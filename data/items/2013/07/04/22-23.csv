This means that information representing information as bits products powers of 2. To get the number of bits (the power of 2 to represent the number), one takes the log, base 2, of the number. If I took the example of 2 bits and limited it to 00, 01, 10, there would be 1.6 bits. Log2(3) = 1.6.",1372978614

He generally builds little cults and then destroys them in fits of mania.  His last title for himself was &quot;Cybernetic Yogi.&quot;<p>After he destroyed his minimalist and post-human blogs and communities he&#x27;s recently got into coding Node.  Presumably because he lost all credibility in the other fields.  His thing is to &quot;quit&quot; services.  He quit Twitter, quit writing, quit Facebook, rejoined Twitter, deleted his blog, undeleted his blog, quit his identity, created a new one, and so on. This would all be very amusing if he didn&#x27;t take it so seriously himself.  He is at best, very mentally ill.<p>I find his current work particularly annoying because he&#x27;s a guy who has about six months of coding experience claiming that Node.js is the messiah of the web.  Just not worth it.  In six months or so Bogue will quit Node and discover the new &#x27;it thing&#x27; and ramble about that somewhere.  The problem is that he writes about topics that he is not adequately educated on.  He does this because he has a deep need to be seen as an <i>expert</i>.<p>Some back story:\n<a href=""http://ariherzog.com/blogger-insists-on-twitter-users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ariherzog.com/blogger-insists-on-twitter-users/</a>\n<a href=""http://adamtervort.com/blog/2011/01/26/minimalism-isnt-dead-youve-just-gone-insane-everett/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adamtervort.com/blog/2011/01/26/minimalism-isnt-dead-...</a><p>&quot;Gwen Bell Blocked Me; Ev Bogue Blocked Me&quot;\n<a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/114850856787256556043/posts/GLYoBb1RHG9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/u/0/114850856787256556043/posts/GLYo...</a><p>&quot;Far Beyond My Ego&quot; (parody)\n<a href=""http://farbeyondmyego.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farbeyondmyego.blogspot.com/</a>",1372978567

Of those system guys I&#x27;d hazard a guess that around 50% of them couldn&#x27;t code at all and only really two could get anything beyond procedural scripting, if that.<p>Not to disrespect these guys because some of them were between good and really good at what they did do, but there were also decisions such as to rely on expensive SANs and proprietary software to tackle issues that could have been and later were replaced by internal code because, in my opinion, these guys were unable to comprehend automation on a scale that a developer could unless they already knew of software available to do such a thing.<p>After that I worked for a massive hosting company with much more segregation of departments and as far as I&#x27;m aware operations didn&#x27;t code despite the deparment being a lot larger than the previous company.<p>It&#x27;s funny because back then I was arguing with both these companies that operations should be driven from an automation stand point utilising devs skills but it wasn&#x27;t exactly a great point since I was the only developer on staff for much of that time in the first company and the second wasn&#x27;t interested at all.<p>For the record, I&#x27;d like to be a devops but I&#x27;m pretty sure I get shut down from those roles from a percieved lack of operations experience and buzzwords.  Much of that because I&#x27;m actually honest and my experience of sysadmins are that they were gatekeepers unwilling to so much as let me login to some of their systems.  Meh.<p>I&#x27;m sure theres a lot of sysadmins out there who a very capable software developers but I think it&#x27;s a stretch attempting to call often simple configuration languages and extremely short glue scripts programming.

Example:<p>SIP invite: INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.example.com SIP/2.0\ntranslated to: HTTP /path/to/invite/bob@biloxi.example.com HTTP/1.1<p>Client sends that HTTP request to HTTP->SIP proxy so that it is translated into specific SIP request method (INVITE).\nWhen proxy gets response from SIP it converts it back to HTTP in similar fashion and deliver to client.\nThat way they couldn&#x27;t forbid SIP signalization on client because on client side it&#x27;s plain old HTTP/HTTPS :-)\nThis should not be problem to implement as library or something like that.<p>In short, simple SIP over HTTP tunnel.<p>P.S.

This should be fairly obvious but the UK != Belgium != Finland != Lithuania, and making sweeping laws across all of the above can/has caused some serious issues.<p>- We were lucky not to have moved over to the Euro, as currently France and Germany are being lumbered with the task of keeping the currency afloat amid financial meltdowns in Greece, Italy, and Spain.

In the widely-publicised extradition case of Abu Hamza (a known islamic fundamentalist, supporter of Al-Qaeda and general dick), the UK moved to extradite him to the USA to face trial but this was blocked by the European court (<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jul/08/abu-hamza-human-rights-ruling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jul/08/abu-hamza-human-rig...</a>).<p>Now the EU has its benefits too which should be weighed against, but let me just emphasise that it&#x27;s not all rosy.<p>[full disclosure: voted liberal democrats]<p>[edit: formatting list]",1372976758

If those in power were to admit that past actions were wrong and move forward to reduce the scope of surveillance, their opponents would crucify, imprison, and sue them.<p>For us to move forward, a little forgiveness would go a long way. We have to make change possible.<p>After all, NSA is doing exactly what the electorate has asked for: moved to prevent small groups and individuals domestic and abroad from taking actions that hurt and kill innocent civilians. Sweeping surveillance is a powerful tool to achieve that end. It&#x27;s also a long-term structural risk for our society. We have to propose tools with similar performance, or get society to accept a small risk of attack.<p>When someone brings the first independently-developed biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons to bear in a coordinated attack, alternative defensive solutions and a civil libertarian populace can provide bulwarks to resist the temptation of always monitoring everyone.

Given the incredible technological progress since the industrial revolution (cooking by fire to walking on the moon and nuclear power in under two centuries), I am highly skeptical of this assumption.</i><p>You shouldn&#x27;t be. Basing your argument on &quot;incredible technological progress since the industrial revolution&quot; and &quot;a billion years&quot; passing is mere extrapolation.<p>Extrapolation of this form is like saying &quot;I ate 1 burger on Monday, 2 on Tuesday and 4 on Wednesday. Given this rate, I&#x27;ll be eating billions of burgers by next week&quot;.<p>For one, early discoveries, when science started its&#x27; pacing were easier. They are &quot;low hanging fruit&quot;. We got the most basic stuff in 2-3 centuries (electricity, magnetism, gravity, modern math, evolution, boolean algebra, sets, engineering), refined them in another (relativity, quantum physics, computing, DNA). At some point you reach a plateau. We are not increasing anywhere near the same pace as in the start in breadth and quality: mostly in volume (more research into various aspects of stuff) and detail (more detailed results).<p>Second, there are other limits. For example, handling stuff below or above some natural limits requires (by the physics of the thing) enormous energy -- and we either don&#x27;t have that or couldn&#x27;t use it without melting earth.<p>There are also limits to our resources -- the very stuff we use to make our tech. From minerals to water. And then there&#x27;s social limits. We could have been wiped out from a WWIII style thing several times during the cold war -- and could be even worse going forward, if on top of the usual greed and diplomatic expansion games there&#x27;s also something like a fight for natural resources (draught, famine, etc).",1372975852

Yes, the server can&#x27;t eavesdrop on the data as-is, but that means you have to trust the hosting provider is using exactly your server.go, thus you have to trust the server completely after all.

Both of these options are extremely hard to achieve.<p>In the former, you have a to get a key in place (which can&#x27;t get transferred through the server for obvious reasons), so that has to be established before any confidential data is being transferred. This is clearly not happening.<p>The latter option is a key exchange protocol such as DiffieHellman. This can work; you can in fact make a key exchange between two parties where an eaves-dropper will be none the wiser for listening in. But then you have another problem: authenticity.

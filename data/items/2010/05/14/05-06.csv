1346680,comment,1346564,1346564,0,0,aristus,,,"I know nothing about Twitter, but in general it's simple. If there are 199 employees, you can't give the 200th more than 0.5%, else that would be unfair, right? That person would have to be something really special, like a CEO or VP, to expect more when coming to the party so late. So that's the absolute maximum ceiling.<p>Usually about 10 to 30% of the company is reserved for employees (the rest goes to the founders and investors --- mostly investors, by this stage). So employee #200's theoretical maximum is down to 0.15% or 0.05%. And she's not going to be the last. Over time more investments and employees mean you get diluted more and more.<p>So do the math yourself, but remember that there are a lot of other factors, like taxes, specific skills, etc etc. If you get acquired, it's not as though they write big novelty checks and hand them out like it's a golf tournament. You exchange startup stock (some of it unvested!) for other-company stock.<p>Risk, impact, autonomy and reward are remarkably correlated to how early you join. But if you are in it for just one of those four things you might have a hard time adjusting to the rest.",1273816416

I worked for a few years for a startup in London that grew from 3 people when I started, to 7 people, and then we got acquired and shipped over to Silicon Valley.<p>Enter the Golden Handcuff phase - definitely my favorite in many ways!  We were treated like royalty for a while - given lots of nice benefits and some very interesting and challenging problems to work on, with resources to match (we purchased more than 1000 powerful servers and put them in a huge cage in a colo!).  We had nice offices with windows.  I had a nice apartment in Palo Alto and a rental car paid for by the company for about a year.<p>After about a year things started to tail off.  Our project became less strategically important to the company that had acquired us.  We were gradually starved of resources and attention.  The perks went away one by one.<p>The transformation was slow, but sure.  Eventually even the offices with windows went away, and we were moved to crappy cubes where you couldn't see windows even if you stood on your desk.<p>In the end, the daily routine for <i>everyone</i> on the team was something like a 10am-4pm work day, filled with browsing reddit and playing ping-pong or air hockey.  Nobody noticed, or if they did, they no longer cared.<p>Finally my Green Card arrived (after three years).  As soon as it did, I quit and joined my next startup (Justin.TV).",1273816231
1346672,comment,1346103,1346614,0,0,pg,,,"Yes, that's a good point.  Another reason not to be a founder is that you don't want to waste your time working on all the random crap that founders inevitably have to.  Though actually the first several employees usually have to do a lot of random crap too.  I'm not sure how big a company has to get before there start to be people who don't have to.

1346671,comment,1346003,1346538,0,0,natrius,,,"The opt-in/opt-out example I've seen the most is 401k contributions. If people have to opt-out of automatically putting part of their paycheck into their 401k, more people make contributions. The idea isn't that people are being <i>tricked</i> into it, although some people probably didn't read carefully enough and don't notice the part of their paycheck missing. The idea is that people are less likely to change from defaults in general. Most people know they should save, so actively saying ""No, I don't want to save"" by checking an opt-out box feels worse then leaving an opt-in box blank.<p>I don't think most people are mistakenly sharing things with more people than they intended on Facebook. When they made the privacy changes and presented everyone with the dialog that let you set all of your privacy settings, 35% of users picked something other than the defaults[1]. It was pretty clear what was going on. For a refresher, here's a video that walks through what the transition actually looked like: <a href=""http://www.allfacebook.com/2009/12/how-to-use-facebooks-new-privacy-transition-tool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allfacebook.com/2009/12/how-to-use-facebooks-new-...</a><p>The only thing Facebook handled poorly in terms of privacy was Instant Personalization. It was... instant. Yelp/Pandora/Docs have my Facebook data linked with my account from the moment I visit the site, which may not be what I want. (I actually like it on Pandora and Yelp. I don't use Docs.) To make matters worse, it's annoyingly difficult to opt out of Instant Personalization altogether. I think this is what offended people the most, then the firestorm made people bring up peripheral non-issues that piled on and made the PR disaster worse.

Despite this, the game plays well (no human perceptable stutter) at full resolution and settings.

While the technocrats and bureaucrats of corporate America's professional management and executive corps have certainly done enough to exaggerate its exclusivity and idiosyncratic character, the fact remains that it's a rather distinct kind of thing.  The qualities that make one a good programmer, a good technologist, a good innovator, etc. aren't necessarily the same qualities that make one a competent or happy business owner, especially when, as a matter of practical necessity, much of the everyday workflow is tedious administrativia or other things banal to engineers.<p>I'm all for the idea that intelligent, confident and well-rounded people are better off doing something more interesting than fighting mediocre fights in the cubicle trenches, but that doesn't mean they're all--or even a majority of them--are entrepreneurially disposed per se.<p>Plus, as has been pointed out elsewhere in this post, joining early often brings equity with it, which, from a certain point of view, is quite an entrepreneurial proposition.<p>If nothing else, it's simply not mathematically possible for everyone to be the chief in the driver's seat;  many technical endeavours seriously require people to build out and scale.",1273813756

I've heard similar things about their compilers class.<p>The required intro classes are also pretty rigorous, although I didn't take them personally. I'd bet that any CMU CS (note that engineering is a very separate program at CMU) grad would at least somewhat know how to program, and will have programmed in assembly and ML, along with the usual Java and C. Obviously you have to check whether they got C's in the big rigorous classes or not, but it's basically a good bar. It would be impossible to graduate and then fail FizzBuzz, for example, which to my understanding is not true of most CS programs.<p>The one main complaint I had with it was that the required freshman theory course (251), which is supposed to be this great legendary weed-out thing, was just a hodgepodge of badly specified discrete math, and still is, to my knowledge. It was hard, but in my opinion not in a good way. Maybe it works as a weed-out but not as an educational tool. The later required algorithms course, 451, was much better.",1273813674

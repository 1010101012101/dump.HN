We had investors, and mostly living off ""ramen noodles.""   At 10 months in, we turned it on to make money.  I still remember the fun of getting our first paying customer, and then checking everything over and over again to make sure everything went well.  It wasn't until late spring of next year that we started seeing real progress and upward momentum, and could support and our operation without needing investment.",1299509972

2297261,comment,2297155,2297155,0,0,smanek,,,"I went through a length evaluation process of Riak recently, and came away with a generally positive impression.<p>First of all, it's beautifully engineered, as long as you just need a KV store or a graph DB (I wasn't in love with the MapReduce stuff, but that's another story). None of the hassle that Hadoop/Hbase have about some nodes being special (HBase Master, HDFS Namenode, etc). Also, no running multiple daemons per server (e.g., no distinction between regionserver and datanode daemons, like HBase). Easy config files, simple HTTP API (so you can just throw an off the shelf load balancer like HAProxy in front of it), and lots of little things that just make life easier.<p>I also really like how it's very explicit about the CAP tradeoffs it makes - with powerful conflict resolution available for when consistency has been sacrificed (instead of trying to sweep the issue under the rug, like many other distributed dbs do).<p>However, there are a few downsides.<p>First, as mentioned in the article, with the default backend (a kv-store called 'bitcask') all the keys per node have to fit in memory (and each key has, on the order of, 20 bits of overhead, IIRC). Annoyingly, this fact isn't noted anywhere in the Riak documentation that I saw (although, there is a work-around by using the InnoDB backed). This won't matter too much for many use cases, but it can be pretty painful if you're not expecting it.<p>Second, you can guard against data loss by specifying N copies of each piece of data are stored on your cluster. However, under some conditions (<a href=""https://issues.basho.com/show_bug.cgi?id=228"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.basho.com/show_bug.cgi?id=228</a>), the data may be replicated on less than N distinct nodes. So, the failure of less than N nodes could result in dataloss.<p>Finally, to the best of my knowledge, the largest Riak clusters in production are around 60 nodes, while Hadoop has 2000 node clusters running (e.g., FB) in production. Perfectly acceptable for most users, but just one more thing to worry about if you're planning to roll out a large cluster (more potential for 'unknown unknowns', so to speak).",1299509649

He thus has access to the most powerful educational sources in the history of human civilization.  Many people simply will not be educated.  Especially if they are rewarded for ignorance.  There comes a certain threshold of incoherence where a person should be simply ignored.  They are being disrespectful of their listeners.  Of course then I see them upvoted on hacker news, where the average IQ is probably a standard deviation above the norm.  In situations like this ridicule is the correct response if it alerts people who might not know any better from paying attention.

2297253,comment,2297180,2297180,0,0,bane,,,"I've worked at a few startups in the past and can give you this history:<p>1) First one was an ISP, boot-strapped. 4 years. Mildly profitable, sold to a larger ISP.<p>2) The next one was a short stint with a e-retailer. They were almost immediately profitable, but needed some serious cash to grow. So it sold within a couple of years and the founders all still work there. It's wildly profitable now, but alas none of the founders can capitalize on that success outside of a steady job.<p>3) Next one was a NLP middle-ware company (yes, they exist) that had been around for more than a decade, I came in near the end and worked there for 3 years. It sold right after I left (I didn't have equity). I believe it was unprofitable.<p>4) After a few years bouncing around mega-corporations I came back to startup land. We're 4 years in. <i>Just</i> hit profitability this year and then the Congressional funding disaster hit (we're almost entirely government business). We're going to see if we can make it through, but we may end up selling.<p>5) My wife and I just launched our new company www.kymalabs.com (her main job, my part-time job). We'll see how long that goes! We'd actually like it to grow enough to pay our bills and give us long-term employment, but who knows!",1299509518

Or ""make a concordance of all the terms in a problem space, for use by other code"".<p>And making these pieces is also not at all like the process described.

That's why there are New York archetypes of Korean green grocers, Chinese dry cleaners, Greek diner owners, etc (albeit these are rapidly shifting). The large number of Jewish-owned businesses in NY speaks to the historical discrimination against Jews (and not just some stereotypical belief about business acumen).

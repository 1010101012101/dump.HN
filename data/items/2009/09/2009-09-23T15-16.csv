When I was in high school my parents told me the didn't have anything saved for me and I'd have to pay for college. I spent my entire junior and senior years applying for scholarships. There was one really big $20k scholarship in particular though that I thought I was a shoe-in for.<p>Well, the notification date passed and I hadn't heard anything. So I called and called, trying to find out what was going on. The obvious answer was someone else had won all of the 5 scholarships they awarded. But I wouldn't stop until I knew for sure. Finally, I found out that they had all been given out, but that 3 students had declined (they were school-specific). These 3 were going to go back into the budget for next year. I pleaded my case with one of the administrators, and within 24 hours, one of those awards was mine. $20k just like that. And there were 2 more just sitting there if anyone else would have done as I had.<p>When a magazine ignores your article, it's up to you to make it impossible to ignore.<p>Anyway, back to your question... ask your partners to hand over the company. If that doesn't work, buy them out. How much? Well, how long would it take you to start over, and how much is your time worth? (i.e. (time to recreate) * (value of your time) * (their ownership of the company) = buyout at this point, because you don't have any realistic valuation criteria beyond that)<p>It might be a good idea to start something new.

It insinuates that anyone who claims otherwise must despise current labor unions by contrast.  And it leaves open the possibility that you're setting the reader up for a sudden about face where you come up with some non-obvious reasoning for why labor unions were founded by heros after all.<p>The second eulogizes the heros who founded labor unions.  Then makes it clear that there is no reason to think that current union leaders would be capable of less if asked.  And concludes that the shrinking of unions must be due to external circumstances.<p>With that in mind I can draw up version 3 that says what version 2 does but not at length.<p>""Why are labor unions shrinking today?  Some say that we have lesser leaders today.  Admittedly today's leaders do not regularly face hired thugs, etc like their predecessors did.  But there is no reason to believe that they would be any less capable of heroism at need.  The cause must be external.""<p>I made the same major points as #3, without causing offense, with fewer words than your short version.

The problem is the criteria itself, in particular:   1)  the definition of the asset's value,  2) the  definition of maintenance costs, and 3) the notion that the asset should be considered ""disposed"" when those ill-defined maintenance costs exceed that ill-defined value.<p>The problem with #1 is that an asset's value to its owner is only partially represented by the amount of money for which it can be liquidated.<p>The problem with #2, is that they include operational costs (fuel, etc.) that one would bear regardless of which car they owned.<p>The problem with #3 is your concept of 'disposable', which may work for you but is not universal.  Someone else might only consider it 'disposable' when problems begin to appear in a notoriously expensive-to-repair subsystem, like the transmission.   And, even then, the car tends to not actually be disposed because its parts can be used to keep other similar models alive.<p>I guess I feel like your lament hinges upon one very narrow  possible meaning of the word 'disposable'.

Our capture system doesn't rely on video encoding, or Java plugins, or installing Javascript on a site. This allows our test recorder to be much more flexible than our competitors. We're also building a webcam capture feature - something that de-facto in traditional usability testing but so many remote usability testing solution overlook.<p>At the minute we just want to get something out there (our current motto is 'Minimum Viable Product') - want to get users on-board and then use the feedback to build in features.<p>We do want to offer access to testers, like you mentioned. This idea we're currently calling 'Business B' (we will think of a better name) and we're looking to start developing this soon after launch.

839424,comment,839153,839304,0,0,skolor,,,"First off: 4 year graduation rates are stupid. There's no other way to put it, they're a stupid measurement and one colleges should stop paying so much attention to. At my school, they've made a huge push to try and get everyone out the doors within 4 years, to the point they have informed academic advisors that they should be advising students to cut corners and ""just graduate"". While it may be a worthwhile standard for a private university, where a large majority either doesn't work or works a very small number of hours for ""spending money"", at a public university, with many students paying their own way through college, its a bad measurement. Its better for everyone for a student to take 6 years to graduate and walk out the doors with half the debt of someone who graduates in 4 years (or less).<p>As far as college/vocational schools, if it is possible, you should go to college. However, don't study what you want to go into, study something tangentally related to it (unless you are going into highly focused field, like engineering or a medical degree, and even then try and get as far away from what you want to as possible while still being on track). Going to a school I was ""undermatched"" for, and going into the computer science program, I was bored out of my mind, and just wasn't getting much out of it. After switching to statistics, I've found my classes much more enjoyable, and have vastly increased my understanding of both statistics and computer science.<p>While it may not hold true for everyone, I've found that working in something tangentially related to what I wanted to do (Computer ""stuff"", originally), I learned a massive amount about both the field I wanted to work in, and in the field I was studying. While it may not help me get a job, I learned quite a bit more than I would have otherwise, which is why I went to college in the first place.",1253719735

The Presidential Records Act is being, appropriately I believe, extended to social media. The average citizen probably had no idea the act existed; probably more so for anyone who is buying into the wildest exaggerations.<p>As the post explains, 'The PRA also extends to communications from people outside the White House.  So if a lobbyist or CEO emails the White House, that communication is a presidential record and will eventually be made public.  The same holds true for correspondence received by the White House from the public.  Because of the PRA, Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and Bush all treated letters, faxes, and other communications from the public as presidential records.'<p>'Instead of sending an email, people often now post on someoneâs profile or comment on a video or photo that's been uploaded.  When people want to tell the White House what they think, theyâll often do the same thing on our social media pages.  A lot of times, we solicit this feedback because we want to hear from you.<p>These new types of communications from individuals to the White House, even though they take a different form, are governed by the PRA.'<p>So yes, in the past if you sent a letter to the White House it was archived, but it is an entirely different mindset for someone posting a comment, or sending an @whitehouse on Twitter. We're talking about archiving, for public record, something you probably quickly typed, not a letter you sat down, wrote, and sent via the mail.<p>Is there anything sinister? No. But I think it makes perfect sense that this is something that needs to be explained to the general public who are a) woefully ignorant of how their government works, and b) rightfully suspicious of how laws written decades ago, which weren't designed for social media, let alone the Internet, are being interpreted and applied on the fly.",1253719512

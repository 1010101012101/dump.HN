I'd say all, but its probably only 99.9% and someone would bring up the X-3 perhaps confusing its pitch-roll coupling with slow flight or something weird like that.<p>The stall angle of attack usually is not coincident with peak lift to drag ratio.  In fact I'm not even sure you can FAA certify an airframe where peak L/D AoA is ever at stall AoA at any airspeed, they'd probably totally freak out about spin susceptibility, or at least I certainly would.  So you have an engine failure and automatically by training go into best AoA flight mode, with that design any turning or even a little wind gust or whatever would probably mean a possibly unrecoverable spin, which would kinda suck.  I mean I think you could theoretically design a wing airfoil that way, and physically build it, but you'd get flamed pretty severely about it.  I think this would also make takeoffs and landings overly unstable/exciting.  Airframes traditionally have pretty cruddy maneuverability/performance at stall AoAs although you could probably fix that (lots of exotic jet fighters do pretty well under those flight conditions, then again they aren't ""most planes""...)<p>Also you're going to get pilots and CFIs all wound up, by trying to talk about using throttle to control speed, at least theoretically to reduce pilot induced oscillations you'll formally be told that AoA should be used to control airspeed and throttle should be used to control rate of climb (aka altitude, in the calculus integrated sense).  A smooth experienced pilot makes it very hard visually to tell exactly which control input at which time is having what effect, but at least in theory this is what you'll be trained at least for major flight maneuvers, in practice very small scale triming / autopilot is usually the other way around as you describe, or so it seems.  And those ""in between"" adjustments make a formal definition kinda complicated, or meaningless.<p>Piloting is a very hands on experience, so its like trying to teach someone gymnastics by writing articles.",1370443506

But in many cases in practice, that isn't the case, because those facilities have either not been built, or not opened. In the U.S., since the long-planned Yucca Mountain facility has never opened, most nuclear waste is stored on-site at the reactor complex, in above-ground facilities. For the first few years it's immersed in cooling pools [1], and then subsequently is parked in metal/concrete cylinders [2]. This is considered interim storage awaiting final burial in geologically stable vaults, but without Yucca Mountain the ""interim"" storage has become de-facto permanent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spent_fuel_pool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spent_fuel_pool</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_cask_storage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_cask_storage</a>",1370442648

No death marches. Lots of vacation time. A super flexible schedule. All we ask in return for it is for you to do awesome things while you're here.<p>- Excellent People: We hire nice, smart people, who are awesome at what they do.  We go out to lunch, play games, have drinks, and hang out together.  You're a part of the team on day one.<p>Fun: Foosball room (yes, it's a high-end Tornado table), beer tap, soda fountain, free snacks and drinks.  Intelligentsia whole-bean coffee, burr grinder, aeropress, super-automatic espresso machine.  Weekly yoga classes.  Play some RBI Baseball or Mario Kart on the Wii.  Quoridor matches at lunch time (you've never heard of it, but you will learn to love it).<p>Training and Conferences: We're a Platinum sponsor of Windy City Rails.  Think there's another conference we should sponsor?  We're up for it.  Which conference do you prefer, RailsConf or RubyConf?  Want to go learn about data visualization from Tufte?  Maybe you'd like to take some classes towards a Master's Degree?  We'll help you out with all of it.<p>Hardware: Top of the line MacBook Pro.  24' displays.  Whatever accessories you want.  No desk phones.  Need something else to help you get your job done?  Let us know, we'll do our best to hook you up.<p>Autonomy: We only hire adults, so we treat everyone like an adult.  You know the best ways to get your job done, so we leave it up to you.  It sounds obvious, but you probably know it isn't always true.  At Centro, it is.<p>Compensation: We offer competitive salaries, bonuses, and a stock option program. Plus, 401(k) matching, great health care, gym memberships and lots of other little stuff.<p>If you'd like to learn more, grab coffee with our head of engineering, check out some of our work on GitHub, let me know.  Or, do you know folks that may be interested?  Make the introductions and if we hire 'em, we'll send you a check for a cool $2,500/person.  Thank you!",1370442175

I face slow downs in the issue tracker, the git repos themselves (I only use command line), and the web interface to browse a project (code, history, pull requests). I notice a slow down about once a day. Some features, like the contributors graph, are always dead slow. About 10-20% of PR merge attempts fail, and I have to click the button again, sometimes multiple times. I see the Unicorn fail page or some Octocat fail page often enough.<p>It makes me think exactly of what you describe, a combination of Rails perf / scalability and perhaps a lack of strong backend engineering, I'm not sure.<p>Right now the problems are in the level of a mild annoyance / surprise that a company like GH has these issues. If it gets worse, I would consider moving away. But because I truly love the UI and overall functionality, it's a positive tradeoff for us at the moment.<p>You're very welcome regarding the YouTrack suggestion.",1370441015

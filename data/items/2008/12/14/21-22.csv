On the other hand, Python is successfully making it into the corporate world, which is obvious from job boards. Which is probably because Python's modularity and clean OO-ness plays well with the hierarchical culture of commercial vendors.<p>No, this is a tough question. I still don't know.",1229291808
397689,comment,397426,397426,0,0,tdavis,,,"The thing I've always hated about eggs is that invariably something that uses an egg won't have the permissions to write to the default egg cache. It has gotten to the point now that if I know something is going to install an egg, I just do <i>setup.py build</i> and copy the build folder into <i>site-packages</i>. It's just not worth the annoyance for what is, at least as far as I can tell, no gain.<p>(Edit: read cache)",1229291756
397688,comment,396914,397559,0,0,old-gregg,,,"I guess the point I was trying to make was this: 99.99% of the code running on ""web 2.0 server"" somewhere in California is GPL/LGPL stuff, good part of which originates from Europe. Therefore it's very foolish of us to even hint that ""Europeans are lazy"" or inferior in <i>any</i> way. Google, Yahoo and Sun might not be from Europe, but Linus, Guido, DHH and thousands less famous are.<p>Moreover, I feel SV entrepreneurs should be far more polite and humble because they have a terrible track record of returning the favor: where is scribbd's iPaper's code? We all know it's built on top of OO, why can't OO contributors host their own Office docs on their own personal servers using iPaper from scribbd?",1229291535

397683,comment,397440,397642,0,0,mojuba,,,"Thanks for your suggestions. Yes, I checked Lua of course, it's neat, but as I said elsewhere, the <i>if ... end</i> syntax is not considered because I find it slightly less appealing than C and Python.<p>As for interpreter vs. compiler, I thought about this. One approach is to build a simple VM-based system with the entire language infrastructure in place (fundamental types, minimal standard library), which is not much harder than to write an interpreter with the same infrastructure. Then start fine-tuning the VM itself and possibly thinking about the JIC. The original compiler code, which is not the biggest part of your system, is left almost intact in this case.<p>As opposed to the ""interpreter - first"" approach, where you will be throwing away some significant portions of your code once you start writing the real compiler. I thought it would be a waste of time. Interpreters and compilers are too different in almost every respect.",1229291359

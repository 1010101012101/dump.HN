Actual policing and &quot;policing&quot; of human behavior, looks and other norms  appear to me to be inextricably linked. I&#x27;m sorry to single out this instance in particular  but  reinforcement of the local mores happens even through  seemingly innocent behavior like your ought-statement above,  which I happen to agree with but some people might not have, especially in the past. Police officers, persecutors, judges, etc. are  affected by their own set of ought-statements in work as well as in life.  (And the effect is exacerbated when you implement trial by jury.)<p>On my part, I  cannot come up with one historical example of people generally satisfied with  how significantly different outsiders to their community policed them. I have come to think it&#x27;s more or less an inevitability and the best we can do is to make it possible for people to freely move to where they find the mores agreeable.",1424645961

And at that point I imagine the advances in computation and sensing will drive product refreshes. Even battery tech. Which all sound familiar...<p>Sure some of it can be over-the-air as Tesla has already shown, but the same happens on our current tech yet we still update the hardware pretty frequently.  A new, better autopilot may not be able to run on a 3 year old car processor.  Could you swap out the cars brains?  Sure.  Would that be lucrative for the car manufacturer?  maybe not.<p>I think the biggest argument against what I&#x27;m proposing is that computers/phones have huge form-factor constraints that favor tightly integrated components - it&#x27;s why RAM is no longer user replaceable in new, thinner macs.

Facebook though seems like a good medium, but apparently the people that like my page don&#x27;t interact with the content so they don&#x27;t get to see it in their feeds.<p>Email newsletters are great because people can easily subscribe/unsubscribe at their leisure and I know who is reading them whereas it is pretty much a mystery on other services.<p>From a readers perspective, your comments are exactly why I love instagram so much. I can easily follow/unfollow people and my newsfeed is only filled with posts from people I followed plus the occasional ad.

9091585,comment,9086029,9086029,0,0,insoluble,,,"One of the most important cases for desktop applications is when the software must interface with local hardware. This is especially so when that hardware requires large amounts of data throughput, short latencies, and or enhanced security. For reasons including safety, efficiency, and simplicity, not all hardware devices are equipped to communicate over the Internet. Furthermore, when interfacing with local hardware such as robotics interfaces, why in the world would I want the software to run in the cloud rather than locally? Sure, there are a couple of special cases for this, such as when the fruits of the system are to be publicly or remotely accessible (a public webcam, for example), but there are plenty of cases where local access is much more appropriate.<p>A particularly noteworthy example is automated manufacturing. In this case, it would be nearly absurd to run the control software in the cloud rather than locally. Would you really want an Internet hiccup to cost you a whole batch of units? What about the software that controls a self-driving car? Would you want to ride in that car when the software is running in the cloud rather than locally?",1424645465

(But do you know what IS inconvenient? Being hit by a bug on production in your Ruby program that could have been prevented by a static type checker).<p>- No, this is not a case of No True Scotsman. First, you seem to misunderstand how <i>fromMaybe</i> is used (have you EVER programmed in Haskell?). Unlike other languages, where null can hit you by surprise, the programmer ALWAYS chooses the default value for <i>fromMaybe</i>. Since HE chooses it, it&#x27;s not an accident. It can never happen by accident, as with null. Repeat after me: this. is. not. a. case. of. the. no. true. scotsman. fallacy. &quot;So there is this Scottish guy...&quot; &quot;Wait, what if this is a Scotsman from Mars?&quot; &quot;But Scotsmen are from Scotland!&quot; &quot;A-HA! Fallacy!&quot; This gets old fast.<p>- No, a programming language with additional safeties is logically safer than one without, <i>all else being equal</i> (i.e. if no other safeties get removed instead). Especially since those safeties don&#x27;t prevent you from <i>also</i> applying every engineering practice from the other, no-safe language. You can do all the fancy testing you do for your Ruby programs in Haskell as well! In fact, a lot of interesting testing tools have come from the Haskell community, such as QuickCheck (aka property testing). In fact, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there was a RubyCheck nowadays.<p>- No, Haskell programmers aren&#x27;t smug fools who believe that because their programs compile then they must be correct, and therefore no additional testing or QA is necessary. You keep bringing this old nonsense up, and you&#x27;re the only one who believes it. Please accept as a given that <i>no-one</i> believes this and never bring it up again.<p>> <i>What do you mean by &quot;safer&quot; here? Let&#x27;s say &quot;type-safety&quot; means &quot;a type-checker enforces some constraints&quot; and &quot;practical-safety&quot; means &quot;more likely to be correct, all else being equal&quot;. It seems you think &quot;type-safety&quot; == &quot;safety&quot; == &quot;practical-safety&quot;, by definition.</i><p>Actually, rather than being equal, what I think is that an increase in one implies an increase in the other. A type-checker enforcing some constraints automatically makes your language <i>practically safer</i> than one without it. It&#x27;s yet another tool in your toolset, one that gets automatically applied by the compiler. I get that, by convenience, some people want to write programs without some safeties; that&#x27;s an issue of <i>convenience</i>, which is separate.<p>> <i>Obviously, using a safety is not much effort. How much effort is required to satisfy the Haskell compiler?</i><p>Not much. Haskell programmers everywhere do it daily. What&#x27;s your point? Have you written a program in Haskell and found it too hard?<p>Please think before you want to lecture me again about deductive and inductive reasoning. You sound condescending instead of clever.<p>I refuse to discuss this with you any further until you drop the  sarcasm and answer this simple question: how fluent are you with Haskell?

9091530,comment,9089008,9089338,0,0,pharke,,,"> Remember that inequality was huge way before the industrial revolution. You know how feudalism worked, right? A few dozen filthy-rich noble families + 99% of population in abject misery, was the rule for most of Europe in the best part of the previous couple millennia.<p>I&#x27;m going to ask for a source on this, because this smacks of hyperbole or at least ignorance.  It seems that when you refer to feudalism [1], you may mean manorialism [2] and more specifically the institution of serfdom [3].  First, I am not arguing that the life of a serf was in any way ideal.  They were the lowest caste of society and were afforded very little in the way of self determination, but they were not wholly without legal protections and rights, they were often paid a wage for their labour or could at the very least pay their debts directly with their labour, and it was generally in the direct interest of their lord to uphold their end of the contract by providing compensation, protection, court hearings, and facilities for processing and storing the food produced on their lands.<p>While it would obviously have made for an extremely poor life had one been born on land held by a cruel or careless lord I wouldn&#x27;t say that living and working in a workhouse [4] or mill would have been much better, at least as a serf you would have a right to live with your family in a hovel and work a portion of the land for your own benefit.  12 hour days in a dark, loud, and extremely dangerous textile mill and going home to an equally dark, loud, and stinking tenement room shared with a dozen other people sounds more like abject misery to me.<p>The beginnings of improvement in personal rights and freedoms began more so with Magdeburg rights [5] and town law, providing an alternative for serfs who were able or fortunate enough to exchange their tenure, buy out of it, or simply flee it for life in a town.  That was as early as the 10th century.  Things improved even more during the Renaissance and after the Black Death which resulted in an increase in the value of labour and saw the decline of serfdom in Western Europe.<p>I would argue that a deterioration in living conditions for skilled labourers brought on by the industrial revolution [6] and the end of the open field system [7] resulted in a greater necessity to organize to avoid further deprivation.  Also, peasant revolts were not unheard of [6] and often began in the villages that formed the centre of life on the manor estate.<p>The life of a serf was far from pastoral but the change in living conditions from the late Roman Empire up to the modern era has not followed a constant upward trend and even today our society is quite capable of reaching local minima.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouse</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdeburg_rights"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdeburg_rights</a>\n[6] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite</a>\n[7] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_field_system"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_field_system</a>\n[8] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_peasant_revolts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_peasant_revolts</a>",1424644631

The thought of arresting me or putting me in my place crossed their mind on occasion, I&#x27;m sure, but there were usually, maybe always, cameras rolling when these occasions arose. Many people aren&#x27;t lucky enough to get through police interactions without harm.<p>Cops in the US are simply terrifying, and in many jurisdictions simply out of control. Not all the time, and not with all people (you could live your whole life without ever having a bad incident with a cop if you were born white/wealthy in America, so it&#x27;s easy to be oblivious to this). I was oblivious for years...I read Reason magazine back then, and so I was aware of the deadly no-knock drug raids. But, the regulatory targeting of minorities to force them out of their homes and neighborhoods so that gentrification can proceed at will, the police targeting of the homeless and the mentally ill to make downtown districts more profitable for their owners, and drug enforcement only on the poorest in our communities, is the dirty little secret of &quot;progressive&quot; city governments.<p>My current home city, Austin, is allegedly quite progressive. And, yet, illegal camping (i.e. sleeping while homeless) can result in a $500 ticket, and APD regularly clears out homeless camps, arresting anyone with drugs.",1424642995

I saw so many friends, women I know on the Internet, and I cried tears of joy three times during the speeches.  It&#x27;s hard to be what you can&#x27;t see.  Jessica and Kat have done an AMAZING job of putting female founders in front of us so we can look and say, hey you know, Kathryn Minshew did YC, I CAN DO IT TO.<p>Even though our startup didn&#x27;t make it into the last YC batch, we&#x27;re applying again.  We love the community, we love the yc philosophy and approach to building products and we want to inspire other women just like us to apply.<p>Thank you for writing this letter and sharing what we all think, yesterday was incredible.",1424642582

If I&#x27;m using some other module, I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to have to remember the order in which the parameters come, or be forced to check documentation or implementation to know for sure.<p>With an object, I can use a console log or a debug break point and immediately see the key value pairs (hopefully well-named) without having to check the function implementation or docs to see in which order the authors decided to return (or yield, etc.) values.<p>Can we just agree now not to use array destructuring as an excuse for returning multiple disparate values in an array? Or at least in only some idiomatic form? [error, value] would actually make sense to me, as it follows popular Node conventions.",1424642459

C also lacks function closures, so important abstractions like function composition, partial application and higher order functions.<p>That, on the other hand, is a core feature of functional languages (what does it mean to have functions as first class citizens if one cannot manipulate them in an algebraic way?). I actually think it&#x27;s the only needed feature to qualify.<p>> It also lacks type parameterization and polymorphism.<p>These are strongly typed languages features, I wouldn&#x27;t define a functional language by it (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary), although it appears in many of them.",1424642442

Care to back that up somehow?<p>Consider that free(er) competition results in quality increasing and prices decreasing. That&#x27;s how it works when providers have to please their customers more than their competitors. It&#x27;s <i>extremely</i> simple, and axiomatic.<p>So when you see that Uber is just one service provider in the market for paid transportation, how do you think it could possibly be better <i>for us</i> that &quot;regulations&quot; prevent Uber from operating, i.e. <i>competing</i> with government-approved taxi services?<p>> <i>This one&#x27;s easy - people who live in a residential block who didn&#x27;t sign up to live in a hotel.</i><p>It&#x27;s like, you could have some.. rules about how to behave in rental apartments, and they could even be included in the contracts!<p>&quot;Dear Customer. Because lots of ordinary people live in this building and have to wake up early, it&#x27;s important that you behave nicely and don&#x27;t make noise after 22:00. If you find this unacceptable, we can&#x27;t rent this apartment to you&quot;.<p>Is that so difficult? Or do we genuinely need some distant, nebulous organization to prevent people from being able to voluntarily accept terms and trades like that?",1438779583

I didn&#x27;t think that people would be interested in my personal use case, because I am rather an outlier.<p>Airflow is one concern. I am hot, and stay hot. Along with that, it tends to fog up the lenses and get somewhat sweaty.

Its the proverbial technology pendulum.  It seems obvious that we&#x27;ll continue our momentum and maybe even abandon the generic browser and revert to the (now mobile-based) fat client past.<p>Much of the article seems devoted to concerns about proprietary protocols and closes with a plea to keep protocols open with a published specification.  I think this is a reasonable concern and a noble plea, but yet also an (unfortunately) unreasonable request.  Companies are developing their protocols to support their needs, not yours.<p>Its reasonable to want access to the data companies are collecting.  Its valuable data.  But these companies are not in the data services business.  And if they were, its reasonable for them to charge a handsome price for the access you are looking for.  Imagine the black eye a company would get for trying that approach.<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s a view that says, users freely give the data so they should be able to freely get it back.  But there&#x27;s a counter argument that users are &quot;compensated&quot; for contributing their data in the form of free access to the services it provides.  Given the amount of time people spend on social apps, its reasonable to think they value the &quot;free&quot; service highly.<p>IIRC there was a start-up that attempted to build an alternative social network based on open standards... It didn&#x27;t go very far.  Perhaps people need to learn to vote with their actions.  Maybe we need to try that again and convince more of the influential technical folks to jump ship.  Maybe through competition the non-open establish players can be shown the value of openness.",1438778099

It&#x27;s not even acceptable everywhere, as some countries (Europe for example) do require LBT in the 5 GHz band, which LTE-U does not do. So I&#x27;ll skip that part.<p>For the 3GPP standard LTE-LAA, a fundamental reason that it requires a primary channel in licensed bands is that the way LTE works does require an always-on, reserved channel. This is the way LTE do works in licensed bands: the channel is fully reserved for LTE, under full eNB control. Changing this fundamental assumption would be a major breakage, and much much more effort. The result would be very different. Whereas using LTE carrier aggregation, with a primary channel in a licensed band and using the unlicensed 5 GHz band for downlink only (UL has some added challenges that makes it unpractical) secondary channel(s) with LBT is not too difficult. It&#x27;s an incremental changes, but does not require breaking a fundamental assumption.\nAnd in this case, LTE-LAA could perform like other technologies (to be checked, but possible on principle).<p>So even if it fits with the operator wishes, the assisted part is also the sane way to add 5 GHz support to LTE from a pure technological point of view.",1438777138

It works, because if you only care about one given pixel of the resulting image you can calculate the previous image pixels lazily. It allowed really convenient compositions, like composing a Mandelbrot-set generator and a zoom filter then zooming into the set indefinitely only adjusting the zoom filter.<p>I didn&#x27;t try ImagePlay yet.

I didn&#x27;t intend to &quot;frame the academics as the bad guys&quot; but I can see how it came off that way.<p>To be blunt, I don&#x27;t think that the current generation&#x27;s academics are at fault <i>at all</i>. This rotten system was built decades before they came on the field, and they&#x27;re just trying to survive in it.<p>I&#x27;m putting blame, mostly, on the older generations: the Boomers, the Silents, and the &quot;Greatest&quot; Generation. They had it so good that they must have assumed that they could just ignore the teaching part of the job, so they devalued it, creating a state where even those who want to focus on teaching aren&#x27;t rewarded for it.<p>I don&#x27;t even fault specific people. I fault the tenure system. I understand its value, but I also see how it allows the older, comfortable generation to behave in a way that hurts the young. The blow-off-the-teaching attitude isn&#x27;t something I see in most 30-year-old professors (and, to the extent that it exists, it&#x27;s a rational response to a system that doesn&#x27;t reward it at all). It&#x27;s something that started decades ago. The tenured professor, who <i>could</i> blow off his teaching and administrative duties with minimal consequence, could say to his juniors, &quot;I get five papers out per year, so I don&#x27;t see why you can&#x27;t do it.&quot; Academia has this weird dichotomous system where you&#x27;re either almost impossible to fire (tenured) or treated as human garbage, with nothing in-between.<p>Of course, university administrators and politicians are also at fault, but one has to wonder why they&#x27;ve decided to impoverish academia. Many of those administrators are ex-academics, and the politicians&#x27; anti-intellectualism and resentment of academia has to come from <i>somewhere</i>. To blame academics entirely is to miss a lot, for sure, but one has to assign to them (again, with blame falling most on the older or retired ones who were most influential when this mess began) a fair share of the responsibility.",1438776167

You will be taxable (Calif state income tax) on the income generated inside of it. Federal income tax is trivially easy to eliminate on an RRSP. Just say ""Form 8891"" to the person doing your US and California tax returns.<p>If the RRSP is small you might as well just kill it because it will cause you endless tax hassles in the US.<p>Oh and one more thing. If you have more than US$10,000 in accounts in Canada once you're a citizen, file Form TD F 90-22.1. See my blog or ask me for horror stories.

In addition to the innovative Wii UI, Nintendo launched a variety of family oriented games that took advantage of the Wii controllers, it had a brand and bevy of characters that it could leverage that resonated with families and kids (e.g., Mario), the Wii console was small and quiet, and the Wii was priced well below the competition.<p>For Kinect to succeed in the market, Microsoft must introduce a variety of complementary (and compelling) games, it needs to develop a collection of characters and stories that resonate with target customers of the Kinect, and it needs to carefully consider pricing, given that the price of the Xbox 360 plus Kinect (+ additional accessories) could overshoot the comfort level of a majority of consumers, especially in view of the economic recession.<p>Ultimately, the success of Kinect hinges not only on the Kinect hardware but also on Microsoft's ability to develop a coherent ""Kinect strategy"" that includes games, characters/stories, branding and marketing, pricing, and so forth. And a key issue is developing a ""Kinect strategy"" that does not alienate Xbox 360's most important customers, which at present are hardcore gamers. These are the gamers paying for Live and providing the Xbox 360 with the highest (game) attach rate among 7th generation consoles.",1288940126

But it is true.<p>Let's look at Cassandra as an absolute prime example of what I'm talking about.  The original version of Cassandra was a code drop by Facebook.  It made some news in tech blogs, and then mostly everyone forgot about it.  A few months later, another version was dropped, but this time nobody really noticed.<p>Then Jonathan Ellis found the codebase, imported it into GitHub, and started doing development on it in the open, and accepting patches.  Sure enough, more people started to take notice and watch as development happened, and started to contribute back.  A community started forming.  Facebook then donated the project to the Apache Software Foundation, where it's continued to be developed in the open and thrive.  Now it's supported by many companies; in fact new companies have sprung up specifically on the premise of providing support for it.<p>Empirically speaking, the software has had much more development since it switched to being developed in the open.  Subjectively speaking, it's simply a vastly improved piece of software from when it was handled as a ""code drop"", it's boosted Facebook's credibility in the eyes of developers for having started the project, and it's gained much more popularity.<p>So, going back to F#, what are the goals that Microsoft is trying to further with its platform?  I'll posit three (of which there are certainly more): to increase the reach of the .NET platform, to boost Microsoft mindshare, and to increase developer productivity.<p>Each one of those goals are served better by moving to an open development model, for fairly obvious reasons.<p>I didn't mean for this response to become so long, but it just seems to me that this is such an obvious and unfortunate blunder that it renders the whole open sourcing of the language nearly worthless.",1288938559

It might sound shocking to the Github generation, but there was a time <i>not too long ago</i> where important work with millions on the line routinely got done with one copy of the code sitting on a single workstation, and collaboration happening over network shares or email.  I worked at one of those places.  It sucked.

Less relevant for, e.g., Rails web apps.

The best connectivity I can get is either a consumer-grade DSL connection for approx $60/month, or a symmetric T1 for approx $500/month. I can't get Comcast ""business class"" unless I want to spend tens of thousands of dollars trenching someone else's parking lot for the installation.<p>The same was true at my 2 previous office locations, so it's not like the current setup is an anomaly.<p>If I wanted to be right in the middle of downtown San Jose, I could be in the same building as MAE-West and could probably get sweet connectivity - but that location would make my clients sad (parking is tough and not free) so I'm not gonna do it.<p>I shared office space for awhile with a guy who had a fixed wireless install - it was OK (the connection was fast but sometimes flaky) but it still amazes me how tough it is to get meaningful connectivity in a major metropolitan area on the West Coast.

The 3-way handshake is just the first 3 messages in that chain, and the TCP channel doesn't exist until that many have occured, but the unreliable ""phantom"" UDP channel doesn't go away once reliability is established. The head/outstanding link in the chain is always unreliable.<p>I think TCP is a strange mental error: nobody ever needed a to make TCP a real transport protocol next to ICMP and UDP, etc. It didn't need an IP transport number of it's own. TCP is just the idea of ""reliability"" and can exist entirely in software (and for that reason should, since it's one less thing to maintain in the kernel). UDP is enough. (and ICMP, for example addresses a different problem: out-of-band network feedback.)<p>Existing code would work the same. I could still ask for a ""TCP"" connection, and start sending with the real data carried by UDP and benefit from 1 round trip if I don't need to send more.<p>TFO does that too -- allows some of the unreliability to creep in in the hope that the system is reliable enough that it's worth it -- but it also adds complexity to the existing name ""TCP"", and I'm not convinced that's good or worth it. TFO solves the right problem in the wrong place IMHO.",1327445129

3507281,comment,3506345,3506345,76,0,jerf,,,"So, over the years I've played with many things that claim to be ""declarative"", and here's why I now shy away from them like the plague. There's no such thing as ""declarative"". No matter what you type into the computer, at some point it's going to turn into instructions that do the thing you want done. Trying to create a declarative language is a way of making it <i>extraordinarily</i> opaque as to what the machine is actually going to do. It looks great in four lines, it crashes and burn on any real sized problem, because you inevitably hit the following sequence:<p>1. I encounter a problem; a performance issue or a bug.<p>2. I can not practically proceed past this point because everything I might need to figure out what is going on has been ""helpfully"" obscured from me.<p>Yes, you can still thrash and flail but this hardly constitutes a ""fix"" to programming. You simply can not help but create an abstraction that not only leaks like a sieve, but is actually multiple leaky sieves layered on top of each other in opaque ways. (And letting us see in is in its own way a failure case too, with these goals.)<p>Part of what I like about Haskell is that it helps bridge the gap, but doesn't actually go too far. A map call is still ultimately an instruction to the machine. It's not quite the same type of instruction you give in C or C++, what with it being deferred until called for (lazy) etc, but it's still an instruction and it can be followed down to the machine if you really need to without only marginally more work than any other ""normal"" language. (It may be a bit bizarre to follow it down all the way, but hardly more so than C++ in its own way.)<p>Contrast this to SQL, which is declarative, and you never have to worry about what the database is doing to answer your question. Except it never works that way and you <i>inevitably must</i> actually sit there and learn how indexes work and how queries are parsed and how the optimizer works to a fairly deep level and then sit there on every interesting query and work out which synonymous query will tickle the optimizer into working properly except that you actually can't do that and you end up having to turn to weird annotated comments in the query specific to your database and then you still end up having to break the query into three pieces and manually gluing them together in the client code.<p>And I don't even care to guess how many man-millenia have been poured into that declarative language trying to make it go zoom on a subproblem <i>much</i> simpler than general purpose computing. (Well, except isasmuch as they've more or less grown to encompass that over the years, but it's still at least meant to be a query language.)<p>So, if you think you can fix that problem, have fun and I wish you the very best of luck, no sarcasm. This is the problem I've seen with the previous attempts to go down this route before, and I feed this back in the spirit of helping you refine your thoughts rather than yelling at you to stop.",1327444782

So the book said - whatever is in the next 200 pages is considered trivial by mathematicians working in number theory. If you write it in the form of equations, this entire book will occupy less than half a page. It is basically a lemma and a few theorems. But this book is 200 pages long. Why ? Because it tells you how to implement that lemma and those theorems using C++.<p>So that's how that is.<p>Just yesterday I described to an intern how to generate the nth term of a Halton sequence in base k. So if you want the 17th term in base 3, well, decimal 17 = ternary 122, reflect 122 to get 221, then ternary 0.221 = decimal 0.926. So the answer is 0.926. Its very, very simple. High school math. The nth halton term is in fact given by a 1-line equation in mathematics.<p>Now he came back with scala code to do the same thing.\nLook at this monster:<p>def Halton( n:Int, b:Int):Seq[Double] = {(1 to n).map( x=>Integer.toString(x,b).reverse.zipWithIndex.map(y=>(y._1-'0')*pow(b, -(y._2+1))).sum)}<p>Now it works & its functional programming & computes a million Halton terms in any base in 5 seconds and so on, but still, look at it. Is it anywhere close to the one line equation ? If I express what I want declaratively, will it be any simpler ? Not really. Why not ? Because a declaration like ""1..n"" means an imperative loop, a declaration like ""convert 17 in decimal to ternary"" means a whole bunch of divisons and remainders and aggregation, then a reflect means reversing a string, which implicitly means iterating over a character array and allocating new space for the reversed result, then a reconvert ternary to decimal means an iteration with powers of 10, where a power means other iteration over multiplication....jesus! This simple 1-line equation in math becomes hundreds of thousands of loops in practice. There's no getting around that. If you've gotten around it, you've just invented math!",1327444486

Especially when you open up a brand new app or one you are not using frequently it can be frustrating to get your bearings. I can, for example, never remember where I can lock or group objects (Im not even sure whether those commands are usually in a consistent place), the search is a good way to find out whether that functionality is available and where I can find it, also for future reference. Scanning menus for a specific command when I have no idea where it is is very frustrating for me.<p>This wouldnt really work if every app had to implement this feature on its own, probably in different places and with slightly different behavior. Even if the behavior were consistent you still could never be sure whether you can search in the first place, that uncertainty is in my experience a good way to make sure a feature will never get used.<p>This seems like a great OS level feature.",1327444373

You can add ads, you can do additional products, you can add a kind of clunky single-signon, whatever. Because at the end of the day, the user <i>needs</i> the thing you have that no one else does.<p>Now, Google had this. But one day, maybe around 2009, something happened. Where once I was delighted with Google's search, it started getting annoying. Things like automatically showing you a SERP for a different spelling of your query, because Google thought you were looking for that. Then they started matching to synonyms (tear and rip, say). And so this tool that used to do exactly what it was asked became too clever by half.<p>Meanwhile, SERP quality began to deteriorate as well. We suffered for something like 18 months under the regime of those Stack Overflow scrapers and their ilk, with plenty of equivalent nonsense in other verticals (hello, ebooks!).<p>So, already, Google took its eye off the ball for the one thing that previously had been inviolable. And now there's the comically titled SPYW.<p>Google's not stupid: they get that the rise of mobile and specialty apps/services that go with it are going to whittle away at the searches they'll be asked to do.<p>They've bet the company on Android and Google+ giving them an out. Android was a good call, as it puts them in the driver's seat for a lot of this mobile action. But they need the web, too. Can they get away with compromising their search with this nouveau portal strategy?<p>My hunch is that they're going to pay dearly in the process of finding out the answer is no. They're too big and too smart not to make the transition to whatever the next big thing is after search.<p>But boy screwing with the golden goose that earns both reputation and cash?<p>Well, give 'em this: they're willing to take risks.",1327443498

3507173,comment,3505803,3506364,11,0,shrub,,,"I worked for a company contracted to do Comcast customer service, so I've got some insight into what goes on on the other side of the phone. Mostly 250+ people in half-cubical rows telling subscribers (subs) to ""power cycle"" the modem; meanwhile team leads are pressuring the Customer Care Executives (CAEs) to get their call times under 5 minutes (literally 630 seconds, actually) and to stop ""escalating"" calls at all costs.<p>When I first worked there, training was 3 weeks. For a lot of new hires, 3 weeks is just not enough time to learn how to use a computer, how the internet works, and what the Comcast service offerings are in each area. Sure, they could pass the wussy multiple-choice ""progress evaluations"", but that's a far cry from having a workable knowledge of computers, internet infrastructure, etc.. A lot of them barely knew how to look something up in the knowledge base (internal website), and when they did find something, it was likely to be horribly out of date.<p>When I first graduated to ""the floor"" from training (and for a long time after), I kept all my class notes in a tabulated binder and referred to it often. This was entirely optional, and a lot of less capable classmates came with nothing but their password sheets. I bet Comcast spent an awful lot on technician visits because of CAEs who didn't know how to release/renew an IP address and subs who refused to pay $50 when the person on the phone had assured them it was not their computer's fault, thus the visit was free.<p>Eventually someone decided they could make up for general incompetence by introducing software that enforced a specific trouble-shooting procedure. They hoped that questions like ""Is the customer's TV working? yes/no"" would save time for the CAEs who always insisted it was antivirus causing the problem, whether or not the sub reported a poll down across the street; and questions like ""Is the customer's computer turned on (yes/no)"" would help the CAEs who insisted it was always a Comcast outage requiring a special technician escalation, regardless of the sub having reported no lights on the computer in addition to no lights on the modem. It's a great idea in theory, except in practice the software was buggy (""I'm sorry, can I put you on hold for 2 minutes? My trouble shooting software just crashed...""), sometimes lead in circles (""Can I get you to check... wait, no. We already did that. What the...""), and when it finally went full-scale and started accumulating hundreds of thousands of tickets, it became slower than slow (""Sorry, I'm just waiting for the next step to come up.""). Since the policy for a while was that every call absolutely required a TTS ticket number (only retrieved upon ""completing"" a line of questioning), we actually had times when we'd say ""I'm sorry I can't help you right now, we're having a tool outage,"" and there were many times I'd just click the shortest path to a ticket number because the system's bias was that the both the customer and the CAE were idiots; it was never the fault of, say, ancient terrible infrastructure that was falling apart.<p>The process of escalating a call in that center, by the way, was to put the customer on hold, stand up and wave your hand in the air. You'd then hope that someone would notice you before you lost all feeling in your arm. If someone did happen to see you (before ""ops"" called your phone to chide you on your excessive hold time), they'd ask what the situation was and would then usually refuse to take the call. ""I'm going to say the same thing as you told them, deal with it."" So the CAE has two options, drop the call and get fired or repeat that to the customer. Eventually we'd try to avoid having call time impacted by waiting for a ""manager"" to refuse to help anyways. For one particularly bad shift I worked out a deal with the guy sitting next to me: I just passed him my headset. He didn't even have to lie and say he was a manager, just the change of voice turned the trick.<p>When I left they had shortened training to 2 weeks. The last guy I partnered with for his last day of training (live calls) could not tell the modem from the router (I got the impression he wasn't sure what a router was, actually).<p>The whole thing was terrible for customers and for people who actually wanted to help customers.",1327443453

For example, deciding if an input piece of code will loop indefinitely.<p>In your article, you've mixed needless overhead (the dummy/local swapped variable comes to mind) and the steps needed to specify an algorithm.<p>If you only want to remove the overhead (and thus, some source of mistakes you've pointed out), you could aim for a language where the algorithms are easier to specify.<p>In the bubble sort case, the code would look something like.<p><pre><code>  def bubble_sort( array ):\n  	while there is an i such that array[i]<array[i+1]:\n  		swap( array[i], array[i+1] )\n</code></pre>\n(You can almost do this in Python already which seems to be where the syntax is inspired from.

I consider myself a generalist doing both design and programming but I don't have any formal training in the art of design. So yeah, it will seem foreign to me when someone starts speaking about white space, color theory, and all that.<p>What I'm talking about is the fact that anyone with little effort at all can code some HTML and CSS because they're far more forgiving. The results may come out like crap but most people (myself included) don't know good design anyway and so they end up calling themselves web designers based on some simple HTML tutorial. Getting a programming language to print out text is one thing but ask someone to do something useful. Nobody picks up a book on Ruby and builds a blog on the first try. Even the 20 minute blog tutorial is too high a barrier to entry for people without programming experience.<p>""Design"" languages like HTML and CSS are more about memorization. Memorize the tags and syntax and you can start building and publishing crap in a few days. Programming is different. Not only do you have to memorize the syntax but you also have to apply some logic to it as well. Programming is about problem solving whereas design is about describing output. Even the examples you'll find in books don't help unless you're trying to build the exact thing as the examples otherwise you have to actually understand the underlying concepts to get a program that suits your specific needs.<p>Neither one is easier than the other, I will not say that. First off, it's far easier for the unqualified to call the,slaves designers than programmer. But just because it's easier to enter the design realm doesn't make it easy. Once you have a grasp of both programming and design you'll find out that both are quite complex and interconnected. Those ""designers"" that haven't discovered that yet are the ones I'm talking about and they're the ones I'm basing my premise of design having a lower barrier to entry on.",1327442647

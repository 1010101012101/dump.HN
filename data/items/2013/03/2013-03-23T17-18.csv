Everyone is carrying their weight, so this is not a problem, but depending on a situation, individuals are finding themselves working through weekends, mainly due to their own volition and the fact that we're pretty thrilled about what we're doing. For some of us, facts of personal life simply do not allow this.<p>We've agreed on equal salary among the founders, but there's a growing suspicion that we should compensate for the uneven hours somehow, and we're exploring different options for that.<p>Does the HN community have positive/negative precedents on how to handle uneven hours among founders? An easy way out would be to start compensating for overtime in salary; however, this brings along issues like time tracking, which we're a little uneasy with.<p>Personally, I have been wondering if a more results-based approach would be more appropriate; after all, in these times I would encourage us to work smart rather than to work hard.

For example, showing you blog responses from across the web to a post you are reading. I think Google didn't show it because they have an aversion to exposing the incoming links graph for whatever reason, but this would be a killer feature for users.<p>Reader did have an excellent ""recommended"" feature that used some kind of social metrics algorithm. That feature stopped being useful after the G+ debacle, but it could also be a killer feature. I'm sure there are many others.",1364058133

As long as the content producers use other means than G+ to publicize their content I, as a consumer, have no incentive to use G+. So to me this still seems to be a losing proposition. Consumers vastly outnumber consumers and when the producers act as consumers they are still free to use whatever they want.",1364058044

In the case of Docs, the state for online editing and collaboration is deeply integrated with the browser, and doesn't have an analog in external formats. So, those features just aren't supported if you're not using native Google Docs, because the underlying support doesn't exist in other formats. And if you are using native Google docs, then the only way to get the document in another format is to export it.<p>Accepting all that, I still don't understand the claim that the document isn't synced.",1364058009

And he's obviously right about the odds: what percentage of YC companies have flipped?",1208641499

168156,comment,168127,168127,0,0,kyro,,,"I don't think his speech was that great. Loud and arrogant doesn't make for a great speech. He kept stressing the ease of settling for the middle and just asking people to pay for your services. He used the analogy of us paying for cars but I think there's one huge difference. There is a huge barrier of entry into the car business which ultimately results in us having to pay what we pay, but I'm the web world, your product can be copied on the fly, look begged and be free, and that's why people want to horde the masses, something he criticized, so they can offer a free service and yet monetize  using advertisements.<p>It happened with his product, the launch of huddlechat, but that as you know was taken down.",1208641221

His own empire, in his lifetime.<p>Tycoons of today have build their own empires (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Oracle etc.), same principle, same philosophy.<p>When and why did it happen that flippers took over this market's mindshare? A young entrepreneur today dreams of selling out to Yahoo/Google/Microsoft as soon as possible. Quite often even before his business is profitable.<p>Hey, if you have a growing business that is profitable, you should keep it for yourself. Many people with money I know (so-called 'professional investors') dream of having such a business in their possession. Such business is not listed, so you cannot buy it on the market. What you can buy on the market (what is listed) normally grows slower and is over-researched and over-valued.<p>But of course, if you focus on building the cash flow for yourself, and keeping the option of striking it very big at some time in the future for yourself, then the whole industry of undervalued option-buyers (VCs, angels etc.) will be left without work. So the propaganda is put to work... When is my next funding round?.. A round of what? When is your next client subscribing to your app - that should be the question.<p>DHH thrives on being controversial, but the point he makes here is simply a well forgotten truth about entrepreneurship. Building your business slow and taking full credit for it for yourself used to be the norm before the flipper ethics kicked-in.",1208641112

168147,comment,168144,168144,0,0,amrithk,,,"It depends. A few months ago, my current room-mate had an idea for a startup. We decided to move in together as it would be easier to brainstorm ideas, code, and plan what we needed to do. Both of us have full-time day-jobs and we work on week-nights and week-ends on our idea.<p>We have been pretty good so far in seperating work from our personal activities. We both make sacrifices to move our project forward. At the same time however, we don't interfere with each other's personal issues and activities. It takes some time to have a good arrangement and the best thing to do would be to communicate your expectations to the developer, and also listen to what he wants in terms of a working relationships. Lastly, I would recommend doing social things together with your developer. For example, you could have dinners with your developer and boyfriend. Such activities strengthen the working relationship and inspire everyone to continue working on the project.",1208639597

If anything goes south, you then have more than just a business that dies -- you have to deal with tenants, and there's likely additional legal ramifications as well.",1208639513

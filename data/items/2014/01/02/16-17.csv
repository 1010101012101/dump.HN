7000564,comment,6989971,6990155,1,0,djc14,,,"I agree with enraged_camel, but not for the straightforward reasons.  First, as a non-technical founder who recently learned (basic) coding skills, I can confirm his first and third claims - learning to program <i>does</i> make it easier to find developer support and it <i>will</i> greatly improve your appreciation for the technical aspects of the business.<p>However, most important should be the second claim since learning to code will help you build a crude MVP, allowing you to reach customers and validate your idea.  In this sense, enraged_camel and OP are both correct because they both point back to the same concept of reaching customers.<p>IMHO though, it comes down to what value a company is providing.  If it is a tech start-up where the software product is the main value-add, then a core competency must include programming.  If it is a real estate start-up with a website, then learning to code can probably be pushed off in favor of customer development.  So in the OP&#x27;s case, the question would be, are we in business to build a SaaS tool to help teams or are we satisfied helping team management improve  in any way possible?",1388681888

7000560,comment,6999567,7000471,2,0,aaronem,,,"It still seems like an ideal way to inculcate learned helplessness, though. (And I think there&#x27;s a reasonable argument to be made that getting beat up at his hands suggests you&#x27;re already pretty well &quot;on a bully&#x27;s bad side.&quot;)<p>I grew up in Mississippi. Firearms were pretty ubiquitous; especially as I got into high school, a lot of kids I went to school with were already experienced hunters -- you could always tell the first day of hunting season by the way your classes were suddenly half empty -- and it wasn&#x27;t all that uncommon for someone old enough to drive to school to have a rifle or a shotgun locked in his trunk. In spite of what might seem like a fertile environment for such enormities, no bully ever shot anyone.<p>But, to someone who&#x27;s familiar with the history of school shootings, this should not come as a surprise. Perhaps the first instance of the modern spate was Luke Woodham&#x27;s rampage in 1997, a case near and dear to my interest in the matter both for having happened while I was in high school and for having happened in my own home state. Woodham&#x27;s &quot;manifesto&quot;, as excerpted by Wikipedia, reads as follows:<p>> I am not insane, I am angry. I killed because people like me are mistreated every day. I did this to show society, push us and we will push back. ... All throughout my life, I was ridiculed, always beaten, always hated. Can you, society, truly blame me for what I do? Yes, you will. ... It was not a cry for attention, it was not a cry for help. It was a scream in sheer agony saying that if you can&#x27;t pry your eyes open, if I can&#x27;t do it through pacifism, if I can&#x27;t show you through the displaying of intelligence, then I will do it with a bullet.<p>This is, again, the first instance of a pattern all but ubiquitous among the type: it&#x27;s not bullies who kill, but rather their victims, who believe their actions to be their last resort in self-defense. Bullies have no reason to kill; they do what they do because it suits them, for whatever reason, to inflict pain, and you can&#x27;t do that to a corpse. Their victims, on the other hand, can reach a point where killing seems the only option available, not just to defend themselves from those specific people who beat them, but in a larger sense to reclaim their agency and their power of self-determination, and that&#x27;s the wellspring from which this sort of violence flows.",1388681868

This isn&#x27;t really about intelligence as much as it is about whether you have taken a course on probability. If you flipped 10 heads in a row the probability of the coin you have being the double heads coin increases dramatically, so you have to take that into account for the next flip. For intuitive understanding it often helps to go to extremes. Suppose you do 1 billion flips and all come up heads. What is the probability that the next flip comes up heads? Because we had 1 billion heads it is virtually certain that we are dealing with the double heads coin, so the probability that the next flip will come up heads is close to 1.",1388681743

The moral development of our species will be exactly proportional to our development of moral feelings, like empathy, and no faster.

Is that the entire point of having them in the movie?<p>>It implies that there&#x27;s something wrong with having a scene where two women discuss a man.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t. It says that is <i>all</i> women are for, is the male leads. Their sole purpose in film and life is and object for the males around them. They don&#x27;t have personality, they have men. They can of course talk about men, but they should talk about <i>other things too.</i><p>>It&#x27;s very narrow and to impose it on people is a violation of artistic license.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t. Nobody said all moves had to pass. It shows a societal trend that half don&#x27;t, that 50% of the population is female but many writers can&#x27;t figure out how to write women into their scripts in a meaningful way.<p>More data:<p><a href""http://www.seejane.org/research"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.seejane.org/research/</a><p><pre><code>    Males outnumber females 3 to 1 in family films. In contrast, females comprise just over 50% of the population in the United States. Even more staggering is the fact that this ratio, as seen in family films, is the same as it was in 1946.\n\n\n    Females are almost four times as likely as males to be shown in sexy attire. Further, females are nearly twice as likely as males to be shown with a diminutive waistline. Generally unrealistic figures are more likely to be seen on females than males.\n\n\n    Females are also underrepresented behind the camera. Across 1,565 content creators, only 7% of directors, 13% of writers, and 20% of producers are female. This translates to 4.8 males working behind-the-scenes to every one female.\n\n\n    From 2006 to 2009, not one female character was depicted in G-rated family films in the field of medical science, as a business leader, in law, or politics. In these films, 80.5% of all working characters are male and 19.5% are female, which is a contrast to real world statistics, where women comprise 50% of the workforce.\n\n\n    All facts are supported by research conducted by Dr. Stacy Smith, Ph.D. at the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism\n</code></pre>\nGender in Media: The Myths & Facts<p>MYTH: Boys and girls are equally represented in film and television.<p>FACT: Even among the top-grossing G-rated family films, girl characters are out numbered by boys three-to-one. That&#x27;s the same ratio that has existed since the end of World War II. For decades, male characters have dominated nearly three-quarters of speaking parts in children&#x27;s entertainment, and 83% of film and TV narrators are male. The Institute&#x27;s research indicates that in some group scenes, only 17% of the characters are female. These absences are unquestionably felt by audiences, and children learn to accept the stereotypes represented. What they see affects their attitudes toward male and female values in our society, and the tendency for repeated viewing results in negative gender stereotypes imprinting over and over.<p>MYTH: Family entertainment is a safe haven for female characters.<p>FACT: Astoundingly, even female characters in family films serve primarily as &quot;eye candy.&quot; Female characters continue to show dramatically more skin than their male counterparts, and feature extremely tiny waists and other exaggerated body characteristics. This hypersexualization and objectification of female characters leads to unrealistic body ideals in very young children, cementing and often reinforcing negative body images and perceptions during the formative years. Research shows that lookism still pervades cinematic content in very meaningful ways.<p>MYTH: Things are looking great for females behind the camera.<p>FACT: Females behind the camera fall far behind their male contemporaries and are at a distinct disadvantage in the entertainment industry. Only 7% of directors, 13% of writers, and 20% of producers are female. With such a dearth of female representation in front of and behind the camera, it&#x27;s a struggle to champion female stories and voices. The Institute&#x27;s research proves that female involvement in the creative process is imperative for creating greater gender balance before production even begins. There is a causal relationship between positive female portrayals and female content creators involved in production. In fact, when even one woman writer works on a film, there is a 10.4% difference in screen time for female characters. Sadly, men outnumber women in key production roles by nearly 5 to 1.<p>MYTH: Girls on screen compare favorably to their male counterparts.<p>FACT: Messages that devalue and diminish female characters are still rampant in family films. Gender stereotyping is an inherent problem in today&#x27;s entertainment landscape, and children are the most vulnerable recipients of depictions that send the message that girls are less valuable and capable than boys. The Institute&#x27;s research illustrates that female characters who are lucky enough to garner speaking roles tend to be highly stereotyped. From 2006 to 2009 not one female character was depicted in G-rated family films in the field of medical science, as a business leader, in the law, or in politics. 80.5% of all working characters are male and 19.5% are female, which is a contrast to real-world statistics of women comprising 50% of the workforce. With repeated viewings, young audiences may fail to realize this lopsided view is not, in fact, reality and believe there is no need for gender parity or industry change. Today&#x27;s children will be our future business leaders, content creators and parents and the ones who need to lead the charge for future generations.<p>MYTH: Gender imbalance issues have gotten better over time.<p>FACT: Statistically, there has been little forward movement for girls in media in six decades. For nearly 60 years, gender inequality on screen has remained largely unchanged and unchecked. Without an educational voice and force for change, this level of imbalance is likely to stay the same or worsen. Only through education, research, and advocacy both from within the studio system and entertainment industry, and with parents and kids, can we effect real change in this heavily gender-biased media landscape.<p><a href""http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Students/elb9501.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Students/elb9501.html</a><p>Tannis McBeth Williams (1985) conducted a study in Canada to examine the impact of television on a community which had previously had no television reception. She tested the sex role attitudes of a number of children who lived in a community where they had no television reception shortly before television was introduced to the community, and again two years after. He found that children in a community where there already was television were more sex stereotyped than the children in the community who had no television reception, and also found that those who had been introduced to television were, two years later, significantly more stereotyped in their attitudes towards the sexes than they had been before. This type of evidence suggests that, &quot;in the long term, television has the potential to shape children&#x27;s sex-role attitudes.&quot; (Gunter and McAleer, 1990, page 64).<p>and finally, an antidote:<p><a href""http://thehathorlegacy.com/why-film-schools-teach-screenwriters-not-to-pass-the-bechdel-test"" rel""nofollo"">http://thehathorlegacy.com/why-film-schools-teach-screenwrit...</a><p>Only to learn there was still something wrong with my writing, something unanticipated by my professors.

Some of them <i>will</i> press the button. It&#x27;s a matter of statistics and the moral framework of the other robots doesn&#x27;t even enter into the equation. That&#x27;s exactly the situation we&#x27;re in.<p>Moral progress has <i>always</i> trailed behind our capabilities, and if I may say something heretical here, maybe it&#x27;s also been <i>driven</i> by technological progress.<p>From the moment on where the first knife was used to attack a fellow human being, our capability to do harm has always been greater than our moral inhibition to do so. And it still is like this, by the way, with the humble knife. It seems we&#x27;ve never mastered the art of handling it responsibly, people are still being stabbed to death.<p>However, I think it&#x27;s also important to point out that we&#x27;re dealing with outliers. Knife murder is not something a person typically does during the average day, nor is it being a bomber, or a Bond-type villain researching world-ending microbes. At the same time though it&#x27;s important to recognize that the potential of these outliers to do harm to large numbers of people is only going to grow. Concocting the next deadly plague that might kill millions is now within the grasp of determined single crazy people. It&#x27;s kind of astonishing how little the media has caught on to this profound game changer that has been decades in the making.<p>We live in an age where a single person could very well wage war against a huge group of (possibly defenseless) people. That&#x27;s why the morality argument here is so weak: even supposing an ethically perfect society, we&#x27;ll never have the statistical certainty to exclude destructive outliers.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution for this dilemma, of course, but it&#x27;s not as &quot;simple&quot; as merely complaining about the slow pace of our collective morality; or, more insidiously, calling for technological regression as a measure to uphold the common good. The growing disproportional power individual crazy people are wielding makes a reasonably good explanation for the causes behind the Fermi paradox, so I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get past this any time soon - at least not until reasonable technological protection is available that doesn&#x27;t at the same time enslave the civilization it&#x27;s supposed to protect.<p>In closing, I think there&#x27;s hope. The cold war was a first testing ground for the whole effect, and the fate of the world rested repeatedly on the moral actions of individuals. I&#x27;m still somewhat incredulous that it all worked out in the end. By the same token, even though inflicting mass casualties is now definitely within the reach of single people, there&#x27;s a distinct absence of world-ending catastrophes, and more importantly: there&#x27;s even an absence of people who actually tried to do it.<p>We might be OK, we might not. But it&#x27;s not down to large-group morality somehow playing catch-up with technology. The call to artificially inhibit technology &quot;until we&#x27;re ready&quot; seems a downright unethical proposition to me. It could be many, many generations until things like religious delusions finally die out, but you can be absolutely certain that will <i>never</i> happen in a world that is artificially tech-restricted. I thoroughly believe the only way forward is, you know, <i>the way forward</i>.",1388681306

Windows NT didn&#x27;t support Unicode until 4.0, released in 1996. NeXTSTEP may have been released in &#x27;89, but Unicode itself wasn&#x27;t finished until &#x27;91, it couldn&#x27;t possibly have supported Unicode upon release. The original releases of NeXTSTEP just used C strings; it wasn&#x27;t until OpenStep in 1994 that they introduced NSString based on UCS-2.<p>UTF-8 was publicly released in January 1993. So by the time these projects became Unicode enabled, UTF-8 had already existed for at least a year.<p>Java and JavaScript had no underlying platform constraints to choose UCS-2/UTF-16, since the underlying platforms didn&#x27;t support Unicode during their development.<p>Qt 2.0 was the first release of Qt to introduce Unicode support in QString, and it was released in 1999.<p>No, the real problem was just the fundamental design mistake that the Unicode consortium made when first developing Unicode. They thought that 16 bits would be enough to fit all of the world&#x27;s actively used writing systems, and the simplest way to support an extended character set would be to just switch the underlying character type from 8 bit integers to 16 bit integers. This was a mistake in many ways; 16 bits is not sufficient, especially when CJK is taken into account, and so they had to do a lot of unification that wasn&#x27;t really appropriate and led to a lot of resistance to using Unicode from CJK users. Changing to 16 bit integers for the fundamental character type meant that every API had to be duplicated to provide a wide character version. Some APIs already had wide character support for legacy wide character sets, but differences in existing wide character support between NT (which used 16 bit wide characters) and many Unices (which used 32 bit wide characters) meant that writing portable code is quite difficult. Using 16 bit integers for an internal representation means that there&#x27;s a native endianness, but once you need to interchange data endianness becomes a big issue. And so on.<p>UTF-8 was the solution to many of these problems, and it was introduced before Unicode support had become widespread, but the idea that 16 bit types should be used for Unicode had already permeated people&#x27;s consciousness and likely early development efforts. It&#x27;s too bad that more people didn&#x27;t learn from Plan 9&#x27;s experience switching to UTF-8, which happened all the way back in 1992 (they switched Plan 9 to UTF-8 before publicly announcing it, which acted as a very good proof of concept).",1388680155

A GIL is used to protect the internal state of the interpreter.<p>You (or your standard library) need ruby-level locks in ruby code when you do things like increment a counter.  E.g.: &quot;obj.count = obj.count + 1&quot;.<p>The interpreter needs interpreter-level locks when doing things like looking up attributes from an object&#x27;s dictionary or hash table or whatever ruby calls it.  That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t always need a lock around a simple assignment to avoid interpreter crashes: &quot;obj.count = 0&quot; is safe.  Without a ruby-level lock around that, there is a race condition with the previous example, and resetting the count to zero may not have an effect if you&#x27;re unlucky.<p>Without a GIL, however, you could have problems like the interpreter segfaulting (instead of throwing a nice execption that you can handle).  You may also have problems like that assignment turning into an infinite loop, depending on ruby&#x27;s implementation of hash tables.<p>And if accessing a hash table isn&#x27;t safe, you can&#x27;t even use ruby-level locks.  How would you create a lock?  You&#x27;d need to access classes or functions in a module.  The module stores those things in a hash table, which you can&#x27;t access without a lock.

If you assume that views are written in a template language, which is the norm, then diffing is usually unnecessary.  I&#x27;d never heard of self-adjusting computation, but it sounds a lot like what Meteor does!  Thanks for the link.<p>All that said, I think React&#x27;s model is great, and performance is actually fine.  The React guys are not naive about browser performance; they&#x27;ve thought way harder about it (and tested more) than the commenters here seem to realize.  The diffing is performed in pure JavaScript and is very fast.  Creating a framework for declarative views in JavaScript is a pretty tough problem, and diffing is a major tool in the toolkit of ways to make it possible, the same way treating certain objects as immutable or storing JSON in your database are tools that enable certain styles of programming.<p>What pulled Meteor away from diffing as a central paradigm was the desire to stay closer to today&#x27;s web development techniques and make things simpler for the developer.  We wanted to provide the ultimate automagical version of templates and jQuery rather than something new you have to understand.  When you have templates, you don&#x27;t have to lean on diffing as much.  When you have jQuery in play, you make fewer assumptions about owning the DOM (in React, every DOM element is backed by a component).<p>In the long term, the jQuery part will fall away as declarative templates and components do the heavy lifting and the DOM is seen as less hostile (with IE8 retiring, for example).",1388680054

APIs, different programming languages, awesome developer experience are the things that make me excited!<p>One of my last projects is Uploadcare.com. I designed its API and feature set.

I wrote or managed writing, and maintained open source libraries for many programming languages and platforms, including iOS.<p>I have experience with Big Data. I solved many problems related to the storage and processing of huge amounts of data. I used Hadoop a lot, with Pig and by itself, mostly on Amazon EMR.<p>For my clients, I created different tools and worked on things related to large-scale deploys, big data storage and analysis, advanced monitoring of complicated systems, etc. I know Fabric and Chef very well.

My first choice was to take the BSD 4.4-Lite release and make a kernel. I knew the code, I knew how to do it. It is now perfectly obvious to me that this would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very different place today.<p>RMS wanted to work together with people from Berkeley on such an effort. Some of them were interested, but some seem to have been deliberately dragging their feet: and the reason now seems to be that they had the goal of spinning off BSDI. A GNU based on 4.4-Lite would undercut BSDI.<p>So RMS said to himself, &quot;Mach is a working kernel, 4.4-Lite is only partial, we will go with Mach.&quot; It was a decision which I strongly opposed.

($MY_CLAIMED_MORALITY stands in contrast to $MY_ACTION_MORALITY, i.e., how one behaves, which this essay <i>does</i> discuss there being a difference in, to its credit.) Fiddling with morality may have large potential benefits, but it can also cause catastrophe, yes, even worse than what we have now.<p>&quot;Increasing empathy&quot; sounds great, right? But it can cause excessively local decision making brought on by a particular case of acute pain, while missing the greater good that may be done elsewhere. It may allow a morality-parasite leader to come to power to manipulate everybody via their increased empathy to do something awful. (Indeed, I&#x27;m sure many people here have found that even in current society, there&#x27;s certain areas that you must deliberately reduce your empathy in; you simply can not afford to be manipulated by every picture of a starving child you come across, or you&#x27;ll become broke... and with no guarantee that your donations are doing anything but lining a pocket somewhere, if you&#x27;re too busy giving to do background checks on who you&#x27;re giving to....) And of course it&#x27;s not a knob; what &quot;increases empathy&quot; in the lab may in the field &quot;increase empathy <i>for my tribe</i>&quot;, as we are so wired for that.<p>Tribalism is bad, right? Perhaps so, but &quot;let&#x27;s just turn down the tribalism&quot; does not clearly work. We are tribal for a reason. Unless you can flip the switch all at once, you run the risk of the selfless a-tribals getting parasitized by the still-tribal, meaning it may not be stable. It may not be stable even if you <i>could</i> flip the switch all at once; you still have to worry about morality parasites.<p>To say nothing of what happens once you have the power to twiddle with human morality, and then those of altered morality start twiddling the knobs themselves, which would be inevitable.<p>Yes, it is likely that some morality changes will have to occur for human survival... no, it probably is not the case that you can predict them trivially now, no, it probably isn&#x27;t as simple as &quot;Why can&#x27;t we all just love each other?&quot;, and I very strongly suspect that if we could get a preview of that new morality, we&#x27;d all probably find it <i>repulsive</i> in some way... it&#x27;s simply inconceivable that the answer is as easy as taking somebody&#x27;s modern morality (which does not come from any magically better morality source, it&#x27;s as broken as everybody else&#x27;s) and stamping it out on everyone else.",1388679272

I would bet that the system you are writing this comment from is running thanks to the GNU software.<p>Second, it is debatable whether sticking to Hurd was a good or a bad idea <i>technically</i>. Imagine if Stallman and co. managed to convince a good number of developers that it was a good idea and the kernel was competitive with Linux, BSD&#x27;s, etc. If you believe you have a technically superior vision for your product, should you compromise on it just because people who do not share in your vision will not join you?<p>In the end, I think what killed the pure GNU/Hurd OS was bad PR and absolutism. Hurd as a technical question was just a small part of that. Remember, the debate between the Free and the Open Source guys was pretty fierce.

I wonder if anyone&#x27;s done something similar with beers?<p>Anyway a few &quot;next thing to try&quot; suggestions from a machine learning perspective:<p>The model selection process used here is by its own admission quite ad-hoc, based on a gut feel about diminishing returns. There are various more principled methods you can use to find the sweet spot between over- and under-fitting with these kind of models, a lot of them based on held-out validation data.<p>One way to do this would be leave-one-out cross validation (LOO-CV): hold out one whisky, fit the model, and see how &#x27;surprised&#x27; the model is by the held-out whisky, repeat for the next whisky and average over all the folds. Because the dataset is tiny this should be quite feasible.<p>To measure &#x27;surprisal&#x27; you could e.g. look at the distance from the held-out data point to the nearest cluster, although something better motivated would be if you switched to a probabilistic model and used likelihood of the held-out data. Probably the simplest next thing you could try in that direction would be a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) trained using EM. K-means is actually a degenerate limiting case of this.<p>A probabilistic model would also allow you to use Bayesian model selection criteria, which can get quite interesting (and might lead you eventually to things like Dirichlet process mixture models).<p>It would make it easier to compare the model&#x27;s explanatory power with other unsupervised probabilistic models. For example some kind of latent factor model like Factor analysis or pPCA would be quite interesting to investigate too, whether taken alone or in combination with clustering as a dimensionality reduction step as tlarkworthy is suggesting.<p>Also concur that doing multiple runs with different randomised initialization is generally a good idea for k-means or EM, since they can get stuck in poor local minima. Perhaps more common practise to pick the best of multiple runs  than to average them though.",1388678824

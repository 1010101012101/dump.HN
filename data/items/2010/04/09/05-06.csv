In the ""$10 million of VC investment"" scenario, lying about the multinational customer gives the entrepreneur more power than he otherwise would have had in the deal with the investor.

1252003,comment,1251552,1251552,0,0,Daishiman,,,"I find the premise of the article interesting, but much of his research seems to be bullshit. ""an energetic body capable of high mobility and peak energy bursts""? What the hell is this guy talking about? The peak energy burst of a human is absolutely puny in comparison to any other animal in the African savanna. The fastest sprinter and the strongest weightlifter would be torn to pieces in nature when paired up with modern predators or prey, and their increased caloric consumption would make maintaining their muscle mass too difficult a task.<p>I also take issue with his comments on aerobic training and running, since if there is one area where humans are far and away superior to practically all others is long-distance running, which maps properly to the hunting methods of early hunter-gatherers. Seriously, human beings can kill almost any land mammal by tiring them to death.<p>He also talks about the supposed health benefits observed in professional basketball and football players. Has this guy even SEEN these pro players after retirement? Most of them bulk up weight very quickly and many have substantial lesions from playing. It's a regimen that no one can maintain for more than a few peak years of performance without seriously screwing up your body for good. In contrast, I have met literally hundreds of runners, cyclists, swimmers and triathletes who can still succesfully compete beyond their 50s. Beyond early 30s fast-twitch muscle fiber performance goes down dramatically, but aerobic capacity and slow-twitch fiber keeps up, and for all intents and purposes we depend on slow-twitch muscles and a better lung and cardiac capacity much more than bulk muscle mass.<p>Finally, just because we consumed a certain diet as hunter-gatherers does not mean that it is the optimal diet, even if it was much better than what we had as early farmers. Nowadays domestic pets live far longer than they do in wild, among other reasons because pet food contains lots of nutrients those animals lack in all-meat diets.<p>Look, it's all fine and dandy with thinking about evolutionary processes, but you have to realize that evolution did not select us to reach old age, which means that it misses out on the sort of things we need to prevent aging.",1270792356

How does one prove the terms that they agreed on in the event of a conflict. Say you have a policy page that randomly changes versions on every visit. It could say either 'We (will|won't) share your email' each time it is loaded. What then? Which version of the document did you agree with.<p>2. Following the extra comma fiasco, where one company lost millions of dollars because a comma was added in the contract where it shouldn't have been. Why put something on the web which in essence...can only hurt you?<p>With no terms of service, you are free to do whatever you like (within reason/confines of the law) - adding an extra contract just makes you vulnerable since you are agreeing to things that maybe a great lawyer could find a hole in.<p>We don't have a ToS or Privacy Policy for those reasons, is that wrong?",1270790317

Why must I move my mouse across two monitors just use this app's menu?<p>> Personally, I still can’t stand how Windows and Linux make no distinction between applications and windows.<p>I can't stand how you can close all windows on a Mac and still have the process around with the only indication being a slightly difference in the menu bar.

6024947,comment,6023512,6024338,1,0,bane,,,"I think you are correct. This soon-to-be-past console generation was particularly protracted and I think that reflected in the PC gaming market.<p>The PS3 is 7 years old<p>The 360 is 8 years old<p>The Wii is 7 years old<p>Games written for these platforms and then ported to PCs (or written with cross portability in-mind) just aren&#x27;t stressing modern PCs at all. I built my system to be as-good as or better than any of those consoles and it&#x27;s more than kept up.<p>UberMouse (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6023957"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6023957</a>) mentions<p>&quot;For gaming that will change with the new console releases. The Xbox One is >4x more powerful than the Xbox 360 and the PS4 is >6x. It might take a few years, but the slump in increasing processing needs will probably die off.&quot;<p>Which is also true. Ports from those consoles will definitely urge me to get a better machine. Not only are the CPUs and GPUs better, but the games will be written assuming more RAM is in place.<p>glogla (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6024693"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6024693</a>) is also correct that dropping in an SSD would ramp up my system speed noticeably (my rMBP is twice the computer my desktop is without SSDs, with SSDs it chews it up and spits it out...it&#x27;s almost absurd using my desktop these days to be honest). At this point I&#x27;m also noticing that my primary computer use (web browsing) is eating up more and more memory. I&#x27;d also need more RAM, which in my case means a new motherboard, which implies new CPU etc. The truth is my machine is so old now that it&#x27;s kind of reached the point where I can&#x27;t really just upgrade 1 part, or add a bit more of this or that. And I definitely want my next system to have at least a 5 year lifespan.<p>Things I was waiting for:<p>- SSDs to drop below $1/GB @ 500GB or more sizes<p>- A selection of sub $150 motherboards to support 16-32GB of RAM<p>- Waiting for the CPU core wars to stabilize (It looks like we&#x27;re good there)<p>- Some of the AMD/ATI merger stuff to shake out. I was an old AMD fan, so I wanted to see what if anything they&#x27;d end up offering<p>- The PhysX, CUDA, whatever world to mature a bit and see how it all gets pushed down into consumer-level video cards<p>I think it&#x27;s time and I&#x27;m starting to price out parts and research stuff. But like I said, I&#x27;m not feeling any particular pressure to do it <i>today</i> and the beauty of technology is waiting a while just makes things cheaper.",1373529484

6024942,comment,6019312,6020328,1,0,primitur,,,"One thing that I think that is important to understand is that these machines, and this code, is still out there, working.  People are still playing these games (MAME) and the emulation scene that has arisen due to the fanboix fervour has really pushed a lot of the gems into the 21st century with new life and vigor.  The &quot;automatic game player&quot;-coded-in-z80, i.e. hardware playing hardware, is a real hoot!<p>And last but not least, consider this: people are still writing amazing software for the older architectures, using modern principles, and learning astonishing new things about the &quot;antique hardware&quot;, to boot!  In my particular nook I have witnessed the Oric-1/Atmos machines (<a href=""http://oric.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oric.org</a>), typically considered a fairly &quot;grotty&quot; 8bit machine of the 80&#x27;s, never enough decent software, died early .. yet now come to new life with the discovery of never-considered color-modes and graphics capabilities by some of the modern scenes very elite hackers, turning their eyes to the &quot;old&quot; machines and producing new hits!<p>I think a lesson in all of this is that the old machines still contain a lot of power.  The robotron code could probably be refactored into something else, easily enough, if there was some intention behind doing it.  There are a lot of 6809&#x27;s out there, still, presumably in landfill its true, but nevertheless one could do worse than to re-discover old machines in the modern era, were one to want to sharpen ones skills ..",1373529392

6024931,comment,6024383,6024864,5,0,repiret,,,"(In the US) for airplanes with a maximum gross weight over 12,500 lbs, you require a &quot;type rating&quot; on your license to fly the plane.  The type rating is for a specific make and model (type) of airplane.  So if you have an Airline Transport pilot certificate with a 777 type rating, you cannot legally fly a 757 (unless you have a 757 type rating)<p>This distinction shows up not just in the law.  I have many hours flying a Cessna 172, but when I recently bought a 182, some insurance quotes required as much as 10 hours of instruction, even though I could legally fly the 182 without any at all.<p>(Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t actually flown large airplanes or driven tractor trailers - someone more experienced is welcome correct what comes below)<p>Tractor trucks are all pretty similar.  Hydraulic power steering, air breaks, unsynchronized transmissions, one engine, 18 wheels.  They have similar stopping distance, similar handling around turns, and nearly identical controls.<p>Large planes on the other hand can have very different handling characteristics and controls.  Different approach speeds, different after-takeoff checklists, different emergency procedures.  Different navigation and autopilot systems. Fly-by-wire systems even change the basic relationship between control inputs and their effect on the plane.",1373529075

6024906,comment,6022677,6024272,2,0,keypusher,,,"I&#x27;ve played a lot of games, and when I lose a game of Dota it&#x27;s absolutely devastating but when I win a good/close game, I am absolutely euphoric, sometimes even into the next day.  I don&#x27;t think (most) people actually take the game very seriously, it just has to do with the mechanics involved.  First, it requires a high level of knowledge and focus.  There are constant macro and micro strategy decisions to be made and a high level of constant fine motor skills required.  Additionally, you are highly dependent on your teammates, as they are on you.  If one person on your team makes a big mistake, it can cost your team the game.  However, there is frequent opportunity to work with your teammates to set up great plays, which are extremely rewarding to pull off successfully.  The third important factor is the match structure.  Each game of LoL/Dota is a discrete thing with a small number of participants.  It is common in other multiplayer games today to have people coming in and out during a &quot;session&quot;.  For instance in first person shooters, perhaps you join a 32 player server that is halfway through a map, you play for 15 minutes and then the server changes maps.  New people join, some people leave.  In LoL/Dota, a game lasts 30-60 minutes and you are stuck with the 5v5 team for that game.  I think the extreme highs and lows are at least partially due to the above factors: the level of focus required, the intense team dependence, and the match structure.",1373528509

6024821,comment,6024285,6024751,9,0,haldujai,,,"Yes, parallelization is actually the currently accepted means of increasing throughput, you&#x27;ll see diagnostic devices with thousands of channels. The reason it isn&#x27;t appropriate here is because of the complexity, the design is easy, you make a radial pattern of inlets with the splits towards the middle so you can combine outlets of the same type. Construction is relatively easy as well.<p>The problem comes from the <i>number</i> of inlets. You can:<p>a) a common inlet to all of your channels, or\nb) independent inlet for each channel, or for several channels<p>a) might seem intuitive, the problem is limitations on channel width, the inlet would have to feed a single channel which would then split (they would split to the inlet channel from the paper), structural limitations of PDMS and manufacturing have maximum widths and heights in millimetres at best. Which would not be enough to achieve the throughput required. The original &#x27;master&#x27; inlet would probably have to be at least in the 10-20 cm range to achieve flow rates that could make this a household filter.<p>Even with another, stronger material, and perhaps manufacturing techniques I&#x27;m not aware of you still have limitations of pressure, their channels are very small in the paper (for a reason), pressure becomes a limiting factor to prevent their failure.<p>The problem with b is sheer complexity, you&#x27;re talking about 10 000 tubes and connectors and holes punched into a chip if you even do a 1 - 60 split. The chip with just the channels would be about the size of a tissue box, this wouldn&#x27;t be able to accomodate the channels so now you&#x27;re talking about something tens of metres x tens of metres. This is hugely cost prohibitive and the channels from connectors would have to be really long, really long channels need more pressure to drive the liquid requiring more energy which reduces the efficiency significantly.<p>The reason parallelizaton works in pharmaceutical / DNA testing applications is you&#x27;re going from microlitres of DNA/samples to nano, or picolitres in the channels, a single inlet can sufficiently provide that throughput (you&#x27;re talking 10 uL / hour perfusion rates)<p>Edit: TL;DR version: Construction constraints would make this have worse efficiency than reverse osmosis and cost a lot more to manufacture as well.",1373526100

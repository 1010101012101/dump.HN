And what changed?\nI want the answer to this question too!&quot;<p>A hypothesis (remember this is only a <i>hypothesis</i>):<p>What changed was that science and math became way less cooler in the (American) public perception between the 80s and the 2000s.<p>With the cold war and space race, scientists and engineers were supposed to be the people who took the US to the moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were, after all, engineers. The last flight to the moon was in 1972. The Voyagers were launced in 1977. Scientists, astronauts, and their like were cool, for a change. No one cared about who was winning college football when people were going to the moon and exploring the Solar System. My theory is that CS / Engineering got caught along in this wave and experienced strong female enrollment<p>Later, in the late 90s, and early 2000s, films like American Pie and whatnot came along, and solidified the appeal of the sports-playing jock, and making fun of the &quot;nerds&quot;. Suddenly, nerds were the weak, spotty kids who were buried in their math books, and girls did not want to be associated with them. Enter present day, with probably 10% of CS classes in good schools being composed of women (unless it&#x27;s MIT etc., which preferentially admits women to even the ratios, if I remember correctly)<p>To see the attitude change, just think of television programs. The scientist/astronaut Major Nelson in I Dream of Jeannie (1965-70) was portrayed as a strong, positive, and socially successful character. The scientists in Big Bang Theory are portrayed as a bunch of socially inept shut-ins who are <i>very</i> socially/romantically unsuccessful and are supposed to be pitied by the audience.",1402869582

And probably an immersion blender or at minimum a blender of some kind.<p>I&#x27;ve also done a variety of extractions.  Carotene butter (which I think you need for the soup above anyway).  This requires little more than a vegetable or herb with fat soluble flavors (like lots of carrot) and some butter and a saucepan.  And a juicer.  Maybe I&#x27;m a weirdo (oh, who am I kidding, I&#x27;m a weirdo) but I like carotene butter on ... everything.  Its like butter-ketchup, but tastier.<p>The recipes are not necessarily oriented around generating the maximum volume of food or quantity of food per unit of raw material input.  So it takes a lot of carrots to make a large batch of carotene butter.  So it does.  And its worth it.<p>A lot of it is ideas and techniques.  So the advice on homemade hamburgers was interesting and informative and I was able to successfully employ it.  But I didn&#x27;t &quot;git clone&quot; the recipe, I just kind of fixed up my technique.",1402869535

Pick a &quot;big ass&quot; problem where the\nfirst good or a much better solution will clearly be\na &#x27;must have&#x27;, not merely a &#x27;nice to have&#x27; and will\nbe very valuable, in the sense of making money, the\ngreen kind.  Note the &quot;clearly&quot;.  If pick a problem\nthat does not satisfy &quot;clearly&quot;, then try again.  I\ndidn&#x27;t say that the success would be easy to do.<p>Part of the reason VC has been &quot;digging in the wrong\nplace&quot; is that it tries to make money with small\nproblems, where the solution is just &#x27;nice to have&#x27;\ninstead of &#x27;must have&#x27;.<p>The ideal example of a &#x27;big ass&#x27; problem, although\nnot in information technology, would be a safe,\neffective, cheap one pill cure for any cancer.\n&quot;Breakthrough&quot;?  Yup. &quot;Crazy&quot;?  Sure; NIH has been\nthrowing billions a year at that.  But it would be a\n&#x27;must have&#x27;; no question about &#x27;product-market fit&#x27;.\nA &#x27;must have&#x27; doesn&#x27;t have any questions about\n&#x27;product-market fit&#x27;.  If looking at projects where\nthe results have some doubt about &#x27;must have&#x27; and\nlikely need to work on &#x27;product-market fit&#x27;, then\nare looking at the wrong projects, are &quot;digging in\nthe wrong place&quot;.<p>Another fad for teenage girls does not qualify as a\n&#x27;must have&#x27;.  Yes, such a fad might make a $1\nbillion, but it is too difficult to evaluate.\nInstead, I mentioned &quot;clearly&quot; be a &#x27;must have&#x27;.\nThat is, it is crucial to be able to get a good\nevaluation early on, and nearly never can do that\nwith fad products, as, indeed, the Andreessen\nremarks so clearly indicate.<p>(2) Solution.  Find the needed solution.  Often the\nsolution will not be easy to find, but this need not\nconcern VCs since they need look only at deals where\na solution has already been found.  If can&#x27;t find\nthe needed solution, then return to (1) and try\nagain.  A solution that is difficult to find can\ngive a technological barrier to entry.<p>Q.  Whatever you are working on, someone else\nhas already done that.<p>A. Let&#x27;s consider that:  Take all the people who have\ndone that.  Then, except for rare ties, there must\nhave been a first such person, and for them no one\nelse had already done that.  So, the claim is false.\nSorry &#x27;bout that.  Instead, there really are things\nthat are significantly and genuinely new.<p>Q.  Then someone else can just reproduce the solution.<p>A.  Some solutions are quite difficult to find, may\nbe based on original work and/or advanced\nprerequisites understood by only a few people,\nimplemented in software, secure inside a server\nfarm, and, thus, provide a technological barrier to\nentry.<p>(3) Prove that really have a solution as described.\nWhen have such a proof early on, usually it is just\non paper, especially for solutions in information\ntechnology.  Is this possible?  Yes, for nearly all\nof science and engineering on practical problems,\nit&#x27;s routine and standard.  It&#x27;s how we build a new\nairplane engine, a new airplane, a new rocket, a new\nsatellite, a new application of carbon fiber, etc.<p>(4) Evaluate the paper solution.  Can this be done?\nIn nearly all of applied science and engineering,\nsuch evaluations are standard and routine; it is\ninsisted that such evaluations be done.  No one puts\nup a new satellite with &#x27;agile&#x27; techniques\niteratively &#x27;searching for product-market fit&#x27;.\nThere&#x27;s no counting on &quot;magic&quot;.  Fads of teenage\ngirls are just irrelevant.<p>(5) Develop the solution.<p>(6) Deliver, sell the solution, the first good or\nmuch better &quot;must have&quot; solution.<p>Can these six steps be done?  Sure; history shows\nthat there&#x27;s no doubt.  Thankfully for US national\nsecurity, the best examples are funded and exploited\nby the US DoD.<p>A great example was the SR-71:  Problem:  Get\npictures of the USSR.  Solution:  An airplane that\ncan fly at Mach 3+ at 80,000+ feet for 2000+ miles\nwithout refueling.  Proposed essentially just on\npaper by Kelly Johnson and the Lockheed Skunk Works.\nThe project passed evaluation and went ahead as\nplanned.<p>Other examples:  GPS and the earlier version by the\nUS Navy -- proposed on the back of an envelop by\nsome physicists at the JHU/APL, A seafloor, passive\nsonar array.  The F-117 stealth plane; flew across\nSaddam&#x27;s anti-aircraft artillery without a scratch;\nanother Lockheed success.  The Keyhole satellite,\nthat is, a Hubble but aimed at earth.<p>Outside of the US DoD, the LHC; found the Higgs as\nplanned.  The WMAP satellite -- found the details in\nthe 3 degree K background radiation as planned and\ngot enough resolution to permit an estimate of the\nbig bang 13.7 billion or so years ago.<p>These projects were evaluated essentially just on\npaper and worked as planned.<p>Generally such science and engineering has a much\nbetter batting average than VC.  E.g., in each case,\nthe SR-71, GPS, the LHC, WMAP, there was a problem\nthat needed a &#x27;must have&#x27; solution, such a solution,\nevaluation just on paper, and success.  No &quot;magic&quot;.\nNo getting 3000 projects, looking carefully at 200,\npicking 20, and having 10 fail.<p>What should VC do?  Sure:  Stop &quot;digging in the\nwrong place&quot; and, instead, follow steps (1) - (6).<p>Will VCs get many such project proposals?  Well,\nlikely now they get more than they are willing or\nable to evaluate, but with interest in and success\nwith such projects, they stand to get more such\nproposals.  Considering how few VC projects pay off\nnow, VCs don&#x27;t need to get more than a few dozen\ngood proposals each year.  Digging in the right\nplace doesn&#x27;t require moving much dirt to get to a\nlot of gold.",1402869270

7896467,comment,7895364,7895733,12,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>&quot;You have to be greedy to go into Wall Street banking in the first place.&quot;</i><p>Not necessarily. Our society places tremendous pressure on us to be materially successful. A lot of highly ambitious people in high school, and later in college, hear that Wall Street is the best way to become materially successful. So they go to Wall Street. Once they&#x27;re hooked into the Wall Street lifestyle, mainlining money, they have a hard time giving up the habit. And they&#x27;re start to justify an increasingly slippery array of behaviors to maintain their fix.<p>No doubt there&#x27;s a proportion of all incoming, freshman analysts who are there because they&#x27;re greedy. It&#x27;s all about money for them. Gordon Gekko is a hero, not an antagonist. Wolf of Wall Street looks like a celebration, not a cautionary tale. Etc. But I&#x27;d bet that, for every Junior Gekko, there are two or three smart, ambitious, by-the-book kids who are following the recipe their parents, their educators, and their mentors have told them to follow.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re one of those kids. You land a prestigious job at a bulge-bracket firm. You&#x27;re making gobs of money. That&#x27;s hard to give up. Especially because you&#x27;ve worked so hard, for so long, to get to where you are. So you keep climbing the ladder. As you climb, you make more money. You don&#x27;t want to give that up, either. Maybe you experience a few shady or ethically questionable things along the way, but hell, you&#x27;re making a shitload of cash. And deep down, you suspect that there&#x27;s no functional, ethical difference between you and some middle manager at a Main Street company; the only difference is that you&#x27;re doing more &quot;sophisticated&quot; work, and you&#x27;re getting paid a lot more. The lifestyle sucks, but you&#x27;ve been conditioned to expect that having a life is a sucker&#x27;s bet. You&#x27;ve traded all of that for the definition of success you&#x27;ve come to internalize.<p>The failure here isn&#x27;t wholly the individual&#x27;s. It&#x27;s also the system&#x27;s. Our society, our culture, our <i>system</i> teach many of our best and brightest to treat money and prestige as life&#x27;s scorecards.<p>I don&#x27;t excuse shady behavior from banks or from bankers. But I don&#x27;t think most bankers are morally defective human beings. I think they&#x27;re Type-A kids who do what they&#x27;re told. Hannah Arendt wrote about the banality of evil; I think one could write just as convincingly about the banality of greed. Or the institutionalization of greed. No doubt there are some genuine sociopaths on Wall Street, and perhaps in greater proportion than you&#x27;d find in other industries. But for every sociopath, you have some folks just chasing what society conditions them to chase.",1402869217

The crucial supporting\nbackground is just rock solid, so far essentially\nmissed by VC but among the most solid in all of\ncivilization -- no joke.  That VC is missing out is\njust absurd.<p>The OP is yet another effort at &#x27;understanding&#x27;\nventure capital investing.  There&#x27;s something\nstrange here:  At<p><a href=""http://avc.com/2013/02/venture-capital-returns/#disqus_thread"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avc.com/2013/02/venture-capital-returns/#disqus_threa...</a><p>that is, VC Fred Wilson&#x27;s blog, is some data that\nshows that on average in the US, information\ntechnology venture capital returns in one word suck,\nthat is, are really poor, bad, low, etc.<p>So, in trying to understand how venture capital\ninvesting works, at least on average we are trying\nto understand something that works poorly.<p>Below I explain how to do much better, but broadly\nthat VCs struggle so much, as is clear in the OP, is\nfrom incongruous to absurd.<p>The OP is awash in some really bad news that shows\nthat the VCs admit that, really, they don&#x27;t much\nknow what the heck they are doing and, instead, are\nreading tea leaves and then shooting in the dark;\nsuch nonsense is unnecessary.<p>Let&#x27;s consider some quotes from the OP:<p>&quot;even the top VCs write off half their deals.&quot;<p>Dumb.  Each year a VC gets 3000 deals, looks\ncarefully at maybe 200, invests in maybe 20, and 10\nflop.  Clearly something&#x27;s seriously wrong here.<p>&quot;And of course, you make all your money on\nsuccessful and non-consensus.&quot;<p>That the good deals should be so difficult to\nevaluate that there should be no &quot;consensus&quot; is\nabsurd.  Sure, detecting the next SnapChat is\ndifficult, but largely we should set aside such\ndeals -- based on, what, starting a fad of teenage\ngirls having fun being &#x27;improper&#x27;.  Instead it is\npossible to have plenty of deals that are fairly\neasy to evaluate.<p>&quot;And let me translate ‘non-consensus’: in sort of\npractical terms, it translates to crazy.  You are\ninvesting in things that look like they are just\nnuts.”<p>E.g., another SnapChat is that way, and that&#x27;s why a\nVC should not take seriously such deals.  E.g.,\nsomeone comes out with a better version of the same\nbasic idea, but maybe SnapChat is hurt by their\ninstalled base that becomes dragging a big anchor to\nresponding.<p>But there are much better deals than SnapChat where\nnothing looks &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;nuts&quot;. Putting up with\ndeals that are crazy or nuts is, well, crazy and\nnuts.<p>“The entire art of venture capital in our view is\nthe big breakthrough for ideas.  The nature of the\nbig idea is that they are not that predictable.”<p>Yes, “The entire art ... is the big breakthrough for\nideas&quot;; the problem is that, flatly, VC (1) is\nworking with &quot;ideas&quot;, e.g., SnapChat, that are based\non fads, etc. and, thus, are essentially impossible\nto evaluate and (2) VC doesn&#x27;t understand what\nreally good, &quot;big breakthrough ... ideas&quot; are, where\nto find them, and how to evaluate them.  For the\ngood, big breakthrough ideas, accurate evaluation is\nquite doable, and there is little that is&#x27; not\n&quot;predictable”.  VC doesn&#x27;t understand (1) and (2),\nand I explain below.<p>“Most of the big breakthrough technologies/companies\nseem crazy at first:  PCs, the internet, Bitcoin,\nAirbnb, Uber, 140 characters..  It has to be a\nradical product.  It has to be something where, when\npeople look at it, at first they say, ‘I don’t get\nit, I don’t understand it.  I think it’s too weird, I\nthink it’s too unusual.’”<p>“Most of the big breakthrough technologies/companies\nseem crazy at first&quot; is only true because VC has\nbeen, to borrow from a movie, &quot;digging in the wrong\nplace&quot;.<p>“You want to have as much ‘prepared mind’ as you\npossibly can.  And learn as much as you can about as\nmany things, as much as you can.  You want to enter\nas close as you can to a zen-like blank slate of\nperfect humility at the beginning of the meeting\nsaying ‘teach me’….  We try really hard to be\neducated by the best entrepreneurs.”<p>Sorry, I have a serious background in how to\n&quot;learn&quot;, and my experience is that VCs are quite\npoor at it and need to &#x27;put on their game faces&#x27; and\n&#x27;up their game&#x27; several notches from some very good\nsources, and some popular Silicon Valley coffee or\nsandwich shop is NOT such a source.<p>“You want to tilt into the really radical ideas… but\nby their nature you can’t predict what they will\nbe.”  “There will be certain points of time when\neverything collides together and reaches critical\nmass around a new concept or a new thing that ends\nup being hugely relevant to a high percentage of\npeople or businesses.  But it’s really really hard\nto predict those.  I don’t believe anyone can.”<p>&quot;Really radical&quot; is fine, maybe often necessary,\nbut, of course, not nearly sufficient; but it is\njust crucial to have ideas that can be evaluated\naccurately and to do the evaluations.  For &quot;really\nreally hard to predict those&quot;, VCs are &quot;digging in\nthe wrong place&quot;.  Instead, with good &quot;breakthrough\nideas&quot;, &quot;really radical&quot;, provocative, shocking,\n&quot;crazy&quot;, &quot;nuts&quot; that can be evaluated and that have\na good evaluation, being able to &quot;predict&quot; is\nreally, really easy.<p>“We are looking for a magic combination of courage\nand genius&quot;<p>Looking for &quot;magic&quot;?  Looking for magic went out of\nstyle back in the &quot;Age of the Reason&quot;.  Looking for\nmagic is wandering and shooting in the dark.  As I\nexplain below, there is a way to find the light\nswitch, turn it on, and see what&#x27;s happening (thank\nyou A. Wiles).<p>“The thing all the venture firms have in common is\nthey did not invest in most of the great successful\ntechnology companies.”<p>There is a reason:  VC has concentrated on deals,\n&quot;digging in the wrong place&quot;, that are essentially\nimpossible to evaluate.  Instead, concentrate on\ndeals that can be evaluated and, then, evaluate\nthem.  What deals are those?  I explain below.<p>&quot;The challenge in the field is all of the great VCs\nover the last 50 years, the thing that they all have\nin common, is they all failed to invest in most of\nthe big winners.&quot;<p>Again, the VCs were &quot;digging in the wrong place&quot;.\nYes, even in that place sometimes there is some gold\nthere, but that doesn&#x27;t much help because the gold\nis in a form essentially impossible to recognize,\nthat is, evaluate.  So, dig in the right place where\ncan recognize, evaluate, the gold that is there.\nThe right place?  I explain below.<p>The theme of the Andreessen remarks is wandering and\nshooting in the dark.

7896459,comment,7895504,7896001,6,0,lxcid,,,"This is kinda misunderstanding Apple approach to introducing technology. Apple seldom introduce a technology as intermediary solution or discard them soon after. (the last time this happen that I could remember was GC in Objective-C which is replaced by ARC) They could double down on it even if it has its algorithmic flaws, and they will attempts to fix those flaws.<p>One of recent technologies that fall into this category is auto layout. (The performance of auto layout in iOS 7 for slightly more complex table view cells is pretty bad)<p>Apple main interests is always Apple, which makes sense because they are a for profit company. Just as Rails is always Basecamp. Apple technology have a fast paced development because Apple dog food their technology. WebKit in Safari, LLVM in Xcode. They invested huge in these area.

How comfortable are you with C/C++? How tolerant are you of buggy/constantly crashing software?<p>In 6 months time the answer will be Swift in my view. It is a better language and has nice strongly typed features to help make robust code.<p>However at the moment you have to put up with a buggy implementation and a development environment that is likely to crash every 30 minutes or so taking unsaved edits with it (this is not a complaint it is an Alpha/Beta release and the first release). It does make developing more of a chore. Plus the fact that the language may change itself in the coming months (and in places like the arrays I hope it does). Given all that I suggest waiting and doing something else in the meantime.<p>If you are familiar with C/C++ I would dive in with Obj-C and start getting to know the libraries you will need for your project and you can start adopting Swift when you are ready.<p>If you don&#x27;t currently program or are used to dynamically/duck typed languages like Ruby and Python I would try some stuff in something like Haskell, ML or another strongly typed language that will get you used to type theory and how to programme in that sort of strongly typed environment within a stable environment. I think that would make it easy to pick up Swift when it is a little more stable.<p>If you already have a good background in functional programming but not so much in C/C++ it might be worth braving the instability to use Swift to learn the Cocoa touch libraries and explore.

The collapse is continuing because even after an infinite time, as measured by a distant observer, the collapse is still not complete. Rather, the departure from a static configuration of Schwarzschild radius r=2m as seen by a distant observer diminishes exponentially in time, with a characteristic time of the order of 2m, or about 10 microseconds for an object of one solar mass. The box explains the purely geometrical system of units employed in general relativity. In this sense, the system is a “frozen star.”<p>In another sense, the system is not frozen at all. On the\ncontrary, the dimensions shrink to indefinitely small values in a finite and very short proper time for an observer moving with the collapsing matter (see figure 3). Moreover, a spherical system appears black from outside; no light can escape. Light shot at it falls in. A particle shot at it falls in.<p>A “meter stick” would be let down in vain to measure the dimensions of the object. The stick is pulled to pieces by tidal forces, and the broken-off pieces fall in without a trace. In these senses, the system is a black hole&quot;<p>So this seems to be an international term, and indeed both the Russian wikipedia <a href=""http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%B0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%...</a> and English-language one mention it.<p>Couple of other hits in search do mention that the term was used in 1960s - which probably explains the reason why it does sound a bit strange :-)<p>Anyway, it was fun to do this little investigation, thanks!",1402868788

This is how this problem is solved in C, and almost all other languages. It just looks deceptive because C&#x27;s native operators like &quot;<&quot; and &quot;>&quot; happen to be generic across some number types. This is just for convenience, it isn&#x27;t how C is meant to be programmed. Pretty much every other language also makes you define different implementations of functions when you have a different type you want it to work on. Lots let you type the same function name, independent of the type - via generics, interfaces, or type-classes - but all call out to different implementations at the end of the day. Very few can derive those implementations.<p>As far as I am concerned, Macros in C are best used just to save on typing.

I was clear in separating believing in discrete categories (both their objective existence and their usefulness), vs believing that symptoms can be treated.<p>>Labels do serve some use. But many people hate having the label and they hide it. Stigma is still very strong. For all the people who are open about their diagnosis there are many who keep it secret -- or who do not seek treatment because they are scared of the stigma.<p>You&#x27;ve ignored my argument regarding why people seek out labels, apart from their therapeutic usefulness.  I did also state that these labels have a stigma associated with them, but I made a claim, that you haven&#x27;t addressed, that the stigma of the symptoms in the absence of diagnosis, may be greater than the stigma of the label.<p>>Depression is not just sadness. Imagine your favourite show going off TV. You may be sad for a while. You probably won&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s your fault it&#x27;s come off air, nor that there is never going to be anything else worth watching, and the feelings won&#x27;t be constantly with you throughout the day and probably won&#x27;t last long.<p>It is this sort of claim, that I was asking for evidence for.  I agree that a person might feel all these things, and that it might be reasonable to label this cluster of symptoms as &quot;depression&quot;.  But you are taking it much much further, and claiming that this is in contrast to ordinary experience, and not an extreme part of a spectrum.  I can guarantee you one things: every person on earth has experienced much more significant sadness than their favorite TV show going off the air, and when they experience these things, the result is going to be much closer to the symptoms you associate with depression, than to &quot;being sad for a while&quot;.<p>>I find it vaguely offensive when people suggest that feeling bad enough to overcome the human inante desire for self-preservation is somehow a normal part of the human experience. A broken leg is not shameful, happens to many people, but is not normal.<p>If you are offended because you thought that I was implying that nothing should be done to help people who were in a state of mind that was so terrible to be in, that they preferred suicide, then you misread my post.  If you are offended because I didn&#x27;t draw a line in the sand separating such people from everyone else, because you find it offensive to the human spirit to suggest that, absent a very specific disease, a person would ever find themself in this state of mind, or anything resembling it, then I would answer that human nature is what it is, not what we want it to be.<p>>You also call cancer &quot;real&quot;. That kind of attitude (here&#x27;s a list of real illnesses, and here&#x27;s a list of psychological illnesses) is really harmful.<p>That is not what I said.  I never claimed that people should not seek help, or otherwise try to address the symptoms of mental illness.  What I said is that cancer is different from depression because cancer is a discrete category.  People don&#x27;t fall on a spectrum of having cancer, and whether or not a person has cancer is not at all subjective.",1402867310

They made it into the Haskell report 1.3 (&#x27;96)[2].<p>We should not be comparing the development of languages now to 20 years ago - there is an enormous amount we have learned, and these insights should be fundamental considerations when designing a new language. You can&#x27;t just &quot;tack&quot; things onto an existing language and expect it to be elegant - tacking on leads to huge languages like C++.<p>And yes, we should expect it as &quot;normal&quot; for new languages, because it is what people have come to expect to have available - although some implementations leave a lot to be desired.<p>If we consider how C# implements Functors for example, we see that it requires special language support, where the compiler essentially pattern matches over your code, looking for a method named &quot;Select&quot;, with a specific signature taking a generic type and a func. This implementation completely misses the point that Functors themselves, while useful, are not special - they are a specialization of a more general concept we have - typeclasses and higher-kinded polymorphism. C# also adds the ability to create Monads, Foldable, Comonads etc, using similar patterns - but you can&#x27;t create your own typeclasses, and are left to the language designers to add a desired feature.<p>The decision to add them onto C# like this was made not without knowledge of this, but out of consideration of working with the existing language, which <i>was</i> designed without their consideration, hence, why they&#x27;re a pretty ugly design compared to the simplicity of Haskell&#x27;s implementation.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150GIT/archive/mark-jones/fpca93.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150GIT/archive/mark-jones/fpca9...</a>\n[2]:<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/history.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a>",1402866318

When you instantiate a generic in a statically compiled language, that usually clones the body of the generic thing (method or type) with references to the generic parameters replaced with the type arguments; and the new, cloned body is handed off to codegen.<p>But if you instantiate via a protocol reference, the compiler doesn&#x27;t statically know the implementation of the thing you&#x27;re trying to call - it can&#x27;t see the body of code to clone. It&#x27;s an indirect function call through a variable, and without a restricted language, analyzing it quickly runs into the halting problem.<p>With runtime code generation, the problem can be solved with sufficient magic - the runtime can rewrite as necessary. That&#x27;s how .NET implements this.<p>Alternatively, if the body of each generic method is compiled using some form of dynamic dispatch - e.g. every operation on a value whose type is a generic parameter is done via an table of function pointers, and this table is passed into the generic method at the point of every call - then it can work, at some cost in speed. Haskell works like this, AIUI.<p>Java does it even more simply, with full-fat dynamic dispatch - all generic parameters turn into Object, and method bodies get runtime casts inserted as necessary.",1402866269

9832978,comment,9832825,9832949,0,0,skrebbel,,,"Flux is two things: a library by facebook (which you linked to), and a set of vaguely specified ideas. It&#x27;s the second definition this article (and most uses of the word &quot;flux&quot;) refer to.<p>Flux is an architecture pattern for applications where a lot of logic can run on the client. Its goal is to disconnect changes to state (the &quot;model&quot; in MVC terms) from the effect that should have on the view. This assumes that the view is a layer that can cheaply update itself without knowing what part of the state changes - a full &quot;re-render&quot; should be cheap and effective. React is a library that allows this.<p>Once the view can update itself without knowing what state changed, one side of the disconnect between state and UI has been solved. The other side is how to manage state when user actions change it.<p>When the model is a big blob of mutable data, this is easy: just update whatever you want to update, trigger a full re-render of the view and be done with it. But this has two disadvantages: first, it&#x27;s often difficult to serialize this model and send it over the wire, which means prerendering on the server for snappy startup times is difficult. Second, people often prefer the model layer to be built of immutable data, because that makes React re-rendering faster.<p>Flux tries to make working with serializable, immutable data easier by introducting what they call a &quot;unidirectional data flow&quot;: user actions go into a &quot;dispatcher&quot;, which in term knows which little sub-part of the model, called a Store, wants to turn that action into a data change. The stores, in turn, tell the view to re-render and that&#x27;s it. The view can query the stores but not change the data in them: that&#x27;s done only by sending actions through the dispatcher.<p>The core insight of Flux is that dealing with immutable data is pretty easy if you split the model up into a limited number of simple &quot;Stores&quot;, the granularity of which determines much of how well Flux works for you. If you manage to get them not too big and not too small, dealing with immutable data is not difficult anymore and React gets snappy updates. And serializing immutable data to JSON is pretty easy, because it&#x27;s guaranteed to be a tree, so prerendering both the HTML and the initial dataset on the server is a done deal.<p>Sorry, not 30 seconds. Does this help at all?<p>Personal commentary: I&#x27;m not convinced that Flux is the final solution. Before Flux was popular, I led a React team with a model layer that was plain old mutable JavaScript objects, and it worked remarkably well. It was a big cyclic graph of objects that all referred to one another. Typical oldschool OO data model design. The big disadvantage was that re-rendering was slower, but IMHO we need to find a better solution around that.<p>The guys who invented React said &quot;what? all that spaghetti code just to keep model and HTML in sync? i just want to rerender every time just like we used to do with PHP on the server! i&#x27;m going to find a workaround&quot; and invented the virtual DOM. In the same spirit, there <i>has</i> to be a way to make mutation of state simpler and still be fast and support universal (&quot;isomorphic&quot;) apps. Mutable state is rather unpopular these days, but if there&#x27;s <i>one</i> place where it shines, it&#x27;s UI development.",1436086704

It&#x27;s very shallow.<p>JS best practices are questionable at best. As an example, when React came out everyone was saying how much of a terrible idea it was (with me being one of those people, unfortunately), and how templates and code should be kept separate... But then I tried it, and I realized just how wrong I was. It makes a lot of sense to keep related things together. Your component&#x27;s logic / template can be in one place, and your <i>application</i> logic is kept elsewhere.<p>I read a lot about JS, and I get the impression a lot of people are just hacking together websites with JS sprinkled on top, or hackathon-style apps that they don&#x27;t plan on maintaining for longer that a few weeks. So their &quot;best practices&quot; end up being questionable at best. Basically, who are you to claim that whatever you&#x27;re doing is a &quot;best practice&quot;? It seems like a pretty bold claim, so I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect someone to back up their claims.<p>As a side-note, why don&#x27;t people ever talk about testing?

Pressure of air makes a real physical force (actually, pressure is defined as that total force divided by area). At the same time deflection downward, which implies an upward force, is correct but doesn&#x27;t show the mechanism how actually that implied force is born. It is born out of the difference of pressure between top of the screwdriver and the bottom - at the bottom you have more or less undisturbed ambient pressure, at the top the flow reduces the pressure.<p>What was interesting to me is Ben&#x27;s experiment with long enough cone which failed to get lift. Shouldn&#x27;t be so, I think. The problem could be that his air jet is relatively narrow - so with a long cone, which makes an angle with the stream not the whole cone gets flown over, and not the whole area is under the reduced pressure.

A high-intensity laser excites a physical matter to emit light at an arbitrary 3D position. Popular applications can then be explored especially since plasma induced by a femtosecond laser is safer than that generated by a nanosecond laser. There are two methods of rendering graphics with a femtosecond laser in air: Producing holograms using spatial light modulation technology, and scanning of a laser beam by a galvano mirror. The holograms and workspace of the system proposed here occupy a volume of up to 1 cm^3; however, this size is scalable depending on the optical devices and their setup. This paper provides details of the principles, system setup, and experimental evaluation, and discussions on scalability, design space, and applications of this system. We tested two laser sources: an adjustable (30-100 fs) laser which projects up to 1,000 pulses per second at energy up to 7 mJ per pulse, and a 269-fs laser which projects up to 200,000 pulses per second at an energy up to 50 uJ per pulse. We confirmed that the spatiotemporal resolution of volumetric displays, implemented with these laser sources, is 4,000 and 200,000 dots per second. Although we focus on laser-induced plasma in air, the discussion presented here is also applicable to other rendering principles such as fluorescence and microbubble in solid/liquid materials.&quot;<p>Full paper: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06668"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06668</a>",1436084466

XML 1.0 specs is 56 pages; by contrast, YAML 3.0 spec with similar formatting is 96 pages. And XML specs describes both the serialization format and simple grammar-based validation for the resulting high-level language (DTD); YAML only describes serialization.<p>XML is relatively verbose, but this is by design and is clearly stated as design goal #10: &quot;Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.&quot;<p>The grammar for XML serialization itself clearly has 1-character lookahead structure, so the parser must be deterministic and thus work in linear time. The tools that process XML (e.g. XML Schema, XPath or XSLT) are based on tree automata and, in most cases, work in linear time as well. (Of course, one can end up with a slow XSLT, I meet them all the time, but one can end up with a slow regex too.)<p>XML Schema provides very good types and a way to define your own types. I admit this part is relatively complex, but I think it&#x27;s inherent complexity. If you have a Schema-aware parser, you&#x27;ll get all the usual types (numbers, dates) and even more so, plus a better (more powerful) formal description of the high-level language than DTD. (For example, DTD requires all structures to have different names, while Schema can define context-aware types.) And Relax-NG is even more powerful. This extra description power doesn&#x27;t increase the runtime complexity though, it&#x27;s still linear time.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by namespaces being ineffective or vulnerable; I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s as good as it gets for an extensible framework of roll-your-own languages without central authority.<p>The structure of a particular XML-based format (i.e. tag names, use of attributes, etc.) is the responsibility of the author of this format. Yes, some are very sloppy and illogical, but a lot of code is, regardless of the language.<p>I agree about huge arrays; XML was never meant to handle them. But modern tools perform very well on moderate and even large amounts of data; a few hundred megabytes is not a problem at all.<p>XML is not just plausibly reasonable for word processing or web documents, it&#x27;s the only format designed to handle such (mixed) content.<p>There is some shortage of tools, most state-of-art tools now are Java-based and this doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.

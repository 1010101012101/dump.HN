1103043,comment,1101508,1102409,0,0,lambda,,,"Your argument was simply that money is speech, as if it's a tautology. I didn't feel like going through a long, detailed refutation if that's the level of effort you were going to put in.<p>The whole thing about money being speech is not because money actually is speech. The issue is that putting restrictions on how people spend their money can unconstitutionally limit their freedom of speech, or of the press. For instance, if you say that they can speak all they want, but can't spend more than $10 on printing costs, then you've limited their freedom of the press. So, the court can strike down laws about spending money in elections if it unduly restricts people's freedom of speech and of the press.<p>That doesn't mean that all money is speech. Money is trade, commerce; and the Constitution explicitly allows Congress to pass laws relating to interstate commerce (which the court has since broadened to pretty much all commerce or economic activity, even within a single state, as it can affect interstate prices, which I think is somewhat dubious, but that's the precedent we've got).<p>So, it's the tension between these two issues is where we have the debate. Money isn't speech, but because money can be used to buy almost anything, including a forum for your speech, it's hard to block money without also blocking speech.<p>I think that we can do considerably better than what we are doing, however. Paying money directly to a candidate or campaign goes beyond simple speech; that could be construed as bribery. With appropriate limits on campaign contributions, you can reduce the disparity, and make it so that everyone (or almost everyone) can afford the same impact on the campaign, though I still find it a little bit dubious.<p>But beyond campaign contributions, it's hard to determine where to draw the line. It's very easy to write laws which do unjustly forbid certain kinds of political speech. It's also very easy to turn from a democracy into a plutocracy by simply allowing money to buy everything that actually matters in government. I don't know what the right solution is, but I suspect that reducing the financial incentives for congressional staffers and congressmen to act in the interests of those with money will help to get changes in the government that the public actually wants.",1265356073

With WiFi, HD decoding & output and significantly increased storage size, they could turn it from a pure iPod competitor to a significantly better SlingBox/iPod combo. If I walk into a friend's house and have it recognise the network, it should instantly start serving files over wifi, which any pc (Windows Media Center or XBOX, if you're looking for the tie-in) could play. If I want to charge it as it plays, or play particularly high-bandwidth content over a weak network, or output pre-decoded stuff, plug it in directly and stream it that way.<p>As it stands, it can 'only' play 720p. Also, at 16/32 gb options and with current transfer speeds onto the device, the zune can't really achieve this. With 64/128 it starts to be possible, and Wireless N might help for streaming via wifi. Perhaps USB 3.0 will help load it with content faster?<p>They need to milk the early adopter crowd as well, to win back mindshare the Zune has completely failed to grab from the iPod due to being such a ""me too"" project. This means working with all file formats at the very least, and arrangements with Hulu, Netflix, Spotify - if they don't already have them - would be good moves too.",1265355392

However, I have something else to offer. The original poster needs to stop thinking of freelancing as the only thing he does. He needs passive income and affiliate marketing projects. But that requires free time. My suggestion on getting free time is to take those periods where you do sales/marketing/advertising stints for new gigs, and outsource that to offshore virtual assistants. That gives you a little bit of free time to slip in the start of a project, and then in the next month you can finish it. For ideas on what to do, visit mixergy.com and let your mind wander from there. As for affiliate marketing, just start with the advice on affbuzz.com and move from there.",1265353802

Also, pay a sum to Adobe to cause the latest Adobe Reader Plugin to issue this same warning.<p>- Get out of the browser business. It costs you too much money and gives you too little in return. Let everyone use all the other browsers like Firefox, Safari, Opera, Chrome, and others. But if you plan to stay in it, then switch to the Webkit engine and please by all means support CSS3 just as good as Chrome does.<p>- Push for open audio, video, and vector animation standards in HTML5, moving with the pack instead of against it, and don't even bother whether Adobe or Apple are on board with those plans.<p>- Remember the years when Apple was going through the transition from the old OS to the new OS based on BSD UNIX? They had an arrangement where you could run old apps as well as new apps. Microsoft should do something similar, but with Novell Suse Linux.<p>- Take MS Office back to the old interface before the funky menubars, and slim down the interface a good bit so that there aren't so many menu items by default.<p>- Simplify the registry or eliminate it altogether. It's a mess. Linux guys love .conf files.<p>- In the new Linux-based OS, once you lock in where settings are located, quit changing them dramatically because it angers people.<p>- Give Steve Ballmer a golden parachute.<p>- Merge the company with Novell. And if not that, then rename it so that it kind of helps with the new image.<p>- Push for the elimination of software patent laws that you introduced in the first place. But, since that takes a long time to achieve, do the IBM approach for now. That approach is to gobble up a bunch of software patents, but do not sue people who infringe. In fact, legally protect those who infringe, who are also challenged in court, because it generates more business for you, instead.",1265353438

I don't even see how this can be argued. Almost every quality of life metric I can think of has improved: education, life expectancy, and infant mortality have all improved, in addition to harder to measure increases in everyday comfort due to technology. In 2013, even most of the poor have a mobile phone. Almost anyone can walk into a library and talk to you or I on Hacker News.

When handsets are sold at near full list price, the networks can charge just their network costs to customers who are free to shop with unlocked phones.

But you're still building a <i>house</i>, not an opinion about a drill or a nailgun.<p>Ever notice how professionals treat their tools, versus amateurs? Photographers are a great example. Amateur photographers are <i>all about</i> cameras and lenses and tools. They buy gear like there was no tomorrow, and they do very little actual photography. Some of them make it past this phase and change their focus to what photography is really about (light, subject, timing) but most don't.<p>Professional photographers buy cameras for one purpose: because they get the shot. They buy lenses for one purpose: because they get the shot. And they buy everything else they need for one purpose: because it gets the shot. Their focus is the photograph and everything else follows. Of course there is some thought of what lens is right for what job, and what camera works best for what needs, and durability and portability especially; but mostly they use what works because they know it well and it <i>gets the shot.</i> And some pros use the most ridiculous gear that you'd never expect because it works <i>so well for their particular goals.</i><p>There was an article a while back about a Iraq war journalist who used only Olympus 6MP zoom cameras made 5-6 years ago because they were workhorses, extremely portable, and held up to desert conditions. Non-pros probably thought he was crazy and dumb, but he got the shots. He shipped. You <i>have</i> seen his photos in the news, guaranteed. Talking about that gear out of context, it would make zero sense.

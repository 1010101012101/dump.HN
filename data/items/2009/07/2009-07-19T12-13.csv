712894,comment,712653,712706,0,0,drp,,,"In my experience, CPM from AdSense does not scale by itself.  When you're only serving up a few thousand impressions per day, all it takes are a few good advertisers on your keywords for you to get a pretty nice daily payoff, but as soon as you burn through the high CPM ads from AdSense, you get down to their low CPM remnant inventory.<p>For example, at 30k impressions per day, you might make $75 from AdSense at a $2.50 CPM.  If you keep relying on AdSense as your traffic numbers go up to 500k impressions per day, you'll still get the $75, but most of the traffic above that level comes in at a low CPM, say $0.20, and you end up with $169 for that day rather than $1300.<p>The takeaway is that you can't rely on AdSense to scale, and selling your own ads makes sense at a certain traffic level.",1248006639

712890,comment,711910,711910,0,0,cbr,,,"I'm confused by the assertion that a source code audit would catch nothing.  Even if the auditors didn't know that the check would be optimised away, the code is very unnatural.  Normally you check if a pointer is NULL and then deference it.  In a code review, every time I see a pointer dereference I'm thinking: ""how do we know that's not NULL?"".  So a check afterwards should not keep this code from being caught by auditors.",1248006407

It's similar to Python (with more Scheme influence: coroutines, <i>real</i> lambdas, fully lexical scoping, no GIL), but its design favors being small and easy to embed over ""batteries included"" (since if you're scripting a C project, you probably already have the libraries you need).",1248005678
712880,comment,712487,712564,0,0,woodsier,,,"Nearly 2 years ago I started using Google Reader. I signed up for a few great feeds and read it every morning and every night. Over the following months I signed up to more and more feeds, eventually to the point where my reader was flooded with up to a thousand articles per day, and I struggled to find time to do my work between keeping up with this influx of information.<p>Then one particular week where things got too heavy, I just didn't have time.<p>Now, I wouldn't say I have OCD, but I <i>really</i> dislike doing things out of order. I can't watch a trilogy out of order, I can't watch a new TV series unless I start at S01E01. When I returned to my reader I suddenly had 6000+ articles to read, and dreaded the thought that I'd have to read some out of order.<p>I don't know if I'm alone here, but eventually I no longer enjoyed the prospect of opening Google Reader. To keep up with all this information, I felt I had to, but it ceased to be fun. It's probably been a month since I've opened it, just casually reading reddit and HN, as well as a few forums I have in my Firefox Toolbar and a few emails a day I've subscribed to.<p>One day I will likely go back on Google Reader and somehow cull the hundreds of subscriptions, all neatly categorised into topics and subtopics, back down a number I can read in an hour per day. But I suspect I'll find that difficult, and so instead I just stay away.<p>And that's my story about RSS.",1248005675

712873,comment,712447,712447,0,0,kamme,,,"Well, I guess it depends on your situation.<p>Let me take my situation to explain:
I see myself as a non-traditional web developer during my own free time. I like to work at various locations (my desk, sofa, bed, outside, library, ...). But at my normal, regular work, I'm just a traditional developer who demanded a dual screen set-up at the job interview.<p>So you have to ask yourself, are you the more traditional type who does work at a desk? You're better off with a large screen area/desktop. If your desk doesn't matter for you and you're just going to work on a lot of various locations I'd say, go for the laptop. Just for the record, you will notice some people said they used laptops with external monitors. You should ask yourself if you will ever use the machine as a real laptop, because if you don't, you'll probably be off cheaper with a regular desktop due to better upgrade opportunities/longer life in general.",1248005116

2220906,comment,2220836,2220836,0,0,noelwelsh,,,"A lot of these ""no results"" are just bad statistics. When a test shows no result it does not mean there is no significant difference. It means that the test cannot reliably tell given the available data. Technically, this is because as you decrease the probability of a type I error (lower the p-value) you increase the probability of a type II error. To lower the probability of a type II error, and hence have null results actually mean there is no significant difference, you needs lots of hits. Under assumptions that are reasonable for most e-commerce sites (e.g. 5% conversion, you want to distinguish changes of 5%) you need about 100'000 hits. Very few people have this much data, and hence their inferences are flawed. You can do a lot better than A/B testing with better maths.

Nokia fanboys need to realise that they are on a downhill slope right now, and if they continue on that path Apple and Android will bury them and Microsoft. I have owned Nokia phones from Australia's GSM introduction until last year when the lack of Nokia's software capability, in this country at least, forced my hand to the iPhone. Id give anything to go back to Nokia's quality hardware if it had a decent OS. Windows Phone 7 is a really nice OS, but for now is on some of the shittiest phones I have seen. Nokia + Microsoft should hopefully make a really nice bit of gear.",1297767803

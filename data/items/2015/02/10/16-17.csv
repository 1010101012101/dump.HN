For example, this very sentence follows the same general outline of thousands of other sentences. The actual meaning is found where it breaks with the pattern.<p>Another simple example would be image macros. They often follow a very strict pattern; the new information the user wishes to convey is where the pattern is broken.<p>In the same way, stories often follow a number of tropes. These tropes help to establish some basic information about the story, but what really makes it interesting is when the story breaks from the pattern and does something new.",1423587508

An OS needs a huge platform of partners to work, even Blackberry and Microsoft haven&#x27;t succeeded. The only chance is a fork of Android that can build off their software and apps, but look how hard of a time Amazon has with that. (Though obviously a16z is hoping their company Cyanogen can succeed.)<p>2. The more OS&#x27;s there are, the worse it is for companies that have to build apps for multiple systems. It would be easiest if there was just one OS, but like Communism, that doesn&#x27;t work out. So a duopoly seems like the best compromise.",1423587506

9028330,comment,9026281,9026281,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"This is why high-performance commercial databases do most or all of their I/O management and scheduling in userspace. It is not a new idea; it is much more efficient. However, that means you need to reimplement most of what the kernel does in an optimal way.<p>This is relatively common for closed source software but you almost never see these types of userspace I/O designs in open source, which means OSS designs are often leaving integer factors worth of efficiency and performance on the table. For some use cases, companies are very successful selling into this efficiency and performance gap with closed source.<p>Part of the lack of open source is that these designs are not portable, due to OS dependencies and sometimes hardware dependencies if a design is hardcore. I think this is a partial copout; a Linux-only database engine would address the vast majority of real-world deployments. A bigger reason is that the design and implementation of these kinds of userspace kernels is a very high skill and low level art that, frankly, is way outside the expertise of most open source software contributors. For databases in particular, more often than not even the basic design elements of the software are naively done (e.g. MongoDB) and that is lower hanging fruit.",1423587368

They are completely different (and sometimes complementary tools).<p>No, they don&#x27;t solve the same problem, but that&#x27;s not what I was suggesting. What Web Components <i>are</i> trying to solve is the problem of sharing code, and if React doesn&#x27;t play nicely with Web Components it&#x27;s going to make it very difficult for React developers to partake in that sharing. Contrast that with the Angular team who are drastically overhauling their entire framework in order to be compatible with Web Components. I prefer that strategy over the long term (Ember is also actively preparing for Web Components).<p>> I can&#x27;t speak for Facebook but I think you&#x27;re missing the point of React Native. It&#x27;s not a solution to run webapps on native platforms.<p>I am not missing the point. I get that it&#x27;s goal isn&#x27;t to allow web apps to run inside native wrappers.<p>> React Native is a solution to write native UI code with declarative paradigm. That it runs in JS is an implementation detail. If you look at it from that point of view, hybrid vs native doesn&#x27;t even come into equation. &quot;Native&quot; is the original requirement here, as far as I understand it. Unless you propose to not write native apps at all.<p>I&#x27;m proposing it&#x27;s better to either choose to write native apps using native languages and SDKs, or write them as web apps and embed them inside native wrappers like Reapp is doing. Hybrid vs. native <i>does</i> come into the equation because it&#x27;s worth pointing out the pros and cons of every approach to mobile app development.<p>People are frothing at the mouth in response to React Native without fully understanding the tradeoffs inherit with that approach, so it&#x27;s worth properly setting expectations in response to overwhelming hype. Appcelerator has been around for years and solves the same problem in the same way (minus React&#x27;s declarative pattern) and it hasn&#x27;t been a panacea.",1423586754

We mostly agree.<p>The only reason I spoke up is because it irks me that some people are quick to stifle debates on certain topics just because they might involve the Jews. You&#x27;re a classic case, playing the &quot;anti-Semite&quot; card and banging on that &quot;bring onto themselves&quot; key that no one else mentioned but you. To me that says something about your agenda, as most pro-Israel people react that way.<p>For all your hatred of revisionists, you and I should be thankful that we know more accurate death tolls for Majdanek, Auschwitz and the Reinhardt Action camps because of them. Otherwise we&#x27;d still have those inflated, unbelievable numbers that were sacred a couple decades ago. Revisionists are intellectuals first of all (this much even Michael Shermer admitted on C-SPAN) and they have a good track record of smelling bullshit (see David Cole and the Auschwitz museum lying about a reconstructed gas chamber). I think it&#x27;s a shame we thank them by throwing them in jail and you should be ashamed to participate in that censoring behavior.<p>The way to curb intolerance is not to suppress discussion, nor to call people names. The &quot;Hitler vs bankers&quot; story is wrong not because whoever talked about it might be an anti-Semite according to you; it&#x27;s wrong because the facts don&#x27;t check. If revisionists are intellectuals, we must argue with them and show them wrong. Calling them names won&#x27;t do any good because it doesn&#x27;t change what they think.<p>Bottom line is, if Palestine did not aid the Nazis in killing Jews, why must they suffer a holocaust? This motivates more WWII research by independent thinkers than this silly banker/Jews association you have in your head. Bankers are bad because of money printing machines, libor conspiracies, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan folks working at the Fed, and so on. Zero to do with ethnicity. Get this through your head. This association you make is a red herring to avoid discussing the real issue which is the present day holocaust and genocide of the Palestinian people who are also Semites just like their oppressors. I side with the Hasidim Jews and informed secular Jews all over for bravely opposing this disgusting Zionist obsession.<p>If this were really about relocating the Jews, they should just live here in the US, where they are welcome by all rational people including me. Of course, Zionism has zero to do with Jews, and everything to do with power hungry bankers that want control of a place where real money comes out of the ground and from where they can run pipelines to 90% of the world. But please, go on distracting everyone about how everything is about the Jews.",1423586693

With that we increased the accuracy of the hair and scalp recognition within the OpenCV project. However, this required quite a bit of algorithmic training [3]. Also, this did not include a set of vector points drawn around the subject, just a bounding box. This is a rather difficult problem set.<p>Now, if you have seen these fun little apps which show you what your hair would look like with a new style (or what you would look like with a set of glasses, or a new dress), this uses very little actual recognition. Basically they take a picture of you within a general &quot;person shaped bounding box&quot; or for hair a &quot;head shaped bounding box&quot; and then overlay the new style on top of the area where your hair, glasses, or clothes should be. This is relatively simple (especially in comparison to actual recognition). Might it solve some of your problem?<p>[1] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1425/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1425/</a><p>[2] This accuracy was for the entire algorithmic set.

The frontend was very high level (and had no real common AST between the frontends), the backend was very low level.<p>There was nothing in between.<p>We cherry picked the state of the art in compilers and research, and build a production quality IR and optimizer out of it.<p>This research has not really changed that much in about 10-15 years. Most of the research these days focuses not on straight compiler opts, but on things like serious loop transforms, and helping runtimes (GPU, GC, etc), or dynamic languages.<p>You can see  all the tree ssa work here: <a href=""https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/ChangeLog.tree-ssa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/ChangeLog....</a><p>This covers only until the branch was merged. At that point, it was &quot;not a piece of crap&quot;, but this was before people added all the stuff on top of this architecture.\nOn top of that architecture, it took another few  years to get good, and a few years after that to get really good.<p>Bringing us to today.<p>LLVM was started around the same time, but had less contributors back then.<p>Essentially, you could view it as &quot;instead of build something in between two really old parts, what could we do if we just redid it all&quot;.  People thought it was a waste of time for the most part, but Chris Lattner persevered, found a bunch of crazy people to help him over the years, and here we are.<p>Because you see,  it turns out compiler technology has not really changed at all.  So, algorithmically, LLVM and GCC <i>implement the same optimization techniques</i> in the middle of their compilers.  Because there is nothing better to do.  Just slightly different engineering tradeoffs.  To put it another way:  Outside of loop transforms, essentially static language compilers targeting CPU architectures are solved. We know how to do everything we want to do, and do it well.  It just has to be implemented.<p>So given enough time/effort, LLVM and GCC will produce as good of code as each other there.  The question becomes &quot;will they keep up with each other as engineering/tuning happens&quot; and &quot;who can generate great code faster&quot;.<p>The problem for GCC on this front is three fold\n1. The backend, despite being pretty heroic at this point,  really needs a complete rewrite, but people value portability over fast code.<p>LLVM, having started completely from scratch, has a modern, usable backend.  They are not afraid to throw stuff away.<p>2.  For any given thing you can implement, it&#x27;s a lot easier to do it in LLVM than GCC, so, given time, LLVM will produce faster code because it takes less work to make it do so than it does to make GCC do so.<p>3. Because it was architected differently and more modernly, clang/LLVM are significantly faster at compiling than GCC.  GCC can remove most if not all of the middle end time (and does), but it&#x27;s still slow in other places, and that&#x27;s really really hard to fix without fundamental changes (See #1)",1423586212

A total read-through of those books can be done in a 3-day weekend if you read the whole day, so if you want a rough idea of the time commitment of a centireading, it&#x27;s about a month of day-long readings. Another way to view it is a task of reading two books a week for a year.<p>Like the Zelazny books, you need to have something which has the right &quot;flow&quot; for you to really make it work.<p>My English professor at Cornell was fond of saying, &quot;There is no good writing, only good rewriting. There is no good reading, only good rereading.&quot; He calls to mind how it&#x27;s easier and more powerful to condense and re-articulate your article/book when you know where it starts, where it ends, and how it gets from A to B: then he comments, so too you get a greater appreciation of the details of what you&#x27;re reading when you can see the overall story.<p>In the case of the Roger Zelazny books, there was one section in particular where this happened. We see a flashback from Merlin&#x27;s perspective to a time when he is a teenager and he takes his all-to-human girlfriend on an insane journey through impossible landscapes which putatively exist just-next-door. In the discussion that follows, it seems like, by not telling her his secret, he&#x27;s shutting her out:<p><pre><code>        What could I say? It was not only that telling her of Shadow would disturb, \n    perhaps destroy, her view of reality. At the heart of my problem lay the \n    realization that it would also require telling her how I knew this, which would \n    mean telling her who I am, where I am from, what I am--and I was afraid to give \n    her this knowledge. I told myself that it would end our relationship as surely as \n    telling her nothing would; and if it must end either way, I would rather we parted\n    without her possessing this knowledge. Later, much later, I was to see this for \n    the rationalization it was; my real reason for denying her the answers she desired\n    was that I was not ready to trust her, or anyone, so close to me as I really am. \n    Had I known her longer, better--another year, say--I might have answered her. I \n    don&#x27;t know. We never used the word &quot;love,&quot; though it must have run through her \n    mind on occasion, as it did through mine. It was, I suppose, that I didn&#x27;t love \n    her enough to trust her, and then it was too late. So, &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you,&quot; were \n    my words.\n        &quot;You have some power that you will not share.&quot;\n        &quot;Call it that, then.&quot;\n        &quot;I would do whatever you say, promise whatever you want promised.&quot;\n        &quot;There is a reason, Julia.&quot;\n        She is on her feet, arms akimbo. &quot;And you won&#x27;t even share that.&quot;\n        I shake my head.\n        &quot;It must be a lonely world you inhabit, magician, if even those who love you \n    are barred from it.&quot;\n        At that moment it seems she is simply trying her last trick for getting an \n    answer from me. I screw my resolve yet tighter. &quot;I didn&#x27;t say that.&quot;\n        &quot;You didn&#x27;t have to. It is your silence that tells me. If you know the road to\n    Hell too, why not head that way? Good-bye!&quot;\n        &quot;Julia. Don&#x27;t...&quot;\n        She chooses not to hear me. Still life with flowers...\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re just reading through this, it seems perhaps like she&#x27;s gone power-hungry; you sympathize with Merlin. But read through it again. Pay particular attention to that sentence in the first paragraph: <i>we never used the word &quot;love&quot;</i>, and then just consider the exchange, &quot;It must be a lonely world you inhabit, magician, if even those who love you are barred from it.&quot; / &quot;I didn&#x27;t say that.&quot; On rereading, you realize that from her perspective, she&#x27;s jumping out into vulnerable territory, using this word which they&#x27;ve never used before, and when he shuts her down, from her perspective he&#x27;s basically saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t say that I loved you.&quot;",1423586149

9028176,comment,9026815,9027703,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> How about this: I like published formats that become standards as and when they gain multiple implementations.<p>That is how the standards process generally works these days.<p>> The web features we use are there because one vendor or another implemented them, experimentally (again I refer you to javascript, or the <img> tag), and they became standards some time after that.<p>That was a long time ago, when there were few browsers and the Web was much smaller. Nowadays, whenever a browser ships anything, content immediately starts relying on it, and it becomes frozen for all time. None of your other examples have billions of pieces of content; the probability that some content starts relying on the random corner cases of whatever you ship is almost certain. That is one of the most important reasons the standards process exists: to allow multiple vendors a seat at the table in order to create something that makes sense, as opposed to sitting down, writing a pile of code, having content depend on the random bugs and corner cases in your implementation, and forcing all other vendors to reverse engineer your code. (Being open source does <i>not</i> make reverse engineering free, and doesn&#x27;t even make it that much easier: the HTML5 parsing algorithm was reverse engineered from IE6 without looking at the source code.)<p>> This is the model that works, and google is trying to continue it. Best of luck to them.<p>It&#x27;s also what got us quirks mode, the content sniffing algorithm, the gratuitous complexity of HTML5 parsing, marquee, blink, and the incredibly underdocumented and hideously complex tables specification. I could go on.<p>You&#x27;re portraying CSS2 as a failure, but CSS2 is actually a great example of something that is <i>implementable</i> by virtue of being standardized. CSS2 only looks bad because you can go to the standard and look at the complexity, but automatic table layout (what we had before) is much worse, being defined by a pile of C++ code that few people in the world know, with corner cases and weirdnesses a mile long. To this day, table layout is essentially implemented by reverse engineering Gecko. As someone who has implemented both features, I much prefer the former.",1423586080

Interestingly, I read this just after reading Bob Dylan&#x27;s pretty fascinating speech (delivered ac couple of days ago at musicales.<p><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-grammys-2015-transcript-of-bob-dylans-musicares-person-of-year-speech-20150207-story.html#page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-gr...</a><p>Bob Dylan stresses the importance of how many times he listened to a song and how much of an influence it had on what he wrote:<p>&quot;For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one  song and sing it next in an hour if I&#x27;d heard it just once.<p>If you sang &quot;John Henry&quot; as many times as me -- &quot;John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I&#x27;ll die with that hammer in my hand.&quot;<p>If you had sung that song as many times as I did, you&#x27;d have written &quot;How many roads must a man walk down?&quot; too. &quot;<p>Dylan says this repeatedly about many of his songs (I really do recommend reading his speech).<p>I do think there&#x27;s some merit to this (though of course I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite that simple).  It&#x27;s also interesting to keep something in mind.  It&#x27;s easy to do some things 100 times, it&#x27;s harder to do other things 100 times.  I&#x27;ve listened to plenty of songs 100 times - I think the interesting thing about Dylan was that he was listening to these songs with an unusual engagement, and that they were (at the time) somewhat unusual songs to be listening to 100 times.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s hard to read Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses 100 times, but Ulysses isn&#x27;t an undiscovered work.  Probably the real key is to listen to or read something 100 times that people don&#x27;t realize understand the value of quite yet and that takes considerable time and effort to understand.

Their business model revolves around licensing the mono runtime to end users (in this case Developers) along with some extra platform specific code. In the case of iOS that is a statically linked exe build from AOT compilation of the CLR code. For Android that is a runtime that sits on the device and is shared for each exe, and for Mac that is taking the Mono Runtime and moving it in to the App package.<p>Yes, iOS was a lot of work. Yes, if they want to make it a commercial venture, that is their right, but Miguel has gone on record stating that no one else can do this due to the way the Mono runtime is licensed. They refused to give a static linking exception, as some other libraries do, so basically your only option is their solution or your own written from scratch. This is why the CoreCLR is cool.<p>Also - did you notice Mac is in there too? If you build a self contained package using Mono (embed the runtime in the App Bundle) they want you to pay for that now. Even though this has about zero to do with static linking.... I had a 10 minute long argument with a Xamerin representative about how retarded this was, as people have been embedding the Mono Runtime in their Mac apps for quite a long time now. But no, apparently we now pay for that.<p>I was on the Monotouch Beta and it looked so good.

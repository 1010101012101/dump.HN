I liked to draw, paint, make stuff.<p>When I discovered programming, I saw it as the much the same thing, only better; being digital, you have fewer arbitrary constraints than the Real World.   Imagination was the only real limit.  <p>Software is opinionated reality, the ultimate playground and toy chest.   I'm still surprised that more people don't find it intrinsically fascinating.  Go figure. :)",1191686161

Google's pagerank is computer science.  Recommendation systems, like Amazon and Netflix use, are computer science.  Computer science is about discovering new ways to design bridges -- not about building them.",1191685918

Learning Basic from a really motivated teacher who said in 20 years that everyone would need to know at least basic programming since everyone would be working on a computer for their job.  He wasn't that far off.<p>What crushed my inner hacker?  University computer science where everything was very strict and restraining, or perhaps it was my focus.<p>What re-sparked it?  Lisp briefly for inspiring me to code in a better way.  Then Python :)",1191685730
64068,comment,63617,63714,0,0,timr,,,"As they should.  It's one thing to give puzzles to an inexperienced kid who has yet to prove herself.  It's quite another to throw them at a senior candidate whom you're probably <i>recruiting</i> based upon their known experience and skill.<p>Horses for courses.",1191685512
64067,comment,64034,64064,0,0,cperciva,,,"I also ask myself how frequently it is necessary to apply the plot and characterization -- or for that matter, grammar and spelling, apparently -- to blog posts.  Gulliver's Travels is better writing than most blog posts, just like the FreeBSD kernel is better code than Reddit.  If most Web 2.0 applications don't apply many concepts from Computer Science, it says more to me about the quality of Web 2.0 applications than it does about the importance of Computer Science.",1191685207

64065,comment,64034,64064,0,0,amichail,,,"Well maybe some advanced algorithms are important (e.g., encryption), but they are part of libraries.  You do not need to worry about how they work just as you do not need to worry about the physics behind pens or the way a word processor is constructed when writing a novel.  ",1191684670
64064,comment,64034,64052,0,0,ochiba,,,"Whereas the original ""pen science is to writing as CS is to web 2.0"" analogy might be awfully skewed, you do have to ask yourself how frequently it is necessary to apply the kind of algorithms and techniques [that CS is in part comprised of] in a typical Web 2.0 application.",1191684525
64063,comment,64034,64052,0,0,amichail,,,"I'm no fan of Dijkstra, at least when it comes to his views of what CS should be all about.  He wanted to turn a rather boring field into something that is much worse.<p>The point of the analogy is that implementation -- essentially what CS is all about -- is not interesting just as the way you construct a pen or use it to write grammatical sentences is not interesting.

The conversation naturally veers toward common ground where a relationship can be built. I haven't seen a company reproduce this.""<p>It happens a lot on LiveJournal.  I'm still in touch with some of the folks I met 5 years ago on there.  I've met them in real life.  Some of them have introduced me to all their friends, who I'm also still in touch with (in some cases, moreso than the original friend).  A couple of my now-RL friends met on LiveJournal; they're now married.  The wedding pictures tagged guests with their LiveJournal usernames instead of their real names.<p>FaceBook and MySpace spread largely through existing social networks, which is why their growth was so fast.  LiveJournal, blogs, webcomics, and the myriad niche forums have been forming <i>new</i> social networks, which is much slower and doesn't get as much press attention.  It's there, though, if you're looking in the right places.",1191684172
64061,comment,63978,64027,0,0,derefr,,,"I'm not sure about that. Picture some widely-used public school management package written to be used over the Facebook API. Suddenly, every new student [high school students, remember, not college] <i>has</i> to get Facebook, as part of the enrollment process. Then, since all the friends they make at school already ""use"" the service, they start really using it.",1191684133

When it actually became possible for ordinary people to buy a computer (the ZX81!), of course we saved up for it. When we got the computer, of course we had to learn how to program it, since it didn't have any software.",1191683830

64055,comment,63711,64037,0,0,vlad,,,"You don't lose points for college in my system.  Remember, Paul says he accepts everybody who is good enough, not the top 20 teams.  Whichever way you reach 13-15 on my scale, you're likely to get an interview.  We'll have to see.<p>""And yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd been to elite colleges.""<p>Paul ""still overestimates"" such students, so they're more likely to get an interview.  And since he used the word ""still"", it means he feels he's still biased at this present time.  How do you think these test cases came about, anyway?<p>""college = 0""<p>I doubt that this can ever be true.  Paul still asks for the students' colleges.  In other words, he's still figuring this out.  What he means is, nobody needs to have a degree or a good college to create a successful startup.  That is true.  But I do think there are good signs about a person that uniquely pre-qualify them if the student is from a good college:<p>1) The fact that the school accepted them, matters least (like Paul says in the quote above.)<p>2) However, I do think Paul considers it a sign of dedication if a student from MIT wants to leave or delay entry in favor of YC, or if they've recently graduated from Harvard or Stanford and instead of proceeding to graduate school or possibly a six-figure job, to spend a couple of years living on ramen noodles.  <p>3) Regardless of what Paul thinks, VC's probably love that stuff, if the startup doesn't have lots of traction yet.  <p>The big VC investments seems to go to those from elite schools:
MIT (no product when selected by YC, 4m VC before product was finalized), Cambridge (no product when selected by YC, 400k  VC), Yale (no product when selected by YC, unknown VC money), Stanford (likely no product when selected by YC, Sequoia Capital VC).<p>4) I suggested good colleges would get +2, not just elite colleges.",1191682882

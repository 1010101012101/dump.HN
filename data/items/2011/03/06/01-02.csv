2293187,comment,2291968,2292808,0,0,cagey,,,"I've been using MsysGit (Windows) for about 18 months as a ""local vcs"" wrapper around a sucky vcs (Accurev).  Until the most recent MsysGit release, I used the ""git bash"" shell exclusively: for each Accurev workspace, I had a CMD shell where I ran builds in the w/s, and a git bash shell where I operate git for that w/s.  This was mostly satisfactory (being able to write true bash scripts to automate git a tiny bit was cool), but when working with sometimes a dozen or more workspaces, it can get a little time consuming to locate the respective shell's mate.  Anyway, MsysGit has mostly worked quite nicely for my limited purposes.  However I am now evaluating hg as a possible replacement for Accurev (I'm running a quasi-import over the weekend).  I'm also running a git import in parallel (mostly to compare repo size growth over time), and to do that (in lockstep) I'm running git from a CMD shell; so far I've not had any problems using git in CMD (wait, git's interpretation of the %EDITOR% environment variable in CMD is broken).  Why hg, after all my experience with git?  As mentioned elsewhere in this discussion: MsysGit (git for Windows) is like a ""second class citizen""; it's pretty clear that the git creators have a negative religious attitude about Windows, thus expecting equal functionality and support on Windows is folly.  The MsysGit discussion threads reflect a shoestring operation, with overwhelmed developers solely scratching their own itch (fair enough as far as it goes).  Whereas hg treats Windows as a first class platform (presumably because it was designed and built with that in mind).  I still like git's branching feature (which is why I chose it initially over hg), but between hg and git, hg is IMHO the only pragmatic choice for a ""Windows shop"".",1299376191

Sure you will be competing with programmers from India/Russia/Phillipines - but you can underbid them all and buyers in the US will hire you - as being in the US and cheaper than offshore programmers will be a huge plus for you. \n2) Buy a domain name and build websites using Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal (pick any one), get a domain name for $8.00, use one of thousands of free themes, add some content, RSS feeds, add Google Adsense (all free), drive some traffic using SEO techniques. Then list the site for sale on Flippa, Ebay, Craigslist or any of the other  sites to sell stuff. You can easily sell a site for anywhere from $50 to $500.

He makes it look easy, and some kids just follow their dreams without building a support base first. Remember that for every guy like pg, there are 9 others just like him who went bankrupt. Coming out of college, you should always try to find a stable, legit job and try to build up a capital base. Get paid by someone else and develop a level of professional competency, build up your credit score and take out a loan and do something on the side, and only go solo once who you have some stable revenue. This is the way to do it, unless you come from money or are lucky.<p>So here's my steps to you for changing things around:<p>1) Completely revamp your resume, and to stop referring to yourself as unemployed. You were self-employed.<p>2) write down a list of all the competitors your startup had that are located nearby. Find out the phone numbers/emails to the higher ups in those companies through web searching.<p>3) phone or email those guys, and say that you are writing a freelance article about the industry. Say you want to interview them for their expertise (all guys love to have their ego's stroked: that's the way to get that introduction you want).<p>4) during the interview (preferably in person, or by phone), ask them some general questions about the industry, and mention that you had attempted to do a startup in the field but failed. Try to ask questions related to how their business succeeded, in order to compare and contrast with your own experiences. Ask them to give you advice on whether to pursue another startup in this field (even though you may have no intention of doing so) or look for a job in the industry.<p>Now at this point, it can go 1 of 2 ways. If you're lucky, the other person may see your interest for the field, and ask to see some of your work. If it's good, you will probably move to the top of the pile when a new hire is needed. \nIf that doesn't happen, then repeat as necessary with every other company.<p>That's a better bet than anything else out there, don't waste your time with the craigslist blackhole",1299374822

Build it around their strength. Why? because weaknesses can be fixed. Strengths cannot be fixed without undermining an opponent's own strategy.<p>From this, I get that there are two kinds of problems with a product or service: A weakness, which is something bad that is orthogonal to a product's value proposition, and a drawback, which is an integral part of the value proposition. An example of an Apple drawback would have been its one button mouse for many years: During the period when many Mac buyers were first-time computer users, the single button was part of the simplicity of the interface, but it also was annoying to those who had more experience and wanted more power at their fingertips.<p>I remember this when thinking about tethering my iPad. This is a weakness, not a drawback. It can certainly be fixed without undermining the iPad's value proposition. If somebody starts selling a lot of tablets that sync to the cloud, Apple can release a firmware or iOS update that syncs to the cloud and boom, no more weakness.<p>It's annoying but it isn't deeply tied to the iPad's value proposition. So I predict that if and when Apple thinks it is more of a hinderance than a help, it will be changed, and the change will be fairly painless.",1299374642

I've been living out of a backpack and travelling (adventuring?) for the last two plus years (well, until very recently), and I've grown something of a thin skin for when people vilify the US without much travel experience of their own.<p>> Yes you can say that, say, an Iraqi citizen will have a hard time getting in to any country, not just the US; but when we're talking people from England, Europe, China, hell, even Mexico and Canada<p>England and most western European countries don't require visas to enter the US at all, since they qualify under the VWP. Mexico and Canada only recently required a passport to entry, and at most high-volume crossings you can use a special state/federal ID instead.<p>Harrowing, I think, is too strong of a word. Several years ago I was stopped at the Canadian border on I5 (between Seattle and Vancouver) and had my car searched. I had to sit in an immigration office for an hour and answer a ton of questions. That's about as bad as it can get between NAFTA countries and it's hardly what I'd call harrowing.<p>All of that having been said: You're preaching to the choir. I'm 100% in favor of relaxing entry and work requirements for foreigners into the US. I think that people overreact about the US requirements when for most first world citizens it's not that big of a deal, and for the rest of the world it's complicated just about everywhere else too.<p>> 20-something backpackers who get hassled crossing into America today, or who choose to go to a different country for 6 months instead of face American border bureaucracy, will take those experiences with them when they enter industry and leadership positions in the future.<p>Agreed, but this has more to do with foreign policy and international PR rather than just border security and hassle.<p>> Edit: another anecdote--on entering New Zealand I was asked for proof of onward travel (as I later found out, a requirement to enter the country). I didn't have any; I had planned on staying a few months then carrying on to Australia when I felt like it. When I told the agent this, she laughed and waved me on. Can you imagine a US border agent doing that?<p>Counter anecdote: I once flew back from Mexico without a passport or any identification other than a driver's license (this was right after the passport requirements for flight went into effect -- Mexico didn't require a US passport for entry, but the US required a passport for re-entry) and had to convince the CBP agent that I was an American. He asked me a couple questions and ended with ""Who was your freshman English teacher?"" which I laughed at and said: ""Are you serious?! Does anyone remember that?"" and he laughed and let me in.

Aspects are user defined sets based on social context, eg 'work', 'school'.

If you did any real programming work during that time, it still counts.  I've seen plenty of resumes with ""sole proprietor"" type jobs.   Maybe you don't get a job with a large company, but someone who is versatile and used to doing whatever it takes is perfect for someone else's startup.<p>I don't think it is wise pitching yourselves to companies who are hiring 100K+ engineers saying you are willing to work for minimum wage.  It shows a lack of confidence that you are selling yourself so far under market.   Pricing is often a signal for quality.   More importantly, the cost of a bad engineering hire is far greater than the salary you're being paid -- a bad engineering hire takes time to get rid of, and often produces negative work output.   People end up cleaning up a mess, opportunities are lost while a bad engineer flails at what should be simple code, etc.   A bad engineer could work for free and still be a worse value for a company than an engineer making market rate.   This is the signal you're sending when working for minimum wage.",1299373491

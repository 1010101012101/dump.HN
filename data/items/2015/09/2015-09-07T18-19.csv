At best, documents could provide fresh ideas - but document discoverability + adaptability feel severely inadequate.<p>What the success of this site does speak to is an underlaying desire by educators to have a shared resource for the rapid creation/adaptation/implementation of curriculum materials.<p>Teaching still remains a craft-based occupation and experienced educators naturally want to individually create their own curriculum materials; however, I believe this has less to do with the inherent inadequacy of shared documents then it is the cumbersome nature of adapting someone else&#x27;s documents to your purposes. A strong teacher creates their curriculum documents based on the specific needs/interests of their students (not the ones down the hall, or the ones from last year) so even with the &#x27;best&#x27; lesson materials they will need the documents to remain flexible.<p>Yes - a Word .doc does this to a point, but even fighting the oddities of formatting can be a sufficient enough time-suck to abandon the document and begin from scratch. The document format should instead be a combination of structural curricular patterns (sharable + driving discoverability through the assigned utility of a given pattern [e.g. discussion pattern for groups of four]) + instructor assigned style guide (largely automated in application based on instructors previous style/formatting decisions). I couldn&#x27;t care less about your font/color choices (which may conflict with customs in my classroom) - but I do care about the underlaying utility of your {activity, introduction, guide, etc.}.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t save me time (in doing something I&#x27;m already capable of) or empower me to do something (I&#x27;m not otherwise able to do), then what&#x27;s the point?",1441652373

So while this scheme benefits the operator, it provides negligible benefit to the client.<p>* You are reliant on the secondary CA to remain static (or having a backup CA) - this is the same problem as the original simply shifting the capability up one level - maybe this is OK.<p>Overall, this approach does provide more flexibility to the operator of the site - but provides no to negligible additional security on the client side (it upgrades the capability from being able to mimic any CA to being ale to mimic a specific CA), and may even put clients at greater risk - since there is now an additional avenue of certificate rotation which means extra code, extra verification to mess up etc.<p>These were a few thought that jumped into my brain - I would like to see a more detailed threat model / paper exploring some new schemes as I think there are wins in this space that haven&#x27;t been realized yet - and there maybe improvements / clarifications which can improve this model further.",1441652168

10182534,comment,10174464,10174464,0,0,sargun,,,"ZMQ presents its own set of challenges, because it&#x27;s typically implemented as a linked-in native library, and this presents some interesting safety problems. In a previous life, we tried out ZMQ as a replacement to RabbitMQ for a use-case that we didn&#x27;t actually need long-term persistence for (real-time notifications), but we found Java, and Python ZMQ to provide exciting, hard-to-debug memory leaks, as well as plain segfaults. But, for some time I&#x27;ve been thinking about this, because having a smart client library does allow you to do really neat things efficiently (See: Fast Paxos: <a href=""http://msr-waypoint.com/pubs/64624/tr-2005-112.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msr-waypoint.com/pubs/64624/tr-2005-112.pdf</a>, Chubby: <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/chubby-osdi06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.co...</a>). I think the ideal model is to split up responsibilities in a distributed system between nodes that are smart clients, and the rest of the system, and in this, linked-in drivers can continue to utilize simple protocols like RPC + Protocol Buffers, and the actual system can use more complex, higher-level semantics, like dual-dispatch to smooth over latency. -- For whatever reason, people are more comfortable with running a totally foreign, binary library in their same process / memory space, as opposed to running a binary and depending on it. -- I realize that operationally, it&#x27;s somewhat more complex to do the later, but that&#x27;s a question about maturity of methods. We&#x27;ve seen the Go community adopt this approach somewhat with things like the Packer plugin architecture (<a href=""https://www.packer.io/docs/extend/plugins.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.packer.io/docs/extend/plugins.html</a>).",1441651769

They had displays on the wall listing the most popular products, and a few sales people to answer questions. IIRC there were approx 40-50 products displayed.

I am willing to grant that Champaign/Urbana is not the ideal place to live for everyone; however, it affords me the best of everything I want from a community, without a lot of what I perceive as the drawbacks of places like Chicago or SV or other large metro areas. I would not live anywhere else, and I know that others feel the same way that I do; and it is fine if others disagree.<p>2. (This ought to start a firestorm of comments...) I have worked for three different companies based in SV or SF and have lots of friends still in that area. It has been my personal experience that people there are motivated by money concerns much more than they are in CU. In conversations with my friends there, they say things like, &quot;Come work at XYZ and they&#x27;ll up your salary by X&quot;; or, &quot;If you come to this startup you&#x27;ll get tons of stock options&quot;; etc. This is totally my opinion, but I believe that people in SV are so worried about money because they really can&#x27;t afford to live there unless they make a <i>lot</i> of it. And again, my opinion is that this influences people to move jobs frequently in order to get a bump in pay, a big sign-on bonus, or the hope for a big stock payout. The SV culture encourages frequent moves. I certainly cannot deny that people in CU talk about money, but when my friends here try to pull me away to another job, they often talk about the cool tech they are working on or how much they love the culture of their company, and not about the money. It is because people in Tech in CU can afford to live very well on modest salaries. (My spouse doesn&#x27;t work and we still live really well.) Again, just my opinion, but I believe that this is the real reason why people stay longer in their jobs in CU. It isn&#x27;t because they don&#x27;t have options. (I feel that I have many options, and my options seem to be increasing all the time.) It is because they are not forced to move just to afford to live.<p>3. Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day, and anyone who has been in the community for a while can see that there have been great improvements in our startup culture over the last decade or two. And, just as Rome fell, SV will not be the center of the Tech Universe forever.<p>4.

The University has done an amazing amount of good for the community, if only by being one of the major economic engines in CU, and I appreciate that. It isn&#x27;t their &quot;responsibility&quot; to build a startup community in CU. However, they have done a lot to advance it. The U of I Research Park is a great example of that.<p>6. A few people in this thread seem to be blaming UIUC for what they perceive as startup culture issues. It takes a lot of hard work from many players (individuals and organizations) to build a great startup community, so if there are failings, stop blaming others and do something about it.",1441650694

I don&#x27;t see it answered in the article. I don&#x27;t see it asked in the article. It&#x27;s simply assumed.<p>There are many different kinds of zombies. Most of them are essentially immortal unless shot in the head. They may move rather slowly, but they have great strength. They may become blind, but they often get a great sense of hearing. They tend to rot if left alone but can last very, very long if preserved properly. There are instances of zombies who continue to be conscious after zombification and who continue to do what they did before (think Mr. Slant from T. Pratchett books). They are unlikely to change their ways, but sometimes it&#x27;s a good thing. There are zombies who retain their emotions (see Sankarea manga). And so on.<p>It&#x27;s equally true for open source projects. Even if abandoned (for some definition of abandonment) for the same amount of time, two different projects may become two very different kinds of zombies. LiveScript, for example, is a zombie if you look at its mailing list, but is one of the most productive (for me, of course) compile-to-JS languages out there. StumpWM (a Common Lisp WM) is also nearly dead, yet it&#x27;s still the best WM if you want a WM that&#x27;s hackable.<p>On the other hand, there are projects which we&#x27;d really like to see dead, yet they refuse to die or even zombify. Projects which suck a massive amount of resources into their life support systems without any visible improvements.<p>> and if you find one in the wild: run!<p>Or you could just take a nice pump-action shotgun (ie. ability to read and write the code) with you and have a good time.<p>In short: this article is shallow. It reads like a generic advice written only to write something, without any deeper insight. And the author seems to know very little about zombies...",1441650604

10182387,comment,10171783,10180416,0,0,pron,,,"> Are you really postulating that because society categorizes something as a group, therefore members of this group suddenly act in a completely altruistic manner towards their groupmates?<p>Huh? No. Why do you think I think that? Social groups often have shared experiences (often because society views them as a group), and people with shared experience often have shared needs, and to get those needs you need power. If you don&#x27;t have the power, other groups have power over you, and they may not share your needs, and have their own, and as a result act less in your interest.<p>There is an interesting concept called ingroup/outgroup[1] that is subject to <i>a lot</i> of current research in social psychology, which has found that kids at a very young age display ingroup allegiance and outgroup rejection even for made up groups (e.g. experimenters tell a kid, &quot;you&#x27;re in the blue group&quot;, and then ask them play the dictator game[2], namely decide how much and what kind of rewards to give to another kid they&#x27;ve never met, who they only know belongs to their made-up group or not. The group association makes a lot of difference (incidentally in boys more than girls, but that depends on age). Ingroup/outgroup is a well-known, well-studied concept, but it&#x27;s not altruism, let alone &quot;complete altruism&quot;. It&#x27;s not entirely relevant to my view anyway, but since you brought up altruism I thought I&#x27;d explain the &quot;proper term&quot; for the &quot;feeling&quot; one has towards one&#x27;s own social group vs. others. Again, even ingroup/outgroup is not directly related to the objective unequal distribution of power.<p>> That&#x27;s a pretty remarkable claim. Interestingly, the only people I&#x27;ve seen making this claim besides you are the (normatively) racist side of the human biodiversity movement. You might find Jayman&#x27;s debunking of these folks enlightening - he&#x27;s focused on ethnic groups specifically, but social groups have even less motivation for altruism.<p>Remarkable indeed! Why in god&#x27;s name would you think I make that claim?[3]<p>> Your real world choices are a) accept unequal representation or b) kick Asians out. Which do you favor?<p>I must say I&#x27;m surprised you think that. First -- this isn&#x27;t a zero-sum game. Groups that are underrepresented in power are often underrepresented because their ability to achieve a good social standing (and a good chance at power) through education, connections, familiarity with the business world or politics etc.. is very much reduced. That&#x27;s precisely where society&#x27;s economic potential lies. If they get better education, better connections and so on, the economy would grow very, very significantly (they will make more money to buy things <i>and</i> be more productive). Second, if you <i>think</i> it is a zero-sum game, you must accept the possibility (which is the reality) that the current state of things is <i>after</i> blacks have been kicked out. You&#x27;ve already kicked out a group out of the economic process[4], and all we want is to let them back in. So, yeah, if it&#x27;s a zero-sum game (it isn&#x27;t), the end result will be more-or-less equal representation in power (not tech alone -- I said that we have no problem in one community being overrepresented in one seat of power and underrepresented in another). Of course, it&#x27;s not a zero-sum game, because those who have no access to power are almost always in a state of &quot;untapped potential&quot; that benefits everyone.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_game"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_game</a><p>[3]: In this particular case, the entirety of their contribution to the economic process for hundreds of years has been stolen from them, and then, with whatever money they could earn (without any inheritance or connections) you disallowed them from fully participating in the economy by preventing them from buying land, voting (and thus getting their interests heard and help from the government -- like other groups) and starting businesses with the same opportunities of white businesses. All this has sort-of ended as recently as 45 years ago.<p>[3]: BTW, out of curiosity I read the link, and I think it&#x27;s not a lot less ridiculous as the claims it wishes to debunk. The famous Price equation, which models altruism as kin selection was never meant to be a full explanation of altruism <i>in people</i> (although it bothered George Price enough to kill himself) but in slime-mold and ants. Altruism in people is probably a result of a completely different process, because it operates at a much higher level of abstraction. That guy&#x27;s analysis makes as much sense as tracing human ability to solve differential equations back to kin selection. Both (altruism and ODEs) are probably side effects of something else.",1441649303

Second, you can start listening pretty much any podcast from 1 minute mark and some even further, such as 5 minutes, and not miss a thing.

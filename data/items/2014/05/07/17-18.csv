The portion of that market that&#x27;s not yet monetized is likely very small. Besides, slowing down general-purpose web traffic makes it look like your service just totally sucks ass.<p>But more generally, slow-loading websites make the ISP&#x27;s service look shitty. There&#x27;s almost no cost for them to just QoS the low-bandwidth stuff up and it makes people think their service is better.",1399485595

I ported some Python code, whose logic took weeks of fine-tuning, to C# in less than a day.  Go still has a garbage collector and its type system is similar in philosophy to Python&#x27;s duck typing. Unless you are porting extra dynamic code (eval(), monkey-patching) or deeply intertwined with an unusual library, it should be a fast process.  On the other hand, I was leaving Python get real OS threads, not to increase performance.",1399485442

I haven&#x27;t really tried to publicize it, admittedly, though I post here about it occasionally and hardly anyone ever responds.<p>Despite this discouraging experience, it still seems to me that the open-source world needs crowdfunding, and Kickstarter-style crowdfunding isn&#x27;t ideal.

The rocket engines function a bit differently than the jet engines, all the problems are bigger by the order of magnitude. The engines have to sustain immense temperature extremes, which in turn change the characteristics of the parts. What&#x27;s usable on the first launch can be just a trash the next time.

7711612,comment,7711040,7711040,21,0,thinkpad20,,,"Ah, the ole &quot;quicksort in 3 lines&quot; argument. There are a few things I take from this.<p>The good:<p>1) The definition of the algorithm is clear. It shows &quot;how quicksort works.&quot;<p>2) It&#x27;s trivial to see (and prove) that the function will terminate, and almost as trivial to prove that it will result in a sorted list. So, it is easy to show correctness.<p>3) The polymorphism makes this an easily reusable function right out of the box.<p>The bad:<p>1) That implementation is very inefficient. At a glance I think it would be O(n^2) time. (Edit: this is misleading, because it&#x27;s only O(n^2) in the same way that quicksort is always O(n^2). It is inefficient in terms of memory usage, though. And possibly other ways; for instance, I&#x27;m not sure how laziness would affect this. But I don&#x27;t want to be spreading FUD...)<p>2) The &quot;efficient&quot; implementation given at the bottom is just as inscrutable as any other quicksort implementation I&#x27;ve seen. More so because of the monadic code, single-letter variables (pr?) and opaque library function calls (unsafePartition?) being made. And I&#x27;m not even sure that it would work on a list, although since V.Vector appears to be a type class, perhaps list is an instance of it.<p>3) Both the efficient and inefficient implementations are concise in large part because of their use of library functions. This is often a good thing: Haskell provides a great way to abstract things because of its parametric and ad-hoc polymorphism, and allows for a lot of reusable code. But it comes at a cost too, which is that the actual instructions you&#x27;re giving to the machine are very far removed from what the computer is doing. Who knows how much code is <i>actually</i> executed, how deep the rabbit hole goes, to translate those beautiful 4 lines into actual machine instructions? With Java, it&#x27;s precisely visible what the machine is doing to execute your code. This is much less the case with Haskell.<p>I suppose you could say (broadly) that functional languages excel at expressing <i>what</i> your program should do, while imperative languages excel at expressing <i>how</i> your program should do it. There are cases when you care more about the former, and cases when you care more about the latter. The reason I take issue with the quicksort example, is that list-sorting is a case where you <i>definitely</i> care more about the <i>how</i> than the <i>what</i>.<p>-------------------<p>EDIT, since two people called me out on it: It was an overstatement on my part to say that it&#x27;s &quot;precisely visible&quot; what your Java code will translate to, but to suggest the two languages have the same degree of abstraction from the CPU is ridiculous. The code translation from Java to bytecode is quite straightforward, because most of the optimization occurs at runtime with JIT. There is a reasonably direct relationship between the code you write, the bytecode it gets translated into, and the instructions executed at runtime. At the end of the day, Java code consists of a series of instructions for the computer to follow, while on the other hand in Haskell, you aren&#x27;t even technically giving instructions at all -- you&#x27;re just writing equations. Compiled Haskell code is completely inscrutable.<p>Also, I should note that I am an enthusiastic Haskell hobbyist, and write it on almost a daily basis. Although I might not come across it here, I am a huge fan of the language; outside of the languages I use at work, by far the one I use most is haskell.",1399484736

The concept of the OASIS is neat, and the segments dealing with the nature of VR in society (education in VR, logging in to escape the reality of life in the &quot;stacks&quot;, the lengths to which the main character goes when dedicating his life and daily habits entirely toward the Quest). But it&#x27;s all wrapped up in a bunch of shallow 80&#x27;s references that made me feel like the author was insecure about the strength of his own ideas and needed a bunch of Family-Guy-esque name-dropping so the nerd demographic reading it could say &quot;Oh, I know that reference!&quot; When I read a book taking place in the future, I sort of hope that there&#x27;s something there about the future to explore rather than getting the sense that all culture and media just stopped in the end of the 20th century and the only thing that happened since was VR getting developed. Strikes me as reader/author wish fulfillment.\nThe protagonists weren&#x27;t likable, the villainous evil corporate anti-open-source drones were stunningly one-dimensional, the two Japanese brother characters felt like walking MY SAMURAI HONOR stereotypes, and the romance with Art3mis felt like getting the princess at the end of a game as a prize (which would be a neat parallel with the video game references were it not played straight). If I was younger when reading it I would have been more forgiving, but it all felt like a &quot;kids rule, grown-ups drool&quot; sort of plot.<p>It seems like, despite the protagonist&#x27;s fears about IOI turning the OASIS into a soul-less amusement park, that&#x27;s kind of what the OASIS already was in the story. There wasn&#x27;t much talk about players generating new worlds and new experiences -- most of the time characters were enjoying the pre-packaged &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, or &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; VR worlds, reliving existing ideas again and again. The gunter protagonists weren&#x27;t off creating fantastic new landscapes or generating culture, they were poring through the ruins of the old trying to find some arcane clue -- and I didn&#x27;t get the sense that they would be doing that if they didn&#x27;t have the Hunt to focus on.\nThese are interesting things to think about -- and definitely a worrisome part of dystopian visions of VR that turn the ultimate communication/creation tool into a trough full of pre-packaged feed for consumers -- but I don&#x27;t think that RPO&#x27;s author was attempting to focus on that. Rather, the sterile emptiness I felt from the OASIS seemed more a result of the author just not describing much that wasn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;just so&quot; for the plot.<p>There are a lot of neat VR ideas in it that I hope get more exposure, but it&#x27;s despite the nature of the book rather than because of it.",1399484205

And they&#x27;re going to make it look easy. What&#x27;s more, for the most part it <i>will</i> be easy.<p>The damning bit is that what SpaceX ends up doing will be the sort of thing that could have been done back in the &#x27;80s or maybe even the &#x27;70s. But nobody had the right combination of pragmatism and vision to make it happen. But they could have, and there were bread crumbs all along the way.<p>So why didn&#x27;t they? A lot of it ultimately comes down to a few factors. Group think and bureaucracy. And fads. Yup, fads. One problem that orbital aerospace has been constantly afflicted with is the coolness factor problem. When pushing new projects it can be difficult to do so unless there is some sort of coolness factor, some way in which the new project is demonstrably more advanced than previous generation efforts. This is anathema to actual progress because most progress comes from copying, perfecting, and incremental innovation. The coolness factor is how we ended up with Shuttle (so cool), and X-33/VentureStar (much, much cooler). But look at the Falcon 9, it&#x27;s just a 2 stage LOX/Kerosene booster, they&#x27;ve been building those since the &#x27;50s/&#x27;60s, it&#x27;s the definition of <i>uncool</i>. But what it lacks in coolness it more than makes up for in usefulness.<p>In terms of fads you can look to the Hydrogen rocket fad that still has a grip on a lot of engineers. LOX/LH2 undoubtedly has a very high Isp, and Isp is supremely important in the rocket equation. But it&#x27;s not everything, and LH2 has a crapload of very serious downsides when it comes to using it in rocketry, many of which add significant cost to the system. The Hydrogen fad is why the Shuttle had SRBs (because the SSMEs couldn&#x27;t generate enough thrust on their own to get off the pad) and thus is partially responsible for the Challenger disaster. It&#x27;s also responsible for the Delta IV, which is an extremely expensive launcher.<p>But back to breadcrumbs. They were there. In the early &#x27;90s the DC-X program demonstrated vertical takeoff/vertical landing was a feasible technology, and it did so using LOX/LH2 even. But the program was largely ignored because NASA was too dumb to see the promise of a reusable <i>stage</i>, since it wasn&#x27;t cool enough relative to the idea of an SSTO RLV (in the same year as the last flight of the DC-X NASA got the X-33 program rolling).<p>If NASA was just a little bit smarter and more practical it would have been easy to see the promise of the DC-X, easy to see the practicality of partial reusability, and easy to see the advantages of simpler launchers. But they didn&#x27;t. Instead they pursued cool idea after cool idea, dumping around a billion dollars into X-33 alone. And when their overly ambitious cool ideas didn&#x27;t pan out they ended up with nothing. And it was only through the comparative pragmatism of the defense department and the EELV program (which developed a couple boring 2-stage launchers) that the US had any reasonable launch capability whatsoever after the Shuttle program ended. Now it will be through the comparatively superior pragmatism (not to diminish the genius of SpaceX) that we&#x27;ll end up with even greater launch capability and unprecedented reusability.",1399484156

Just way out of whack.

7711449,comment,7710694,7711173,3,0,DanAndersen,,,"I agree that a distributed Web-like Metaverse is more likely to be interesting and more likely to succeed. The problem of a concept like the Metaverse is that certain elements of it work great as part of a science fiction story -- like the presence of &quot;physical constraints&quot; where property exists in some absolute place on a virtual grid, and users have to actually move their avatars along that terrain to get from point A to point B. This is fun for a story where the hero must quickly get to some point but time is of the essence, but as a real-world concept it&#x27;s absurd. I think part of what makes the Web so successful is the concept of the hyperlink and the URL, being able to jump so quickly from place to place.<p>I consider imposed physical limitations on a meta-VR space to be like DRM. It&#x27;s an attempt to slap existing limitations of reality (scarcity, in the case of DRM) onto a medium that no longer needs it. Why should I have to take a virtual train to get from one VR space to another? Why should there be &quot;lots&quot; where people have to pay to get the best &quot;locations&quot; to put their VR space? It reminds me of the old GeoCities sites and the short-lived concept of neighborhoods, which failed to realize that people don&#x27;t browse the Web by metaphorically walking linearly along a sidewalk, staring at each storefront in turn. We jump, we &quot;teleport,&quot; and that&#x27;s the strength of the Web.<p>You might be interested in the Janus VR (formerly known as Firebox) project: <a href=""http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/firebox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/firebox/</a> It&#x27;s an attempt at a sort of VRML-like markup for defining webpages with VR content. I&#x27;ve played around with it a bit in my Rift, and it&#x27;s neat to have the discoverability of virtual browsing but without the constraints of physicality: links are just doors you can open into virtual spaces, and you can always pop open an address bar to go somewhere new.<p>In short: VR lets us transcend limitations in where we can go, but the Web let us transcend limitations in how we interact with the world. Individual VR experiences can be whatever people want, but a meta-VR system must take into account the simple fact that humans can now &quot;teleport.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a nice video that shows what Janus VR is like: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jva-855nLvM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jva-855nLvM</a>",1399483257

They are strawmen for manual memory management though, because the vast majority of manual memory management (when done carefully) avoid malloc/free.<p>Instead, you embed allocations within each other when possible. i.e: Every time you have a bunch of objects with (near) identical lifetimes, you allocate a single struct that embeds all of the allocations within it (and amortize the allocation cost).<p>More-over, you use a slub allocator for that particular struct size. Often, you have hard limits on the allocation due to external reasons, meaning you can use a static array with a simple free-list to manage it.<p>Then, doing a singly-linked list insert/delete is <i>extremely</i> cheap. It is slightly more expensive than a GC pointer bump to allocate, but vastly cheaper to free. Also, it has far better cache locality.<p>Additionally, the avoidance of indirections and pointer-chasing incurred by doing lots of tiny allocations that indirectly refer to each other also helps cache locality significantly.<p>There are some rare cases where you want GC-style memory management, simply because the lifetimes are too complex, but in my experience, it is quite a rare situation. Even when you do, you still want to make use of allocations&#x27; aggregations which is not possible in most GC&#x27;d languages.<p>For the vast majority of cases, manual MM via coarse-grained refcounting (where large objects pay for a refcount), and slub allocators are used with allocation embedding, you&#x27;ll have far cheaper MM overhead as well as better cache behavior.",1399483230

Usually because they use high chamber pressures in the 3000+ psi range.  The merlin series runs a mere 1000 psi.<p>It does win one performance metric of thrust to weight.  Little surprise because they might give up 10% of thrust (err, whatever) by running at a lower pressure but obviously running a third of the chamber pressure the engine walls are going to be about a third the thickness and a third the mass, so its a huge win for thrust to weight, knock down the nominator by 10% and the denominator by a factor of 3 and you win.  So they do hold a record in this category.<p>Also lower pressures imply lower temps imply lower thermal load, lower heat shock, lower thermal distortion and thermal related stress on startup/shutdown.  It inherently should always outperform a Russian engine WRT restart / reusability unless something has gone very wrong.<p>Two things make engines un-reusable.  One is simple runtime.  It seems intuitively obvious that a 1000 psi turbopump is cheaper and more reliable than a 3000 psi turbopump, all things being equal.  The other thing that kills reusability is thermal shock effects where need something to be &quot;X&quot; thick to handle the forces and pressures, but the exterior or one side heats up much faster than the inside creating enormous stresses.  So low pressure means low temps",1399482824

They chose an overly ambitious design which congress, rightfully in my opinion, balked at. They tried to skip technological generations, which is a nono in R&D and always a very expensive and risky prospect. Instead of coming up with a new idea they doubled down on their fantasy, turning the Shuttle idea into a political juggernaut. And they got their way, they got massive buy in into the Shuttle, by selling it to everyone as the be-all-end-all of everyone&#x27;s space dreams. It would be all things to all customers: NASA manned spaceflight, NASA space science, commercial satellite companies, even the military. But part of the cost of that political juggernaut was imposition of additional design elements, which brought more compromises. But on the other hand with so many people on board the program had political inevitability and was almost impossible to shut down. The Shuttle would already have been a bit of a turkey relative to its promises but those additional compromises made it one of the most expensive and troublesome launchers in history. But those compromises came about because of the unwillingness of the Shuttle&#x27;s original backers to consider other options, they made those deals and those compromises and they were forced to live with the consequences.",1399482784

I&#x27;m guessing that any non-trivial program requires a priori knowledge from the programmer&#x27;s mind to properly inform the compiler which variables do what and when.<p>I also think the thesis is wrong, but i&#x27;d put it differently. I suspect that in many cases, a sufficiently smart compiler could analyse a program and assign plausible classifications to every variable. However, i suspect that there will be some cases which are not - there is no set of classifications which can be assigned which will conform to the rules. Inevitably, these would be exactly the cases you actually hit when writing real programs. In other words, i think this ends up looking a bit like the halting problem.<p>As a thought experiment, imagine Rust, but without any of the memory management classifications on variables: no tildes, ampersands, or single quotes. You could compile and execute this with fairly conventional garbage-collected memory management semantics. But you could also try to assign memory management classifications to every variable, and the compile it as Rust. The number of possible assignments over the whole program is clearly finite - there are a finite number of variables, a finite number of pointer types, a finite number of lifetimes, and so a finite number of arrangements of all those. Large, but finite. So you could, in principle, enumerate them by brute force.<p>If you took an existing, correct, Rust program, erased all the classifications, and fed it into this brute force re-classifying compiler, it would eventually find a legal classification, and compile it. It might be the original classification, or it might not. This means that there isn&#x27;t a requirement for &quot;a priori knowledge from the programmer&#x27;s mind&quot;. Any program which <i>could</i> be given a plausible classification can be given one automatically.<p>However, i think there is no such certainty that it would find a legal classification for a arbitrary program. Indeed, i suspect it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to find a counterexample: you just need a Rust program which doesn&#x27;t compile, and can&#x27;t be fixed purely by changing memory management classifications. Anyone want to give that a go?",1399482682

All those lines of code that vanished were really whole concepts and ideas which could vanish as well.<p>Of late, my style has been refined by working with theorem provers which make the ultimate connection. Recursion is absolutely nothing more than mathematical induction. Each recursive call is just you invoking the inductive hypothesis.<p>What that connection really drives home is that when writing a recursive definition you need to do so very few things. First, you need to make sure your definition has a good foundation—you must list all of the conditions where it terminates and ensure that they truly found and support the algorithm/proof. Then you must write the inductive engine that will burn away whatever inputs you receive down to the foundation you just made.<p>The release is in noticing that those inductive engines can be primed on the very tiniest actions—and those tiny actions are all you, the implementer, are responsible for.<p>When writing your inductive step consider only the things that are novel about <i>this case</i>. If I&#x27;m working with an input list and inducting on `cons` then all I must do is consider what happens to the head and tail of the list. Everything else will be handled by the turning of the inductive engine.<p>Now a good algorithm just feels like someone walked me into a room with a gigantic domino structure.

The cost of that standing army plus the limitations of flight rate imposed by the duration of refurbishment operations meant that ultimately every Shuttle flight ended up costing about $1.1 billion. Contrast that with the cost of building a new orbiter, which was around $2 billion.<p>This was a huge problem for the Shuttle program from day one, because the huge ongoing costs meant that NASA manned spaceflight were locked into the Shuttle system and incapable of budgeting for developing improvements or alternatives. And indeed, they ended up stupidly flying more or less a prototype design for 3 decades.<p>But that sort of insanity isn&#x27;t a universal problem for reusability. Indeed, the idea that any sane entity outside of deeply entrenched government bureaucracy would embrace a &quot;reusable&quot; system where each flight cost 1/2 as much as brand new hardware is a bit of a stretch on its own.

SpaceX already manufactures reusable F9 first stages, they are just ordinary F9 first stages plus landing legs. They cost a few million dollars to produce, not billions, and SpaceX pumps out several of them a year. SpaceX is planning for a very low cost of operations for reusability. They&#x27;ll land the stage, retrieve it with a vehicle, bring it into a warehouse where it can be run through some tests then assembled into a full launcher, fueled, and relaunched. There is a very low cap on the costs for that operation, because if it starts costing more than pumping out new stages then SpaceX will stop doing it. So there&#x27;s no &quot;trap&quot; possible for SpaceX. If they get reusability working then they&#x27;ll just have that much more manufacturing and R&D capacity plus profit margin for working on the next generation of rocket.",1399482053

Especially when you complicate the design to an extreme degree to achieve reusability, thus causing that one rocket to cost a ton of money to build and a ton of money to refurbish.<p>Where he gets it wrong, I think, is that Falcon 9R is not a pure reusable system. It&#x27;s an expendable system that&#x27;s been lightly modified for reusability. This is important because it means that the rocket is still cheap to build and cheap to refurbish.<p>Look at the Shuttle program: they built four orbiters initially, then a fifth as a replacement after one was destroyed, and that&#x27;s it. They operated these things for <i>decades</i>.<p>Compare with the Falcon 9R program: they built, launched, and deliberately threw away one already. They&#x27;ll do this several more times. The vehicles are cheap enough that they can intentionally lose hardware as part of the test program. The vehicles are capable enough that they can get <i>paid</i> to test them by still using them to launch payloads into orbit while doing it.<p>The Shuttle had to fly dozens of times a year just to break even compared to the cost of building new expendable rockets. They could never come anywhere close to that. This is the sort of thing that M. Bonnal is referring to, and it makes sense in that context. The difference is that Falcon 9R costs little more than a regular Falcon 9 to build, and on the second launch it will already be past breakeven and saving money. Perhaps it can be reused 40 times, but unlike the Shuttle, it doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be reused 40 times to justify an extremely high initial cost and extremely high ongoing overhead.",1399482006

Replacing a half million routers across the country to remove the previous technical constraints isn&#x27;t an easy or fast thing to do: the hardware will be obsolete before the implementation is finished.<p>Think about everything that goes into this: they can&#x27;t just pick a piece of hardware off of Amazon; they have to review proposals for companies to manufacture and support the hardware over their 10-year lifespan. They then have to train their employees on them, develop migration plans, rollback plans, schedule maintenance windows, etc. These migration plans often involve significant changes to CPE configurations, which also need to be planned, tested, implemented and trained for.<p>It&#x27;s a huge infrastructure. It costs a lot of money to make any significant change. And you seem to be confusing Ethernet with a last-mile technology; it&#x27;s more of a last hundred feet technology. A lot of the effort over the last 10 years has been spent moving the telecom-owned equipment closer to consumer homes so that faster speeds can be obtained over shorter cable runs. As the length of a cable run increases, so does interference and you have to dial down speeds as a result (this is even true of fiber, albeit to a lesser extent).",1399482006

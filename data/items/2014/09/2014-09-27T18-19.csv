Consider this quote from his popular book (the title of which is often truncated):<p>&quot;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life&quot;<p>“At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated.

The idea was that you could write scripts that would build statically-linked versions of binaries, such as Apache HTTPD [2]. Then, you could run a command like:<p><pre><code>    whack install git+https://github.com/mwilliamson/whack-package-apache2-mod-php5 apps/apache2\n</code></pre>\nto install to any location you wanted, and the installation would still work if you mv&#x27;d the entire directory somewhere else, or even onto another distribution (provided it didn&#x27;t have an older libc).<p>I never really the pushed the idea further since I think doing a decent job requires a lot of time and effort, and it solves something which is a minor annoyance for me, rather than causing significant pain. I do still use it for when I need to quickly get a WordPress server for development up and running since it&#x27;s one command to deploy from scratch.<p>It feels to me like there&#x27;s lots of scope for something similar to apt-get that builds and installs static binaries (or, at the very least, lets you install to different directories without root, similar to, say, virtualenv for Python or RVM for Ruby).<p>EDIT: actually, from a quick glance, it seems like Gentoo Prefix [3], as mentioned by ryao, allows you to install things as you normally would on a Gentoo machine, but without being root and with a prefix of your choosing.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mwilliamson/whack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mwilliamson/whack</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/mwilliamson/whack-package-apache2-mod-php5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mwilliamson/whack-package-apache2-mod-php...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/</a>",1411843697

8377776,comment,8377345,8377345,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"While the article isn&#x27;t wrong, it&#x27;s increasingly my belief that &quot;messaging&quot; is something of a misnomer, because it&#x27;s used to refer to two rather one different concepts: Events and jobs.<p>We&#x27;ve been using RabbitMQ for messaging for a long time. Some messages are purely reactive: An object was changed, so some other subscribing application needs to react by updating its data structures to reflect the change. This is an event.<p>Other messages represent jobs. Jobs are tasks that are queued up for processing. Processing photos, for example, is a classic job.<p>Jobs don&#x27;t fall that well into the RabbitMQ/AMQP framework because it&#x27;s designed for messaging and is, despite support for things like durability and dead-letter exchanges, largely about ephemeral data. RabbitMQ is pretty good with events; its excellent routing support, for example, makes it trivial to build simple a pub/sub architecture, and it&#x27;s pretty fast.<p>But one big difference between events and jobs is that events are &quot;fan out&quot; (every logical type of listener gets routed one copy of each event, because they may be subscribing for different reasons), whereas jobs are directed (there is only processor that can do the job, and there is always just one processor working on a single job at any given time).<p>Another difference is that a job can be in various states. With events, you don&#x27;t care about completion: A consumed event has been consumed. But with jobs it&#x27;s terribly useful to track the final status of everything. Jobs should be pausable and long-running jobs should be able to report on their progress (&quot;34% of subjects mutated&quot;) along the way. Jobs should arguably be capable of being re-run, even if they succeeded. The performance of jobs -- how long they took, how long they had to wait, their failure rate, the rate of their various progress metrics (516 photos processed), etc. -- is something you want to track and aggregate.<p>But as it happens, relational databases excel at the sort of stuff you need for jobs. I haven&#x27;t made any decisions yet, but I&#x27;m really itching to create a job management app on top of Postgres, unless I can find an existing system that is equally stable. I&#x27;ve played with the idea of a hybrid system: Register jobs in Postgres, use RabbitMQ as the trigger mechanism. But this puts a burden on the processor, which now has to use two APIs.<p>(On a related note, a big pet peeve of mine is how flaky RabbitMQ is. Being used to working with Postgres, which is famously stable, RabbitMQ is easily the least reliable piece of software in our application stack. We lose messages every week due to network instability and RabbitMQ bugs. There&#x27;s something to be said for Postgres&#x27; master/slave design here. It may not be a cool clustered Erlang project, but it just <i>works</i>.)",1411842720

In a previous job I researched brominated flame retardants and it is well documented that they cause developmental disruptions, cancer, and reproductive toxicity. One of the main dangers is that they are not chemically bonded to the plastic and foam that they are added to, like in your couch cushions. This means they get into dust, which is particularly a hazard for babies crawling on the floor.<p>The laws are also outdated and not very practical- in California, which has some of the most rigorous regulations on environmental health, the test for a flame retardant cushion is to hold a candle to a piece of foam for 12 seconds.<p>The Chicago Tribune did a series on the tobacco industry&#x27;s role in getting brominated flame retardants into furniture, which I recommend reading for some context on the current US regulations: <a href=""http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/flames/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/flames/index.html</a><p>Edited to add links to some studies:\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866688/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866688/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569691/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569691/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3349420/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3349420/</a>",1411841807

While not good practice by any measure, this means that PCI bus does not have to be physically an linear bus, but works with arbitrary trees that does not contain excessively long paths (see for example aftermarket right-angle multi-slot PCI brackets for SFF and rackmount systems, that bus most of PCI signals for multiple slots together and only break out REQ#, GNT# and IDSEL through few wires to other original board slots).",1411841203

However, I&#x27;ll submit that the intellectual world is larger than integration and differentiation.  I&#x27;ll further suggest that there is a world of difference between understanding enough calculus to integrate and differentiate, and understanding calculus in sufficient depth to apply its principles to problems and in settings that do not afford simple template matching -- I wrote an integration/differentiation package in Scheme my freshman year, but would not claim that it understands calculus.<p>This is one of the ways in which a good teacher and a bad teacher can vary by an order of magnitude.

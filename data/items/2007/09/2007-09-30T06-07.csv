That's nothing for any of the multi-millionaires that roam this site.  There should definitely be some kind of criteria to determine whether a person is promising (such as what they've done on their own time), but besides that I don't see any problem with the idea.",1191134963

61239,comment,61080,61205,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""They would do so for security reasons. Vista runs apps in user mode.""<p>That, for me, became so annoying after a few days I turned it off.  (I do keep running into inexplicable instances where I am not allowed to delete or move files I created without engaging in much unintuitive file property manipulations, so the machine still seems to be boss of things.)<p>Vista is amazingly annoying in so many little ways.  I suspect that is true of all OS, and people just become numb to them, but Vista seems keen on reminding me what ""opinionated software"" is all about.  <p>So far the only thing that keeps me from replacing Vista with XP is the pre-installed Media Center software.<p>(I already set up the dual boot for Kubuntu, for Serious Computer Usage. :))",1191133437

61234,comment,61080,61080,0,0,hello_moto,,,"I use Vista (on my MacBook) more often than OSX lately. Somehow all MacBook hardware features work (except the camera/mic). The keyboard, tab and scroll down all work fine.<p>Putty works better for me compare to the default xterm that shipped with OSX. The ""just work"" phrase doesn't seem to reflect that based on my own experience. <p>For development, Vista has pretty much everything while OSX has almost everything minus .NET (yes I know there's Mono but I don't need Mono, I need Microsoft .NET and its tools Express or Full-package).<p>I prefer Office 2007 than Office 2004 or iWork. Outlook feels my need. <p>At home (PC desktop) I use Media Center frequently. Front Row isn't anywhere near. Oh, I never use Front Row because it doesn't do much. <p>I prefer to use Windows Live Gallery than iPhoto because WLG is simpler (for me) than iPhoto. <p>Overall, Vista is smooth for me. My machine is a budget one; it took $450 CAD to build it. Here's the spec:<p>ASRock (or ASUS I forgot) mobo with built-in vid-card
AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual-core 4400+ 2.30 GHz
Kingston RAM 2GB DDR2 800MHz
Samsung 160GB SATA2
Haupauge WinTV PVR 150<p>Windows Media Center detects the card with no problem at all and it fetched all cable channels. You could also watch tons of clips from MTV via Windows Media Center. 
While I understand the real-world situation that the author describes, there's no need to hate something that you've never tried. ",1191132388

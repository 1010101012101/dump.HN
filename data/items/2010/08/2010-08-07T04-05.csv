1583079,comment,1582231,1582441,0,0,flatulent1,,,"I suspect there's more of the early HP spirit at Agilent than at HP.  Somehow when Compaq got the HP computer division, they got the name too, and the very cool test equipment part of HP got the new name Agilent.  (This is my recollection, I'm sure the wikipedia has a much more detailed history)<p>I chuckle when I see the old tube-type HP gear as movie props.  The HP 330 series distortion analyzer has had many appearances including on the wall in the presidents office in Battlestar Galactica.  HP and Tektronix certainly have had many years as favorites for much of their test gear.  Much older equipment is still in use.  It's an eye opener to see the circuit boards with all the traces covered in gold.  Not just an edge connector... the entire boards.
Time to dust off my favorite early piece, the HP 300 Harmonic Wave Analyzer...<p><a href=""http://www.kennethkuhn.com/hpmuseum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kennethkuhn.com/hpmuseum/</a>",1281157061

I just meant that the argument Smullyan presents does not involve probabilities, random variables, distributions, expected values, etc. (This can be verified by reading it again and checking those concepts do not appear. ;)).<p>I don't find your argument convincing either, maybe it helps to remove the ""undefined variable"" you complain about:<p>The first envelope chosen has some definite amount of money, let's say $10 (but the same argument can be adapted to any amount). Then the other envelope must have either $5 or $20. If it is $5, switching loses you $5. If it is $10, switching gains you $10.<p>Imagine actually doing this experiment with the two envelopes, opening the first and seeing $10. Wouldn't you say the other contains either $5 or $20?",1281156761

1583053,comment,1582402,1582402,0,0,robryan,,,"There are a couple of things I can get from attending uni that I can't get from learning online.<p>- Focus - Sitting at the computer it is very easily to be distracted trying to pick up a challenging new concept. I find this even more true about things I don't derive any immediate benefit from, as in it is easier to concentrate on learning a library I'm going to use in a freelance project than say an obscure statistical model for a class. Sitting in the lecture give me that chance to clear my head from most distractions and focus on the content.<p>- Mindset - I head into uni, it usually gets me in the right mindset for learning and completing tasks. I don't get that sitting at home.<p>I would also add the guidance of some lecturers/ supervisors but this point really depends where you are. I can't say in my own experience this couldn't have been replaced online although their are moments when having such experienced teachers can help.<p>Edit- I would also add that these issues could be solved by getting together at a co-working space with some like minded others. I guess a hybrid model like that could have some merit, the educational institute acts as a network to connect like minded people for online study. Maybe they could also have a staff member that has a hands off role and just answers questions over email for a much reduced fee over the traditional system.",1281155106

1583050,comment,1582219,1582219,0,0,trominos,,,"The flaw in the argument for switching comes in its second line:<p>""1. I denote by A the amount in my selected envelope.<p><i>2. The probability that A is the smaller amount is 1/2, and that it is the larger amount is also 1/2.</i>""<p>If we're gonna be taking expected values we need to assume that the monetary amounts in the two envelopes are generated from a probability distribution on the nonnegative reals. Then the probability distribution for the amount of money in the smaller envelope is going to be some kind of curve (call it S), and obviously the probability distribution for the amount of money in the bigger envelope is going to be the same curve only ""stretched out"" and ""squashed"" by a factor of two (we'll call it B).<p>Now if you say ""my envelope contains exactly A dollars,"" you can tell what the probability is that your envelope is the smaller envelope by comparing the relative heights of the two curves at the value A; let's denote these heights by S(A) and B(A). It is certainly <i>possible</i> that the two heights are the same, in which case it's fifty-fifty that you have the bigger or smaller envelope, the rest of the logic holds, and you should indeed switch, getting an expected return of 5/4 * A.<p>But it is obviously impossible that <i>in general</i> the two heights are the same for any given A, because then the two probability distributions are the same -- and that can't be true, because B is a squashed, stretched-out version of S, and for a variety of fairly obvious reasons you can't squash and stretch out a finite curve on the positive reals and get the same curve (unless that curve is 0 everywhere). And so we can't conclude that <i>in general</i> you should switch, which is good because if you're not allowed to look at the money before you switch it obviously doesn't matter whether you do or not (unless the people running the game are messing with you).",1281154888

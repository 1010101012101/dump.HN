I constructed my comment to also address the same arguments that have popped up in the ""MIT switched to Python"" discussions.<p>I've taught intro to Java labs to undergrads, and I did get questions on the scaffolding required. I answered their question, but also told them they don't need to understand that now. I'd rather not have to do that.",1249304378

739074,comment,738435,738867,0,0,scott_s,,,"I suspect you're abusing the term ""theoretical computer science,"" which is surprisingly common in this crowd. I assume you actually mean basic computer science concepts relevant to programming.<p>To address your question, Java abstracts away memory management - not just dynamic memory allocation, but common off-by-one mistakes will result in a runtime exception. It's possible, but unlikely, that you'll get a segfault in C. You probably own the memory just past your array, and you're more likely to get strange errors because you're invisibly overwriting values.<p>If you want to focus on algorithmic thinking, and not the realities of a computer, this is a win. As another posted pointed out above, I think other languages are better suited for this, but Java is still valid.",1249304139

739069,comment,738990,738995,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I was logging in to make that same comment. A default judgment is when the defendant doesn't show up in court. The judge didn't look at the merits of the case and find in favor of Sethi. A default judgment just says that the plaintiff wins because the defendant didn't show up.<p>Here's the key part from the second link (emphasis added):<p>> The purpose of this letter is to inform you that <i>TechCrunch and Mr. Arrington will not, as is their right, submit to the jurisdiction of the English courts in this matter</i>. As we have previously informed you in our letters of March 18 and May 17, 2009, <i>TechCrunch is not susceptible to the jurisdiction of the English courts and the proper forum for your client’s claims would be the State of California</i>, which is the location where the words were both written and published in accordance with the prevailing local laws and standards. As a result, any vindication that your client seeks should properly be sought in the courts of the appropriate California jurisdiction. Accordingly, defendants will not file an Acknowledgment of Service in the High Court of Justice. As we have previously informed you, <i>any judgment that your client may obtain in this matter will be unenforceable in the United States</i>.<p>I've heard of this happening, but I don't know how it actually plays out. Would the UK detain an American citizen with a default judgment against him? I guess every country's laws on how to handle civil claims against foreign nationals visiting the country differ... interesting stuff, never really thought about it before. Would be curious to have a solicitor or lawyer with knowledge of the law weigh in.<p>Edit: I looked at the zdnet link - it's got some information, but looks a bit off to me. Arrington and Techcrunch not defending in England when they didn't do anything in England isn't running from the law. The reason jurisdictions exist is so your company doesn't get sued in a foreign country where you have no staff, no offices, took no actions, and didn't do any business. The article goes on to say:<p>> By default, the judgment recognizes that Arringon/Interserve are in a position of power where what they say carries weight to a large audience and can be considered damaging.<p>Pretty sure that's incorrect: The court stamped a piece of paper saying that the defendants weren't there, they didn't make a ruling about positions of power in international media in the internet age. I'd still be curious to hear someone with knowledge of the law weigh in - I can understand not wanting to defend a suit in a foreign country that you don't have operations in, and I don't think the English jurisdiction would apply. But does that mean Arrington could get arrested in England? Interesting to think about this case.",1249303960

The glass landed on concrete 30 m below. What happened to the glass when it landed? he then dropped a rubber ball; what happened to the ball when it landed?<p>Or a simple biology question: A woman wanted to breed striped cats. She had a male cat and a female cat. Both cats were coloured black all over. She painted white stripes on both cats, then got them to have sex. Is this likely to produce striped kittens?<p>These are very easy questions, yet to answer them one needs to understand important concepts about science.

739043,comment,737616,738984,0,0,IsaacL,,,"Thanks for the reply.<p>Just looked up at Leeds on Wikipedia - I'd assumed it was a fairly mid-range institution (and so I thought there'd be other institutions the same or worse, but many which were better). Just found out it's in the Russell Group. Christ. I (partially) retract my earlier respones.<p>I study CS (just finished first year) in the UK at a institution that usually places in the top 10... now you mention it, a lot of students do match those described by you and others. However, it's easy to ignore these people, since they never go to lectures (I have friends on other courses who say they attend on average 1 lecture a term...) It's trite, but with university, I feel you get out what you put in.<p>The opportunity to mix with the people who are bright and motivated (and they do exist) is great, as is having a library full of free programming books. For every student who only goes to party, there's one in the CS building late at night writing a Scheme parser in Haskell. (OK, the ratio's probably more like 3:1, but you get my drift).<p>On the other hand, I feel like I've learned about as much from pursuing independent projects than I have from my course, though the resources on campus make such projects easier.<p>BTW, a large part of me is thinking about dropping out of university at some stage and startup a startup - read too much pg - so I've been thinking about the value of university lately.<p>CS is a bit of an odd subject in this regard - with a lot of subjects^, I'd guess a majority of students don't expect their degree to be useful in their future careers (how many history grads become history teachers?), so it's understandable that many would just see their degree as a career ticket. I do actually hope to learn useful stuff on my course, but I'm not sure if I'd learn more by dropping out and starting up.<p>*Exceptions I can think of - Law, Medicine, and possibly foreign languages, Engineering, and Economics.

739039,comment,738435,738854,0,0,Goladus,,,"Actually I'd argue that with C, you have to start managing memory manually before you even get to malloc.  The abstraction advantage of Java over C (not that I think Java is necessarily a better intro language) is that you can generally explain the syntax in abstract concepts and then use it like you'd expect.  With C, it's far more likely to encounter scenarios that don't fit a simple model of understanding.<p>For example, unless you're concerned with specific performance issues, you're not likely to care how a string is implemented in Java.  It's difficult to use strings in C without understanding memory.  Without understanding when strings are mutable and when they aren't, what null-terminated means, how ""%s"" works, and such you will quickly run into some unexpected behavior and will likely just trial and error until you get something that seems to work.  When you understand that C is a syntax for allocating and manipulating memory, it tends to make a lot more sense.",1249301499

I competed at last year's International Physics Olympiad (Viet Nam), who won? China, as usual.<p>China starts preparation for the competition when their participants are just 8; they work ~16 hours a day on physics problems. The result? Winning with ease. You have, I all presume, read Gladwell's latest book. The Chinese education system squeezes the 10,000 hours required for expertise in before the children are 18. I'm currently [one of] the best physics students in the UK and I'd pay anything to have had an uprising like that, instead mine was consumed with PC games, and posting on forums.<p>The evidence I have shown can only be used to defend the proposition that: ""The Chinese education system is best for those students with a natural skill in certain areas; i.e., physics"". It might be argued that while it has these benefits the negatives - I reference the article in question - might outweigh the former.<p>I hate to go all reprogenetic on you. But my argument would go something like the following:<p>(1) A productive society is one with experts.\n(2) Expertise is only accomplished with relentless practice.\n(C) The most productive society will be accomplished if citizens are made to constantly work at their discipline.<p>There will, of course, be a transition stage in which those that lack real expertise are weeded out; but, I'm ashamed to say, that seems the most productive society.<p>Until then I will carry on working on my physics/philosophy 16 hours a day - I only wish I'd been forced to start earlier.",1234745475

482503,comment,482257,482257,0,0,azharcs,,,"After reading this article, All I can say is Indian education is very much identical. Some kids here are pushed even more than this Chinese kid; a kid sister of my friend goes to private tuition so that she could pass the entrance test of another private tuition which takes in less students and trains them to write and pass the entrance exam of a reputed college in India (so in simple words, she is going through two levels of tuitions to get into another tuition which she might go 4-5 years later).<p>Every other week I read in newspaper that a school or college kid killed himself/herself because they failed or got lesser marks than their peers. The most recent I read was a girl killed herself because she got 4 marks lesser than the topper of her class. It is scary and it is only getting worse day by day.<p>I have actually thought a lot about the reason “Why Parents are pushing their kids to the wall”, it is certainly not job uncertainty (there are plenty of outsourced jobs here and you can see almost anyone who is slightly not retarded getting one). The only answer I got was “Most of the parents in third-world countries lack good Identities” because they are in some jobs which are not very happy or proud of and the only way for them to escape from their ‘past or present’ is to change their future which they think is in the hands of their kids and not theirs. They constantly hear of stories of kids who studied well, got a job in some company and bought his parents house (which if he/she is lucky enough to hold on to the job might own it in next 20 years). As I have seen most of the pushy parents are highly incompetent who actually believe that their life is over, they can’t change it because they missed opportunities when they were young. A real person would go achieve what he wants at any age irrespective of anything else but pushy parents are not that because they are betting on their kids and that is much easier.<p>The other part of the problem is housewives (I am not sexist); this is a group which actually doesn’t have an identity. If you have ever been near one, most of their sentences start with “My son/daughter is…” most of these sentences end with an achievement of their kids which are incidentally better than other housewives kids. Now the housewives who were humiliated in the conversation go home force their kids to do well in whatever they do. It is certainly not limited to studies; it can be anything jumping a fence, throwing a ball or anything else. At the end of the day, their kid has to be better than other kids. It is kind of like playing a MMORPG where they want their avatar to be better than others and they want their avatars to level up faster so that they can fight bigger battles. So the problem is certainly not the education system, it is actually the society (housewives and people who are not happy with their jobs). So my solution would be think about the kids later, create jobs for housewives (idle minds are devil's workshop, they are the clear example of it). Keep the housewives busy and you would automatically see an improvement in kids who are back to being creative and independent like they always were.<p>Sorry for 600 words long rant, I am just pissed with how things are going on here right now. It actually took me an hour to write this. :)",1234744498

While part of this is for scalability and performance, it offers Twitter a way to screen what sort of services people build on top of the data stream. So if they didn't like an analytics service as a competitor, they could just turn them off.<p>There's integration with gnip as well, but I don't know what the exact features or limitations it has. Again, though, that feed is controlled by Twitter, so they could perhaps direct gnip to cut off a service they don't like.<p>If you're curious, there are periodic discussions at the Twitter development google group on the effect of API limits. Sometimes these include ideas for reducing the number of API calls required to do something:\n<a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk</a><p>That being said, Twitter has enough capital to acquire companies. Summize is now search.twitter.com, for example. Would not be surprised if some of that most recent $35MM is earmarked for buying companies that provide the next ""big"" twitter-driven service, whether that's analytics or something else. I'd guess they would try to go that route first, rather than take the bad PR from terminating a competitor.",1234744013

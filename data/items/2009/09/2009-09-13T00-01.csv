819654,comment,819532,819532,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"This video appears to contain two mistakes:<p>- Since the second half of the piece contains so many short notes, the measures are physically longer on paper than the earlier measures, even though each half takes the same amount of time to play.  When the piece is broken into two halves, the animation is forced to put the breakpoint partway into the ""short note"" portion to make both ""sides"" (a misnomer, I know) the same length.<p>- The reverse playback version would, I'd think, be playing the notes ""upside down"" to work right.  That is, notes that were low should be played high, and vice versa.  I'd actually have to cut out and read sheet music on a real moebius strip to confirm this, however.  (The video only gave one camera angle of the strip.)",1252802675

819650,comment,819449,819606,0,0,Locke1689,,,"There's a small explanation here of what he meant: <a href=""http://www.robertgraboyes.com/writings_files/Bank%20at%20the%20End.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robertgraboyes.com/writings_files/Bank%20at%20the...</a>. His point definitely seems to be more intelligible after reading that article, but he seems to have a very limited definition of time travel. First, it must allow travel both ways. Second, one must be able to change the past. Third, the changed past must be the same as <i>our</i> past (Think of each new time travel instance as a new stack frame, with the stack variables being history. If one were to go back in time and change the past, one could create a new ""stack frame"" that leaves the history intact in its own timeline.)<p>However, one doesn't need a rather weak economic argument for the impossibility of time travel -- analyzing a light cone shows that causality will break down at speeds greater than that of light. Thus, traveling greater than the speed of light is equivalent to time travel. Using the Lorentz factor, we can trivially derive the fact that achieving a speed greater than that of light for a particle with finite mass requires an infinite amount of energy -- thus, time travel is impossible (assuming Einstein's Theory of Relativity is correct, which we are pretty damn certain about).",1252802461

And some soft SF writers, like Le Guin, do have a strong background in social sciences, and do write things that at least glancingly cover economics.<p>But the best example I can think of is Barnes's _A Million Open Doors_, set in a world that has just been exposed to a disruptive new technology.

It's been a long time since I was in school but back then every homework assignment was 100% what we covered that day. So if the ""lessons"" became unclear many folks just got further and further behind and for many there was no recovering at some point because the teachers never wanted to deviate from their schedule. Btillys 1/3 1/3 1/3 structure really resonates with me because I can imagine I would feel confident and never get in over my head as the complexity of the work escalates. (And if I fell behind I could use his 10 minute improvisational time to get clear) But back to the confidence, Video Games Designers want the player to be challenged but also to feel confident and of course this balance has to remain throughout all levels of the game. Video Game Designers have long used MC's work to help them incorporate this balance. So, yes I do believe the relationship between ability and challenge is part of MC's agenda- there is more, of course. It is my understanding that Video Games are the most common contact most people usually have with MC's work.<p>I made a connection between the successful feeling of playing video games with the successful learning experiences in Btillys class's and it would be interesting if Btilly is aware of MC's work or if he had ever thought of what he does as MCesque. In closing, I think you and I are saying the same thing here. Thanks for the comment..",1252802431

That may or may not be true. Getting into a debate with an external project about what should or shouldn't be the correct way to fix/change the external projects code can be a huge drain on time and mental energy. You can't fault a group for deciding not to bother.<p>Not to mention that if you become the person responsible for a piece of an external project you are suddenly not just supporting your use of that piece you are supporting everyone else's use of that piece. That leads to more debating/discussion about the right way to do it. If you have to find a way to scale fast it might actually in the long run be less time to just write it yourself for your specific needs not an entire communities needs who have different scaling issues than you and different goals. Many times One size does not fit all and convincing someone else of that is just too time consuming to try.<p>The author did bring up an interesting point about friendfeed developers not even trying to communicate though so I can understand what prompted him to write the article.",1252802324

I went (partially) through the mortgage process as a self employed (or homeless, as far as the banks are concerned) individual, and it was a nightmare.  I accidentally became employed about a year ago, and we opted to buy a house three months ago to take advantage of the fact that we could land a mortgage without jumping through too many hoops.

Normally, people were awake when it was light and slept when it was dark.  When camping, I normally wake at the crack of dawn and go to sleep pretty early after sunset.  At home, when not working (which means without a fixed schedule) I tend to sleep from 4 AM to noon.  When working I can adapt fairly easily to any working shift, but without the external focus I always drift back to the 4 AM to noon.  I have tried to maintain other schedules (as I have mentioned previously on HN posts on sleeping), but they never work out for very long.<p>As for the point of the article, sleeping the 4 AM to noon shift seems to be stable for me because I never seem to ""crash"" on that schedule as I sometimes do on others.  I can stay up much longer than 4 AM, even completely miss a sleep period, and still be back to 4 AM to noon the next day; I cannot do that with other sleep schedules.",1252801953

She was one of the all time greats--the only person besides Linus Pauling to win not one, but TWO Nobel Prizes. Despite extremely meager resources, and at great personal cost, she discovered, isolated, and named two new radioactive elements, polonium and radium. She also discovered thorium, but didn't get official credit for it. She discovered radiation therapy for cancer. Her work laid the foundation for the the work of Max Planck and Niels Bohr and the nuclear age, both its helpful and harmful aspects. Without her work, there would have been no atom bomb, and no nuclear energy. Her influence is vastly important and far-reaching.<p>Parents don't want their children to swear because it's vulgar and coarse.

28425,comment,28410,28410,0,0,aston,,,"Let's not pretend there's nothing good about OOP. Obviously it doesn't solve any more problems than any other programming model (they're all Turing Complete), so personal preference will have to come into play.<p>Besides, most of pg's gripes about OO are mostly gripes about bad programming. I've seen some seriously elegant stuff done in even the uncoolest of languages. Google runs entirely on OO languages (C++, Java, Python), and you'd be hard pressed to find someone willing to criticize their codebase for bloat, duplication, or inefficiency.",1181935402

Neither does technical news (a la Digg and Reddit). <p>Assuming you pick something hugely popular and you're the best (Godin suggests you'd also be the only) aggregator on the web, you're going to have some serious traffic. The presidential campaign videos has one such huge audience. Another might be following a professional sports league or tracking music videos within a genre.",1181934428

How much of the Python standard library is no longer the ""Pythonic"" way of doing standard things?  Why aren't APIs with more refined design, like Requests, pushed back into the standard library, and made the real one way to do it?<p>Well, OK, you'd have the problem of redundant libraries starting to stack up--it's already looking tiresome.  For instance, Requests would have to be urllib3, since there is already a urllib2 and urllib.  This article wants me to install simplejson, but there's already a Python json module: oh I see, it was merged in from simplejson, and now they are developed in parallel, so using simplejson may still be better, wtf?  Why is there an htmllib in the standard library if I'm always going to use lxml instead?  Let's not even discuss eyesores like the heritage of the subprocess and threading libraries...",1318996748

So apps have to catch up when they move to v4.0. There was a big push to get apps to build UIs which work on phone and tablets, which not many developers adopted because of immense number of bugs in their Compat Libraries. v4.0 is just going to make it worse -- my users are still running 2.2/2.3, so I can't abandon them. And I refuse to maintain multiple code branches.<p>If you know the details and spend a few minutes thinking about what's involved in making stuff 'just work', you'll realize how painful it is.

It's almost come to a point where they ignore serviceability of products and just keep churning out new ones, expecting the eco system to keep up. And given Google's 'excellent' QA, my code is full of runtime-conditional checking to enable/disable features based on the user's version. Since users are slow to upgrade (carriers slow to push updates), the test matrix just keeps growing and keeps getting more complex.<p>Each SDK introduces new permissions, so now your app doesn't auto-update anymore. Which means you have a bunch of different versions of your app floating around, without converging. (I can write a whole essay about how their permissions stuff is broken - see iOS' model for a non-broken alternative).<p>There is a reason Honeycomb adoption is abysmal - developers haven't gotten around to customizing their apps for it, which in turn results in lower sales of Honeycomb devices.

3128454,comment,3127697,3128413,5,0,shioyama,,,"Have you looked at Japanese websites? Most of them have pretty terrible design/UI. It's the same thing.<p>My take on this is that you have to look more broadly to understand the tendency for cluttered design in Japanese interfaces. Walk around a small neighbourhood in Tokyo and you'll see how cluttered the layout is. On small ""roji"" (back alleyways), Japanese like to stack potted plants outside their front doors in a pretty disorganized arrangement. Streets are generally not straight, neighbourhoods rarely follow a grid layout.<p>(Shimokitazawa is probably the best example in Tokyo of this: <a href=""http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/11/04/japan-debating-the-fate-of-shimokitazawa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/11/04/japan-debating-the-...</a> )<p>It's the same thing with cluttered interface design, except that whereas in urban layout it produces something amazingly complex, intricate and fascinating to explore, in UI design it just results in frustration and inefficiency. But I'm convinced the two come from the same source, and that you can't entirely separate them.<p>The beautifully designed interiors you mention come from a completely different place (mentally, not physically). I don't quite know how to reconcile the fact that the two come from the same country/culture, but I do believe they have both been here for a long long time. It's just that software somehow tends to bring out the former, whereas monozukuri brings out the latter.",1318994180

Why is there a cultural aversion to creating beautiful software? As an example, Honda has some of the most beautifully designed interiors in the automotive world. Simple, elegant, functional, with quality materials. The design is often very Apple-like (at least relative to other manufacturers, though they are improving). I would think that the culture that gave us wonderful interaction with a vehicle would be able to provide a similar sort of experience with a phone. What's bizarre is that most pre-iPhone Japanese phones have the UX of a mid-90s Buick: lots of buttons, nothing really arranged properly.<p>To me it's just strange that they were unable to produce it, but I am not surprised at all that the iPhone is so popular.

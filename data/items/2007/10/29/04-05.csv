73645,comment,72952,72988,0,0,qaexl,,,"I have the same experience too. <p>However, when I run though what Joel was talking about, you create a feature list with the estimate first. Keeping track of the time you spent on a feature means going down the list and putting down how much time you spent on it. Keeping track of time by just entering in a log has always been problematic for me. <p>And not having to keep track of interruptions is even better.",1193633411

73643,comment,73346,73576,0,0,gscott,,,"Reasonable enough, it is my gut feeling that those numbers are achievable but it is a little difficult to prove now.<p>There is money to be made in helping other people make more money, with Realty Agents I want to help them make more money with marketing tools and tying it all together in the 'virtual office' being OfficeZilla.  I want to attack the network marketer angle with an integrated system tying the OfficeZilla features with a replicated website system, and autoresponder system.<p>I went to work creating a replicated website system back in 1999 that is running today it has 2400 customers and clears about 15 a month from each client.  I was promised a founding position in that company, I am still a little unhappy about the things that happened between then and now.  I plan to attack that segment in a different way, I am pretty sure I can hit easily that many paying network marketing clients.<p>I just lust after integrating the features of Asterisk PBX into OfficeZilla and further tying that into the website system that is managed inside of OfficeZilla so if you are a realty agent you can have a voicemail message about the house, click to call functionality on the website, and other neat pbx stuff that all works seamlessly inside of OfficeZilla. <p>I don't have any sources of capital to turn to at this time so I have to give a little away, move over this hump between having a lot of happy users to being able to have a lot of happy paying users.  People will pay you when you promise to make them more money.  That is what I am promising, this system will be adapted to make the customer more money.  I could go on, but long posts don't work well in this forum.  I am confident I am tenacious enough to pull this off!<p>",1193632483

I first encountered it when trawling Stanford courses for good problem sets and research projects. Sebastian Thrun used to teach a class with this book (<a href=""http://robots.stanford.edu/cs223b04/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robots.stanford.edu/cs223b04/</a>). It is fairly expensive and fairly  mathematical but it is worth every cent you pay for it (imho).<p>Good Luck ! ",1193631673

Also, I haven&#x27;t had time to implement federation. If this is something that interests you, you can help implement it if you want. The locator is less than 300 lines of code, so it should be easy to understand. My long term plan is to use a protocol like telehash instead of my own hand rolled one. However, you can have as many locators in your client as you want. So this way, you can have redundancy.",1429991754

At companies I&#x27;ve worked at, if you&#x27;re checked out, you do not last.
At companies I&#x27;ve worked at, some prodigies have very high positions at 30; some maintenance steady goers may find a good pace in the middle into senior age.
A successful corporation lets every employee both contribute, and stretch.
And working with experienced people who know what they are doing is the best way to learn real skills that can&#x27;t be learned from reading an open source project wiki.",1429991683

It is a different kind of application than typical e-commerce because it revolves around a scheduling component so that farmers can drop off food at the food hub and customers can pick it up their or have it delivered.<p>There are many others working on similar systems such as <a href=""http://openfoodfoundation.org/project/open-food-network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openfoodfoundation.org/project/open-food-network</a><p>There are hundreds of these &#x27;food hubs&#x27; in the United States ( definition: <a href=""http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/foodhubs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/foodhubs</a> ).<p>As far as I observed, each food hub seems to operate quite differently thus making it difficult to facilitate each food hub&#x27;s needs in one application.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a &quot;market leader&quot; software.  This is a very grass roots sector and I suspect many food hubs are operating using excel spreadsheets or homebrew solutions.<p>Anyways, there is a lot of opportunity to make a big difference in the world around you.

Yes, I know, you should use a real HTML parser like BeautifulSoup if you can. But sometimes you don&#x27;t have one available, or you&#x27;re working with legacy tools.<p>More importantly, if you&#x27;re looking through the code and you don&#x27;t know what tags are self-closing, you can&#x27;t instantly tell whether something&#x27;s a syntax error or not. Off hand, do you know which of the SVG tags are self-closing, vs. those that permit optional but rarely-used contents? [0] What about the embed tag? If you make a mistake in rattling off that list, then you cannot claim that you can read through an arbitrary @mdo-compliant document and know with certainty whether there is or is not a syntax error. And I&#x27;d bet that many talented frontend developers would make a mistake.<p>It&#x27;s an extra character that makes your HTML parse-able by a person or program that isn&#x27;t a geek (or the programmatic equivalent thereof) who&#x27;s read the HTML spec. And that&#x27;s well worth the pinky-press.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#foreign-elements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#foreign-elements</a>",1429991522

A three month contract became nine. By then I&#x27;d managed to pay off my student debt and put aside a decent amount. I quit and traveled.<p>Three months in southern Africa and three months in the United Kingdom.<p>It was my second trip to southern Africa and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Different the second time around. While I was exploring different areas, I had a much better sense of what to expect from each situation.<p>My first trip to the UK. I wasted a lot of time in those three months, which could have been better spent. I did see quite a lot, but generally I treated it mostly as a tools down and relaxation period. I did return to Australia, but 12 months later, I was back in the UK and lived there for a further 13 years.<p>Returning to Australia, it was straightforward enough to find work. I think I was offered something on my third interview. This just happened to be with a company which would go on to become a dotcom giant, survive the crash and continues to do reasonably well today. Everything worked out well enough.<p>I would certainly do it all again. If I had the choice to do things differently, I probably would have cut short the UK period and seen more of Europe, although I did a lot of that in subsequent years.<p>In short, I would encourage people to do something like this. I don&#x27;t think breaks of even up to 12 months in a career should be a concern, especially if explained easily enough. The experiences are worth a great deal.",1429991415

The Rorschach is able to tell you at least that.

There are a lot of motivations to go with chip on board tech, mostly the chips can be cheaper as you have removed an entire chunk of steps and fallout out of the production process. Interestingly for me, the <i>reason</i> this is becoming more popular is that because feature sizes are so small, the silicon cost of these parts is dominated by the pin pads, not the logic. So making the pads big enough to put solder balls on them for COB assembly doesn&#x27;t materially increase the cost of the die, and yet saves packaging, bondout, and post packaging testing.",1429991265

These forms cover different proportions of the ground area.<p>If developed with buildings of the same height and depth the pavilion form would provide the lowest density and the patio form the highest.

Figure 2.2 illustrates this principle [see: <a href=""http://imgur.com/LmJ1tTg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/LmJ1tTg</a> ].

There are:<p>1. &quot;run-time dependencies&quot; — package B needs package A installed because a binary from B actually makes use of a file from  A when it runs.<p>2. &quot;install-time dependencies&quot; — package B needs package A installed because B is effectively a &quot;plugin&quot; for A. B is theoretically useless <i>to the OS</i>, except when used in the context of a sane A-like environment. This usually also implies that B, when installing itself, will run a script provided by A, usually to register itself in a database that A owns. This doesn&#x27;t at all imply, though, that you couldn&#x27;t just directly call the binary contained in the A package for a useful effect.<p>3. &quot;asynchronous/maintenance-time dependencies&quot; — package B needs package A because B does something to increase the system&#x27;s entropy, and is written to assume that the system will compensate for this by having A running.<p>Docker images really only need type-1 dependencies, but as you dig toward the core of a package dependency graph, you start to see a lot more of type-2 and type-3 dependencies. If you execute a &quot;debootstrap --variant=minbase&quot;, pretty much everything in there is there for type-2 or type-3 reasons.<p>A Docker container doesn&#x27;t need to be a maintainable or autonomous OS distribution. It doesn&#x27;t need grub, it doesn&#x27;t need mkfs or fsck, it doesn&#x27;t need mkinitramfs or the HAL hwdb; it doesn&#x27;t need localegen, or debconf, or even apt itself. It needs to be a baked, static collection of files related to the application&#x27;s run-time needs. But there&#x27;s no demand you can make of apt or yum or even debootstrap that will spit out such a thing.<p>There was a project somewhat in this vein a long time ago, for embedded systems, called &quot;Emdebian Baked&quot;[1]. It was a misstep, I think, because it focused on creating variants of packages and a secondary dependency graph; rather than being a transformation one could apply to existing packages and the existing graph.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on and off on creating a transformation tool—effectively, a combination of a dependency graph &quot;patch&quot; that contains empty virtual-packages for many essential-package dependencies, a file filter/blacklist, and a final package whose installation burns away the whole package-management infrastructure from the chroot this is executing in. I haven&#x27;t been happy with any of the results yet, though.

I was basically chasing the default setup of a distro, which has no real point.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say, don&#x27;t care at all. Maybe just avoid overthinking. :)<p>Main differences of distros to keep in mind:<p>1) The default setup. (Desktop environment, already installed software, etc.)
2) Available packages. What software and versions of software are available to you without much hassle.
3) System upgradeability. (Rolling - always up to date, or a 6 month release schedule or something in between)<p>If I were to suggest something, It would be a variant of Arch called Antergos. You get an Arch linux that:<p>1) Is as easy to install as Ubuntu/Mint etc.
2) Good default setup selection. (Multiple desktop environments and more arguably the benefit of little bloatware)
3) It IS arch, just a extra enabled repository. (Antergoses own). This means you get the AUR (Arch user repository) that gives you easy access to packages that other distros might not have, although they are less reliable. (Though I have yet to see any problems in 2 years) AND the latest versions of much software. (Again can be bad, but in my experience I&#x27;ve only encountered minor annoyances that get fixed quite fast). BUT WAIT, there is more! It&#x27;s rolling release. Always up to date. :)<p>In my experience the stability concerns of arch are a myth. If they do occur, it&#x27;s not like you see crashing of your computer or massive graphical anomalies. Sleep might not trigger properly for a day or two or something like that. And rarely.

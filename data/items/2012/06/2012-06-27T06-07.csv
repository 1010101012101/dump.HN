4165897,comment,4164675,4165620,2,0,einhverfr,,,"Actually, I am not at all convinced by Chomsky's idea of universal grammar.  I think here the structuralists and post-structuralists have an important edge (post-structuralism is built on structuralism and the basic thesis is that meaning arises from the system of rules, not the individual rules).  IMO Chomsky tries to move away from the basic Structuralist thesis (by Sapir and others) and move towards something else.<p>So for example when you look across language families you find that most of the constraints follow in an almost mathematical way from other choices.  For example, once you have a language which is fairly isolated (as opposed to synthetic or polysynthetic) and doesn't use a lot of inflections, then word order becomes the only reasonable way to express relationships between words.  If on the other hand, you have a synthetic language with lots of inflections, you might not need to worry about word order at all (Old English poetry for example).<p>The options available for polysynthetic languages are different still.<p>But these aren't the only constraints.  Consider for example the way Austronesian languages often essentially ""unbound"" words by redoubling them, so in Indonesian duduk means to sit, but duduk-duduk means to sit about casually, or informally, or repeatedly (unbounding can occur with regard to time, social structures, etc).  Similarly kuru means ""horse"" and kuru-kuru can either mean ""horses"" (but only if no numbers are specified) or horse-like (i.e. a sawhorse).  Similarly ayam means chicken, and ayam-ayam can either mean chickens or it can mean a kind of fish that people decided is somehow chicken-like (""sea-ckicken?"")... On the other hand we would never say dua kuru-kuru to mean ""two horses"" since that would probably mean ""two sawhorses"" instead.  Instead it is ""dua kuru"" (translating word-for-word without converting structures, this means ""two horse,"" note the singular).<p>Where structuralism breaks down (and where post-structuralism is important) is an area which was noted even by Sapir, one of the founders of structuralism, and this is the dynamic quality of grammar over time.  Sapir's example from 1912 was the slow, gradual death of ""whom"" as an objective/dative form of ""who.""  He points out that nobody really would say in every day speech ""whom did you see today?"" but instead ""who did you see today?"" and that no cadre of English teachers could reverse that trend.  The idea that grammar is not static but changing over time, and hence is fluid is something which really lead to the development of post-structuralism as a general thesis in language study.<p>I don't think you can get from brain structures directly to grammar for the same reason you can't just treat chemistry as applied quantum physics.  The added complexity, esp. combined with neuroplasticity, provides infinite possibilities regarding language structures, provided that we have some way of referencing things (breaking this down strictly into words, phrases, and sentences doesn't work for reasons Sapir points out in his surveys of Native American languages-- all languages may somehow break things down into words and sentences, but there is no natural mapping of objects to words or multiple words to phrases or sentences).<p>Back to non-standard dialects.... I wonder for example, how the African American Vernacular English (AAVE) phrases in Jason Mraz's song ""I'm Yours"" get misunderstood.  Granted he shifts back and forth between AAVE and Contemporary Standard American English (CSAE) seemingly fluidly.  But phrases like ""before the cool done run out"" have relatively specific meanings and carry a lot more meaning in AAVE while they sound just wrong in CSAE.",1340780344

There is a misconception about market makers and the nature of a spread. In particularly illiquid markets, market makers allow you to buy and sell immediately. This is a service. The spread pays for this service. The more liquid a market is the lower the spread (eg it is essentially if not actually zero on US Treasuries);<p>2. For those questioning our brightest and best being ""wasted"" on HFT, I see comparatively better value on all the bright minds being wasted on social networks;<p>3. Finance is a constant arms race. The flavour of the month is HFT. In 5-10 years it'll be something else where low-latency transactions are just taken for granted. This kind of market is a gold mine for innovators as the existing players need a certain amount of innovation just to stand still (relative to the other players). There is classic ""mine the miners"" opportunity here;<p>4. There is a lot of highly-leveraged trading that goes on, automated and otherwise, beyond the world of HFT. (I believe) Warren Buffett describes this as ""picking up nickels in front of a bulldozer"" [1]. In extreme market situations, market models go out the window and the highly leveraged are the first to go to the flames. Just ask Bear Stearns [2] with its 35:1 leveraged ratio.<p>5. Financial institutions have access to way more data and cheaper (typically free) transactions compared to the average investor. It's common practice to do things like whipsaw the market to hit stop loss orders and the like. Honestly, unless you're a bank in the short term it is an insider's game;<p>6. A lot of the problems with the lack of transparency, assymmetry of information between parties and bad behaviour (like flooding exchanges) comes down to a failure of regulation. The SEC is either toothless or has been subverted by political interests. Much of what happens in the US just doesn't happen in Australia (to the same degree at least). Just take all the fake documentation in the US housing bubble. How bank executives, loan originators and the like didn't go to jail for this is really astounding;<p>7. Banks and market funds have limited to no downside risk. If things go horribly pear-shaped the US Federal government will--<i>and has</i>--bail them out. This breeds an adverse appetite for risk. I subscribe to the view that the Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the IMF are in large part welfare for investment bankers; and<p>8. Banks and funds are too large. If something is ""too big to fail"" then it's too big and needs to be broken up.<p>That is all.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns</a>",1340778683

Let's say 15 women are on a dating website and 30 men.  Taken in and of itself, this sounds great for women.<p>But the distribution of objectives matter.  Let's say 13 of the women are looking long-term committed relationships and 2 are looking for something casual.  This is a gross oversimplification but bear with me.  If 25 men are looking for something more casual and 5 are in it for something more long-term, all of the sudden you have a system with 45 people where only 7 of them ""have it easy"" if you go by numbers - 2 of whom are women.<p>Now these aren't real figures but anecdotally I would say I'm in the right ballpark.

Generative communication says nothing about how the semantics are implemented; they may use an intermediary, or they may not. The early version of C-Linda did not use intermediaries, and was intended for in-process communication. Of course, a practical, distributed implementation of generative communication uses intermediaries. But then again, depending on the implementation, it may be distributed across multiple intermediaries.<p>I would say a message queue would necessarily have monotonicity (the name surely implies it!), which generative communication does not have.<p>> The sender and receiver don't have to be up at the same time.<p>In academic parlance this is called time decoupling, and it is an awesome property.

In general, the big movers and shakers in financial markets act in quite economically rational ways.  There is a natural selection process at work where the people who are good at using their brain to accumulate money, accumulate money, and thus have more impact in the market.  If you look at many cases where wealthy market players appear to be acting irrationally, what you'll often see is they are acting in a personally rational manner, but are operating in a context with very perverse incentives.  So I am curious if anyone in the HN commentariat knows the specific perverse incentives involved that prevent this more optimal system from happening. ( Joe Retail investor can be quite irrational.  But I'm wondering why the Stock Exchanges and big corporations accept the status quo with regards to HFT.)",1340776819

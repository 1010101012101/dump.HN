The way to change them is from the inside: get a core group of members on-side, put candidates up for election and start building support among the membership.<p>Reading around, there's at least some movement on the open-access front in the IEEE.  IEEE allows authors to pay a hefty up-front free to make their paper ""open-access"" [1] and one of the candidates in the last election has the words ""open-access"" in his statement [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://theinstitute.ieee.org/briefings/business/ieee-expands-openaccess-offerings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theinstitute.ieee.org/briefings/business/ieee-expands...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/election/2012candidates.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/election/2012candidates....</a><p>Edit: grammar",1360411168

That's why you want to talk to a lawyer.<p>It's because it's what's called an unenforceable contract [1], because if they close the account for any reason, that reason could be because you are selling some goods, but PayPal doesn't like it.

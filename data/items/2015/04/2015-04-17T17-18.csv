I just started reading your &quot;Lean Startup&quot; book and as I understand the main thing is to validate the idea and build out MVP before building out features that people might not even need.<p>I am a software engineer and have an idea of building a marketplace to connect brands to instagram users that have a large amount of followers.

In particular, I would be significantly more swayed by the argument that WikiLeaks is press (even responsible press) if the did indeed selectively publish only documents of clear and material public interest. I haven&#x27;t looked at these documents myself (and won&#x27;t) but it sounds like that&#x27;s a small number indeed.<p>Incidentally, press doesn&#x27;t default to being for the net good just because it&#x27;s press (which is a broad classification, and an amoral one). It still has to act on behalf of good, and on a case by case basis.<p>As far as corporate rights go, it&#x27;s not black and white, but we shouldn&#x27;t lose sight that corporations are made of up people, and those people should have rights, and it&#x27;s probably better not to just throw those rights away <i>just</i> because something was done in the context of work (since work is such a huge and generally unavoidable part of all of our lives).<p>Thanks again for thoughtfully debating.

Images are segmented in blocks, and each small block can be well approximated by a low frequency content, but block boundaries can contain discontinuities. If you look at the wolfram alpha source, that&#x27;s exactly how those images are constructed -- they are combinations low frequency segments, most likely obtained through fourier analysis.<p>Another trick used in frequency domain compression is they don&#x27;t impose a hard cut-off of frequencies (truncation); instead they specify weights according to image quality, and lower are assigned to high frequencies, and those weights control the precision of each frequency.<p>All this works because real signals happen to be concentrated in certain frequencies, with a few discontinuities in between.",1429293400

They combined the courses so they could spend more time on the introductory math courses.<p>Before, there was a grade 13 that provided a better math foundation for university, but since that was eliminated, they needed to spend more time on the math as students were doing consistently poor. Things have improved in the math courses since the change, though.<p>The other reason why they combined the courses was that we were the only engineering department that had separate courses for them.

The child beating scenario is a hypothetical. A 1:1 mapping with today&#x27;s situation is that this child would be in Shanghai. I could fly over and try to save that child. Or, I could rely on those people that are surrounding the child already to have a more vested interest than I do as someone on the other side of the globe.<p>Am I to fly around the world, saving everyone? Is that even possible? What about the children not immediately near me, but closer than Shanghai? Haiti or Mexico for example.
I think the people in the Shanghai region have more responsibility to save that child than me. When we did try to save that child in Iraq, we ignored the child in Haiti, Mexico and here at home too. And so many unintended consequences (like the region assuming: oh, the US is here, we&#x27;ll do nothing now).
People are good across the globe, it&#x27;s naive to think we&#x27;re the only one interested in saving children. Unfortunately it&#x27;s usually a political ruse than a genuine interest to help. Instead, the children here, Haiti and Mexico either have no oil, or are already under US political control- so the industrialists in bed with the gov&#x27;t don&#x27;t care about children beaten there. That&#x27;s the real answer.<p>Also, does anyone honestly believe the people of Shanghai -want- our help saving their beaten children? Just about as much as we want the Chinese coming to San Francisco to save our children in need.<p>Hypotheticals are good for making points easier to get across. But I wouldn&#x27;t accept an overly simplified hypothetical like yours without qualifications. The way you framed yours lines up with how the war profiteers want the argument to be framed. I mean, Shanghai is a big enough city that you know for a fact that there is literally a child being beaten there, right now. There&#x27;s many good reasons you&#x27;re not buying a ticket personally to go find that child and save him or her.<p>You could say, &quot;the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot; Well then, best order your ticket now. Think about those reasons why you aren&#x27;t doing that. Those are the same reasons we shouldn&#x27;t be sending guys with -guns- over there either to &quot;help&quot;.

I&#x27;ve fallen sideways from a stationary position several times over the last 5 years as an avid cyclist when I&#x27;ve had lapses in judgment or focus when declipping from my pedals.<p>I&#x27;ve never used pedal clips.  I do ride in traffic, but I doubt I average more than 15 miles per hour.<p>> Further, I was struck by a car from behind 2 years ago and lost consciousness, propelled forward several meters, broke several ribs, suffered large abrasions on my back. My helmet suffered dents and scratches, but my head and face were 100% fine. If not for the helmet, I would have 100% suffered from cuts and abrasions to my face<p>That last sentence doesn&#x27;t really make sense.  Bicycle helmets do not cover one&#x27;s face.  Also, getting hit from behind by a vehicle is the least common type of crash from what I&#x27;ve read.<p>> The fact that bicycle helmets don&#x27;t protect you from every type of accident situation is a ridiculous reason to not wear one.<p>If they were designed in a way that would protect me in most crashes, then I certainly would wear one while riding, but given the standard I referenced, I seriously doubt it.<p>If FMVSS 209 stated that seat belts in cars were only tested in frontal collisions at speeds of 20 mph or less, then I wouldn&#x27;t bother wearing them because I know that they wouldn&#x27;t protect me while I&#x27;m driving at highway speeds.  Fortunately, that&#x27;s not the case and I always wear my seat belt while riding in or driving a car.<p>In the end, the way one rides is far more effective in mitigating the risk of getting involved in a crash (like following the rules of the road, having appropriate equipment, etc.)",1429293004

9395936,comment,9392776,9395223,0,0,grovulent,,,"Yeah - I&#x27;m making that comparison.  Because firstly - Bitcoin is being treated as a commodity by governments around the world (particularly when it comes to taxation policy).<p>Secondly, we&#x27;re talking about broad perceptions of trust in institutions and ecosystems - such that even when Bitcoin is compared to non-insured forms of investment (as opposed to FDIC insured forms of deposits), the bitcoin ecosystem still gets a relatively bad rap.  The collapse of the commodities brokerage firm MF Global was to the tune of billions of dollars of client and creditor funds.  Not insured.  Tough luck.  Yet no systemic black mark gets recorded.<p>Thirdly - even if we ARE going to compare the bitcoin ecosystem to currencies as opposed to commodities - we might want to acknowledge that Mt Gox was an exchange - not a bank.  There are plenty of Forex brokers which do not have insured deposits for their clients (unless they are also banks themselves).  And forex companies dropped like flies during the financial crisis, taking client funds with them.  So why is Bitcoin perceived as inferior to normal currency on account of a loss of client funds at Mt Gox?  For some reason everyone thinks it&#x27;s logical to compare MT Gox with FDIC insured banks.  Clearly a HIGHER standard is being expected for bitcoin here than for normal currency given the type of comparisons being made.<p>Fourth - some Bitcoin institutions DO have insurance on deposits.  Coinbase, Circle and the like have limited private insurance. Elliptic offers insurance backed by a major private insurer.  And while I accept that this insurance doesn&#x27;t compare to FDIC insurance - note that there hasn&#x27;t yet been a loss of depositor funds at any of these major VC backed start ups.<p>Yes - ultimately lack of FDIC insurance is a strong reason not to use Bitcoin.  I&#x27;m not denying overall that there are good reasons to avoid bitcoin.  My point is that the level of distrust and suspicion directed toward bitcoin is not commensurate given appropriate comparisons made with other sectors.",1429292747

That&#x27;s the reason why people didn&#x27;t do it before 1901, not because nobody had invented the concept of a fixed wing aircraft (they had, with gliders) but because engines were simply too heavy for their power output to carry both themselves and a passenger.<p>PS - Yes, Whitehead/Wright deserve credit, they often had to tweak engines, optimise the design, optimise the propeller, and so on.

  be acceptable. This is not so. On the contrary, we   
  believe that the p < .05 bar is too easy to pass and sometimes
  serves as an excuse for lower quality research. We hope
  and anticipate that banning the NHSTP will have the
  effect of increasing the quality of submitted manuscripts
  by liberating authors from the stultified structure of
  NHSTP thinking thereby eliminating an important
  obstacle to creative thinking. The NHSTP has dominated
  psychology for decades; we hope that by instituting
  the first NHSTP ban, we demonstrate that
  psychology does not need the crutch of the NHSTP,
  and that other journals follow suit.

Since they are on a fixed schedule, they always have the same amount of data, hence a fixed block size.<p>Since data is arriving at the OS in fixed blocks, the lowest latency way to handle the data is deal with the blocks when the arrive.

9395798,comment,9395352,9395352,0,0,kumarski,,,"The problem is that the production methodologies for Pu-238 are ridiculous and have a ridiculous number of volatile critical dependencies in both the creation and harvesting process.<p>&quot;This has been the method of choice at the Department of Energy&#x27;s Savannah River Site (SRS) production reactors. However, there are several shortcomings with this method of production. First, the production efficiency is quite limited, i.e., to approximately 13% efficiency. This is seen from the fact that the Pu-238 produced in the target after only 2.12 day&#x27;s half-life decay, itself becomes a target for production of higher isotopes of plutonium, thus reducing the Pu-238 purity by producing Pu-239 and Pu-240. Second, this process produce a hazardous Pu-236 by-product. As noted on the decay chain, above, there is a η→2η or γ→η reaction that results in the production of Uranium-236 (U-236) and Pu-236. These reactions increase with exposure to fast neutron flux. Pu-236 decays to U-232, which has a hazardous gamma-ray energy emitting daughter product. Even a few parts per million U-232 increase the radiation exposure hazard to personnel dramatically. Lastly, Np-237 must be chemically purified before target fabrication. This is seen from the fact that Np-237 decays to Protactinium-233 (Pa-233), which in turn has a strong gamma-ray emission with its beta decay to U-233 (half-life 27 days). Therefore, the Np-237 was stored in solution at SRS and chemically processed immediately before fabricating targets. Solution storage of Np-237 may not be practical at an alternate production site.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US6896716"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US6896716</a><p>The extent to which this should worry our interstellar concerns is huge.

A member of the Archive Team graciously offered to host gitorious.org as a read-only archive on Gitorious.org and GitLab agreed to allow to use the Gitorious.org domain name for this.<p>This is a huge benefit to anyone depending on gitorious.org as repositories will remain available at the same location. Cloning and fetching will continue to work as well. Projects you may depend on will stay around even if it isn’t moved to GitLab.<p>In order to build the archive we need to make Gitorious.org read-only prior to the shutdown date.

It&#x27;s worth noting that pg considers[0] &quot;inappropriate&quot; to be one of the central nodes of a graph of lazy labels.

You can&#x27;t be oppressed by an idea, viewpoint, or comment.  That&#x27;s not oppression, that&#x27;s disagreement in a free society.<p>The article makes the point that the solution to hate is not hate in the opposite direction.  Yet that&#x27;s exactly what it seems like you advocate when you say that the Internet has drastically increased the ability of people with minority viewpoints to be heard, and then turn around and say you&#x27;re glad that people who hold &quot;old opinions&quot; are not comfortable enough to share their viewpoints in public.  Which is it, a more open or more closed marketplace of ideas?<p><pre><code>    >  they should [work through their opinions] privately
</code></pre>
The privatization of belief and the search for truth does nothing to help a secular, pluralistic society come together and live in harmony.  Rather the opposite, when the only truth we agree on societally is the hivemind in search of the &quot;arc of history&quot;, we&#x27;ll end up with no basis on which to reject the totalitarian, authoritarian ideas which inevitably come in to fill the void.<p>At the risk of offending Godwin, I&#x27;d just like to point out that Hitler did not take over Germany with &quot;old opinions&quot; held by the establishment[2], but by some of the most highly educated moral philosophers of his day.  Smart, progressive, socially-minded people who are asking good questions can still come to drastically wrong answers.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nazi_ideologues"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nazi_ideologues</a>",1429290472

Having more of these makes you more of a constructive contributor to society.  You&#x27;re a man among men.<p>Very few jobs or social roles can serve even a few of these components of character.  Historically, going to war has been an established and respected way to demonstrate you are indeed made of sterner stuff.<p>Of course, if <i>your</i> war has a dubious justification or muddied purpose, that will complicate its ability somewhat to define you favorably.  Aside from WWII and perhaps WWI, American wars since 1865 largely have been Faustian bargains.

I&#x27;ve been using Rethink for a few years now on side projects (as well as maintaining a driver, even if I skip a few server versions here and there...but these guys move fast).<p>The composable queries alone are enough to make any developer happy. You can pretty much treat your data as if it&#x27;s in-memory because the drivers integrate so well with the language. The relational model works really well.<p>Things I have not tried yet are clustering and the real-time support (still need to build this into the lisp driver) but I&#x27;m trying to slot some time to do this. One of the projects I&#x27;m working on (<a href=""https://turtl.it"" rel=""nofollow"">https://turtl.it</a>) is going through a nice upgrade to mobile right now, and this will include some server changes...I&#x27;m looking forward to implementing changefeeds to solidify the collaboration aspect.<p>Overall I&#x27;ve been really impressed with Rethink over the years, and can&#x27;t express how excited I am they hit production ready. On top of the DB being great, the team is really nice to work with. They are incredibly responsive on github and were really helpful when I was first starting to build out my driver.<p>Great post, and congrats to the Rethink team!",1429290126

If you want to upgrade to the latest OS packages, you can ""cap rubber:bootstrap"" or use ""cap invoke"" to execute whatever command you want on the remote machines.  If you're referring to the rubber modules, you just re-run the generator when we issue an update, much like with other generated source projects.

But none have been more painful, irrational or bloody our perpetually-losing battle with PayPal.  I have written the following to help other startup founders using PayPal fail faster.<p>How to get PayPal to Freeze your account in four easy steps.<p>1.  Be a bootstrapping startup.  \nWith no funding, transactions or big names behind us, we set up our PayPal merchant account like any innocent first-time founders would: by following procedure.  We provided our Employer Identification Number, a summary of our business, a summary of how we would be using PayPal for our transactions, and all the other good details you’d a payment service to require.  All good?  It seemed so, but then we got greedy.  We wanted to use PayPal Pro to streamline our transactions.<p>2. Apply for Payments Pro.  \nWe first get a phone call from a representative at PayPal informing us that Vayable is conducting illegal activity by running a business without a Travel Seller’s license from the State of California.  Without this license number, they tell us, we cannot use PayPal’s service.  This is the first we’ve heard of needing to acquire a Travel Seller’s license, as we’re not actually selling travel, but I go ahead and look into it.  Turns out, the State will not issue us a Travel Seller’s license even if we wanted one: they’re reserved for sellers of transportation, like airlines and bus companies.  We do not do this.  We are a community marketplace for individuals to buy and sell unique experiences from one another.  Think Etsy or Airbnb for EventBrite for unique travel experiences-- Or whatever marketplace startup du jour you want to throw before “unique experiences.” (Note: Etsy, Airbnb  and Eventbrite all use PayPal).<p>I call PayPal back and tell them that we in no way fall under the state’s definition of a Seller of Travel and therefore not only don’t need the license, but wouldn’t qualify for it.  “Then we’re going to have to decline your application for Payments Pro” I am told by three different representatives. (I’m always a believer in calling back to talk to someone else if the first person doesn’t give you the answer you want).  In this case, no one was giving us the answer we wanted.  Time to pivot.<p>3.  Comply with PayPal’s requests.  \nAfter failing to qualify to use Payments Pro, we decide to go with another one of their merchant products:  Express Checkout, a free and streamlined merchant service PayPal released last fall that does not require a lengthy application process.   While building it into our site,  we receive a notification from PayPal that our merchant account is going under review (note: we have yet to test a single transaction yet).  They are concerned that we are are not a real business, they say, and ask us to submit our Articles of Incorporation as well as our EIN number (which I had already submitted several times) in the enrollment process) as well as a statement of how we intend to use PayPal for our transactions.  Of course, we comply. Within an hour of receiving the email from them, I have uploaded these documents to the Resolution Center, as requested, and wait.  And wait. And wait.  After several days of hearing nothing back, I call PayPal.  I talk to a guy in their customer support department who informs me that the account is fine, but they just need to verify that the business name is actually Vayable.  This sounds odd to me.  So again, I provide them with the material and am assured by customer support that the account will be restored to good standing as soon as they look over the paperwork I’ve provided.  Ten days later, our account status has not changed and I still cannot get any more information from PayPal customer support.<p>4. Stay Loyal.\nWith no new information, we decide to charge ahead and implement PayPal into the site. After all, we need transaction on the site and PayPal is the most widely recommended and seemingly accommodating platform.  After a painful implementation process (which involved the server-side technical problems from PayPal throughout, making it nearly impossible to test and use the sandbox), we finally got our Express Checkout up and running.  Seamless and perfect? Far from it.  Functional and secure?  Yes.  Less than 12 hours after getting the service us and running, I receive the following email from PayPal:<p>Dear Jamie Wong,<p>Thank you for your response.<p>Per our Acceptable Use Policy, under credit card association rules, PayPal\ncannot permit the use of the PayPal service as a funding method for payment\nprocessors to collect payments on behalf of merchants.   Upon review of\nyour account, it appears that you are offering an aggregation service that\nallows multiple merchants to process transactions that are against various\nAcceptable Use rules.  The service you provide allows said merchants to\ncircumvent our policies.<p>While we wish you the best of success in your future business endeavors, we\nrespectfully ask that you seek another method of payment for your online\nbusiness.<p>Your PayPal Account has been limited and there will be no appeals to the\ndecision.  Any remaining funds in your account balance will be held for 180\ndays from the date of the limitation.  Once 180 days has passed, the funds\nwill be available for withdrawal.<p>If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us again.<p>Sincerely,\nJulie\nPayPal Compliance Department\nPayPal, an eBay Company<p>Responses to this email address are not monitored.  Please send any\nadditional questions that you may have to compliance@paypal.com.<p>Translation: Your account has been frozen and there’s nothing you can do about it.  \nUpon referring to PayPal’s Acceptable Use Policy, as they suggest, I find nothing to suggest we are not in compliance.   In fact, we seem to be the exact kind of merchant PayPal would want using its services.  We are bringing them new users by requiring our customers to pay with PayPal, we are building a global marketplace that is ideal case study for PayPal’s robust risk management and fraud management and we’re a budding new startup that enables a brand new community of merchants and transactions, off of which PayPal will be able to profit.<p>We’re still unclear why PayPal froze our account, but we’ve got a pretty good idea of how it happened, which really started with following procedure, followed by compliance, followed by loyalty to their service.<p>PayPal doesn’t want their cut of tens of millions of dollars of revenue we project in the next two years.   Any idea of who does?<p>-Jamie Wong \nCo-Founder, Vayable.com\nhttp://blog.vayable.com",1299728515

If you have a large pool of applicants you want to take steps that reduce the size of the pool while increasing the average quality inside the pool. Remember, you're not trying to pick the single very best individual in that pool; you're just trying to pick someone who's well qualified. Why? Because processing a large pool of applicants and completely ranking the entire pool is prohibitively expensive and doesn't give the employer much marginal benefit.<p>Now, let's consider what happens in an economy with high structural unemployment. First, the pool of applicants for every job opening becomes much larger, pushing more and more businesses to employ quick, cost-effective filters to the applicant pool. Second, the new people who join this pool are the newly unemployed, who are less likely to be well qualified. Even worse, the people who can't find work stay unemployed, become more desperate, and apply for more jobs, including jobs they're not well qualified for.<p>As a result, there's a lower proportion of well qualified applicants among the unemployed applicants. Sure, there are well qualified applicants in there, just a lower proportion. Lower, even, than there would be if it wasn't for the high structural unemployment. But among the employed applicants, there are just as many well qualified applicants as ever. Also, the pool of already-employed applicants is much smaller than the complete pool of applicants.<p>What happens when you ignore applications from unemployed people? You go from a huge pool with a low proportion of well qualified applicants to a much smaller pool with a higher proportion of well qualified applicants. How is that not a win?<p>And I wouldn't discount this thinking out of hand, either. People generally do things for reasons and act upon the evidence that's available to them. I'm willing to bet that most of these companies that don't even consider unemployed applicants chose that policy because someone went through hundreds of hopeless applications from unemployed and completely unqualified people and decided it wasn't worth the effort.<p>Also, keep in mind that all I've done here is show how it could be rational and self-interested to ignore job applications from unemployed applicants.

If anything they're probably hurting performance by bombarding the local nameserver with a flood of requests.<p>It's a tragedy of the commons.  Each individual user gains personal performance from DNS prefetching.  The gain for each individual user is greater than their loss to their share of the performance penalty imposed on the entire system.<p>The real super smart answer would be predictive prefetching based on pointer movement.  When the browser sees the mouse heading towards a link, start prefetching.  Or at least on mouseover.",1299726304

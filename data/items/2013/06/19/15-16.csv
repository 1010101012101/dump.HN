And how do we relate the (primarily:) monetary cost of making it free-to-ride with the (primarily:) non-monetary benefits of any given shift? The result of this question could give you an answer if making it free would be worthwhile.<p>Some thoughts:<p>I think decreasing the price per ride from e.g. 1 USD to 0 USD would make for a bigger shift in uptake than decreasing it from 2 USD to 1 USD. Not having to think about whether each single tour is worth the price of admission makes it a viable default way of getting around. This is just the usual flat rate argument that also applies to things like internet usage.<p>Making public transport free would invariably result not just in a shift towards it from other modes of transportation, it would also lead to an overall increase in mobility, which in terms of some resources reduced the gains in efficiency.<p>There&#x27;s a valid argument that the efficiency of public transport is highly dependant on the amount of utilization: big buses and trains carrying single digit amounts of passengers can use up more energy than individual transportation. An increase in overall uptake would tend to reduce such problems since you&#x27;d get a small bus load full of people in cases where you&#x27;d have only a few now.<p>Obviously, free to ride public transportation is a particularly huge potential improvement for people who otherwise could not afford to get around. And since mobility is such an important part of life in modern society (minus us nerds who manage to leave the house only once per week), free-to-ride public transport has a massive impact in terms of social equalization.",1371657129

You can get some idea of why here <a href=""http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/</a> or here  <a href=""http://www.webpagetest.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webpagetest.org/</a><p>b) Your design changes drastically between those pages, breaking the user&#x27;s flow and attention. 37signals products do a nice job of maintaining conformity between pricing grid to checkout as an example.<p>c) You&#x27;re treating a SAAS checkout like a product checkout - asking about quantity, list price, etc. What % of your users add multiple services to the cart? Can you keep this in more of a flow?<p>d) You have no visible security certificate on the page at all, when in fact even the placement of your security certificate on checkout can make a drastic impact in conversion eg <a href=""http://www.conversionvoodoo.com/blog/2010/07/proper-placement-of-trust-logos-can-make-a-huge-difference-in-conversion-rate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.conversionvoodoo.com/blog/2010/07/proper-placemen...</a><p>e) Yes, some people are still confused by what a CVV2 / CVC2 code is and displaying a visual explanation can help your conversions.<p>So my challenge for you is focus on the RIGHT area on your page to test - your highest intent traffic and I think you will find that a lot fewer cycles need be wasted and A/B testing remains one of the highest ROI activities your org can embark on.",1371657067

Changing your branding, including fairly major redesigns, reliably fails to make a difference.<p>But lots of other kinds of changes reliably do make a difference.  Big button.  Putting signup link in multiple places.  The word &quot;Free&quot;.  Streamlining your form.  (No, you don&#x27;t want to ask for first/last name.)  Email headlines.  Providing relevant results first.<p>However they make small differences.  You need to plan on tens of thousands of successful conversions in your test.  You can make this easier by running multiple tests at once.  If you&#x27;re a small company, you can make conversion be &quot;to the next step in the conversion funnel&quot; instead of &quot;to the end&quot;.  (But be warned, companies that test long enough and get large enough tend to find examples of cases where that short cut burned them.)<p>However it is very important to set expectations.  Expect to find few big wins.  Expect most to be modest wins.  Keep track.  For an established company, if A/B testing is adding 5-20% to your bottom line each year, it is totally worthwhile.  (If you have traffic and have not been testing, then odds are that your first year will find more than a 20% boost.  But this declines in future years.)<p>A/B testing is a valuable tool.

How is the government the majority?<p>In the U.S. the law making branch of the government is comprised of representatives elected by the people.  These representatives necessarily draft laws to suit the majority who elected them.  Ergo, the legislative branch wields power at the behest of the majority, analogous to the wolves in the quote.  Governance by mob rule, i.e. pure democracy, entails no inherent constraints on what the government (comprised of law makers elected by the majority) could do to or take from the rest of the populace.  We are, instead, a constitutional republic, which constrains the majority-elected government to a narrow set of powers enumerated in the constitution.<p>The quote was written in 1992 in reference to two lawsuits in the state of California, itself a constitutional republic.  One resulted in the quashing of a state law which was supported by the majority but nonetheless violated the state and federal constitutions.  The other resulted in the removal of a cross from a popular public landmark.  Much outcry was made at the time that the will of the majority was being thwarted.<p>I&#x27;ll leave here the entirety of Simkin&#x27;s posting that contained the quote:<p><i>The ACLU&#x27;s cross lawsuit and the Libertarians&#x27; tax lawsuit share an interesting theme. We have been treated to the spectacle of politicians pleading for permission to continue breaking the law. In the case of the jail tax, it is particularly ironic that the lawbreakers say they need the illegal money so they can lock up the lawbreakers. Ask not for whom the lock clicks.</i><p><i>Democracy is not freedom. Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to eat for lunch. Freedom comes from the recognition of certain rights which may not be taken, not even by a 99% vote. Those rights are spelled out in the Bill of Rights and in our California Constitution. Voters and politicians alike would do well to take a look at the rights we each hold, which must never be chipped away by the whim of the majority.</i>",1371656381

When we special-case terrorism we&#x27;re no longer on solid ground - whether it&#x27;s in favor of <i>looser</i> or <i>stricter</i> treatment.<p>So, here&#x27;s the thing: the <i>level</i> of false positives, when calculated <i>in aggregate</i> can suggest unreasonable enforcement. If 95% of all searches yield nothing, there is a legitimate question of whether or not your targeting is reasonable. This is the primary legal argument being used, for example, in the ACLU&#x27;s case against NYC&#x27;s stop and frisk policy.<p>But a <i>single case</i> of a false positive, with no further information, cannot be taken as evidence either way.

You pay a maximum of 10% of your earnings above 150% of the household poverty level (but no more than you would under an ordinary 10 year repayment plan), capitalized interest capped (over the lifetime of the loan) at 10% of the original principal, balance forgiven after 20 years.<p>It&#x27;s progressive, there&#x27;s a safety net, and it is, for the time being, solvent (government makes 30-50% profit on each dollar lent). Yes, people with great credit who would end up paying less under a standard 10 year repayment at say 5% end up subsidizing those who graduate without getting a decent job, but I think that&#x27;s uniquely justifiable in this context, because everyone involved is turning to the student loans as a way to better their economic situation (after all, nothing stops you from paying in cash or getting a private loan at 5% if you can qualify for one).<p>I think if you added a cap in there instead of going up to full cost of attendance, to force schools to moderate their tuitions, it would be nearly perfect.",1371655917

At the end of the day, good people are willing to take a pay cut to work at an organization they perceive to be socially beneficial, but only so much of one. Their kids still have to go to college, after all. And if the organization can raise the money, why object to its paying what it needs to attract good people? After all, NYU is in a location where you just can&#x27;t buy a reasonable apartment on a professor&#x27;s salary. That&#x27;s why it goes to such lengths to offer housing options to professors (it&#x27;s the largest land owner in lower Manhattan, IIRC).<p>Now, the problem in this particular case, however, is that there is a massive market distortion in play: federal student loans. Because federal student loans are guaranteed up to the cost of attendance with almost no credit check, schools can raise prices to whatever they want with almost zero impact on demand. If students could only get loans based on parental credit, tuitions at places like NYU would collapse.",1371654802

And that, given the growth and promise of the space, would be silly.<p>Consider the 700% licensing fee increases.

That content was going to be stripped regardless of what production Netflix was engaged in.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t matter if Netflix can magically realize 10x revenue per subscriber overnight, because there is game theory at play here.  Big content is happy to make nice marginal payouts from Netflix on the side, but they will do anything to prevent Netflix from consolidating a comprehensive library of A-list content because they already have by far the broadest device reach, and if they get all the content, cable cutting will ramp up overnight and destroy any leverage for rights holders because there will be nowhere else they can go for distribution.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s not good if Netflix goes all-in on original programming and fails, potentially taking the rest of the company down as well.</i><p>They have no choice.  Big content will never let them win.  With their own content at least they have a chance to control their own destiny.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s not good if Hollywood feels little pressure to make it easier for consumers to access their content because they&#x27;re getting great contracts with traditional distributors.</i><p>As long as customers balk at paying $10/month for Netflix while happily shelling out $150/month for cable, Netflix has no leverage.<p>On balance I have to agree with the OA&#x27;s assertion.  Netflix putting some of its money directly to production can only benefit viewers overall.  Putting that money to more contracts is not going to move the needle in terms of production from the major studios, to them it&#x27;s just gravy at this point.",1371654710

With the cable companies you often had no competitor to switch to until the satellite options gained popularity, but they quickly turned into the same as the cable providers because there wasn&#x27;t much competition on that front. Just like laying cable, it costs money to launch satellites.<p>On the other hand, a direct competitor to Netflix is much easier to pull off as there&#x27;s no cable to lay nor satellites to launch. What I would worry over is if a company like Netflix starts pushing for exclusivity in certain markets using local laws much like how the cable companies obtained their stranglehold on their markets.

Most articles on this topic that I have read either include sample sizes so embarrassingly tiny it raises questions if the author even understood his statistics class (30 to 300) to simply not including numbers at all.<p>#2 If your audience is already pre-sold on your product when they visit your site, landing page changes won&#x27;t be as meaningful. Possibly relevant to Jitbit, in this case.<p>#3 When you do conversion optimization, eventually you hit a number that simply becomes unbeatable. Stating the obvious, you can&#x27;t convert at over 100%. Depending on traffic source/quality/intention you may find that ceiling to be lower, around 60-70%.",1371654181

Still, assuming there would be disagreement about that, I wanted to be generous with the number to show that even if we&#x27;re extremely liberal with total daily traffic, we still are dealing with extremely small sustained load per second and small burst traffic.<p>As I said earlier, because we&#x27;ve all seen sites knocked offline by this kind of media attention, there is a widespread belief that the traffic in question is huge.  It is not.  Rather, the traffic some sites see as a result of being featured in this way is simply the first time they&#x27;ve been tested with any sort of concurrent usage.

I figured you could manually fight with the xorg.conf (which I did last time I had a non-intel card years ago), but by that stage, I&#x27;d already spent heaps of time fighting with the card, and it was a work machine and I wanted to get work done. I just wanted to dual-screen Cinnamon, and the free driver did that with software rendering... with my quad-core pegged to 70%. But I live in the console, so I don&#x27;t notice it except when I open htop - it was deemed &#x27;good enough&#x27;.<p>In any case, the AMD drivers, at the current time, require stupid shennanigans to go beyond basics and the nvidia ones don&#x27;t. The domain knowledge you need is quite high, and the target shifts so rapidly that the search engines are filled with out-of-date cruft.<p>Thanks for the info, by the way - I do appreciate it, but there is already a replacement card coming...",1371654005

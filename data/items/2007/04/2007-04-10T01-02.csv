11065,comment,11062,11062,0,0,rms,,,"Drug tests are my favorite example of corporations creating practical law. At this point in America, personal consumption of illicit drugs is effectively legal because of the unenforceability of drug laws thanks to our right to privacy. If you work for a major corporation drugs become illegal because insurance companies mandate pre-employment drug testing. The actuaries can easily show this lowers how often they have to pay for rehab.<p>For the article itself, the author doesn't make much of a point about the inaccuracy of drug tests because he made up the 99% percent accuracy figure. Drug tests are more accurate than that because all positive results are retested with a more expensive, more accurate test.",1176169856

11059,comment,11049,11049,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Go read Pauls essays. He covers aspects like this from his own experiences and those of groups he's funded.<p>Generally the theme is ""Its better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all"". Many employers (at good companies at least) will see someone who attempted to start a company as a person with good leadership skills and a strong work ethic. If anything this could help you get a job. Thats of course assuming you didnt do something stupid like drop out of school first.<p>Also, you can learn much through a failure. Look at the Justin.tv guys. They knew what it took to be successful the second time around by learning from their mistakes with kiko. Now they are totally rocking it.

11058,comment,10908,10908,0,0,thingsilearned,,,"Great article!  I'm starting this summer and if we don't get the Ycombinator gig we've got a tough decision to make about where to start.  I'm currently of the opinion that we should live in my parents basement for the 3 months and not come out until we've got a beta to launch.  This way I can also take the last class I need to complete my masters and no money will be spent.  My partner is more of the opinion that we should move directly to SV.  Anyone with any experience or advice on this as we debate it out?  Also, I'll have to search this outsidethevalley.com more thoroughly but what does one do to get these one on one meetings with VCs?

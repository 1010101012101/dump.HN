234064,comment,233530,233705,0,0,jcl,,,"I don't understand what they mean by ""no VB runtime"".  My impression was that the VB installer always included all the DLLs necessary to run on a generic Win32 system.  If they change something to break VB programs, they'll also be breaking lots of other Win32 software, too.",1215007153

Then I discovered vim, it seemed as powerful and I used it until 2002 when I disovered Jedit.<p>It was around 2005, that I started using Eclipse. I think I was the last kid in the block to use it and it is a big help, I love the refactoring functionality.",1215006938

The long tail exists because links and traffic on the web (roughly approximating attention/buying intent/market size) follow a power law.<p>So of course there are still going to be hits that seem to be ""winner take all""; if it weren't for the ""fat head"", we wouldn't need to talk about the long tail.<p>The long tail becomes important in the age of the web because it's more accessible. Just because it's accessible doesn't mean it is going to make you rich -- but it's more possible than it was before the web.<p>You really don't have to look very hard to find business that could not exist without the web.  So the long tail as a ""theory"" is almost self-evident.<p>So, I just don't understand what there is to refute or debunk.",1215006050

234049,comment,233530,234002,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I realise that, although I'd have to say it's not exactly the way I would have handled the situation. In my experience, linking binary Fortran libraries against C code doesn't lead to interfaces that expect such array pointers, and when porting Fortran code to C, I would have probably handled the index numbering issue with a macro for element access where converting to 0-based notation isn't completely foolproof.<p>Actually, I probably would have provided the numerical recipes code in two versions, one in the 1-based format, the other in idiomatic C.<p>But then I'm more of a software engineer than a computational physicist even though my degree certificate claims otherwise.",1215005796

I'm never angry at a site if I click on a link and a new tab pops up.

234033,comment,233971,233971,0,0,aurora72,,,"I've started recently with LISP and it's been a rewarding experience. I've noticed that it's just more flexible than the C-like languages. For example, I have been able to get the factorial of a number as big as 3000 in a very short time! That was simply not possible with a C-like program. I've used Emacs with the ""Superior Lisp Interaction Mode"" preloaded, upon the suggestion I got from useful book ""Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel"" (It's available on line at gigamonkeys.com)<p>I have also acquired the book ""ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham"", which is a classic and no-nonsense book. I personally find Paul Graham's approach quite refreshing.<p>Having seen Ruby being employed in various environments, I've also started to learn Ruby.  It's a multi-paradigm and dynamic language and hope to use it in a RoR application development. It kind of forces you to think dynamically and that helps you to write more efficient code, I guess.<p>So far, I couldn't find enough time for either Java or Python.<p>And oh, lastly I must say: C++ with templates (STL) is quite indispensable. If you master C++ with all its features like STL, you'll find that it can handle a whole lot of things quite elegantly.",1215004163

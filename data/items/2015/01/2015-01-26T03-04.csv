up the forms for a user interface, but
a CICS application usually makes
heavy use of database, say, relational database,
e.g., DB/2 although there may still be some
IMS usage still hanging on.<p>One use of CICS was for heads down medical
claims processing, across all four US
time zones.  The site our team from
IBM Research visited wanted high reliability:
If the site was down for, say, an hour,
then the data entry staff would have to
be called back on a Saturday, for at least
half a day, at a higher rate per hour.
One such outage in a year, and the CIO
could lose his bonus.  Two and he could
lose his job.  The site was very <i>uptight</i>.
Getting into the <i>glass house</i> was
not easy; might have been easier to get
into the White House Oval Office.<p>At one time to make CICS more secure,
there was some interest in having
processor hardware support for
<i>address sub-spaces</i>.  Another
idea was <i>cross memory</i> where a
program could call and execute, say,
a function in another address space.
There were also <i>data spaces</i>, that
is, address spaces with just data and
no code but that could be accessed
by other address spaces with code.<p>Net, the IBM mainframes are not really
simple things.  Cloning one would not
be easy, and at IBM&#x27;s next version of

Their earnings also suffered: through age thirty, men who started school later earned less.&quot;<p>From the abstract of the paper it references [1]:<p>&quot;We find evidence for a small positive effect of starting school younger on IQ scores measured at age 18. In contrast, we find evidence of much larger positive effects of age at test, and these results are very robust. [...] There appears to be a short-run positive effect on earnings of beginning school at a younger age; however, this effect has essentially disappeared by age 30.&quot;<p>Not quite as sensationalist as the summary in the article!  Students starting school younger had slightly higher test scores at age 18.  However, the age when taking the test had a greater effect, so students starting older would still presumably have an advantage in tests taken at graduation (given that they would still be older).  Students starting younger earned more, but only slightly and only until age 30.<p>I expect the real conclusion to be drawn is that it&#x27;s silly to obsess over what age to start your kid in school.  Start them when they seem ready, and spend more time focusing on supporting them at home (in their education and otherwise) than worrying about the findings of these studies.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w13969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w13969</a>",1422244506

to give &quot;luster&quot; to the company.<p>It&#x27;s easy to suspect that the main

negative attitudes on (1) Research

in revenue and (2) transferring projects
from Research to the rest of the company
for development or sales.  Our project
in Research was quite exceptional and transferred
two projects, both of which went
to customers and got sold, but our
group was unusual, and our success was not
wanted by the higher ups.<p>At one time Gerstner mentioned 
&quot;all the exciting projects coming out of

of IBM as an electronics company or
a computer company, but you would be wrong.
IBM is a marketing company, and it would
get into the grocery business tomorrow
if it saw a business opportunity there.
You might think that Research comes up
with new product designs, development
turns them into products, and marketing
sells them, but that is exactly backwards.
Instead, marketing figures out what 
they can sell, development builds it,
and they go to Research if necessary.&quot;<p>So, maybe the current changes amount to
IBM trying some new things to <i>market</i>.",1422243099

Watson effectively translates the question into something equivalent to an SQL query, then executes it, and answers the top result.<p>What a human mind does is very, very different. It could perhaps be described like this : &quot;put the electrical impulses on the outgoing nerves that seem like past successful Jeopardy players would have put on theirs in this situation&quot;. Your mind doesn&#x27;t &quot;answer&quot; any question for starters. It simply reacts to the situation, the difference is in that your mind doesn&#x27;t know or care about the difference between a question and a rocket falling out of the sky. Same prediction happens.<p>This reaction contains far more data than Watson will ever output. It contains the actual answer, encoded in had movements necessary to write them down. It contains instructions to pick up the pen, hold the board, crouch over the board so your hand would be in reach of the board, hide the answer from your competitors, ... You could easily write a 1000-page book about the response of your mind to simple situations (I&#x27;ve read a near-2000 page book that talks exclusively about the 3d math needed to control two fingers). This answer was produced by your cortex, which contains more computing elements than the internet. More data was transferred in your mind to weak computing elements than gets transferred on the internet in an entire US state for the same time frame. Granted, those computing elements are somewhat (a LOT) slower than a CPU, but there&#x27;s 100 neurons in your cortex for every CPU ever sold, which is estimated to be a billion. (and I&#x27;m cheating with those numbers, for example the total data transfer that occurs in a single CPU easily outstrips internet traffic for a medium city. So your mind looks at the same amount of data as about a dozen cpus in the same time, much less impressive)<p>Fundamentally it&#x27;s the &quot;best&quot; reaction your mind knows how to have. Best being defined something along the lines of &quot;if you did this in front of me, you&#x27;d get maximum attention from my mind&quot; (in this case hopefully because you&#x27;d win Jeopardy.

TimesFree keeps track of how much time each member has given and received, so everyone pulls their weight.<p>There&#x27;s no need for anyone to take on all the boring administration and co-ordination duties of a co-op or timebank with TimesFree - so you&#x27;ll have even more time to share!<p>TimesFree lets you:<p><pre><code>   •  Create an account with Facebook, Twitter or your email address

   •  Find exchanges - groups of people sharing time and tasks - near you

   •  Start your own exchange in moments, share it socially and invite your friends 

   •  Control who can join your exchange, and whether it&#x27;s displayed in search results. You can keep your group totally private if you like!

   •  To get help from people in an exchange, create a request with the date, time and how long you need someone for. It takes seconds, and you&#x27;ll see if your request matches anyone&#x27;s schedule before you post!

   •  Choose to get notifications when someone posts a task that matches your schedule

   •  Get notifications when someone accepts your requests, and when they start or finish working on them

   •  Chat with other members within the app so you can ask any questions about a request before you accept it, and co-ordinate with the people who want to share with you to get things done.

   •  Instant access to help and customer service from anywhere in the app - just swipe down with two fingers to read all about how to use the page you&#x27;re on, or send a chat message to the app team. We&#x27;ll get back to you as soon as we can!</code></pre>",1422241911

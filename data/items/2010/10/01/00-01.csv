Originally they were even in a different order--his only concession to angry end-users was to arrange them like OSX, in a different order than originally envisioned.  Or take the indicator applet: his complaint was that the regular system tray icons are cluttered and disorganized. Solution: reinvent the system tray (which had fairly clear HIG defined by Gnome, which for the most part were followed), almost bit for bit, but with different colored icons, no tooltips, and no default left-click action.  If you look at the old system tray and the new indicator applet, they quite literally are almost identical in appearance/clutterdness (yes, he merged mail and IM, and with Maverick merged volume and the music player, so that's two less icons, but the usefulness of those changes is up for debate).<p>I call it a dictatorship because big decisions like that are made by him, seemingly by fiat.  He even calls himself SABDFL (self-appointed benevolent dictator for life).<p>Shuttleworth is trying to be the Jobs of the OSS world--making design decisions because he thinks he knows software design best.  Which is fine--like you said, he's paying for it all.  But the difference between him and Jobs is that Jobs <i>defines</i> useable software where Shuttleworth just copies and reinvents.  And in my opinion, Shuttleworth doesn't seem to have the insight into users' thought processes that Jobs has.<p>Again, you're right, the man is paying for it all, so who am I to complain?  I can just pick a different distro.  But the problem is that with all of these more serious stability problems remaining unsolved and stuff like windicators and indicator applets and fonts getting all the attention, I and others might eventually get fed up and switch to a more stable distro (does one exist?  Will I go back to Windows?), or not recommend Ubuntu to friends.<p>What should I tell my friend: Yeah, install Ubuntu, it's great, but whatever you do, don't let it automatically update because your laptop might never suspend correctly after that?",1285893279

This was also before Apple gave up on firewire and went USB only.  Further people have enough confusion hooking things up, so giving them a failproof solution is pretty ideal.  People really do have trouble confusing video and audio RCA jacks, for instance.  This single port has allowed Apple to transition thru dozens of product and models over almost a decade without having any compatibility confusion or hassle, and no special $20 adapters, etc.  Compare this to the situation we've seen in the last decade with video ports-- and they only do one thing, yet there have been a half dozen different ""Standards"".<p>What is most interesting here is the default presumption that Apple is doing this for proprietary ""monopolistic"" reasons.<p>*though the first ipod had an actual firewire port, a later model which was intended for windows as well had the dock connector which supported both firewire and USB and Apple shipped different cables for mac and windows iPod users.",1285891470

She is pretty young, and I am not sure she has had a real job + startup experience to say what she is saying.  While I agree that to do build a successful startup, that has to be your number one focus,  and having a job will be really distracting.  But, you can do some prototyping/idea vetting, while you are working full time, and quit only when you think you have something substantial, and already have a solid plan.<p>If you are in a dilema, go ahead ad do it.  The real question if, if you are in your 20s or 30s, and don't have a mortgage/kids or a green card application going on, why are you working on a big corp?<p>1. Save money, have at least one year to two years of savings.<p>2. Leave your job in good terms. Tell your manager and co-workers ""I taking a break from corporate world this year, doing some traveling, and some little project. I hope I will see you guys again in the future, and would love to work again.""<p>3. Start your startup.<p>4. In one year, here are your options:<p><pre><code>   a) Startup went well, \n\n   b) Startup failed, you wasted 30-40k (no biggie):\n      a.1) Tell your company / ex managers you would want to work there again. If you left with a good terms, you should be able to come in.\n      a.2) Find a job somewhere else, and show your product (A lot of companies like people that can show a finished product, even though it wasn't commercially successful.\n\n</code></pre>\nIn one year, you will learn a lot more, and be a lot more marketable to other companies, (if you have something decent to show). The only risk your are taking is 30-40k (depending on how low your living expenses are), + whatever your are missing as a salary. Keep in mind, that if you can sawllow a lot of risk, you should totally do it.  Once you get married with kids, it will be really really hard to do it (almost impossible).<p>My point is: if you are 1) really good at building products from scratch.  2) You can take risks/have a low risk profile 3) Have at least 40-60k saved.  \nWhy in the heck are you NOT trying to start something, or join something. Big corp job will always be there  (if you are good, off course).<p>----<p>Ps1. Do quit a job, and build another stupid niche thing (you see many 'startups' that are just building a feature, and not a bussines).  You can use the time at your company to test the market, verify your product-idea (or even build a prototype), before quitting.<p>PS2. If you don't have at least 50-70k savings after 5 years of working as an engineer, you really should look at your spending habits.  Start saving now.",1285891454

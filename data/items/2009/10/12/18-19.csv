A SAN, otoh, is such a block device and traditional filesystems operate on them.<p>This means that you can run a RDBMS on a SAN, while you can't on GFS/HDFS.

I've started with it sending characters at 25 wpm, with spaces in between to get the effective sending rate down to 15 wpm.

I just wish there was a Linux clone of it, as it's not quite perfect and could be improved (for example, from time to time there's a tiny glitch in the audio that could make me miss a character.

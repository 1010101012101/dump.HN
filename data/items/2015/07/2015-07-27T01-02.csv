I prefer config files because it&#x27;s easier for me to communicate to other team members what needs to be present in their local development environment.<p>I typically handle this by versioning a `config.example` file, which includes all the necessary config keys an application expects. The example file defaults these attrs to various strings meant to show they are examples only. I include instructions to copy the `config.example` to a `config.yml` (or some other appropriate extension), and replace the values as necessary. The `config.yml` file is specifically excluded in the `.gitignore` file. The application will only load the `config.yml` file when started, so I also ensure to raise a descriptive error informing team members when they are missing a local `config.yml`.<p>This allows the `config.example` to also serve as a self-documenting config for the application, as comments can be included that identify and explain each of the config keys and their purposes.",1437962180

9952973,comment,9948255,9952408,0,0,mikeash,,,"Lack of a hair fiber is both evidence that the suspect was never there and evidence that the suspect was there and cleaned up his hair afterwards. How much weight it lends to each depends on context (i.e. if you have a lot of other evidence that he was there, then then cleaning theory is much more likely) but it does support both.<p>Look at it like this: beforehand, there were three possibilities: the suspect was never there, the suspect was there and left behind hair, or the suspect was there and cleaned up. (You might add more, like the suspect being bald, but the general approach is the same.) If you then do a thorough search for the suspect&#x27;s hair and find none, that removes the &quot;left behind hair&quot; possibility, leaving you with the other two. The probability of each is increased compared to before. How much each one increases depends on the context.<p>As for civil cases, I don&#x27;t really see the problem. All you need to show for a civil case is that your version of events is more than 50% likely to be true. Even if body cameras fail on their own with great frequency, the odds of one failing naturally <i>right</i> at the critical moment when an officer supposedly abused a civilian are extremely low.<p>I also don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t make good estimates of body camera reliability right now. They&#x27;re not magic. They&#x27;re just electronics, not fundamentally different from a GoPro or similar. How often do those fail? The rates should be much the same.<p>There should also be weight given to the nature of the failure, of course. If a capacitor exploded, it was probably &quot;natural causes.&quot; If it was mysteriously smashed, with a tread pattern that matches the tires on the officer&#x27;s squad car, that ought to be enough to win a civil suit. Other circumstances will vary, but I&#x27;d say the number of cases where you have a &quot;mysterious failure&quot; that really is a legitimate electronics failure will be low.",1437961895

In some cases, the auto maker will agree to repurchase recalled vehicles, the people added.<p>Fiat Chrysler is expected to sign a consent order agreeing to the penalties, which could be unveiled as soon as Monday, the people said. Fiat Chrysler will have an opportunity to recoup some of the financial penalty if it meets certain conditions, the people said.<p>The government penalties target lapses spanning nearly two dozen recalls affecting more than 11 million Fiat Chrysler vehicles, including older Jeeps with rear gasoline tanks linked to numerous fatal fires.<p>The fines are tied to legal violations in an array of areas, including misleading and obstructing regulators; inadequate and lagging repairs; and failing to alert car owners to recalls in a timely manner, the people said. The financial penalties aren’t tied to specific recalls, they said.<p>With 1.56 million recalled Jeeps linked to deadly fires, the agency has accused Fiat Chrysler of lagging in installing trailer hitches on the backs of vehicles for added protection in lower-speed collisions. Fiat Chrysler has said vehicle owners are often unwilling to get repairs despite many outreaches from the company.<p>Under terms of the settlement with regulators, Fiat Chrysler is expected to start offering cash to Jeep owners to encourage them to go to dealerships for repairs or additional money on top of the value of their vehicle if they decide to trade it in, the people said. The Jeep Grand Cherokee and Liberty sport-utility vehicles covered under the recall have model years ranging from 1993 to 2007.<p>Fiat Chrysler’s executive in charge of vehicle safety and regulatory compliance earlier this month outlined measures the company has taken to improve its handling of safety problems and said the auto maker could have handled recalls better and that NHTSA officials raised legitimate concerns.<p>The government penalties come days after regulators separately started probing Fiat Chrysler’s handling of recalled vehicles with possible cybersecurity flaws, after hackers commandeered controls of a moving Jeep. Those vehicles aren’t included in the settlement expected to be disclosed in the coming week.<p>The fines against Fiat Chrysler top the $70 million the government assessed against Honda Motor Co. earlier this year for lapses in reporting possible safety problems and a $35 million fine paid by General Motors Co. in 2014 for failing to alert regulators in a timely manner to a faulty ignition switch now linked to more than 120 deaths.<p>Car makers and auto-safety regulators have faced persistent criticism on Capitol Hill and from elsewhere for problems handling safety defects. GM and Takata Corp. of Japan face Justice Department probes for deadly flaws with ignition switches and rupturing air bags, respectively. Auto-safety regulators, meanwhile, have adopted a more aggressive posture after facing criticism for failing to spot safety problems.<p>Regulators at a hearing earlier this month outlined widespread transgressions at Fiat Chrysler, accusing the auto maker of misleading and obstructing the government on its handling of recalls. The lapses included failing to properly alert car owners to recalls, botched repairs and taking too long to fix vehicles. according to regulators.<p>Other scrutinized recalls include Fiat Chrysler vehicles with Takata air bags and others with ignition switches that can slip out of the run position. Regulators are also probing Fiat Chrysler vehicles that continued catching fire after inadequate repairs to headliner wiring; inadvertent air-bag deployments that continued after attempted fixes; and delays addressing vehicles with defective left tie rod assemblies.",1437960186

If you join and your option&#x27;s strike price is $1 and when that company goes publiic its worth several billion, your stock <i>value</i> will reflect the growth during your stay in the company.<p>In (2) there are things you can do, and things you can&#x27;t which will be controlled by the company bylaws. That said, if the company has a lot of &quot;sweetheart&quot; deals just for the executives then you already know its a screwed up place and you might want to seek out a different place to accumulate value. Some companies are run by people who are ill suited to be in that position, recognize that and leave, it isn&#x27;t like there is a scarcity of positions around. Further, if you&#x27;ve been in this situation you can (and probably should) ask when you&#x27;re interviewing if there are any provisions for employees to see their stock as part of a fund raising round.<p>Here too, one needs to understand stock and value. Typically a privately held company will have two classes of stock, one called &quot;preferred&quot; and one called &quot;common&quot;. Preferred stock is usually sold to investors, and sometimes given to the founders. Common stock is usually given to employees.<p>Preferred stock carries special &quot;powers&quot; in the privately held company, it may have preferential liquidation rights, it may get to vote on board decisions, it may have resale rights. Common stock typically has no special rights.<p>But none of that is important when the company goes public, because all shares turn into common shares (although there may be different voting classes like there are for Google shares). It is also true if the acquisition price exceeeds the liquidation preference for the preferred stock. Some money, and/or stock from the acquiring company will filter down to people with common shares.<p>I completely agree with you on (3). The preference overhangs are bad for employees, and I think they are bad for founders too. So if you are a company that can&#x27;t go public and you don&#x27;t have enough revenue to continue operations, that may be your only choice. Or you can just admit you&#x27;re dead and exit. But back to my original point the founders are going to have to believe that with this next round of funding they can get to a viable selfsustaining business. You don&#x27;t have to buy into that as an employee, you can say, &quot;I&#x27;m just not seeing it.&quot; and move on. The founders don&#x27;t get that choice.",1437959984

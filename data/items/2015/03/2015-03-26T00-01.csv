[0]<p>At least once an month in both group chats and one-on-one chats I will get messages that seem out of context. Somewhere between many minutes and an hour later, the messages between the OOC one and the previous [1] message will silently appear. The &quot;new&quot; messages are inserted <i>between</i> the previous and OOC message, and bear timestamps that make it look as if they were never missing.<p>I&#x27;ve even had this happen while I had the conversation in question open in the damn client! It&#x27;s super-fun to see ten or so &quot;new&quot; messages slide in between two already-delivered ones. :/<p>So, if you&#x27;ve ever wondering if you had a brain fart and overlooked an important message in Hangouts, you may very well have not!<p>[0] Yep, I&#x27;m using the latest software.<p>[1] Previous at the time I received the out of context message.",1427331599

9267145,comment,9265084,9266815,0,0,GauntletWizard,,,"I dislike tools that claim to automatically generate your configuration for you. At Google, one of the worst abuses that anyone had to deal with was auto-generated configuration; a tool purported to deal with configuration for you, but really just blutrted a boilerplate mess into your directory, many of the properties and setting set by cargo-cult or overriding sane defaults with baked-in versions of the same. Facebook is proceeding down this path; There&#x27;s a new tool that will do all of your service stuff for you! I look forward to what a boondoggle those services that use it will be.<p>There was a discussion I recently stumbled upon about init systems in containers. Many processes spawned lots of zombies! You need a full init! Well, no; If your process is forking new processes, it should probably wait for them. If it&#x27;s forking other processes that fork other processes, and they&#x27;re not cleaning up zombies when they&#x27;re done, <i>that is a bug in those processes</i>. If all else fails, your root-level process should probably implement a simple init on it&#x27;s own (a wait() on loop in the background, dumping wait objects into a LRU map that other processes can do an equivalent of waitpid() on). Or just run under bash.",1427331541
9267144,comment,9264531,9266982,0,0,hrktb,,,"There was a talk by Matz about ruby 2 and how they were tweaking the runtime to improve garbage collection. I don&#x27;t remember the details but a lot of work went into seeking the best collection behavior to match the language, optimizing for the most common cases, checking the patterns favored by the language and tweaking the behavior to ease these cases, etc.<p>The intersting thing is that there&#x27;s jruby for the JVM, and it makes the different tradeoffs surface better. Looking at this benchmark for instance [0] it&#x27;s easy to see how the tweaked runtime gives a very different performance profile from the generic VM.<p>I have a feeling the highish-level intermediate layer you are talking about would be equivalent to have only some specific tradeoffs despite the optimizations that could be done on a language per language basis.<p>[0]<a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/jruby.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/jruby.php</a>",1427331497
9267142,comment,9266769,9266917,0,0,TaylorAlexander,,,"This is what we get when we embrace closed platforms. Free Software gets you nice, simple, easy to use services and closed platforms will always manipulate you for their needs.<p>This is why I want to make a Free Hardware cell phone. I have made one wireless product already and wrote the frequency hopping stack myself, but something like a phone needs better data rates and a more advanced protocol.<p>Still, I dream of a simple cell phone that runs vanilla linux and has apps for IRC, XMPP, and the other functions you would want. The key component would be that the protocol would be designed from the ground up to respect user privacy, including a &quot;broadcast&quot; mode for towers where certain low data rate data channels are streamed without requiring any transmission from the handset. Then you could follow IRC or twitter during a protest without any risk of being probed for your location.<p>The protocol would also be built with anonymity in mind as much as possible, so phones would route data using rolling anonymous ID numbers and spoofing location could perhaps be trivial for plausible deniability (unless that opens up a vector for DoS).<p>I met the &quot;Game of Drones&quot; guys last night and they seemed interested in my wireless. I can only do 1km at 20kbps with current boards and 10km at 20kbps with amplified boards, but I think they might be interested in a solution that would work for FPV and that could be a good excuse to develop something that would also work for a cell phone.<p>I am 100% Free Hardware all the way, so maybe your dreams can come true eventually. :)",1427331482

But if there is a really critical aspect to what I am doing, say some thread synchronization, I will definitely not just follow some sample code, but read the relevant parts of the memory model of the language specification detailing why this works as expected. If the underlying hardware matters, I will grab the reference manual for it, too.<p>A lot of this is surly curiosity and you can get away without it most of the time, but at least as soon as I run into the first problem it really helps me a lot to have at least a basic understanding of what is going on in the layer of abstraction I am interacting with and maybe a layer or two below.

Reusable data structures are the obvious case for genericity, and I don&#x27;t see many in the docs. Once you have a higher-order language (whether via objects or first-class functions), some control structures become data you might want to use generically. Looking over Java&#x27;s stuff also shows some interfaces one might want to parameterize over a type (e.g., Comparable -- what can you compare this to?, Future -- what type will we get from it?).

9267106,comment,9255145,9266709,0,0,kasabali,,,"> The real usability problem with Emacs&#x27; scrolling, in my opinion, is that the default scroll increment is too large. That&#x27;s easily fixed. Some people also don&#x27;t like that keying the cursor past the top or bottom of the window causing a large jump as the displayed region recenters around the point, but again, that&#x27;s easily fixed.<p>You&#x27;re right on spot with that one but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that easy. I mean, I know there are some variables for it, but I&#x27;ll try to explain with my anecdote. The scrolling issues you mentioned was felt so alien in my first try of Emacs, so it was the first thing I set out to fix in my second try. I found the relevant page in Emacs wiki, and damn, there was like 10 or more solutions, some similar, some not, each with their own issues (according to the wiki page, not that I&#x27;ve tried all). Then I went further with a Google search, and there was even more different solutions. As a result, I gave up on it and I still use the defaults even though I hate it with passion.<p>Setting a sane default for such a user facing thing must be top priority, not less.<p>> Most prompts (e.g., yes-or-no prompts, the password prompt for auth-sources) initiated with the mouse use pop-ups. Between that and the file chooser, what exactly is missing?<p>(I don&#x27;t know what <i>unfamiliar</i> had in mind so I&#x27;ll try to explain my own thoughts on the this.)<p>Things like search/replace/goto doesn&#x27;t use pop-ups. But you&#x27;re right that they don&#x27;t need to, thanks for clarifying that. I was actually thinking about things more like dialogs rather than yes/no prompts. Again the window-centric approach I mentioned elsewhere in this thread. I don&#x27;t have exact things in my mind, but yeah, command palette again. I would much prefer C-x C-b to show a dialog/popup which immediately gets focus, and in which I can either easily select the buffer or discard the dialog easily in case I change my mind. Or the About Emacs screen. I know it&#x27;s not a functional thing but still one would expect it to show a dialog window instead of a buffer.  Or the menu bar menus. I don&#x27;t have a specific pain point with it but the whole thing still feels very odd. There is a lot of commands there, some are checkboxes, some fire up some prompts etc. I&#x27;m not sure but I guess some of them would be hidden under a dialog window in a more traditional gui application.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to get more specific in this issue as it falls into the realms of &quot;<i>x</i> <i>feels</i> better but I don&#x27;t know <i>why</i>&quot;. The only thing I know is the extreme use of windows and buffers and it doesn&#x27;t feel right. I&#x27;m sure it feels just right to Emacs veterans but as a newbie I can tell it doesn&#x27;t to the rest.<p>> The command palette looks a lot like helm-M-x to me.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at it and it seems nice. Thanks.<p>>>Speedbar isn&#x27;t even close.<p>> I didn&#x27;t say it was. Now, I don&#x27;t know about connector lines, but direx looks the same to me as Sublime&#x27;s file tree sidebar and neotree even has icons.<p>I checked both of them and I&#x27;m sure none of them are what <i>unfamiliar</i> had in his mind when talking about &quot;Filesystem trees with pixel-wide connector lines and icons indicating file type, displayed in a smaller font than the main text are better than a file tree drawn with ASCII art.&quot; Both as ASCII art as it gets. Both are still rendered inside a buffer and they use a different font than the other gui elements in the system. The only different thing is neotree can display icons and that&#x27;s all. Both are only marginally better than speedbar and they&#x27;re <i>joke</i> when evaluated according to <i>unfamiliar</i>&#x27;s criterias above.",1427331021

This is as reasonable as critiquing Java because it is hard to understand for people who do not know how to program. You&#x27;re welcome to claim that Haskell has a larger barrier to entry, but that is a fundamentally different claim from the claim that operators make the language harder to read for practitioners.

Functions returning boolean have a method called test, and suppliers have methods called get, or getAsInt, getAsLong, getAsDouble, or getAsBoolean.&quot;</i><p>The solution that go offers for such problems seems to be to deny that there is such a thing as libraries and to promise to deliver migration scripts whenever changes in the language or its libraries break existing programs.<p>That approach works fine now, but I am not sure it scales to a situation where go is truly successful; in particular, I think go, at some time, will have to allow for dynamic linking to support commercial libraries, if it wants to become truly successful.<p>On the other hand, the times of copy protection on software being normal are far behind us, and CLR has an ecosystem for commercial libraries, that decompile so well that CLR libraries do not differ much source code. Maybe, I am underestimating the willingness of commercial vendors to start shipping libraries in source form.",1427330009

Without reading the source code of libraries, without reading relevant standards, without understanding the mathematics behind algorithms, there is always this feeling I may make really dumb mistakes. Really understanding all the bits and pieces obviously does not make your code bug free, but I am usually pretty confident that I did not do something horribly wrong.",1427328201

Syntax that only a programmer would like is necessary, and quite a bit of it at that.  R is a much better fit for people who want to do statistics first, and as little programming as possible.<p>Thinks like function parameters being promises make it far easier to deal with functions like optimizers where there really are 10+ tuning parameters or things you may want to tweak.  Iterative languages are far easier to understand for people who don&#x27;t want to be programmers.<p>You cannot develop plyr or ggplot in a language agnostic way, because they need the purpose built syntax R has.  Contrast to eg the fight in python to get an infix matrix multiplication operator.",1427328181

Even if so, making an area with poor food into one with better food is quite obviously an example of acting based on a desire to get more than you can as a hunter-gatherer, so accepting your own argument here disproves your claim that hunter-gatherers were content with what they got and didn&#x27;t seek to get more.<p>> I&#x27;m merely trying to get you to realize that there are many reasons for technological progress (esp. the adoption of agriculture), the least of all being that &quot;it&#x27;s human nature to want more&quot;.<p>But your own defense of that position has been to present an argument that boils down to the motivation being <i>exactly</i> to get more.",1427328013

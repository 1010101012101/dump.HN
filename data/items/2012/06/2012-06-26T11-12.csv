   standardized parameters, thus introducing the need for migration from
   the ""X-"" name to a standardized name.  Migration, in turn, introduces
   interoperability issues (and sometimes security issues) because older
   implementations will support only the ""X-"" name and newer
   implementations might support only the standardized name.  To
   preserve interoperability, newer implementations simply support the
   ""X-"" name forever, which means that the unstandardized name has
   become a de facto standard (thus obviating the need for segregation
   of the name space into standardized and unstandardized areas in the

During that, you should try to get a deeper understanding of what the next level means. There are certain levels (63, 65, 68) whose promotions are significantly different than the other levels and can be intimidating, particularly to first-time leads. For example, at 63, your lead might have to justify the promo to your PUM, and at 65, your lead has to convince your discipline manager to justify it not only to your PUM but has to provide enough info about your comparable work to have it justified with all the discipline managers across your division at the calibration meeting.<p>Unless you are in an extraordinarily technically deep area (e.g. compiler frontend, database internals), you should not expect your lead to be an amazing manager. If they were, they'd have left you behind and be a manager of managers within ~3 years because there aren't nearly enough of those to go around.",1340708592

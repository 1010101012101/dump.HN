About every 10th person was selected to go through the scanner. Nobody opted out. Contrary to most reports, the TSA agents at both airports were pretty nice and helpful. At JFK, they were helping a number non-english speaking travelers speed their way through the line so they wouldn't miss their flight. If anything was off, a couple of the agents at SFO were too chipper at 6am, which made them seem slightly insane. Privacy and health concerns aside, an issue with this machine is that it does nothing to speed up the security line. If anything, it is slightly slower than the metal detector.<p>I wonder if this is really a cancer risk. For instance, I feel like living in Toxic Williamsburg is probably a worse cancer risk than going through the backscatter machine twice a year.<p><a href=""http://gothamist.com/2007/04/11/toxic_williamsb.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gothamist.com/2007/04/11/toxic_williamsb.php</a>",1289933993

You can call Kernel's methods on any object (usually - there are some cases where not) through <i>send</i>, e.g. <i>[].send(:puts, 10)</i> .. I was working with Sven Fuchs on some ""sandboxing"" stuff a couple of years ago and we discovered this little doozy! (Though it's possible to figure out by noting that <i>[].puts</i> tells you <i>private method `puts' called</i> and <i>send</i> gets you around that problem.)<p>Typically you pass a symbol as the first argument but a string works too which, I believe, would make my attack vector work. Going to try it now.<p><i>Update: /send/exec/date works as expected (and stops the server).</i>",1289933814

But after the surgery, it was fantastic.  If you can afford it (i.e. insurance or have the money), I'd highly recommend you go to a doctor.  It might not require surgery and only physical therapy.  After my surgery, my physical therapist and I came up with the following list for me.  YMMV.<p>Use a keyboard without the number pad.  With no number pad, your hand doesn't have to move far from the keyboard to get to the mouse (trackball in my case).<p>I've got foot pedals programmed to be the control and alt keys so I don't have to move my fingers off the main keys at all (except for shift.  I never could get used to using a footpad for shift).  I've been experimenting with a foot pad for backspace as that is the longest throw I have right now.<p>Exercise your fingers.  Get one of those stress balls and squeeze it.  For a long time, I used electronic todo lists or wrote pseudo-code in VIM when thinking about an idea.  Now I use notebooks, and I've taught myself to write with both hands (left hand is weak hand.  I can read it, but no one else can :).  So when I'm stuck or need to make a list, I'll write out what I need to accomplish.  I'll squeeze the ball with whatever hand I'm not writing with.<p>Stretch your fingers and wrists.  Before I start work in the morning, I'll stretch my fingers and wrists for 10 to 15 minutes.<p>I've got a stopwatch to time myself.  I'll only code for 1 hour and 50 minutes.  Then I'll stop, do nothing for 10 minutes (absolutely nothing.  I'll just sit with my eyes closed.  If I'm pairing, I'll turn over the keyboard), and then do my stretching exercises for 10 minutes.<p>One of my biggest contributors was posture.  I'd sit slumped so my arms were way higher than they should have been.  I've now taught myself to sit upright.  I still slip at this sometimes, but I can generally catch it before I've done it too long.<p>Like I said before, those items helped me.

That got rid of the problem for me after about three days.<p>At first I thought the improvement was due to the ergonomic form of the keyboard, but after using my MacBook Pro's built-in keyboard for months with no pain, I now think that my problem was just that my original cheap, foam-sprung keyboard was just awful for typing. So maybe the answer is to just get a better keyboard.<p>Additionally, posture and angle of forearms to the keyboard surface is also a factor with any keyboard. Your forearms should be parallel to the ground and your keyboard flat, at least that's what works for me. If your chair is too low this might be forcing you to contort your hands in order to type.<p>For example, my MacBook Pro's keyboard works fine for me, but the external Apple wireless keyboard (with the same type of keys) causes RSI very quickly.

And the actual markup generated is quite good.<p>You don't need to know or use MVVM to do Silverlight apps.  It can be useful, but I wouldn't try to learn that first.

In theory, this should provide feedback to the teacher to adjust the pace of the learning. In practice, the study program is set in stone and the students who cannot catch on their own will be left behind, no questions asked.<p>The only pass/fail test is at the end of the year, where everything is shoveled together. If the student completely fails to grok subject 3... but excels at subjects 1, 2 and 4. This liability gets lost in the numbers, remaining as a time bomb that will blow on his face in a couple of years when subject 3 is a building block of more complex stuff.<p>This problem is exacerbated by the fact that grading is extremely lax also. This is my personal opinion, any grade less than ""B"" shows knowledge in either immature (student needs to study more) or flawed (students have inaccurate assumptions that need to be detected and corrected by instructor) stage.

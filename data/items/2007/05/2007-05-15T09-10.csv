OH MY GOD! Its like you're brainwashed! <p>Let me ask you this- - you're buying a car.  You're going to use this car to deliver papers and make some money delivering pizza on the side.  You're going to build a little business here that's worth 10 times the value of the car after a year or two.<p>Do you go to the bank who gives you %100 of the purchase price of the car in exchange for %9 interest each year?  Or do you go to the local loan shark who charges you (""to stay competitive, of course"") %30-%40 of the value of the loan, plus-- if you decide to sell the car-- 4 times the value of the loan at liquidation? <p>YC says you go to the loan shark and pay %400 for your money.<p>Slashdot ""Trolls"" say ""that's way too much""... and you think they are engaging in bad math?!?!<p>",1179222708

22184,comment,21863,21872,0,0,BitGeek,,,"I think this comment shows everything that is asinine and vapid about the YC ""community"". <p>Ian Clarke invented freenet... the most successful peer-to-peer privacy network.  <p>And whether his businesses have been successful or not (I don't know, but I know you don't) he's been more successful than the members of this community.  He has far more users than reddit, for instance. <p>Its amazing that every disagreement or criticism of YC is met with the ""you're a failure"" or ""you're jealous"" or ""you're bitter"" response.<i></i> <p>Never a response on the point.<p>This is what has me increasingly believing that YC is a cult of personality-- its adherents don't make arguments, they repreat mantra.  Their motivation is not intellectual honesty-- but defense of their idol.<p>Please, prove me wrong!<p><i></i> These are the classic comebacks of kids.  Is this community made up of college students?  Is that the problem?

22183,comment,21907,21962,0,0,BitGeek,,,"The main objection of the ""trolls"" is the strident ideology being shown.  Here's one of my replies buried in the other thread:<p>Anybody who build their business on nights and weekends while working a fulltime job is someone who has shown a great deal of commitment.   I've done this, its damn hard... its hard not to let the startup wither away because you're too busy with your day job, and its hard not to loose interest after even 3 months of spending all your time on your job or your other job with little time for anything else.<p>Show me someone who built thier company that way, and I'll be interested in putting money in. <p>YC seems to attract and be geared for, kids in college who want a summer job with the prospect of glamorous VC money afterwards.  It doesn't matter to them that they might get a raw deal-- cause they don't have much invested in it in the first place.   And ther's nothing wrong with that.<p>The problem is that these kids are so adamant and smug that this is The One True Way To Do A Tech Startup-- that making these foolish short term choices in pursuit of a billion dollar dream is obviously right... and building a net worth of $10M by building a $3M/a year real buisiness is a ""lifestyle"" business-- a failure in their eyes.  They are naieve and strident and there is no getting thru to them because Paul Graham has them mezmerized by the tune he's playing.<p>YC is a great summer camp for entreprenurial college students.  But all the bashing of other ways of going about it that they do are so misguided... and the focus on only high risk, low probability business models seems misguided.",1179222154

22179,comment,21819,22171,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Howdy Bit,<p>""Yes, I mean ""build your thing."" This is NOT the ""YC model"". The YC model is ""build a demo so you can get VC money"".""<p>Where did you get that idea?  Paul actively discourages YC companies to seek VC money, and is very nearly hostile to the groups who don't launch product by the end of the program.<p>""You're still assuming that the purpose of your company is to demo your way into a job (eg: get ""big"" funding.)""<p>Nope, you haven't bothered to look at what me and my company (a YC funded company) are doing.  We've launched.  We sell products to real customers for real money.  We support them like a mofo.  We add features and make it easier to use every week.  Then we lather-rinse-repeat.  We're building a serious business, and YC has been very encouraging about it.<p>You've got the wrong end of the stick on everything YC is doing, as far as I can tell.<p>""Sorry, I didn't mean network with your peers (if your peers are under 25).""<p>Did you miss where I said I'm old.  I'm 32, and this is my second company.  I mean exactly what I said.<p>""but your coming off like Mark Zuckerberg... there are great bright valuable people in business.""<p>Now you're just talking crazy.  I've frequently made fun of Zuckerberg here on News.YC.  Partly because I'm old.  I've made no suggestion that you should only talk to young people.  I am suggesting that hanging out with other smart people starting companies is the smartest thing you can do.<p>I stand by everything I said about the YC events that were open to all comers.  I'm not saying you can't gain anything from talking to business-oriented folks...I'm just saying I don't find any value in meeting with ""business idiots"" who want me to implement their dumbass ideas for them in exchange for 5% of their company.<p>Business idiots are not the same as business folks who are useful to talk to.  YC brings it on the latter, and skips the former entirely.<p>""Nothing wrong with hanging out with other 25 year olds, but that's not the point.""<p>Again, I'm 32.  My co-founder is 33.  I'm cantankerous, and don't like kids.  If there were any in the WFP, I managed to avoid noticing.  The YC companies I've met are serious folks.<p>""And you will NOT find them at a YC infest.... because these are people who are running successful companies.""<p>Oh, right.  I met Joe Kraus...umm, at YC.  Mark Fletcher...hmm, that was at YC, too.  Evan Williams...argh, also at YC.  Greg McAdoo...holy crap, YC.  Ron Conway...I'll be damned, at YC.<p>""The more people associated with the program act like stepford hackers the more you're going to see ""trolling"" ...and the less time I'll spend here... whenever I've expressed something not %100 in line with the PG ideology, the responses have been vehemenant and identical... not counter arguments, but repetition of the ideology.""<p>I don't know anything about that, and it doesn't matter to me whether you stick around.  ;-)<p>Where'd you get the the idea that Paul encourages any of the things you suggest?  Certainly not in his essays...they're anti-VC, and always focus on building something people want.  Early exits are a part of the strategy for a lot of YC companies, that's true, but I don't see where there's anything wrong with that.  It's also clear to me that YC doesn't demand early exits (we are not an early exit company, and have never presented ourselves as one).",1179221094

Its totaly in your control... move on, stop hanging out around the YC crowd and go build your company.  Don't let YC determine your fate... they had their chance and passed.<p>The absense of successful rejected is simply a factor of the YC propaganda engine only talking about those accepted.  ITs too early for stories about the ones that got away to be well known-- hell, there aren't any real successes  from the program yet (which is also because its new.)<p>",1179220684

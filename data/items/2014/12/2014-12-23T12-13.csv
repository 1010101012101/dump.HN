I have no doubt that up-to-date maps will be no problem, considering these vehicles constantly collect centimeter-accurate 3D maps of where they drive and upload them to Google.<p>And being able to pull over to the side of the road to pick someone up?

The court&#x27;s argument seems to follow contractualism (e.g. Searle, see 1), and your objection is a consequentialist one, as given by Singer in Practical Ethics.<p>I find the latter reasoning much better, but think that the whole argument could have been avoided by asking another question: instead of &quot;does the primate have rights?&quot; we could ask &quot;do humans have the right to lock up a primate&quot;. In the latter case, it would have been fairly easy to reason that the interests of the human (seeing a monkey in a zoo) are in no way vital and cannot establish a right, without getting into the question whether the monkey has rights.<p>[1] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/#ConProAni"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/#ConProAni</a>",1419338899

8787908,comment,8784304,8784595,0,0,orbifold,,,"To someone from a nation responsible for a large genocide in the 20th century and at least one world war, Germany, the notion that you could &quot;love your country&quot; has only become non controversial again, recently. For example, flags are really only displayed by the population for major sport events, like the world cup and not for National Day. In fact a major part of political indoctrination in school was that the idea of the nation state is largely a thing of the past, nationalism is &quot;dangerous&quot; and that the future is the European Union. The majority of the political elite can&#x27;t wait to see a &quot;United States of Europe&quot; emerge and says so openly at various occasions.<p>This is to illustrate, that the perception of the country you live in largely depends on the indoctrination you received in your youth and the overall agenda. In most countries of Europe strong nationalistic tendencies are inconvenient for long term political goals, so  the emphasis is on international cooperation and adherence to international law. In fact German politicians rarely state they &quot;love their country&quot; and would be crucified, if they described their country as &quot;exceptional&quot;.<p>The US instead has been a rogue actor for much of its existence, basically ignores international law, routinely blocks inconvenient UN resolutions, has supported some of the most oppressive regimes in recent history (South Africa, Honduras, Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia come to mind) has constantly waged war and bullied countries in Middle and South America.<p>Restricted to foreign politics there is little America justifiably can be proud of in recent history and yet there is this whole quasi religion around the USA as a nation, &quot;manifest destiny&quot; etc., that apparently serves as a mental block even among many educated Americans to coolly and rationally evaluate the appalling record of most of their administrations in the past 50 years and maybe come to the conclusion that you should have persecuted many, who claimed they served your country and &quot;loved it&quot; a long time ago.",1419338852

My interpretation of that statement would be that rights are conferred to species as a whole, not individuals, and it matters whether the species as a whole can bear legal responsibility.  Just as you can&#x27;t take rights away from individual members of a species that can do that, you can&#x27;t give rights to individuals of a species that can&#x27;t.  How you define what species can and what can&#x27;t is of course the clincher in that case.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s a pretty decent way to look at it. It means all that is required for an entire species to be given personal rights is to prove that they can fulfill the obligations that come with them.

They can mine their bitcoins at me all day every day, but I shall not hand over one potato! (Unless I feel sorry for them)<p>I am frightened of someone with a machine gun (or half a dozen mates with battle axes) and I would probably agree to share my farm produce with them in exchange for them not killing me and my family and for them preventing other people from killing me and my family.<p>This was the partially the origin of gold&#x27;s value. The monopoly of production and distribution of gold and the tie to radical threatened violence. In addition gold is pretty and can be used in electronics, but these are minor components in its value. Mostly we retain the cultural memory of a time when digging up gold was done by slaves owned by folk who had a propensity to murder, and therefore having gold enabled the deployment of murder.<p>Bitcoin might have the same sort of association to value as gold once did if one day state actors decided that it was an appropriate proxy to violence. Non state actors are may also decide to use it that way - &quot;honour your bitcoin debt or find a horses head on your pillow!&quot; However, if they do/did then they would find that eventually state actors would step in and take over control. The problem for bitcoin is that it is not good as a fiat currency by design, so those that have the capability to do violence are unlikely to adopt it as a fiat currency in the long term.<p>It is not good because it is deflationary due to the finite supply of bitcoin and the increasing difficulty of finding new ones. This is a bit worse than the situation with gold because we might find a big load of new gold somewhere, while we know exactly how many bitcoins we might ever extract, and we can say more or less when we will get the last one.<p>This is bad news for contracts underpinned by violence, because it means that the longer the contract is the harder it will be to fulfil it, because the greater the demands on the supply of the items required to fulfil. Thus, if I sign up to take a loan from my bitcoin obsessed local feudal overlord to build a barn or other item enabling wealth creation then I will have to know that I will produce more wealth from it in the future than I could if I were to have it today. Otherwise the value of the contract to my lord will be negative, so he/she won&#x27;t hand over the loan.<p>So bitcoin as a fiat currency will be a disincentive to wealth creation. Like gold eventually ended up being when the early mines got worked out and extraction got really hard.<p>This is not to say that crypto-currency might not be adopted by state actors, but it is to say that bitcoin won&#x27;t be adopted by state actors or a functioning underground economy either. This means that it is a bit less good than gold as a store of value now, and a huge lot less good than gold as a store of value in the past. Gold is living on borrowed time as a value store, bitcoin has no time as a value store.",1419338040

Cross-reference the books to find other possible subjects to search.  Later, online catalogs (computers accessible typically only at the library) could make this far faster.<p>⚫ For news items, title searches in news indices.  Later, Lexis-Nexis.  If it was a major story and you knew the dates, looking through issues of major news publications (e.g., TIME, Newsweek, etc.) could often turn up hits.<p>⚫ Bibliographies.  Let someone else do your research for you.  Cross-comparing bibliographies often turned up the key / seminal works in an area, where you could then use ...<p>⚫ Citations indices.  These show where a given work was referenced.  So if you find a seminal work, you now find the works (generally journal articles) which reference <i>it</i>.<p>⚫ You&#x27;re also probably starting to recognize key authors at this point -- in most fields there are a limited number who really know their stuff.  So you can start running author searches on their other writings.<p>⚫ If the library has open stacks, stack surfing can be quite interesting and serendipitous.  Find the area containing books of interest and pull interesting titles.  This is limited to the books which are <i>on</i> the shelves, so it&#x27;s biased <i>away</i> from the more popular material.  Depending on just how popular the material is, it can still be quite useful.<p>Though those are the &quot;old school&quot; methods (1960s - 1990s for the most part), they&#x27;re still generally applicable today.  I like to research a field for a while until I start turning up the same names repeatedly.  At that point, you&#x27;ve got a general feel for the size of the area.  It&#x27;s possible to dive in and read in depth.<p>I also have a personal bias for <i>older</i> works -- I like to dig in deep.  Much more recent material <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> change the understanding all that much, and you can often find that there&#x27;s been a significant degree of bias or skew in how original works are interpreted.  Reading them with your own eyes can often reveal what you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise know, or can give you an unbiased (or at least your <i>own</i> bias) of the original work&#x27;s meaning and focus.<p>Many fields are <i>highly</i> skewed to a present / current bias.  While it doesn&#x27;t hurt to note where recent research has actually advanced the state of the art or changed understanding (and curiously:  it&#x27;s in the study of some of the oldest events, particularly of Earth&#x27;s geological history and that of the Universe that we&#x27;ve seen stunning progress over the past 40 years), in human, political, and philosophical fields I find that <i>at the very least</i> having a familiarity with works going back 200-2000 years (and occasionally further) can be quite useful.  There are some very persistent aspects to  human behavior which remain unchanged.  And yes, there are ancient beliefs which have proven themselves quite wrong.<p>But that itself might serve as a caution -- the same human nature that generated those ancient errors persists today.",1419336747

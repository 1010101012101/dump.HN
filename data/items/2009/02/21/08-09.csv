My statement is so non-controversial that I have no problem saying that anyone who disagrees with it truly has no idea what they're talking about.<p>The ""marginal revolution"" is one of the major events in the history of economics.<p>EDIT - here's some useful wikipedia links:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility</a><p>EDIT #2 - paragraph 3 from wikipedia:<p>Different labor theories of value prevailed amongst classical economists through to the mid-19th century. It is especially associated with Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Since that time, it is most often associated with Marxian economics; while modern mainstream economics replaces it by the marginal utility approach.",1235206404

Combined.<p>But who cares about such things?",1235204646

You can use the system that is used in Google webmasters tools - users can confirm their ownership by adding specific document or meta-tag. Also - registration system's usability is not perfect.

As in, it doesn't really describe how the article talks about how Amazon aims at increasing its business through a better user experience and better customer service and thinks of long term growth over short term wins.<p>Regardless, i couldn't agree more. I've had two experiences involving customer service with Amazon that turned me into a life-time loyal customer. One time, i even got a book completely free even though it wasn't their fault. And they did this even though i am an international buyer who probably doesn't spend that much anyway.<p>Because of this, their concept of keeping the customer happy is burned into my head(and hopefully into my business plan later). Amazon still shines with this concept even though it is supposed to be the norm in doing business.<p>If it weren't for the high shipping costs(international), i would prefer buying whatever i can from Amazon to show them my appreciation and support.",1235203326

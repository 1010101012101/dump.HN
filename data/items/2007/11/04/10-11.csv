At their current share price they can acquire any company -- and I mean ANY company -- for little or no cost. Killing little free411 after first cozying up to them is mean-spirited and, if Google continues to behave like this in the future, will hurt the company's reputation long-term. Maybe having a good reputation means little to Google, but it should.</i><p><i>It's time to grow up, kids.</i><p>So Google should acquire all startups that are affected by its services, even if there's nothing to gain from the acquisition... because it's the nice thing to do? I'm all for going out of your way to be nice, but let's double check who needs to grow up here...",1194173953

IMO, Joe Armstrong in this (previously submitted) video talks a lot of sense on this issue.--> <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=351659"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=351659</a><p>My motivation for posting this is simply that I would love for Arc to succeed in it's objectives.  But to be a '100 year language' I imagine it would have to first thrive in the next 10 years; and to do that it must be seen as a great language for tomorrow's world and not today's.  From what I've seen so far of Arc I get nothing but good vibes and it would be a shame for it to be sidelined in the multi-core rush just around the corner.<p>My apologies if this has been discussed before.  I am new here, couldn't figure out how to search past articles and Google just returns this home page.",1194172119

It seems odd to go just be the number of countries and disregard the population size. Population-wise, the largest of those countries are Indonesia (pop. 228m, 86% Muslim), Pakistan (172m, 97%) and Bangladesh (162m, 89%).

3364131,comment,3363259,3364065,2,0,mayanksinghal,,,"I think you are mixing points though the central cause remains the same. Firstly, medicine nearly always had enough women though as nurses (male nurses are still minority) and them gaining equal role, responsibility and returns was probably a slow process (I wouldn't know, I am not related to the field). The point I was making was because the very basic of the privileges that were pointed out in the article was regarding (1) Easier jobs/promotions for men (2) Men saying that women got it because they are women.<p>There has been a lot of efforts to bring women at par with men in terms of returns they gain. And there have also been efforts that aim at increasing their count. Both, are required. You are pointed out at the first category of efforts and I am pointed out the consequences of affirmation actions that belong to the second category. There are two forces at play here - (1) Discriminatory, against women. (2) Affirmative action, for women. Now the second point in the privileges is because affirmative actions have a very obvious but mean side effect. It leads to undermining the potential of those who receive benefit from them because affirmative action is done at an expense of some people who otherwise deserved the benefit if <i>standard</i> parameters of judgement are used. This leads to unrest and hence my refute to privilege (2). While my refute to privilege (1) was the overwhelming of discriminatory forces by affirmative actions in <i>my</i> experience from <i>my</i> point of view. This is as biased an opinion as possible, hence you can choose to ignore it. But if many seem to face a similar experience, that would mean that affirmative action needs to be done at a lower level or be stopped for it has served its purpose.",1324125405

We don't actually have a problem with the close() behavior differing between implementations, we have a problem because there is no way to determine the correct course of action afterward.<p>For HP-UX, it's ""close it again"".<p>For AIX, it's apparently ""everything is fine, don't close it again"". Linux, too.<p>That could be OK, even when undocumented, IF we had a way to discover what had occurred. But we don't. close() isn't broken because it can behave in multiple ways that can't be predicted in advance, it's broken because there's no safe way to proceed.<p>And by the way, we do know something about the target when we're writing POSIX-compliant code. We know the target is POSIX-compliant. That's the whole point of POSIX.",1324123286

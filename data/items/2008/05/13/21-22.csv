189050,comment,188489,188489,0,0,tdavis,,,"After living in suburbia for 23 years (and finally getting out this month, thank ""God"") I can attest to most of this. One thing PG doesn't mention is that some people flat never grow out of the idyllic view of the world that this segregated space presents OR become so impossibly jaded that they're damaged beyond all repair.<p>One friend of mine managed to have both of these happen. Not only does he have an idyllic view of the world, at least in how it _should_ be, but he's also become extremely jaded, having found out that most of his views are wrong (despite still clinging to them). These are often entirely contradictory. For example, he believes in true love and that if you _truly_ love someone you could never, ever do anything to hurt them. On the other hand, he's seen enough relationships and enough cheating and other ""nastiness"" that he's jaded to the point that he believes (his words) ""all women are whores.""<p>I would argue that you have less of a chance of becoming extremely jaded if you grow up in a societal sub-section that neither attempts to hide the gruesome truths of the world from youth nor presents them on every street corner. In my humble opinion, suburbia is too close to the former extreme.",1210714187

Google video is good because it supports long videos, but some of their servers seem unreliable and occasionally videos fail to load.  Blip is good but they don't support seeking well (i.e. you sometimes wont be able to jump ahead to unbuffered parts of the video).<p>Youtube is actually the most reliable, but as you mention only supports small videos.  One option is to break long videos up into 10min chunks and then stitch them together on Omnisio (we support compilations of multiple videos).  It's a bit of a pain I know.<p>We are looking into support for other video sites - I wish there was a perfect answer :)",1210714094

189027,comment,188942,188942,0,0,neilc,,,"I'm not sure that I would say ""vendors are bad for security"", but I think the practice of distributions applying a load of patches to upstream software is very unwise. Patches are warranted when they are backporting upstream changes or for integration with the rest of the distribution, but random changes (as this one was) shouldn't be made by the distributor -- they should be fed back to the upstream authors, who are in the best position to assess whether or not the change is sane. Furthermore, when a distribution changes something but doesn't feed those changes back upstream, it creates incompatibilities between different distributions of the same upstream package. For example, in the past the FreeBSD PostgreSQL port had all sorts of wacky patches (like changing the block size, or using the ICU library) that weren't accepted upstream, which lead to exactly this problem. Although the patches were optional, this is just not a game that vendors should be in.",1210712842

The last one to try this model of both making hardware and licensing the OS was Apple during the nineties and we all know how that ended.<p>They need to make money from Motorola (currently it's at breakeven) to justify the purchase price for shareholders, but without pissing off the other OEMs like Samsung/HTC.

Why would anyone be interested in purchasing a failed-to-launch tablet product when Android tablets sell well and the software is free (outside of patent deals with trolls)? The distinction of having your own software didn't work for HP, so why should it work for Samsung/HTC/etc?<p>However! I think the big sale is yet to come. When HP bought Palm, they acquired their 1,600-ish patents as well. Palm was a very early player in the smartphone market, so it's conceivable that this portfolio contains some attractive property. Having paid $1.2 billion for Palm, either selling this patent portfolio outright, or taking the Lodsys route seems plausible. Given the heat around patent acquisition right now, they'd probably do pretty well; maybe even exceeding their original purchase price.",1313697424

Two postings I responded where saying in effect that culturally Israel is similar to Europe, one of them was yours.  I said that is true, except when it comes to its occupation.  With regards to the occupation, its is related human rights issues, Israel is very unlike modern Europe.  That is a completely true observation and it was appropriate in the context I posted it.<p>#2. A third response was with regards to someone else saying that Israel played in the European league because it wanted to avoid matches with Syria and Iran, but the actual reason is that Israel viewed very negatively by the majority of its neighbors in the Arab world primarily because of its treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied territories.  It isn't just about Syria and Iran, but rather about Jordan, Egypt and basically every other state in the region.

Reproducing my comment here:<p>---------------<p>Thanks for the response! I just have a couple points to make:<p>---<p><i>""Seemingly reacting to this response, Poole’s blog post appeared the next day instead of the aforementioned 26th""</i><p>Yes. It was a reaction to the bug being marked public, which meant anyone could view the full details of the issue.<p>---<p><i>""Providing two good reasons for this is not difficult and I am sure there are others:</i><p><i>1. I don’t want to see anything to do with HTML if I’m not doing web-based programming with PHP (such as CLI).</i><p><i>2. I want my error messages to provide me with precise information. I do not want an error message to arbitrarily encode problematic code. If the user provided <s>test</s> then I want to see <s>test</s>. I do not want to see &lt;s&gt;test&lt;/s&gt; since that is not what was submitted and, possibly, not what the problem is.""</i><p>As I pointed out on Hacker News, the CLI interpreter does not HTML encode fatal errors, warnings, or notices. The CGI interpreter DOES encode fatal errors and warnings, but not notices. As such, your points aren't really applicable to the situation.<p>---<p><i>""No, Mr. Poole. A decent sysadmin has better things to worry about than PHP configurations. Regardless, sysadmins should be perfectly aware of the stupidity of letting display_errors remain enabled on a production environment; the same should be said for any developer worth their salt. There simply isn’t a valid excuse and this is a perfect example of why configurations differ between development and production environments.""</i><p>1. You're using a logical fallacy to make your point: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=No_true_Scotsman&oldid=445159436"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=No_true_Scotsman&#...</a><p>2. Many shared hosts do enable display_errors by default.<p>3. I'm not arguing that this is a feasible attack to pull off against most applications: it most certainly is not. I'm arguing that it shouldn't be possible to pull it off at all, even in the small percentage of applications that might be affected. There is no good reason PHP should be displaying this information unsanitized.<p>---<p><i>""How is this a proof of concept of an undefined index or notice?""</i><p>You seem to have missed the line<p><pre><code>    $message = $messages[$_GET['message']];\n</code></pre>\nThe string 1<script>alert(1)</script> passes the initial if statement but will trigger an undefined index notice on that line of code, with the name of the index under user control.<p>---<p><i>""Recommending programmers turn off their error display without actually addressing the bad code is not good advice at all and something I would hardly expect from someone who works in web application security.""</i><p>First you tell me my recommendation is common sense, then you tell me it's bad advice. Make up your mind ;-)<p>Anyway, as I said on Hacker News, my original report only focused on the ""Undefined index"" message, which is a fairly benign issue (albeit a sign of sloppy coding). The other examples were discovered later and were only mentioned to demonstrate that PHP notices in general had an issue.<p>I completely disagree with your assessment of my recommendation though. Telling people to disable display_errors prevents the issue at hand, the cross-site scripting, from ever occurring. In contrast, telling people to go find and fix any PHP notices in their code is a reactive solution: it only works until the next piece of sloppy code gets checked in, at which point the site is vulnerable again. And of course, as you've said repeatedly, display_errors should not be enabled in production in any case.",1313697168

2900779,comment,2900172,2900471,26,0,stephenjudkins,,,"Rubinius and PyPy take quite different approaches to solving the same general problem. It's inaccurate to analogize them.<p>Rubinius specifies a bytecode (see <a href=""http://rubini.us/doc/en/virtual-machine/instructions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubini.us/doc/en/virtual-machine/instructions/</a>) and implements a VM that executes this bytecode. The VM is written in C++. The main difference between Rubinius and other Ruby implementations is that nearly everything else is written in Ruby. The lexer, parser, and parts that compile the AST to bytecode is all written in pure Ruby. Further, large parts of the standard library and Ruby language that are implemented in lower-level languages in other implementations are instead written as runtime-level Ruby. However, large and important parts of the infrastructure (including GC and memory allocation) are written in C++.<p>PyPy takes an altogether different approach. It specifies a restricted subset of Python known as ""RPython"". Basically, it's statically-typed Python. There is also a ""compiler"" (also called a ""JIT generator""), written in pure Python, that compiles an arbitrary interpreter written in RPython into a fast JIT. (See <a href=""http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/04/tutorial-writing-interpreter-with-pypy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/04/tutorial-writing-interp...</a> for an example of writing a very simple, small interpreter in RPython.) A cool feature of RPython is that while there must a statically RPython AST to compile, during the ""eval"" stage you can leverage the full dynamic capabilities of Python.<p>The second part of PyPy is a full Python interpreter written in RPython. Since RPython is a subset of Python, you can actually run this interpreter sandboxed inside any other Python implementation, albeit very slowly. The PyPy toolchain compiles this down to a very fast Python interpreter that features JIT compilation, among other cool features.<p>The neat part of PyPy (in contrast to Rubinius) is that the toolchain part is largely decoupled and generalized away from Python-the-language. Conceivably, one could write ANY language in RPython (or what's compiled down to RPython) and have a fast JIT interpreter. Experimental language features can be added and changed (see the source code for the different garbage collectors in PyPy) with little mucking with the low-level VM.<p>Rubinius is a neat, pragmatic project that could turn into one of the best Ruby implementations around. However, it's not breaking new ground like PyPy is.",1313697036

2900693,comment,2900134,2900134,2,0,noelwelsh,,,"Latency is a big issue for the app we're building [plug at the bottom]. Ideally we'd serve content in under 200ms to users around the world. I really can't see how to achieve this without either crazy Javascript hacks or Akamai. Looking up benchmarks suggests Akamai CDN has latency of around 10ms vs 100-200ms for everyone else (!!!) The killer feature, however, is Akamai's edge computing -- there are only two companies I know of that offer this. Unfortunately Akamai are stuck in the crappy business model where everything -- even basic information -- requires you to contact them. So we have to go through the bullshit salesperson theatre while they work out how much they can shake us down for. Not really what a small startup wants. So crazy JS hacks it will be, I expect.<p>Op plug:

I'm right here!",,"This year, my county school board is offering ten students the opportunity to be part of an official, school sponsored internship program (translate this as legal absence for work time and a justification to my parents on why coding isnt a waste of my time) where I can work as a free intern with any company that will cooperate. Most students work with local companies that operate in the field of their choice, but I face a dilemma. There is not a large number (or any I know of specifically) of computer science/hacker/developer companies around where I live. So, if there are any companies or startups out there looking for free, offsite intern work from an enthusiastic 17 year old programmer out there, Im willing to fill that space! If youre interested, I can contact my school board and see if I would be allowed to intern for you. You can read my resume at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8525185/jgoldsteinresume.pdf, browse my GitHub at github.com/mrjordangoldstein, and read my blog at jordangoldstein.wordpress.com. This should provide you with an accurate picture of my experience, programming skill, level of education, and general qualifications, but if you need more information, I can be reached via email at mr.jordangoldstein@gmail.com. I really enjoy coding, and have been doing so for a number of years. I hope that as an intern I could not just learn, but provide a major contribution to whatever I am part of. I understand that, being 17 and offsite, I may not seem like a potential help, but I would work to the best of my ability on whatever task is needed to fulfill a useful role.<p>Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you,<p>Jordan Goldstein<p>P.S.

Do you eat there all the time?<p>Morten's invested in some 'free' PR here. Basically they know this guy is legit because he has a history with them, further they can estimate is future business 'stream' since they know how often he eats there. A simple affinity card where you get 'stars' for each visit and a free meal on your tenth or whatever, works exactly this way.<p>There are three HUGE things to learn from this story:<p>1) In order to know whose important you have to know who your customers are, it helps if you can tie a customer identity to a social network identity.<p>2) Keeping frequent customers happy brings in business because whenever they are in the conversation 'Where should we [consume/use/buy] [service/product]?' they recommend your product or service.<p>3) It might cost $100,000 for a 'small' advertising run or PR stunt, something like this probably costs less than $100. In terms of customer acquisition costs its hugely efficient relative to broader and necessicarily more dilute activities.<p>So I don't doubt for a minute that Mortens got their money's worth here.

However, I would point out that these meetings were attended by a whole team of contractors, each with their own computers configured with their own choice of OS and browser. Moreover, they were held in a variety of different locations, and indeed across several different locations at once via teleconference on some occasions. In other words, it wasn't one very serious problem, it was probably a whole bunch of little problems that caused specific features to be inaccessible to certain locations or not to work properly on specific client platforms during a particular period. (Before anyone jumps in, clearly everyone's Internet connections were fine during the teleconferences, because we were using Internet-based conference software to run them...)<p>My point is only that it's a bit rich to claim a 99.984% uptime based, presumably, on having servers available, if the code that is running on those servers isn't properly quality controlled so that customers can actually use it to do real work. Just because most of the people on the team can connect fine, it still screws up the meeting if a few others can't follow along.

In this case using stacks instead of recursion appears to have gotten in the way of that and might count as premature optimization. (I might be completely barking up the wrong tree as far as your particular code goes, again, but code described as generating all possible solutions could be made efficient without much change.)<p>For example, the memoized word-splitting code at <a href=""http://norvig.com/ngrams/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/ngrams/</a> compared to the recent discussion here on HN of doing it with dynamic programming (as an interview problem).",1313694171

I checked out your github, but didn't find any examples of how your system works.<p>I think the ideal way for builds to work is to be able to define packages (that can be source, libraries, data, a genrule that runs a shell command) and the dependencies of that package (references to other packages).  The build system should just know how to build various kinds of code (or maybe have one spot for configuring how your Java build runs, for example).  It should also know what output files to look for, so that it can avoid re-building files over and over again.  For the common languages, it can deduce where the built file should be.  For genrules, the developer can specify what the output files are.<p>Issues I had with ant: 
Ant requires you to specify the mechanics for how to build everything.  It is difficult to impossible to express more complicated build rules (e.g. arbitrary shell commands were a huge pain).  It also was very slow for incremental builds involving multiple projects, and it did not provide incremental builds for most build artifacts.  For example, if an 'ant' rule generates a file, it will do so every time unless you write custom code to skip doing that based on hash or timestamp.<p>Ant is fine for one blog of code, but when you want to stop building the world, I find things get very difficult.  It became painfully slow to build stuff, and difficult to write build files correctly as our system grew.<p>I don't have a ton of experience with other systems, but they seem to share a lot of the same problems.<p>One of the closest ones I saw was gyp (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/gyp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/gyp/</a>), but it didn't support Java",1313694103

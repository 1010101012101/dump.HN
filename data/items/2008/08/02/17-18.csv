Wait, that's what I'm doing right now.<p>ISPs are built on statistical multiplexing. They pay something like $40/Mbps/month and resell that bandwidth for around one tenth that price. If ISPs had enough capacity to satisfy all their customers simultaneously, they have to increase prices or decrease speeds enormously. If 6M service suddenly cost $200/month, then any kind of multimedia on the Net dies immediately. Statistical multiplexing benefits almost all Internet users (whose traffic is bursty), so it's not going away.",1217699793

Moving in that direction will at least lessen the problem. :)<p>That's kind of what I mean about power. For example, if there are people in charge of the economy -- with power over it -- that's a problem and people will want to pay them to use the power to their benefit. But there needn't be anyone with power of that sort.",1217699343

265095,comment,264943,264943,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I agree with the article except for those 2 paragraphs:<p>""<i>Norvig once wrote that the existence of design patterns is a sign of weakness in a language. I think he was wrong there. Sure, certain patterns are only necessary because a language don't allow to archive a certain goal directly by some build-in concept. But if you build it in, you would quickly discover other patterns 'a level above' instead of getting rid of those pesky design patterns. So we always have patterns, it's simply unadvoidable.</i>""<p>The problem is when you have to ""hand-compile"" a pattern repeatedly because the language doesn't let you abstract it away. Closures and macros let you codify most of those patterns once and for all.<p>""<i>A concrete example: Java uses the ""Iterator pattern"" quite frequently. Now in functional programming this pattern is quite useless. We simply write map and fold functions and don't need no ""iterator"". Hah! But hey, isn't ""writing a map and a fold function"" not also a design pattern? All we need to do is to call it the ""map and fold""-pattern. Using this pattern is common knowledge for every user of functional programming languages - so it's good to teach this pattern novices in functional programming right from the beginning.</i>""<p>But I don't have to reimplement map and fold every time I need to use it, I just need to call it. Whereas most of the time what we call a ""design pattern"" is something you have to reimplement all across the system by hand.",1217699185

265090,comment,264971,265089,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Totally. Our lawmakers are given an incentive system that often puts their interests in direct opposition to ours. People over time will trend toward their own interests.<p>It's not so much that we cannot give them power (or want not to) as that we must do so while aligning their interests with ours. One example (and I'm not sure I support this) would be to force all campaigns to be government funded. Find every possible reason why lobbyists give money and stop it.",1217698997
265089,comment,264971,265070,0,0,qqq,,,"I agree with most of what you say. But consider again those cases where an individual legislator ""puts his own interest first"". In those cases, our <i>system of government</i> put officials in a situation where they have a conflict of interest. That is a flaw in our system of Government and should not be blamed on the malice of any individual. Whatever you do in a <i>conflict of interest</i> there was no single, clear path to follow, so no one can blame you too much, and if you choose the wrong path it's an understandable mistake.<p>If you don't want people to use power, don't give them power. It's not, individually, their fault.<p>I do not wish to defend out and out corruption, but that's relatively uncommon compared to simple conflicts of interest. Most people are selfish, <i>and there's nothing wrong with that</i>, and what's going wrong is asking them to make terrible choices between themselves and others.",1217698806
265088,comment,264686,265027,0,0,jrockway,,,"For every excessively verbose identifier in CL, I can give you another that's excessively short.  I won't defend any of CL's design, it's horrible.  But it's not a major problem for actually using the language, you can rename whatever function you want, or have your editor type it for you.<p>As for the parentheses, I don't see any excess.<p><pre><code>    (let (foo bar) ...)\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>   (let ((foo 0)(bar 1)) ...)\n</code></pre>\nare both useful.  I would hate to have to write:<p><pre><code>   (let (foo nil bar nil) ...)\n</code></pre>\njust because you're afraid of a few parentheses.   It is easy to type and easy to read.  (foo nil bar nil) is, IMHO, nearly unreadable.<p>Edited to add: Another reason I like the ((var binding)...) syntax is because it keeps the core language as unambiguious as possible.  If I want to have an Arc-like binding operator, I can just write one and use that:<p><pre><code>   (my-let (foo 1 bar 2 baz 3) (+ foo bar baz)) ; ==> 6</code></pre>",1217698773
265087,comment,264943,264943,0,0,Darmani,,,"The author claims that if a language has features that allow patterns to be automated, there will still be patterns. Perhaps that's true, but the logic seems to be that more-than-necessary code-duplication is acceptable because eliminating 100% of code duplication is impossible -- certainly not a hacker's worldview. That Ruby needs to explicitly bind a variable to the result of an expression in an if statement due to lack of ability to implement effective anaphora does not excuse Java's need to manually implement what in Ruby is just ""include Singleton"".<p>(Whenever a post comes up defending Design Patterns, it's also obligatory that someone pull out this link: <a href=""http://blog.plover.com/prog/design-patterns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.plover.com/prog/design-patterns.html</a> .)",1217698701

265084,comment,264971,264971,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The argument that torrent users degrade the network for other users is tenuous at best, and I wish someone would start calling people out on it.<p>If the ISP says I have a 6m/768k broadband line, then I should be able to saturate that limit to my heart's content, with whatever I want to download/upload. If it degrades the local network somehow, that is the ISP's fault, not mine, and my neighbors are free to be angry at the ISP for an unreliable connection.<p>What is the point of having a connection that you can't use to its potential? If torrent users really are degrading the network, then lower the speed caps for the given price tier, as you have obviously oversold capacity. Or, better yet, upgrade the network. Laying a guilt trip on people for 'using too much of something they paid for' is just retarded.",1217698567

While it cannot reduce the xml-sit-ups, the Eclipse plugin does simplify their maintenance.  I've not yet toyed with EJB3, so I have no comment in that respect.  The other specific benefit of Spring is that the .NET side of the shop has the Spring port which eases the conceptual hurdles as engineers bounce from project to project.

265070,comment,264971,265055,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't believe that. Most cases in which the government is harmful are caused by individuals putting their own interests above that of their constituencies. ""The Government"" is not an organism and it's a very common mistake to think of it (or a corporation) as one. It's a group of individuals many of whom have to be reelected to maintain their status.<p>Farm subsidies exist, even though every economist says they should not, because congressmen like the bucks passed to them by the agricultural lobbies, because those bucks help them get reelected. Etc.<p>For a real interesting read, pick up Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food. It explains how the interplay between government officials who meant well and ones clinging to power through corporate dollars degraded our country's diet to the point where it's significantly less healthy than that of indigenous tribes who eat nothing but red meat. It's neat how a government mandate to eat less meat instead became one to eat more carbs.",1217697700

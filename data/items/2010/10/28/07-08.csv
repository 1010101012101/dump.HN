What is the risk/reward ratio of the majority of the populous zooming around in personal automobiles as opposed to pooling resources for effective (and well-maintained) public transit? In many of the places where public transit languished while automobile usage took off it had <i>far</i> more to do with the prestige of owning a car. Using public transit meant you were poor, but having a car (or multiple cars!) was a status symbol.  Why do you think that you can find extremely 'pimped out' cars in the drive-ways of houses that are falling apart in places like Detroit?  Why do I get teenagers/20-somethings (infrequently) yelling things like, ""I got wheels baby! WHoooo!"" (or similar) when I'm walking along a busy street? The car is a status symbol a hell of a lot more than it is a utility device (do you <i>really</i> need to drive 5 blocks to the store to pick up beer and drive back home?)",1288252751

1842124,comment,1841462,1841462,0,0,Orva,,,"Using IDEs with netbook is not really good experience: screen area is just too small for having all components on screen same time and you cannot help noticing that modern IDEs do need way too much resources to be smooth on such tiny machine. Netbooks cannot really be used like normal laptops: usually there is no other option than programs fullscreen, which in practise means you need virtual desktops. This effectively throws windows to the bin, but if that is not problem for you.. go ahead and get one. Just make sure you test it beforehand, many netbooks still have horrible keyboards!<p>Lately I have been doing most of my developing on netbook using vim and must say I love it. There is no performance problems with any scripting languages, not even while having mysql + rails/cakephp on. Only problem is compiling bigger projects when doing c/c++, but that isn't problem if you have access to box with more power like you suggested.<p>My own machine is Samsung n140, although my config is not the most usual one: stripped down arch + xmonad. Battery life while using wlan is from 10 to 14 hours. The reason why I ended to this particular machine is combination of awesome battery life + really nice keyboard, one of the best I have found from any laptop. Minus side is kinda low quality HDD which blew up quite fast, but I use this machine only on battery power with agressive spindowning and load count jumps into sky fast which can explain.",1288252683

1842116,comment,1840444,1840843,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I have used Pylons extensively, but not Django. I really prefer Pylons's packaging and methodology. Django seems more like a ""classical"" web framework where everything is included and much has been reinvented. Since my exploration in programming is often a matter of personal taste (i.e., not forced by employer to learn something very often), I have not really spent much time with Django as that style of framework does not mesh with my preferences.<p>That said, I have recently been tinkering with a Satchmo cart. I am under the impression that Django apps that utilize the Django backends can be converted into plugins for other Django apps with trivial or near-trivial effort, and that gives Django-based applications a lot of power, because if both Satchmo and some Django-based forum use the Django admin and user database, I can plug in or replace forums really easily without creating a bunch of extra overhead for my users. That is very appealing to me, and the first reasonable use of a ""big"" framework (like Django, Rails, or Cake) as far as I am concerned. It has encouraged me to explore Django/Pinax more thoroughly.",1288252558

It was the first time average people could just write public documents to express themselves.<p>Naturally the pages were terrible, covered in things that look good the first time you see it, pointless opinions and personal shrines to obscure relics of pop-culture.<p>The web is still the same, but more everyday. Companies work day and night to have a web presence, and ""using the internet"" is synonymous with replying to status and 'liking' things.<p>Geocities, AOL Homepages, and tripod are landmarks of the first time in history someone could just make a page about themselves, or something they liked and _anyone_ could see it. It was society making paintings on caves.<p>Unfortunately, these sites don't produce revenue, and never will, so from a corporate point of view, they are worthless.<p>The early era of the web is like trying to find rare music. Of course there is a modern site, a torrent, or some convenient way to find most of what you want. What you find is at best, the same thing everyone else finds. The old web is full of non-technical people earnestly trying to make something, not a startup, not to sell a book, just trying to put something together which is largely lost in the ease of ""List your favorite bands""<p>Not that it was better, or more insightful, simply that it is a huge body of primitive work that is unlikely to be recreated. These things should be stored, if for no other reason than we can see the bloviated opinions of mensans, the C-style poetry of 90's sysadmins, or just the insane ramblings of people who think like Gene Ray, but don't have the perseverence to keep up timecube.<p>The sites are a labor of love, no matter the revenue, and it annoys me to no end that AOL or Yahoo has the power to simply delete these old sites because they don't make business sense, to businesses that don't even know what they are doing.<p>Anyway, as someone who mirrored a few old HomePages and Geocities sites, and backs up pieces of the old internet whenever I can find them, this is a breath of fresh air.",1288252147

Chrome's a tad faster, but not significantly so, while FF is actually <i>more</i> stable with tons of windows open (~45+).  Flash crashes about equally in both (and worse in Opera 10), although not so frequently as to be unusable.<p>FF is actually so good I switched from Chrome/Chromium to FF a few months ago (mainly for Vimperator though, but the performance differences were marginal enough not to matter).  I can't help but wonder if 64bit Linux is FF's optimal platform, with its performance dropping off on Windows and maybe Mac?  What OS are you guys running it on?",1288250363

1842032,comment,1841692,1841692,0,0,dasil003,,,"First, I commend your self awareness.  That right there is the biggest battle for me honestly.  You should pay attention to your mind and body, and make sure you are letting yourself recharge.  I'm reminded of a recent article on here about how Germans have the same productivity as Americans with fewer weekly hours and a lot more vacation.  The American culture values putting in the hours more than it does productivity, and it's dreadfully easy to fall into the trap.<p>As to the answer to your question, I think it varies a great deal, but I don't think you'll ever get an honest answer based on any kind of data from silicon valley, statistical or otherwise.  The problem is that productivity is too amorphous, and there's really no hope of getting an honest appraisal from actual engineers because they're just as likely to fooling themselves as to provide factual data.  I know I've had some amazing 100 hour weeks where mountains were moved, but it's really hard to be sure that I wouldn't have gotten twice as much done in two 30 hour weeks...<p>Also apropos, I've currently been on a death march for the past three months.  At this point I'm still pulling 80 hour weeks, but I'm so worn down now that I'm sure I'm not getting anything more done than I would in a normal 40-hour week.  It's sort of a make or break moment for the company I've spent the last 3 years building, so it's worth it this time, but it's also the sort of experience that highlights the dangers of too much work.  My body mind and body are down far beyond what I could achieve on a personal project, or some artificial scenario like you are given in college. It's definitely not a lifestyle that I plan to continue, and I would caution anyone against living this way.  It's better not to burn yourself out, and always keep something in reserve for when you really need it.",1288249509

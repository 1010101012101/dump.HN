And I remembered my colleagues used to spend a great deal of time and efforts subdividing their disciplines and making sure that everyone inside and outside academia classifying them exactly as they wished to be classified. This was a puzzle to me until I read the following quote from Henry Kissinger (after he had left the government but was turned down by Columbia University), ""The reason why there are so much politics in academia is because the stake is so low."" I believe the stake is very high in entrepreneurship and I think no one benefits from spending too much time worrying about what we should be called. However, I think the article is a very good one, in the sense that there is indeed a whole lot of work in being a ""successful"" entrepreneur. Good luck everyone.",1285963142

1748409,story,,,10,9,adidum,"Ask HN: Help me come back and choose the right technologies",,"I am attempting a come back as a programmer, after an unbelievable absence of 3 years. I need your help to refocus, and select the right technologies for what I'm going to need in the near future.
Here is my story: Java developer for about 10 years, up to exactly 3 years ago when I quit because of some major family issues that required my full time attention all this time. But there was something else, that is important for me to always keep in perspective: I was really burnt down and I also became unhappy because my profession took so much time from me, actually all of it, for constantly having to learn something new and being good at what I was doing. I actually love learning, but I my profession didn't leave time for learning anything else besides computers, and life is so much more than computers. I guess I'm a generalist more than a specialist. So this is the first half of my question, how can I be a hacker but in the same time have a real life outside computers. How do you balance both?<p>Having said that, I am ready to start again and I thought I'd start fresh, since my Java is probably already a bit rusty. 
I've been looking these days at things like Ruby, Python and a few LISP flavours. I am attracted to LISP because of the paradigm change it requires, and I'm not really new to it, I used it a bit in the university. 
The reason I want to come back is because I do love technology, always did, and I already have a project lined up, for which I'm looking to select a set of technologies that will make productive ASAP. This project is a directory of local activities for people. The closest model I can think of is Craigslist, with the major difference that all the listings have a temporal dimension, they start and end at some time, and that people can rate and comment on those listings. As an example of such activity, let's say a chess class, that starts in 2 weeks and goes for 3 months, 2 days a week. The project is about aggregating such activities, broken down on categories and geographical areas. How would you do such project, most efficiently?
This project is important for me to get it done successfully and on a timely fashion, I don't have time for too much trial and error, to spend much time learning something that turns out not a good choice. That's why I decided to ask you guys.
I would like to choose something that doesn't have a steep learning curve, so I can became proficient with it sooner than later, something with great support for web applications, tried and stable. 
Should I stick with Java, since it's the only language I am now familiar with it, and it has so many mature web frameworks? Or is this a good time for me to take the leap towards something like LISP?
I must admit the idea of a paradigm shift associated with my comeback sounds very appealing to me. I've already started replacing relational databases when it comes to the data model with something more semantic, like TopicMaps and/or RDF.
In the same time I want to be realistic and maximize my chances of a successful comeback and project completion.
Sorry for the long post, thanks a lot for your kindness.",1285963122

1748395,comment,1748349,1748349,0,0,ghshephard,,,"So, the following comment was made: ""Part of the reason for Friday's split, said Facebook spokesman Jonny Thaw, was to help reduce the price of Facebook's shares, which have risen significantly in recent years.""<p>Now, a reasonable argument can be made that once shares start to be worth more than $10,000 - and certainly in the case of outliers like BRK-A (currently at $124,015/share), there is an argument for a split (or, in the case of BRK, a tracking stock - BRK-B) - simply to prevent the creation of pools that allow people who don't want to buy $10,000 in a single stock to participate. (I think that's why Warren had BRK-B created)<p>But, facebook is trading in the secondary markets (sharespost) at $72. Even assuming they double in value, that would suggest a price that anyone who wanted to purchase, could do so.<p>So, clearly, there is another reason as to why this stock is being split - and I don't put much merit in the ""When a stock is split, it shows an increase in value"" - I have far too much faith in the efficient market to put much belief in that nonsense.<p>My theory, is that there are other, secondary benefits from splitting a stock. My two guesses are:<p>o Bankers get to book a bunch of revenue from splitting the stock and the paperwork that goes with it, so they sell mgmt on the idea.<p>o Some legal advantage to splitting shares, and possibly doing an inventory of all the stock certificates outstanding, getting an audit of the shareholders, etc...<p>Is there anybody that has been on the decision making team for a stock split that would like to weigh in on this one?",1285962975

My problems with it were as follows.<p>1) Amazon doesn't expect one user to buy your service more than one time.  Frankly, I didn't expect it either when I started the service or I would have structured it differently. I ended up having to give people free 2nd accounts when they asked for them, since I had no way to bill them for a 2nd account.  User would sign up for my service (twitter related), like it, and decide they wanted their other twitter account to also use my service.  So they would come back to my site, sign up again with their other twitter user name, I'd send them to Amazon to pay, and they'd get an error, since they had ""already purchased that item"".<p>2) Ending the service.  When I decided to end the service, I went to try to cancel my devpay billing, so they would just stop billing all my users.  This was an email procedure, not a form, which was weird.  The email response I got was unsatisfactory to me.<p><pre><code>     Per your request, we have denied your product. New customers will not be able

The algorithmic part comes from how the computer places the orders. The algorithms are used to benchmark the order placement against some known value, for example two common algorithms are Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP). The sell side wants to get the order into the market and by using algorithms they want to reduce the impact that order has on the price. By doing this, they can fill the client order at a better average price than if they just simply placed a large market order to buy or sell.<p>Algorithmic trading, as described above, is not high-frequency trading. They are not remotely similar. Just because computers are used to manage the order flow into or out of the market does not mean they are related.<p>It is important to note that the conclusions here are very close to what the gut reaction of the market was the day of and after the event. A fat fingered order. This is the algorithmic execution equivalent of a fat fingered order. The order, which was huge, hit the market too quickly and didn't manage its impact. Whether there should be rules to stop this from happening again who knows, but the theories around computers fighting it out and high-frequency firms manipulating the market have been clearly deemed false.",1285962254

SSi is so cool that when we won a government contract to do ""time-shifted file transfers"", we decided that we /could/ meet our contractual obligations with a few weeks of work/testing, but instead we're building a wicked webapp that brings the functionality to everyone on our network, not just big clients with IT departments.<p>Yellowknife's not as cold as you think, and the 24-hours-of-daylight summers are not to be missed.<p>If you're interested and game, we'll make an offer really easy to accept: We'll get and pay for your apartment, a car if you need it, and pay you atop that.

(I think that's why Warren had BRK-B created)<p>But, facebook is trading in the secondary markets (sharespost) at $72.  Even assuming they double in value, that would suggest a price that anyone who wanted to purchase, could do so.<p>So, clearly, there is another reason as to why this stock is being split - and I don't put much merit in the ""When a stock is split, it shows an increase in value"" - I have far too much faith in the efficient market to put much belief in that nonsense.<p>My theory, is that there are other, secondary benefits from splitting a stock.  My two guesses are:<p>o Bankers get to book a bunch of revenue from splitting the stock and the paperwork that goes with it, so they sell mgmt on the idea.<p>o Some legal advantage to splitting shares, and possibly doing an inventory of all the stock certificates outstanding, getting an audit of the shareholders, etc...<p>Is there anybody that has been on the decision making team for a stock split that would like to weigh in on this one?",1285961517

Sure, you may scale up to 4 dynos to handle a techcrunch mention (or something like that), at $0.20 an hour.  But you don't have to keep using that many dynos after the initial traffic spike.  So you just scale them back after 2-6 hours and you pay an extra $1-2 a month for those spikes.<p>Now, if you make it big and have to employ 25 dynos 24/7 then you are getting into the territory of needing your own infrastructure.  But that is probably a long ways off and you'll be hiring people who know that stuff by then.<p>Google around for some performance comparisons of heroku, but I think that I saw a something where you could handle 5000 or so concurrent users with acceptable response times (i.e. not hitting the backlog too deep errors from heroku), with just 2 dynos.  Don't quote me on that, but it's what I remember.<p>If you go to heroku's pricing page you can play with the number of dynos and workers all you want to see possible costs.<p>One other thing to remember is that if you have periods with no traffic (say overnight at launch), then you can scale down to 1 dyno and your app will still be available but it won't cost you a thing.  So really that $87 is the highest possible for a 2 dyno/1 worker deploy.  You could save a lot of money by scaling back to the free 1 dyno during periods of inactivity.",1285960243

I say you spend 30 bucks and try the cheapest option. Never tried linode/heroku though.<p>I found performance of thin in multithreading mode (with appropriate rails settings) quite promising and having low memory footprint. No need to load balance on a single instance since it handles everything cluster would (NB: 1.9+ ruby only). As far as I understand, the best way to load-balance is to give one task per server at a time and keep other tasks in waiting queue.<p>Linux distribution are a matter of taste imho. I always go with ubuntu since it's easier to set up.",1285959816
1748166,comment,1748110,1748110,0,0,tptacek,,,"Ohm kind of bugs me. Redis is very different from other databases. I don't think it's a good idea to hide the raw Redis API from your application, for a couple reasons:<p>* It's important to understand the keys your application is using (and my experience with Ohm was that, in particular with indexing, we wound up with an explosion of keys).<p>* The raw Redis API offers lots of opportunities to restructure your application; two good examples are set operations and blocking operations.<p>Redis is quirky in the best possible way. You should get very familiar with it before you opt to abstract it away.",1285959805

Many choose 1+3 or 2+3, but advanced types let you choose 1+2 which in many cases is remarkable and somewhat surprising that it is even possible.<p>I don't think it's really that surprising that it's possible. Most programs don't rely on any deep mathematical properties for their correctness, so the ability to formalize a proof that they are correct and encoding it into a type system doesn't surprise me at all. If it is possible to do it on a large program without maintenance or scalability problems, then I will be more impressed.<p>You also present a false trichotomy. Haskell is not actually a completely 'safe' language; it still has exceptions that can cause a program to ""go wrong"" and terminate unexpectedly. You can write 'fast' code with it, but it isn't as fast as what I could write in a lower-level language.<p>> Nothing about this type hackery is specific to singly linked lists, and advanced type hackary is applicable for pretty much any data structure. Also note that the singly linked lists used in zip may not actually be represented by pointer-chasing singly-linked lists. They may be ""fused"" together into efficient loops that process the input directly.<p>As the data structures get further away from algebraic data types, the type hackery gets more and more involved. If you start working with arbitrary mutable data structures that arise in practice, the type hackery becomes a topic for a PhD thesis rather than something usable in practical programming today.<p>I don't know of any compiler that actually does a reasonable job converting uses of data structures like lists and association lists into arrays and hash tables in general. There are compilers (like GHC) that handle special cases but fall over beyond that. I think this falls into the territory of the ""sufficiently smart compiler"" fallacy. Also, making data contiguous is just the simplest of a common set of data representation optimizations. Does any compiler automatically convert a list into an intrusive doubly linked list or eliminate the use of a visited stack for DFS by stealing a bit from vertices or reversing pointers?",1305422298

The article states that subjects were to maintain their sleep schedule for two weeks. I reckon that any sudden shift in sleep schedules would have a good chance of causing fatigue. A more interesting experiment would be to see how those with alternative sleep schedules that have practiced them in the long term compare to those with 8 a day schedules.",1305422282

2549023,comment,2548665,2548665,9,0,udoprog,,,"Loved this article. I would love to see a simliar test around polyphasic sleep (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep</a>).<p>I've actually tried the Uberman sleep schedule for three weeks. This is where you sleep 20 minutes for each 4 hours, totalling in a whopping 2 hours sleep each day.<p>The time gain was insane, and the transition period aswell (between day 3-5 I actually hallucinated due to sleep deprevation). But around 1.5 weeks something strange happened. The 20 minute period that you are allowed to sleep seemed like hours each time, and I would wake up like clockwork on the 20 minute mark.<p>The whole routine is not just a sleep routine, it affects your entire lifestyle. No stimulants, including sugar, high degrees of fat, caffeine. No sedatives, alcohol, drugs (!). And the fact that you are awake during the night when the whole world seems dead is one of the hardest social aspects to handle. What do you do with 6 extra hours each day?<p>Of course there's the aspect of finding somewhere to sleep every 4 hours (was at school at the time), and if you ever missed out, you would have hell to pay.<p>I eventually buckled on a skiing trip with an open bar, had a nice weekend and decided to going back to normal sleeping patterns. Partly because it was not socially acceptable to sleep 2 hours a day (my father threatened to beat some sense into me). But also that there was very little foundation that this kind of sleep pattern was even safe. A couple of million years of evolution had other idea's of when and how long it is necessary to sleep.<p>Other than that, the foundations that I gathered up from this was that when changing your sleeping pattern. The body frantically tries to adapt. By sleeping extremely short periods the body would effectively increase the amount of REM sleep (and yes, I dreamed a lot during these sleeping periods), however, it has not been proven that you don't need the other types of sleep.<p>This is probably a lot of rumours, and a lot of wishful thinking. I personally wish there was some solid backing behind this kind of reasoning (more time awake is awesome!), There are a lot of buzz out there (check google and youtube), but I've been unable to find anything reasonably solid.",1305421643

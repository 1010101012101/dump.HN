Forget all the automotive deaths attributed to people coming around blind corners too close to the middle of the road. Forget drivers in the rain or fog who can't tell where the road ends and the ditch begins. ""It spoils the character"" of the roadway, and that's more important than safety.<p>Idiots!",1253239049

This implementation is 68 lines long:  twice the Clojure, but still less than the Scala.  A big portion of this difference is because the Clojure version cheats, modeling the system as straight-up producer/consumer with queue size constraints.  The other two implementations spend about 20 lines dealing with Customer actors, which the Clojure completely punts.  The Clojure still wins, but it's not as big a margin as it looks.",1253238921

829415,comment,828613,829178,0,0,chipsy,,,"With respect to game entities, the industry flirted with inheritance hierarchies when they started using C++ in the mid-90s, but in this decade it's mostly shifted to a compositional approach where an entity is just a structure that ties together different components.<p>In my latest game project I made two major decisions about entities that really helped later:<p>-Representing entities as property lists + a unique id.<p>-Generating some of the entity logic based on state transition systems I make and export from QFSM.<p>The first part means that I can start with JSON as my map format and reuse them at runtime without a difficult ""parse"" step, by having the spawn code just dump more fields on top of the original object. There's some clunkiness in that I end up with a lot of potential for name collision, but so far it hasn't become something dangerously complex.<p>The second part is something I'm pretty proud of, as it came from the realization that the major problem with entity state is not the states themselves, but the transitions between states; those have to be kept well-formalized or you lose track very quickly. Implementation as an FSM is not exactly correct because an FSM navigates its way through the entire graph on every pass, while an entity fits better with a continuation-style approach, where on each frame it starts with a transition to use, does processing within that transition and logic to choose the next one, and then releases execution until the next frame. If I ever want to do multiple transitions in a single frame that's possible simply by calling transition() recursively.<p>Generating the code to choose a transition means that I barely have to think about that part: I draw up the graph, export it, and then add some lexical macros to my code to wire it up. I decided to use this system for the main loop as well as entities as it gave me more guarantees about how the code path progresses, the timing of different events, initialization/cleanup, etc., and the results were really good - the code factored itself quite naturally and I'm experiencing an absence of many types of bugs that normally haunted me in the past.<p>The next thing I want to try, which I'm not doing for this game, is to generate code for managing components as well; I have a lot of boilerplate for registering and unregistering the components at spawn/despawn right now, and the components aren't formalized very well; they tend to manipulate fields on the entity somewhat abusively. If I can clean that up, it'll probably be even easier to work with.",1253237225

Each department from the DMV equivalent to the one that provides subsidized food to the poor to the passport office require different forms of identification. Since corruption is frequent and bureaucratic bullshit as rampant as anywhere else, this makes getting anything that requires govt. involvement very difficult and expensive for poor people. The hope is that these IDs will replace all forms of identification and store information that will let all these departments use the same card.<p>By the way identity theft is a huge problem too but not in the way that you think. The government subsidizes a lot of stuff for poor people (sugar, kerosene, cooking gas) and naturally there is a per person quota. Crooks use identity theft to claim this stuff on behalf of poor folks and sell it at higher prices in the market. Although the problem has become significantly less serious since India liberalized its economy (due to various reasons), it is still a significant problem.",1253236448

I mean, someone out there probably has an idea for advertising that can actually give more value back to the advertisers.

When companies were in charge of this job you could control them with things like copyright laws. Now you can't.<p>2. Advertising is being turned upside down. A lot of advertising is/was probably really over inflated anyway, companies paying a lot for ads that don't do much for them. The move online exposed publishers to more competition & easier scrutiny. The online move may have made ads less valuable too. It's complicated and opaque. Advertising always has been that way. When a business model is built on advertising, you have two points of failure: People stop reading, advertisers stop advertising. Either one kills the whole thing.<p>Since these two things happening at the same time but aren't really related, a lot of people are going to understand things wrong. Lately a lot of journalists that are normally smart when covering politics or wars are covering 'The Fate of Publishing.' They are misreading a lot of things. Their interest was sparked when cheques started bouncing and their articles are an insight into the kind of mistakes smart people with a vested interest are going to make.",1253235679

From the world's largest agency (3 years at JWT), I spent 10 years at a mid-sized outfit, and then I finally put my name on the door when I was in my mid-thirties. What may make this different than programming, is that in agencies we all tend to be given as much room to create as possible (the exception being at JWT).  However, to live is to create.  Humans are in their soul creative, as that is part of the life force, the source.  Let that atrophy and you become a waking/walking part of a whole.  I love both your analogy to animals and food.

As people grow through life we develop through psychological states that oscillate between 'we' centred and 'I' centred. There are four main values systems that a programmer is likely to be inhabiting.  In the first(DQ) a boss is essential.  The second(ER) will work very well as their own boss. The third(FS) craves peer support - but not a boss. The fourth(GT) can work in either way - as long as they don't get board because they are out of there if they do.<p>(in reality people are complicated and can be inhabiting multiple values systems - but most have a dominant one.)",1206100194

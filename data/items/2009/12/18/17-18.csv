OO has been sold as a tool to reduce complexity, but can become a major source of it as projects develop.<p>Also, reading code with several levels of inheritance (more than three, perhaps) means dealing with several levels of spaghetti code - the code becomes a mess of ""this does that, but no, wait, it doesn't anymore here, though here it does that except it does this first.""",1261159134

1003539,comment,1003121,1003121,0,0,strlen,,,"The criticism of Java language is very much to the point (re: verbosity, inheritance). There's some confusion where he calls anonymous classes implementing interfaces ""abstract classes with virtual methods""; that's not to say that it's not an awkward approach to closures and function pointers. There's also criticism of synchronized and the Thread class, but there's no mention of the strong points (Doug Lea's java.util.concurrent).<p>However, the criticism of JVM seems like it's written in 1999 about the Blackdown JVM (Josh Bloch in his interview in Coders At Work attributes much distrust of Java earlier on at Google to experience with this platform). Hot-spot can, many times, be within 10-15% of C's performance. In many cases code running on the JVM will outperform C++'s runtime (and particularly boost).<p>That's not to say there aren't issues: garbage collection pauses, the stack based nature -- rightly -- is pointed out as an impediment, but it's odd that LLVM isn't mention. However, excluding JVM due to performance (especially when used with modern languages, e.g. Scala, Clojure, Ruby, Javascript) seems short-sighted. See Cliff Click's post on JVM performance:<p><a href=""http://blogs.azulsystems.com/cliff/2009/09/java-vs-c-performance-again.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.azulsystems.com/cliff/2009/09/java-vs-c-perform...</a><p>Repeat after me: HotSpot is not Blackdown, 1.5+ is not 1.2 (you have non-blocking I/O -- even though NIO is still painful to use, you have autoboxing, you have foreach, you have -- for all their limitations -- generics, you have annotations), you can run more than Java on the JVM. Even if you do choose Java (which has many flaws, not the least of them being a marketing-driven language, aimed at enterprise C++ developers, rather than a language made by hackers for themselves), you don't have to use Spring and J2EE. In most cases performance is a MacGuffin when it comes to Java and JVM.",1261158447

I just helped submit an NSF proposal and would welcome such guidelines on our research. We already follow them for the most part, and it would help us ensure that conferences and publishers won’t object to the dissemination of the results of our research if it’s not just our own desire, but an obligation from our funding agency.<p>I would also appreciate if you look into the feasibility of establishing open data and open source requirements for the CISE division of NSF where funded projects would be obligated provide data generated as part of the research (this isn’t always reasonable, so some care will be necessary in formulating this policy) as well as source code used. Right now, especially in computer science, it’s extremely difficult to replicate the results of experiments and often we find that researchers have to invest time in reverse engineering someone’s experiment simply to be able to compare the results one research got with the results of another or their own work. In addition, university technology transfer departments sometimes get in the way of researchers who try and open up their work. Making this a firm requirement from the funding agency provides the researchers with the credibility and leverage they need to ensure technology transfer departments stop interfering with dissemination efforts.<p>It’s rare someone ever asks for a requirement, but in this case I think extending these types of requirements to NSF programs will give us the power and leverage we need to overcome the obstacles in the way of disseminating our work in the fashion we’d like to be doing anyways.",1261156704

I got a letter from my credit card company saying there was going to be a 20% interest rate hike on my card. It's pretty embarassing to admit I have a credit card with a sizable balance on it, but I'd like to point out that my company gave an easy way out:<p>I was allowed to ""opt-out"" of my card to avoid having the interest rate hike affect my existing balance. This means my account is not closed, but I am not allowed to use the card anymore and my balance is still charged the pre-existing interest rate. I have no need to use this card, it is mainly a towering specter of shameful debt to be paid down, so this option was a dream come true.",1261155771

Another example of this is web browsers, which cache DNS beyond the TTL in order to provide a slightly faster experience. In the process, they break GSLB, which can no longer operate optimally since it can't rely on users re-querying DNS after the TTL of their answer expires.<p>Most folks are quite happy with your default experience, but that's because they're ignorant of the ramifications.",1261155751

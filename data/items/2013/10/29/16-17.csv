6635678,comment,6634219,6634219,2,0,akg_67,,,"Just a week ago I returned to US after three week visit to India and Japan.<p>Based on my recent experiences, I will say bribery problem in India is due to:<p>1. Lack of sense of community  in &#x27;givers&#x27;. For example, when a group of people are waiting for something, they don&#x27;t feel sense of community of &#x27;waiting together&#x27;. Everybody is looking a way to be not part of that community enabling &#x27;takers&#x27; to solicit bribery so that someone doesn&#x27;t need to wait with others.<p>2. Too many laws and bureaucracy that enable more points of solicitation by &#x27;takers&#x27;. For example, while traveling on a tourist bus, the bus was stopped by a cop. The cop solicited bribe from driver because the first-aid kit had a partially used tube of ointment and some passengers were hanging newspapers and shawls on windows to block out sunlight. There is no reason to create laws for every little thing giving more opportunities for &#x27;takers&#x27;.<p>But there were some positive signs. It appears younger generation is becoming less tolerant for bribery and corruption. It was nice to see that some young people on the bus were trying to take picture of &#x27;corrupt&#x27; cop using mobile phones to post online. Of course, these young people and driver were scolded by older people on the bus (lack of sense of community) for delaying the bus as cop took driver far away from bus to avoid being photographed.",1383065987

It might be they allow it, in which case it&#x27;s fine. More typical is that you need to get some level of approval for work that doesn&#x27;t conflict.  In some cases they ban it outright, though I suspect the latter isn&#x27;t particularly enforceable.<p>Certainly I&#x27;ve been in situations where I&#x27;ve picked up non-conflicting side contracts, and my employer has turned the other cheek because the approval process was tedious.

6635583,comment,6633869,6634358,8,0,kens,,,"Let me try to summarize the paper, which I only slightly understand. They take a 2-D grid with a magnetic domain at each point, sort of like a hard drive. It starts out with random N/S orientations. Each domain &quot;wants&quot; to match up with its neighbors. As domains flip, they will start to match up more and more. Eventually you have a phase transition where you suddenly go from mostly-random to mostly-aligned, kind of like water freezing. This is a standard physics model called an Ising model.<p>They look at the &quot;information flow&quot; between neighboring domains. This is sort of how much influence a domain has on its neighbors, with an incomprehensible transfer entropy measure. At the beginning, when everything is random, there&#x27;s not much correlation. At the end, when everything is aligned, there&#x27;s no information flow since neighbors are already aligned. The peak influence is right in the middle when domains are snapping into alignment with each other. The paper measures this information flow via simulations of the grid and finds the peak information flow is in the disordered phase shortly before the phase transition to order. This seems like a reasonable conclusion.<p>They then conjecture that this information flow peak isn&#x27;t just for the specific Ising model they investigate but may happen in general for financial crises, epileptic seizures, and other complex models, so if you can measure information flow you can tell when the phase transition will happen. I don&#x27;t see anything in the paper that actually supports the conjecture, but it makes for nice headlines. (I don&#x27;t want to get into credentialism, but it makes me a bit suspicious that the authors aren&#x27;t statistical physicists (who usually do Ising model stuff), but work in a center for consciousness science, civil engineering, and other random departments.)<p>Apologies to anyone who actually understands Ising models, because I&#x27;ve probably totally mangled the explanation, but I figured since nobody else had posted a summary it might be useful.",1383065277

This could just be your opinion/feeling which is fine, or it could be you stating that your opinion is the only correct one and <i>everyone</i> finds it tedious (or should). In the same way a little extra wordage can avoid me looking to be full of shit, a little extra in the sentence fragment would reduce the chance of you coming off as someone who is overly self-important and assumes his thoughts are universal facts. Maybe worrying about how I sound in this way is a neurotic issue...<p><i>> How reliable is your source?</i><p>So to avoid problems with the reliability of my source, I should just not let anyone know what the source is?

I don;t see how pointing the that one study is <i>worse</i> than just stating the fact/opinion. With the link the reader can nip off and see if it looks like what they would consider an acceptable source.  With just that one link and no others a semi-educated reader can make a judgement as to whether my opinion is well enough informed to be trusted in any way. Heck, on a good forum if you were to post a fact/opinion based on a single source (and state the source) helpful people might suggest other sources you&#x27;d like to review, and this extra information could be useful to other readers too. Of course such discussions can get a bit flamey, but that is a human failing for another discussion!<p><i>> If I say &quot;the barn is red&quot;, do you want spectroscopy results?</i><p>Not quite. You also need to provide the results of a scan of the back of your eye, we need to know what signals your brain gets from the eye in response to the wavelengths we consider to represent red - your optical nerve might be wired up wrong. Of course these things can be taken too far, but I don&#x27;t consider making it clear that something is opinion (or believed to be a fact but one based on limited research) rather than something I consider an absolute incontrovertible truth not to be too far.<p>Yes, the reader needs to take some responsibility for not jumping to conclusions based on the exact words we write, but the writer either needs to make a little effort to not be misunderstood or accept that some will completely misjudge where they are coming from (and of those two options I generally choose the first, you presumably prefer the latter approach).",1383065145

The expected yield on a lottery ticket is somewhere in the magnitude of 50-70%, meaning: if you buy a lot of tickets, you will probably get a net yield of something between those numbers. However, the large amounts of tickets you have to buy / check / redeem do not make this a viable laundering strategy. You&#x27;ll leave traces if you do this at scale, for example if you bought the owner of a local bodega to get you tickets &#x27;wholesale&#x27;, like boxes at a time; then the lotteries will easily spot patterns of sellers doing unusual transactions.<p>What I think you are referring to, is the (alleged) practice of criminals paying above-market prices (in cash) for casino chips or lottery tickets. Let&#x27;s say you win $100. For a criminal, if he pays you $110 for that ticket, he has a laundering cost of only 9%, because he can redeem that ticket as 100$ in clean money. 9% is quite cheap; it&#x27;s not uncommon to account for 30, 40% in costs when laundering money. And since lotteries and casinos are about big amounts, you only need one such transaction to launder sizable amounts. As the original winner, you end up with more than you won, but you can spend it only on holidays, restaurants and other cash-friendly activities.<p>(all examples are ignoring taxes etc, for which you&#x27;d have to correct to make the numbers work in reality)",1383064935

IMHO OOP has not proven itself out to reduce confustion, or simplify code bases.  It tends to make distributed systems which are increasingly necessary for large projects more complicated.  In JS I tend to have two types of objects.  The first being data, that which can be easily serialized, transported, stored and deserialized.   The second being libraries meant to act against requests or use of said data.  The second can be extended to those which tie a user interface to said data as well.<p>When you break things down in such a way it&#x27;s easier to develop systems that can scale out, and are easier to maintain as such.  You can do similar things in most OO environments.  I also tend to think that my Duck data class should probably <i>NOT</i> have a quack method.  My DuckHandler class should.<p>OO has brought us a lot of extremely bloated, over-engineered, &quot;enterprise&quot; monstrosities over the years, and imho should not be encouraged.<p>JS is very much my favorite language, and in some scenarios (testing, and build scripts) I have started to use CoffeeScript.  My second is actually C#, which I pick over Java because JNI is such a pain by comparison.  It really depends on what you need.<p>Sometimes you just need to get something done.  You will not be able to use Ruby or C++ in client-side browser code any time soon.

6635428,comment,6634648,6635102,4,0,mikeyouse,,,"<p><pre><code>    Nurses unionize to drive up their own wages.\n</code></pre>\nAh that old canard. Fewer than 20% of RNs are in unions. Those in unions do make more than their non-union counterparts (~$200 more per week [1]), but if you think that&#x27;s why nurses tend to unionize, you&#x27;re fairly far from the mark. Especially since real nurses wages haven&#x27;t increased in the past 10 years.[2]<p>Imagine that being a programmer required a license from the state in order to practice.  Now imagine that if you make a significant error, you lose that license, pretty much ensuring you could never make another dollar in salary as a programmer. Say your work consists of doing week-long projects, with a team of 4 other programmers. Your code must be released weekly and must be bug-free. Now what happens when your boss realizes he could save 40% on costs if he cuts your team from 5 to 3? Or to 2?  How likely are you to release bug-free code?  That&#x27;s the situation for nurses.<p>Adding to that, nursing is one of the most dangerous jobs in the country based on the number of on-the-job injuries and missed-work.[3] Most of these injuries are caused since hospital staffs are being cut, which leads to nurses having to lift, turn, and dress patients without additional help.<p>Furthermore, nursing care levels are directly correlated with improved patient outcomes, shorter hospital stays, lower mortality, and a number of other positive indicators. [4]<p>So you have hospital management on one side, who&#x27;s incentives are to cut pay, cut hours, and cut staff (and frankly, to keep patients longer). And then you have nurses / techs / etc. on the other side, who are more likely to injure themselves, more likely to lose their licenses, and more likely to provide substandard care with those cuts. Do you honestly think unionizing is a bad idea?<p>[1] Barry Hirsch and David Macpherson, “Union Membership and Earnings Data Book,” The Bureau of National \nAffairs.

Certainly we can make improvements, certainly we can do better.<p>The fact that the human brain is limited to fitting through the birth canal is a great example.

What you&#x27;re recording isn&#x27;t as useful as you think.<p>The problem population today is elderly patients with chronic conditions, either landing them in the hospital constantly or requiring regular visits to specialists, labs and pharmacies.  This population does not use smart phones.  So the burden is on the physicians and hospitals to track the information and coordinate care.<p>The whole idea of Accountable Care Organizations (What you described as &quot;The New Model&quot;) is to coordinate care.  ACOs are pilot projects, most just barely starting up.  So the reality is only a fraction of the population in the US will be affected by these organizations.  The big workflow change is really for the nurses who gather the information, not the physicians.  The goal of ACOs is to improve outcomes.  ACOs receive bonuses if the can improve outcomes for the same cost or less that is being paid for the same population today.<p>Also as a FYI, everything you described as Obamacare (ACOs / EHRs) was actually developed and funded in 2009 by ARRA, not last year in the ACA / Obamacare.",1383062776

Significant corruption will cause a significant backlash from these stakeholders.<p>6) The institutions in the United States are more established, and have spent more time developing the necessary checks, balances, and management norms that keep them free from corruption.<p>7) Cultural norms play an important role.

By contrast, my wife comes from one of the world&#x27;s most corrupt nations, which I have visited.  A few factors I&#x27;ve seen:<p>- Wage disparity.  In corrupt nations government officials are poorly paid.  In a place like Canada, they make a liveable salary, with good job security for unelected (ie. service) workers.<p>- Enforcement of laws - our police force is well-paid, and politicians are subject to the law like any citizen.<p>I think the biggest difference is culture though.  Maybe because of our immigrant roots, there&#x27;s a culture of working for what you have.  Not breaking the rules.  Canadians are hesitant to break even social norms that aren&#x27;t law.  Maybe because of how we&#x27;re brought up, we&#x27;ve learned to respect the &#x27;social contract&#x27;.<p>Even my wife, who grew up with corruption being a part of everyday life (in her country something as simple as getting the police to respond to a crime in progress requires bribery - many communities have gangs that keep the peace in the absence of the police), had quickly adjusted to Canadian life (even when I met her I didn&#x27;t know she was an immigrant), and sees the benefits of following laws, even when they&#x27;re easy to break.<p>And another theory that may have weight - the weather.  Where I live it&#x27;s winter for half the year.  As I write this our city is a cold, snowy wasteland.  Survival means cooperation.  It&#x27;s quite possible that this spirit of cooperation has been instilled in the culture, preventing widespread class-conflict, and cooperation between immigrant cultures that normally wouldn&#x27;t get along in their home countries...",1383062519

Public school teacher has gone from a pretty blah job for 2nd class citizens (just speaking the truth of how they felt about them at the time) to one of the few remaining decent middle class jobs in many areas.  Its not the .gov jobs have gone up in pay or status or quality, its that all the .com jobs have descended deeply.  So a DMV clerk knows darn well that a .com clerk doing the same job can now only hope to earn a hair over minimum wage... That keeps him honest.  He&#x27;s already the highest paid counter-person in the entire county, what exactly are you supposed to offer him to top that?<p>Another example, the old &quot;those who can, do, those who can&#x27;t, teach&quot;  Well a shop instructor in the old days might have made only half what a tool and die worker in the industry would make.  But, the hours are better, working conditions are way better, arguably safer, some just like to teach...  Fast forward from 1970 to 2010 and the shop instructor is still making the same pay, its just that most of the industry has left so frankly the comparative real world pay for the same guy with the same skills in .com world would be whatever gas station attendants get, or most likely whatever SS disability pays.  Good luck bribing him for a better grade.<p>That&#x27;s the problem I see with recent calls to massively drop .gov pay scales to keep them in line with the imploding standard of living in the USA.... You start paying the DMV clerk only as much as the counter lady at the supermarket, which is probably $7.25 part time no benefits no health insurance, in the short term you clean up financially, in the long term that DMV clerk is going to flood the market with fake IDs and such.  I mean, why not?  This job used to pay a living wage, well I&#x27;m going to get a living wage one way or another, unless that clerk is suicidal.<p>Its the same deal with cops.  I had some friends who did the mall rentacop type jobs; literally minimum wage no benefits no health insurance often 1099 psuedo-contractors.  You can bribe a mall cop, or so I&#x27;m told.  The same guy with the same skills and education who makes it onto the force and starts pulling down $75K/yr instead of $7.50/hr is simply un bribe able.<p>You can&#x27;t bribe royalty or the elite, or at least not as well as you can bribe poor people.",1383062464

I don&#x27;t need to defend JavaScript&#x27;s Schemeness or Douglas Crockford.  (I&#x27;m sure Douglas is perfectly capable of doing that by himself.)<p>The obvious authority argument: Given random dude on the internet (heretofore to be known as &quot;Stuff&quot; in reference to his web site), and the guy who wrote jslint and is currently fixing JavaScript, on the topic of what other languages JavaScript is most like, I will defer to Douglas for now.<p>First and foremost in the actual reasons &quot;Stuff&quot; is wrong is this claim:<p>[saying javascript is scheme is] &quot;...a thought-terminating clich. It carries negative informational content and makes people actually know less about languages than they did before.&quot;<p>I am walking talking evidence that &quot;Stuff&quot; is dead wrong on this point.  The idea that JavaScript has the functional language parts that I like in Python and Scheme made me curious about the language, allowed me to drop by preconceptions, and I investigated further and learned more about the language.  That may well be the exact intention of Douglas saying JavaScript is Scheme-y, which it turns out, &quot;Stuff&quot; admits to before he gets started.  This completely undermines the point that &quot;Stuff&quot; was trying to make here, before he makes it.<p>Second, &quot;Stuff&quot; capitulates to 1/3 similarity on the number of core Scheme features.  Except, as he notes, another several are reasonably there but not up to his snuff.  That puts us at more like 1/2 to 2/3.  The other third is crap nobody wants in a modern language.  &quot;Stuff&quot; is being (admittedly) biased about where he draws the line.<p>The most telling is that he points right at the things that we all want in a language: minimalism, first class functions, and closures.  He comes right out and names all the languages we like and hold up as being &quot;better&quot; than JavaScript.  :O  There&#x27;s no better reason to call JavaScript Scheme-y.",1383062427

An ignominious honor, perhaps, but it&#x27;s worth consideration. 60% of doctors know how to use it, since most doctors do some type of rounds through a VA hospital since it&#x27;s the largest medical system in the United States.<p>You&#x27;re right, most EHR UI is bad and it&#x27;s built upon old technology. It entirely pre-dates the &quot;design era&quot;. But, part of the reason for this is that healthcare was one of the first major industries to use IT heavily. What these systems lack in modern design principles, they often make up for in stability and ability to support system flows for larger organizations.<p>I admire your spirit and I hope that you do make an impact on healthcare. But, it might be wise to try and glean some lessons from the past vs. writing everything off as something that &quot;fucking sucks&quot;. You might learn something along the way on your path to making health delivery better.",1383062411
6635102,comment,6634648,6634648,5,0,babesh,,,"Totally wrong. The reason the US healthcare system sucks is that it&#x27;s an oligopoly. Medical schools limit enrollment to limit the supply of doctors thus keeping salaries higher than they otherwise would be. Nurses unionize to drive up their own wages. Insurance companies pile on the paperwork because they can charge you for it. Doctors are incentivized to push more expensive drugs and procedures because they make more money. Drug companies develop drugs that will make them the most money and wine and dine pharmacists and doctors to ply their drugs. Thus those that can pay end up paying more and more. Those that cannot get no coverage at all. Oligopolistic capitalism at its finest. Everyone in the system gets paid off a bit to not rock the boat.",1383062407

From a technology perspective, if you really want to fundamentally change healthcare then you have to tackle diagnosis. For the majority of illness and disease, we still do not have a good set of technologies that diagnose accurately, quickly, and cheaply. Instead a physician makes an educated guess based on symptoms and sometimes on tests. Tests which give clues but rarely a definitive answer.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, but I know that the sooner we take the &quot;art&quot; out of medicine, the sooner healthcare will get a lot better.",1383062401

More than once over the years I have spent 5+ hours doing a coding exercise for a company only to get a one sentence response, telling me that my &quot;code fell short&quot;. If I pressed them further they might say my code was &quot;hard to read&quot; or &quot;not what they were looking for&quot;. Vague, unhelpful, and pitiful responses. 0 interaction. No chance for a rebuttal.<p>Its a very lopsided assessment. Normally an in interview you can judge the company while the company judges you. That way in an hour interview you both can probably tell its not a good fit. If I&#x27;m applying and coding in python and within 15 minutes of a live coding exercise they tell me I shouldn&#x27;t use list comprehensions because they are hard to read, I&#x27;d be out of there faster than I could measure. If I just spent 5 hours coding to get the same response? I&#x27;d get a little upset.<p>When I give critical feedback I will typically go through line by line and tell the candidate what is wrong and what is good. This is done with the candidate, since nobody is 100% correct so my judgement might be wrong and they can correct me.

  No power bricks
  Better airflow
  No screen burning electricity (although this is minimal)

I take the exact same anecdotes and conclude, &quot;Wow, black Americans are pretty resilient.&quot;<p>>Federal troops withdrew from the South in 1877. The dream of Reconstruction died. For the next century, political violence was visited upon blacks wantonly, with special treatment meted out toward black people of ambition. Black schools and churches were burned to the ground. Black voters and the political candidates who attempted to rally them were intimidated, and some were murdered. At the end of World War I, black veterans returning to their homes were assaulted for daring to wear the American uniform. The demobilization of soldiers after the war, which put white and black veterans into competition for scarce jobs, produced the Red Summer of 1919: a succession of racist pogroms against dozens of cities ranging from Longview, Texas, to Chicago to Washington, D.C. Organized white violence against blacks continued into the 1920s—in 1921 a white mob leveled Tulsa’s “Black Wall Street,” and in 1923 another one razed the black town of Rosewood, Florida—and virtually no one was punished.<p>>Having been enslaved for 250 years, black people were not left to their own devices. They were terrorized. In the Deep South, a second slavery ruled. In the North, legislatures, mayors, civic associations, banks, and citizens all colluded to pin black people into ghettos, where they were overcrowded, overcharged, and undereducated. Businesses discriminated against them, awarding them the worst jobs and the worst wages. Police brutalized them in the streets. And the notion that black lives, black bodies, and black wealth were rightful targets remained deeply rooted in the broader society. Now we have half-stepped away from our long centuries of despoilment, promising, “Never again.” But still we are haunted. It is as though we have run up a credit-card bill and, having pledged to charge no more, remain befuddled that the balance does not disappear. The effects of that balance, interest accruing daily, are all around us.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case...</a>",1438201677

9971333,comment,9937235,9947896,0,0,jonotrain,,,"First off, we should acknowledge that your argument has shifted significantly - from an ontological to a practical concern. The ontological question, whether the archive exists or not, is independent from the practical question of whether or not it is useful. Initially you said that no archive could contain more than ~10^80 objects because the number of atoms in the universe placed an upper limit on its contents. Now you say that this website does not contain its books because of the amount of work necessary to retrieve them. Would you consider this to be different if the quantity of texts was less than 10^80? If not, we should recognize that you have shifted from your earlier argument, which was untenable.<p>As for your present argument, i would first point out that you should not treat quantitative differences as essential differences. Any archival system requires some sort of key system for retrieval. Print libraries have the Dewey decimal system, the internet has URLs, and libraryofbabel.info has its book locations, strings of letters and numbers which you are correct to point out are just as information-rich as the texts themselves. But you claim that because of the size of keys, the texts in this digital archive do not exist - this is fallacious. How large must a key-value system get before it ceases to exist? If a poem&#x27;s title is longer than its text does it cease to exist?  Greek philosophers parodied the confusion of quantitative and qualitative thought by asking how many grains of sand we needed to add together before we had a heap. Once again, you have confused a practical and an ontological argument - the length of keys (and quantity of text) may affect the usefulness of libraryofbabel.info, but they cannot affect its existence.<p>You consider three heterogeneous things in your examples - a floating point register and the set of possible floating point numbers, libraryofbabel.info and the texts it contains, the human mind and what it &quot;actually thinks about&quot;. Let us begin with the last - you claim that the human mind only contains what it &quot;actually thinks about.&quot; If this is so, what is a memory? Your failure to grapple with the difficult category of possibility leads to the ontological confusion in your argument.<p>If we limit our consideration to practicality, I would agree that the libraryofbabel.info is not useful in the same way as a digital archive like JSTOR. In other libraries, one can find texts by subject matter, author, period, etc. and learn something new from their contents. libraryofbabel.info exists to show us the same language we have encountered already in a new context. This allows us to reflect on the essence of language, which is not restricted to the intentions of a conscious and rational speaking subject (as you imagine when you speak of what we &quot;actually think about&quot;), but is always open on irrational excess.",1438201628

Could be wrong, but my point is there&#x27;s no way to know.<p>Without knowing that it&#x27;s hard not to look at their conclusions such as young founders do better and repeat founders cost more with a large helping of grains of salt.<p>A young founder is less likely to be a repeat founder. Therefore these founders will cost less, per the conclusion they reached. And if performance is measured as ROI then they will &quot;perform&quot; better even if underlying talent or company growth is constant.<p>So it looks as though there&#x27;s just a lot of observational data without much insight.",1438200698

As late as 1950, the National Association of Real Estate Boards’ code of ethics warned that “a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood … any race or nationality, or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values.” A 1943 brochure specified that such potential undesirables might include madams, bootleggers, gangsters—and “a colored man of means who was giving his children a college education and thought they were entitled to live among whites.”<p>The federal government concurred. It was the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, not a private trade association, that pioneered the practice of redlining, selectively granting loans and insisting that any property it insured be covered by a restrictive covenant—a clause in the deed forbidding the sale of the property to anyone other than whites. Millions of dollars flowed from tax coffers into segregated white neighborhoods.<p>“For perhaps the first time, the federal government embraced the discriminatory attitudes of the marketplace,” the historian Kenneth T. Jackson wrote in his 1985 book, Crabgrass Frontier, a history of suburbanization. “Previously, prejudices were personalized and individualized; FHA exhorted segregation and enshrined it as public policy. Whole areas of cities were declared ineligible for loan guarantees.” Redlining was not officially outlawed until 1968, by the Fair Housing Act. By then the damage was done—and reports of redlining by banks have continued.<p>The federal government is premised on equal fealty from all its citizens, who in return are to receive equal treatment. But as late as the mid-20th century, this bargain was not granted to black people, who repeatedly paid a higher price for citizenship and received less in return. Plunder had been the essential feature of slavery, of the society described by Calhoun. But practically a full century after the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the plunder—quiet, systemic, submerged—continued even amidst the aims and achievements of New Deal liberals.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case...</a>",1438200086

Restaurants become famous for being impossible to get a table at. The chef is more respected by his or her peers and the media. Newspapers write articles about the restaurant. The restaurant&#x27;s cookbook starts selling more copies on Amazon. The chef is invited to an interview on Food Network. None of these things happen if they raise the prices until there&#x27;s no excess demand.<p>Ferrari also has a long-standing policy of manufacturing &quot;one fewer car than the market demands.&quot;",1374807551

One was to explore the argument above with a constructive project -- writing a blog[1].<p>An example I gave for the inner platform effect was the Wordpress file wp-cron.php.<p>It gets called on every request made to Worpdress because WP has no other way to arrange for scheduled tasks to be carried out. So you get a performance hit and your scheduling relies on stochastic sampling. Oh, and it stops working very well when (as inevitably happens) you slather Wordpress with caching.<p>In an OS-up design, you just delegate this to cron.<p>Or plugins. In a standard current design, these can&#x27;t be isolated. In an OS-up design, you can can make them standalone programs with separate accounts that can&#x27;t reach into and interfere with the core code. No more broken sites from a PHP error in a hastily-installed plugin. Similarly, you can control their access into the database (instead of having a shared login that all code running in the application shares).<p>And so on, and so forth.<p>[1] I&#x27;m happy to forward copies of the proposal.

I don&#x27;t necessarily think it&#x27;s hysterical, but it certainly reads as a bit too extreme an interpretation, injecting unverifiable malice where legitimate interest in protecting people and prosecuting criminal activity likely resides.<p>Are there no other laws on the books state AGs can rely upon to facilitate investigation and prosecution of alleged criminal activity?<p>How exactly will holding one actor liable for the actions of a different actor increase the desired ends of further protecting and decreasing underage/illegal human trafficking?<p>How ought one defend the principle that service providers (and other third parties) are going to be required to interrogate everyone who posts an ad, violate their privacy, and work for free as surrogates for the criminal justice system to cover their ass? That burden seems awfully high.<p>If the goal is to stop underage sex trafficking, what is the argument for spending public time and money prosecuting alleged facilitators for the actions of those who are trafficking, instead of pursuing the criminals themselves, helped by the existing laws at investigators&#x27; disposal?<p>Are there not enough statutes criminalizing trafficking and other unwanted activity that can be enforced?<p>Do you find no problem at all with the letter stating that sites like backpage.com &quot;have constructed their business models around income gained from participants in the sex trade&quot;? From the standpoint of language, that sure appears to be playing rather loosely with words, suggesting that these business exist to facilitate sex trading, rather than recognizing they have constructed their business models around income gained from people placing classified ads, and that service is being [ab]used by sex traffickers, arguably against the providers&#x27; desires.<p>However, that is not the same as assessing whether this is a warranted change that ought to be made.",1374807036

6106220,comment,6105109,6105109,6,0,cletus,,,"Like many here I find the subject of finding life on other planets fascinating and consider it inevitable. What&#x27;s interesting is that the estimate of planet incidence is seemingly much higher than originally postulated by the Drake Equation [1].<p>A factor in the development of life, especially sentient life, is metallicity [2]. Almost all of the first 100 elements naturally occur on Earth. This is pretty amazing. Nuclear fusion in stars naturally produces elements up to iron [3]. S-capture is thought to produce elements up to Bismuth (atomic number 83). Elements higher than this are thought to be produced only in supernovae or other cataclysmic events.<p>It&#x27;s amazing to think that enough time has gone by in the Universe to take the abundant hydrogen and helium, form stars, have those stars run out of fuel and enough of them explode to scatter their elements to form heavy planets around later stars.<p>While heavy elements may not be required for life it seems less likely that starfaring sentience can form without them. Semiconductors for example require an odd mix of heavy elements.<p>It seems amazing that even we exist given that you need metals, a long-lived and stable star, likely billions of years of evolution, a sufficiently stable (and probably geologically active) planet with an atmosphere that has water in liquid form (a pretty narrow temperature band even taking into account different atmospheric pressures) and no cataclysmic events to happen in all that time (it seems to have been ~65 million years since the last big one).<p>It may just be that sentient life is fleeting. We&#x27;ve had &quot;civilization&quot; for X0,000 years, which is the blink of an eye. It&#x27;s entirely possible we&#x27;ll wipe ourselves out due to war or simply lack of (sufficiently cheap) resources in another blink. The problem isn&#x27;t lack of resources. They are plentiful in space. The problem is the cost of getting them if energy is anything other than free.<p>Additionally interstellar distances seem almost unconquerably large that one has to wonder if we&#x27;ll ever meet another sentient life form face to face (assuming they have faces).<p>Even if we do, one wonder what evolved elsewhere for facilitate communication. Will they see? Will the wavelengths of light they see cross over ours at all? These are questions we can only really speculate about.<p>It&#x27;s also been suggested (by Hawking among others) that we really don&#x27;t want to meet a much more advanced species as it will probably be bad for us, perhaps even an Outside Context Problem [4] and it seems unlikely given the rate of change we&#x27;re experiencing that another civilization will be at the same point as us.<p>We could of course be &quot;first&quot;. I mean someone has to be right? It does seem unlikely however. But I suspect there were many &quot;firsts&quot; (in the sense that they evolved independently and without any contact or evidence of other species).<p>The seeming lack of self-replicating robots, something we&#x27;ll almost certainly be able to build and start filling the galaxy with within a thousand years I&#x27;m sure, is also somewhat puzzling.<p>Personally I just hope we find evidence of extraterrestial life sometime soon as it will settle [5] a whole bunch of issues about us being &quot;special&quot; (in the typically religious sense).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/nucsyn.html#c1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/nucsyn.html...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Probl...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1235/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1235/</a>",1374804980

6106199,comment,6105109,6105892,4,0,Balgair,,,"There are many reasons: Here are a few:<p>A) The universe is very large. The nearest star is 4 and some change lightyears (ly) away. That means any message take over 8 years to get, process, and transmit to the nearest star. All other stars are further than that. Since we have been weakly radio broadcasting for about 100 years, the number of stars we have been able to speak with is at best 1600 (<a href=""http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_stars_within_50_light_years_from_earth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_stars_within_50_light_yea...</a>).<p>B)Messages get lost in noise. We assume that we are heard out in the universe. But it is very very difficult to hear a mosquito at a rock concert 100 miles from you. The reverse is true for us. Also, you have to know to look. The concert has been going on for 100 years but the venue, so to speak, is 4 billion years old. Also, you might be on the other side of the galaxy, or in another one entirely.<p>C)Messages aren&#x27;t understood as such. Do you know the protocol for USB to serial conversion? (If so I have many questions for you) We may think an actual message is just noise. Or, that noise is a message. We cannot possibly tell. Yes hopefully the other side will start out easy on us but define &#x27;easy&#x27; to an alien.<p>D)Lets assume that they have spotted us and are pre-sending signals. In what medium? We haven&#x27;t even figured out the basic laws of the universe yet. Heck Dark matter is ~25% of the mass-energy of the universe. The other ~75% is some crazy stuff we just labeled Dark Energy. We have no clue what is going on there. They may already be blasting us with data, but we just haven&#x27;t got the interstellar radio invented yet.<p>E) They simply don&#x27;t give a shit. What do we have that they want? Lets assume they are about 10,000 years older in tech than we are. Geologically speaking, thats nada, thats the last ice age. People were around then. And look now we have radios and iPads and ISS&#x27;s and stuff. 10,000 years is a lot of time to think and make stuff. What could we do in that much more time? Well, make a computer that&#x27;ll calculate just about anything, probably. And if your civilization is all entertained, why bother looking at the stars? Why bother with a,likely, giant telescope array that beams out gibberish for a thousand years. What stuff on Earth over 1000 years old? Not all that much but piles of rocks and some windows. The engineering of a giant thingy is very hard. And all for what? Some algae that you hope turns into a little curious squid or something?<p>F) They dont give a shit. Not because they are hedonistic but because they live under an ice-sheet the planet wide. Or they are at the bottom of a giant cloud where pressure is just right. Or they are frozen periodically in ammonia ice for 700 years. Or they have no idea of math and science because they don&#x27;t have nerves that work like that. Or because they don&#x27;t have cells at all. Or because they have no photoreceptors and can&#x27;t even begin to imagine light. Or because they think that thing we call matter is just a rounding error. Or because they already migrated into dark energy beings and are just waiting to see us.<p>G) We are just plain jane alone.",1374804572

6106183,comment,6105410,6106043,5,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Can&#x27;t the NSA spy on foreign operations without any legal oversight<p>Yeah. It would be kind of bizarre to have a military signals intelligence service where spying on foreign electronic communications was some kind of exceptional activity.<p>The whole <i>point</i> of the NSA is spying on foreign operations. The legal restrictions involving a &quot;secret court&quot; (the two courts themselves aren&#x27;t secret, though their proceedings tend to be) for oversight are to prevent the abuse of the &quot;foreign intelligence&quot; excuse as a backdoor for blanket domestic surveillance.<p>Or at least, that was the original purpose of FISA after exactly that kind of abuse. With various &quot;War on Terror&quot; era changes, its arguable that the purpose of the oversight has been reversed so that it now serves as a form of legal cover for the abuse of the &quot;foreign intelligence&quot; excuse as a backdoor for blanket domestic surveillance.",1374804234

The printer just locked up, with all the led&#x27;s blinking, and I kept power-cycling, to no avail.<p>While reviewing printers, I decided that the new one needed a &quot;scan to email&quot; feature.  Be warned, however, that some cheap printers have a feature that they call &quot;scan to email&quot;, but what they mean is: if you hook up our printer via usb to your pc, we&#x27;ll open outlook for you and attach your scan to it.  frak that, man.<p>What &#x27;scan to email&#x27; should really mean is: I walk to the (wirelessly connected) printer/scanner; I put something in the doc feeder; I then use a little display to either a) punch in someone&#x27;s email address or b) look up frequent email addresses.  And then I hit a button, and it scans them, and the printer mails it to them.  (As in, it speaks smtp.)<p>So I ended up with the HP 8600 Plus.  The &quot;plus&quot; is important - the plain 8600 does not have scan to email.  It&#x27;s been fine so far, though my bar is probably low.",1374804185

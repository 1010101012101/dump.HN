The airframes themselves can last essentially forever (well beyond the decades time frame that we&#x27;re discussing) if specified maintenance continues to be performed. Witness the many WWII and earlier aircraft still flying at seven or more decades of life.",1439056692

A lot of them are very much worth reading,  I personally would recommend:<p>Homer and a few Greek plays<p>Sample a bit of the great story teller Herodotus, then read the birth of historiography in Thucydides&#x27; <i>History of the Peloponnesian War</i>, which by itself is also very interesting and important (wonder why the Founder of the US didn&#x27;t like direct democracy?  There are very important object lessons in it).<p>Surely Plato and Aristotle deserve some attention!  The contents of the latter&#x27;s <i>Rhetoric</i> is essential for when you can&#x27;t reach people with dialectic.<p>Euclid&#x27;s <i>Elements</i> is still about as good as you can get for what it teaches.<p>Plutarch is great, but I really like that period of history.  To it I would add reading some of the earlier bits of Livy.<p>Read, or better yet listen to audio of a few of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, out loud you can follow their Middle English.<p>Machiavelli&#x27;s <i>The Prince</i> is still damned good, and a landmark in talking about politics as it is, not as how people would like it to be.<p>Shakespeare surely needs some attention by English speakers.  Swift&#x27;s <i>Gulliver&#x27;s Travels</i> were amusing when I read them in their original, and obviously very influential.<p>So, yeah, check out some of the classics.",1439056673

At least one plus is that the Gaming industry is more likely to take people without formal education (which might also be connected to the lower wages).",1439056634

I worked for a while at a Major Company that had an 80 character coding standard. It was universally despised on my team, where everyone had 2x27&quot; monitors.<p>Clearly you work in a different environment with different standards. I think more or less formal coding standards are important for any dev team. But they can be very different in different teams. Don&#x27;t assume what you have grown used to and comfortable with is some universal truth that must fit everyone for all times.<p>> But what should I guess? If I look at your code and see a 90 col line somewhere, how do I know you won&#x27;t drop a 100 col line in and hurt the readability again?<p>If we work on the same team, that is a discussion we&#x27;d need to have. Until then, let&#x27;s continue being happy in our respective circumstances, OK?<p>2. By &quot;Readability&quot; I mostly mean &quot;cognitive load&quot; for the human reader of the code. What to fit in a line is mostly decided by what&#x27;s an easily digestible chunk. If you can fit &quot;one thought&quot; into one line, that&#x27;s ideal. Line length <i>is</i> a factor, but just one of many, not one that overrides every other.<p>So, come to think of it, I actually <i>would</i> break out a variable solely for line length reasons. Absolutely not for the sake of 1 character, but probably for 20.",1439056607

I&#x27;m talking about his general thought process, since I have nowhere near the mathematical maturity to understand any of what he actually did.<p>I read the linked article and found a few nuggets that I think are of general interest, which I am quoting below:<p>&quot;To him no statement was ever the best one. He could always find something better, more general or more flexible. Working on a problem, he said he had to sleep with it for some time. He liked mechanisms that had oil in them. For this you had to do scales, exercises (like a pianist), consider special cases, functoriality. At the end you obtained a formalism amenable to dévissage.&quot; (p 1113)<p>“That was one principle of Grothendieck: every assertion should be justified, either by a reference or by a proof. Even a “trivial” one. He hated such phrases as “It’s easy to see,” “It’s easily checked.” When he was writing EGA, you see, he was in unknown territory. Though he had a clear general picture, it was easy to go astray. That’s partly why he wanted a justification for everything. He also wanted Dieudonné to be able to understand!” (p 1115)<p>“Grothendieck was not thrifty. He thought that some complements, even if they were not immediately useful, could prove important later and therefore should not be removed. He wanted to see all the facets of a theory.” (p. 1115)<p>Edit: I just found another quotation about him, not from this article, but too good not to mention here:<p>&quot;What interested him were problems that seemed to point to larger, hidden structures. “He would aim at finding and creating the home which was the problem’s natural habitat,” Deligne noted. “That was the part that interested him, more than solving the problem.”&quot; [2]<p>[1] The Rising Sea: Grothendieck on simplicity and generality <a href=""http://www.landsburg.com/grothendieck/mclarty1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.landsburg.com/grothendieck/mclarty1.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200409/fea-grothendieck-part1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200409/fea-grothendieck-part1.pdf</a>

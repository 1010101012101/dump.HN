4694462,comment,4694204,4694344,5,0,scarmig,,,"Why should the government preemptively keep tabs on anyone? Should the EPA and HUD be able to place sleeper agents in right wing community organizations to monitor them? Should pro-secessionist historians have their phones bugged and be trailed because they don't believe in the legitimacy of the federal state?<p>Aside from that general principle, there's also the reality of how its implemented. Most of the time sleeper agents are used to get evidence for trumped up, meaningless charges like ""interstate travel with intent to riot."" That's the best case scenario. At worst, these agents, on not finding something of even minor note, will attempt to incite violence to prove that ""those anarchists have really been violent all along."" See, for instance, Brandon Darby.<p>Edited to add: I do, for the record, think that if there's actual evidence that someone's trying to blow up a bridge, monitoring is appropriate (though I don't see why simply arresting them wouldn't usually be sufficient if that were the case). But usually these things are more fishing expeditions than anything, against people whose ideology the State finds distasteful.",1351105164

I think monitoring of some anti-government groups who rise to that level, such as some groups within the American militia movement, or groups such as Revolutionary Struggle in Greece, is legitimate.<p>But I don't think that, in a free country, the government should be monitoring people solely for their political views or what kind of books they read, without some actual evidence that they're a danger to anyone.

This will deploy my nodejs app across 3 AZs and setup load-balancing to them, deploy a Mongo replicaset across 3 AZs, setup authentication, and inject connection strings into the app's environment. It's also way cheaper than AWS.<p>The only difference with OP's setup is that the Mongo ports are publicly accessible.

<a href=""http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/recent-comments-widget-with-comment-excerpts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/recent-comments-widget-w...</a><p>I only see one query in there:
$comments = $wpdb->get_results(""SELECT $wpdb->comments.* FROM $wpdb->comments JOIN $wpdb->posts ON $wpdb->posts.ID = $wpdb->comments.comment_post_ID WHERE comment_approved = '1' AND post_status = 'publish' ORDER BY comment_date_gmt DESC LIMIT 150"");<p>I'm not sure why they are fetching 150 (why would you use that many?) but this query could be slow if you have many posts and many comments. Also, the goofy thing is that they are wiping out the cache every time and regenerating it instead of (say) incrementally adding to it.<p>I'd re-write it with an exists, which may help performance instead of a join (I've seen MySQL be pretty dumb with joins when you basically want an exists):<p>SELECT whatever
  FROM comments
 WHERE EXISTS( SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ... )
   AND comment_approved = 1
 ORDER BY
 LIMIT xx<p>In this case, MySQL may be having a problem where it can't read a multi-column index on post_id and comment_date_gmt DESC (I'm not sure if you can specify ordering in MySQL indexes, been a while), thus it's basically doing an in-memory sort of every approved comment (on a published post, which is likely all of them) in the system, which in his case was about ~200K. This could definitely take several seconds if there isn't enough memory to do it all at once (lots of swapping).<p>Personally, I'd try and modify the logic to be more conducive to indexing - do you really care if a comment was on a post that you made 10 years ago? MySQL also (IIRC) doesn't have bitmap indexes, so that ""comment_approved"" thing may or may not invalidate an index usage unless you add it to the index.<p>I'd probably do something like: the ""n"" (where n is < 150) most recent comments to a post made within the last n number of days, so you can really cut down on the number of rows you need to sort.",1351104531

Money is a funny thing - when you've got a $600K mortgage, and a couple kids heading off to college with $45K/year tuition, and your company gets acquired by Zynga, and you discover you have $500K worth of options that will mature if you stick around for a couple years, or you can walk away from all that, and go get a job as a $120K developer somewhere - well, let's just say it's very tempting to justify selling virtual cows for a couple years.<p>Understand there is a difference between working for a lame company, and a morally objectionable company.<p>I could make an argument that what Zynga did with Tiny Towers/Dream Heights wasn't that much different than what Samsung did with it's Galaxy Tab/iPad.

He's awesome.<p>For the semi-amateur, aquaponics is actually pretty tough to start up. Of course you need your initial equipment investment, but mostly getting a stable system is finicky and takes time. The longest part is getting your ""live rock"" fully active, i.e. nitriting and nitrating bacteria in the stones that convert the fish waste into stuff the plants can use. You essentially have a metastable system that takes a lot of supervision and some chemicals to setup, kinda like keeping a swimming pool clean, except you want just the right ratio of bacteria.<p>Furthermore, at his scales you can't monetize the fish. A possible choice of fish would be Tilapia, but at those scales it isn't worth it, but more importantly you can't cultivate those without a special license: IIRC they're considered invasive species in California. Maintaining such a license requires way more investment than what's possible at his level.<p>Anyhow, aquaponics are pretty awesome, but aren't yet economically viable compared to standard agriculture in most places* and there are legislative and economic issues that make it tough to kickstart.

We have customers and management to keep happy.  We have pressure to deliver these tasks.  But as we plow through our backlog week after week, it can sometimes feel like technology is passing us by.  Most of us do things in our spare time at home, but I feel like there should be some company time for this kind of work.<p>I find that management is supportive of this type of thing in principle, but that doesn't always mean they will accept having project work delayed.  The other issue is that some developers will take advantage of the time to goof off.<p>I'm curious to hear from other people if you have a strategy for R&D and other types of ""free"" time for developers?  Or, if you are a developer, how does it work at your company?  For example, learning a new language, investigating some new framework or just some wild idea.",1351101734

Give me the option of setting up my account with a public key instead of a password, and logging in by demonstrating that I have access to the corresponding private key.<p>One might object that this would mean I could only access my account from computers and devices where I keep a copy of my private key. True--but I'm ALREADY in that position for most sites, because I use long random passwords that I manage with a password manager running on my computers and devices.",1351101699

4694145,comment,4693277,4693945,4,0,msbarnett,,,"The problem is, that's really a different use case/value proposition than Square has in the US.<p>Square is a godsend for small businesses there. Square's all over Portland, for instance, not just at yard sales and craft faires but in real businesses because it's an absolutely disruptive form of payment that lets them avoid some onerous fees and setup costs, and it lets them accept debit because debit piggybacks on the credit system in the US.<p>But it's pretty crippled for that here in Canada. I know several small business, including my wife's, who were dying for Square to come here, because getting set up with a proper payment terminal in Canada is obscenely expensive for a small business.<p>But there's absolutely no way that they could use this as offered, with zero debit support, ubiquitous customer demand for debit usage, and no support for chip-reading in an environment where chip usage will be mandatory in 2 years and in which not using a chip already causes credit card transactions to be declined as 'suspicious' at a fairly high rate.",1351101666

The problem we're attempting to address is not necessarily the HTML/CSS/Javascript component of creating a tooltip, but rather the creation of a system and its continued maintenance.<p>When we hand rolled our own product tour code for a previous project, what we quickly learned was that maintenance was a nightmare. As soon as layouts updated or changed, editing the tooltips we had created already was tedious.<p>We, however, have plans for other features that we think could really add a lot more value. So if you don't see it now, perhaps later on when we roll them out.",1351101644

He built of automated power tracking tools to tell you your power usage and would turn off lights and things. Took home second place. I ended up winning with my solar subsidy ipad calculator (told if you could save money in your local area if you bought an electric car and install solar panels in your home over gasoline and unsubsidized power).

Modern systems are pretty good at discerning negative from positive comments.<p>You could probably find a way to mark negative and positive comments. Whether the resulting algorithm would be fine-grained enough to semi-reliably mark 'middlebrow dismissal,' I really don't know. Actually, as somebody who has worked on that stuff in the past, I don't think it would be very easy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis</a>",1351101616

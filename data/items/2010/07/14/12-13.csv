1514368,comment,1514248,1514248,0,0,pilif,,,"I'm spending most of my time maintaining a web application consisting of around 150k lines of PHP code. We (well - initially, it was just me) began development back in 2004 but since then the application has grown constantly.<p>Back in 04, I already felt some reservations against PHP, but that's what I knew best and that's what was most used for the web (Rails might have been around, but not really known - other ruby options were not quite there yet. Python I disliked and Java I. don't. touch.).<p>The application was written in PHP5, initially developed on some RC of 5.0.0 and I was careful to keep a clean style and not using deprecated code.<p>This lead to a quite clean application that I could really be proud of. And still: While it has suffered from sometimes not quite reasonable customer demands, it's still very good at what it's doing and while there might be some dead bodies rotting in the code, it's nowhere near daily WTF material (aside of some bugs we have a good laugh at and fix shamefully).<p>Still. I have some bad gripes with PHP that made me stop doing anything new in that language.<p>I can easily live with the usually quoted problems though:<p>- parameter order in library function? I don't care - my IDE lists them.<p>- Huge base library? I don't care as the stuff I don't need doesn't cost me anything but disk space and the stuff I do need, I'm glad is there.<p>- No namespaces? Yeah. Bit me a couple of times, but I can work around that - besides, with 5.3 we got namespaces, so this doesn't count any more<p>- Performance issues? It's fast enough for said application.<p>- Security? It's just as secure as any other language you can write insecure code in (i.e. all of them).<p>- Allows intermixing of layout and code? Sure, but you don't have to. If you have <i>any</i> sense what so ever, all requests go through a central /index.php and all other code is in some not-publicly accessible location and emits no html what so ever. All output is generated using any of the thousands of templating libraries.<p>What really disturbs me about PHP is its type conversion rules. 1 == '1' or even worse 'foobar' == 0, or '123n' == 123. This is cause for so many subtle bugs.<p>Just use === you tell me? Sure, but then you clutter your code with an insane amount of isset()'s and isint()'s and whatnot - the fact that the database library I'm using (pgsql) returns everything as strings doesn't help that cause either.<p>The other thing is the really clumsy syntax. Array literals, anonymous functions, closures (with explicit declaration of all variables of the outer scope you want access to), operators, even just the lack of named function parameters. The syntax is clumsy and all the elegant code you see even from JavaScript just gets bloated and unreadable once you port it to PHP.<p>These two issues made me do stuff in Ruby, Python(3) and lately a lot of Node.js, but the maintenance of that huge application remains to be the main part of my day-job and even though the two issues really bug me, it's still not painful enough to really be complaining (or, heaven forbid, port the thing to whatever-other-language-thats-currently-hip).<p>So in retrospect, while I'm as die-hard a PHP user as you can get with many, many lines of PHP under my belt and while I do find some of the stuff highly enjoyable (php's arrays that are also ordered hashes for example. Or the really easy and accessible web-server/HTTP integration), I also dislike it quite a bit to the point of being unwilling to start something new in PHP.",1279110800

For example, you could take $100k USD and buy a fixed annuity that would pay you approx. $650 a month for the rest of your life.  That number is pretty low due to interest rates being very low, and there is a risk of inflation.  You can get inflation adjusting annuities, and of course there are other secure cash flow vehicles.<p>I admire your ability to generate passive income.

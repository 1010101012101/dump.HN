In 1997, when you were 13 or so (you mentioned that you were 20 in 2004), the phrase ""white collar crime"" was at a relative low. Since then, the phrase ""white collar crime"" has grown in popularity in tandem with your maturation, which would account for your perception that the media is become more aware of it. However, the latest data available show that it is still not as popular is it was in 1996.<p>It may be the case that people are using the term ""white collar crime"" increasingly to refer to phenomenon which they used to just call ""fraud"". Another Google ngram search [1] shows that ""fraud"" is orders of magnitude more popular than ""white collar crime"".<p>There are plenty of other subjects where the popularity of equivalent nouns varies. For example, what do you call the people who fight wars? Soldiers? Troops? Warriors?

5237507,comment,5233138,5237394,2,0,pdonis,,,"<i>Presumably it's a snapshot of X at a single instant of time, the initial state of the thought experiment. The author should be clearer however.</i><p>I agree, if this is the author's intent it should be clearer. However, I'm willing to interpret the diagram that way for this discussion.<p><i>GR allows the escaping particles to never be overtaken by the horizon even though GR also demands that those particles move slower than the horizon does.</i><p>Because spacetime is curved, and the curvature limits the size of a local inertial frame straddling the horizon.<p>Consider a ""cloud"" particle in the right half of cloud in the Frame X diagram. In order to be moving at escape velocity at its location, it must be moving to the right at just a smidgen less than c. So it will move off the right edge of the diagram, and out of the region covered by Frame X, before the horizon catches it. Once it's out of Frame X, its worldline doesn't have to look like a straight line in Frame X, so it can continue to avoid the horizon; in fact it will gradually get farther and farther away from it.<p>Another way to see what's going on is to ask what a line of constant radius r looks like in Frame X. An observer at constant r close to the horizon has to accelerate very hard to stay at the same radius; that means a line of constant r in Frame X is going to look like a hyperbola in a spacetime diagram. If we imagine a bunch of observers at constant r passing through the cloud in the Frame X diagram as shown, they will all be accelerating very hard to the right, hard enough to keep the horizon from catching up with them; but a cloud particle moving at escape velocity just a little to the right of the horizon will be moving to the right faster than any of the constant-r observers, so he will pass them one by one as they accelerate; they won't be able to catch him. That means the escape velocity particle is increasing its radius with time, i.e., escaping.<p><i>If all the particles above the horizon are escaping then the cloud is splitting along the horizon.</i><p>Because the particles that are escaping have to be moving to the right at very, very close to the speed of light, whereas the particles that are not escaping are not. This is not a contradiction.<p>[Edit: I suppose the intent could be that <i>all</i> of the cloud particles are moving to the right at just a smidgen less than c; but if that's the case, the ones to the right of the horizon line will make it out of Frame X before the horizon catches them, as above, but the ones at or to the left of the horizon line obviously won't, because the horizon will move ahead of them.]<p><i>You can't say it has no location in space and then refer to its location in space even in relative terms like ""in the center of"".</i><p>I haven't done any such thing. You appear to be reading things into my posts that I am not saying. I have said, consistently, that the singularity is a moment in time. More precisely, the singularity is represented by a spacelike line. A ""place in space"" is represented by a timelike line, not a spacelike one. A point in space at an instant of time is just a point, not a line.<p><i>The singularity has a location in both space and time</i><p>No, it has a location in time only; it is <i>all of space</i> (or at least all of it inside the horizon) at that moment in time.<p><i>I suspect you're getting your idea from a cosmic singularity, like for the big bang.</i><p>The black hole singularity is indeed very similar to the big bang singularity; both of them are spacelike lines. The only real differences are that the black hole singularity is hidden behind a horizon, and that the black hole singularity is a future singularity while the big bang singularity is a past one.<p>You say you have taken classes on this material; have you raised the issues you are raising here in class?

5237505,comment,5237165,5237165,3,0,akurilin,,,"I wonder if JS is perhaps a bit too high level and internally complex to be a great first programming language to be taught to people with no CS fundamentals. Fully internalizing front-end development is no trivial task, and teaching JS out-of-context just by itself might not be super helpful, even though it's probably better than jumping straight to Java, which is also quite magical internally.<p>On the other hand I can see someone making the same argument about a low level language like C. One could claim that without full understanding of assembly, compilers, the ISA, and hardware-level optimizations you don't really gain much insight into computing.<p>Reminds me of the never ending debate about whether they should teach Java or assembly as first language in a CS curriculum.<p>There's probably no right answer, you just got to start somewhere and you'll figure things out on the long term.

No one knows exactly why, but farmers know a more valuable pig when they see one.<p>This is how capitalism works. If farmers can make more money by giving antibiotics to pigs, then they are going to do it. They'll argue that they have to because the farming market is increasingly controlled by a small number of giant companies, and if one doesn't do everything possible to increase yield then all of the others will.<p>Of course the only bacteria left alive will be the ones that are resistant to the antibiotics. This puts all of us in more danger and over time will cause more bizarre diseases. But that tradeoff is far into the future and no farming executive is going to forgo a quarterly bonus to prevent a problem 20 years from now.<p>I understand the tradeoffs, too.

Its core value proposition:<p>0) It can parse C header files and automatically construct bindings.<p>1) You can write Lua code that works directly on C data types <i>with C memory layout</i> and is JIT compiled. It makes it very easy to achieve performance within ~2x of C while still maintaining the expressiveness and extensibility of Lua. And if you miss writing OO C++, you can easily add methods to your C structs and they will be JIT compiled. See here <a href=""http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization</a> and search for ""Point Class with FFI cdata Struct"" and then ""Point Class Benchmarks"".<p>2) Because the memory layout matches C data types, it is trivial to swap out a Lua implementation of a core operation with a C implementation if that becomes necessary.<p>3) It is easy to write cross-platform systems code <i>without conditional compilation</i>  because the native calls through FFI can all be constructed dynamically through Lua (so instead of #ifdef WIN32 all over your socket code, you just have a single line checking for ffi.os == ""windows"" and then if necessary call the winsock initializer as ffi.C.WSAStartup(foo,bar)).",1361148193

This paragraph in particular was annoying:<p>""Weve been led into a culture that has been engineered to leave us tired, hungry for indulgence, willing to pay a lot for convenience and entertainment, and most importantly, vaguely dissatisfied with our lives so that we continue wanting things we dont have. We buy so much because it always seems like something is still missing.""<p>To start, this almost implies that there's a room full of Old Powerful White Men (let's be honest, that's what you imagine) figuring out how to raise little consumer sheep.  Like it's a big conspiracy or something. Even worse, the government must be in on it, otherwise I wouldn't have to work 8 hours and feel tired all the time! Well, part of this 'conspiracy' is called 'marketing', and if you have an issue with that, then please address it with a logical argument. I think most of HN is fine with marketing, otherwise nobody would get to witness these new startups.<p>Regarding the 8 hour workday: this is an economics argument more than anything. Again, either address it properly or leave it be. What would be nice would be an alternative suggestion. However, I don't think travelling at large with a MBP sipping mojitos on the beach and skyping clients is something society at large can start doing. But the author probably can. (There's a bit of an interesting aside - should intelligence and technical skills afford you more freedom?)<p>To wrap up, what really bothers me with that paragraph, and this post in general, is this: it's being implied that personal happiness and fulfillment (so nothing ""feels missing"") is not a personal responsibility. What? Let's look at that last sentence again:<p>""We buy so much because it always seems like something is still missing.""<p>Just because consumerism isn't ""filling your inner void"" doesn't mean it caused it. That's not to advocate for or against consumerism, just to suggest that there are other alternatives to these problems.

5237397,comment,5236180,5236180,13,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is an interesting tease. I'm not sure why they are teasing it (presumably to get developers) but conceptually from a game perspective it could be interesting.<p>I played World of Warcraft from 1.0 (actually 0.9 but whatever) to 4.0 (a bunch of years, I've got the pets to prove it :-) Felt it finally completely jumped the shark with the Panda thing and the simplification of the world to the point of banality. As I told the Blizzard guy who surveyed me about it, I don't go into the library at the Middle School to play DND with the kids there using rules they can understand, I <i>do</i> play complex scenarios with other adults. I think Eve Online gets this, Blizzard has yet to internalize it.<p>WoW was created to compete with EverQuest, which it did, way more successfully than even Blizzard expected. But it ran into the problem that the storyline, while interesting, and which character progression suitably nerfed, it got boring. And adding new story lines helped, but they had to add better gear to keep people grinding for it, and the basically I think they ran into the law of diminishing returns. Making your character twice as powerful was cool, but it made the previous game a bit silly, doubling that again and now you could single-handedly waltz through the old end-game raids (which had been designed for 40 simultaneous players in their best gear), and the dissonance gets to you. It's kinda fun, like God mode, but it's also hard to imagine a world where you could be this powerful and everyone else couldn't just fix the worlds problems without you. When the story line is ""we're under seige by the forces of evil"" and your character, through a series of quests, singlehandedly overwhelms all that evil? Its like reading Nancy Drew mysteries instead of Agatha Christie mysteries. To simplified to be enjoyable.<p>Then there is Eve Online, which is similarly durable to WoW and yet has a much larger percentage of retained adult participants. I expect for the reasons that Eve does <i>not</i> constrain the behavior and doesn't make it ""digestible"" to people who don't understand that money can buy power and power can be manipulated. Compare getting into a high end Eve Corporation with a high end WoW guild. Interesting difference.<p>And then there is the business model. Everquest, WoW, and Eve, all have pay-per-month subscriptions. That is nice, but Zynga and others have shown it can be just as, if not more, profitable for the company to run the internal economy. Something Blizzard shied away from on WoW, embraced on Diablo 3, and Eve has had I think a mixed relationship with (but I may be completely wrong on that I'm not as familar with the online Eve currency market)<p>That suggests that there may be a market for a persistent world, with 'stories' for interest but not necessarily character gain, an environment where you every bit of content is available to you (perhaps not as successfully as you would like) from the moment you log in, and where you can use economic means or game-play means to achieve goals. Combined with a system for mixing up character strengths, items, and what not. With the game company running the economy, and taking a tax on that economic growth to fund the actual game. You have to be willing to bet that for everyone out there who will diligently cut rocks or what ever for a .001% chance at a powerful gem, there will be 10, 100, 1000 people who will just fork over fifty cents to a couple of dollars to just buy one. And playing the average revenue per gamer game rather than the monthly fee model.<p>Bootstrapping something like that will be extraordinarily hard, but if successful consider how much Blizzard would have profited if they had been the 'gold farmers' which at one point was estimated at a several hundred million dollar a year business in its own right.<p>Tending something like this, keeping it fun and profitable will also required very deft execution since it is tempting to take too much money off the table early on.<p>I hope the Bungie guys pull it off.",1361146393

I know the material well enough to point out contradictions in your thinking.<p>> If that's true, the the diagram that's shown cannot portray a steady state of Frame X, as it claims to do.<p>I don't see such claim made there. Presumably it's a snapshot of X at a single instant of time, the initial state of the thought experiment. The author should be clearer however.<p>> The horizon plane is moving to the right in the diagram at the speed of light, and none of the cloud particles can move at the speed of light, so the horizon plane will quickly overtake them and be to the right of the entire cloud.<p>GR allows particles above the horizon to be escaping to infinity (since the escape velocity there is less than c), in which case the horizon plane will never overtake them. GR allows the escaping particles to never be overtaken by the horizon even though GR also demands that those particles move slower than the horizon does. If all the particles above the horizon are escaping then the cloud is splitting along the horizon.<p>> Sure, but you won't be pointing to the singularity in the center of the black hole there.<p>That's a contradiction. You can't say it has no location in space and then refer to its location in space even in relative terms like ""in the center of"". The singularity has a location in both space and time (a location in spacetime, if we ignore the technicality that spacetime breaks down there), and I could validly point to it now, no matter its location in my future. I suspect you're getting your idea from a cosmic singularity, like for the big bang. In that case there would be no single location in space you could point to now; it has a specific location in time only.",1361146349

I'd very much enjoy seeing a video or reading in-depth about how one is designed and constructed, or about real-world uses for such a technology.<p>I do fail to appreciate a video that is entirely focussed on using one to knock things down, when said things are obviously constructed to be as weak and fragile as possible.  Thus, the reaction of the presenter seems to me somewhat contrived and incongruous.  It appears on the face to be typical over-the-top T.V. production and I, personally, don't find it particularly impressive.<p>Since you are obviously involved in this stuff, do you have any links to some material that talks about the technology itself?

1444565,comment,1443036,1443407,0,0,amttc,,,"Maybe. It depends on if we're talking about individual applications or just the desktop experience in general.<p>The thing about people using applications like Photoshop and Word is that they have established workflows that its users have come to expect. From a design perspective, they're pidgeonholed because any significant UI change means that they would have to retrain the vast majority of its users. So Adobe and MS make minor tweaks to its UI instead. Admittedly, MS made a big change with the ribbons ui element, but you get the picture.<p>Open source stuff has the advantage (I guess you could call it that) of having a much larger volume of new users and a much smaller volume of old users, so there's more room to experiment with different UIs to solve the problem of getting people to interact meaningfully with the programs. I'd say for the vast majority of the projects, the UI is an afterthought so it ends up being poorly designed. Even so, the opportunity is there.<p>The desktop is a little different though, there's already a load of user expectations that you have to live up to. The space for proposing solutions is a lot smaller. Riding on the coat tails of OSX may not be a bad idea so long as the developers understand the reasons why Mac made the design decisions that they did and adjust accordingly.<p>At least that's how I feel. Trying to innovate isn't a bad thing, it has to lead to failure first before you get it right.",1276952014

I have been thinking a lot about them. I have ideas about people selling digital goods viz. writers selling ebooks. I have been thinking about the piracy concerns and ways to mitigate them. It won't be upto me but upto the writers/musicians to embrace the new media and make up for the piracy with advertisement in the ebooks, like there are advertisements in actual magazines.<p>But then this begs the question, why would advertisers pay for amateur writer's creations, and why would professional writers sell ebooks with me? Well, for one thing, if you are selling through me, you don't have the publisher's cut and all the money is yours. You can very well sell it on Amazon et al., but here you can manage everything yourself with just a minuscule monthly fee.  Setting up a store here would be dead simple.<p>I have been thinking about integrating it with twitter. For example,  you just twit ""Special discount. Check out <a href=""http://foo.bar/2x813"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.bar/2x813</a> and the customer gets either a lightbox popped up on twitter(if he is on a browser) or redirected to the browser if he is on some other client(if possible). There are some implementation issues, but it's mostly doable.<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. I have other ideas. For one thing, I don't think shopify provides attachable shopping cart widgets, which is something very useful to you if you already have an online presence.<p>>  find a differentiator you can use as a UVP.<p>And what is stopping shopify from implementing the same stuff?

If I'm reading your post correctly you have about a 1% user conversion rate, so I would say you're average based on my dataset of 1 other site ;).<p>You really don't know what your conversions are yet though.  I'd say wait another week if you want to get an idea of your actual conversion rate, possibly much longer if you have a long sales cycle.  My site tends to have a very short time-to-buy, so it's much easier to get an idea for these numbers.",1276948923

You need a good answer to this question, and so far, I don't see the Unique Value Proposition.<p>Some people are suggesting you do Market Research to find this, others are suggesting that you find a narrow niche to begin with and customize to fit their needs, others are suggesting you outline the features.

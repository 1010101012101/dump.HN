It doesn't really matter if it exists - what matters is that there's a perception that it exists). Instead, take courses that ""look hard"". Stay in your major.

1320392,comment,1317381,1320127,0,0,goodside,,,"I think you're confusing two very different points in the history of the Universe. The CMBR was emitted after the decoupling of matter and radiation, as you mentioned, but this event was over 300,000 years after the Big Bang. And you are correct that there could, in principle, be observable signals emitted before this event in the form of neutrinos or gravitational waves. The observable universe, however, is defined not by reference to the signals emitted at the decoupling event, but rather the start of the inflationary epoch, which was merely <i>10^-36 seconds</i> after the Big Bang. So, the OU is big enough that it encompasses all of the space from which any signal, even neutrino or gravitational, that might have been emitted 13.75 billion years earlier that could eventually reach us.<p>But, terminology aside, this still leaves your question: How much farther could we see if we could pick up neutrinos or gravity waves? Not a whole lot, unfortunately. Most of the expansion of the early Universe occurred during the (aptly named) inflationary epoch, and that lasted less than a tiny fraction of a second, leaving very little time for a neutrino or gravitational wave to travel before the Universe became very large. The expansion that occured in the following 300,000 years is negligible by comparison to that first tiny moment, so you won't get a whole lot more than 300,000 light years out of those neutrinos. I'm too tired and lazy to do the math to find the radius of the surface of last scattering, so I'll run a quick Google search, and...<p>The final answer is that the <i>visible</i> universe, or that which is not obscured by the opaque matter that dominated in the first 300K years, is a sphere with radius of 45.35 billion light years, while the <i>observable</i> universe, which is everything that can observed in principle, is just a bit further at a radius of 46.5 billion light years. So, yeah, we've got most of it covered.",1273036723

I've seen some depressing things from the phone teams, but I wanted to give the Kin team the benefit of the doubt for their unique approach. However, this review makes me genuinely embarrassed to say I used to work there. How do you even get a ""Try again after restarting your phone"" error message past a code review? My team certainly would not have allowed that.",1273036314

This is done usually by lobbying for regulations that harm competitors, while leaving the company relatively unharmed (differences in scale following consolidation are natural, for example, but additional regulatory burden will keep small upstarts from entering the market - think about the way milk is sold in California). Without regulatory assistance, unearned monopolies are impossible to maintain.",1273036277

I can't decide if Microsoft is scared to leverage the Xbox brand or scared to delude it. As far as the price goes clearly these devices were conceived at a time when SmartPhones were $200+ and there may have been a bigger market for limited functionality devices at a lower price point. The one thing that stands out to me is the Kin Studio. I would like to have a similar feature on my iPhone.",1273036247

Smart students still have the same fears of not being a success and the same draw to something that promises the possibility of greatness, but they're looking into other outlets. Anecdotally, I've seen a pretty big handful of my non-technical friends applying to Google and similar places. Googlers seem to have a nice lifestyle and the company has done a good job at fashioning their image such that they're seen as an instrument of social change (google.org), innovation, and ethical consistency.",1273036088

Not only do IT people have little incentive to reach that level of perfection, they often aren't really coders and wouldn't be able to get a budget through that gave them enough man-hours to have time to make something like Dropbox. It's not worth it to the university, in general, to pay the full development cost of an extremely well-done implementation of a complex, nonessential system. The economies of scale aren't there.<p>And I'm still a few months away from college. It looks like Stanford has some pretty good systems overall, but just as a datapoint, the design of Axess (the system that appears to handle pretty much everything--course signup, financial aid, etc) is much uglier (and a little harder to use) than any commercial site I use. It gets the job done, it probably dates back to when all sites looked like that, and the people in charge of it don't have enough incentive to give it a facelift.",1273035880

Yes, we've all seen the hundreds of articles basically saying ""Steve Jobs thinks flash 'sucks' for various reasons and will never run on the iPhone OS;"" however, it is clear that other companies, like Google, Nokia, ect., have an interest in Flash. Flash will run on the Android phones (for example), and I know Google has been ""motivating"" Adobe to get moving.<p>All in all, I would say it is safe to say Google has been a great motivator for the engineers at Adobe, not Steve.

974183,comment,973803,973803,0,0,idebug,,,"in all my experience in hiring at my company, the one thing i find that 99% of applicants fail to understand is that a company is hiring a person to fit a certain need that is being unmet. therefore, listing a long resume full of all the impressive things you have done, but are completely irrelevant to the position being offered, is a waste of space and time and will increase your chances of being overlooked. you really need to think about catering your resume to the job and leave as much else as you can as a footnote.<p>if you do manage to get to the interview process, ask about the job you are being interviewed for so you can get a better understanding. a job interview is a conversation, so it goes both ways. try to find out why they are looking for a new employee. for example, they may be looking for a system administrator to do sysadmin tasks, but if you ask further, they might tell you that they are in the process of trying to scale their systems, at which point you can talk about your past experience or what ways your might go about developing a scalable architecture. make yourself relevant.<p>all too often, candidates just come in and sit quietly, waiting for the interviewer to ask them question after question, trying to pull information out of them and then it simply becomes checklist of questions to tick off (while looking at your watch) before thanking the interviewee and showing them the way out.",1259841509

I know it's not at home -- staying up all night just to get some free time for innovation doesn't scale well when you have a family and a day job. Home has its share of distractions. And I know it's not in the office, at least not the space we're in today.<p>Every time I let my thoughts wander on this subject, the same vision comes to mind. I'm sitting in a comfortable armchair, in a large room or atrium that's lit primarily by daylight coming through large windows. There are nice green plants everywhere, including a large fern-ish looking tree (apologies; botany has never been my strong subject) next to me. There are people coming and going nearby, but their noise is white noise, and it's not terribly distracting. I've been in this place a hundred times, in a hundred different locations.<p>It's a hotel lobby.""<p><a href=""http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/innovation-101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/innovation-101</a>",1259840939

Just yesterday I was generating a PDF packet with pdftk, and had a command line of the form ""pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf blank.pdf file3.pdf cat output outfile.pdf"" that I kept having to re-run (because I'd modified file2.pdf) or tweak (because I added file4.pdf).  It's possible that the first pdftk would have been quicker in a GUI---though I'm not convinced---but in the aggregate there's no <i>way</i> a series of GUI ops would have been faster.

My entire major is devoted to entrepreneurialism; a huge part of the major is meeting other people and getting ideas going. So classes often have a relaxed environment in which people are encouraged to talk to one another. Facebook's useful there, also. I personally find it much easier to judge people and their ideas online; in person everybody seems beautiful and brilliant.<p>A huge part of what you get when you pay for college is access to all those people. Classes are valuable on one level specifically <i>because</i> they put you in a defined context with a slew of other people. I'm a people person, but I hate randomly going up to people, and I don't like talking to people without there being a reason for us to talk. Classes connect me to people, which is just as valuable service as the things I learn.<p>I'll also add that in the group I'm working with right now to launch things, all the communication's handled entirely over Facebook. We tried Backpack and Skype and Google Wave, and none of them could handle the conversation as well as informally talking to one another on Facebook did.",1259839633

So if someone is coming on board and taking risk, that risk needs to be compensated.  Usually we have brought people in at below market wages and made up the difference in the form of options which get them ""whole"" on total comp.

2906290,comment,2906121,2906121,4,0,nirvana,,,"I'm dealing with this very question right now, only I'm coming from a different angle.  I've already picked the language, but I'm attempting to build a framework in it that makes it work in a very different domain.<p>What I'm working on is sort of an answer to node.js.  It is a coffeescript platform (use js if you prefer) built on top of erlang.  So, the coffeescript runs in an erlang environment.  This means, when you call into the DB, this spawns off an erlang process. Your collection of coffeescript functions can be executed on any number of cores, or any number of hosts.  In fact, your handler for a web request can be spread out all over a cluster, with each function running on the node that has the data... or it can all run on a single node, but across many processes. (to some extent the amount of distribution will be controllable as a configuration parameter-- so if you're doing processing that analyzes big data, you can move your code to the data and run it there, lowering the cluster communications load, but if the data is small, it may make sense to keep handling a request constrained to a single node where everything is conveniently in RAM.)<p>This is accomplished by compiling the coffeescript in to javascript and running the javascript on a vm, specifically erlang_js, though I'm looking at going with V8 via erlv8. Your code and the libraries are all rendered into a single ball of javascript that we'll call the ""application"" that is handed off to various nodes.<p>How do I plan to get sequential code to work in a fundamentally distributed environment?  That's the $64,000 question and why I'm bringing this up here-- I could be doing it wrong.<p>The plan is simple:
1. The developer needs to know that their application is not running in a single environment and account for that.
2. Each entry-point provided by the developer to the platform's API is assumed that it could be running in isolation in a separate process.
3. There's a shared context that all the processes have access to. (an in-RAM Riak database where the bucket is unique to a given request, but the keys are up to the developer.) 
4. The APIs let the developer give callback functions which will be called when the data is available. (EG: ""Go fetch a list of blog posts"" could have a callback that is invoked when the list is returned from Riak. 
5. There's a set of known phases that each request goes thru, in a known sequence, and we don't move on to the next phase until the processes spawned by the previous phase are finished.  All of the phases are optional, so the developer can implement as many as they want or only a single one. The phases are: init, setup, start, query, evaluate, render, composite, finish functions.  The assumption is that you can  get your app to work with 9 opportunities to do a bunch of DB queries and get the results. 
6. Init will be called when the request comes in.  Init can cause any number of processes to be started (DB queries, or map reduce, etc.) They will all be finished, and their callbacks called (if any) before setup is called. Setup can also spin up any number of processes, and so on.   All of these are optional and a hello world app might just implement one (it doesn't matter which.)<p>So, the developer can write in a sequential style, they are called regularly in sequence and know for each phase the previous phase's queries will have data.  Each phase can cause more queries, or even spin up other apps, that will be rendered before the next phase.  And they get the results from a context that is always available.<p>This way, init, start ,query and render could all run on different nodes, though they would run in sequence and each one would have access to the shared context for the query.<p>Another way of looking at this, and the way it <i>might</i> be implemented, is that each of those phases is a long running process that lives on, and is invoked with different contexts each time to handle its part of handling a query.  (So this lets us, or the developer, experiment with the right way to arrange things for best resource utilization, since the results can be dramatically different depending on the kind of work the application needs to do.)<p>That's how I'm running a sequential language in a genuinely distributed manner...you can think in callbacks, or in phases, or both, and your coffeescript really can run in parallel.<p>A downside of this, though, is that you couldn't write a request handler that, say, generated a random key, did a lookup on the database, and then would loop and do that again until it got a result it liked. You have your 9 phases, and that's it, for a given request.  However, there is an API to invoke another application (e.g.: you could have a login application that is responsible for part of your page, so, rather than implement a login/logged-in area on each page, you write it once and include it as a sub-application.)  Conceivably you could do recursion but I haven't thought about the consequences of that yet.  This does sort of lock you into a specific way of doing things, which is why there are 9 phases, if you only need 3, only implement 3... but if you need all 9 you have them.<p>I'm sure I've managed to make something that is not so complicated sound muddy... This works for me, since coffeescript is convenient, and it is easy for me to think in terms of erlang concurrency... but it might be an adjustment for js programmers who are used to setting variables and expecting them to be there later on... (you'd just have an API that store the values under a key.)<p>If you're interested in this project, you can find periodic announcements on twitter @nirvanacore  I expect to have an alpha sometime in late September, and a Beta sometime after Riak 1.0 (on which this is based) ships.<p>Apologies if it seems like I'm hijacking a thread here... obviously my thoughts are about concurrency, but I am differing from the author in assuming json for common data structures, and directly programming in coffeescript/javascript.  I'm not too worried about compiled speed- I'm more interested in concurrency than performance.  I'd rather add an additional node and have a homogenous server infrastructure and no thinking about server architecture... than try to optimize for single CPU performance, etc.",1313834381

Currently (and for the foreseeable future), all of these are satisfied (working from home, using whatever tools I see fit, on a project that will make a couple of million dollar difference for the client). Challenge level is low, but that by itself doesn't lend itself to working on business problems specifically (eg. some machine learning ideas has a much higher challenge+reward rating).<p>I'm currently studying investing to figure out how to make the best of this situation long-term, and outsourcing for getting additional leverage. None of these are satisfying my intrinsic motivation of building high-impact online businesses -the core purpose I've been working on for the past 6 years.<p>Is there something wrong with me? Am I being maladjusted for still trying to achieve the same goals, but for obsoleted reasons?

I think that view fundamentally leads to disastrously bad places. It leads to assuming you're correct and looking for <i>confirmation</i> instead of <i>truth</i>.<p>Truth is often unpleasant. Confirmation is easily found, even for the stupidest and craziest arguments - look at some of the clearly insane views that people hold with no backing.<p>Why do they think that way?

2906235,comment,2905686,2905966,4,0,morrow,,,"Interesting observation - I think another way to describe this phenomenon is that every society has to convince it's members to accept their individual role as members of society in order for it to function (you might argue that is society's only purpose).  We can't all be kings, senators, business tycoons, etc. -- someone has to be the janitor or the street sweeper or the factory worker, and society's basic purpose is to re-enforce the individual's choice in accepting their fate.<p>Long enough ago, this was as simple as raising certain classes and races of people as slaves and telling them what to do and enforcing it with violence.  However it seems that no matter how much you try to control it, societies eventually achieve enough self-awareness of the general inequality of things to revolt and re-order society to make things more fair.  The next system of control is then instituted, and is seen as a vast improvement, and thus accepted by those who rebelled against the previous, even though it may be simply a more complex version of the previous system (slave-owners/slaves,land-owners/indentured servants,royalty/peasants,ruling class/working class, etc.).<p>In this way, I believe it's similar to the quote from HHGTTG: ""There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.""  I think that what happens is every time a society reaches the level of self-awareness required to realize what's happening to them and has the will to change it, a simply more complicated and harder to understand and harder to destroy system ends up replacing it.<p>I think in this way, you can describe the cyclical nature of societies coming and going, and applying the reasons behind this fundamental change,  understand why your theory of war being beneficial fits right in: war simply leaves no room for questioning society's demands of the individual.  The reason this works is that members of a militarized or war-time society are indoctrinated, and those who end up members of the military trained from day one to obey orders and follow authority.  After leaving the military, if you do you happen to survive and get out of the war, working a factory job and having a few kids is damn near paradise compared to the hell you went through.  It is a very effective way to keep individuals from questioning their place in society or the fairness of it's structure and thus why I think it has the society-prolonging effect you've observed.  War shifts individual's thinking  from long-term (career, legacy, mark on the world, children's future) to short term (survival, employment, simply procreating).<p>If you buy into any of what I am saying, you might also hypothesize that the U.S came close to becoming self-aware of and motivated to change it's societal inequalities around 2008 with the reaction to the Government bail-outs and the housing market crash. I think the only reason that energy hasn't really gone anywhere yet is twofold: 1) With the economy in the shape it's in, it makes those who are employed more happy with their current employment situation than usual, and more unlikely to try to change things in general, since they are ""lucky to even have a job in this economy"", and aren't really feeling the inequality in their day to day lives.  And it's not bad enough to where mass unemployment is giving people enough free time to organize and actually try to restructure the way our government works.  2)  The act of electing public officials to office helps stave off the idea that ""we need to restructure society"" as it lets people restructure a symbol of society to them.  Elections act as a relief valve for political pressure, since it allows people to 1) have input and make changes and 2) it buys time for the newly elected official to ""get settled"" in their office before people become dissatisfied again or economic/societal conditions improve, whichever comes first.<p>Sources: Just my theory on the matter, please point out where I am wrong (I'm sure I am in more than one way)",1313831436

In my social circle there were 8 marriages between Japanese (all women) and foreigners. 4 ended in the past 3 years and were mainly attributed to different expectations of intimacy. The article <a href=""http://goo.gl/QlAfx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/QlAfx</a> gives a very good description. I am unable to find a reputable source, but if you search for the frequency of intercourse, Japan will always be the lowest on the list. Japanese simply dont want / need to have sex. Furthermore mentioning that you love someone is very uncommon. Frequent physical contact (e.g. hugging) with spouses / kids is not expected. It is a different culture.",1313831366

As of today (8/19/2011), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) has market capitalization of $81.22bn. It is not at all impossible for Apple to buy Amazon. I can think of the following benefits.<p>First, iCloud can leverage AWS. Apple does not need to reinvent or relearn the data center management again. AWS itself is a fast-growning profitable business. With AAPL services running on it, the AWS brand will also get reinforced.<p>Second, Jeff Bezos can replace Steve Jobs as the CEO of AAPL. According to Gruber, Jeff Bezos is the best potential outside successors. I agree with him on this.<p>Third, combining AMZNs online digital content retailer business, AAPL can dominate the market. The company will have more power in negotiating with content publishers.<p>What is your thoughts on the potential acquisition?",1313831134

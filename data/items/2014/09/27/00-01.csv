8375644,comment,8374810,8375558,12,0,tryp,,,"Modern DDR2 SDRAM busses are a bit more involved. They use the address lines as a command word for putting the chips in the correct &quot;link trainging&quot; mode at startup, selecting burst access lengths, enabling self-refresh mode, setting on-die termination values, &cetera so they may not be swapped. Each &quot;byte lane&quot; of 8 data lines is allowed to have a different signal path length difference between clock and data (that is measured during training for compensation during operation) and signals may be swapped arbitrarily within the byte lanes.<p>Furthermore, the high-performance DDR3+ controllers typically hash the data word with the address so that when a repetitive data stream is transmitted it doesn&#x27;t generate more EMI. (Some controllers also hash with a random seed gaining resilience against chilling the DIMMs of a running machine and reading them out on another machine in search of sensitive data.)<p>I find it really cool that any time you change the DIMMs in your computer, it essentially has to measure the length of the wires to the ICs on it. (I&#x27;ve found it less cool to have to manipulate timing values to compensate for deviation from PCB design rules, but thankful that it&#x27;s possible. The fun of board bring-up.)

Those who didn&#x27;t, don&#x27;t get quite the same picture.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of excessive abstraction either - the main thing I use it for is to reduce code duplication, which IMHO is one of the real benefits. Code that contains lots of functions-called-once or classes-used-once feels like a terribly inefficient and obfuscated way to do something, and far less straightforward than it could be.<p>The whole &quot;abstraction is good because it allows us to build large complex systems&quot; notion is all too common in beginning courses in programming/software engineering architecture, and it tends to make people think that large complex systems are also good. Thus the feeling that somehow all software should be large and complex, and the resulting architecture-astronautism and disturbingly inefficient software. I completely disagree - abstraction should be taught as being a necessary evil for managing complexity, for use only when that complexity is actually justified and cannot be simplified further. Abstraction hides complexity but does not eliminate it; in fact it could be said that it probably adds to it. Code hidden by abstraction is still code that gets executed, consumes resources, and could contain bugs.",1411778759

8375589,comment,8374345,8375320,3,0,kazinator,,,"Not really. Inlining can be done by mechanically incorporating the called function into the caller, in a way that respects lexical scopes. This will result in identical semantics.  Then the resulting bloated code is optimized: subject to caching optimizations, common subexpression optimizations and whatnot. These have to obey the usual rules for not deleting or reordering side effects. The issue you&#x27;re referring to boils down to the fact that in an imperative language, we cannot assume that two occurrences of a variable X can be replaced by the same value, because X may have been assigned in between. So compilers have to do flow analysis to discover in what part of a call graph does a given variable have a stable value.<p>E.g. if we have a silly C function like<p><pre><code>    int accumulate(int x, int y)\n    {\n       global += (x + y);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nand then call it in two places:<p><pre><code>    accumulate(s, t);\n    accumulate(u, v);\n</code></pre>\nthe inlining is almost like just macro-expansion of the above into:<p><pre><code>    {\n      int x = s;  /* &quot;parameter&quot; passing */\n      int y = t;\n      global += (x + y);\n    }\n\n    {\n      int x = u;  /* &quot;parameter&quot; passing */\n      int y = v;\n      global += (x + y);\n    }\n  </code></pre>\nwe don&#x27;t have to care about side effects when we are doing this expansion. That&#x27;s the job of later optimization.<p>The later optimization pass can worry about things like whether global is volatile-qualified. If it is, then the best that can be done is:<p><pre><code>     global += s + t;\n     global += u + v;\n</code></pre>\nthese can&#x27;t be merged or re-ordered.  And so this stays faithful to the original function calls. If global isn&#x27;t volatile, then more can be done:<p><pre><code>     global += s + t + u + v;</code></pre>",1411777460

For example, issues with Swift generics isn&#x27;t immediately apparent. It&#x27;s only after using them for a while that you can say that the missing features ARE indeed lacking for everyday usage, and this is not just a theoretical problem.<p>Similarly, the problems with Optional isn&#x27;t really obvious from the beginning. (And optionals seemed like such a win initially. Built in Optionals! The language built to support it everywhere. Seamless interop with ObjC. Safe unwrapping! Syntax sugar for flatmap etc etc. And then it ended up being just as much a burden as it was a help)<p>This would suggest that the very reason that you see this as &quot;an uniformed post with several questionable arguments&quot; is actually because you have very little experience in the language. Consequently you see what you believe are meaningless or &quot;questionable&quot; arguments, simply because you believe someone wrote the blog article with similar [limited] experience with the language.<p>Since his issues aren&#x27;t obvious at a glance, you conclude that they are false, never entertaining the idea that they represent a much deeper understanding of the language than you have achieved.",1411777357

When the FBI has a warrant they are legally entitled to break into your house even if you don&#x27;t want them to.<p>Yes, they have the right to break into your phone. That doesn&#x27;t stop me from having a lockable door. It is perfectly legal and has always been so. There was a fight about it in the 90s with PGP and such.<p>So you are agreeing with me. Except for the fact you put &quot;except it isn&#x27;t&quot; without providing any actual proof it isn&#x27;t. Because y&#x27;know, there is no actual proof I&#x27;m wrong.<p>Me:\n> The key phrase there is &quot;break in&quot;. As in, they acquire access without the consent of the owner. In this case, the &quot;door&quot; is the encryption key which they are expected to acquire and/or break so that they can gain access.<p>You:\n> Your original claim was that you were being asked the equivalent of leaving your house unlocked for their convenience, which is a wild exaggeration.<p>That isn&#x27;t a wild exaggeration. Plain text being stored accessibly from the internet <i>is</i> the equivalent of leaving your house unlocked. Its basic, fundamental security. Its why you hash your password and store your backups in an encrypted container.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why basic, standard precautions any competent IT person engages in is &quot;wild exaggerations&quot;.<p>Me:\n> No, it isn&#x27;t. If I don&#x27;t have the ability to prevent 3rd parties from entering my house, it isn&#x27;t a wild exaggeration.<p>If strangers can walk into my house without breaking in and do WTF they want, it isn&#x27;t locked by any sane definition.<p>You:\n> Of course it is. You keep your front door locked, you might have a lockable screen door and bars on the windows, or a burglar alarm or a number of other security precautions, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you don&#x27;t live in an impregnable fortress or a bank vault.<p>Now that is a wild exaggeration. Encryption is not an impregnable fortress.<p>Me:\n> <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/</a>\n> 1) The app store is still controlled by the corporation. 2) Malware to capture the key is all that is required. 3) Law enforcement is capable of producing malware competently and legally forcing it onto machines. 4) The corporation can be legally compelled to install said malware via an automatic update [thereby disabling and/or capturing the key]. If that isn&#x27;t an option, there are various other methods [such as taking the person into custody, installing the malware manually, then releasing them].<p>A couple of ways in which encryption can be circumvented (malware, two delivery methods)<p>You:\n> This is absurd.<p>At no point did I say it was &quot;trivial&quot;. You&#x27;ve resorted to misrepresentations, putting word in mouth, etc. to argue with me.<p>The fact you are going to such lengths to argue against an obvious and accurate analogy [in the majority opinion, since I&#x27;m being upvoted while you are downvoted] is absurd.<p>You:\n> If I understand you right you just want some additional steps for law enforcement to go through<p>At no point did I say that. What I have said this whole time is &quot;Same steps as serving a physical warrant? Well, same for technology.&quot;<p><i>Get Warrant from Judge -> Serve Warrant [Force Entry if required] -> Find Evidence.</i><p>That is how physical warrants are handled and it is how digital warrants should be handled. That is how it works for computers too, fyi. Like desktops with full disk encryption.<p>Is it clear enough now?",1411776471

I&#x27;ve dealt with codebases with such a horrendous build process that it doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of sugar you sprinkle on top because making any change is practically impossible. That complexity has to live somewhere and if you offload it to the docker buildfile it&#x27;s still in the buildfile. The problem at the end of the day comes down to the fact that most developers either don&#x27;t understand enough to build proper build pipelines or they are lazy or they don&#x27;t think complexity in the build pipeline is anything to worry about.

8375535,comment,8374061,8374061,3,0,slashnull,,,"A few hopefully relevant thoughts about translating docs<p>1) translating a piece of english UI will almost double the length of it. That&#x27;s annoying.<p>2) documentation is hard to write and to maintain, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to read and use documentation. Creating multilingual documentation is even harder, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to have an entire coverage of the docs in all languages, which leads to incomplete or outdated/incorrect documentation - which, as the saying goes, is worse than none. Multilingual software inevitably makes the documentation situation of a software worse. Trying to apply language A docs to a language B interface is hell.<p>3) documentation alone isn&#x27;t part of the story; forum threads, answered support questions and that kind of discussion-style paradocumentation is ranges in importance from helpful to just full-on essential and that kind of stuff is never <i>really</i> translated. Trying to get help from a mostly english community for a software translated is hell.<p>4) The sublanguage used in a given UI isn&#x27;t written in a given tongue; really, it&#x27;s written in a pidgin made of the original language of the application <i>plus</i> the slang of the domain of the application, which is usually tied to one, say, culture or spoken language in particular; very large software also typically creates its own sub-language, which separates itself from actual tongue the UI could say to have been written in. After all, any description of a what a software does, expressed in a language evolved for the interaction of human beings in the real, material world, <i>must</i> be a vague and fragile metaphor. Translating metaphors is nearly impossible. It&#x27;s hell. It&#x27;s poetry, but when poetry is not the goal, it&#x27;s hell.<p>That also means that to read the documentation and UI of an application amounts to learning the sublanguage of that application, which as I explained is different from the actual human language it was written in. I can understand that &quot;save&quot; means &quot;serialize the relevant subset of the application state to a file&quot; without knowing anything about the &quot;dictionary&quot; meaning of the English word &quot;save&quot;. It&#x27;s not the same thing. &quot;Save&quot; could be replaced by &quot;blub&quot; as far as I&#x27;m concerned, but it&#x27;s convenient for people who speak english to associate &quot;serialize&quot; to the concept of preserving, of keeping. But it&#x27;s not as important as the consistency of the language developed to describe the concepts and operations of that application. A single &quot;blub&quot; is better than &quot;Save&quot; <i>and</i> &quot;Sauvegarder&quot;. Duplicating the pidgin a software develops for itself makes using that software a special kind of hell.<p>Conclusion: it&#x27;s easy to end up in situations where I have to use french software here in Quebec. Most of my friends have laptops and phones with french UIs. It makes using them a pain in the ass.<p>I absolutely, deeply despise translated UIs; translating a UI is almost systematically a counter-productive activity. It&#x27;s hell.",1411776294

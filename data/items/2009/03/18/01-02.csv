The biggest problem is that 'always-rising value' part - that was a complete myth, at least at the pace that was being seen and assumed would continue.<p>Businesses probably are fundamentally riskier, but there's probably a power distribution in there somewhere, where a few pay off like mad and offset everything else.  I'm not advocating irresponsibly handing out business loans or anything like that, but if a bank has the choice between investing in a risky mortgage or a risky business, I guess I would hope they'd pick the business.  Then again, I'm not really interested in buying a house anytime soon.",1237341427

Any metal exposed to mercury (by a passenger) is likely going to weaken in a radial fashion from point of contact, which means in a pressurized cabin, it shouldn't take long before the air pressure ruptures the leak and the plane would be forced to land due to depressuring.<p>I doubt this would do serious harm to a plane before landing.

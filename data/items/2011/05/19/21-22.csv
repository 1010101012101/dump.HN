Using the oldest I.P.O. trick in the book, the underwriters only issued 7.84 million shares, thereby creating an artificial shortage. Even at $90 each, the value of LinkedIns publicly issued stock is just $706 million. The $8-9 billion figure comes from taking the market price and applying it to the rest of the companys common shares, more than eighty million of them which havent been issued yet. It may well be several years before all of these shares are trading on the open market. At that point, we will have a better idea of what LinkedIn is really worth.""<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2011/05/linkedin-ipo-party-like-its-1999.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2011/05/li...</a>",1305841931

2565493,comment,2563504,2564667,3,0,Shorel,,,"Actually you do want to slam on two pedals, let me explain:<p>You slam the clutch pedal with the left foot, and the brake pedal with the right foot. While the clutch is pressed, you shift to neutral.<p>Depending on the speed, you can make the wheels stop rotating while the car is still moving, something that damages the tire. ABS brakes mitigate the risk of this happening.<p>So the correct technique involves that the strength applied to the brake pedal is more or less proportional to the speed, braking very lightly when the speed is low. This will make the car slow very quickly, in an emergency situation.<p>Other possibility is when negotiating a corner where you know you don't need to shift speeds. Therefore you can brake a little with the left foot while having the right foot on the throttle and simply accelerating on the corner exit.<p>This is in contrast with heel toe down-shifting, where you need to use the left foot to control the clutch pedal, and the right foot to control BOTH brake and throttle pedals.<p>Finally, the nice thing is that you could be doing all three techniques in a single lap in a track.<p>Edit: linky <a href=""http://flyingpigpedia.wetpaint.com/page/Driving+Techniques"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flyingpigpedia.wetpaint.com/page/Driving+Techniques</a>",1305841746

A ""lifestyle business"" is when you can support yourself cashing AdSense checks and paying your server bills and you don't have the bother of managing people.<p>There's something to say for work/life balance,  but personally I don't like working for job shops -- and for me specialization around a particular client-side technology is also a red flag.<p>My experience with places like that is often you have to explain to client B why their project is late,  and often the real answer is ""I was working on a project for client A.""  Client B never wants to hear this,  and if you tell the truth you might lose the client and you'll certainly get in trouble with your boss.  The safest thing to say to the client is nothing,  but then they get antsy and they start to wonder if your company hired a dumbass who can't code his way out of a paper bag.<p>At some point I joined the project management institute and signed on to a code of ethics that explicitly forbids this kind of stupidity.<p>Job shops have other project management problems too.  If you're good you can probably do 4 out of 5 fixed price projects successfully,  but in about 1 out of 5 you've got a customer who can't accept that changes in the spec imply changes in the budget.  Hypothetically you could negotiate these guys into a win-win situation,  but it doesn't work this way in real life because you can burn up endless hours from your most expensive people just communicating with your client.  1 out of 5 projects going this way can eat up the profit you make from the other 4 and then some.<p>Another issue is that job shops are often an unstable business.  One of the more prominent job shops in my town started making web sites in 1994 and fluctuated between 2 and 25 employees before finally going under in 2008.  Funny,  they didn't get hurt by the .bust,  but rather by fluctuations in the local market.  They came to an end largely because some other people started a better job shop that took away their high-end work and a whole bunch of people were doing very cheap work they couldn't compete with on the low end.",1305839158
2565391,comment,2563732,2564687,1,0,Joakal,,,"How about using ""password"" as a password if security is so good? Or do you suggest people keep track of 255 UTF-8 characters for a password?<p>An attacker would still need to go through all 65k ports. I would assume by even false scanning 5 ports, the attacker gets immediately null-routed and still get no response. I would also hope such programs have a paranoid sense of security that they would deny user/password if either are false by not even providing a response as if the program didn't exist.<p>Due to lack of feedback, users will get inconvenience and confusion why ssh doesn't work. Much like passwords example, there's a trade off between usability vs security with varying obscurity levels.",1305839063

Many SSD controllers and/or firmware lack reliability, and crash under heavy load (the drive disappears, then comes back after a power-cycle); some corrupt data randomly; and even sticking to well known and reputable brand and model (think Intel X25) isn't completely safe - on a large bunch some inexplicably fail after only a short while.<p>I think that SSDs are great, but aren't yet as reliable as spinning rust, the standard deviation being really high.<p>For now I heavily ""burn"" SSDs before putting them in production, and use them in RAID only.<p>However of all the pains SSDs give me, I never had an unrecoverable read error so far, even on 3 years old 16GB M-TRON SSDs.",1305838942

Fibre Channel, 10Gig Ethernet) to laptops, tablets, all-in-ones, etc.<p>These probably aren't completely mainstream needs (is USB3 even a mainstream need though?) but they represent things that can only be done with traditional form factor PCs now.

1079013,comment,1078102,1078786,0,0,mock,,,"I don't think we really disagree all that much.  I think the problem is really that content publishers have been dishonest about what they're selling.  When I ""buy"" a DVD what have I actually bought?  What does my mom think I've bought?  This difference is I think what fuels the gasps of shock and horror at the size of the damages when it inevitably goes to court.  The rental car on the other hand, isn't sold as a bait-and-switch.<p>Where we differ however, is that I don't see attempting to coercively redefine the contract as any less legitimate.  If the law is an ass, especially if the law is an ass and has been completely captured by moneyed interests, then disobeying the law en masse until the weight of numbers brings the law into disrepute seems far more likely to push change (at least in this case) than passively boycotting.<p>(FWIW I also believe in jury nullification, which should give you an idea where I stand in the push and pull of rule-of-law vs will-of-the-people)<p>By using technology to put the power to coercively redefine the contract in the hands of the people, the content controller/producers are put in a squeeze.  People don't have to pay them any more (which hits them in the wallet) - to fight that they will have to spend ever increasing amounts of money to buy laws and DRM technology.  As they do so they will increasingly damage the economic and legal systems they depend upon by becoming ever more draconian, causing ever more collateral damage, with predictable consequences.  It seems to me like a case of classic asymmetric warfare, and why they'll lose (or end up so changed from the fight that they'll wish they had).",1264543155

Equally clearly, the stereotype I describe can not be blindly applied. ""Whizzes"" is not extraneous either. Many 20-year-olds are perfectly competent and may be slower or less experienced but don't suffer from this pattern.<p>However, as impressed as you may be by people with three years of experience, it's still not ten years of experience. (Or twenty.)<p>May I also point out that you casually assume the other side of the stereotype: 'All of your experience becomes a hindrance when you start to follow your old steps to the ""right solution"" every time.' That's total bullshit. If you are getting ""real"" experience, the ""good"" experience (which I scarequote mostly because I don't want to go deep into trying to define them but it really ought to be obvious if you think about it), then experience itself tells you when your old experience needs to be augmented.<p>And what disruption are you talking about? I bet in your head you're thinking <i>app</i> disruption; ""old fogies"" can't come up with the idea for Facebook or something. In <i>programming</i> terms, the disruption is <i>way</i> slower than it appears. When I was 20, I got into Python. Python is <i>still</i> working on penetrating the mainstream. Now I'm getting into Haskell, and if it ever goes mainstream (probably not, but if...) it'll be another 5 years minimum. Programming ""disruption"" really doesn't move that fast.<p>(For all the sound and fury of Clojure and Scala and Python and Perl and Ruby and so on and so on, huge amounts of the cognitive traffic are just ""An ORM for X!"" ""A jpeg library for X!"" ""A JSON library for X!"" Patterned, shall we say. True disruption happens way less often.)<p>Besides... I'd point out that none of what you cite actually disproves my point. Everything you cite involves situations where they were probably either vetted by other people higher up, <i>or</i> still trading on quality to produce results quickly that are still a net technical value loss, as open source does not intrinsically prevent that. Open source even has some well-known common failure cases on that front, like ""preference explosion"", using adding preferences to prevent having to make design decisions or telling someone to shove off.<p>You complain as if I'm personally attacking you. I'm not. I'm attacking the stereotype, which definitely exists. And I personally have gotten to the point that someone introduces somebody as a ""whiz"", I mentally cringe.

Some geeks -- like me, and, it sounds like, you -- teach themselves how to do it, but this is still a trait which comes more naturally to most people. This, combined with the geek's active ""inner world"", causes awkward conversations and social behavior.<p>Above average numeracy and a tendency to mentally model problems and situations visually are a couple of other indicators, as well as tendencies towards emotional irregularities.<p>While you might be able to <i>act</i> as though the differences between you and others is not great, the fact is, their brain probably doesn't work very much like yours does.<p>I knew someone for a while that was working on his thesis in psychology; according to him, the field of psychology had a certain reluctance to measure various disorders in degrees. Although psychologists might say, ""this person is autistic, and can function somewhat in society"", and, ""this other person is autistic and cannot function in society"", they're reluctant to say, ""this person is only a little autistic"". (This was the subject of his thesis.)<p>Based on what I've read in the DSM and publications like SciAm:Mind, as well as what I've observed of people, I'd tend to agree with him, and I'd say that it's a pretty safe bet that the majority of stereotypical geeks are ""a little autistic"".",1264541625

There are no good transit routes because everyone is living in cul-de-sac neighborhoods a half-mile from one another. There's no mixed-use zoning, so home, work, food, entertainment -- essentially <i>everything</i> -- is miles away from everything else.  Thus the routes are intractable to build gradually and a critical mass of ridership disinterested until you have effectively a <i>complete</i> network on offer.<p>Most US cities simply can't afford to run a money-losing transit system for two or three years.

It says that there are problems that are so difficult or large that they can only be solved with some of the unique features Lisp, such as macros. Of course, all programming languages in use are Turing-complete, so technically you could use any language. In practice, however, the mental capacities of the programmers form a barrier: imagine writing an OS in Brainfuck.

1070196,comment,1069906,1069906,0,0,natrius,,,"Separate the functions of providing mass transit service and providing mobility for those who can't afford it on their own. There is no need to subsidize mass transit beyond the value of the congestion, pollution, and any other externalities it reduces. Cincinnati does this to an extent through Everybody Rides Metro[1]. A similar concept is facing a lot more resistance in Austin[2].<p>Another necessary policy shift is ceasing to discourage transit-supportive density. Most American cities have wide swathes of land zoned for single-family housing. If everyone is <i>forced</i> to spread out by their government, it will be harder to provide high quality mass transit. This is even worse when you have neighborhoods full of culs-de-sac, which I think should be outlawed, or at the very least they shouldn't be maintained with public funds as they are effectively private driveways that make the street network function more poorly.<p>Cities also often tax density by requiring large developments to provide a certain amount of funds for affordable housing. Dense developments make housing more affordable in the areas where people want to live by supplying more of it without a commensurate effect on demand. Single-family housing rarely has the same requirements. We shouldn't be taxing the things that make our transit systems work better and provide more affordable housing than the alternatives. Most zoning should be abolished.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.everybodyridesmetro.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.everybodyridesmetro.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:940810"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:...</a>",1264182772

1070190,comment,1069808,1069894,0,0,jedbrown,,,"I agree with many of your sentiments.  Here is a view from ""inside"" (I do PDE solvers from a mathematics and computational physics perspective, have written open-source models, and contribute to a popular open-source solver library).<p>1. Very little of numerical analysis is about propagation of rounding errors.  I think you underestimate the reliability of floating point numbers in this context.  The challenge of numerical analysis is not in representing the continuous one-dimensional object (real numbers), but in representing an infinite dimensional space in finite dimensions.  You might appreciate Trefethen's ""The definition of numerical analysis"" (<a href=""http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/nick.trefethen/publication/PDF/1992_55.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/nick.trefethen/publication/PDF/19...</a>).<p>2. We can prove convergence of iterative methods for some problems of practical interest.  More frequently, we can prove that if the iterative method converges, then it converges to a meaningful solution.  Such results are unavailable for some systems, and this is where we enter the domain of Verification (the code converges to exact continuum solutions at the appropriate rate) and Validation (the continuum equations approximate reality).  V&V is a rapidly growing field which offers a number of mature tools, but is still under-appreciated in many disciplines.  The fact that V&V is rarely taught at university, even to applied mathematics graduate students, let alone physicists, doesn't help.<p>3. It takes effort to turn a one-off code that only runs in your special environment into portable, distributable software. Funding agencies and institutions place little emphasis on this process, so it is regularly neglected.  It is exacerbated by the fact that few physicists have any background or interest in software engineering, thus making it more challenging to release non-broken software.",1264182605

1070183,comment,1069808,1069894,0,0,lutorm,,,"I certainly agree with you that there is a lot of publication of results generated with computers that is non-reproducible. However, I'm not sure publishing the complete codes that were used is necessary, as long as there is a detailed description of the algorithm used. In essence, I think it's essential that multiple people write their own codes and reproduce the result. The danger in publishing your code is that it is easier for someone to ""reproduce"" your study by just taking my code and running it, and there is a danger in having the community rely on a small number of codes.<p>The PYTHIA example someone posted is a good one: It's my understanding that basically everyone in high-energy physics uses it, and while that means it gets a lot of testing I'm not sure that many actually bother to look through the code in detail, because ""it's what everybody uses, so if it had a bug it would have been found already"".<p>The situation is similar, but not quite as bad, in astrophysical hydrodynamics simulations. Basically the entire field uses 6 different codes, but they do work on different principles, and the teams do conduct controlled tests of the agreement between them on specific problems.<p>About the chaos problem, I suspect that the problem is worse. My impression is that often there is not even a basic test that the results are numerically converged, regardless of esoteric strange attractors.<p>I'm curious, can you mention any specific cases that you are worried about wrt the chaotic behavior.",1264182530
1070182,comment,1069808,1069894,0,0,Retric,,,"<i>In information theory terms, a simulation can not contain more information that the sum total of the input data and the content of the simulation algorithm.</i><p>This is false outside of the most trivial definition, when you simulate evolutionary systems you can create systems far more complex than the algorithm used to generate them, the problem domain, or any other factor prior to running the simulation.  That information is crated from your random input stream which does not contain information in the classical definition.<p>PS: As to the larger context of the discussion.  From a simulation standpoint sending other scientist the code and having them run it is a bad idea. Reproducibility does not involve the lab that made the discovery sending the devices used to make the discovery to another lab.   The goal is for someone to be able to see the same effect with the most independent setup possible.  If scientist A says ""building this a model with these assumptions > this result.""  Then another lab creates their own software which runs and finds either the same or a different result.  Or, they can look at the assumptions or inputs and say this is bad data try again.  Or, they can look at the code and say, here is a bug fix it and try again.  But, those are three independent steps best carried out by diffrent groups.",1264182422

And even once I did figure it out, it took days before I could truly digest what made that design work.<p>A couple of years later on the Perl 5 core mailing list I responded to a claim that a good Perl programmer could support any well-written Perl program with a key line from that program.  From the volume of the squawks I got, a collection of good Perl programmers generally were not prepared to understand that code, despite years of experience in a language that fully supported closures.<p>I will not claim that it is impossible to imagine effective closures.  I know there are people who are far more intelligent than me, who think very differently than I do.  If history played out again a few times, perhaps it would play out differently.<p>But I say without false modesty that I'm a significantly above average programmer, and I am convinced that I personally could not have come up with effective closures on my own.

A subway line might cost a few billion, but reorganizing a major urban area to be walkable takes decades.<p>Part of it is that most American cities are very new in comparison to their European and Asian counterparts.<p>London, Paris, Barcelona, Tokyo, Kyoto, Seoul, etc. all have Ancient, Roman and/or Medieval cores which by default are designed for walk-ability. The modern cities are by and large extensions of those cores. The only American cities that have similar levels of walk-ability are ones that were founded and largely settled before the car like New York, Philadelphia, D.C. -- basically mid and north atlantic cities. Otherwise you simply can't walk by design.<p>Fixing that requires essentially rebuilding an entire city, which really isn't going to happen anytime soon.

I donated money to help them.  Then I started to wonder what was going on there.  Then for me the clincher was listening to Sam Ruby's presentation at OSCON a few years ago about his experience in trying to get Python running.  From then on I've regarded Parrot as a fun project for those involved which I won't take seriously.  Since then they've cleaned up development, they are making progress towards a far less ambitious Perl 6 than they set out to create, and I wish them well.  But I personally doubt it will ever become widely used as a production platform, and I guarantee that it will never be widely viewed as the prime platform for running a wide variety of dynamic languages.  If for no other reason than the fact that they don't have the people and resources to match what is being done on other platforms.  (Have you paid attention to what Google has done for JavaScript execution?)<p>Just consider the facts.  Python is a well defined target with multiple ports to different virtual machines.  It is basically a perfect example of a realistically complex language in wide use.  If you look at his background (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Ruby</a>), Sam Ruby is pretty much the ideal person to work on a cross-language virtual machine.  There has been literally no person that I've heard of in the Parrot project before or since who has as much relevant experience.  And he failed.<p>The reasons why he failed are complex.  But the biggest were all related to specific people problems (luckily mostly fixed since), and a design myopia that believes that Perl 6 subsumes all other dynamic languages, and therefore internal conventions that support Perl 6 efficiently will support everything else well (emphatically not true).  Half those problems are gone.  The people issues have improved, the design myopia has not.<p>Wake me up when they get serious about supporting Python.  Until then any claims of ""all dynamic languages"" should come with huge disclaimers.",1264181205

I deal on a daily basis with datasets that are several GB in size, and don't regard them as especially large.  If I wanted to find a loop in a linked list, I'd worry about allocating memory to a subsidiary data structure that was subsequently going to be thrown away.  Given that I often don't know the size of the data set, I can't easily create a hash structure, so having a wide selection of algorithms like this immediately to hand gives me a good chance of finding something that will work.<p>My first application of this technique was in an implementation of a variation on the Pollard Rho method of factoring.  In that case it's impossible to create a parallel data structure - the teleporting turtle-type of technique is essential.<p><pre><code>  > my inclination is to go for either the hash table\n  > or search tree solution unless I really, really\n  > have to implement some special algorithm.\n</code></pre>\nIt seems to me that in most of the cases you're considering you wouldn't have a linked list to start with.  I get the feeling that the situations where one would seriously consider using a linked list as opposed to a hash table or tree search are those situations where you do have to worry about these issues.<p>As usual the answer is really to question why there's a linked list to start with.<p><pre><code>  > How would you ever not know the start state\n  > of the mark on each node? It's a field you\n  > invented, ...\n</code></pre>\nAgain, not always the case.  I regularly deal with libraries and I'm given an API, but I don't get to define the fields.  This happened to me recently where I had a complex data structure and I wanted a flag on each node, but couldn't have it.  The solution we thought of first built a subsidiary data structure to keep the additional information, but that destroyed the performance.  In the end we used a trick like the teleporting turtle, that reminded me of Floyd's algorithm, and so I wrote it up.",1264180831

Learning the language does not cause the thoughts, but you cannot think through the thoughts effectively until you've developed a language that can express them.<p>Of course once you have learned to think those thoughts then you can figure out how to do those things in languages that don't have closures.<p>This raises, obviously, the question of how the idea of closures was ever first established.  And the answer to that is kind of interesting.  The history as I understand it is that they were invented by accident as a side effect of other decisions in ALGOL and Pascal.  But weren't extensively used there.  Then Sussman noticed that they worked extremely well when combined with the idea of functions as data that was already popular in Lisp, and co-wrote Scheme, the first Lisp with closures.  The adoption of closures in other variants of Lisp was usually quick (eLisp stands out as a glaring exception).  From there they got carried to other languages.  The adoption of closures in scripting languages, particularly JavaScript, brought them to a much wider audience, and now they are becoming pretty mainstream.<p>So nobody really thought up the first programming techniques involving closures from scratch.  Instead those techniques were invented in a bad form using other forms of scope, then closures were noticed as a solution for the shortcomings of those scoping problems and things cascaded from there.",1264180299

1070032,comment,1069808,1069894,0,0,mattheww,,,"Your concerns are certainly legitimate, and I'm sure there are some situations where they apply. However, in many physical sciences (I would venture to say the vast majority), simulations are not chaotic. They are based on stochastic models that have converging behavior. So, in general, it really is fair for most people to rely on the stability of the simulations.<p>As for your other points, the issue of simulation accuracy is already taken very seriously in the areas where I've seen it used.<p>Let me give an example from my field (high energy physics). The pre-eminent event generator of choice is called PYTHIA. It incorporates as much known physics as possible, and is continually updated. There are groups that regularly convene to compare the distributions it produces to those seen in real experiments and adjust the parameters to improve the results. The code is open source, so you can readily make improvements and submit them to the maintainers for inclusion in official releases.<p>Now the primary uses of these simulations are to either tune your analysis to separate signal from background or calculate corrections for different kinds of detector acceptance issues. No reviewer would ever accept a publication that used simulation if the paper did not include clear evidence that the simulation was valid, usually in the form of a data/simulation comparison.<p>Regarding reproducabilility, I think you're a little off the mark. The idea is not that you should simply repeat my analysis to get the same answer (this important verification step should be, and usually is, present in all scientific groups). Ideally, you should collect your own data, make your own simulations, and do your own analysis. Then we should see if we got the same answer.<p>Edit: grammar",1264180189

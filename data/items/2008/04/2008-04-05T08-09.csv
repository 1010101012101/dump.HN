( <a href=""http://manageengine.adventnet.com/products/support-center"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manageengine.adventnet.com/products/support-center</a> ) .

Too often he's thought of as a proto-Nazi, and maybe he is, at least in terms of attitude. But every reading lends to the belief that above all else he's an endlessly untapped pool of thought.<p>2. Debussy. I'm increasingly convinced that he is Beethoven/Bach/Mozart's superior. Each among the latter wrote endless meadering or cliche'd passages. Debussy produced consisent note-by-note perfection, combined with experimentation. He, however, has no ""great works"". They all stand about the same, even <i>La Mer</i>.<p>3. Rachmaninov. Reached some of the greatest possible heights, though he is full of mistakes and lapses. The Paganinni variations sits on a pedestal along with the 9th, Brahms' requiem, and Bach's Bm mass.<p>4. Chopin. A composer of limited scope and a laughable arranger, still has the incomparable distinction of writing the world's greatest melody, in the E flat major etude. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-idMTyc0AY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-idMTyc0AY</a><p>5. Rochefoucauld. The perfect man.",1207383020

155562,comment,154692,154994,0,0,jrockway,,,"In real MVC, you want to put everything related to your business rules, storage access, etc. in your model.  Then you wrap the View and Controller around that as a very thin web <-> model glue.  That's all a web framework should do, web-enable your model classes.  Things that should not happen in the Controller include touching the ORM (or SQL queries), validating input, any business logic, etc.  Just pass the request to the right model, see if the model did what you asked, and display the success page or the error page.<p>Here's a short talk I wrote on the subject:<p><a href=""http://www.jrock.us/fp2008/catalyst/start.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jrock.us/fp2008/catalyst/start.html</a>",1207382534

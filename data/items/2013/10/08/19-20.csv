6517430,comment,6516948,6516948,129,0,saurik,,,"Amazon already offered the login feature (this was launched earlier this year), and they already offered an API-based payments platform (Amazon Flexible Payments, launched in 2008). Rather than just allow you to pass login tokens to Flexible Payments, however, they have decided to provide a completely incompatible API with a new set of endpoints, a completely incompatible accounting system, and even completely new terminology to describe the same set of steps. As someone who has invested heavily in Amazon Payments solution over the last four and a half years (for a long time I had been their largest customer doing mobile payments, and when jailbreaks come around I still leap upward in their charts), I frankly look at this as a massive &quot;fuck you&quot;, and not any kind of reasonable step forward :(.<p>Seriously: integrating payment processing is never the hard part; instead, it is integrating all of the accounting backends from different providers so you have all of the charges, fees, fines, refunds, disputes, etc. all being calculated and scraped in a way such that despite processing millions of transactions you are in a position to, for example, file things like VAT and income tax. It can take months of experience to figure out &quot;oh, this API is failing to correlate chargebacks in these specific circumstances, but I can work around the issue like this&quot; or to learn what all the different kinds of error messages that a user can end up seeing so you can provide support. It might even be worth it  occasionally to rewrite everything if the new services always provided a superset of the functionality from the old ones and there was some kind of migration path, but Amazon just keeps making entirely unrelated solutions.<p>After the way Amazon has treated their FPS platform (they seem incapable of making even trivial changes: even just fixing wording in e-mails that they agree is flawed and confusing to users), I cannot imagine ever investing in another Amazon Payments product again (and I have tons of more reasons why I&#x27;ve come to this position, which I&#x27;m probably going to be putting together into a blog post soon, largely having to do with the lack of any reasonable payment fraud prevention model for third-party products). I honestly get the impression that they outsource all of their development for Amazon Payments and no longer have any expertise in-house required to actually maintain the software once deployed. (If nothing else, from having the opportunity to speak with a couple Payments developers working out of Amazon&#x27;s India offices, I know that they are not running development for these products out of Seattle; the time zone differences might just be horribly brutal attempting to coordinate?)<p>To be clear: I tried very hard to work with them, having tons of meetings with greater and greater numbers of people on their side, putting together more and more detailed descriptions of what is going wrong on their end (even teaching them some things about payment fraud, which simply should not happen: I should not ever have anything insightful to say about payment fraud that they haven&#x27;t already spent years thinking about... I&#x27;m just a tiny merchant, whereas they are either one of the world&#x27;s largest merchants or a payment processing firm depending on which angle you are looking at them from ;P), before finally giving up a few months ago (I&#x27;ve just resolved to remove them entirely from my stack and replace them with more reasonable solutions).<p>Somehow PayPal manages, every few months, to provide interesting new functionality--even provide entirely new API layers--and it all maps back to the same accounting backends, old code continues to work with minimal changes, and the UI keeps improving (slowly, but surely). Amazon FPS in 2008 far surpassed similar offerings, but in the last five years PayPal simply built up the same functionality (better) while Amazon let theirs rot. It isn&#x27;t even clear how this new Login and Pay with Amazon service is connected with Amazon Payments: they mention a random subset of the now-numerous Amazon payments-related products in the documentation as being incompatible with this (including Checkout by Amazon), but they don&#x27;t even bother to mention a whole host of others (including Flexible Payments and Simple Pay). I&#x27;ve found an older version of the documentation (using Google Cache) that references Amazon Payments Advanced (another Amazon Payments offering that seemed targeted, ironically, at less advanced use cases), but the new integration guide limits the scope to just payments made via this service. They seriously have so many incompatible solutions now that it doesn&#x27;t even seem worthwhile attempting to document how they relate :(.",1381262354

It shouldn&#x27;t be made easy to dismiss an alarm.<p>At first, it seems like an awesome feature when you know the source of fire. e.g your kitchen.<p>But consider CO alarm cases. Top 10 reviews in Amazon for a Smoke alarm + CO detector talk about how CO alarm saved their lives. Most of the reviewers at first thought it was a false alarm. If it was Nest they would have &quot;easily&quot; dismissed it and probably died.<p>But that said, other features like motion detector, night light, syncing with Nest thermostat to shutoff the heater, cool design, make it a good buy.

The issue I believe is that enough of us in our home have experienced enough false alarms that basically give us a &#x27;boy who cried wolf&#x27; mentality when it comes down to it. Few of us will risk staying in a building when the alarm goes off, even if it is a drill, because false alarms in those systems seem seldom.<p>Thus, the ability to handle a false alarm gracefully is much better than having to disable the alarm in a permanent fashion for a temporary situation or struggle with containing a smoking meal until the irritation is over.<p>As far as analogies goes, If ambulance sirens were used by their operators to beat traffic for say...a sandwich and we all knew, it, we probably would ignore it much like China, for example, does. But because the belief is that the siren is turned on only for explicit emergencies, we pay attention to it.<p>Minefields is also a poor analogy. A more accurate one would be a mine detector. If a mine detector would give off a false alarm every time it came across a stick, people would fail to heed its warning in a real situation. They in effect would learn to ignore it and then that one time they did go in a minefield they&#x27;d be blown to bits.<p>Furthermore, The vast majority of ambulance sirens heard are for emergencies, and the vast majority of people who&#x27;ve ignored a minefield or it&#x27;s detectors have probably died stepping on an ignored mine. I&#x27;m guessing the many smoke alarms going off have been for false positives, if they weren&#x27;t, we wouldn&#x27;t be having this discussion which it seems everyone hear has experienced or knows someone who has.",1381260939

Dude, your knees hurt because you don&#x27;t squat!<p>This is not strictly true. What works for you does not necessarily work for others, and hassling them for not doing something that hurts them isn&#x27;t going to help.<p>I&#x27;ve been lifting for almost three years (started Dec 2010). I have very good form which I learned from a friend who was very experienced in lifting (and corroborated by several trainers and random dudes at the gym saying &quot;wow, nice form!&quot;). Before I started lifting I had been running for about 10 years (started running in middle school, didn&#x27;t start lifting until after college). Everything was going great. Lifting three days a week, running another three days a week, and resting completely one day.<p>Then one day I took a weird step while running and my right knee started hurting. It&#x27;s never stopped hurting. Two X-Rays, an MRI, two physical therapists later and they don&#x27;t have any idea why I&#x27;m in constant pain (literally constant pain, I&#x27;m constantly aware of my knee hurting). I still lift, still with good form, still moving lots of weight around, but my knee still hurts. I can&#x27;t run anymore, though, as that aggravates the injury.<p>And before you say it, I hurt my knee after I had been running in vibrams for three years. I was running 6-7 miles 3x a week in vibrams and all it took was one weird step to totally ruin that.<p>After the injury, on a PT&#x27;s advice, I tried switching back to &quot;normal&quot; running shoes. They didn&#x27;t help at all. I played around with my gait, trying to run with a wider stance since they were guessing my narrow gait was putting stress on the bad point in my knee; that didn&#x27;t help. Stretching doesn&#x27;t help, drugs don&#x27;t really help (the most effective drug so far is Aleve). Lifting seems to have no effect on my knee. I tried not lifting or running for three months and my knee still hurt. I picked lifting back up and it made no difference to my pain levels.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m just trying to say that we all have different physical ailments that cannot necessarily be solved by general advice. Maybe your friends&#x27; knees hurt because there&#x27;s something wrong with them and lifting will make it worse.",1381259144

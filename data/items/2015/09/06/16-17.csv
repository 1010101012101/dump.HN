For our final project we are creating our own song recommendation algorithm.  Users on our app can sign up and sync their Spotify playlists to begin generating playlists based on our algorithm.  We are still working on the site (some parts don&#x27;t look/work the way they should), but for the purposes of testing the algorithm we need a lot of users to sign up and sync their playlists.  Does not matter if you have a premium Spotify account or a free one.  Once a user signs up they will be asked to sync their playlist immediately.  The whole process should only take a minute or two.  So, if you&#x27;ve got a moment, please head to the url, sign up, sync, and be forever appreciated!!<p>moneyteam.servebeer.com",1441558710

Bring snacks.\n5. Depending on how much you fly and if you have elite status, go for the upgrade if you are able. \n6.

BitCoin seem to be able to solve it since they can do internal clearing and consolidation on top of the blockchain without having to accumulate debt.<p>How much of it will translate to the end user&#x27;s transactions probably not much at first, the blockchain might also have other issues that cannot be currently foreseen or understood that could incur hidden costs, but with how the current BitCoin blockchain works it will not be financially viable for small transactions as it will pollute the blockchain with very low value transactions and delay the big and important ones so you&#x27;ll either have multiple chains or you&#x27;ll have again some sort of system that will accumulate debt which will be settled later in one large transaction which means that you again take on similar risks to current credit card transactions which do not guarantee that the funds are available.<p>As for the costs well you are looking at enormous setup costs, very high operational costs due to needing to manage risk, maintain a very liquid cash flow, insurance, regulation etc, VISA Inc made 12B dollars last year and 30-40% of their income these days come from &quot;Data Processing&quot; and not from fees, if that&#x27;s too much, too little well you decide :P",1441558126

10178114,comment,10175296,10175296,0,0,acjohnson55,,,"Very interesting piece. It sounds a lot like how exceptions be used to implement non-error control flow [1]. The one bone I have to pick is the juxtaposition of PFP and imperative as opposites. Certainly it&#x27;s the case that PFPers can and do implement imperative logic monadically, but it&#x27;s also the case that imperative programmers often use frameworks that largely treat the business logic, where most of the programming is actually done, as more or less pure functions. Moreover, explicitly hybrid languages like JavaScript, Scala, Rust, Swift, etc. seem to be where a lot of the practical PL excitement is these days. I think the real debate is in the best patterns to use for particular generic problems. That&#x27;s the core of the blog post of course, I&#x27;m just disagreeing with some of the rhetorical framing.<p>Anyhow, the premise reminds me a lot of <i>What Color Is Your Function</i> [2] and its critique of async programming. I think monads are super useful and intuitive when representing data. Promises/futures blew my mind, once I finally understood them, but I think there are important points about how they can become extremely cumbersome within a large architecture. I have to admit that I&#x27;m starting to agree that they may be a dead end, no matter how much syntactic sugar you sprinkle on it.<p>I think the big issue is that if you can&#x27;t pull data out of a monad, you can&#x27;t really encapsulate its logic. For containers, this isn&#x27;t much of a problem, because the monadic data structure is either inherent to the data itself or you can fold your way down to something more primitive. In those cases, the monadic model seems completely reasonable and very nicely encapsulated to me. I&#x27;m not sure I buy the idea that scoped continuations should replace this monad usage.<p>Connecting back with async programming, I wonder how this jives with the actor model, which has been so widely praised as a model of concurrency that is conceptually simple, easy to reason about, fault tolerant, and imperative. When the author mentioned the thread being the atom of imperative programming, actors immediately came to mind.<p>Lastly, much like monads, futures and every other abstraction out there, the usefulness of scoped continuations may come down to how easily it can be expressed and comprehended within real programming languages. I found the examples in the original talk and the blog post to both be rather difficult to follow. The former, probably because of the use of = to select the scope and the latter because of the verbosity of Java. It would be interesting to see if there&#x27;s a syntax that really captures the operation in an intuitive way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2742719/how-do-i-break-out-of-a-loop-in-scala"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2742719/how-do-i-break-ou...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-y...</a>",1441557509

This has led to a glut of postdocs, who are underpaid, overworked, and have little hope of ever obtaining a permanent academic position[2]. And even at top universities, industry positions are quite difficult to get without putting time and effort that you don&#x27;t have to spare into extensive networking[3].<p>During his postdoc, Gariépy&#x27;s had one second-author publication in <i>Nature Neuroscience</i>[4], which probably wasn&#x27;t enough to get a tenure-track professorship. If, like the first author on that paper, he had gotten an assistant professorship at a prestigious university[5], he probably wouldn&#x27;t be airing his dirty laundry.

Look at flagella.<p>But there&#x27;s nothing inherent about rotary motion that is impossible for organics to do. It&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; that there is no clear evolutionary path from something that relies on linear actuation to something that relies on rotary actuation.<p>(Also, note that there <i>are</i> pumps that are continuous that don&#x27;t rely on rotary motion. Among other things, you can have two+ sacs, each with an inlet and outlet valve that can contract and expand. One expands while the other contracts, and vice versa. There&#x27;s still some variation while the changeover happens - but this can be avoided if you have >2 sacs. Alternatively, there are peristaltic pumps that work continuously that can be implemented with only linear actuators. (As a bonus, this means that you don&#x27;t need a centralized pump. You can integrate it into the blood vessels themselves.)<p>The bigger limitation tends to be respiratory, actually. Earth has only ~21% oxygen currently. You bump that up (causing all sorts of other problems), you can have faster and/or larger critters. Alternatively, you have more efficient lungs (Note that human-style lungs are relatively inefficient. Ideally you want air to flow in one direction through the lungs instead of alternating... Birds do that, IIRC.) and/or more efficient oxygen / CO2 transport in the blood. Red blood cells are not exactly efficient.

10178074,comment,10177623,10177623,0,0,lorenzhs,,,"I think the article is very quick to dismiss the difference in number of graduates between Germany and the UK (27 vs 48%, was it?). Why do half of young Brits get a University degree, while only a quarter of young Germans do? One part of the answer is of course the German school system, which only permits students who attended a &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (grammar school) to attend university, but that applies to roughly half of all students [1]. Since schools are tiered by academic ability, it would be safe to assume that those wishing to pursue higher education would attend a Gymnasium, so we&#x27;re nearly back to square one.<p>Statistics [1] also show that in Germany 43% started a university education, but only 28% completed one. Meanwhile, UK universities boast with their high retention rates, which might raise the question of how they achieve this without compromising the quality of the degrees. (My experience in the UK was that just about anyone got a degree, and a third (that&#x27;s a grade, not a fraction) is basically worthless)<p>All this, I think, leads to two points. First, a lot of jobs in the UK require a degree, although it is not clear to me why. Secondly, while German universities might not be as present at the very top, the baseline seems to be a lot higher than in the UK (several factors play into this, among them the ability to switch subjects (due to lack of fees and very little social stigma) and not caring about retention rates, i.e. letting bad students fail), which is probably while the German diploma was so highly regarded.<p>(Another major difference I noticed was that in German universities, nobody checks up on you, and you are expected to take responsibility as an adult, whereas in England, it felt like the University was trying to be my Mummy.)<p>Lastly, the omnipresent reminder: foreigners don&#x27;t pay tuition in Germany, either. There is a language barrier, but I probably don&#x27;t need to point out all the articles which were here on HN not so long ago about increasing numbers of US and British students in Germany.<p>[1] <a href=""https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiturientenquote_und_Studienanfängerquote#Studienberechtigte"" rel=""nofollow"">https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiturientenquote_und_Studie...</a>",1441556761

There are publishers out there that will take any material, rubber stamp it, and publish it for very large amounts of money. Just like there are journals that will accept papers on anything - I can&#x27;t tell you how many papers I start to read to realize that all they are doing is reporting on some well known result from 20+ years ago. Publish or perish, I guess.<p>How much does an academic get from one of these (good) books? I find it hard to believe it makes economic sense when you compare amount of labor vs money. I have an (unsigned) book contract sitting in my inbox right now - the money on offer is not a motivating factor, believe me. But, I&#x27;m an engineer, so I&#x27;m envisioning that instead of writing a book you could consult and make 10x to 100x return compared to writing. Probably not many consulting positions available in 15th century Spanish poetry. But I think I could get a better return on time working at McDonalds.<p>Anyway, academics <i>are</i> starting to write open access books. Books that no one can afford to buy, books that are not electronic and hence unsearchable, will be land fill in a few decades. We are awash in information, and this knowledge will be lost forever if we continue locking it up like this.

Fair enough. I still say any book locked on paper is dead, soon (of the type talked about in the article, defining books in the field will be known and accessible). These books get shredded after never being checked out; they aren&#x27;t going to exist in 200 years to be ILL&#x27;ed, or digitized after copyright runs out. Of course exceptions will exist; I&#x27;m talking in the large.<p>edit2: I am not an academic, but I read academic publications every day. Access is much more difficult on this side of the ivory tower. ILL is not easy to get access to. The times I have looked into it you usually see that there are two copies of the book available, and both are checked out and won&#x27;t be available for 3 months (end of semester).

The amazing hack was that the rotational speed of the disk was just right so that during each rotation, the raw bits coming off of each head produced a video signal with just the right frequency for piping out through a coax to a completely dumb black-and-white video screen! (Actually, there was a cross-switch in there, so that there could be 64 of these special screen/keyboard units, of which 32 could be in use at a time; in fact, you could walk up to any of them and &quot;grab&quot; the channel that you had been using from a different office, or, for that matter, peek at anybody else&#x27;s channel.)<p>Anyway, the custom OS (&quot;Waits&quot;) made good use of the Data Disc graphics system: it had a built-in interactive line editor, so that when you were in the shell, you could edit your command line (control-d deletes a character, etc., etc.) and see the result in realtime. (This was years and years before Unix got similar features in tcsh and bash and the readline library). All programs inherited this functionality automatically, so Wait&#x27;s full-screen editor (&quot;E&quot;) was simply built on top of it. (Again, years and years before emacs and vi, and all on a system with a per-process address space of only 256K words (about 1Mb), split evenly between data and code.)<p>So, to finally answer your question: while Knuth did spend his early years programming on punched-card batch systems (where you pretty much had to write out code long-hand before keypunching it), by the time he had started working on TeX he had been exclusively using a full-screen editor on a graphical display for many years.",1441555587

Anti-semitism was so wide spread in Europe and US...<p>For example, story of Kristallnacht and expelling of polish jews to Poland...<p>Nazis expelled majority of Polish jews to Poland in 28 October 1938. However, Poland refused to accept them even though they were Polish citizens. So ~8000 people (families with young children, elders..) ended up stranded in no-mans land without food, shelter, ... (Among those stranded were parents of Herschel Grynszpan, Polish Jews who was living in Paris. He heard and saw suffering of his family and, on Monday, 7 November 1938, he murdered  Ernst vom Rath in Paris. Then Nazis organized Kristallnacht...)<p>And seems story is happening now with refugees from Syria: ISIS is not really interested to have certain people (only &quot;real&quot; Muslims can stay) in their state - so they pretty much expelled bunch of people.

As a public defense attorney, her clients truly are the accused unable to retain private legal services - the indigent. As Ms. Peng argues, the service provided by public defenders is a constitutional right, not to mention one of the fundamental elements in a system designed to provide for adequate and universal representation. That the State issues her salary is a direct result of the constitutionality of the services public defense offices provide, and is the mandated prerogative of the State in due compliance with the Constitution. Ms. Peng has granted us an insider view of what is becoming an increasingly slippery slope. We cannot eschew the <i>rightful</i> defense of any group, no matter how &quot;marginalized,&quot; and presume in the same breath that those criteria will never broaden or change. Nor can we expect legal disenfranchisement, and an inevitable increase in unjust incarceration, to resolve anything.",1441555470

I re-read the architecture a few times then stepped through the source to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing something. I was thinking that maybe the servers were only used to deploy the image processing code to the client which could then run the code locally. But that&#x27;s not the case.<p>Serverless implies that a server is not required after an installation step and that you only need your local device. Or perhaps too that you only need a collection of like clients to do something P2P.<p>Just because you as the developer don&#x27;t have to think about the server doesn&#x27;t make it serverless.",1441555381

Some things you might consider:<p>* Better explosions.  You can get pretty good effects with expanding/contracting colored circles, or using an animated sprite.  I'm not sure what would be more efficient in html5.  For an example check out the explosions in <a href=""http://mochiland.com/articles/flash-game-friday-death-vs-monstars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mochiland.com/articles/flash-game-friday-death-vs-mon...</a><p>* Reduce the size of the player's collision box.  Most 'bullet hell' shooters actually use a box much smaller than the player sprite to give the player a bit of leeway as they try to dodge bullets.<p>* There's a pretty big size mismatch between the player and the enemies, maybe even that out a bit?  The small enemies are cool because you can have a lot in a wave, but as a player the small enemies felt frustratingly hard to hit sometimes.<p>* Bullet image sprites.  Guessing there's a performance issue here but I thought I'd suggest it anyways just in case you haven't tried it.  A nice bullet sprite will make enemy bullets easier to read and easier for the player to dodge.",1299344372
2291758,comment,2291612,2291612,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Ok.<p>UML does NOT equal CASE. Yes, you can use MDA and other techniques to somehow convert UML and OCL into a quasi-CASE tool, and there are lots of folks excited about UML as part of a code-generation tier, but UML is a specification for drawing technical diagrams. That's it.<p>UML is also not a methodology. Yes, there are methodologies that rely on bits of UML but that's a one-way association. You can use UML all the time and never do a bit of any kind of methodology.<p>UML is also not for large projects. Yes, it helps to diagram things instead of writing them out, especially if you have 100 developers or more. But drawing things can help teams as small as two people. Heck, drawing things can help a sole developer.<p>You need to be clear about the question if you would like to get a meaningful answer. UML is for drawing pictures in a consistent way. So is the question ""Do real developers draw pictures consistently?"" Because in my teams, we use UML when we need to sketch out things so that everybody has some baseline to understand what's being drawn. It has nothing to do with generating code, completing a process, or being part of some huge team.<p>I liked this comment: <i>If a diagram takes more than 5 minutes to sketch on the back of an envelope it is generally too complex</i><p>I might extend it to 15-20 minutes, but the gist here is correct, at least for small teams. Different story entirely with large teams, though. With a large team, having a visual roadmap of where things are and where things go is hell of a lot better than trying to type it up in a Word document or teach people by random story-telling. (It should still be pretty simple, though. The purpose is communication, not documentation or showing people how detailed you can make something)",1299344333

I went through a similar period years ago, slowly discovering that I hated programming, and certainly had no idea it was ubiquitous. I had just started a new company and it was the worst possible time to learn it. Moreso, programming from boyhood (whizkid!) made it sewn up in my identity.  Crisis!<p>Management was an escape for a while.  And luckily it disappeared, like teenage allergies.  Now I can't wait to hack in the mornings.  But at the time, it was devastating.<p>On a related point, all the folks I know who exited programming for other careers, were <i>lesser</i> programmers.  I certainly didn't want to make that self-discovery. :)",1299344081

2291746,comment,2291044,2291455,0,0,gwern,,,"> All we have is history to go on and the fact that new jobs have always replaced old ones.<p>I've always been a little skeptical of this. We all know that the official unemployment rate is a bit misleading as it only counts those actively looking for work, but I suspect historical comparisons show that it's even more misleading than we think.<p>Let's go back to the 1800s, when technology hadn't yet, according to the Luddite hypothesis, put tons of people out of work.<p>Back then, retirement didn't exist. So bam, now we've got one segment of the population who are employed. Schooling went to high school at most and higher education was only a tiny fraction of the population. So there's another large segment of the population employed, all those who would be stuck in school now. Basically everyone who is now in undergraduate or graduate school would have been out working a job.<p>And of course, child labor was legal, so that implies an awful lot of jobs there too. And what about all those people with Downs syndrome or other forms of retardation or mental illness? They were all down on the farm helping with the baling or something. (Just counting the kids in special ed, and not all the adults, there's like 6 million of them: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education_in_the_United_States#Classification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education_in_the_United...</a> )<p>Now surely some of all of that is necessary to keeping a modern economy running rather than an 1800s one. But how much of that is just killing time or keeping people out of the employment market? Thought experiment: if a fairy suddenly granted all the kids and students and retirees an education and credentials to match (all 20 or 50 million or whatever of them), how many years would it take the market to absorb them and match them up with jobs?

2291740,comment,2291612,2291612,0,0,bane,,,"These tools serve two, very useful, purposes that aren't often readily apparent unless you have to use them.<p>1) Organize complexity. UML, for example, is extremely useful as a <i>language</i> capable of describing complex information systems -- just like the periodic table organizes chemical elements or the biological classification taxonomy organizes life -- or perhaps a better analogy are skeletal formulas in chemistry and life sciences.<p>You can probably get away with not using this language on small projects, maybe less than 10 people and under a quarter million lines of code. But on larger projects, 300 developers on one project spread over a continent and tens of millions of lines of code, some kind of formal organizational method becomes a necessity. Ad hoc diagrams just don't really cut it. You'll be glad to know that UML is not just stick figures anymore, some of the other diagrams do a much better job at modeling and organizing deeper into the design than others.<p>But like I said, the utility doesn't really become apparent until you deal with this kind of scale.<p>2) Communication. Similar to the above, but distinct. UML also provides a lingua franca for communications between business people and tech people. It forces business users to apply a rigid logic to their requirements (which can often become contradictory if not controlled by some kind of formal framework) which aids in communicating with engineering staff and forces engineers to stop talking about code and to talk about higher level abstracts that are more easily relatable to business people. The ability to actually communicate between these two parties has been extremely powerful.<p>In smaller organizations, the business people are quite often the tech folks as well so this isn't as necessary to have. But in most traditional companies, business folks have almost no way of communicating with the engineers in any constructive way without something like this.",1299343773

Where I work we do pair programming, so this is really huge, any time we want to switch roles it is just a local commit and pull away.<p>3) no single point of failure. I don't know if this has happened to you before, but if your svn server gets corrupted, basically work completely stops until it is fixed. Reconstructing a recent version of your code base based on whats on dev machines is pretty much asking who was the last one to pull, because again, dev work doesn't mess with master since branching is so easy, so everyone should have a clean version of the mainline on their machines.<p>I think the advantages of DVCS are _way_ more obvious for open source projects, but you can see a lot of benefits using it pretty much anywhere.",1299342232

As one of the other commentators already pointed out, the percentage of YC founders that are women is about equal to the percentage that apply. Saying that the ""data support"" the argument that YC is biased when there is such an obvious alternative explanation (namely, that there are less female founders) is disingenuous.<p>> since YC is a for profit business they are making economically sound decisions.<p>Wait, what?

2291666,comment,2291553,2291553,0,0,rlpb,,,"""Forensic analysis"" as it works today on magnetic hard drives works is heavily based on the principles under which these type of drives operate. They take advantage of the fact that deleting a file does not actually delete a file on disk, as it is more efficient to simply mark those areas as unused. They are taking advantage of an optimisation that has been done for decades.<p>SSDs are completely different. The optimisation no longer works, since flash memory has no overwrite operation, only a block-erase operation (which is a slow operation - and the erase blocks are relatively huge). In order to stay efficient, SSDs <i>must</i>  perform background free space management, which includes erasing unused blocks in advance in order to be ready for new data.<p>This should be obvious to anyone who understands how flash memory works. SSD manufacturers have no option here. It's a fundamental side-effect of the technology.<p>""Forensic analysis"" that depends on an optimisation performed on a system using a hard drive will no longer work with a different technology that cannot use that optimisation. They were exploiting something that is not necessarily going to be possible any more.<p>If they want a clean equivalent of a ""write blocker"", they are going to have to somehow disable the SSD's background management before powering up the drive. This might not help so much though if the background management has already erased unused blocks after the user deleted files.<p>I will accept though that this means that people working in the field will need to change their procedures.<p>Summary: forensic analysis only works because of an optimisation that systems using magnetic hard drives did but systems using SSDs can't.

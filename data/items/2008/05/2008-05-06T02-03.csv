182116,comment,181989,181989,0,0,marketer,,,"This was a great article, from someone who clearly cares about usability and customer satisfaction. Although many of his points are arguable, it really comes down to one thing: choosing the platform.<p>Choosing a platform always has trade-offs, and the flash vs. html is no exception. When you decide on a platform for your application, it almost always means your going to exclude users from accessing it. I.E Windows software is generally not usable in OSX or Linux, and Mozilla extensions are not available from other web browsers.<p>Another thing - people develop levels of comfort with platforms, and switching can be a daunting experience. It's hard for the average Windows user to switch to Linux, because so many basic features of Windows are missing, and the user experience is so different. Same with flash vs. html - things like ctl+f don't work, text highlighting is different, the presentation is not as familiar.<p>Any smart person will consider these platform trade-offs when developing an application. You might lose some users, but I think people appreciate high-quality applications with good UIs. I don't mind waiting a few seconds to see a beautiful flash site to load  (www.schematic.com, for instance).",1210042509

    2) Saving an SWF is not trivial.

    3) How much of your target audience really bothers to find a resource viewer?

    4) It's necessary because your users don't have a resource viewer.

    5) So the flash developer has to know what 'url fragments' are in order to make portions of the app bookmarkable.

    6) I can't think of a flash app where open in new tab works.  Obviously it is not trivial to implement</code></pre>",1210041586

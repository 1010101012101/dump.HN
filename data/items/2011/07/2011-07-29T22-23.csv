2824180,comment,2823009,2823009,2,0,jfdi,,,"Sent a note to my congressman too. Was a first time for me in doing so on any subject.<p>I tried to lighten the EFF verbiage a bit to focus on what I think is the real punchline for me --- Any law mandating the personal data on the activities of its citizens be amassed and centralized, is a problem. Even if this law is only partially achieving this point and it has the best of intentions it seems very plausible or even likely that the data would be misused with possibly devastating consequence. Additionally like so many laws before it, it's likely that incrementally restrictive laws be built atop of it in socially difficult to (but not impossible to) digest pieces until the system is unacceptable all together.<p>Yes personal information is amassed about people who use certain products, like Facebook (by Facebook), but that pool of consumers has a choice in the use of that service and accepting it's terms. If they don't like the terms, they can create a new great service - in turn, fostering the competitive spirit and trending towards more acceptable terms and better choices for all.",1311980333

The coffeeshops that are offering them a $5 coffee don't care if the incoming customer has spent only $1.40 on coffee before today much the same as they don't care whether they bought a new tv yesterday. They just want access to potential new customers.<p>Groupon has proved how much businesses want potential new customers, I think this is an interesting twist and will perhaps generate better leads for coffeeshops than a groupon would.",1311980325

If you look at ren techs 45% return since its inception in 1988 i would not call that dubious, so there are players who understand the market and many dubious people who do not.<p>i think having a binary opinion about the merits of finance (specifically capital allocation) benefiting society are wrong. You can easily point to bernie madoff and say see...useless! or you can think of all the investors who had the courage and means to invest in apple computers or genentech. was correctly picking to allocating capital to apple a waste of societies resources?",1311980262

The only way I see that might work (though here Apple might still be a special case) is to create an environment where businesses see an increase in demand as an incentive for increased investment.<p>Then the question becomes where that demand should come from, and the most feasible short-term answer (the government) is almost universally ideologically opposed (yes, even Democrats these days seem to shy away from direct spending to stimulate the economy).",1311980232

Because my initial though was; ""who is this guy, and how the fuck do I go work for him?"".<p>I liked this; simple and clear rules that attempt to force ""underlings"" (who are obviously historically supposed to ass-kiss) to think critically, force time with the boss, advocate their experience, stand their ground - and so on.<p>Perhaps this was couched in a fairly direct tone; but then I suppose that is what I like :) Others I can understand wanting it presented in a different way.<p>But this is definitely the attitude to give your employees.<p>I love my job, and my boss is awesome. And I can advocate my ideas sometimes. But I often feel bad speaking up - for example his advertising prose is not very good at all, and I have been trying to tell him that politely for the last year (still not got the hint, and this is why having a boss as a friend is a bad move!). But I can't change it when he gives it to me to put on the site... (edit; and, uh, the point I am making here is that as awesome a boss he is, he doesn't give me the feeling I can go to that level of criticism)<p>I'd love to think that when I become a ""boss"" I'd be able to have this sort of attitude - the sort that says ""yes I make decisions, but if you think I am being an idiot, and can express why then sodding well tell me :)"".

They could offer insurance for this sort of situation (yes, they'd have to add an insurance fee or increase their rates for this to make business sense). They could implement credit card address verification, and require that a credit card be in their system for some period of time (3 or 5 days) with a hold on it before someone can make their first rental, which would make it a lot less likely that someone could effectively use a stolen credit card. They could verify phone numbers of guests and hosts by calling them (perhaps even with an automated system, that calls someone up and asks them to punch in a number they got when signing up for Airbnb), which would give an additional piece of evidence about someone's identity if needed. They could implement a trust system in which people with established histories using the system can vouch for someone else, and if no one vouches for you, then you need to do one of the above steps or some other form of additional identity verification.

MS, Apple et al. were fine to benefit from the fragments this might bring them when it was a fairly well guarded secret and it was assumed that the U.S. was on relatively equal footing with other countries such as France, UK, Germany, Japan in this regard.  The Snowden leaks show that the NSA capacity is a couple orders of magnitude larger than any other country and suddenly the U.S. players would lose more business through distrust than they would gain through government espionage.",1441810783

A snowflake and an avalanche also differ only in scale; that doesn&#x27;t mean that if you like a white Christmas you&#x27;d love being buried alive on K2. Scale is the difference between a refreshing drink and drowning.<p>Second, no public service operates under a mandate of &quot;maximum efficiency at any cost&quot;; they operate under legal and regulatory frameworks designed to balance various different public interests. Highways have speed limits and traffic laws and restrictions on driving while intoxicated, along with uniformed officers to enforce these. They all reduce the theoretical efficiency of the highway as a conveyor of traffic, but they&#x27;re there because there are other interests the highway needs to serve as well, like getting as few of the people who use it as possible killed. Different jurisdictions have different sets of laws that balance these interests in different ways, but they all try to balance them somehow.<p>Libraries are the same way. Knowledge-sharing is an important public interest that they serve, but the public has other interests as well. It has an interest in authors continuing to want to write books, for instance, and publishers continuing to want to publish them. So libraries strike a balance; they pay for their books, they lend them for a limited time, and so forth. These restrictions allow for wide public access without unduly cramping the market demand for books.<p>E-books make the old balance libraries set more complicated, since it&#x27;s harder to <i>lend</i> them. Without some kind of DRM, you&#x27;re not really lending them at all, you&#x27;re <i>giving free copies away,</i> which is something very different than what libraries do with physical books. DRM can address that, but it makes using the library&#x27;s resources more difficult and annoying. So the old balance needs to be recalibrated to find a way to meet all the interests the old one did. But replacing the world&#x27;s libraries with the Pirate Bay would be blowing up that balance completely, not recalibrating it.",1441810688

See<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/opinion/e-books-libraries-and-democracy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/opinion/e-books-libraries-...</a><p>for example. Some points from there:<p>1. It&#x27;s only been in the last couple years that all of the big publishers would actually sell eBooks to libraries. \n2. It&#x27;s not selling, it&#x27;s licensing, with severe restrictions.\n3. They charge higher rates for the eBooks to Libraries than they do to the general public.\n4. Some publishers only offer eBooks to libraries when the books have been out for six months.<p>Not in the article, but also important: publishers claim that libraries cannot simply digitize and loan out e-versions of their existing book catalogs--they claim that the eBooks are a different product, and that libraries have no license to do that. That would probably not stand up in court, but libraries aren&#x27;t eager to antagonize the publishers, from whom they are still trying to get regular eBooks at regular prices.<p>The article is kind of ill-informed on this, too, I&#x27;m afraid. The difference between filesharing and public libraries is that public libraries operate within de facto and legal restrictions that don&#x27;t apply to filesharing. A much better comparison, that fits the author&#x27;s claim that the only difference is efficiency, is home taping and CD-copying.",1441810630

Most people are unwilling to vote for a third-party/longshot candidate, as their vote would be &quot;wasted&quot;, despite the fact that their single vote is guaranteed not to matter. I think the driving motivation for most is the desire to be on the winning team, or if you&#x27;re in the wrong county/state, to be able to say you fought the good fight for your side. In other words, despite the secret ballot, people vote more for reasons of in-group signaling than attempting to influence policy.<p>As you say, the 50ish percent we do get is impressive. If we really care about turnout (and disincentivizing some of the shadier techniques campaigns use to manipulate turnout), we should turn Voting Day into a national holiday and a mandatory duty (perhaps with an opt-out &quot;I choose to abstain&quot; for true protest votes, but the point is that you still have to show up or mail your ballot, period.)",1441809519

This has the side effect of giving those support personnel access to just about everything else that group can get to, even if they don&#x27;t need it.<p>2 - Create a new group that&#x27;s just for delegating permissions for whatever content needs to be secured, and add both the service account and the users. This is analogous to using the new group as a quasi-ACL, IMO. It works, but quickly leads to group sprawl, and most of the Unix/Linux admins I&#x27;ve worked with are loathe to do it for this reason.<p>A secondary challenge with #2 is that larger organizations will usually have group membership controlled by some sort of administrative team.

Lets say 99% of teachers vote for party X, which is actually pretty accurate.  Then party X has no need whatsoever to represent the needs of teachers because they&#x27;re guaranteed all the votes no matter what they do in office.  Likewise no teachers vote for party Y by the definition of being a captured demographic.  That means party Y has no need to represent teachers because there is no reward.  Or rephrased, a captured demographic will not be represented because one party has no negative consequences, and the other has no positive consequences.<p>Its not so much an effect of voting as it is primary nomination effect.  Also voting isn&#x27;t necessarily the most important support, the PACs providing election funding are the most important form of support.<p>Many people are members of captive demographics, meaning they are un-represented.  Teachers, blacks, anti-abortion, feminists, more or less every orientation other than straight...  When you cross off all of them, there&#x27;s not much actual representing going on, for something calling itself a representative government.<p>One reason I often don&#x27;t vote is the only minimal impact I can make due to extreme gerrymandering is to protest the system.  Here&#x27;s one non-vote proclaiming I&#x27;m not represented.  I think the stats showing 4/5 of the population feel UN-represented are if anything an understatement of the facts.  Probably less than 5% of the population are represented at this time, the rest of the voters are just ill informed.<p>Another reason not to vote that you missed, voting is kind of an opiate of the masses to let them think they can provide input, which of course they cannot.  Once you understand that, its pointless.  Participating in voting is like people looking for religious enlightenment in opiates, you can delude yourself but it doesn&#x27;t really accomplish anything.  Whats in it for me to knowingly delude myself?<p>The final reason not to vote is rebellion.  Blind irrational faith in the election system is as close to an established state secular religion we have.  Not voting is as rebellious as being the only guy without tattoos or the only guy without body piercings.  Not voting is religious apostasy.  I&#x27;m about as likely to start voting as I am to throw stones at known adulterers or own a Canadian as a biblical slave.<p>There are other reasons like pragmatically the results of voting are bad governments, but thats a long debate.",1441809240

If these athletes are paid, do they still have to attend classes? Do they have to get good grades? Are they given scholarships in addition to monetary compensation?<p>No, players who are paid will be employees of the university and will receive a salary and benefits. They will not be students. Perhaps there could be a mechanism in place to allow for some players to receive a scholarship in lieu of payment if they choose to (with the caveat being that they need to be admitted to the University under the same criteria as other non-athlete students), but in reality most of these players in top D1 programs are there to play football or basketball, not to go to class.<p>> Can athletes switch colleges if another school will pay them more?<p>Why not?<p>> It seems to me that most of these problems would be solved by creating a minor league separate from college.

The manufacturer/dealer nexus forces you to depend on paid but poorly trained mechanics that quote ridiculous prices for repairing (essentially using re-furbished parts).<p>Another case, I&#x27;ve got a water purifier at home that uses a series of filters (sediment, reverse-osmosis, UV radiation, carbon etc.). Due to the quality of water supply, the sediment filter requires manual cleaning every month or two, else everything down the line stands a chance of getting damaged. These filters aren&#x27;t cheap ($100 every 2 years in a 3rd world country). I find it annoying that the design of these filters is such that it is cumbersome to remove that simple sediment filter. Almost everyone I know ends up paying the service provider for annual maintenance. In reality, a simple design change can make the maintenance super easy.<p>It&#x27;s the same story with modern cars, gadgets, washing machines, everything. The money to be made from repair is a whole industry. On the brighter side, the industry is begging to be disrupted.<p>P.S.

The question is, does the specification ever get updated to match the code&#x27;s behavior?<p>With Cucumber, you have a relatively clear specification (written in Gherkin&#x27;s Given-When-Then syntax), and it always remains up-to-date because the developer needs to update it as corner cases or new scenarios arise.

I&#x27;m actually more surprised that the number of professors over 60 is not 100% since that&#x27;s the only population surveyed.<p>The rest of the Wikipedia page is similarly biased, &quot;Today (2015), adjunct professors, hired for their low cost only, rather than expertise, make up more than half the teaching faculty at United States universities.&quot; I can&#x27;t tell if the Wikipedia article is intentionally ridiculous or if it&#x27;s some parody article.",1441808621

Every empty seat taking off on every flight is a spoiled grapefruit and exactly as valueless. Both required time, effort, and money to create, and both came to a wasteful, meaningless end. And on an exceedingly large number of flights, the sale of one last seat, according to the First Rule of Airline Economics, could easily decide whether the plane flew the entire distance in the red or the black. As the builder of American Airlines, C. R. Smith had agonized continually over the problem of matching passengers with seats before the latter perished upon departure. The trick was to balance reservations against inventory, a far greater task than it might seem. At first, in the early 1930s, a single ledger had passed from hand to hand as agents in a central office recorded reservations and erased those that were canceled.<p>> With the advent of the DC-3, as the fleets and schedules of the airlines swelled and as the seating capacity of each plane increased, a single book became impractical, so multiple books were maintained. These had to be reconciled frequently—a massively time-consuming process—and even so, each book was inherently out-of-date at all times. Books gave way to chalk and slate boards and eventually to electric light boards. More and more agents were crammed into the reservations offices, with the line of sight to the blackboard limited by the space between structural support columns—22 feet in most buildings of the time. Some agents peered through opera glasses. Teletypes clattered. Clerks known as “card boys” scurried from desk to desk, eventually to be replaced by mechanical conveyors. One blackboard gave rise to multiple blackboards, which quickly encountered the same problems that multiple ledgers had caused.<p>> A science called “reservations theory” was born to cope with the exponentially worsening challenge, but to little avail; as with so much else in the airline business, there was no economy of scale in handling reservations. The more the airlines grew, the less efficient they became. The need to coordinate reservations among multiple cities—indeed, among multiple airlines—added still another dimension of complexity. For most of their history the airlines had been scheduled like railroads: numerous stops along a single line, with passengers boarding and disembarking at each stop, sometimes to board a second flight on a different airline flying in a roughly perpendicular direction. Confirming the itinerary for a single passenger traveling on two connecting airlines required no fewer than 20 separate communications, making the airlines, even in the 1940s, among the world’s biggest users of leased telephone lines. But what if the entire process could be automated?<p>Petzinger Jr., Thomas (2010-12-01).

There are now two nonacademic employees at public and two and a half at private universities and colleges for every one full-time, tenure-track member of the faculty.<p>Yet, the universities are pumping out roughly the same number of graduates.<p>Why such high growth in administrators? Is our education now better than 1987? How come every other industry is cutting costs, while higher education is increasing costs and beaurocracy?",1441807319

I used to work with Cloverleaf and I ended up building my own endpoint; Cloverleaf would route all the messages I was interested in to my end point and then I&#x27;d ship them off to the appropriate application from there. The most interesting thing I did was look for messages from the Radiology system about scans (MRI, CAT Scan, X-Ray, etc.) and then notify the primary care physician for the patient (&quot;Hey, log in here to view then new imaging data for your patient!&quot;).<p>Something like this would make that much, much easier. Cloverleaf would route to this Apache product, which would then route to the appropriate service. The data on traffic, etc., would be especially useful (i.e., the service that sends faxes is slow, etc.)",1441807275

As far as I know, Apple has an architectural license that allows them to ship anything that passes a test suite.<p>I can&#x27;t find one actually, so perhaps I am wrong.  If it strictly based upon the test suite then maybe it&#x27;s sufficiently thorough that interesting alterations are effectively impossible (e.g. it could test you get invalid instruction exceptions when you feed in unused bits of instruction encoding space, preventing you from adding any).",1441807255

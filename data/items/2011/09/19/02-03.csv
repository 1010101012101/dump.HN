3012021,comment,3011014,3011014,5,0,mmaunder,,,"This is awesome data as usual from Vadim and team. I always thought the upper bound of InnoDB performance was limited by memory and how much you can afford. Now I know different.<p>I wanted to share some of our data to help in your decision making:<p>A typical server in our cluster gets 5000 to 7500 TPS:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/oT26G.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/oT26G.png</a><p>This is a 24 hour graph and as you can see there are no multi-minute lockups. We've been extremely happy with the performance our servers are delivering.<p>The config is 8GB of memory, RAID 1, 2X 15K RPM disks, single Intel E5410 quad core CPU.<p>Total DB size is around 12GB with around 15 million rows. Our TPS is higher than Vadim's but our data is smaller than the benchmark he uses which is 200 million rows in a 58 GB database.<p>With the following for innodb:<p><pre><code>  innodb_file_per_table = 1\n  innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0\n  innodb_buffer_pool_size = 5G\n  innodb_additional_mem_pool_size = 20M\n  innodb_log_file_size = 1024M\n  innodb_log_buffer_size = 16M\n  innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct = 90\n  innodb_thread_concurrency = 4\n  innodb_log_group_home_dir = /var/lib/mysql/\n  innodb_log_files_in_group = 2\n</code></pre>\nSo my approach to avoiding this issue will be to shard to finer granularity and avoid architectures with monolithic DB's. Keep in mind that this only affects your ability to cache greater than around 16GB, so spreading massive data across multiple servers with fast drives and moderate memory will help bring your TPS back up. I would also add that servers with memory > 32GB are very expensive - especially the memory itself. So it may not cost much more to have 5 servers with fast disk and moderate memory vs one server with massive memory.<p>Having said all that this is obviously a very serious problem and perhaps an opportunity for a talented computer scientist to branch InnoDB and solve it if Oracle doesn't want to.",1316400713

As I explained, NTBACKUP has this problem solved, with 'volume shadow copy', but the solution is involved.  You didn't describe how Mac has this problem solved.<p>As I explained, the problem with NTBACKUP is the documentation and getting the options so that the backup can be restored and be bootable.  Due to the documentation problems, that is NOT easy.<p>And once you have such a backup of a bootable partition, how do you restore it?  I do have a solution, have tested it, and have shown that it WORKS.<p>Again, yet again, there can be solutions with third party software and/or versions of Windows after XP SP3, but for that version of Windows what I wrote is a very accurate description of what HAS to be done if just using Microsoft's software.<p>Your claim that I am making things too difficult in backup is just flatly WRONG -- uninformed, misinformed, and just plain WRONG.<p>For Outlook, your solution was to use gmail.  That has some pros and cons, and I don't like the cons.<p>For writing down all the clicks in configuring Outlook, you don't have a better solution.  There are a LOT of options for Outlook -- a LOT.  Some of them are important for security.  About the only way to get all the options right is to do JUST what I did.  Security problems with bad options in e-mail programs have been grim for years; maybe most Outlook users without a support group to set all the options have some security holes.<p>Your claim that I am making things too difficult in Outlook is just flatly WRONG -- uninformed, misinformed, and just plain WRONG.<p>Heck, I even omitted describing setting options for Internet Explorer and Firefox.  For Firefox, a default option is to PERMIT running Java in a Web page.  OUTRAGEOUS security hole:  Java can do ANYTHING.  If a user is not REALLY careful with Firefox options, then they will have Java enabled.<p>Your<p>""though I've never met a serious programmer who actually uses Visual Basic""<p>taken literally means nothing but suggests something misinformed, uninformed, and just plain wrong:  In fact, on Windows, the .NET version of Visual Basic is fine:  It gives essentially full access to the basic 'common language runtime' (CLR) and .NET; it has full 'managed code' including its memory management; using another language on the CLR is mostly just a matter of different syntactic sugar.  An advantage of Visual Basic is that the syntax is easy to read and not borrowed from the too sparse and idiosyncratic C/C++ tradition as in C#.<p>When I hire people, I will have them start on Visual Basic because it is easier to get going with than C#.<p>On Windows, what language would you use?  C/C++?  That's not Windows 'managed code', and managed code is IMPORTANT.  So your main options will be C# or Visual Basic.  You could use either one, but working for me I'd ask you to use Visual Basic.  You would not be able to use C/C++.<p>Your claim that I am doing something wrong using Visual Basic .NET is just flatly WRONG -- uninformed, misinformed, and just plain WRONG.<p>For your<p>""I don't even know what you're talking about when you say you ""index"" and ""abstract"" API docs--I just keep them open in a browser window and search for things I don't remember offhand.""<p>your confession that you don't know is on target.  As I wrote, I have something over 2500 Web pages of Microsoft MSDN documentation.  For those 2500 pages, what you described is not a solution.  For a solution, my ""index"" and ""abstract"" are a good solution:  So, I have some simple, 'flat ASCII' files.  I have one for each of Visual Basic, Windows, ASP.NET, and SQL Server.  Typically I have about two of these files open in my favorite editor.  For an issue, say, about ASP.NET or related parts of .NET or communications, I start with the file for ASP.NET.  In that file each Web page of documentation has a few lines.  Some of the lines give the title of the Web page; another line gives the tree name of that Web page on my system; those two lines form the 'index' and are an appropriate use of 'index'.  Also there are a few more lines that say a little more about what is in the page, typically copied from the first paragraph or two of the page.  If the page is a good 'root' page for a larger topic, then that is noted.  Those extra lines are the 'abstract'.  And there can be some additional notes of mine.<p>To find something, I just use the 'locate' command of my editor.  Then to open the Web page, in my editor I give one keystroke on the line with the tree name.<p>Works fine.<p>But there's no way, as you suggest, to have all 2500 Web page files open at once, and your solution said nothing about how to find the right one of the 2500 pages but my solution did.  And there is no XP SP3 'search' function nearly as effective as what I have with the four files and my editor.<p>Your solution with 2500 Web pages would be much less productive, not more.<p>Same for using a weak editor, C/C++, MAKE instead of a scripting language, and more.  And your suggestion for backup on XP SP3 has little chance of resulting in being able to restore the boot partition so that it will boot.<p>Your claim that I am doing something wrong with my indexing and abstracting of those 2500 Web pages is just flatly WRONG -- uninformed, misinformed, and just plain WRONG.<p>For your ""ignorant"", ""irrational compulsion"", ""unproductive busywork"", those are all insulting, uninformed, misinformed, and just plain WRONG.<p>Again, yet again, one more time, the original question, go back and read it for yourself, was:<p>""I want to start a startup, but I don't know how to program.  How long will it take to learn?""<p>and you responded with<p>""That's all I needed to do to be productive""<p>which does not answer the original question.<p>E.g., you said nothing about SQL Server.  Hmm ....  So, yes, from a plugin in a Web browser, I got a virus.  Right:  Now I keep nearly all plugins disabled.  Have to work at this since some software installs and enables browser plugins without notice.  That virus was from one use of the Akamai download manager to get a PDF file on a motherboard from an Asus Web site.  Bummer.<p>So, to be sure to solve the virus problem, I reinstalled Windows, Office .NET, TeX, SQL Server, etc.<p>Then I wanted SQL Server to read my old database, which was not on the boot drive and not damaged in the reinstallation.  So, I used the T-SQL CREATE with ATTACH.  This didn't work (for complicated reasons, not my fault).  Finally, in trying to get SQL Server to use my old database, SQL Server got 'sick' and quit doing much of anything.  So, I tried to uninstall SQL Server.  It wouldn't.  I tried to 'repair' it; it wouldn't repair.  I tried to reinstall SQL Server; it wouldn't.  Basically SQL Server had just wiped out my boot drive, and I had to start over with the boot drive.  BUMMER.<p>Now I have a backup, bootable, of my boot partition with everything installed EXCEPT SQL Server so that if SQL Server ruins my boot partition again I will be able to restore the boot partition from just before SQL Server and then reinstall SQL Server.  Some of what is important with Windows and SQL Server 'administration and management'.<p>Yes, I have more than one bootable partition!<p>One of the problems was that when I installed SQL Server as I had before the virus, what was installed was different -- strongly against my wishes, I ended up with two versions of SQL Server with 'side by side' installation.  Well, apparently 'side by side' is just awash in bugs so that can't uninstall, repair, or reinstall.<p>I finally got through it, but it was NOT fast.<p>You didn't mention SQL Server.  But for the original question, SQL Server or some substitute stands to be important.<p>So, what you are doing that is ""productive"" does not answer the original question.  I answered the original question, and you didn't.<p>On what I'm doing, you are WRONG, consistently, 100% WRONG.<p>That's enough of responding to your errors.",1316399575

3011962,comment,3011857,3011857,1,0,mattbillenstein,,,"I believe the original article was pretty much spot on - the problem with suggesting to move to NoSQL is that there are tools that try to be an ORM in those data stores as well (see MongoKit, MongoEngine, MongoMapper, et al) that carry a lot of the same problems as ORMs for SQL databases.  NoSQL is not immune to this sort of code-masturbation.<p>The best solution I've found is to drop all the fancy relational-like features of the ORM (lazy loading, etc) - use the databases native apis to query the data - it requires you to mostly understand what you're doing and your code is explicit in how it's accessing the database.  But, objects are nice, so keep that part and use a simple object mapper to map the raw document to an object where it makes sense.<p>Building a simple object mapper on top of pymongo is actually really easy - I rolled my own in an afternoon - so I get objects where I want them without all the ORM-like crap.  It's also really handy for enforcing some sort of schema in a schema-less database - most of the time I want a document to have a fixed set of fields, using the object mapper to enforce this handy and adding a field is easy provided you put a sensible default in the object for documents which won't have that field already.",1316398768

3011960,comment,3011822,3011918,29,0,jfruh,,,"I think one of the problems of wealth distribution and attitudes about it in the U.S. is that it does shoot up so rapidly in the upper 1%.  We're a very upward-looking society so it's easy for someone making $250K a year to say ""I'm not rich, I still have a mortgage, I have to work for a living I can't just spend whatever I want, whenever I want -- I know there are people further up the latter than me who have so much more money, I must be middle class.""<p>Absolute percentiles are useful because they do show you where you stand in relation to the rest of society.  Families making $250K may not be Scrooge McDuck-style super-rich, but they're indisputably in the top few percent of the nation in terms of income.  It's hard for those folks to claim to be middle class when 90+ percent of their fellow citizens make less.<p>It's also worth noting that people's lifestyles and ""necessities"" expand to fit their income, particularly if their income goes up relatively gradually.  I've literally heard people say, ""Well, I make $400K a year but I'm not rich because it costs a lot of money to pay mortgage and taxes in Westchester County and send my kids to private school and drive a nice car.""

3011918,comment,3011822,3011822,11,0,callmeed,,,"I know this is wealth and not income, but I get sick of the media (and politicians) using the ""top 1%"" or ""top 5%"" label.<p>When it comes to income, the top 1% includes an attorney making $250K and a hedge fund manager making $10M. I imagine its similar for wealth. My guess is that distribution curves spike somewhere past the 1% mark.<p>Maybe I'm biased because I barely make the cut and don't want to pay more taxes, but it seems odd to use such an arbitrary cutoff for reporting and (especially) policy decisions.<p>And please tell me if I'm wrong or off hereI'm geniunely interested in this.<p>EDIT: downvoted?

Even if wages remain the same at the bottom while wealth at the top increases tenfold, the poor are worse off. They are worse off because they will see their political power decrease, especially in a country like America where that is so tied to money, and they are worse off because income disparities decrease quality of life across the board (i.e. for rich and poor alike).<p>There isn't the clear separation that you are putting forward here.",1316397604

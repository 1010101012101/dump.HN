1236578,comment,1236415,1236432,0,0,tsally,,,"Every time the US postal service comes up in discussion, someone invariably mentions how life would be so much better if the service was privatized.  I think this argument represents a fundamental misunderstanding of public services; the post office is perhaps the canonical example of an extremely important service that only can exist in the public sector.  As others have mentioned already (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1236487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1236487</a>), delivering a piece of paper from California to Maine for under a dollar is not something the private sector can provide.<p>As a rule of thumb, if your gut tells you that a particular service is essential to a civilized society the service belongs in the public sector.  As a nation we've decided the ability to affordability correspond with others around the country is such a service. Education is another.  These two examples are extraordinarily complex problems which the US public sector solves well, all things considered.  Yet every time we discuss these services someone always wants to privatize them.<p>For the most fundamental components of our society, privatization is never the answer.",1270220262

Often times academic code is slow to be released because the types of things that tend to be thought of as required for software release (documentation, install help, bug fixes, coherent code organization) simply aren't there. The reward system set up by academia doesn't place value on those types of things, so it takes a long time to get them done in your free time. The result is people are hesitant to release their code because they know it will likely be difficult to put to ""real"" use without heavy refactoring.<p>Just my 2c.",1270218840

6601270,comment,6596038,6598932,2,0,mattwallaert,,,"Sorry, I&#x27;m a little confused as to how you think Microsoft has historically made products that are &quot;irrelevant to the end user&quot;, when Microsoft powers the majority of computing activity worldwide and has for more 20 years.<p>What it feels like you may instead be trying to say is &quot;I don&#x27;t like Windows 8 and think Linux/OS X are better&quot;, which is certainly a valid opinion statement.  I wouldn&#x27;t, however, labor under the misunderstanding that Microsoft doesn&#x27;t care about users - hyperbole aside, do you actually think that of a company of about 100K people doesn&#x27;t care about other people?<p>If you&#x27;ve ever worked on a big tech product, you know that agonizing amounts of attention are spent worrying about even the smallest details.  Ultimately, that might mean that we don&#x27;t always make the best possible decision, but I think it would be tough to say that Microsoft &quot;half-assed&quot; much.<p>It makes sense that you don&#x27;t like the product; not everyone does.  But it seems foolish to equate your dislike with a) it being objectively bad, b) it being half-assed, c) it being irrelevant (particularly when it plays a huge role in the world), or d) that the people creating it don&#x27;t care about it or you.  Indeed, d) is particularly important - isn&#x27;t it grand that you live in a tech world where someone like me, who works at Microsoft, cares about your thoughts and feelings, even though you don&#x27;t use Windows?<p>Microsoft (and many other companies) don&#x27;t just care about the people who use our products...we also care about the people who don&#x27;t.",1382558359

It aims to be portable, but true portability means that the C/C++ developer really shouldn&#x27;t have to know/care what assembly instructions the compiler/linker is emitting, because all of that stuff depends on which chip architecture you&#x27;re targeting.<p>Basically, coding in C/C++ requires an intimate knowledge of how the compiler works, and sometimes even how the target chip works. C/C++ software projects of notable size oftentimes cannot be simply recompiled/linked to a different target architecture without changing things like compiler flags, the makefile, and even the application code itself. That makes it a non-portable, leaky abstraction, and dramatically increases the amount of knowledge that&#x27;s required of a C/C++ developer.",1382558242

I could see all of those features being useful and integrating well into the rest of the app, though setting up edges to work within might require a bit to much UI compared to the gain in typical usage.<p>I went back and forth on the number of taps required to open up the brush or tools menu - the current implementation will open the menu directly if you already have that tool selected, and switch to the tool otherwise. Ex if calligraphy is selected then you touch brushes -> menu opens. If calligraphy is selected and you touch tools, then the eraser (or the MRU tool) is selected and the menu does not open.<p>This flow works really well when you switch are switching between 2 types of anything, like between calligraphy and the pencil, or calligraphy and the eraser and (I like it because) it doesn&#x27;t have popups flying in your face constantly. It works less well if you switch between 3 (ex calligraphy->eraser->pencil.) A second downside is that the logic behind when 1 or 2 clicks is required is somewhat less than obvious.<p>(You can delete drawings, press and hold on the thumbnail in the homescreen)",1382558199

I&#x27;m confident that more bacterial lineages will be wiped out before human medicine is seriously compromised by natural selection of bacteria that are resistant to most antibiotics used in human medicine.<p>Do a dumb test. Walk into your nearest hospital, I don&#x27;t even want to know which it is. Ask how many patients are infected with mRSA. Collect your jaw from the floor when they give you an answer that&#x27;s 15% if you&#x27;re lucky, 60-70% if you&#x27;re unlucky. We have lost the fight with bacteria. It&#x27;s over. We aren&#x27;t &quot;about to&quot; lose it, we lost it ~1 year ago, and medicine is fast losing the ability to treat bacterial disease. We lost the fight with viruses a decade ago. If you get infected with a deadly viral disease, like rabies, it&#x27;s curtains. There&#x27;s nothing any hospital can do for you except sedate you until you&#x27;re dead.<p>We are in fact well on our way to transform hospitals into deathtraps.<p>> Evolution is actually a really crappy optimization algorithm. The reason it has worked so well is not that it is so effective, but because it&#x27;s the only game in town.<p>First of all, the obvious advantage of evolution is it&#x27;s running time, 3.5 billion years. Second you probably subscribe to the naive notion that evolution, in 3.5 billion years running time, somehow failed to realize that mutation + natural selection is very, very slow. It didn&#x27;t. The algorithm that, today, controls evolution of pretty much any species works entirely different from what most textbooks teach you. There are very, very few species that evolve through mutation and selection. We evolve through copying of other&#x27;s genes, simulation and symbiosis (yes, genes can simulate the effect other genes will have on them. Also, most &quot;life&quot; functions of a human body, like breathing, metabolism, ... are actually performed by symbiotic bacteria on our behalf. Human cells can&#x27;t actually do it themselves).<p>Unfortunately, if you study how evolution actually works you&#x27;ll realize what it means for resistant bacteria. Once a fully resistant bacterial strain evolves, a process that takes between decades and centuries, all other species of bacteria will quickly copy the resistance, in a matter of months to years. Which is exactly what we&#x27;ve seen happening.<p>You&#x27;ll also quickly realize that no matter how well-intentioned your use of bacteriophages is, it is very, very likely to make things worse, not better.",1382558007

They don&#x27;t get a computer because they want something to tinker with and figure out how it works for hundreds of hours a week, they want a computer to do something for them that will enrich or simplify their life in some fashion.<p>Perhaps if some of the more fundamental features were fixed instead of adding nice to have trinkets, you&#x27;d find more people will take it more seriously.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to go and hack around with complicated and potentially not-yet-existing files, referencing incomplete or inaccurate blog posts written by the last guy who tried what you&#x27;re attempting and got so pissed off with it that he thought he&#x27;d save the next idiot the headache he&#x27;d just gone through - only to omit the most important piece of information that&#x27;s not to be found anywhere else on the internet.<p>That is why Windows has a major market. Because unlike Linux, shit just works... for the most part.<p>They say that Linux is free as in &quot;freedom&quot;, but honestly, how free are you when you have to spend all your time tied to the computer just to get shit working?<p>I&#x27;m trying to love Linux, I really am, I&#x27;m on my 4th distro in 2 months and so far I feel like the only thing I&#x27;ve achieved is getting Stockholm Syndrome.<p>If Steam can fix this, I say please, please bring it on. Torvalds, I think you&#x27;ve got the right idea, honest to God I do, and I&#x27;m trying to love your system but it seriously needs some love from developers and usability experts that understand people.",1382557938

Cook stumbled on some words, almost all of his presenters did also. The Black Knight reference was such a dumb mistake to make it&#x27;s almost comical - if your such a fan of the Dark Knight, you&#x27;d have gotten the name right. I&#x27;d have at least corrected myself...<p>2: Everything was incremental which I think was to be expected; what I didn&#x27;t expect was non-retina display MacBook Pro&#x27;s to basically receive 0 updates and the strong push towards Retina based MBP&#x27;s - the 15 inch MBP Retina which is what I would purchase if I was in the market for a new laptop seams higher priced then usual. For sure, this is to account for the retina display, but... ?<p>3: I like that the iPad Mini is more or less identical to the iPad Air and I think the price points are good. Why no Gold version? Both iPads got the A7 and motion processors. I can understand no Touch ID knowing how Apple operates - new features like this are held back a year (for no apparent reason) but at least make the lines match. I could imagine the house wifes and the like buying gold iPad Minis to match their new gold iPhone 5s.<p>4: The whole thing seamed pretty unrehearsed and kinda dry. I am NOT attributing this to Steve Jobs not being present, unlike most will in the press. I think Tim Cook is doing a fine job (albeit, incremental) it just all seamed a bit... sloppy?<p>??",1382557134

6601145,comment,6598435,6600943,2,0,tzs,,,"(Might as well add one more interesting little copyright twist that might have some interesting consequences for free software, and that has been almost completely overlooked)<p>In the US, there is a very interesting thing in copyright called the termination right. It probably won&#x27;t have much affect on software (it is mostly a music and book thing), but there is a remote chance it could be significant in some cases.<p>The termination right was meant to address the situation where you have a young artist who produces a great work when they are early enough in their career that they are unknown and have almost no bargaining power, and the artist ends up making very little money from the work--it is the music company or book publishers that signs them that ends up making a ton of money.<p>What the termination right does, basically, is 35 years after the artist signed away their copyrights to the music company or book publisher, the artist is given a window in which they can take back the copyright. They can then negotiate a new deal with the publishers, with much better terms now that they are an established artist instead of an unknown kid.<p>You might expect publishers would be smart, and include in their contracts with new young artists that the artist agrees not to invoke the termination right when it vests. Congress was smart enough to realize that publishers would do that, and so made it so that you cannot contract away your termination right.<p>As I said, this is generally irrelevant for software. First, termination rights do not apply to works for hire. Almost all closed source software is written as a work for hire, I suspect. So, as amusing as it would be for some retired COBOL programmer to reclaim copyright on some major bank&#x27;s ancient but still in service mainframe software, it probably is not going to happen.<p>Second, not much software survives 35 years. Even if something does not officially get replaced or retired, over 35 years it will usually accumulate enough piecemeal rewrites that nothing is left of the original--not even as a derivative work.<p>Still, with open source, we now have a lot of code in wide use that was NOT work for hire. Could there be fragments of open source projects that actually make it through 35 years intact, and make the termination right actually relevant?",1382557107

6601047,comment,6600577,6600752,5,0,green7ea,,,"The interesting thing is that sometimes, interpreted bytecode is faster than native instructions. First of all, bytecode isn&#x27;t usually interpreted but rather Just In Time (JIT) compiled. This means that it&#x27;s a little bit slower the first time you call a function as it&#x27;s being compiled. The compilation times aren&#x27;t huge however as the bytecode has already been optimized and it maps fairly straightforwardly to machine code. In a game, most of the time is spent in a few functions called by the game loop. After these functions are called once, they are usually as fast as the compiled version.<p>The area in which bytecode can gain an edge is with sse instructions and aggressive inlining. When you compile your game for the i386, you can&#x27;t assume that the processor you target has all the new SIMD (single instruction multiple dispatch) available. Now this isn&#x27;t a problem on consoles since you know your target but it is on the PC. The JIT compilation can take advantage of these instructions since they can detect their availability at runtime (which is also compile time).<p>The other neat trick that JIT compilation can do is profile the code as it is running (less costly than it sounds) and inline hot functions. You can&#x27;t do this with c++ because you can&#x27;t unlink the code easily. A good example of this technique is found in the V8 javascript engine.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that bytecode is always faster but rather to point out that using intermediate bytecode doesn&#x27;t always carry a high performance penalty. What kills C# are the GC pauses. Also keep in mind that nothing can ever beat well optimized assembly for a target processor but the people who can do this are rare and valuable.",1382556211

Allowing urban voters to dictate policy affecting rural voters under the name of democracy just because there are more urban voters could turn out to be a very bad idea, because urban voters are not necessarily well-informed on issues that apply to rural America. This in turn be bad for everyone, as the urban voters depend on rural America to produce food.<p>The debate over firearms is a simple example. Urban voters do not see why rural voters cannot simply depend on the police to maintain law and order. Rural voters on the other hand do not see why urban voters think the police can respond in time. The difference is their context. Urban voters are probably right- in the context of a city.<p>(I am not arguing about firearms, I just thought the debate was an easy illustrative example of how your context matters)<p><i>There aren&#x27;t two sides to every issue.

The problem is the anti-bacterial part. It puts amounts of a broad spectrum antibiotic into the environment (be it your hands, your countertop, or the water system) in concentrations that aren&#x27;t enough to do much, but are enough to put a little bit of selective pressure on the organisms and promote resistance.<p>It&#x27;s also not particularly effective - soap and water, through a combination of both mechanical action and how soap disrupts cell membranes, works swimmingly. So there&#x27;s a cost, and no benefit.<p>The answer to &#x27;why isn&#x27;t there a resistance to soap&#x27; is that soap, as a chemical, is absurd overkill. It&#x27;s hellish on lipids of all sorts (tough on grease...and lipid cell membranes), and there&#x27;s nothing to evolve a resistance <i>to</i>. Not expressing a particular protein, or expressing an enzyme that does a number on an antibiotic compound is effective - to evolve a resistance to soap, you&#x27;d somehow have to develop an entirely new type of compound to build cell membranes out of.<p>And while evolution is rather magnificent, that&#x27;s asking a little much.",1382555469

6600938,comment,6599040,6599795,31,0,tokenadult,,,"General reply to express thanks for and respond to the several replies my first comment here received. First of all, I wrote in the original reply, &quot;his warnings should be taken seriously,&quot; so I am by no means disagreeing with the quoted CDC expert about his general policy recommendations. Indeed, I am on record here on HN[1] saying that I&#x27;d like to see the United States follow the lead of the EU immediately in banning antibiotics used in human medicine (especially last-line antibiotics used for antibiotic-resistant human disease) from use on farms. That seems like a sensible way to segregate the ecosystems in which microorganisms develop antibiotic resistance by haphazard evolution through natural selection.<p>I respectfully note the disagreement of several participants here have with me. They disagree with my disagreement with the interviewed expert&#x27;s casual language about thoughtful agency by bacteria. Noting your statements that this is just everyday conversational usage, I stand by my objection to that fallacious manner of speaking. Most people in the English-speaking world think erroneously about biological evolution and especially about the implications of evolution for human medicine. I am not alone in thinking that popular thinking about biology needs to be improved by rejecting the idea of organismal agency in evolution,[2] although it is remarkably hard to find this kind of careful thinking by a Google search amid the flood of webpages that specifically assert a purpose or intention to evolution by natural selection. Ernst Mayr, mentioned in one reply to my first comment here, is indeed a rare example of a reliable author on that issue. Human beings have a cognitive bias of attributing agency to inanimate objects,[3] and the reactions to my first comment suggest how deep-seated that cognitive bias is.<p>The entire revised introduction to the thirtieth anniversary edition of Richard Dawkins&#x27;s book <i>The Selfish Gene</i>[4] appears to be available for free online reading, and Dawkins writes explicitly about what level of analysis can be useful when pretending that genes have intentions and goals while thinking about problems in evolutionary theory. The University of California Berkeley website about evolution has a good page about antibiotics[5] that makes helpful medical practice and public policy suggestions with more cautious language.<p>There is a testable prediction here of course: either bacteria outrun human antibiotic development or they do not. I&#x27;m confident that more bacterial lineages will be wiped out before human medicine is seriously compromised by natural selection of bacteria that are resistant to most antibiotics used in human medicine. The precautionary principle suggests that we follow the quoted expert&#x27;s policy recommendations, but meanwhile conduct research for a deeper understanding of the biochemistry of harmful microorganisms and their ecology.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5674781"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5674781</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/natural-selection-and-evolution-material-blind-mindless-and-purposeless/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/natural-s...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/3951/is-there-a-cognitive-bias-for-ascribing-agency-to-inanimate-objects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/3951/is-there-a-co...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=koaD_Aod_V0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=organisms+want+to+survive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=koaD_Aod_V0C&printsec=front...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/medicine_03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/medicine_03</a><p>Two other comments at this level express the nub of the argument:<p><i>I&#x27;m slightly bugged by &quot;desire&quot; type language because it does actually cause problems in how laymen think about evolution. It&#x27;s not uncommon to hear them make the mistake of thinking evolution will &quot;think ahead&quot;. But the bigger problem I have with it is the &quot;anything we do ... bacteria will eventually discover&quot;.<p>Some problems are just very difficult to evolve around, and it&#x27;s hard to predict what they&#x27;ll be even if you have a complete working knowledge of an organism&#x27;s genome and biological workings. If the problem space doesn&#x27;t contain a solution that can be climbed toward without sacrificing fitness in the short term, it is unlikely that it will ever be found by evolution.<p>Evolution is actually a really crappy optimization algorithm. The reason it has worked so well is not that it is so effective, but because it&#x27;s the only game in town.</i><p>That is very well put, and deserves your upvote.<p><i>At what point do we start designing RNA with a delivery mechanism that attaches itself to a specific bacterial type and eliminates it?</i><p>A good question.

There is an enormous difference between &quot;good enough&quot; and &quot;rock solid.&quot;<p>&quot;I much rather have this than the previous system, which is insecure by design (ie: your funds can and are systematically stolen through inflation and other means).&quot;<p>Perhaps so, but as I have noted elsewhere, Bitcoin is not a fiat currency killer.  Most businesses that claim to accept Bitcoin payments are actually accepting fiat currency payments.  Most adults still need to pay their taxes.  There are strong incentives to issue loans in the currency that the courts deal in i.e. fiat currency.<p>Basically, think of it this way:  if Bitcoin exchanges were to disappear right now, what would happen to Bitcoin?  What reason is there to think that Bitcoin will ever reach a point where it is not utterly dependent on the existence of exchanges?  When even people who want to adopt Bitcoin are only doing so with the help of services that automatically exchange Bitcoin payments for fiat currency, why should we believe that we can ever live in a world where Bitcoin stands on its own two feet?<p>Finally, let&#x27;s assume that there is an economic theory that supports a system like Bitcoin i.e. a currency that has no central authority and no intrinsic value.  That theory should <i>motivate</i> a security definition.  As a point of reference, consider Chartalism (a key part of modern monetary theory), which basically explains why fiat currency works (in a nutshell:  the government issues the money and requires you to return some amount later on via taxes), and a key security definition used in the academic work on digital cash (in a nutshell:  you have security if it is infeasible to deposit more money with the bank than was withdrawn [this can be stated more formally]).  Note the very clear connection:  the central authority issues the currency and decides its validity when it is &quot;deposited.&quot;<p>So, to bring things full circle, I give you this challenge:  present an economic theory to explain systems like Bitcoin, and use that theory to motivate a security definition that Bitcoin can be tested against (or better yet, proved to meet).",1382554862

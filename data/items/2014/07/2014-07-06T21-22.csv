7995998,comment,7994673,7995439,3,0,Jhsto,,,"Thank you for your reply! I found it well thought and I&#x27;ll surely memorize some bullet points for my later career.<p>I&#x27;ve been very humble with my pricing so far because people don&#x27;t really take me seriously if I try to pull that kind of wages. You see, I have neither a degree or the age which would do the trick. Past work is kind of there, but instead of URLs the clients I&#x27;ve met in person just want to know whether <i>their</i> software can be done. Peers my age are working in labor jobs for the normal 9to5 and some even brag how they can pull out 17 hours of work in 24 hours. I&#x27;ve noticed that people treat software development with the very same idea, where the young have the endurance to pull out sick work hours and where more hours equals more work done. People seem to be afraid of hiring someone who says their hourly wage is starting from 40â‚¬, especially when the person can&#x27;t, thanks to their lack of experience, say how many hours they&#x27;ll eventually need. Therefore, for the sake of getting any clients in my first steps of lone entrepreneur, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with the lump sum.<p>It really is a pity that I can&#x27;t get around keeping the work hours as my own business, but so far I&#x27;ve found it easier than introducing them completely new way of working, where part of the time is spent on thinking instead of doing work. Until the latest incident, I had never even crossed the idea that the client may think they are getting screwed, thinking that the work they asked was really just that easy to do (because I was left with so little hours).<p>But about the price negotiation, yes, I agree with you and I&#x27;ll not let them do that. Our negotiations had no agreement on the hours I should spend, so they have no reason to drive the price down because of that.<p>I&#x27;m going to be honest with you and tell you that I haven&#x27;t made a single black-on-white agreement on what defines &quot;done&quot;. Instead, the idea has been that I&#x27;ll remain as the lone owner of the software, with the exclusive rights to re-sell it. I&#x27;m currently looking for the chance of turning the software into a SaaS, in which the original client has agreed on helping me by referring businesses from the same field to use it. So basically, I&#x27;m charging the original client one year worth of the subscription I&#x27;ve been planning on selling it for. By so, I&#x27;m basically securing at least one customer for the service for one year. At the same time, I&#x27;ll basically launch a service which has proven to have at least some kind of demand. Plus I get free marketing from the original client on the same run.<p>You see, if they would be able to refer even two customers, I&#x27;d be glad, as that&#x27;s the turning point where it&#x27;s financially sane for me to get a LLC for my programming work (that&#x27;s a huge thing for me in a country where you lose most of welfare state&#x27;s benefits by starting one). Everything above that is really just a bonus. But should I get 20 recurring sales, I&#x27;d already make enough money that I could live (in theory) the rest of my life with the money I make from the product per month. You could say it&#x27;s a risky shot, but as long as I can do the thing I like and get paid for it, I&#x27;ll keep choosing the risk.",1404683766

7995991,comment,7993482,7995642,2,0,mbell,,,"> I just want to mention that beat is talking about phase alignment between identical signals, which our perceptual network is incredibly sensitive to.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. If you have two signals emitting from physically separate location and they are out of phase, you just get comb filtering. Is it audible? It can be, but its not the phase you&#x27;re hearing, it&#x27;s the drastic frequency notching in amplitude. More importantly, you&#x27;re going to get comb filtering no matter what you do with a multi-speaker setup. Just move your head a couple inches out of the ideal sweet spot equidistance from each speaker and you&#x27;ll have created an effective phase shift and get the same type of comb filtering. In other words even with a theoretically perfect pair of time aligned speakers with perfect cross-overs, you&#x27;ll still get comb filtering if you take various measurements around the listening area. Just moving the mic 4 inches can have drastic effects on the measured response. Incidentally if you&#x27;ve ever seen someone taking a measurement with a sound meter and rhythmically moving the mic around in a strange fashion, they are doing that to try to even the effects of comb filtering.<p>> This is a critical aspect of crossovers- since they contain the same signal, any phase differences between the intersecting components are easy to pick up by the ear and very difficult to measure since it won&#x27;t show up as a frequency or amplitude differential.<p>If you&#x27;re taking a measurement in the crossover region and there is a phase shift between the drivers you most certainly will see an effect in amplitude as you&#x27;ll have at least partial wave cancellation. You can certainly take measurements in locations what won&#x27;t show this, but that is always true. You can take measurements of a perfectly time aligned speaker that make it look like it has phase issues too, if you put the mic in the right spot.<p>Likely the largest improvement you get from time alignment of the drivers in a multi-way speaker is the ability to control vertical lobe tilting, but you can &#x27;fix&#x27; that issue with MTM layouts without time aligning the drivers as well.",1404683684

For Google the money ends up sitting in Bermuda: not a place noted for its abundance of cheap colo space or computer scientists. Obviously it isn&#x27;t going to stay there because there&#x27;s nothing to spend it on. Instead the money sits offshore until something more useful is found.<p>What US companies <i>want</i> to happen is that the US Govt puts in place a &quot;tax holiday&quot; in which they temporarily stop being idiots and use the same tax rules as the rest of the world, thus allowing those companies to move the money earned abroad back into the USA without it being taxed twice (once by the country where it was earned and once by Uncle Sam). This has happened before so they think maybe it&#x27;ll happen again. Then they can spend it on building fancy offices and hiring splurges, all of which yields taxable income inside the USA.<p>What actually tends to happen is that politicians, even the ones that acknowledge the sense of this, don&#x27;t like being seen to give big companies a tax break. So they prevaricate and eventually the money gets spent abroad in places like Europe or Asia, where double taxation treaties work properly. At that point the money gets taxed via payroll taxes, employee income taxes, VAT etc. Own goal for America.<p>Still ... the money doesn&#x27;t sit there because they want to avoid US taxes.

This also makes us tend to buy relatively useless tools/toys like power tools and big trucks, to make us feel strong. IMO this is a close analogue to the common female concern with aesthetic adornment. Women mock us, justifiably, for the dominance contests we like to get into, stemming from the same desire to be strong.<p>Of course, women have their own analogues of our dominance contests. The deep fundamentals are the same, what differs is more our interpretation. Both sets of instincts stem from where we first look to power.

You can have sales tax, but governments already do that and they aren&#x27;t satisfied.<p>The reason taxing a person&#x27;s income is (relatively) easy is because you can&#x27;t split a person up. Just count the number of days they spend in a country, if it goes over a certain level then they are resident for tax purposes and away you go. America ignores this of course with citizen based taxation a.k.a. modern slavery but in all the other civilised countries that&#x27;s how it works.<p>Now consider Google. A German user goes to YouTube and sees an advert. Is this money made in Germany? Or was it made in America, where the software was developed? Or in America and Switzerland because there&#x27;s a YouTube team in Switzerland too? Or was it made in Finland where the request was actually processed? Or was it made in Canada because that&#x27;s where the advertiser is? Or was it made in Ireland because the advertisers contract was with Google Ireland Ltd?<p>Pretty quickly you realise this is a fools errand. There&#x27;s no way to say where the money was made in such an international operation. Any definition you come up with will be fought over by governments endlessly because they all want to buy votes by taxing foreign companies which smells to them a lot like free money (and thus free voters).<p>So we end up with the simplest definition possible - the money is made where the company is headquartered. The headquarters can be anywhere. This solution was arrived at in both America and Europe. It sorta worked for a while because most companies were already established and new companies were small and poor so nobody cared about them much. Now we have the phenomenon of new companies that are extremely profitable, do all their business on the internet and therefore could pick a country to headquarter in purely for tax reasons. Cue moaning and wailing from stupid politicians who ran up enormous debts and now want a bigger slice of the pie.<p>But attempting to change this simple definition will just reopen pandora&#x27;s box.<p>The best solution would be to just finish off the race to the bottom entirely and push corporate tax rates to zero everywhere. This would yield an approximately 25% hole in for example the UK budget. However the money can be made up elsewhere, such as by increasing VAT or personal income taxes. Of course that is politically difficult - people like corporation taxes because they don&#x27;t like corporations, and taxing them feels like free money too.",1404682927

Did they achieve that by just writing giant gobs of code and then circling back afterwards to fix a few hotspots? I think about how Chrome was such a delight after FireFox got slower and slower and more bogged down. Clearly, Chrome was written from the ground up to avoid that. I am not so sure you can really optimise for performance after the fact, at least not universally. There are times when you have to build it into the very fabric of a project right from the start.

For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a sourdough recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This of course immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you&#x27;ve never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations.<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#Informal_definition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#Informal_definition</a><p>Recursion quickly causes a stack overflow when you get it wrong in a strict language (and sometimes even when you get it right!), iteration does not (rather, the CPU just spins and memory is safe).

In maybe the first 3 - 4 hours of sleep, you are deep in. That&#x27;s the most productive sleep. Though you might go through a few cycles in that time, the cycles are deep. Then the cycles get less and less deep until the final hours in which you are barely sleeping. Some freaks of nature may be able to get by with less than 6 hours of sleep. Most need 7 - 8. We probably know those lazy teens who can seem to sleep all day. Some people might break up their sleep by sleeping for 4 hours, waking up to do something for a few hours and then going back down to sleep for another 4. Regardless, we all go through the same basic processes and have the same needs. Again, I think it really helps just to observe yourself and find out what works best for you. Experiment with many different ways and track that however you can. Maybe even just writing in a journal.<p>As for the side project, I meant working on a project for the employer.

7995765,comment,7992475,7993267,1,0,gavinking,,,"FTR, the whole declaration section vs initialization section stuff really boils down to this:<p><pre><code>    You can&#x27;t declare mutually-recursive methods before \n    initialization logic in the body of a class. You have to \n    declare them _after_ the fields of the class are fully \n    initialized.\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s not so hard to understand.<p>To see why it&#x27;s like this, you need to consider :<p>- Unlike most OO languages Ceylon statically _guarantees_ that a field of an object is initialized before it is accessed. (If we didn&#x27;t, then we would have to have something conceptually equivalent to a NullPointerException when you access a field before initialization.)\n- We&#x27;ve always hated the amazingly repeaty syntax of constructors in C++/C#/Java.<p>What I mean is, in Java I have to write stuff like:<p><pre><code>    class Point {\n        final float x; \n        final float y;\n        Point(float x, float y) {\n            this.x = x;\n            this.y = y;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn Ceylon, it would be:<p><pre><code>    class Point(Float x, Float y) {}\n</code></pre>\nAnd even with all that verbosity in the Java version, I _still_ don&#x27;t get a static guarantee that `x` and `y` are initialized before they are used by a method. This code prints `0.0`:<p><pre><code>    class Point {\n        final float x; \n        final float y;\n        Point(float x, float y) {\n            fun();\n            this.x = x;\n            this.y = y;\n        }\n        void fun() { System.out.println(x); }\n        public static final void main(String[] args) {\n            new Point(1.0f,2.0f);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo Ceylon wants to solve _both_ these problems: eliminate the verbosity, and provide the static checking for initialization. Now, this is an _almost_ completely transparent process. I almost never find myself thinking about declaration section vs initialization section. I just write classes so that fields are initialized before the methods that use them are declared. Which is basically super-intuitive. In >95% of classes that&#x27;s all you need to know. Very rarely, I mix this up, and the compiler complains and I need to move a member up or down. Which takes seconds to fix. Very, very rarely, I have a class with some kind of self-recursive initialization logic and then only in that case do I need to start holding the mental model of declaration-vs-initialization sections in my head. In practice, I think I&#x27;ve only run into this situation _once_, and it took me a few minutes to restructure the code. (FTR, it was `ArrayList` in `ceylon.collection`.)",1404680943

There are three major airports, run by separate agencies, and while regional housing policy is supposed to mandate that all municipalities provide their respective shares of housing demand, based on employment patterns, this is often undermined at the local level.

The monopoly position systemd currently enjoys has successfully been used to extend into a disturbing number of other components[1].<p>As for unix-vs-windows - switching to a windows-style binary log and rewriting an inetd into a mandatory &quot;SvcHost.exe&quot; for linux is bad enough, but the real issues is the removing of well-defined barriers between components.<p>Pottering&#x27;s hatred scripts is a problem, because using scripts as the &quot;glue&quot; in unix is one of the most important features of unix. Keeping many of the the interactions between components in an open and readable format has forced developers to create (and deal with) methods of API that can actually be extended beyond the original project. Systemd returns to the windows style of just making function calls into the current implementation. Being forced to, for example, listen on a unix socket for a command works easily with anything, even into the future. Requiring that same message be sent by calling some function encourages linking to extra libraries and makes interaction from scripts much more difficult.<p>This isn&#x27;t about any technical benefits; keeping the IPC between components open and well-defined is even more important than access to the source code itself if we are to maintain an ecosystem of Free Software. For those of us that would like to have a Free (as in freedom) Software ecosystem survive the current War On General Purpose Computing[2], the campaign by the pro-systemd people is, frankly, terrifying. Sometimes there are more important goals than &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;cleaner API&quot; or &quot;easier to write&quot;. Keeping the OS - both the kernel <i>and</i> system-utils - open, free, and interchangeable needs to be a high priority goal, or we will lose the progress the Free Software community has made over the last ~decade.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTczNDk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTczNDk</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nypRYpVKc5Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nypRYpVKc5Y</a>",1404680785

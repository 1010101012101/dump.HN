3256063,comment,3255757,3255954,3,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Exactly! Maybe this is a small minority being extra loud. Thank you for saving me a lot of typing.<p>Diversity for the sake of diversity hurts us all. You really do need to fix the underlying problems. I believe that there really are few qualified minority candidates for these jobs out there and there would be a lot more if we could fix some of the poverty and segregation that exists out there.<p>Black people in this country live in a separate America. They have their own culture as a result of past racism. So many black youth are living in these poor neighborhoods where they're learning that the only way to get ahead is to hussle in the bad sense of the word. Take a look at hip hop and the ideals being broadcast with that music. Make that money (however you can), trust no one, the world is against you. And it really is against them. Violence, crime, gangs, drugs, poverty. This is what a lot of minorities have to deal with growing up. If they manage to avoid the pitfalls of growing up that way they then have to adjust to a whole different world in college and beyond. If we can fix this issue then we'll have a lot more qualified minority candidates.<p>Look at pro sports. Why are so many star athletes black? Because they had no other way out. Meanwhile the suburban white kids have the luxury of living in a safe cul de sac where they can sit quietly and study or save up an allowance to pay the smart kid I'm the block to take his SAT.<p>Women are brought up to be these frail creatures and have heavy emphasis on things that won't help them become the career women we see in movies. There's a lot of talk about women's rights and equality but it isn't practiced as much as rhetoric is thrown around about it.<p>We as white males benefit greatly from White Privilege. It isn't our fault and we shouldn't feel guilty about it but we should recognize it and try to change it. The fact of the matter is that our culture and society is heaviily biased toward helping white men succeed with the ideals we're taught, the opportunities we're given, and just the way we're generally raised.<p>If we can extend White Privilege to everyone then we will have more diversity. There really is just less qualified minorities than whites in this industry and going out of our way to find a minority isn't helping anything. It just covers up a problem and leaves behind the greater issue. This needs to be addressed at the root.",1321732725

3256030,comment,3255510,3255937,5,0,palish,,,"Mm, fair point.  Although, ""geometric thinking"" wasn't a hindrance; check this out, it's pretty interesting:<p>For example we can visualize ""taking the derivative of the function f(x)"" by ""rolling a wheel over the top of its graph"":  <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/315/random_pics/derivative_wheel.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/315/random_pics/derivative_wheel.png</a><p>The red circle is a ""wheel"" which happily rolls back and forth along our f(x) graph.  The green line is the derivative of f(x).  It's intuitively obvious what that green line is -- if you had to fit a flat piece of paper between the wheel and where it touches the graph, then you'd get that line.  That's the derivative, also called the ""tangent line"" or ""slope of the graph"" at that point.<p>(The wheel will always touch the graph only once, because we can visualize it as small as we need it to be --- infinitely small, even.)<p>It's common knowledge that a curve's derivative is zero at its maximum / minimum. (In other words, ""when the wheel reaches the top or bottom of a 'hill', then its derivative is zero, aka the tangent line is perfectly horizontal"".) So right away, we immediately understand where the zeroes of the f'(x) graph must be located.<p>But the real power is, we also have a rough idea of how the f'(x) graph <i>must look</i>, by ""watching the wheel's tangent line as we roll it along the graph"", in our mind's eye.<p>So that's a neat trick, but why does it matter?<p>Well, here's one example:  It's the most natural and obvious thing in the world that the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x).<p><a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/315/random_pics/derivative_wheel_cos.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/315/random_pics/derivative_wheel_cos...</a><p>We start at x=0; we see that the wheel is ""resting on the very top of the slope"", meaning the tangent line is flat, so we know right off the bat that the derivative of cos(0) is 0.<p>From there, the wheel ""rolls downhill""; therefore the derivative ""goes negative""; and it goes back to zero when the wheel reaches the bottom of the hill (which we see is at x=pi).<p>The wheel then begins climbing uphill, so its derivative ""goes positive""; and it goes back to zero when the wheel reaches the top of the slope (at x=2pi).<p>So we see that the graph of the derivative of cos(x) has zeroes at 0, pi, and 2pi;  and we also intuitively understand that it's negative from 0 to pi; and we see that it's positive from pi to 2pi.<p>Now all that's left is to think about the graph of -sin(x). It's exactly what we just described: zero at x=0, x=pi, and x=2pi; negative from 0 to pi; and positive from pi to 2pi.  So that's why ""it's obvious to us that the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x)"", QED.<p>So if you've had to worry about rote memorizing those sorts of formulas, I'd urge you to give these visual techniques a shot.  You'll never again need to memorize seemingly-arbitrary equations, which is pretty sweet IMO.<p>Sorry for rambling on; I just get so excited about presenting math ""in a visual way"".  It's a lot of fun, and likely wouldn't hinder the ambitious mathematician at all --- just the opposite, in fact: Feynman, for example, had an arsenal of similar techniques, which probably contributed to his intuitive understanding of the physics behind the formulas and his ability to ""see past"" the raw equations.",1321731892

For example, a while back they would have been painters, another while back, they would have been writers, another while they would have been physicists, now they are technologists.

Of course opinions have no ""statistical weight"" (whatever that could possibly mean).  Only <i>data</i> has statistical significance.  So let's examine the data.

A video (hosted on YouTube, though I fail to see how that could possibly be relevant) of two individuals, one of whom claims to be a lawyer and another who claims to be a former police officer, both of whom say that it is unwise to talk to the police under any circumstances, and explain why in considerable detail.<p>2.  The well-documented fact that the Innocence Project has to date exonerated 280 people.<p>3.  The fact that Troy Davis was recently executed for a crime he almost certainly did not commit.<p>Are these data points statistically significant?  I have no idea.  I haven't done the math.  But 1) neither have you and 2) the burden of proof is not on me.  I am only arguing that it is not unreasonable to be wary of law enforcement.  If someone wants to dispute that, the burden is on them to show that law enforcement is trustworthy.  So far no one participating in this discussion has offered up EVEN A SINGLE DATA POINT in support of that position.

Past racism may have hurt their parents' socioeconomic prospects, forcing them to be born in an economically depressed ghetto with poor schools and gang violence. Even if there's no racism past that point, if their parents were prevented from ascending to the middle class, they won't pass on middle-class virtues emphasizing the importance of education. No matter how good the schools are, they don't really work the same without positive parental involvement.<p>And there's obstacles to how good the schools are, too--good teachers will be scared away by the violence and gang activity that's common in those environments, and district-based taxing, funding, and student allocation procedures mean that kids in those areas are trapped in bad schools. If the school system is racist on top of that, that's even another barrier.<p>If you don't fix something that's that bad when the kid is five years old, by the time they're eighteen and getting out of high school, let's suppose they go to college. Okay, the colleges do everything they can not to be racist, but it's genuinely harder to meet academic standards for admission if you went to shitty schools your whole life. And even if you get in, you have to compete with the students who went to better schools and got a better start. That's a barrier against even getting into difficult academic tracks like STEM. And if the university system is racist, that's even another barrier.<p>Okay, the job market for developers is pretty good right now even in startups. It probably isn't even racist. But even at this point, all the forces I've already described have thinned out the numbers to the point where a disproportionately small minority of the genuinely qualified population of entry-level developers are, well, minorities. But let's say the job market is racist, too.<p>Once you're ready to found a startup, it's absolutely true that the pool of candidates coming to YC and others for funding is genuinely unbalanced. Even if investors do everything they can to be perfectly non-racist, racism in any or all of the levels previous to this in the person's life is going to take them out of the population of qualified startup founders. And no matter what you do to fix investment, it's not going to restore the proportion of minority startup founders to the proportion of minorities in the population.

Well we are starting to raise our seed round and raised a round already from and are about to graduate from the GreenStart Cleantech Accelerator Program in San Francisco that had a 3% acceptance rate.<p>Here is how the equity deal works: say our web/mobile/front-end development would normally cost us $10k. We give you 2x that or $20k worth of stock (50% upfront, 50% upon completion with the option to buy it back within 30 days in cash) and then when we raise our seed round it will be valued another 2x at $40k. That is a 4x return within a few months in a young startup that is at the beginning of its growth curve. After Series A 12 months out that original $10k that be worth 40x or $400k. If we are so lucky to grow like a weed and raise a B then that could be worth 400x and you are a multi millionaire. You are basically taking the same risk as YC or any VC. If you did this 5-10 times (as I am sure you know) you would come out on top, both with experience and valuable stock.<p>So what do we do? WA.TT is a fun, simple and social consumer application that helps people save money on their energy and go green. Think of it as a mashup of Zynga & Mint for energy. Our demographic spends $800b on energy and related products every year, that is a big market and it is rapidly changing as we move towards a resource constrained and warming world. We are building the social energy platform that manages all of a consumers energy data, gives personalized recommendations on how to save up to 20% on their energy and manages consumers home appliances as they get ""smarter"". We make it fun by adding in a game and social layer on top of our energy analytics and<p>We have a kick-ass team of a back-end developer, business hustler and designer. You are the missing link that can add the spark to take us into orbit.<p>The magic of our technology is that after a 60-second signup, consumers can see all of their energy in one simple location. We track it over time automatically providing a tight feedback loop.<p>Interested? Contact me ASAP at james@wa.tt",1321729643

Some date back to the semi-independence of medieval universities, which weren't supposed to be harassed by the local authorities; others are more recent laws, e.g. Greece's ""university asylum"" law was a reaction to police raids on campuses by the '67-'74 military dictatorship.<p>The U.S. doesn't have any particular no-police-on-campus rules, although they <i>do</i> have an interesting arrangement in many cases, including this one, where the campus police have been upgraded to ""real"" police, and non-university police are not usually allowed on campus, because it's not in their jurisdiction. How they relate to the university administration tends to be complex, but the goal is to make some mixture of a regular police force and a campus-security force: more ""official"" than only a campus security force, but university-controlled, like a campus-security force would be, as opposed to having city-controlled police on campus.<p>It <i>usually</i> actually works pretty well, I think. Incidents like this are a lot less common than they might be with a regular police force, and many campus police have a geniune interest in keeping campuses calm and defusing confrontations. Even in this video, you can see that only one cop is really acting out of line, and many of the others look a bit uncomfortable with what's going on (especially when he's taking other cops' bottles of pepper spray to go back for more).",1321729333

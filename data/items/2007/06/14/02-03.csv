27982,comment,27490,27981,0,0,knewjax,,,"Thank you for the input staunch. I def agree with everything you said. I also think its good to set goals for yourself and think well into the future, even though most of your original ideas and plans will end up far from where you had anticipated. <p>""Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.""",1181788484
27981,comment,27490,27581,0,0,staunch,,,"I think he's totally wrong and what davidw said about focus is right on. It's easy to generalize any idea, but most of the time it just leads to mediocrity. Force the expansion out of your mind until you've completely dominated your current target. By then you'll probably see much better ways to expand than this obvious generalization.<p>",1181787946

When something is deleted, it really goes away.  This is different from marking something as dead.  You can still see dead stuff if you set showdead to yes.<p>Deletion is for submitters who change their mind; marking stuff as dead is for editors to do to spams and offtopic submissions.",1181787300

27977,comment,27773,27958,0,0,zach,,,"Sadly, I haven't found a good roundup yet.   Everyone seems to use phpAdsNew or MMM.  I'm frankly surprised at the lack of innovation in this area, given the growth in niche-market websites.<p>Why is there nobody that simply hosts an ad server for you for a monthly fee?  They don't even have to handle the payments, just having them act as an independent analytics provider would be plenty.  In the age of S3, this is way easy stuff.  Come on, someone do this!",1181786991

27975,comment,27864,27866,0,0,lkozma,,,"I think those ""special"" schools are even worse, because you kind of put pressure on them to be creative. I think regular schools are best if not taken too seriously. Kids will learn despite the system anyway, not because of it.",1181786728
27974,comment,27972,27973,0,0,willarson,,,"A) Graham (as in Grahamcrackers)<p>B) The problem is that just as business types are bad at evaluating hackers, hackers are bad at evaluating business types. No one wants to work with someone awful, and the best chance hackers have at avoiding that is to work with people they know how to judge--other hackers.<p>The issue is not that hackers hate working with business people, its that they hate working with people who are not good at what they do. Given this they use the only proficiency they have--programming--to evaluate people they'll be investing a year or five in.<p>When a friend of mine proposes a new programming project, I am often really excited about it and can't wait to get working on it; when someone who isn't a programmer proposes ideas its a lot less pleasant because they don't understand the constraints of programming. <p>When non-programmer Jimmy suggests an idea what it is that Jimmy thinks it would be cool if someone else made this idea into reality and let him profit on it. When a hacker suggests an idea they are saying ""lets build this together."" Who in their right mind would pick the former if they have a choice?",1181786541

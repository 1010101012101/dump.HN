256253,comment,256176,256176,0,0,aaco,,,"This is a great reading.<p>I didn't read it all so far (but I will), but I think if people were taught mathematics in a more explanatory way there would be a lot more of them interested in it, and therefore interested in areas related to it, or at least we wouldn't have a society so afraid of it.<p>It's amazing how many people don't know the very basics of it like, for instance, how multiplication is just a compact way of expressing a repetitive sum. And things like that happen because they were trying to <i>remember</i> numbers and formulas instead of <i>understanding</i> the concept.<p>It's just hard to forget about a concept, which gives the basis to understanding more complex things. I think maths teaching would be more productive if we spent more time elaborating on why things are done in some way (or how to come up with a concept just by reasoning about it, without doing calculations and writing symbols on paper) than trying to teach more complex concepts for someone who doesn't understand the basics, and therefore won't grasp the complex ones.<p>There's clearly something wrong about teaching maths, and very likely other subjects too, or maybe something wrong about teaching (anything).",1216956541

However, I HATE it when games (often puzzle games) use red and green color coding.  I see them as distinct colors, but for certain shades, the contrast between them is very slight, which makes the game a lot more difficult and frustrating.<p>I guess it's one of those things where if no one on the team suffers from it, they have no real reason to consider it.",1216956490

256243,comment,255573,255573,0,0,Mystalic,,,"Let me give you some analysis:<p>- Interesting concept, video is slowly gaining ground, so it seems like a natural evolution from Twitter.  WITH that said, 
- The design does need work - it's simple, which is good, but it's unappealing.
- Good front pitch on the site, but not great - it needs to be more interesting.
- You need to justify WHY I should take the extra time to hook up a webcam and record my 12 second snippet than just Tweet it - this seems like too much time for something as simple as a status update.   Convince me this is a better method and just as easy and you'll get customers. 
- Trot out the appealing people.  We're a very physically-minded society, the cute girls and interesting guys will get you hits, maybe even a viral one. 
- Great job on TechCrunch!  I'll keep watch.  And yes, I'd enjoy an invite (ben@benparr.com)",1216956146

Eugenics is just a straightforward application of basic genetics, and has been demonstrated to work in humans and other animals exactly as the theory describes. There may be some engineering issues, but many human traits can be modified by eugenics.",1216955985

When I use the word ""academia"", I usually mean ""getting a job that's on the career path to becoming a tenured professor, at least in theory"".<p>If that's what you're asking about, I can talk about that, although my first advice will be to forget all about it. ;) But that's not what I'm recommending in the post above. I'm not even recommending going to grad school for the credential, exactly. I'm recommending going to grad school because it's a great, society-approved excuse to quit your job, get the hell out of your cubicle, take some interesting classes, do some small and interesting projects (either for school or on the side) with a bunch of other smart people who have similar interests, and change the direction of your resume.<p>(There are obviously other ways to accomplish the goal of changing your career's direction, and one of those might be better. But this particular scenario -- a person who feels trapped by their own job history -- just smelled to me like someone who might prefer the grad school route. It's a fairly safe, classic, and well-respected way to mix your life up a bit for a year or two.)",1216955456

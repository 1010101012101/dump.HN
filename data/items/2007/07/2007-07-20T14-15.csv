My monthly food bill (when I'm not skimping) is typically second only to rent and taxes.<p>Consider- 1/4 a box of that barilla pasta I mentioned... 400 calories costs maybe $0.50.  Add sauce and you're maybe up to 500 calories and $1.00 for the meal.  Drink water, or maybe a cup of gatorade for another $0.50.  A meal for around $2.00.  Cereal for breakfast is probably similar, $2.00-$2.50 per meal.<p>Ruling out breakfast, consider 2 meals a day for a month.  At $2 for lunch and $2 for dinner for 31 days, that's $124/mo.  A $7 lunch and a $10 dinner is $527/mo.  In 3 months you'll have saved $1,200.",1184943493

A concrete example: Scandinavian heath care might fall apart in the US from corruption -- something that isn't a problem so much there.<p>I'm not saying socialism is a good idea, even in Europe.",1184943470

You're wrong, wrong, wrong!""<p>Seriously, would you want this guy making a few million?  Not only would he be a douche, but he'd be a rich douche.  Imagine how he'd treat his waitresses and waiters then.  Or his local cops.  Or anyone not as smart as he is, which is, apparently, EVERYONE.  I'd even call him a detriment to our society, because the child just seems to act like a Paris Hilton with brains.  Smart people can be civil, and it's just silly to watch everyone go ""Cperciva you're so awesome!  You should do X with your life!"" and him go ""Oh ho ho, didn't you think I already considered that?  I turned down a headhunter yesterday, in fact.  Now go make me a sandwich.""<p>The dude's a genius, but he could learn a little humility.  But he's obviously not going to learn until some event wakes him up to it, so I'm done caring that maybe one more nice person could exist in the world.",1184943224

35602,comment,34973,35185,0,0,Goladus,,,"I recommend multi-grain pasta (Barilla seems to be good enough and very tasty).  Lots of protein and complex carbs, some vitamins, and fiber.  More expensive than regular pasta, but with tomato sauce it's still around a buck or two a meal (depends on how much you eat of course).<p>More hassle to prepare than Ramen, but not by much.",1184941940

Today you didn't jump out of bed because you were sleeping at your desk.  You responded (3 hours later) to a text message your wife sent you asking if you were going to make it home tonight.  You're not worrying about conquering the world today anymore, you're worried about how you're going to pay your mortgage tomorrow. <p>What the hell happened?<p>The Road is Longer than it Appears<p>The first mistake you made was convincing yourself and those around you that it would only be tough for a year.  Startups take a long time to become successful, and even though you may read about one that grew quickly, most do not. <p><pre><code>    You need to recalibrate.  Set your horizons for a 3-year window, not a 12 month window.  
</code></pre>
Realize that it may be longer than that.  It's a startup career, not a startup project.<p>Spend Less Now<p>If you were like most, you tried to maintain your lifestyle while you eased into your startup world. That doesn't happen.  That's like trying to go camping and bitching about not having Air Conditioning in your tent.  You're in the wild, you need to rough it.<p>To do that, you need to cut every last expense you have, and then cut some more. <p><pre><code>    If you haven't figured it out by now, I can tell you first hand that things are going to get worse (financially) before they get better.  
</code></pre>
It's time to trade down into a cheaper car, refinance the house (think: ""interest only""), and put the kibosh on any idea of a vacation.  It's not in the cards.<p>Remember Why You're Here<p>You're not giving up your social life for a paycheck.  When you started this company it was about more than just a big check (right?). <p><pre><code>    You started this company because you were passionate about blazing your own trail.  You're doing it right now, and it's hard.  But don't forget why you made this decision.
</code></pre>
Remember today that you're not listening to your idiot boss make horrible decisions and hide in his bureaucratic bunker.  You're not working like a slave to make some CEO who doesn't even know your name.  You're taking control of your own destiny, and guess what - sometimes that's a very rocky road.",1184941510

Also, Enron behaved in criminally fraudulent ways, which for a business, is the beginning of the end.  So Enron does not provide a free market comparison.",1184941502

Then again, it looks like universal healthcare will be at least an interesting side-story in the upcoming US presidential race. Perhaps socialism is finding some roots in US politics.",1184940550
35591,comment,35564,35588,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Hmm, how do you do socialism better?  Germany, as propsperous as it is, has chronically high unemployment (from 10% up to 20% in some areas) and a huge crisis right now with funding their version of social security (which they are unable to do.)  What is really impressive about the Germans is that they actually look at the money they have and think about how that money is spent (in the public realm and private realm) instead of the smoke and mirrors we get here about how much something will cost and how it will be funded.  Germans like precision, especially with money, even government money which is great to see, but does not solve the underlying impossibility of success with socialism.  Germany is successful to the extent that it is capitalist - the socialist side is what prevents Germany from being as impressive as it should be.",1184940540

article, simply don't understand what we do.   If all we did

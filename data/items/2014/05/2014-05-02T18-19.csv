Tell me, how do I know what types of resources are available, and what parameters they accept?<p>The structure is overwrought, the &quot;GET for all actions&quot; is INCREDIBLY dangerous, the entire thing is INCREDIBLY vulnerable to all kinds of attack vectors (no, I don&#x27;t think &quot;don&#x27;t use cookies&quot; is an acceptable solution to the problem).

7687453,comment,7686816,7687182,2,0,hcarvalhoalves,,,"I&#x27;ve been working with Django for 5 years. In my experience, Django&#x27;s ORM is pretty good for the common cases (specially when your query maps one-to-one to a single model), but for anything that you need a bit more flexibility (dealing with scalars, GROUP BY, a custom JOIN) you&#x27;re on your own with raw SQL, which gets unmaintainable quickly since you can&#x27;t chain it with QuerySet and suddenly you&#x27;re not compatible with the rest of the codebase.<p>SQLAlchemy is more interesting in that it doesn&#x27;t hide SQL away, just provides an API for it. Underneath everything you&#x27;re still dealing with strings (you can just print most objects, like queries, columns, expressions, SQL functions, etc), so you&#x27;re less likely to be suddenly incompatible with the rest of the API when doing something that deviates a little more from the common cases.",1399057093

7687443,comment,7686774,7686964,3,0,squeaky-clean,,,"This reminds me of an experiment my music teacher did with my class in grade school. I&#x27;d completely forgot about it until just now, and thinking back, it may have been one of the things that influenced me to become a programmer.<p>He was trying to teach us the idea of explaining yourself more clearly (he was one of those teachers that went off on tangents totally unrelated to music when he felt there was an important life-lesson other classes might not cover). He stood at the board and told us that he would draw whatever we said, and the goal was to have him write out a musical staff and certain notes on the chalkboard with no physical gestures, just talking. As if we were having a conversation over the phone. He went around the room giving every child a turn at a time.<p>So it starts off &quot;Ok, draw 5 lines.&quot;<p>And he gets a piece of paper and drew 5 horizontal lines.<p>&quot;No! No! On the board!&quot;, said the next one.<p>So he goes to the chalkboard and draws 5 lines in random places.<p>&quot;No! No! make them horizontal!&quot;<p>And he drew 5 horizontal lines that squiggled around and were of random lengths.<p>And this went on and on until you we ended up with something like &quot;On the chalkboard draw 5 straight horizontal lines, about 1 inch apart, and all 2 feet long.&quot; And then we still had to figure out how to explain drawing in notes on the correct line, whether the circle was filled or un-filled (quarter note, half note, etc).<p>We never actually finished, most of the kids got too bored. But I thought that was such a fun lesson. Almost 15 years later I can still recall it as clearly as if it were last week. I&#x27;ve had a few intro programming or algorithms teachers explain a similar concept. A robot baking cakes is a common one, or that programmer joke (&quot;buy butter and if they have eggs then buy a dozen.&quot;), but actually shouting commands someone as inept as a computer really made it sink in.",1399057015

Sure we&#x27;d all like to work at those places. That&#x27;s the problem.<p>If you pick any company that is generally off the public radar (and not being fawned over in the press with a celebrity CEO) it is quite possible to send a postal letter to the CEO and have a fair shot of getting a summer job. Or even an email but my feeling is a letter would get more attention and seem more genuine.<p>Not all the value lies in the usual suspects that have more applicants than they can handle.<p>A corollary to this goes with low paid jobs. Our offices used to be located near a Walmart. Yet not one time in 9 years to anyone ever come through the door looking for an office or admin or warehouse job. Yet everyday people showed up at the Walmart and got a much lower paying job and (from our pov) much worse working conditions.

7687355,comment,7684163,7684163,1,0,dap,,,"The paper ignores what I think is one of the biggest advantages of event-based systems over threaded ones, which is that the pathological failure modes when things go operationally sideways are often much nicer with event-based systems.  It&#x27;s not just that threaded code is &quot;harder&quot; -- as others have pointed out, event-based code is hard in a different way.  But when you make a network call with a lock held, you not only block the operation in question, but anything else which needs the same lock, or which would like to use the same thread.  The worst part it is that it will work most of the time -- until that network call blocks for a long time for some reason, at which point latency bubbles propagate through the application.  With an event-based system in an environment that doesn&#x27;t allow you to block the event loop without going <i>way</i> out of your way (as Node.js does, for example), the operation in question will obviously stop until the network call completes, but that won&#x27;t affect anything that&#x27;s not intrinsically tied to that call.<p>A related failure mode I&#x27;ve seen a lot is when an operation gets stuck with a lock held and you can&#x27;t even call into the server to ask the status of the operation because <i>that</i> request blocks on the lock that&#x27;s held.  Of course, the better way to do this is to avoid holding the lock during a blocking operation, and instead use the lock only to set a flag indicating the operation is pending.  That way, other threads can observe the current state while the operation is pending.  The point is that you have to make these intermediate states explicit.  But IMO, that&#x27;s the hardest part of the event-based system anyway.",1399056112

Since I&#x27;m the same way, I always held him in high regard. Unlike most CEOs (low-variance, reliably mediocre types) he had the courage to be different. I really liked the idea of a CEO who had a genuine personality (even a difficult one) over the typical corporate social climber.<p>The more that comes out about Jobs, the more I think of him as not only slimy, but toxic. He seems to have set the template for a thousand talentless hacks who use his success as an excuse to be unethical.<p><i>Mr. Jobs’s conduct is a reminder that the difference between genius and potentially criminal behavior can be a fine line.</i><p>This makes no sense. I&#x27;m one of those high-amplitude individuals. It comes with great difficulty. Most highly creative people have some kind of (possibly mild) mental illness: bipolar&#x27;s a common one.

Ultimately every program is going to increase in complexity-- that quote about failure vs legacy nightmare applies here.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s better to reduce the complexity of the language to a minimum so that language/runtime complexity doesn&#x27;t have a multiplicative effect on application code complexity.<p>For instance, C++ is a complex language. That complexity inevitably accrues to applications written in C++. This is a conscious trade-off of the language -- performance + high level programming, or what have you.<p>In the end, though, I am not sure I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s much correlation between simplicity of the language and simplicity of the code. It&#x27;s too hard to get anyone to agree on what simple means anyway. Me, I prefer Hickey&#x27;s &quot;Simple Made Easy&quot; for that, but not everyone agrees.<p>ETA: I guess what I would say is: would you prefer to start with something simpler and build complexity appropriate to the problem domain out of simple, but sound ideas? Or would you prefer to start with a set of inherently complex primitives and build something <i>else</i> complex on top of that?

7687315,comment,7687227,7687227,4,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"tl;dr: Comparing the size of two or more economies, e.g., China and the US, is fraught with peril. Traditional comparison tools, such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are neither precise nor accurate and involve considerable nuance. More recent tools such as PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) give the appearance of validity and reliability since they appear to have greater precision - but no one, perhaps least of all the economists using them - can make advance sufficiently meaningful claims as to their accuracy. In other words, PPP may be just as flawed and just as nuanced as GDP. Or it may not. No one really knows.<p>So take with a grain of salt any claims that the Chinese economy is set to overtake the US economy. It may be about to do so. It may not. It may have already done so. It might never do so.<p>Whether or not it does, did, or never will cannot be reliably established with GDP or PPP or any other tools yet known to economists.<p>On a personal note, I&#x27;d assert that just as currency strength is a measure of faith in an economy, so goes the importance of whether one economy is perceived as larger than another, with the same vicious/virtuous circle implications: If the Chinese economy is perceived as larger the US and likely to yet larger get, then speculators will put their money in China and remove it from the US, with virtuous and vicious implications for the two economies. Alternatively, if China and the US are perceived as being of a size, then both will for a time rise and fall with the perception of whether or not their being of a size is a good thing or not. In other words, why isn&#x27;t China growing, let&#x27;s put our money in the US, both are growing, both are fair picks, both are stagnating, Europe looks good, etc.",1399055601

7687287,comment,7686039,7686039,21,0,zackmorris,,,"Converting sunlight to heat is trivial, at 1368 watts per square meter.  The problem has always been energy storage.  A single acre is 4047 square meters, or 5.54 MW (7429 hp).  As a rule of thumb, I generally divide the area by 3 because collectors are usually arranged in troughs, slightly spaced for low sun angles.  Still, thinking in terms of 1 MW of heat per acre, or 2000 hp, puts things in perspective.  Dams and power plants are usually in the GW range, so it would take 33x33 acres to capture 1 GW of heat.  Since an acre is  about 209 feet on a side, that&#x27;s between 1 and 2 square miles.  At the quoted 1.73% efficiency, we&#x27;d have to multiply by the inverse, 58, to convert from heat to fuel.  So we&#x27;re talking 50-100 square miles to create the output of a GW power plant for say 8 hours of daylight.  Figure a 200 square mile plant to withdraw 1 GW worth of fuel continuously.  However, we get down to the 20-40 square mile range if they can get the efficiency to 10%.  Of course this all ignores the combustion efficiency which is probably only about 25% so we have to multiply by a factor of 4 again.<p>Probably a more practical way to store energy, and in my mind the most likely way to power vehicles, is compressed air at 300-700 atmospheres, which is within the same order of magnitude energy/mass density as batteries, depending on the storage tank:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density</a><p>A solar plant can be built on top of an empty natural gas well and store energy in compressed air underground.  Another possibility is compressed air in large bags at the bottom of the ocean, that would displace less water than a dam since the height difference can be several thousand feet (pumping water uphill is not very effective due to the elevation required).  We’ll also never have enough batteries or supercapacitors to store that much energy.<p>I wish I had money to invest in fiberglass or carbon fiber wrapped storage tanks and micro turbines/pistons that convert the energy in compressed air to rotational energy.  I think we’ll be using them instead of something more exotic like magnetic bearing flywheels, and future electric cars will have a small natural gas/hydrogen turbine that tops off an air tank that will take the car 10 or 20 miles without having to tap into batteries.  Also, refilling air tanks at a fueling station can happen almost instantly, at least as fast as filling up with gasoline.<p>Still, I think making hydrocarbons is an exciting development for distributed generation, where people are only making a few liters of fuel a day from water basically.  I imagine that it might be more efficient to make propane also, and this is a little off topic but propane engines are much easier to build/more efficient because they don’t have carburetors or fuel injection.  I’m honestly surprised the world went with gasoline and diesel, although it was probably for safety reasons.",1399055256

The fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts, and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning.<p>4. The joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task.<p>5. The delight of working in such a tractable medium.

To hopefully express what I&#x27;m saying more clearly: Assume your open strings on a guitar are tuned perfectly in the standard way: the A string is 110 Hz, the low E string is 110 * 2^-5/12 Hz, the D string is 110 * 2^5/12 Hz, and so forth. This will allow you to play an in-tune E minor chord on the open strings, but other chords will not be in tune (again, with reference to the equally-tempered pitch space) to the same degree because of the fact that the strings have different densities and widths. You could imagine accounting for this by tuning the strings such that some other chord was in tune, but then your original E minor chord would no longer be in tune. Thus my point that even though the guitar&#x27;s design is predicated on equal temperament, it still requires per-key adjustments to be in tune for an arbitrary chord, unless you&#x27;re using one of the guitars I linked to above.",1399054800

7687178,comment,7684752,7685529,1,0,dirkgently,,,"A very simple (or simplified) example could be - say you have just one table - a transaction table from a local deli shop with a volume of around 500 transactions / day, and all you are doing with it is producing a report of how many items of each type (sugar/salt/bread) is sold. Say, you produced this report on daily, monthly and yearly basis. You decided to use, say, just a spreadsheet, which is sufficient to store this data, as well as running the calculation using pivot tables. This works for a year.<p>The shop is now more popular, and a bit bigger too. The volume increases to say 2000 transactions a day, and you say, well, let&#x27;s use mysql to store this. You are still comfortably generating the report at the end of the year using simple sql queries.<p>Now suddenly, they decide go really big, to expand and open more stores across the city or state, say about 500 stores. They also expand the items in the stores from just few hundreds to few thousands. They project the transactions across all stores to be in the range of 1,000,000, on average containing about 10 items in each. They also want more reports on which products are doing good/bad, what are the buying habits, what&#x27;s the trend over Thanksgiving, do year-to-year comparisons on various matrix. And the mysql solution no longer works - storing 10,000,000 rows on daily basis and running those sql queries is turning out to be practically impossible. In a year, you now have 3,650,000,000 rows that needs to be joined with 100,000 items. Yes, you can add more space and more resources to the machine, but running all those queries are now taking hours or days instead of seconds.<p>This is the point where Hadoop/Map-Reduce comes to rescue.  You now have a cluster of, say, 5 machines, each having, say, 64G or RAM and 1 PB of storage, but still costing just around 25000$.<p>Since you are not familiar with Java or Map - Reduce, and/or don&#x27;t have time to learn it, you decide to use Hive - an important tool of the Hadoop ecosystem among others - that still let&#x27;s you access and process the data in the familiar sql query way - but generating map-reduce jobs on your behalf on the nodes. They split the processing across different nodes, bring required outputs together, may run through other map-reduce jobs if required, and ultimately, give you the results that you can use produce those reports - in a reasonable time, of course.<p>This is very simplified but real-life business use case.",1399054063

My integration phase lasts about an hour, compared to weeks for others.<p>That&#x27;s what a real &quot;10x&quot; programmer is: someone who follows practices, cares about re-use and doesn&#x27;t need to re-invent the wheel. If a cowboy coder claims to be a 10x programmer, he&#x27;s probably the reason everyone else is only a 1x programmer.",1399053634

For example I&#x27;m sure EventBrite calls their events directory &quot;promotion&quot; so I think your paid services need to be more explicitly spelled out.  I agree if you are going to compete with EB you are going to have to do something drastic and with ticketmaster holding contracts with all the large venues it will be very interesting to see if this takes off or just destroys value in the industry.",1399053627

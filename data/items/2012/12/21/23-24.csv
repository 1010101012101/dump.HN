4955176,comment,4952486,4953720,3,0,GregBuchholz,,,"It seems like there needs to be a litigation insurance aspect to this as well.  A policy which would cover the costs of just the lawyers, not the costs of any settlements or judgement awards.  How much would the premium be for a policy that offers $100,000 of protection with a $5,000 deductible and a 10% copay?  The first response letter would be free.  The more specific the coverage, it would seem to make the premium.  So this would be for patent infringment lawsuits only.  And maybe the upper cap is increased to $200,000 for cases filed in East Texas.<p>Here are the benefits as I see when the troll come-a-calling:<p>- For those with the insurance: ""Yay, we now have some breathing room, since we're lawyered-up, and most of it is paid for.""\n- For those with out the insurance.  They'd still want to hire the ""Anti-troll LLC"" company for the litigation, since the trolls wouldn't know if the insurance policy was in effect, and would have to assume that they have a real fight on their hands.\n- If ""Anit-troll LLC"" was popular enough, it would also seem to be a partial end-run around the NDA thing, since the same law firm is involved, and the same lawyers are involved in multiple cases.",1356134308

GTD allows me to dedicate uninterrupted time for ""deep work"" precisely because I know that there is dedicated time and place for dealing with ""shallow"" work and it's take out of the way. Allen himself writes about not being to do everything, for me it means that there should be conscious  effort to limit amount of ""shallow work"" you do and may be decide not to do some items at all. In other word if all you time goes to ""shallow work"", then you prioritized your projects wrong.<p>Also, GTD book is one of the most badly written books, the style is watery, and just hard to get through. It could be compressed threefold without the loss of meaning. I opted out for audio version which I could listen to on faster speed. This is a pity that invaluable advise comes in such package, recently I started to re-read, but now thinking about trying to reading some of this ""GTD Summary"" books instead. I wish somebody would buy license from Allen to rewrite it in digestible, concise way.<p>Also, I was using (and paying for) RTM for years for my list keeping, but it's just not optimized for GTD and web UI needs long-required update. Nirvana HQ finally got smartphone client, I switched to it and it's really good. Nirvana's web UI is well structured, compared to RTM it needs better keyboard shortcuts and group operations, but overall it's much easier to use for GTD than RTM.",1356133844

And unlike Windows, the GNU core has a ton of software written that runs on it already, and thanks to being open source and compiled against GCC, this stuff rarely has large issues besides performance running on ARM.<p>I only say Ubuntu because it seems Canonical is the only market force trying to push a GNU os commercially.

The first is whether the TSA's procedures would help a prevent 9/11-style hijackings.  I think everyone agrees that the TSA doesn't add much value in the single hijacker case, simply because passengers can probably overpower a single hijacker.<p>If the number of hijackers increases to, say, a dozen, then perhaps the TSA might help here, because a dozen men in the front of the plane armed with sufficient weapons might be able to hold off the rest of the cabin, and getting a sufficient number of <i>serious</i> weapons (and door-openers) though security might be too risky to make such an attack worthwhile.  After all, a dozen terrorists might be more profitably used elsewhere.<p>The second question is whether the TSA's more onerous policies, like use of full-body scanners and bans on liquids, prevent fatal bombings of airliners (not hijackings).  Clearly terrorists are not only interested in using planes as weapons, but simply causing them to crash by, say, detonating a bomb from the restroom.

Also keep in mind that Intel doesn't need to charge $200 to make a profit. The current Atom chips are price competitive with ARM based alternatives. The Atom parts aren't quite up to par with an A15 based part yet but I think it'd be foolish to count Intel out.<p>The primary cost of a SoC is manufacturing. Process advantages mean that you have access to cheaper transistors that have better performance and power characteristics. The easiest way to improve the ratio of performance to anything in microprocessors has always been to make it smaller. There have been far too many words wasted on the role of instruction sets and architectures. Those things matter but that's the easy part. The hard part is getting a meaningful advantage in the manufacturing side, which is what Intel has. This is precisely why AMD is dying. They can't even undercut Intel because Global Foundries is so far behind Intel that they physically can't produce an equivalent product for less despite Intel's ~60% margins.<p>I think what you will see is Intel getting more aggressive in the mobile space in the next couple years because they are going to want to ensure that TSMC doesn't get a chance to catchup.

A Facebook-owned Instagram already made people nervous. This change in ToS brought back memories of other unpleasant changes.<p>2nd Edit - Munroe's comic ends with the idea that it's useless to complain or drop the service.

E.g. Imagine that you are faced with a task that essentially requires you to write a small compiler, but that is not obvious from the outset. If you are a smart and productive web dev, but you have never studied or written compilers, you can easily spend a few weeks with the task until you realize that you need to study compiler tech and write one to solve problem well. You can easily spend a few months with the whole endeavor. On the otherhand, an experienced 10x dev who has written many mini-compilers for DSLs in his career, can spot the need immediately and implement it in a few days. And on the otherhand, a less gifted individual can spend two years with the problem in his safe corporate job and never solve the problem. Here you already have infinite difference in the productivity between the best and the worst and easily 25x productivity between smart web dev and the experienced guy.<p>Now, you can argue that was just one specific problem, but one commonality of 10x programmers is that they have done a lot of different kind of programming, which makes them faster to try even more stuff so their experience is accumulating even faster.",1356130941

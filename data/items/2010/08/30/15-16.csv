They require different skill sets.  Founding CEOs are likely do eschew processes and do things themselves when necessary and nobody else is around to do it.  Fortune 500 CEOs are likely to insist on processes and delegate any work that needs to be done.<p>Also, startup CEOs cannot afford to surround themselves with people who are aren't as smart or smarter than themselves.  With limited resources and capital, everybody needs to pull their own weight.  A startup's success is not guaranteed, so every advantage helps.  In a Fortune 500 company, the company is most likely not going to disappear anytime soon.

Nevertheless, I have observed that the rules of workplace status differ between the two organizations. Actually, the rules of workplace status differ in every organization as the leader sets the tone. However, since we are generalizing, I wanted to express my thoughts to see what people thought.<p>Steve Blank describes this as a competition vs collaboration model. I think it's better to take it to the school yard and it's about play fighting vs. social belongingness which are each expensive strategies that require total investment and exclude each other.<p>Men (let's say) usually play fight to determine the pecking order. Aggression for men is like a status bubble sort: continuously comparing and swapping status with your peers. This strategy consumes energy continuously, but transactionally.<p>Women (let's say) often mistake play aggression for real aggression and respond inappropriately, thereby losing the game.<p>Women (let's say) have a different status game. While it's usually described as building relationships, I think that's not quite it play fighters build relationships too. The other game is about constantly demonstrating support of other people around you. This is more like neural networks: reinforce connections or prune them. This strategy also consumes energy continuously, but over time.<p>Men (let's say) often make a mistake of not responding correctly and come off as insensitive.<p><i>If we are truthfully generalizing</i>, none of this really matters since every leader is different so you'll have to adapt skillfully to your situation. Trust me: gender is not a true signal of which strategy is in play.<p>Lessons:<p>1. Learn how to be acutely aware to your organization's status game and play accordingly.<p>2. When you're in power, make sure you create a productive status game and enforce accordingly.",1283182928

Specifically, Diaspora says that you'll be in charge of your data and that it will be ""encrypted at every leg"".  The problem is that I can't see how Diaspora will address those issues (and I'll explain why).<p>First, they say that they're going to put you in charge of your data.  If you post something that you want to take back, you can delete it.  However, how would that work on a distributed network?  Let's say that you use Goodbook and I use Ultrabook and we're friends.  I post something on Ultrabook and Goodbook grabs it to show in your newsfeed.  Then I delete it from Ultrabook - it was embarrassing. Goodbook still has it stored.  You can have a good-faith ""please delete this"" but that doesn't stop another party from keeping it.  So, there's actually little control that one can exert over their data in a distributed network and it relies on us trusting not only the provider we've chosen, but the providers of all our friends.<p>Second, the end-to-end encryption promised doesn't seem so likely.  For example, if Goodbook grabs my status in encrypted form and they can unencrypt it, that doesn't make the encryption worth anything.  For encryption to be worth something, it needs to be unencrypted by the end user.  However, I don't see how they'd do that.  Browsers don't integrate this functionality and one could write a plugin, but that's a big barrier to adoption.  I could store my public key with my Ultrabook account and then Goodbook could push your status updates to me encrypted with my public key that I could then decrypt using my private key, but that seems like it wouldn't be the most seam-less experience without additional software.<p>That also ignores the much larger storage cost of storing a message encrypted once for each friend you want to send it to (say, 500 times) rather than storing it one time for everyone, but that's a scaling problem that could be overcome.<p>If another service provider can unencrypt the updates, you're in a worse position than with Facebook.  Right now, I only have to worry about Facebook being evil.  In that scenario, I'd have to worry about a bunch of service providers and hope none of them are evil.  Likewise, if they're able to store the updates on their server, I'm no longer in control of my data.  My provider might have a reason to put me in control (keep me as a user), but I'm likely to be unaware of what other providers are doing and have little recourse (other than de-friending everyone using their service).<p>I think it's possible to compete with Facebook. It does have a huge barrier to entry, but big companies have been toppled before.  No one thought AOL would be relegated to what it is today either.  No one thought an upstart like Google could topple the old guard.  Frankly, Facebook came in and toppled MySpace.  It happens.  But I don't think Diaspora has even addressed two of the the fundamental issues they claim to be solving.  That's what will stop Diaspora from toppling Facebook - they have yet to really talk about how to solve the two major problems they face.<p>*Also, if someome has an idea of how to address those two things, I'd love to hear it!",1283181581

The want of more toys, even if recycled, is still a message of consumerism. Having one last play with the toys as they're passed on doesn't fix it. That the film isn't ""consumerism at its worst"" doesn't mean it's not fundamentally consumerist. The message isn't ""Maybe I didn't need so many toys as a kid because I'll grow out of them,"" the message (as it relates to consumerism) is far more, ""As long as I pass things along, I can buy as much as I want.""<p>Whether or not a movie should talk about consumerism responsibly is certainly an open question. But ""guessing"" what White thinks when he gives you data, or saying that because TS3 isn't the WORST consumerism it's not consumerism, is disingenuous to the argument he makes. And Armond White's criticisms are useful as a reminder that films, even Dreamworks ones, can aspire to something higher. Does he sometimes go overboard? Probably sometimes. But the above is certainly not 'picking apart his argument'.<p>Ebert most often asks, ""Will this film entertain?"" White seems to ask, ""Is this film good?"" He concludes his TS3 review, ""When a movie is this formulaic, it’s no longer a toy because it does all the work for you."" I have to say I liked TS3 because it did all the work for me, and did so with excellence. But its excellence at delivering on fundamental plot arcs does not mean we shouldn't sometimes ask for more from what we watch. And White reminds us to keep asking.<p>(To see White displaying his talent more cleanly, check out his review of Eat, Pray, Love: <a href=""http://www.nypress.com/article-21533-pretty-woman-with-an-appetite.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nypress.com/article-21533-pretty-woman-with-an-ap...</a>)",1283181561

That said, my chair is pretty comfortable and I reason a lot from it.<p>Using patented technology without a license from the patent holder is illegal. On the other hand, you can't be sued unless people know you're doing something wrong. In-house technology that runs afoul of patents is therefore pretty safe, provided all the employees can be trusted... The moment you start exporting your technology, though, you're in trouble.<p>Making software open source does unfortunately not ""avoid the hassle of patents"". Whether your software is proprietary or open source, it can't use patents without permission. Conversely, you can hold patents on software distributed as open source -- although there would be precious little point to that, but maybe someone with an original licensing idea can correct me on that. In any case, a lot of licenses (most prominently the GPL) simply forbid this construction: if you release the software as ""open"", you implicitly grant everyone a license to use whatever patented technology you've included. Obviously, this can only apply to your own patents or patents you're allowed to re-license.<p>So: if you don't intend to publicize and you're worried about patents -- don't publicize. Conversely, if you do intend to go public, invest in good legal help first that specializes in IP. Checking your product for patents is hard, as is drawing up strategies for dealing with claimants. Nothing would be more disheartening than pouring a lot of effort in a product you will not be able to ship because a third party asks an exorbitant price for their patent use or refuses to license outright. They might buy your product from you, but that doesn't give you a startup.<p>This is not a question of ""manning up"", really (it's not like you can study real hard and then you've worked it out), it's one of economics.

What should I do?",,"About six months ago I was contacted by a HN member who had a decent startup idea, good design skills, but no programming skills. We decided to work together to create a dating website that focused around the concept of posting a date idea, then seeing who might want to join you for that date. In this way the site matches people based on what they want to do, not who they are.<p>To make a long story shorter, the idea grew and morphed, as we went through design revisions and code refactoring. The original idea of the dating site was broadened into a more general event broadcasting site, like Twitter but specifically for parties, concerts, and other events. I also came up with a few other ideas (they key ones that make the web app stand out) that I won't give away.<p>But now my cofounder appears to have disappeared. We communicated by email and chat, and all I know of his physical location was that he lived in the Middle East. I haven't heard from him in long enough that it seems likely that he had an accident or some other unfortunate circumstance.<p>So I'm left wondering what I should do. Should I try to replace him? Might there be legal issues if I do so? We never wrote up a serious contract, just an informal email in which we decided in favor of a 49%/51% division, with me holding 51%.<p>In the absence of my cofounder I have completely changed the design, and have reworked the site's entire focus. At this point there is literally no relation to the original idea of the dating site.<p>Without giving away all the details that make my startup idea special, the web app is now focused on bands and their fans, allowing bands to broadcast news and gig schedules, and allowing fans to follow bands and broadcast which gigs/concerts they will attend.<p>There is really nothing left of the disappearing cofounder's original idea, and all that is left of his original design is the logo.<p>So to summarize the situation I am in: I have a great startup idea (All ingredients of which are mine, but could possibly be considered derivative of the idea of a disappeared cofounder).<p>What I need is a cofounder who can help with some design issues, put together a new logo, and who also has good marketing skills. Programming skills would be an added bonus. Primarily what I need is a designer and marketer.<p>This is an ask HN post so here are my questions:<p>Is there anything I should do about the original disappearing cofounder?\nCould there be legal issues with replacing the cofounder even though I have changed the startup's basic principles completely and never had a serious contract with the cofounder?\nIf you have applicable skills, would you like to be my new cofounder, or do you know someone who might?",1283180819

Outside the british isles, there are few Guiness-like beers outside of Guiness itself (or more precisely the others are pretty much unknown to the vast majority of the populations).",1283180563

Yeah, AOL is still around, but it is no longer seen as a controlling force in the ISP industry. The goal of Diaspora has never been to wipe Facebook off the face (no pun intended) of the Earth - but to stop it from being such a controlling factor in social media. If Diaspora causes Facebook to become as popular as AIM is now (which, for the record - I don't think will happen, at least not just because of Diaspora), then it will have caused far more damage than anyone anticipated.",1283180551

I really wish someone would print a more fact-driven, less-sensationalized article on the AppStore. I know I'm expecting WAYYY to much our of popular media, but I can still hope can't I? :)<p>I get the impression most companies trying to make a business around app's are actually in a ""purgatory"", experiencing enough success to keep them interested but not enough to write a letter home from a resort in Tahiti. I suspect 80% of the companies in this position will die off or become very small 'part time' gigs in the next 6-12 months, the existing 20% will benefit from a maturing product (a barrier to new competitors)... hopefully they'll see fiscal rewards for their time, energy, and risk as Apple fixes the AppStore economy. Lots of developer churn nonetheless...<p>I look at the Top 100 sales charts for iTunes religiously, it's saddening to see a lot of the crap that overshadows the premium apps. The 24hour volume-driven charts discourages  educated and affluent shoppers who would pay $4.99-9.99 for a quality app, while attracting gum-stand development and crap novelty. And search sucks.<p>This has been stated time and time again yet Apple seems to not care — not because they aren't doing, but because they aren't responding to dev concerns. I imagine this type of application-churn is fiscally rewarding and so Apple currently lacks any real incentive to do otherwise.",1235335708

490824,comment,490173,490285,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Personally, as a heavy IDE user, I practically never use any code generation (unless you count token completion, but \ntext editors do that too). Additionally, I don't really code much Java (haven't in years). Most of the time I use Visual Studio and Resharper for C# 3.0. C# 3.0 has a lot of advanced functional features and the code that you write really doesn't have all that much boilerplate compared to Java. However, in the real world, people don't always get to pick their programming language. But let's say you do: Do you consider Ruby to be an unreasonable programming language?<p>For me, the three biggest IDE feature areas I love are navigation, refactoring, and code analysis.<p>Navigation: Jump to type or method (super and subclasses or by name), find usages (filtering by callers or assignments), and especially ""go to definition"". All things that help me spend more time reading code and less time reading code to find the code I want to read.<p>Refactoring: the power to rename an identifier across my entire project in half of a second is sorely missed when I work on Python stuff. Never underestimate the productivity gains of one keystroke method extraction or safely safely rearranging parameters. Make those changes you are afraid to make with confidence and without manually fixing in a long list of text search results.<p>Code analysis: finds compile and runtime errors before ever even compiling. Little colored squiggles under my code have saved me so much time, it is not even funny. You'd be surprised at the level of support these things can offer. Resharper, for example, lets me know when I use method overloads that don't pass an optional culture parameter. My code never has a localization bug with list separators such as commas and periods because Resharper warns me when I am not specific about what the correct behavior is.",1235334967

Asking your kid to stop playing a game when it does something it has no control over (or awareness of) like ""violating the Geneva Conventions"" seems like its breeding a bit of ignorance into the whole thing. It's like yelling at someone in a war film for shooting at a child... it won't change the outcome.<p>If someone actually used the power of interactivity and systemic NPC AI present in modern gaming to make a game which was aware of the Geneva Conventions and was able to reward players for adhering to them either through their own actions or how they directed their units, and presented notable moral choices surrounding that stuff, that would be I think a pretty interesting achievement.<p>Other than raising awareness of the presence of the Geneva Conventions in his son's mind (which is worthwhile in and of itself), I don't know what this lesson will teach other than incorrect side-effects like potentially misrepresenting how soldiers behave and think in real life (eg: in real life they have human brains, and are doing things other than creating a cinematic experience for the player, which is all they're there for in most war video games), and misrepresenting how interactive systems work and the potential they hold. It's very noble, and has definite merit and is also a clever idea, but it does also seem like another case of parents not understanding what games are, and trying to assign their own values to them which end up missing at least part of the point.",1235334509

It bugs me, though, when people make statements like the OP, because Apple and Ubuntu aren't doing the same thing whatsoever. Ubuntu has its goals, which include netbooks. Apple has said again and again: they understand it's an open market, but they don't want to release a product until they're certain they can make something of their accepted quality level. Meanwhile, they've made the iPhone into a miniature netbook with the App Store, and a lot of people are using it as such.<p>In the end, it's all very silly. The people who think that Ubuntu is cutting edge conflict with the Apple users who think the same, because we two camps use different definitions of ""cutting edge"".

490802,comment,490628,490715,0,0,startingup,,,"To be fair, some of us saw this coming. Did you ever read blogs like Mish, Daily Reckoning, Prudent Bear etc. I have read them for years (at least 7 years in some cases), and they have been saying these things, based on very rational considerations such as historical comparisons to debt levels and so on. Bill Bonner of Daily Reckoning, in particular, unveiled his ""trade of the decade"" around 2000: sell the Dow, buy Gold based on VERY FUNDAMENTAL grounds. At that time Dow was ~12,000, gold was around $250/ounce. Today, Dow is ~7300 and gold is at $1000/ounce. Not bad for a long term prediction.<p>Following a lot of their advice, at a personal level, for example, I sold my home a few years ago (for a tidy profit), have zero debt, I am in mostly cash + CDs, have some gold etc. I haven't made much money on my investments (except in gold, and except the tidy profit on my home) but I haven't lost anything at all over the past 10+ years, simply because I didn't ""play"" the markets. I have a lot of gun powder dry ... I hope to pick up some great companies at 10+% dividend yield at some point, for example.<p>Many people did see it coming. Most of them were the Austrian-school libertarian types - in politics, check out Ron Paul's speeches going back several years, as an example.<p>The unfunny part is that the exact types of mainstream Keynesians who <i>didn't</i> see it coming are claiming they have the fix for all this mess. That is what should make you really afraid. Most of us who saw all this coming think these morons will screw it up even more than it is already screwed up. How is that possible? Think World War III, just as one scenario or Zimbabwe/Weimar Republic for another scenario (and a nightmare that combines World War III + Zimbabwe, if you are really into horror stories!) ...<p>Is it all psychology?

In reality, it isn't that simple. A 10x programmer won't write simple code (Hello World) 10x faster. On the other side, a mediocre programmer may be unable to do some of the things that a better programmer can do, no matter how much time you give them. So it's silly to compare productivity along a linear scale like this.<p>Pairing is similar. It's meaningless to say that a pair 2x as productive as 2 developers, or 3x, or 1.5x, because it depends on the task. They might work far faster at a complex problem, but no faster one programmer at an easy one.<p>That's why my preference is to pair on anything that is moderately challenging (or harder), and to work separately on the easy stuff.",1235333683

In engineering physics textbooks, most treatments of AC circuits are very confusing for the student.  At that stage of their careers, we use sin and cos as opposed to a more complex-exponential treatment.<p>Now, the textbooks all tend to make the same basic treatment.  When I was a prof, since I am a ""challenged"" reader, rather than try to wade through the mess in the book I set apart my own derivation.  When I was finished, I naturally had to tie it back into what the textbook was saying so that the students had something to hang onto.

There's a problem that occurs once you built a manufacturing plant, research lab, and stock exchange (or whatever the terminal improvements are) in every city: there's nothing left to build!

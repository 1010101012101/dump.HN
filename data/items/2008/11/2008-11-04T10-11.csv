353278,comment,352987,353241,0,0,bengtan,,,"> broadcast the fact that it is based on drupal.<p>I'm trying to keep a middle path with regards to this. For some people, it's advantageous to know it's based on Drupal. For other people (which I hope will be majority of the target market), they'll just go ""Huh? What's that and why do I care?"", so I'm trying not to scare the former away with too much jargon.<p>For the latter, they'll find out the fact soon enough. It is clearly stated elsewhere on the site and in ProsePoint itself.<p>> The idea of editions seems like a quaint throwback to the world of
> print media. Does it make sense for online?<p>If you're doing blogs, then editions are unnecessary. However, I believe there are potential users out there who think they want editions-type functionality, whether because they migrated from print media, or they're publishing a monthly magazine, or for whatever reason (maybe the pointy haired boss said so :). If you look at some existing newspaper websites, their story listings are more than just a chronological ordering.<p>So, this is just a case of doing what (I perceive that) the users want.<p>Editions also provides two features over blogs: Convenient ahead-of-time scheduling of stories, and complex layouts. I can't quite imagine being able to do easily with a blog without some sort of customised functionality.<p>Furthermore, with ProsePoint, you can use both editions scheduling and blogs (but for different channels), so I leave it up to the user to choose.",1225796153

353274,comment,353072,353072,0,0,subbu,,,"When 2-3 bright engineers are working on something they very precisely (usually) know what they are doing. If one of them says ""It's going to take six to eight weeks"" then all the planning would've already happened in the programmer's brain. Even if it takes twice as much (10-12 weeks or about 3 months) it's not much because the baseline itself is pretty small. With this mental planning, spending time on bug tracking and filling a spreadsheet is a waste of his productive time. They will find tools like Twitter far more useful than FogBugz. In this case Twitter acts as more of communication tool than a project management tool.<p>In such small teams 'What are you working on' is more important than filling fields like 'bug type' and 'browser' or 'steps to reproduce'.<p>As we discover new ways to communicate traditional tools like bug tracking may become obsolete.",1225795858

If the cost is higher to vote (walking through the rain etc.), maybe the perceived chance is greater that your vote has a greater weight, because fewer people will show up to vote. If you make it through a tornado, you might even wind up being the only person at the voting booth.<p>Perhaps with the cheap mail-in ballots people feel too assured that everybody else will vote, anyway, so their own vote is less important.",1225794879

I have actually devised a time table to organise all of my activities and reading takes most of the time (although not easy to stick to it).<p>I was wondering though if you read and by read I mean books. If so what are you currently reading and why? What is your most favourite book and why? How many books would you estimate you read a month and finally do you think all this reading is worth it, would it not be better if you spent your time doing something else and why?<p>Now I know that's a lot of question, I am not doing a study or anything, I am just curious to know what you guys (I assume slightly more intellectually curious that most) think about engaging in reading.",1225794709

353261,comment,353222,353222,0,0,Russelldb,,,"Hi Joel, Don't want to sound like a stalker or sound too fulsome so don't get the wrong idea but I follow you in twitter and read your posts on the erlang list and find you inspirational.<p>My opinion on this is:-<p>1.  Forget the subs. Let people play for fun for free and if they want to bet take a cut of the ante or pot or something (IE you only make money when people spend money and even then only make a little). Make it very, very easy to bet (Paypal, google checkout easy). But let people play for Kudos too.<p>2. Also let people play on Facebook. Do Facebook Connect (or other social networks) so peeps joining your site can bring all their friends (their whole social graph). Make it so people can play away from your site basically (iPhone etc)<p>3. Bring in non-players IE have tutorials, novice tables, private game rooms stuff like that. There is a huge untapped market of women who love to gamble (witness the power of Bingo in the UK) if it is fun and social.<p>Personally I'd back you whatever as your drive and commitment are evident. Whether you follow my advice or not I expect you to succeed with this or another idea and if I had a few 10s of thousands of pounds I'd be in like Flynn. Sorry if that embarrasses you.",1225794355

353259,comment,353209,353251,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It's even worse than that.<p>Most polls ""weigh"" the respondents based on, well, judgment. So a poll might be weighed 60-40 dems to pubs. Or 65-35. It varies.<p>And then the polls each have their ""likely voter model"", which means all the questions they ask to figure out if you're going to vote or not. Many of these are untested.<p>I <i>think</i> Obama's going to win by 3-4 percent nationwide, but quite frankly the polls could be way out of whack in a lot of spots. He could pull out a ten-point lead, or it could get really close in spots.<p>Polling for future behavior is a very inexact science. Heck -- even exit polling isn't that great.",1225793950

The purpose of government is to have a stable group of muggers who behave themselves, not to make you guilt-free.<p>/You/ can never legitimize or de-legitimize the state, only its citizens in aggregate can.

Someone will always figure out that they can be top dog by being 10% more asshole than everyone else, and then you're back to the start- building a society around coercion and limiting assholes and useful shortcuts to revolution.<p>Public schools may not be the best, but you may have missed some important life lessons by skipping out.",1225793216

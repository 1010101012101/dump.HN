My issue, however, is that I can't find a single kid in the area who knows squat about rails or php.<p>I don't know very much about either language enough to make a real workable product, and since I am in school, I don't have the money to hire a free lancer, so I'm not really sure what to do. Aside from learning how to program, which I have been doing in every free second I have, and emailing every professor in the CompSci department, which turned up no leads, what options am I left with?",1206075575

142199,comment,142085,142085,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This guy helps illustrate my theory of why hackers and mathematicians have a reputation for being young.<p>First: Because both math and software don't require expensive equipment, credentials, or direct access to one's mentors (like Ramanujan, you can learn from books!) you can start your training as a mathematician at a very early age and be doing professional-grade work before you graduate high school. As I said the last time this came up, ""software is one of the few fields where a seventeen-year-old can have ten years of pro-level experience"".<p>Second: Mathematicians who want to get jobs in academia have large incentives to do good work when they're young: Until they make a splash, they're poorly paid grad students and postdocs. This is also true for other scientists, but in physics or biology you have to be in grad school before you can even get a long-term <i>job</i> in the lab where you can <i>start</i> learning to do great experimental work -- and then you still have to take reams of data, do multiple postdocs, etc.<p>By the time they hit age fifty, most talented mathematicians have already accomplished some math. They have jobs, and possibly tenure. They have children, they have committee meetings, they have books to write. They have already proven themselves. Even if they do accomplish some great math papers, you won't see headlines about ""astoundingly old mathematicians"". They'll be billed as ""veteran math professors"", whom everyone <i>expects</i> to do great work, since they've been doing great work ever since they were twenty!<p>But then there's this poor guy, who somehow arrived in his forties and fifties without tenure or even a job. That was unpleasant for him, of course, but it gave him a lot of incentive to do some great mathematics in order to get and keep a new academic job. And, what do you know, he rose to the occasion. Perhaps if more sixty-year-olds had good reason to do great math, we would see more of them doing so.",1206074340

Another technology that is eternally just 20 years away.<p>My main points of contention with Kurzweil are in his summary dismissal of fundamental problems in science, acting as if because Moore's law exists, nanobots running in our bloodstream are just a process node or two away.<p>He is also dismisses biological complexity as not being that inscrutable because our genome is only as long as microsoft word in bit length.  This is just silly; the power in the code is it's expressiveness that explodes combinatorially in a given environment.  You know probably far better than I do

Tablets are better for watching TV but they don&#x27;t fit in my pocket and taking a backpack with me isn&#x27;t very optimal.<p>In fact I&#x27;d like companies to make even smaller smart phones than they already do. I fantasize of iPhone Nano (iPhone the size of iPod Nano) or Pebble Call (Pebble Time with phone functionality).

10007454,comment,10006542,10007351,0,0,shostack,,,"Because in a down economy where jobs are hard to come by and corporations take advantage of employees any which way they can, this results in people being forced to choose between having a kid or keeping their job.<p>Some see that as a form of slavery or extreme control, and they want the government to step in to prevent that.<p>Further, if companies didn&#x27;t have to pay for that, that disproportionately means that lower-income workers may not be able to have kids while higher earners can because they can afford day care, only having one working parent, etc.  That goes down a whole discrimination rabbit hole.<p>That said, while I am on the side of enforced maternity/paternity minimums, I respect that it is a complicated issue.  For example, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this impacts the hiring of young women by startups.  It wouldn&#x27;t be entirely illogical to assume that a young woman has a higher likelihood of taking extended time off due to maternity leave.  For an early-stage startup, that can be their death if a key employee leaves for several months.",1438736366

The first few years of tablets sales were by people buying their first tablets because it was the hot new technology. Now that we all have one, there&#x27;s no need to buy a new one every year or every two years (in the case of cell-phones, which are mostly fueled by carrier subsidies). My HP Touchpad from 2011 still works fine--particularly since I made it an Android tablet by installing Cyanogenmod on it, thus keeping it on a far more recent Android version than any other tablet from this era would carry on their OEM firmware. It&#x27;s not terribly speedy, but I can still run stuff on it, so for a bedside comic book reader and Netflix machine, it works just fine.* I have no real reason to upgrade anytime soon, particularly since I&#x27;ve got a 2013 Nexus 7 that still runs great.<p>The industry needs to stop thinking of tablet sales like cellphones and start thinking of tablets like laptops and computers. We&#x27;re not going to buy new ones every two years because we spent anywhere from $300-$500 on the damn things:  we expect them to work for awhile. The same reason that when the computer I spent over a grand building ten years ago stops being able to run modern games on even the lowest settings, I&#x27;m going to load CentOS on it and turn it into a media server:  because I want to get my money&#x27;s worth.<p>* It also fits very well into an iCade cabinet.

You&#x27;re just tricking the service provider into potentially mis-identifying them as a different user, depending on how their SSH is configured, and it&#x27;s easily solved by a small SSH config change on their end. And it only works against someone who has multiple keys anyway.<p>> <i>A simple solution would be to avoid the single user login git@service.com, and use that as identification, for example gmalette@service.com.</i><p>Except this completely ignores the reason why services use git@service.com. It&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re lazy. It&#x27;s because the URL is supposed to identify the project, not the user. If the URL included the user&#x27;s own username, that URL wouldn&#x27;t work for anyone else, which breaks git-submodules, breaks any kind of config file that specifies repositories (e.g. for use by a CI server), and removes the ability for people to copy&paste a `git clone` command from a README (or blog post or wherever else).<p>So yes, there is a theoretical annoyance attack here, but nobody really cares because it&#x27;s never going to happen accidentally, it can&#x27;t be used against most people, and it&#x27;s so trivially bypassed nobody&#x27;s going to bother doing it except as a PoC.

In my case, the company treats employees like responsible adults and pays them to get a job done, not fill a seat.  It is an incredibly family-friendly company overall, and they really get the notion that &quot;life happens&quot; and that &quot;family comes first.&quot;<p>As a result, I take time off when I need it, or work from home, or take a half day, or whatever.  As such, I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m overall more productive, and when I&#x27;m just not feeling productive, I don&#x27;t try to force myself to do work. I haven&#x27;t had pressure, but that&#x27;s also because I&#x27;m responsible with coverage, and effective in the outcomes of what I do.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it came up as a discussion point if I was letting things fall through the cracks left and right. And that is the trade-off to this kind of policy.  Basically, when there is a minimum, people take the days (especially if they don&#x27;t roll-over).  That is a healthy forcing mechanism.  If things aren&#x27;t going well, and you don&#x27;t take the days, or are a workaholic (guilty), you might end up taking net fewer days.<p>By contrast, the relative I referenced has a manager that holds a double standard.  It is fine if the manager takes whatever time they want, but if my relative wants to take time off, they get push back, despite being exceptionally good at their job and getting shit done.<p>That&#x27;s broken IMHO, and speaks to larger cultural issues I&#x27;ve heard about that company.<p>Bottom line, I think these policies can work, but they are intrinsically tied to how a company treats their employees in general, and it can also be specific down to individual team culture.<p>I know a case of a manager who came into a situation like this from a much more &quot;traditional&quot; big company, and had trouble adjusting to their team working from home or taking frequent days off on short notice.  It was alien to them.  For the most part they let it slide, but they definitely pushed back some times which didn&#x27;t go over well with the employees who expected the culture to be upheld.",1438735957

I didn&#x27;t find any IAM rules etc to enable lambda functions to access my SQL database resources. I&#x27;d be curious to see how this is handled by this JAWS work flow.",1438735478

A big part of my strategy was to build up <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/ottoplay"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/ottoplay</a>, which is up to 130 subscribers – I&#x27;ve been pushing it in all my posts so far. (At first it was just me talking to myself so there&#x27;d be something interesting for the first viewers to read.) I&#x27;d like to make that more of a self-sustaining community, to encourage people to stay involved and share it with their friends. Right now I&#x27;m working on a much-requested feature (customizing channels) – my plan is to roll that out with private beta invites to help keep people engaged.<p>Once that&#x27;s rolling I&#x27;ll try for another, bigger round of press coverage. Up until now things have largely not been in my control – the first two articles&#x27; authors approached me after my reddit posts, the later ones never bothered interviewing me, and it got Product Hunted by a power user who noticed my failed Show HN. (I actually didn&#x27;t even realize it hit PH until the next day, took even longer to get commenting access.) But that&#x27;s probably not going to last – I expect I&#x27;ll have to do much more actively reaching out to journalists.<p>I&#x27;m starting to run out of new reddit communities to reach, but there&#x27;s some smallish ones I still haven&#x27;t hit. Maybe I&#x27;ll try another Show HN.

That&#x27;s a very small margin, especially considering both the underrepresentation in the House and the tiny overall representation.  Just how disproportionate is this?  Well, if you took away just one representative, the state would be <i>underrepresented</i> overall, as well as being grossly underrepresented in the House.

That is part of the current game.  But I would argue that selective breeding has been done for centuries, we&#x27;ve just gotten better at it.  Capitalism has basically forced dairymen to become more efficient -- which is good and bad.  My grandfather&#x27;s cows gave 40-50 lbs of milk per day, my father&#x27;s cows give 80 (some up to 120).  There are consequences when that happens.  How you get there is better breeding and better feed (feed has a lot to do with it).<p>On cow longevity, the lifespan of a dairy cow is actually a little longer than that, but the actual longevity it depends on the breed.  Holsteins go for about 6 years (lets not kids ourselves, that is not a huge jump in longevity compared to your stated 4).  As a comparison, the typical beef cow lives about 2 years.  I would talk about veal....but even I don&#x27;t eat veal.  After 6 years the animal is &quot;beefed&quot;, as kids we would called it &quot;sold to McDonald&#x27;s&quot;.  My next door neighbor was a butcher, basically the only parts unused in a cow are the tail and the moo.  Almost nothing goes to waist.<p>Never heard of a &quot;rape rack&quot;, I had to look it up.  I know a lot of AI breeders as well, that isn&#x27;t how it is done on the dairies I&#x27;ve seen.  From what I&#x27;ve seen it is not necessary, it is pretty easy to get the job done.  But, lets talk female cows...ok, lets bring in biology here, female herbivores of almost any herd species (cows, buffalo, goats, sheep, etc) don&#x27;t have many periods if there are functioning males around.

10007246,comment,10003879,10006680,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I taught English for 5 years in Japan (even though completely unqualified... cough... cough...).  In my last year I did something very similar.  The thing that got me to change was that I started tracking how much time I spent 1-1 with each of my students.  If you are lecture focussed, you end up spending mere minutes a <i>year</i> actually interacting with an individual student. I remember setting myself a goal of spending 10 minutes with each student every term (still woefully insufficient!!!) and realizing that it was impossible unless I radically changed the class structure.<p>I actually moved the assessment/quiz to the beginning of the class as a &quot;review&quot;, followed by 5 minutes of questions.  This allowed students to gauge how they were doing cold &quot;out of the gate&quot;.  Often the students would realize that they were having a problem and we would expand this section before we moved on.  In a survey that I made of the students, this was actually the most popular part of the class (which surprised me initially).<p>Next, I did 5 minutes of &quot;lecture&quot;.  Keeping it to 5 minutes was almost impossible, but I got better over time.  Then I did &quot;circling&quot;.  This is a technique where you make grammar constructions more visible through questioning.  For example, &quot;John is a brown dog&quot;, &quot;Who is a brown dog?&quot;, &quot;What is John?&quot;, &quot;What colour is John?&quot;, &quot;What kind of animal is John?&quot;, &quot;Is John a goldfish?&quot;.  I do a random walk through the students and make sure that everyone understands the day&#x27;s concept. (For some reason I can&#x27;t find a good link with a description of circling.  It is originally a technique from TPRS if anyone is interested to search for themselves).<p>Finally, there is group practice.  Essentially I made the students solve logic puzzles in English (I disguised them as &quot;games&quot;, but it boils down to this).  They were allowed to use any resource they wanted to in order to answer the questions (including asking me, asking their friends, looking up things in dictionaries, etc).  I did not enforce an &quot;English only&quot; policy because these were very low level students who had self esteem issues, but I had a sheet with everybody&#x27;s name on it and every time I heard someone use English to ask/answer a question I would give them bonus marks.  This was essentially their &quot;classroom participation&quot; mark.<p>Another successful idea for the group work at the beginning of the year was to have a series of difficult questions.  The students then had to write down the name of somebody in the class who knew the answer to the question (The game was called &quot;find someone who knows&quot;).  The idea was to integrate the higher level students and make them a valuable resource for the lower level students.  Generally speaking, the high level students usually want to impress, so they do things like answer all the questions put to them in English.  This worked surprisingly well (though probably partly due to peculiarities with Japanese social systems).<p>I only got to touch the surface of this before my contract ran out.  I decided to go back to being a programmer rather than pursue a career of teaching, but it was an eye opening experience.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made to stop concentrating on presenting material and start concentrating on my students.  So instead of explaining things, I simply watched them try to figure it out for themselves, giving them advice from time to time.",1438733364

If they choose an &quot;activist&quot; political position instead of choosing to serve people ( example, Google in China, Facebook in China ), then they&#x27;re choosing activism over engagement, and it doesn&#x27;t work for their expansion or the people.<p>The argument against a company respecting the censorship of other places is incorrectly expecting these other places to adopt the same view of censorship as that company, or, perhaps most usually, the nation state that company has most aligned itself with. Every place is different, and has different history, and the people have different things they are dealing with, and they feel their own unique way about things. These differences contribute to it being incorrect to expect that the moral views of different groups are going to be identical. And if you want to be a global company, it works to get that, and work with everybody.<p>Internationalization isn&#x27;t just about text flow direction, or message translation. It&#x27;s about adjusting your perspective on what matters, and what&#x27;s okay, for the different places you do business.<p>It&#x27;s a contradiction for people to support an online forum&#x27;s particular opinionated moderation ( censorship ) policy, distinct from other online forums, and then to not support countries doing the same thing.<p>It&#x27;s a compelling narrative to pretend that &quot;others&quot; are &quot;wrong&quot;. It&#x27;s called &quot;making them wrong&quot;, and it provides the fake pay off of pretending you&#x27;re &quot;right.&quot; And there&#x27;s a choice between making others wrong, and actually getting results, like growth in a particular market.<p>Perhaps online forums needn&#x27;t trouble themselves with these issues because their scope is limited to their own domain, and they needn&#x27;t work with other online forums. Their opinionated differences do not harm their purpose.<p>Companies aspiring to be truly global, such as to &quot;connect everyone&quot;, or to distribute &quot;all the world&#x27;s information&quot; work to consider the choice between pretending some particular country is wrong, and actually working with everybody.<p>If these companies claim to have a truly global purpose which is &quot;good&quot;, then anything that reduces the results in the direction of that purpose is amoral.

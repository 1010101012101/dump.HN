2362272,comment,2362188,2362188,0,0,Mz,,,"I got married at age 19 to a guy who only wanted to be career military.  I had lived in the same house from the age of three and couldn't go anywhere in town without running into someone I knew.  I graduated high school with folks I went to kindergarten with.  The first duty station was very, very hard for me.  We were there 18 months and I probably hated every minute of it.  The second duty station was also difficult, especially at first.  It took me some time to adapt.  Eventually, I was more hot to trot to see what our next duty station would be than he was.  But I was quite slow to adapt.<p>These days, my life is pretty portable.  I don't own much stuff, my adult sons still live with me and none of us have plans to part ways any time soon, and a lot of my social activity and hobbies and such are online/on a computer.  When I go someplace new, one of my biggest concerns is what is the food like and where can I get what I need in that regard?  Some special items I order online.  My ex husband was a gamer and when we first hit a new town one of the first things he did was try to find a gaming group in order to have a social outlet.<p>While I was still a military wife, when we moved, we would start making our ""to see and do"" list before we got to the new duty station and every long weekend was spent seeing local tourist stuff.  I've read (and noticed) that a lot of folks don't go see local museums and the like but will travel elsewhere to go see stuff like that.  I don't get that mentality.<p>You might try to figure out what you are ""homesick"" for.  You might make a list of personal needs and what is being met and what isn't.  You might try writing down what you expected of Cali and why you feel it isn't living up to those expectations.  You might try setting a target date and decide that you will make a decision at that time and will just stay put until then and not decide before then (this last one is an approach that has stood me in good stead on many occasions).<p>I liked Cali when I was out there.  But I had already made a few moves by then.  We were in Cali the last two duty stations of our marriage and divorced out there.  I was there about 7 years, part of it in Southern Cali and part in The Bay Area.  But, again, our first duty station bombed with me and it took me several years to realize it wasn't Texas' fault that I was so miserable there and to finally ""forgive"" the state of Texas.<p>Good luck with this.",1300927863

They seem to be building a social graph automatically weighted on physical proximity+frequency, using smartphone sensors (the most important one of which happens to be a camera). That's cool, and potentially game-changing.<p>""All of your contacts are presented in a list of thumbnails ordered by how strong your connection is to that user. Whenever Color detects that you’re physically near another user (in other words, that you’re hanging out), your bond on the app gets a little stronger. So when you fire up the app and jump to your list of contacts, you’ll probably see your close friends and family members listed first. But if you don’t see a friend for a long time, they’ll gradually flow down the list, and eventually their photos will fade from color to black-and-white.<p>...If you fired up Color in that restaurant example from earlier, you’d only be able to see photos that had been taken by friends and strangers within 100 feet of that restaurant. That is, unless you jump to your social connections. Tap on your best friend’s profile photo, and you’ll then be able to see all of the photos that have recently been taken within 100 feet of them. In other words, Color is trying to give you a way to see everything that’s going on around you, and everything that’s going on around the people you care about.""<p>""Color is also making use of every phone sensor it can access. The application was demoed to me in the basement of Color’s office — where there was no cell signal or GPS reception. But the app still managed to work normally, automatically placing the people who were sitting around me in the same group. It does this using a variety of tricks: it uses the camera to check for lighting conditions, and even uses the phone’s microphone to ‘listen’ to the ambient surroundings. If two phones are capturing similar audio, then they’re probably close to each other.""",1300927234

I like it when people use a more permissive license, but your code is yours to do with what you will. What bothers me is what people <i>say about</i> the GPL, because I think it's misleading.<p>There is this common idea in the free software community that it is not hostile to commercial software. That's what I don't like. If people came out and said, ""Yeah, my GPL source code has very severe restrictions that make it unsuitable for integration in commercial software,"" I would agree and wish them happy coding. But they don't say that. They use the misleading banner of ""free,"" and even try to deny that it's incompatible with commercial software.<p>Based on all the evidence I've seen, I believe commercial software pretty much has to be offered under a proprietary license in 99% of cases. The GPL says I can't do that if I use so much as one line of GPL code written by somebody else. That means that using GPL code in my software renders it unsaleable.<p>So, when you said, ""It is free to be used commercially … if you keep its derived works open source,"" I objected to that.  If you can only release your software under the GPL, you're probably not going to make a lot of money selling it — it strains the definition of ""commercial."" You can't even use the Sleepycat model, where there's a GPL version and a commercial one.<p>It's your right to put your software under that license. But I think it's important for people to understand that it completely shuts out commercial use, even if the commercial use is largely original. We shouldn't downplay that.",1300927186

already believe it.<p>3) With freedom of speech I can argue the point prior to irreversible damage.<p>Now there are some cases where freedom of speech don't apply and those are generally cases where the three points above don't apply.  For example, the classic of yelling ""Fire"" in a crowded room.  Someone else yelling, ""there is no fire"" is not likely to be heard and even if ""Fire"" is seemingly absurd, most people may not discard due to potential harm.

I don't buy the OP's argument for <i>tactically how</i> to learn one bit, but knowing concepts for everything you ""learned"" is the only way to do it. After first year, I almost never had to work hard, I could just derive anything I needed, and yeah, this included using fourier series and laplace transforms.<p>To me the key is to observe that concepts are important then observe that the easiest way to learn concepts is to learn them at the optimal time of day (ie, not 8 am during the class when you are tired, that is a waste of time), from the optimal person (ie, not your prof that just wants to get back to research), during the optimal time of the term (ie, not in the first week of class, more like the week before the midterm and the 10 days before the final). To achieve all of this just requires two skills: 1. Knowing how to learn from a text book 2. Knowing when a textbook is crap and getting a better one from internet review sites.<p>Learning from a text book is easy. Cover the page with a piece of paper and read each line. When they come up with a problem that you don't have a function for <i>derive it</i> and bam, you've invented the formula for lateral-torsional buckling of non-uniform crossectional beams you will never have trouble with the concept again. If you get stuck (stuck to the point of it hurting your ego, not ""I'm sure I would get it if I had the time"" stuck then look at the formula (not the proof if you can avoid it). Try to prove it again! If you still can't prove it, find the proof somewhere (hopefully the text, but if not email your prof or the book author for the proof). I corrected the same (otherwise super awesome) text book 3 times over the course of two years. The author loved me because out of the 5 corrections he did 1 was from himself, 1 was an email that said ""I think this is wrong"" and the other 3 were from me <i>proving</i> that he was wrong.<p>Anyways got kind of long there, but don't waste time learning from other people, just learn how to learn and damn well get the concepts otherwise what's the point?",1300926596

In your office, your employer can tape you without your knowledge while you're at your desk or at the water cooler, but they can't record you in the bathroom, where you have a reasonable expectation of privacy . You'd certainly have a somewhat subjective expectation in your home, too, even if you were using your work computer. (e.g. The courts would find it reasonable to monitor your Facebook usage on a work computer outside of work hours, but would not find it reasonable to photograph you inside your home from that same computer.)<p>Lastly, there's the human element of the courts.

I loved the OSS community <i>because</i> no one cared in the least that I was a farm girl from nowhere.  You know what?  I came in at the tail-end of a time when we had a lot more women doing open-source tech than we do now (some estimates have it around a 1:2 F:M ratio if you go back to the 70s and 80s).<p>Anybody wonder what the differences between then and now are?<p>* There were no ""girl groups"", i.e. Debian Women and the like.  Women weren't a special case in need of protection, we were as mainstream as the men.<p>* There was no pressure to be politically correct. Everyone was indoctrinated into hacker culture, we weren't supposed to treat one another like foreign specimens in need of kid gloves.<p>* The stereotype that women are more suited to design and support tasks, and men more suited to development, wasn't hanging over our heads (ironically, like the author of this article, the people pushing that stereotype are usually so-called feminists).<p>* No one cared about the demographics.  The current obsession with gender ratios in open source has been wholly counter-productive.  It's taught people they must act differently around women, that women need special help, and generally worked against the hacker ethos of ""best idea first"" (no matter from where or whom that idea comes).<p>In short, the actions of those who are obsessed with parity between the sexes are causing half the problem: increased stress between the sexes in open source communities.  The other half of the coin is what happens long before most young people come into contact with open source:<p>My 8yo son recently showed off his new netbook to some neighbors, who commented, ""It's a good thing you had a boy, Susan, what would you have done with a daughter?""<p>The boys my son knows have tech toys: netbooks, robots, Snap Circuits, and so on.  The girls don't.  Most of them never get more intimate with a piece of technology than typing and printing an essay or answering email until college, at which point it's too late.<p>Every great hacker I know was introduced to hacking in some form at a very young age.  I'm not on par with men because some patronizing feminists made me feel welcome, because the community was sensitive, or because I was gently sequestered into girl-friendly areas: it's because I wrote my first code when I was six.<p>Feminists, stop whining and let the real women do what we do, without the burden of your self-destructive attempts at shaming the men.",1300924968

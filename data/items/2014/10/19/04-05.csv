I fled the semi-socialized US system to enjoy the unfettered free market medical system provided by India at least twice, and will probably do so for future medical treatments.<p>Many medical services are repeated even if good service is provided. For example, 2 years ago I injured both my L5/S1 and L4/L5 disks. 2 years ago L5/S1 was treated, but the L4/L5 was left alone since it did not cause any problems. This year my L4/L5 started causing serious pain - the first guy did a great job so I went back. Another part of the feedback loop is reputation - if one of my friends needs similar treatment they&#x27;ll probably go to the same guy unless they are very sensitive to cost (I didn&#x27;t go for cheap).<p>I have no idea where this meme that free market health care looks like the US comes from. Maybe Canadians don&#x27;t realize there are more possibilities than simply Canadian and US health care?",1413694640

Getting it to even work is a challenge (the code is pretty terrible) and the code they force you to write is ugly, overcomplicated and unlike an idiomatic node API code.

Would this be useful? – or are most modern languages similar enough that code written in any language can be understood easily by anyone (not including pointer syntax, as not everyone completely understands that)? – or is the sum state of APIs and features so fragmented between languages and competing libraries that the technical and communal feasibility of such a project is too steep?<p>Whether there&#x27;s any merit in the idea, I&#x27;ll leave up to you.

Once you&#x27;re trained, traditional music notation is pretty optimal for reading music for performance, and you have to remember that that is the purpose of music notation. All alternative notation systems I&#x27;ve seen fail this simple test: once I&#x27;ve learned this, would I be able to play music I&#x27;ve never seen before reasonably well the first time? I&#x27;ve never seen anything that works as well as traditional music notation for that.<p>Meanwhile, music theorists are &quot;obsessed&quot; with notation only insofar as the music they study is written using that notation. You seem to have skipped my previous comments -- music theory, even at this basic level, has little to do with notation. You read it as notation obsessed only because you&#x27;re not thoroughly enough steeped in the notation. Reading and writing music notation is as natural to a musician as writing in English is to you. It would be strange and counterproductive to insist on using nontraditional notation when every musician who plays the repertoire you&#x27;re studying already reads the standard notation, and all the repertoire you&#x27;re studying is written in it.",1413692133

Dropping traffic looks different than responding with a RST, which distinguishes that port (since all the others respond with an RST).<p>But, if you instead have a default policy of &quot;drop all incoming traffic&quot;, then it doesn&#x27;t look weird that traffic to port 3306 is dropped, since traffic to all other ports is also dropped. More importantly, you also get the security benefit of using a whitelist rather than a blacklist.",1413692053

For example, it jumps into function composition before it even talks about how to use GHCi. It has a chapter called &quot;Proofs&quot;, and it seems to have a chapter focusing on using lazy evaluation to trade off time and space consumption.<p>Glancing at the text available, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make any references to other programming languages, and takes an approach of &quot;let&#x27;s build this up from the things you learned in Math class&quot;. Seems like it might be a good fit for someone with more math than programming background, or someone with enough programming experience that they want to get to the heart of what functional programming is, but a bit jaded by the usual language tutorial format.",1413691825

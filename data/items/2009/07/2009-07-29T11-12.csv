--unknown<p>""We are not so much anti-capitalist (...) We're fortunate enough to have built a very healthy business, even though we haven't attempted to. All we have done is stop short of trying to become insanely wealthy. We have met billionaires and it sounds funny but it's not necessarily a bed of roses to have that kind of money. (...) Their life becomes about figuring out how to employ all that money either by philanthropy or other means. So we don't consider it that revolutionary to have stopped short of that.""

For the registration case, just show a tick when the fields are equal. Or just wait for the round-trip, it's not that bad.<p>Frankly, the last month's talk about improving password fields is boring: it doesn't need doing. I type passwords without thinking, about twice the speed I type normally, and I don't make mistakes.<p>Something I'd like to see a password plugin/script that hashes my password with the site URL, so if they lose my password, its not my password they lose, its a site specific hash - anyone know of one?",1248867919

You know as well as every other founder out there that 95% of what you do in business or consumer facing software ain't sexy.<p>2. Some people choose to sacrifice everything. Most startups I have dealt with do this, and many dislike their decisions, but feel it's the only way forward.<p>3. That's like saying every person could beat usain bolt, they just give up too easily. Not everyone has an unlimited supply of patience or funding to try unlimited ideas, just like athlete's don't have an infinite amount of time.
If it were so easy there would be a lot more self made billionaires.<p>4. Smart people can easily get jobs doing exactly what they want.

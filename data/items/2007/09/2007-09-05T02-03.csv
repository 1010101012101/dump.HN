These abstract names (wakoopa, frengo, squidoo) aren't really built upon any particular app of substance . . . it's a kind of reverse-branding that hurts in the long-run.  Selling names works, but only a bit.  Sooner or later, you have to sell substance.  ",1188961099

Wakoopa, Frengo, Squidoo or Meebo all might be acceptable on an individual basis. But when every startup in the Valley begins opting for whimsy (and a non-stop barrage of vowels) over, well, making sense, the results can be less than desirable.",1188959803

That seems like it should be solvable, though: for example, you could present both kinds of items in the UI.",1188959731

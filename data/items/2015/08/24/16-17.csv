Her view was that it was pointless to blame anything on &quot;pilot error&quot; because if the plane let the pilot screw up it was a flaw in the design of the plane.<p>That&#x27;s a good way to view any problem having to do with people. People are the same as they&#x27;ve always been--it&#x27;s ludicrous to think that they&#x27;re intrinsically any lazier or have less self-control than people a generation or two ago. If they&#x27;re a lot fatter than prior generations, then something external must be different. You&#x27;re never going to fix people, so if you want to solve the problem you have to focus on those external things.",1440435582

I don&#x27;t think that holding stock for less than a year is generally a good idea, due partly to the tax difference but largely because I&#x27;m not trying to time the market.<p>> <i>The problem isn&#x27;t short term capital gains taxes</i><p>Short-term capital gains are a pretty big deal.  The gap between short-term and long-term capital gains taxes is up to 20%.<p>> <i>If that happens you will have both lost money on the stock, and have to pay ordinary income tax on the value of the stock before it went down.</i><p>You can deduct the capital loss, up to 3000.

That means, go with stocks for a decent segment of your investments but temper this with investments that will help preserve capital when things get rocky. Keep a ratio between the two that is age-appropriate. There is a rule of thumb floating about among advisors that your stock percentage should be 110 minus your age. This may or may not be a good ratio for you but some method that helps discipline you in these decisions will help you and this is not a bad one for many people. The other major factor is to avoid impulse buying or selling and to keep transaction costs at a very low level - and this usually means going with broad-based no-load index funds for much of the ride.<p>Doing the above will not make anyone rich.

For instance, efficient storage of vector shapes, more complex masking which allowed the use of JPG images in place of PNG&#x27;s (which resulted in a smaller file size), and a large API that reduced the need for external dependencies (and thus code size).<p>Flash also had far more advanced animation capabilities that HTML5 is still struggling to reproduce. HTML5 still lacks decent tooling for producing such animations that work in an efficient, cross browser way. Think about why GIF&#x27;s and autoplaying videos are so popular now. They provide the most reliable way to add motion and interest to a page and they those things are huge file size wise.<p>One concrete example - we&#x27;re making the move from Flash banners to HTML5 banners and finding that we&#x27;ll need a much larger file size to even approach the same level of polish that we did before. Whereas before Flash banners were typically limited to 40-50k, the IAB is going to recommend 200kb banners as the standard for desktop HTML5 banners.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying the world should stick with Flash, but instead of just ripping on Flash, I think as web developers we need to be pushing for better tools and better capabilities that will allow for more creativity and expressiveness than we are typically able to produce now. And just as a disclaimer, I&#x27;ve tried Adobe Edge, Google Designer, and coded many things by hand using Canvas, SVG, CSS3, etc.",1440434784

If you use multiple SDKs, they may fight.<p>- Lack of understanding: People too eager to use SDKs often lack the understanding of how it works.

Most believed that the plaques of cholesterol and other substances that clog the arteries to the heart would not go away. The traditional way to remove them was to wait until they became severe enough to warrant a bypass or angioplasty.<p>At the University of California in San Francisco, Dr. Ornish tested the theory that a more potent diet, along with other lifestyle changes, might actually reverse heart disease. He selected patients who had plaques that were clearly visible on angiograms and split the patients into two groups. Half were referred to a control group in which they received the standard care that doctors prescribe for heart patients. The other half began a vegetarian diet in which less than 10 percent of calories were contributed by fat. They were also asked to begin a program of modest exercise and learned to manage stress through a variety of simple techniques. Of course, smoking was not permitted.<p>Dr. Ornish’s patients started to feel better almost immediately, and continued to improve over the course of the year. They had previously been struggling with the crushing chest pain of heart disease, but “most of them became essentially pain-free,” Dr. Ornish said, “even though they were doing more activities, going back to work, and doing things that they hadn’t been able to do, in some cases, for years.”&quot;",1440434603

The picture that&#x27;s being painted is that the vast majority of us will be living lives as serfs, while a group of oligarchs (the arbitrarily mythical 1%) determine our fates while eating grapes and being fanned.

Imagine a social order - call it &quot;A&quot; - in which most people are paired off and raising a family. In that world, a large portion of the families have two incomes, which are going to pay for a single rent or mortgage bill, a single set of utility expenses, etc. Imagine another society, &quot;B&quot;, in which many of the folks corresponding to those paired adults have instead decided to go it alone, either by way of divorce, or even deciding to have a family with no mate.<p>Isn&#x27;t it obvious that in society &quot;B&quot;, the un-paired &quot;families&quot; are going to have far less aggregate income (&#x27;cause there&#x27;s not a second breadwinner earning that income), and are going to have much greater expenses at the same time (&#x27;cause there&#x27;s not a mate to share housing and utilities, and in fact other things like dining may need to be outsourced, that being the result of not having a mate to cooperate with)? And compared to those families that are following the &quot;A&quot; model, it&#x27;ll appear that the &quot;B&quot;s have a disadvantage?<p>It doesn&#x27;t apply for every case, but for most &quot;B&quot;s, a decline in purchasing power for the family is directly explainable by their own choices.

Also, spinning up and replicating the data over to another machine is click-easy and convenient.<p>As for having the entire functionality in one Python script, it was more of wanting to have à la carte functionality since I know projects like this coming in all shapes and sizes. I definitely agree that from a simplicity point of view, one Python script would be much easier. But, I wanted people to be able to just copypasta what they wanted and go from there with multiple sensors or multiple notification messages.<p>I also did not like the Node dependencies (why is installing Node on RBPi still so hard?).

Microsoft seem to have attracted some overall positive reviews at launch for Win10 in the general press and non-geek PC sites/magazines, but a lot of that positive early coverage is getting drowned out by concerns about reliability, privacy, and whether the relatively few big new features (Cortana, Edge, DirectX 12) are actually worth much anyway (with, respectively, questionable effectiveness, lack of plug-ins, and few if any games available that take advantage of it any time soon, among other challenges). &quot;It&#x27;s not as bad as Win8&quot; is not a pitch that is going to support sales for the next several years, particularly when so many of their business customers are still on 7 anyway and have nearly 5 more years before they&#x27;re going to run into end-of-support issues and be forced to act one way or another.<p>Microsoft seem to be throwing everything into cloud and services and mobile-friendly software and new devices, at the expense of solid server/desktop/laptop software that until recently has generally just worked and aside from the occasional blip stayed just working for a long time.

Randomness only occurs in the absence of suicide letters which state that the leak caused them to do it. At least two scenarios:<p>1. They leave suicide notes where they explicitly attribute it to the hack. Then, the probability that it is due to the Ashley Madison hack becomes = 1. The question then becomes, did the &#x27;outing&#x27; push them over the edge. Especially so, if they attribute taking their life to multiple reasons.<p>2. If it is not attributed to the &#x27;outing&#x27;, then one has to carefully see what the probabilities of suicide are in their particular cross-section of population and also consider other risk factors. The numbers someone else quoted here, 16/100,000 is an average. It is fallacious to assume that this number uniformly applicable to the population as a whole. You have to consider prior probabilities for each individual. These priors can possibly be computed based on the individual&#x27;s medical history, socio-economic background, geographical location, etc. with importance assigned in that order. I would imagine medical conditions would play a big role. For example, if an &#x27;outed&#x27; person with no history of depression, etc. from a hyper-religious family commits suicide, it is quite likely that it was because of the &#x27;outing&#x27; in the absence of explicit attribution in a suicide letter, etc. If a person has on his/her history previous suicide attempts, depression, etc. the marginal probability that it was solely due to the Ashley Madison outing would probably be lower.",1440433431

So there&#x27;s a contraction in big outsourced tech projects with bigger businesses that can start within weeks. If you have big things planned with these guys, close the deal right.now.<p>Then, many startups who have been too reliant on investor capital for survival get into a pickle when investors stop being as generous dishing out venture and angel rounds. Any company dependent on raising a round of financing in the next 6 months is in a tough place. If you work for any of these guys, polish your resume.<p>So you start to see layoffs at big consulting firms, then startups start to fail when funds get antsy. This puts a lot of engineering talent on the market, first at job interviews and later for freelance after they&#x27;ve been on the market for a few months. Increased supply means lower salaries and freelance rates. Last time around the big tech cos like Google and Facebook went on a feeding frenzy and drove the supply down, and the mobile thing happened. So salaries bounced back and then went bezerk<p>I have a feeling if this is another big one, this time around there will be less feeding frenzy and more pruning - the tech giants can use this as an excuse to lay off engineers hired on inflated salaries and not performing. The mobile bubble popped already, and the current bubble is in AI and big data which needs more more specialized brainpower and probably won&#x27;t pick up a lot of the supply<p>We also have tons of very junior developers swamping the market with training from coding bootcamps right now. So at the low end of the developer spectrum there&#x27;s potentially a huge surplus. If things get sour in the market this will be a very tough time for an entry level developer, a pay cut for a mid level developer, and a minor worry for a good developer.

This means when I reach my retirement age I might have to wait around 8 years for the market to rebound if I&#x27;m not lucky enough to buy my shares on the bottom of the charts, right?<p>The reason I&#x27;m asking is because I keep reading about how an index fund will eventually, given time, be worth it, even with these frequent crashes of late, but when I&#x27;m 60 it might not be possible for me to wait for a better time to cash out, in particular given my country&#x27;s (men) life expectancy of around 75. In my view, this doesn&#x27;t seem as safe as it sounds but I might be missing something.<p>Let&#x27;s pretend I have my own retirement fund as a savings acount at around 1%, a very slow but pretty much safe growth. This way I might end up having with a more stable outcome when actually retiring which I believe is what most people would be looking like. I hate reading a market crash could wipe out poor and middle class retirement funds and have a hard time understanding the point besides greed or lack of knowledge.<p>Again, I&#x27;m most probably the one with lack of knowledge on this, just sharing my doubt as a very very conservative investor, if at all.",1440432854

3120059,comment,3118125,3118125,35,0,alexlarsson,,,"Reading this thread makes me pretty sad. Usually there are people on hacker news that at least know the background, and generally there is a measure of respect that other people might actually know something about what they work on. The Gnome developers (which includes me) have more than ten years of experience working on unix and developing a desktop for it. Please don't assume we're making decisions because we're stupid, we might actually have reasons to do what we do.<p>Lemme try to explain some background on configuration storage in gnome.<p>But first, the main complaint in the article is that you can't modify the layout of the fallback mode panel in gnome 3. This is just not true, you can modify them in the UI just like before, only you have to hold down alt when you bring up the menus, etc. This was done because a lot of people accidentally changed their panel around causing problems. I'm sure this change could have been better documented and whatnot, but it <i>is</i> possible.<p>Once upon a time there was a design decision in Gnome to use so called ""instant apply"" configuration options, rather than having each config dialog button have ""apply"" buttons. You can disagree if you want, but this decision drives the design of the configuration framework. Basically, it implies having some kind of service that handles configuration changes that will tell other applications of configuration changes. Thus was born GConf.<p>The original on-disk format for GConf was an on-disk tree that mirrored the gconf key hierarchy, where each directory had a %gconf.xml file that listed the keys in that directory.<p>However, it turns out that this is a major performance problem when reading settings. Each such file you open causes two random access seeks on the hard drive. One to read the inode and one to read the data. Hard drive consecutive data read speeds are pretty high, but seeks are very slow (for physical reasons), which was significantly affecting login and app startup speed of gnome.<p>So, we merged the all the separate files into xml tree files, using one per application. This cut down on seeks a lot and improved performance. (Of course, a negative aspect of this is that the xml files are not very human readable anymore. But the vast majority of readers do not access the text files directly anyway.)<p>However, even after this gconf reads was a problem for log in performance. We do of course do local caching of gconf data in each process and we preload it in chunks, however during login the gconf daemon was acting as a serialization point for all processes that were starting up. Also, all these xml trees were pretty verbose, so parsing and loading also took some time.<p>Over the years we increased our knowledge of the problem space, and eventually we came up with a replacement for GConf. It has two parts, one is the API, which lives in glib, called GSettings. Its an abstraction for settings with change notification that has client-side schemas (as opposed to server side schemas like with GConf, another thing we learned). The implementation is pluggable, there is an ini file backend, a win32 registry, and the DConf backend, which is the default for Linux distros.<p>DConf uses a binary on-disk format that is mmapable and readable without ""parsing"". I.e. each app maps the config file readonly (sharing this memory), and lookups is done directly in the in-memory mapping without an intermediate parsed copy of the data. The data is stored in an efficient hash-table which allows very fast key lookups with few pagefaults in the file. The actual data is stored using GValue, an immutable binary datatype for recursive types that is in glib. So when a value is returned we don't even duplicate it but just return a wrapped reference to the data in the mmaped file.<p>Writes to dconf do go through a daemon which handles write serialization and change notification. Communications with the dconf daemon is through dbus, which incidentally has an on-wire binary data format that is a subset of GValue.<p>So, how does this help us? Well, for one thing we never block during login for reading configuration, as all reading is parallelized. Secondly we don't spend any time parsing files, as the config file, once mapped, is already in a compact ""parsed"" format. Thirdly, we never waste any memory storing copies of configuration data on the heap.<p>Now, there are some obvious drawbacks with binary formats. For instance, you need tools to modify them, like the dconf-editor GUI app or ""gsettings list-recursively"". Secondly, you can't use text based tools like e.g. git, emacs or diff/patch to maintain them.<p>But, you got to realize that we are not unaware of these problems. We are well aware of them, but we made the conscious decision that the real life problems with the many-text-files approach to configurations (as listed above) outweigh the advantages. Especially considering that most of our users don't need to directly modify the config files.",1318851467

I was a programmer with some interesting ideas, and my business partner and I agreed at the time that I would receive 20%, and my partner 80% (he was financing the whole thing).  We had a personal falling out in early 2005, and I left the company, always believing that my ownership was still intact.  In October 2010, the company was sold for $64 million to Equifax.  I found out about the sale after the fact; my partner had simply pretended that I never existed and had assumed my ownership.  I am listed as the inventor on the company's first patent, which is still a key part of the company's product offerings today.<p>In February 2011, I sent a cease-and-desist letter to Equifax.  They sent back a letter saying that they viewed my letter as an extortion attempt, and that if I did not immediately sign a settlement and and NDA that were included with their letter (without compensation), they would file a criminal complaint against me. After this, I showed my cease-and-desist letter to an attorney, who assured me that my letter was well within the law, but that their response was in fact extortion. There is a specific federal law that prohibits threatening to accuse someone of a crime unless they give you some form of consideration - in this case the outright dismissal of $12.8 million in claims. Their response came entirely out of left field, and I have not heard from them since the moment the attorney I showed the letter to told them that he believed their response was a violation of Federal extortion laws.  The letter was signed by my former business partner, who was at the time still the CEO of the Anakam division of Equifax, and was, oddly enough, forwarded to me from their law firm.<p>I do not have the resources to pursue this matter at this time.  I am told that I could have those involved in authoring and delivering the extortion letter prosecuted criminally (possibly including Equifax itself), but I have little interest in that right now.<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can/should do in this situation? I have come to the realization that I may never see my $12.8 million, but the extortion really added insult to injury.  Any suggestions would be helpful.<p>You can email rr@guiyui.com if you would prefer not to post in public.",1318851272

In short, if the government were to say to the common man ""We must give this rich person one trillion dollars and you and your children will pay for it"", there would be revolution.<p>But if the government says ""Look! The stock market has crashed! We must give one trillion dollars to the banks so that the financial system does not collapse, so that children and dogs do not roam the streets, oh dear God we must give one trillion dollars to the banks now!"" And nobody complains.<p>Better yet, give one trillion dollars in a highly recognizable bill, lets call it TARP. Make sure that all of <i>that</i> money is paid back. Then, when someone says ""But we gave you all that money"", the rich can claim ""TARP? No! We paid all that back! Look!"".<p>But also give several trillion more in completely one-off, non publicized, totally forgettable transactions. For example, give citibanks $25bn in TARP funds - and also give them $275 in non-TARP funds. Then have them pay the $25bn back. Amazingly, if you ask the average american about citibank, they will say ""Yes, they got $25bn! Bastards"". ""No! They gave that $25bn back! Look it up!"" ""Oh you are right!"" And that will be the end of it. Fox News will tell you almost daily, ""Look who paid back their TARP funds! TARP has made a profit!"". TARP is the hand they want you to look at, while they make your future vanish with the other.<p>You have to admit, its really impressive.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.npr.org/2011/05/02/135846486/how-some-made-millions-betting-against-the-market</code></pre>",1318851253

And people often asked why we (NBC or FOX, in my case) wouldn't accept unsolicited submissions of show ideas. The primary reason we didn't is that it was a legal minefield. If you read someone's submission, and you rejected it, and years later you developed a show with even the slightest <i>hint</i> of an element from that concept, the person who submitted it could sue you. And, even if he wouldn't prevail 9 times out of 10, he'd still eat up a lot of time and work and money in the process.<p>The problem is that there's really nothing new under the sun. Every basic plot imaginable has been conceived. Every core concept shy of the truly insane or inane has already been pitched (and even those have been pitched, trust me). The chances that your unsolicited submission will bear more than passing similarities to a concept already pitched, or already in development, are quite high.<p>Aggravating this problem is the fact that people have sued over the most facepalmingly generic bits of supposed intellectual property: character names(!), broad-stroke concepts (i.e., ""I sent NBC an idea about superheroes; NBC made a show about superheroes!!!11!1""), and so forth.<p>At the end of the day, opening an unsolicited envelope is more hassle than it's worth. I can't say if this is a motivating factor for game developers or publishers, but I imagine it would be.",1318850496

3120021,comment,3119586,3119586,3,0,josephg,,,"I've followed a very similar road.<p>For me, the thing which halted that ivory tower mindset was changing languages. I find that after spending a lot of time in a single language, I start thinking along that language's lines when I'm designing software. There are a lot of things which are a good idea in some languages and rubbish in others. Eg, enums are great in C, but useless in Javascript. Interfaces and abstract classes are silly in ruby.<p>I think there's a trap programmers fall into with this stuff, where we get used to some method / philosophy. After awhile, its easy to forget that the method comes with a price that is being paid daily. Only by periodically re-evaluating all the little decisions you make can you start to get a real sense for when those decisions are appropriate.<p>But as for the code rot problem, there are two solutions I've seen which made a difference:<p>- Test-driven development (full on, no cheating, tests before you write code. 95%+ code coverage)\n- Code reviews before every commit<p><i>But both of these methods will slow you down heaps in the short term.</i><p>I find proper TDD makes me about half as productive in the short term. In the long term, it slows down big redesign work because there's twice as much code to change. The benefit is that you can formalise all your obscure edge cases in tests. If your test coverage is good enough, you can safely refactor code without breaking anything. This removes fear from development and lets you make clear decisions about design. (Also, its amazing how many bugs you find when you start writing tests. It is humbling.)<p>I suspect that most of the benefits of code review comes from simply setting aside time to talk about code style. It consumes a lot of time. In exchange, you get higher quality code.<p>How much you care about speed and code quality really depends on what the project is. You need to try them both out some time to be able to make that decision properly.",1318850276

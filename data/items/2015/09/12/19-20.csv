Or wholly true if we put emphasis on his explicitly &quot;trying to&quot;.<p>Because his work could also communicate other things that he wasn&#x27;t trying, but are nethertheless apparent in the output.<p>Consider a racist writing his autobiography, and trying not to sound like a racist and avoids any open remark, but it still comes out in the text. In the same way, an authors beliefs and feelings on all kinds of things, even if subcoscious or hidden from himself, can also come out in the text, despite him not actually trying to communicate them.<p>If we don&#x27;t consider just what the author explicitly tried to communicate, but all that&#x27;s present in the final output, the author is not the &quot;only source&quot; anymore. We can also use other knowledge we have, of cultural norms, ideas of his era, symbolism, etc.<p>><i>Whether or not a majority of critics agree is totally irrelevant to me. If the author agrees, that is a different matter.</i><p>That&#x27;s quite an inflexible view of literature/poetry etc, which has been shown to be lacking for near a century. Heck, even authors frequently say in their interviews: &quot;I just put put these images and they are up to the reader to understand them in one way or another&quot;, or words to that effect. (Songwriters also are of this school very often: &quot;my songs have no defined meaning, are open to interpretation etc&quot;.).<p>In the example of the racist author, how about if the author doesn&#x27;t &quot;agree&quot; that his work is racist, but his working and portrayal of black characters makes evident that it is? It doesn&#x27;t even need to be because he&#x27;s lying, could just be that he considers the kind of attitude he has to blacks &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; and not racism.<p>The author is hardly the &quot;only authority&quot;. If not for anything else because people have subconscious feelings, people hide things from themselves (even when they&#x27;re not subconscious, they might downplay their importance when you talk to them, but come pouring down when they write), and of course, people lie.",1442087792

World-class companies (Airbnb, Mercedes, Nordstrom to mention a few) use Medallia to create awesome customer experiences.<p>We are a fast-growing (70% per year), Sequoia-backed company that recently became a tech unicorn; our mission is no less than to transform the way the world&#x27;s companies view and interact with their customers. We allow hundreds of thousands of employees to access, analyze and take action on large amounts of customer data in real time. We are still a small engineering team, only about 50 or so of us, thus everyone counts.<p>We are building the new platform based on the latest technologies and best practices: pure REST APIs, based on Swagger 2.0, on top of a state-of-the-art microservice architecture built by our awesome Systems Foundation team. Code is hosted on Github and we open source the components that are of general interest. We host hundreds of millions of records for our customers and run analytics in fractions of a second with no pre-computation thanks to our own in-memory analytics engine.<p>Please send me a note at kristian@medallia.com if any of the above sounds interesting to you.<p>Kristian Eide\nSoftware Architect",1442087749

We haven&#x27;t yet found a design that gives value proportionate to the complexity, although we continue to think about it.<p>If they can find a way to add it that doesn&#x27;t take away the simplicity they enjoy, all the better.<p>> As far as it being &quot;simpler&quot; that Go doesn&#x27;t have generics, I&#x27;ve never understood this conclusion.<p>That&#x27;s if you require generic objects.

We can do a complete security audit in fifteen minutes.<p>> Is having thousands or millions of users practical, or is this intended more for a limited-use in house application?<p>Envelope is a very small C binary. You&#x27;ll find it scales way better than PostgreSQL itself and as such you should be able to apply similar strategies. You&#x27;ll find your database design is way more important than the Envelope overhead. If you were going to open a site to millions of users I would consider pooling users into groups so you could pool PostgreSQL connections. Again, the bottleneck isn&#x27;t Envelope, but PostgreSQL.<p>> Is it practical to allow new users to register on the site and have a site admin manage their roles and permissions through a web interface, or do DBAs need to manage that stuff manually in psql?<p>We don&#x27;t use psql. Envelope includes Postage, a sort of web based PGAdmin. Developers can use that to administrate the database. We&#x27;ve also written a &#x27;User Admin&#x27; app for non-developers that we&#x27;ve installed into some of our client Envelope instances.

A very good hack, but he was writing plays to pay his rent, not as some otherworldly font of the muse with a mainline connection to the soul of literature.  He&#x27;s got much more in common with Stephen King or Dan Brown, as a writer of popular, mainstream entertainment, than he does with critically acclaimed, popularly ignored capital L Literature.<p>MacBeth and Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are great, timeless works, but Shakespeare turned out a lot of historical plays and comedies that are kind of meh.  Particularly the comedies are pretty formulaic, if you read two or three of them in succession, and there&#x27;s nearly as many thinly-veiled (save the archaic language) dick jokes and scatological humor as in a Judd Apatow film.  Not to mention the slapstick elements, and foolery that doesn&#x27;t necessarily show up in the printed stage directions, but undoubtedly played well to the groundlings at the Globe.<p>Reducing Shakespeare&#x27;s dramatic productions to just the dusty words on the page does a disservice to the reality.<p>It&#x27;s alternate-history fiction, but I enjoyed Harry Turtledove&#x27;s Ruled Brittania for putting a more human face on Shakespeare <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ruled-Britannia-Harry-Turtledove/dp/0451459156"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ruled-Britannia-Harry-Turtledove/dp/04...</a>",1442086342

Not how much would you force someone else to pay at gunpoint.  Not how much would you imagine being willing to pay in the moment for 5 years of ideal life.  How much, every year from birth to death, would you really be willing to pay for 5 years of probably-degraded life?  Everything you pay means giving up something else.

Drugs aren&#x27;t perfectly effective, and whatever they&#x27;re intended to treat is very likely causing symptoms that also reduce quality.  Very often that combination reduces quality to a great extreme.  And paying for drugs, whether a vast sum or a relative pittance, means not having something else, which, you guessed it, reduces quality.<p>Economics is the study of scarcity and how humans adapt themselves to it.  Both quality and quantity of life are scarce resources, and there are tradeoffs to be made with other scarce resources.

10208950,comment,10208075,10208557,0,0,Denzel,,,"I&#x27;ve never been a Go evangelist. For years, the appeal and praise lavished upon Go flummoxed me. Until I decided to use Go for my latest product. Then it made sense. For most purposes Go is &quot;good enough.&quot; And it&#x27;s good enough in enough areas for me to set Go as the standard, de facto language at my company, unless there&#x27;s a damn good reason to use another language.<p>I appreciate Go because it&#x27;s fast, small (re: syntax and standard library), garbage collected with nice primitives (pointers and slices), concurrent with high-level primitives (goroutines, channels, select), expressive enough (strings, maps, range, first-class functions, type system, etc.), first-class support for Unicode, and it has a rock-solid standard library.<p>About a month ago, I started learning Go. It&#x27;s so small. The language, the standard library, the tools. They&#x27;re all so easily digestible; it took me 4 days to work through the Go playground, read the entire Go specification, work through and learn 40% of the standard library, and start writing production-ready programs. C was the last language that enjoyed a language/standard library this small, to me.<p>The same thing can&#x27;t be said for Ruby or PHP, or any other languages I&#x27;ve worked with. In almost every project I&#x27;ve been involved with, there would be usage of some arcane corner of the language. Whether it&#x27;s determining the byte offset of a member function in C++, or the GCC extensions to structure initialization in C, or metaprogramming magic in Ruby. All these cracks and crevices are difficult to keep in your head. This isn&#x27;t so with Go. It&#x27;s easy to keep the entire language and standard library in your head; providing a certain ease and flow when building a program.<p>Ease of use applies to memory management as well. Go offers just enough control over memory to make it pleasant to implement and use real data structures. Try implementing an LRU cache in Ruby/Python that evicts based upon an object-size policy without wasting a ton of memory simply maintaining a linked list. When I built a distributed real-time, type-ahead service in Ruby I was fighting the language the whole way when it came to simple data structures, memory management, and concurrency. (It was just a prototype, I know Ruby wasn&#x27;t the right tool.) Originally, I was going to rebuild the service in C++, but that would&#x27;ve taken too much time. Instead, I opted for Go and it was much easier, and obviously much more performant. Not as performant as an equivalent C++ service, but performant enough.<p>I don&#x27;t think much needs to be said about Go&#x27;s concurrency. First-class primitives such as goroutines, channels, and selects along with solid standard library support in sync and sync/atomic, makes for a powerful combination. Go wraps these concepts in a very bland, mainstream way. Making them more accessible to more people with little time investment.<p>You&#x27;re right, Go will not win based upon the # of LOC written. However, after writing 20k+ LOC in Go over the past month, I don&#x27;t see any reason to write any of our back-end code (infrastructure, services, web servers, tcp servers, etc.) in anything other than Go. It&#x27;s good enough in enough areas to make it much faster for a team to standardize on just this one language. Not only does this reduce the time wasted due to context switching between languages in a polyglot shop, it makes it a ton easier for anyone to jump in and contribute anywhere at anytime.<p>---<p>To give my thoughts some context, here&#x27;s a subset of my professional and personal language/project history:<p>- Ruby: 100k+ LOC Rails monstrosities and smaller 20k LOC projects<p>- PHP: 200k+ LOC bare-PHP e-commerce websites and 50k LOC CodeIgniter/Laravel intranet apps<p>- Python: 10-20k LOC utility and server management scripts<p>- C++: 500k+ LOC open-source 3D game engine and multiple <10k LOC personal projects<p>- JavaScript: ~35k+ LOC for the front-end work on some websites I&#x27;ve worked on<p>- Common Lisp: read all of Practical Common Lisp and ANSI Common Lisp, and dabbled in a few small programs",1442084797

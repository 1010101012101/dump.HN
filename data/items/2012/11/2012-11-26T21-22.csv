Unfortunately, the first versions of both Java and JavaScript predated this and got strings horribly wrong, and now any conforming implementation of either is required to suck. The Right Thing would be for almost everyone to work with only combining character sequences, except for a rare few who need to know how to dissect one into its codepoints and reassemble them correctly (just as people don't normally need to extract high or low bits from an ASCII character).",1353967101

That's accurate for unit tests, but I don't think it really captures the spirit of integration or functional tests.<p>Integration tests, to me, provide value by making a space to brainstorm ""what if"" questions around corner cases of interactions between components. Testing the ""happy path"" provides confidence that all the individual assumptions aren't inconsistent as a whole.<p>Functional tests, for me, provide a way to think about ""well, this is what we built, and it's internally correct, but is it what will fit the needs of our users?"" I would also differentiate between end-to-end scenario testing, and discrete testing of a single unit of functionality. An example of the former would be the signup process, while the latter might be making changes in a preferences configuration screen.<p>I think it would be worthwhile to also discuss ""tenet"" testing, such as Performance, Accessibility, Localization/Internationalization, Failover/Rollover, Security.",1353966940

How and when, and again how, if when is later (for example in Long Mode or Protected Mode) to set up all this GDT and IDT stuff. They say you have to set it up before the kernel. Then they say you can set it up with dummy values and set it up later in kernel. Then they say, that to set it up, you have to be in Real Mode, so your kernel (which might be way over 1Mb of real mode space), needs to switch between modes. And then if your kernel is over 1Mb, you cant access memory locations after 1Mb, and so on Its confusing, but Im going to find it out and post it here later on.<p>How to handle Interrupts in C? 
Will they perform as callbacks that await some return values or do I have to use inline assembly to process them correctly;<p>Is it possible to write MBR in C? 
I do understand that you still have to set ORG to 7c00h, and use some specific assembly instructions, but if they could be wrapped in C using inline assembly and C entry point can be glued with few lines of assembly code, why not?",1353966911

> Why is this?<p>Think about it: the header potentially depends on any ""define"" value defined before the header is processed. If we'd have modules that define interfaces that don't depend on macros, we can process all the definitions that make the module only once for all the obj files that depend on it.<p>You typically don't need conditionals on if another module is used or not. You need conditionals to compile the whole application or the dynamic library some specific way, but that is also only once per the compilation of the whole application.<p>At the moment there is really code that can include more times he same header to define different types, but these are extreme use cases, however most of the libraries would gain if they would be defined as ""modules"" definitions of which can be compiled only once per application build.",1353966677

They will almost certainly be called upon to make decisions about the company, and without expertise they'll probably do a middling job of it. It seems quite sensible that, especially in your heirs are unfamiliar with the business, that the employees should have their self-interest piqued in some way when you pass it on. After all, if you devote 20% of the company to employee equity, and the company performs 30% better as a result, your heirs will be better off because of it.<p>It seems like the people who work at the company are most qualified to run it, and that giving them some incentive to run it well is in everyone's interest.

If you have the person's information and bill, you probably have enough info to get the line transferred. And sometimes, providers will accidentally/idiotically allow a number to be ported even if the information isn't correct; there's plenty of room for mistakes.<p>Another attack is to target the way they place the outbound call. Suppose they place the outbound call with provider X. An attacker might sign up and start a port via provider X. If provider X has poor code, they might activate the number internally, and route all their customers calls to your account, before they find out the port's been rejected. Or you might be able to compromise the provider another way - many providers and VoIP software systems are hilariously weak on security.<p>The first attack will work across the entire phone network; the second requires the authentication call to be made via an insecure provider.",1353965829

I can present all the options I've found \n    at our next meeting.\n</code></pre>\nNotice that I tried to avoid any deep technical details (e.g. after you email me the changes, I will add an item to the bug tracker and do feature-branching to implement the changes then deploy to the staging server).

The word ""microcontroller"", except in certain extremely specialized situations, should probably not be used with a client. I understand it's a hard pill to swallow. I mean, you're both speaking English. Why does it seem like you're not speaking the same language?<p>In a way, you're not speaking the same language. Try assuming your clients have no concept of not just programming, but any of the process of building an application or solution to a problem that uses technology. Don't discuss details. They are probably paying you so that they don't have to worry about the details.<p>By way of example: I have the reverse problem with my wife. She is a nurse. When telling me about her day, she used to fly through a great deal of technical details using an amazing number of acronyms and abbreviations that I found not just unintuitive, but completely incomprehensible. I genuinely care about how her day was, but I found myself exclaiming in exasperation, ""I have a clue what any of that means!"" She now explains only what is necessary to get the point across, and defines acronyms as she goes along, if necessary.

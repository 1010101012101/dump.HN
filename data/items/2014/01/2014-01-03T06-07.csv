I agree to an extent that the programmed logic of the game falls into the background a bit with these kind of games.  There still has to be rules - but it&#x27;s more like the rules of real-life than an actual &quot;game&quot; that is being played. In real life, nobody can really prevent you from shooting someone else - its just that most people agree that you should be put in jail (or killed) for doing something like that, and therefore there are consequences.  People find it interesting that there can be other worlds with similar dynamics (but the stakes are lower, since you can&#x27;t really die).<p>I think the ever-increasing computer horsepower and network speed is contributing to us wanting more of a simulation/charicature of real-life than a fixed set of games to play.<p>I wonder if we&#x27;ll continue on this trend in the future to the point where it&#x27;s truly more entertaining to play inside a simulation than live real life (I know you can argue that is already true for some games, but I mean much more common).",1388731938

In the UK, for example, car insurance for individuals usually covers at social, domestic  and pleasure use (&#x27;SD&P&#x27;).

Neither of these include using the car for deliveries or other things that are &#x27;for hire or reward&#x27;.<p>Anyway, from my reading of the article, the key point is that Uber buys insurance which is meant to bridge the gap between the insurance the drivers already have (e.g. SD&P) and what they&#x27;re doing (for hire or reward) but that the insurance may not do this exactly, leaving some unavoidable activity uninsured.",1388731875

7004463,comment,7002491,7004309,1,0,stan_rogers,,,"English and the protolanguages preceding it certainly were morphologically complex. English, though, has gone through a couple-three near-pidginizing events along the way that have made it a much simpler, more telegraphic language than it, in most ways, <i>should</i> be. Some aspects of the Celtic languages that were on the ground before English hit Great Britain have worked their way into the grammar (present progressive and do-support). The evidence seems to show that much of the inflective complexity was on its way out after the Vikings made the scene (the languages, Old Norse and Old English, were close enough to allow a degree of mutual comprehension, but differences in case markings, verb endings and the always-arbitrary grammatical gender made a hard-enough task more difficult than it needed to be). And one can hardly say that the influence of Norman French on the language was slight. Remember that the purpose of language is to communicate, so the long-term linguistic homogeneity of the group largely controls how complex the language can become. &quot;City&quot; languages tend to be much simpler (on average) than &quot;forest&quot; languages because outsiders rarely have to learn that 700-speaker language.<p>The surface grammar — what actually comes out of the speaker&#x27;s mouth — doesn&#x27;t <i>directly</i> reflect the underlying grammar/syntax, though. The 25-syllable Cree word will tree in pretty much the same way as the 18-word English sentence it replaces. The tonal variations a native English speaker uses convey the same information as the pragmatic particles a Mandarin speaker has to include at the end of every utterance. (We literates are often prone to forgetting that these squiggly marks are to language what choreographic notation is to dance or staff notation is to music.) We might not always be aware of the mechanics of including things like evidential marking, ergativity or pragmatics, but we do it nonetheless. And we&#x27;ve replaced (for the moment, at least) most of our tense and case markings with entire words. The syntax is structurally the same, we just add the word &quot;from&quot; instead of adding the ablative case ending. And really, does anybody actually <i>need</i> grammatical gender? (See Twain&#x27;s <i>The Awful German language</i> for a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.)",1388731470

Electric cars for everyone? Sure, give it a try. All that can be lost is a little money, and maybe you make a huge fortune and change the world. Isolated government programs can be a similar story -- e.g. NASA, which is unlikely to lose anything but a small amount of money but can be really inspiring or create some great things.<p>However, when it comes to government policy, the downside can be utter disaster. It pays to be a little skeptical that the &quot;help the poor&quot; bill (or whatever other utopian title) will actually deliver as advertised. Or skeptical that a war will be a simple in-and-out proposition.<p>Or some things just have little upside. We see this all the time in engineering. Someone wants to use a fad technology or model of some kind, or wants to reimplement something to be a little faster, or whatever. There&#x27;s huge project risk that it could derail other projects and destabilize the entire product -- which is fine if you&#x27;re going to change the world with it, but not fine for a 10% speedup on some specific workload.<p>Moral of story: optimism and &quot;can do&quot; attitude is good when the upside is huge and the downside is contained (like in a startup).

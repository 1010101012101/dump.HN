One is a horribly designed complex language with macro-like templates rather than modular parametric polymorphism. The other is much more well designed but, as you say, still complicated. You could have stayed at Scala without degrading into a comparison with C++, which is a universally kicked dog anyways.<p>It is possible to do type parameters in a way that is simple yet effective. But I can understand why it wasn&#x27;t done this early in Go&#x27;s lifetime, especially since Rob Pike isn&#x27;t exactly well into generics (vs. Odersky&#x27;s experience with Java/Pizza).",1404093584

7963302,comment,7963118,7963212,2,0,dlisboa,,,"There are some ways, I&#x27;m just thinking off the top of my head for one here.<p>If the resources of the car were mapped and had states it could work fine with a full REST interface. You could change the state of the horn like you change the state of a switch. You&#x27;d change the horn to be &quot;on&quot;, not call some &quot;turn it on&quot; procedure.<p>They have some indications of that. There&#x27;s a URL that returns the state of the vehicle (driving and position). That&#x27;s something that could be mapped as a first-class citizen and someone could mess with it with the semantics of the verbs.<p>Commands are a much more RPC area though, REST doesn&#x27;t map perfectly. You can almost always make a command into something of a resource state change, it just isn&#x27;t always simpler. REST wouldn&#x27;t give them much in this case as it&#x27;s hard to imagine they&#x27;d make use of any of REST advantages. Not that there wouldn&#x27;t be any technically (being able to evolve APIs without breaking clients is a pretty big advantage, plus plenty of other things), but that for their business it doesn&#x27;t matter (they control every client).",1404093414

While you may have only given $15, you gave it and that in and of itself means just as much as any donation if not more. I wish there were better alternatives available to help offset medical expenses, however, despite being considered one of the wealthiest nations on the planet those that control that wealth see no need to share it. Our politicians vote in favor of those who have the money to keep them elected and see no need to actually care for the rest of us. Honestly, one of the statements I made to some friends and family earlier today was that I a) hope to survive and beat this cancer and b) win the lottery so that I can give away millions to help others who have found them in similar situations. I see no need to accumulate material possessions or wealth while others suffer. It&#x27;s not in my nature to condone suffering and in the last few months I&#x27;ve found so many others who have had their own series of unfortunate events similar to mine which have left them in horrible places. Whether me meet our goal or not, the world will eventually know my story and those that have helped me. So once again, thank you for both the donation and the shoulder squeeze.

It does look a little amateurish. Seeing the pictures of the past shipments helped up the confidence and the YouTube videos did that as well. While I only watched one video, I think you could include more branding. Throw a 3 or 4 second blurb in the beginning with just your web address and tagline, and maybe a 15 or 30 second message at the end. These videos with show up for people who do Google searches Japanese candy. That&#x27;s your target market. Also include a little about the service in the video description. I think you are missing an opportunity to be able to add unobtrusive advertising.<p>I&#x27;d slightly disagree with icushman&#x27;s take on the logo, the photography and who the service is broadcast to. I think King&#x27;s &quot;claim&quot; on the candy logo is fleeting and probably doesn&#x27;t have must effect on a customer. The &quot;man-of-the-people candy blog&quot; guy is exactly the sort of person I would order something like this from. I have more confidence thinking this is legit if it is a candy aficionado behind it than someone who is in it for the business aspect. Also, I think that the anime/manga vibe of the cartoon is fine. I&#x27;d think that anyone who was turned off by that wouldn&#x27;t have been interested in ordering Japanese candy to begin with.<p>Getting back to the web site, I&#x27;d say try to highlight the testimonials from other websites more. On first pass, I missed those at the top. Highlight them more, maybe run them across the page as is the trend these days. You also ask people to subscribe before they have seen anything of what the service is.<p>The &quot;Are you still active?&quot; section implies to me there was a problem. It makes it seem as if customers are asking you questions like, &quot;Hey, it&#x27;s been a while, am I going to get a box or what&quot; or &quot;You had an interruption in service, did you get back up and running again?&quot;<p>Finally, maybe have a section for testimonials. Maybe even have your customers send a picture of themselves enjoying the box, preferably outside in a way which shows the different parts of the world you send to. It would speak a lot to legitimacy and even community.<p>Either way, congrats on passing the $10K MRR threshold, you are obviously doing a lot of things right. Cheers and best of luck!",1404090849

What I like about Go is the abstraction tools are primitive and allow for consistent & precise expression. The expression may not be as concise in certain cases, however, you can build in the mechanisms into your architecture.<p>> But, for systems programming, abstractions suck. They always, always have a cost. When abstractions break, you not only have to deal with a broken system but the broken abstraction itself too. (Anyone who has ever seen a gcc compiler error for C++ knows how this feels.)<p>That is why custom abstractions to your problem domain are important. A framework or a language with lots of features will get you started quickly by providing out-of-the-box tools that you can hang your program architecture on.

It makes a lot of concessions to practicality, C-like syntax and imperative control flow being high among them.<p>Perhaps I wasn&#x27;t clear in the post you&#x27;re responding to: my point was that both Rust and Haskell are fairly &quot;simple&quot; programming languages which <i>seem</i> more complicated, because they introduce a lot of features which are likely to be new to those who are using it for the first time. I wasn&#x27;t really comparing them <i>as languages</i> per se; that&#x27;s a separate discussion.<p>> Common in any language, including Go.<p>Higher-order functions are common in most languages, but not in the way that Haskell does. Most languages use first-class functions as lists of instructions (do some stuff, and perform the steps in this argument). Haskell makes them truly first-class, such that they&#x27;re positively ubiquitous: an example is currying, which is everywhere in Haskell and rare in most other languages; another example is monads, which are obviously a core part of Haskell and which require first-class functions (e.g. in >>=) to do anything useful. There are other examples.<p>> Rust does not have these.<p>I know; I was speaking about Haskell.<p>> This is because we want memory safety without performance tradeoffs (global concurrent garbage collection).<p>Right; it&#x27;s a perfectly understandable thing to have, but it&#x27;s not something that (to my knowledge) exists in any other mainstream language. It&#x27;s an example of something in Rust which is obscure to newcomers.<p>> Could you elaborate?<p>I&#x27;d have to write some code and run the compiler to get the actual error message, but I recall getting errors about using some reference outside of a context or something. In my fuzzy recollection, it would be something like where I had written `match foo { a => b; c => d}` and I would get some error message which would be fixed by writing `let foo1 = foo; match foo1 {a => b; c => d}`. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t remember the specifics, but long story short: compiling Rust code produces a lot of very strange error messages to someone unfamiliar with the language. :) In this way it&#x27;s not dissimilar from Haskell.<p>> This is because dynamically-sized types are not yet implemented, but they will be for 1.0.<p>Great to know!

You will continue to ignore and discount what I say while accusing me over and over of being a bigot.<p>In your world, birth, breastfeeding and hormones exist equally for men and women.  There is a basic equivalence.<p>In my world, childbirth is a very intense and somewhat risky experience that women have no choice about going through after they become pregnant and choose not to abort.  Breastfeeding is significant experience that women may choose to go through as well.<p>In my world, men have a choice about whether and to what extent they we choose to be involved in parenting.  Men who choose to parent will experience hormones, etc that may catch us by surprise.  But we can choose not to parent, and if we do we will have no hormonal impact.<p>In my world, an intense and risky experience that you are committed to going through is in no way equal to being able to choose doing nothing.  In my world acknowledging that something intense and risky is actually intense and risky is not bigotry.  Bigotry would be categorically choosing to not give someone an opportunity for fear of the risk.  But acknowledging that it is real is called honesty.<p>Now if you want to actually learn more about the important hormones and their effects, I suggest that you start with the big one, oxytocin.<p>You may have the pleasure of the final response.  Unless you say something truly shocking, I won't be bothering to respond to you any more.  We've both said enough that people should be able to decide what they do and do not agree with.",1342821127

This was my first encounter with the rigid structure of American college essays. Initially I found it silly and counterproductive, but I have since softened my stance. My wife, despite having a degree from a top university in her country, had hardly any practice writing essays even in her native language. Because of that, she has had her hands full just worrying about her ideas and how to express them in correct and idiomatic English, so the fixed structure has been invaluable for her--it helps organize her thoughts and removes one whole class of tricky decisions from the writing process.<p>Think of it as training wheels.

I believe it comes out of the hubris that a particular variety of rationalist has about the nature of knowledge.  Some people only want truth to be the things which are tractable by science and are in a hurry to reduce the possibilities to materialism and determinism in pursuit of this goal.  They trot out all manner of superficial evidence (such as this brain-activity-before-awareness study) that is nothing more than affirming the conclusion in the face of such overarching philosophical questions.  When confronted with the possibilities borne of dualism or other philosophies they invoke Occam's razor and denounce such arguments as irrational appeals to the ""supernatural"".<p>In my opinion, these people are just bad philosophers.  It's no different than a theologian coming in and trying to hamfistedly do science with a preexisting agenda.  You can't do good philosophy if you worship at the altar of scienceyou need to be a bit more comfortable with the unknown and indeed unknowability.<p>For me personally, the reason I can't dismiss free will is simply because of consciousness itself.  The fact that I am aware of my thoughts is to me more valid evidence of free will than all the logical machinations that someone can contrive to support the opposite.  Even if the universe <i>is</i> deterministic and free will <i>is</i> an illusion, it doesn't mean we can predict anyone's actions, and if we can't do that then what does it mean to say free will isn't real?  Maybe chaos and entropy also don't exist, but if we can't compute them then they are a perfectly secure ""illusion"".<p>Ugh, I'm sorry to waste my time and yours, but it really <i>really</i> bothers me when people demonstrate so much smug hubris about such a wonderfully large philosophical question.",1342818924
4272929,comment,4271269,4272832,2,0,ezyang,,,"Yes, transaction fees are a big problem. One possibility is to not pay any fees: currently, there is a social convention that if all outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger, and so if we're not mixing too many addresses together, we can do the transaction for free. But once the intrinsic benefits of mining taper out, one would expect transaction costs to eventually become non-zero.<p>In this case, the transaction fee will have to be paid out of another wallet, not subtracted from the BTC involved in the transaction. Furthermore, this wallet must also be anonymous (e.g. to get anonymity, you must have some anonymity to begin with). But an important concern is how to pay for the transaction, when the size of Bitcoin you are anonymizing is about the same amount of the transaction cost anyway! One mitigating factor may be that it is really easy to find lots of participants willing to perform this mix, so a few benificient participants (who ostensibly want to be able to mix things) pay the entirety of the transaction fee for large, mini-mixes, and then uses the results of the mini-mix to pay for their bigger mixing.",1342818922

Sending email when registering a new user, for example, should be in the if user.save branch in your controllers or, if you have a more SOAish app, in the service that creates users.<p>def create\n  user = User.create(params[:user])<p><pre><code>  if user.save\n    Emailer.new_user_email.deliver\n    render 'welcome'\n  else\n    render 'oh shit'\n  end</code></pre>\nend<p>Or, refactor that out a bit (ONLY IF NECESSARY!)<p>def create\n  user = UserService.create_user_from(params[:user])<p><pre><code>  if user\n    render 'welcome'\n  else \n    render 'oh shit'\n  end</code></pre>\nend",1342818020

I sure would (though I'd use the money to start a new one ;-)).",1342818004

Many a CS professor may disagree, and for the true hardcore CS students, JS will only take you so far. But for the average high school student who has no desire or need to understand the complexities of compilation, GUI libraries, memory allocation, etc., Javascript is a great way to learn programming quickly and visually without the ""voodoo"" involved in getting a C script to run.<p>Not to mention, limited experience with HTML/CSS/JS is probably far better on the resume/useful in the job market than limited experience in C/Java/Python.",1217001530
256748,comment,256355,256355,0,0,sungam,,,"In this study the authors measured the activity of most of the genes in the worm genome and found that quite a large number change in activity ‘expression’ in old versus young worms. In general, for most genes, the amount of protein produced from that gene is proportional to the amount of messenger RNA transcribed. Transcription factors are proteins that regulate (either increase or decrease) the production of messenger RNA. In this article the authors found evidence that decreased levels of one particular transcription factor ‘elt-3’ may account for many of the other changes in gene expression at old age. They showed that elt-3 levels decreased with age and that this was caused by an increase in the expression of two other transcription factors ‘elt-5’ and ‘elt-6’ which normally repress elt-3 expression. They show that if the levels of elt-5 and elt-6 are experimentally reduced then elt-3 does not decrease with age and the worms live longer. They propose that an increase in elt-5 / elt-6 is a normal part of worm development but that it continues inappropriately into adulthood where it has deleterious effects that lead to aging. This is potentially interesting because to date there has been a huge amount of evidence supporting the ‘unrepaired damage’ theories of aging; this is the first evidence that aging can be a consequence of inappropriate regulation of developmental pathways.<p>However this study has a number of limitations. Firstly, experimental removal of elt-3 expression has no effect on lifespan whatever despite causing the same changes in gene expression that are seen at old age. Secondly, experimental reduction of elt-5 / elt-6 only increased maximum lifespan from 20 to 24 days – other mutations, such as the daf-2 mutation, increase maximal lifespan to close to 50 days. Finally they do not address the mechanism of increased elt-5 / elt-6 expression with age beyond speculating that it is a disregulated developmental process; it is entirely possible that changes in expression of these factors are simply a downstream consequence of some other aging related change. Finally even if it were proven that aging in C elegans is programmed like Salmon which die soon after breeding, this would likely have no relevance to much longer living organisms such as mammals which almost certainly age by different mechanisms.",1217001386

There is a 15 point difference between the mean IQ of European-descended (white) Americans and African-descended (black) Americans  Please note this is something You Can't Say so don't speak publicly of it.<p>The most interesting thing to note here is that white players score about half a standard deviation higher than the national white IQ, and black players score about half half a standard deviation higher than the national black IQ.  Since life is sort of an IQ test, this isn't too surprising.  There are a lot bad decisions you can make to screw up your football career before making the NFL - a higher IQ will keep you away from these things.<p>As always Steve Sailer is indispensable in these matters: ""Are football players dumb? Actually, they are fairly smart. The NFL requires draft prospects to take the Wonderlic IQ test. Offensive guards averaged 107, centers and punters 106, quarterbacks and kickers 104. The speed positions averaged lower: halfbacks, free safeties, cornerbacks, and wide receivers averaged from 91 to 94. Still, at both the white positions and the black positions, prospects scored about a half standard deviation higher than the respective white and black national means.<p>Of course, IQ tests do a lousy job of measuring improvisational mental ability, which football players, especially the black ones, are particularly good at.

In those areas, the price of housing must eventually fall to the marginal cost of production.  In areas where zoning laws and density make new construction very difficult ( Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, New York) housing prices remain very high.  Houses have essentially become collectibles ( like paintings or baseball cards).  Because you can't create more of them, the price holds up against an inflating dollar.",1216998514

256673,comment,256294,256294,0,0,biohacker42,,,"Let me attempt to respond to the points in the article in order:<p>1. As someone born and raised behind the iron curtain, let me tell you the SU would have absolutely expanded if the US hadn't checked it. It then <i>still</i> would have collapsed. But that doesn't mean that holding off the SU was not worth it. Now the way it was done is some specific instances like Vietnam, sure that execution was bad in more ways then one. But the general idea, not all bad.<p>2. There is room in the market for both durable durables, and disposable durables. When I was a poor student I could only afford the planned obsolescence stuff. Now that I'm a well paid C++ developer, I just spend $50+ on a kitchen knife. The damn thing better last :)<p>3. The American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation didn't turn me into a Libertarian, growing up behind the iron curtain did.<p>4. Planned obsolescence is not the only thing to be blamed for the US trade deficit. Europe and Japan rebuilt their industries from scratch. The US still had the <i>burden</i> of un-bombed factories.<p>5. Have you ever tried to join a union? It's a serious question. Not start a union, but join an existing one. Unions are not for immigrants, can you think of why?<p>6. ""... the wholesale deindustrialization of America"" Uhm, the US manufacturing is doing pretty well right now, with the cheap $. Could it be that antiquated companies were simply out competed and went bust.<p>7. It is worth noting that opening trade <i>did</i> dump a HUGE cheap labor force on the global market. That absolutely did cost some high paying jobs in the first world. But wages in China are already rising. Besides, what right do YOU have to a high paying job that someone in India does not?<p>8. As someone here pointed out, SUVs were very profitable for US car manufactures. One airline, I think SouthWest, saw where oil is going and hedged well. I think they are hedged for the next 10 years of something like that. As I mentioned before, the US car manufacturers should have seen the same trend in oil, but they didn't.<p>9. It was Gorbachev. Trust me, it was. What he <i>didn't</i> do was crush the protest in the Baltic states, and Poland, and East Germany right quick, <i>not</i> sending in the tanks sealed the SU's faith.<p>10. Yeah, Russia bounced back in 10 short years after a crushing fall in living standards. Don't worry, the US can do the same. We should hope it does better, but it can surely do at least as good.<p>11. US inflation hurts the holders of US dept and currency, guess who.<p>12. I have to agree with you on the neocons, those are some crazy fuckers.<p>13. Pressure to keep feeding the military machine doesn't just come from generals. Little towns where a military contractor is the biggest employers put a lot more pressure on.<p>14. Yeah NATO expands, what's a huge international bureaucracy to do, shrink? As if. Also with Russia and its sabre rattling us ex-satellite really did want to join.<p>15. I agree again, neocons are not only scary, they're dumb too.<p>16.  The Fed lowered rates because of 9/11. True, should they have allowed a terrorist attack to sound the start of a recession? I would say yes, but it is not a black and white issue.<p>17. The US currency collapses, imports become prohibitively expensive. The standard of living drops, and then the recovery starts. Life goes on.",1216998005

If you need to work with several people putting a report together, Google Docs is a great way to get started. We often eventually take it out of Docs into a desktop program to finish it off, but Google Docs is one of the best ways to collaborate.<p>How the IT department didn't know what its students, faculty and staff were doing is kind of hard to believe. For students and teachers in particular, Google Docs is a big deal. It's not just because it's a cloud version of Office, but rather that it has things that Office can't do that are especially important in a university setting.",1361282378

We are trying to solve that problem by allowing merchants to add revisits to a user's profile when they revisit without a deal. At the same time users are given incentives to revisit by awarding them loyalty points. The more they revisit the merchant, the more loyalty points they get. So this is a win-win-win situation<p>3) Users are also given other incentives like unlocking badges on buying more deals in a category.<p>4) We are trying to popularize the use of QR Code by emails the user a QR code on purchase of a deal.

5244188,comment,5243908,5243908,35,0,mcherm,,,"They're attacking the wrong part of the problem.<p>If misleading messages (""phishing"") are leading their users to enter credentials onto forms which are then used to send out spam, then the solution is not to block access to one of the sites that supports forms. There are an unlimited number of sites that support forms. There are LOTS of better ways to solve this problem. Here are a few:<p>* Train your users where it is and isn't safe to enter credentials.<p>* Don't give your users credentials. Have some alternate way to authenticate them like a login token.<p>* Put rate limiting on the ability of a single account to send out emails.<p>Blocking the site for just a few hours as an emergency response to a short-term attack is a much more reasonable approach. Sometimes, to react quickly, you need to take measures that are not the best possible choice. But there were better approaches, and the security team should take measures to ensure that they can react more effectively next time. For instance, in this case, a single mass-email or email ""virus"" had gone out and was tempting a large number of users to give out their credentials. Instead of blocking the site that was collecting the credentials, a better solution would have been to remove the email from the mailboxes of all the students. After all, the emails system is provided by the university, and this cuts off the problem at the root. They should institute the necessary technology to support doing this next time they have a phishing problem... perhaps they can even do this proactively: set up some honeypot accounts not receiving any legitimate emails and automatically destroy any emails matching the signature of emails received by these honeypot accounts (with manual review afterward to correct for false positives).",1361281621

We're outlawing doing certain kinds of reverse engineering, we're making copyright violations a criminal offense, and so forth. (Most of our government reaction has been in the form of protecting large industries).<p>Some other countries are seeing crackdowns on where you can go on the internet, who you can talk to. To those countries, individuals simply having the power to gather information is too much for them.<p>I hate to make cataclysmic predictions, but I think the U.S. is going to get pulled more and more into your house and head. Where you surf, what you consume, what kinds of things you print on your 3-D printers. 3-D printing is the thing that is going to change everything, because now we can <i>make</i> whatever we need without having to rely on established patterns of commerce (which the government can control).<p>If it helps any, I don't think this is some sort of deliberate power grab. Quite frankly I don't think the people we have running things are anywhere near qualified enough to be making the decisions they are, On top of that, we have no examples throughout history of a government with the ability to control and monitor so much of each person's life. There's no precedent.<p>3-D printing, to me, is the one tech that over the next 50 years or so will dramatically change everything. Robots are a close second. Fun times to be alive!

Often, way too often, compilers fail, hardware fails, operating systems fail, lots of things fail.  I am not going to read the millions of lines of code written by other programmers (in f-ing emacs no less) in the any number of differing complex beasts, the compilers. It seems crazy-making to me, that other programmers would create compilers that would use millions of possibilities of optimizing a single line of mine using hundreds of different optimization techniques based on a vast amount of academic research that I won't be spending years getting at. I do feel embarrassed, yes very icky, that I have little to no idea what a three-line loop will be compiled as, but bloat would be my guess. There is risk in going to great lengths of optimization or doing the dirtiest tricks. And if I don't want the compiler to do this, I have no idea how to stop this behavior, nor do I want to invest in the specific knowledge of the nuances any particular compiler.  The compiler does not allow me easy access because the compiler itself is an overly complex piece of software written by other programmers. I could care less about how a compiler would make my code would look in assembly, on different processor architectures and different operating systems and in different assembly conventions. Transformation comes with how we as programmers write code, not in compiler-fu.<p>P.S. Oh, and by the way if I really wasn't using half of the code I wrote, I would throw the source code away.",1361279443

I don't mean to suggest that they have not produced any exciting news in a while, but that this is service is so exciting because it will fundamentally change how a lot of people use AWS.<p>Of particular interest to me is how this will affect platforms like Heroku. After the recent routing mesh debacle a number of people contacted me to discuss migrating their application from Heroku to AWS.<p>My Heroku -> AWS migration procedure is already pretty straightfoward:<p>- identify Heroku services<p>- write Puppet manifests to manage EC2 instances<p>- write CloudFormation stacks to control other aspects of the infrastructure, e.g. autoscaling and S3 buckets<p>- write deploy scripts so clients can continue using git-based deploys<p>OpsWorks is only going to make this migration easier, and will have the additional benefit of letting my clients manage more of their own infrastructure without my help. Training people to change autoscaling group configuration via a web interface is one thing, training them to update CloudFormation stacks is a little less user-friendly.<p>From the clients I have spoken to, the key benefits of Heroku are a) git-based deploys and b) easy scaling configuration by a web interface. All of these things are possible with AWS, albeit a little more difficult to set up - especially in the case of scaling configuration - and OpsWorks is going to close the gap even further.<p>If AWS can provide most of these services directly, will people still be willing to pay the Heroku premium?<p>There is one downside to the OpsWorks announcement, at least from my personal perspective. I'm currently writing a book on AWS System Administration, and I've almost finished the chapter describing various Puppet workflows. Like many other commenters I was undecided whether I should focus on Chef or Puppet, given their relatively similar feature set and popularity. I'm not sure if I've backed the wrong horse here and should rewrite the chapter using Chef, or if having a Puppet-perspective would be useful. Any thoughts?",1361279116

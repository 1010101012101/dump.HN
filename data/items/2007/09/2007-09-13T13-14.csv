54193,comment,53327,53895,0,0,yubrew,,,"Cooking for yourself definitely saves time.  Are you counting travel time and time spent waiting in line?  But it does take slightly more effort, and require the right tools.<p>You can always stick to the basics.  
Ramen takes ~10 minutes for boiling water and clean up.
Chicken breast takes 2 minutes to season, 14 minutes to cook and clean.  Tuna takes no effort right out of the can.
Boil or steam vegetables for about 5 to 10 minutes.
Rice or oatmeal are cheap sources for carbs.  <p>With these ingredients, you can eat well for under $10 / day where I live (Providence, RI).  Just make sure you invest in a good spice rack.",1189689180
54192,comment,54000,54185,0,0,brlewis,,,"I'm not disagreeing with you, but I think it's important not to conflate the concepts of Lisp's ease of reading/writing arbitrary data and Lisp's ability to read/write programs using the same facilities.<p>Using Lisp to read and write a configuration file means you don't need to worry about lexing and parsing either.  If you don't use Lisp, or if you don't use S-expressions, you will need to lex and parse the configuration file just to read it, compiler or no compiler.<p>Depending what domain you program in, a Lisp programmer may not ever need to think about lexing and parsing.  I tried a little googling to make sure I was remembering their definitions right and actually didn't come up with anything.  From memory, lexing is splitting the input stream up into tokens, and parsing is structuring those tokens into a parse tree.  If I'm remembering wrong, re-read the prior paragraph temporarily using those definitions and it will make sense.",1189689153

7174496,comment,7173710,7173999,3,0,heyheyhey,,,"> I&#x27;m aware this happened with Season Four of Arrested Development. There was a massive hype right up until it was to premiere on Netflix and then … nothing. People watched it, then moved on.<p>This pretty much happened with HoC season 1 as well.  Massive hype for this Fincher/Spacey series and then... nothing until a month or two ago for season 2.  On the contrary, shows like &quot;Orange is the new black&quot; didn&#x27;t have much hype initially and slowly grew as more and more people binged through it and became pretty popular.<p>Andy Greenwald said it best: &quot;I’ve argued before that encouraging this sort of bingeing does no favors to the art or the audience. It takes a pleasantly coursed dinner party and transforms it into a hot dog eating contest.&quot;\n<a href=""http://grantland.com/features/breaking-bad-black-mirror-year-television/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grantland.com/features/breaking-bad-black-mirror-year...</a>",1391471928

The web is also rapidly evolving its capabilities, so web applications are constantly changing in nature.<p>YAFS is not really the problem, it&#x27;s a symptom of a massively developed for, single language, massively used platform.

Shows like Breaking Bad have enough depth that it&#x27;s worth it to watch them a second time.<p>Still, I doubt the release-all-at-once dynamic will be the norm in 3 years, but I doubt we&#x27;ll have the arbitrary winter breaks designed to make sure the season finale lands in the 20s of May. I could see an every-two-days release cycle being the norm (so a show like House of Cards would unfold over a month).",1391471880

The <i>important</i> question is &quot;how much do humans affect the warming of the earth?&quot;  To date, we have not been able to determine this <i>accurately</i> because there are so many factors (our CO2 emissions, emissions from cows, volcanoes, under-sea vents, emissions reduced by trees and plants, increased output from the sun, etc - let alone measuring one of these accurately across the globe).  A million variables, no way to isolate any two of them.  There might be a &quot;consensus&quot; but that does not guarantee accuracy - I encourage you to write a computer program that will determine the global temperature next year, and see how accurate your prediction is - you will likely find it impossible, because among other things you do not know which volcanoes will erupt and how much more radiation the sun will output.  10-20 years ago, the consensus was that sea levels would rise by a few meters, but that has not happened.",1391471524

In a slightly different domain, I saw this back when I was doing NT programming in the &#x27;90s.  From the start it provided threads and plenty of thread safe stuff (and plenty not, including the MCV++ Standard Template Library in 1997, although that was mostly of an initial botch of the port from the HP? code), and this made quite a difference compared to trying to write threaded programs for UNIX(TM).<p>If you&#x27;re not going to limit yourself to copying paradigms like the Actor model I argue you&#x27;re going to be in for a world of hurt, even as your ecosystem matures, because you&#x27;ll almost certainly have non-thread safe stuff from the days when the community wasn&#x27;t considering threading.<p>So all I&#x27;m saying in this argument is that Common Lisp is traversing this painful path, and will never be as optimal as it might be, because when it was cast into concrete in 1984 threads weren&#x27;t part of it.<p>The Clojure argument for standard data structure syntax-literals, and strict limits on reader macros, is indeed legibility, defined as portability between humans.  I think it&#x27;s an issue, but one that I think we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree on.  Although I don&#x27;t see gaining CL compatibility as a goal, the foundations of the languages are too different (functional vs. multiparadigm <i>including</i> but not limited to functional).<p>I agree that age itself isn&#x27;t a good criticism, I was pointing out how Common Lisp&#x27;s extreme age has resulted in issues, and &quot;age criticisms&quot; could be interpreted that way.<p>This goes all the way back all the way to the very first late &#x27;50s LISP, e.g. while I personally like them, classic examples are Contents of the Address Register and Contents of the Decrement Register (car and cdr) of the vacuum tube IBM 704.  More consequential are things like Lisp-2 vs. Lisp-1; maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of taste and not having written enough macros in my career but I prefer the latter.<p>Hmmm, to sum up, one argument for Clojure is that we now known enough to create a more restrictive dialect and benefit from the good taste of Rick Hickey and now others who are helping to carry the language&#x27;s torch.  Callow youth though he might be, mrottenkolber is spot on when he says it&#x27;s an opinionated language, and that&#x27;ll certainly mean among other things that it&#x27;ll not be to many experienced Lisper&#x27;s taste (probably easier if you&#x27;re a Schemer, though).<p>I harp on SMP programming because I find it, and the functional programming solutions to it, very interesting, not to mention it&#x27;s just plain better for writing robust software.  Closure seems to have done a good job using the latter to address the former, and gaining those other minor details guaranteed FP grants you.",1391470036

That being said, the dream of having a matlab like prototyping environment directly result in production level HPC code is probably never going to be realised in Fortran - maybe Julia will get there? All I can say is that the tooling needs to be top notch for that to happen and the performance can&#x27;t just be in the order of magnitude of Fortran/C - it needs to be within 20% or so. Once you run software on clusters that cost millions, programmer time becomes rather cheap, especially in academic settings.",1391469033

This is an option now and with sound strategy could be used in various scenarios.<p>The NSA is successful now because of computational power and obscurity.

At some point, if the campaign is successful, they will have to appeal to the people for money, i.e. some tax to do it. Maybe it will be defense spending, or maybe it will be energy tax.

This might not apply to Dell but it applies to a lot of small business owners who need the extra help until they get paid by their clients and then pay off the short term loan. Stricter payroll loan policies (when money is scarce = bank reaching low levels of liquidity) puts businesses in tough situations leading to sudden layoffs.<p>The Fed&#x27;s goal is to try and regain control of the system (they lost control last summer).

Some people will watch the entire season at once, some will watch an episode per night, and so on. It makes it difficult to discuss the show with anyone because you first have to establish how much each of you have watched. Does it make discussion impossible? Absolutely not, but it presents a barrier.<p>– On the other end of the spectrum, limiting the availability of a show&#x27;s back catalog will obviously limit a show&#x27;s audience. Most of the successful shows of the past few years grew their audience over time, which requires access to that back catalog. Netflix, being the most popular service for this kind of thing, is the logical place to license your content if you care about improving your show&#x27;s future prospects. Again, not being on Netflix does not make it impossible to catch up, but it presents another barrier.<p>Breaking Bad is the ideal example for this model. It&#x27;s a great show that built its audience through word-of-mouth; if their back catalog wasn&#x27;t available, the word-of-mouth recommendation would be DOA because most people would not have broken through the barrier. Similarly, if they had just dumped season 5 onto Netflix, it would have eliminated the week-over-week hype cycle that built over the course of the season and climaxed with a finale that was watched 700% more than the show&#x27;s pilot.<p>Also, releasing every episode at once almost entirely eliminates cliffhangers.

First, go for correctness. Perfect the algorithm and sensors, get the car working. Then look at scaling down the technology and making it cheaper. The fact that Google doesn&#x27;t make cars (a point the author made) is kind of irrelevant, because this is a sensor/control/software problem, not a car problem.<p>Recognize that BMW/Daimler/et al really don&#x27;t want true self driving cars. It&#x27;s not really in their interest, because it would radically reduce the need for car ownership and would open up a new world of on-the-fly car rental. Human drivers required = good business. I&#x27;m not saying its a conspiracy, just that they have no passion to disrupt their industry in this way.<p>Even the cost is somewhat moot if the business model is different. Let&#x27;s say the Google Car sensor package costs $100,000. That&#x27;s cost prohibitive for individual ownership, but it would not be a problem for a business model like ZipCar + Uber, where you call a car on your mobile phone to get you, and &#x27;rent it&#x27; for a short self-driving or assisted trip.  If car use moves from ownership to renting, then many people can spread the cost of the sensors.",1382590239

Sure, you can interact with TFS from the CLI (and maybe it&#x27;s better, I don&#x27;t know) but the first exposure most have to it is GUI so you learn that way.  That&#x27;s just one example but Visual Studio et. al. tend to take care of many things I use the CLI for on OS X/Linux systems, via a GUI.  I&#x27;m certainly not saying it&#x27;s better but it <i>is</i> better than most CLI-gone-GUI tools I&#x27;ve used in the FOSS world.  I think this is because Windows dev tools are built for the GUI first (and often have a complete lack of, or a lacking support for, CLI UX) first as opposed to many FOSS tools that assume an understanding of the CLI and are built for that first.  Personally I enjoy CLI and, while it has a steeper learning curve, I am more productive with my definition of a &quot;proper&quot; CLI (bash, zsh, etc.) than without.  So I am attempting to learn Powershell in order to regain some of lost productivity on Windows.  But, that&#x27;s just me.

It&#x27;s absolutely brilliant in its sheer audacity. You get to keep your campaign contributions from the rent-seeking financial cartels, whilst simultaneously providing VCs with their retail lambs for the slaughter. The fact that they do this, whilst selling the idea as a positive act for the public has me slack jawed.

Congress is hoping that by using Internet crowdfunding, small and promising companies could gather capital needed to grow and expand from a wide pool of investors.</i><p>So we invent seat belts, and people stop dying. After a while people forget why we had seat belts in the first place. Let&#x27;s take away the seat belts, because look, no one has died in a really long time.<p>Furthermore, why on earth would MORE risky companies need LESS disclosure. That makes no sense. If you were thinking halfway straight, you&#x27;d realize that it&#x27;s the small ones that are the most subject to corruption, pump and dump scams and extensive stock promotion. Penny stocks CLEARLY indicate that this is the case. We need MORE disclosure not less. Costs are entirely derived from the IPO cartel. Break that you morons.

Very personal indeed, and if he wasn&#x27;t already a completely tortured soul, that would be more than enough to take away any shred of sense he had made of the world. Give enough cash and free time to someone who has been cracked like that and he quite easily can end up dead from an existential crisis with no practical boundaries.<p>Considering this was some 25 years ago now, if he thought about intellectual property issues at all, the mindset at that time was very reasonable in that your source code and executable was considered copyrightable like a book - it didn&#x27;t matter if it provided the same functionality as someone else&#x27;s program as long as you wrote the code. Just consider the fate of the original spreadsheet for confirmation of this.<p>To summarize, before you take any stand against the tragedy that is the life of PK, consider that there is probably a huge concentration of people very much like the early Phil Katz right here on HN.

After completing bachelors degree in CS from university, I started masters. Had to drop out due to illness. Joined a company after a year. Company paid low salary. And lot of politics in the company. After 2 years just when things were improving, mainly the salary, I left as I hated that political environment. Started consulting and did that for many years. I earned enough to pay bills but nothing at all for medical and retirement so far. I believe I didn&#x27;t have necessary (business) skills for running successful business so I couldn&#x27;t make good money though I made clients happy. Now my gf left me as her company offered her a good role and huge salary. She thinks I am a loser. And may be she is right. All my fault. So, here I am - no money, no house, no car, no wife, no savings. Totally f4d. As you guys are among the most intelligent ones on the planet, I thought you guys could help me with a bit of your wisdom. If you were in my shoes, what would you have done to fix things? I don&#x27;t have ego problem. So, even if you are half my age, please don&#x27;t hesitate to post your advice. Thank you all in advance.",1382589409

One of the bad things is that messing with them will be too over powering to resist and that will slow their deployment.<p>The typical &quot;mess with this&quot; kind of action would be walk up on the edge of a freeway and pop up a full sized STOP sign on the shoulder. Humans will say &#x27;wtf?&#x27; and keep driving but autonomous cars, unable to know if it isn&#x27;t a legit stop sign, will slam on the brakes to stop. Resulting in hugely funny (to some) traffic jams. Similarly with inflatable stoplights.<p>Then there are the things where even human drivers have issues (a person standing on the side of the road signalling traffic to slow down).<p>There are many situations that autonomous cars will need to be able to handle, that are handled in a fail safe way today by humans, yet to be programmed. Definitely will take longer than you think.",1382588303

This is easy to fix - once 100% of a road&#x27;s cars are automated (and ideally communicate with each other), the problem of erratic driving simply disappears.<p>A question for thought: If I&#x27;m drunk in a driverless car, current laws would say that&#x27;s illegal, since I&#x27;m still the main driver. But if it&#x27;s fully automated, why should I stay sober?",1382588210

Invest in a mixture of index/mutual funds and bonds. If you need lower risk (but lower return), then tip towards more bonds.

With a tool like Procreate or one of the Autodesk apps the only difference between drawing on a computer and drawing on a tablet is that with a tablet, the tablet directly connect your pen to the digital medium and you just need the stylus.<p>When it come to making music, absolutely - for professional grade content one would need to use proper tools. I&#x27;m barely an amateur and while I enjoy recording my songs and adding to them with garage band, I&#x27;m more interested in spending my precious free time doodling with sound than trying to make a living with it. It&#x27;s better than watching commercials on network tv. Professional do use it for creating though: one example is this - <a href=""http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-04/22/trent-reznor-htda"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-04/22/trent-reznor-...</a> but there are other pros whom are turning to devices as a way to extend their creativity and enhance their performances. So, I believe that we are not far away from a device powerful enough to record, generate and mix professional quality sound for a fraction of what a recording studio of similar quality cost.<p>I do think I understand your position and you are likely correct. However there is this anecedal observation I have: people of my parents generation, when they use a smart phone; tablet or computer are very likely to consume with either email, web surfing or one variant of the addicting games that are free. However, being overly optimistic and observing my daughter and her peers as they grow up with device first and computer second I hope/believe/think (not sure if any of those words are correct but they are close) that they will have little choice but to learn to use it as the tool it is and push that to its limits and then extend it for their own purposes.<p>For the record, while I am an apple customer I&#x27;m under no illusion that their products are better or more successful than the other consumer electronics makers out there. It works for me and mine and that&#x27;s why I stay with it.

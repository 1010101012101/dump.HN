They posit some variation of: the wealthy don&#x27;t gain on the net from the security provided by the state, because they could provide their own private security more cheaply. Of course, anyone powerful enough to protect you in the absence of the state has no reason to work for you rather than enslave you. John Galt, the engineer, isn&#x27;t a free man without the state. He&#x27;s a slave to a warlord, one who puts his talents to work amassing wealth for himself.<p>That&#x27;s what makes the possibility raised by the author terrifying.

8890197,comment,8888747,8890034,0,0,Alupis,,,"> And to your point, if you the muni is responsible for little more than the fiber line itself, it really is a simple matter to maintain them, i.e. completely predictable cost structure.<p>That&#x27;s what I was talking about. However, if the muni is responsible for the entire network, ie. routing, dc&#x27;s, backup generators, upstream bandwidth, CPE devices (home termination routers/wifi access points), etc... those are all costs that might increase and/or be unpredictable, and at the very least will require some sort of re-investment from time-to-time to keep the network &quot;current&quot; in regards to technology used.<p>For example, how many years will the muni get out of the core routers they buy today? It will depend on the quality/upgradability of them when purchased, network demand/load, number of subscribers, future requirements for traffic shaping, etc. Same goes with their switches, load balancers, and other network equipment.<p>The actual lines themselves are unlikely to ever &quot;break&quot; unless someone puts a backhoe through them on a construction site, etc. So they are a relatively fixed-cost. Every home in a city could be &quot;fiber-ready&quot;, and once you move in you get a choice of local ISP to use. There would be many local ISP&#x27;s to choose from, and due to competition among themselves, service quality would increase.<p>Leaving everything to the muni also opens a door for vendors to oversell high margin equipment to the muni, effectively making the local tax-payer and/or subscriber foot the bill with little choice. Allowing small/local ISP&#x27;s to compete for the &quot;last mile&quot; can reduce that cost burden based on what that particular business chooses to run equipment-wise (and to be competitive, they will strive to do the most with what they have instead of opting for the most expensive offering from the vendor, etc).",1421282440

Your return value can, as in Go, be an error or an object of type T; unlike Go and its stunted type system, this is a generic object and so this must be written once for all types. That return value can be functionally mapped over, just like `map` in Ruby, and will return either the original exception (the mapping function will not be called) or the result of the mapping function.<p>These can be chained indefinitely. At the end you have a Try object of the generic type of the final mapping function, against which you can pattern match for Success or Failure. (Failing to compare against both Success and Failure is a compiler warning. There&#x27;s a flag, IIRC, to make it an error, but since my IDE is already yelling at me that I screwed up I don&#x27;t in practice have this problem.)<p>Additionally, at any point in the chain you can call `recover`, which is similar to `map` but for the exceptional case (Try[T] -> Try[T], with Success[T] passed through) if it&#x27;s a recoverable error.<p>All error handling--as separate from error recovery, which is rarely in practice useful--is always, always, always at the very bottom of the function, right next to the happy path. It literally is impossible to miss, and does not require <i>copy-pasting code after every library function that can fail</i>.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to check &#x27;err&#x27; every time unless your language is just straight-up too dumb to do work for you.

I was good in Math and liked computers, so I was planning on going to a normal university and just finding something in those fields (I didn&#x27;t have a major or a program in mind, I was just going to go in as &quot;undecided&quot;).<p>However, because of the cost and my own reluctance to get student loans, I ended up enrolling in a community college with the intention of just doing some basic courses for cheaper before transferring. While taking your typical math, science, history, and english courses; I also took an elective called &quot;Intro to Computer Art&quot; or something like that. Mind you, I hadn&#x27;t taken any art courses in high school at all - no music, drawing, painting, whatever; I only took the minimum requirements and then filled my extra spaces with advanced math, science, and computer science.<p>I enjoyed the elective and decided to take more in the same program (&quot;Visual Communications&quot;). I explored traditional design, web design, video editing, and 3d animation. At the end, I got my Associate degree in Graphic Design (having never had wanted to be a designer at any time before college). Of course, all the exploration meant I spent well more than 2 years there (I also took things like Astronomy, which I liked after I changed teachers).<p>From there, I found an internship through the dean of the program who forwarded me an email from a company looking for interns and, afterwards, found my first job in the field through someone I had taken a couple of classes with.<p>From there, I was able to learn development on the job and change jobs a number of times - each time for a better experience and generally better pay. From a Texas suburb, I&#x27;ve gone to Minneapolis, New York, and now the SF Bay area all based on what I initially learned from community college.<p>My case is a bit different than what the President is intending, as he seems to see it more for learning a specific skill (like a trade school) instead of exploring what it is you want to do.<p>I think this is fine, but I really believe that the best case for community college is that it&#x27;s a great place to explore different programs if, like me, you&#x27;re leaving high school with no idea what you want to do (as many people seem to do).",1421281137

I had a few more thoughts, but summarizing, I worry that this is a case of an 1) incidentally found, 2) benign, 3) asymptomatic, 4) slow or non-growing mass was removed despite the recommendations of multiple neurologists and after fishing for a neurosurgeon who was willing to cut it out.<p>The story starts with an accidental, incidental finding. The wife recently underwent thyroid surgery, and the husband pressures the wife to get an MRI of a different anatomical location when the patient feels well and did not have any symptoms. This mass is an incidentaloma — something found on a fishing expedition and not by looking for a particular cause to a problem. The problems with such an approach are well described in this old New York Times article, however the synopsis is such: When we look for problems with very precise tests, we can always find something to intervene upon and see something wrong. This is a problem well known in the statistics of screening tests in that even very good laboratory tests have significant harms when applied indiscriminately to everyone and everything. For people not in medicine, this can be analogous to not adjusting in frequentist statistics when one does multiple hypothesis testing and simply using one p-value of 0.05 to make decisions.<p>The article describes the management of a meningioma, of which the vast majority of cases are entirely non-malignant, either non-growing or slow growing, and asymptomatic (often only found on autopsy or incidental imaging). The wikipedia article on meningiomas says this:<p>In a retrospective study on 43 patients, 63% of patients were found to have no growth on follow-up, and the 37% found to have growth at an average of 4 mm / year.[23] … In another study, clinical outcomes were compared for 213 patients undergoing surgery vs. 351 patients under watchful observation.[24] Only 6% of the conservatively treated patients developed symptoms later, while among the surgically treated patients, 5.6% developed persistent morbid condition, and 9.4% developed surgery-related morbid condition.<p>The very fact that the article mentions the surgeon thought that a partial resection of the mass was a success suggests that there was little to no concern for malignancy. One does not try to take out only part of a malignant neoplasm (with the potential to grow significantly) without offering chemotherapy or radiation as adjunct therapy. In fact, I would rather argue that the husband’s big triumph was realizing that the two MRIs had shown the meningioma had little to no interval growth — and such a conclusion would recommend against rapid, aggressive surgery.<p>From all appearances, the article suggests the wife did not have any symptoms. She could have had the meningioma since birth — a harmless birthmark that was hidden until she underwent a superflous but expensive and highly sensitive imaging test. While it is true the meningioma is close to her eye, I would be surprised if a surgeon could intraoperatively tell the progression of the mass more than multiple MRI imaging studies. While it is true that there is always a small risk that a meningioma will grow, the slow progression on MRI suggests to me that symptoms would only slowly occur and there is a low likelihood that she would ever need emergent surgery. Finally, surgical resection causes inflammatory changes in the area which could exacerbate mass effects at the site and there is a high chance that it would come back (particularly with a partial resection).<p><a href=""https://medium.com/@davidouyang/providing-optimal-care-576ab231e121"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@davidouyang/providing-optimal-care-576ab...</a>",1421280521

For others, it&#x27;s typically later (biology). For startups, I bet it depends heavily on what the company is doing.

And the number of http calls (and their latency) also makes a difference in performance; SPAs tend to have smaller requests but larger numbers of them and it seems to me that&#x27;s actually the opposite profile of what 3/4G cellular networks are good at. (And while this is all less true on the desktop I&#x27;m starting to find it annoying that we&#x27;re nevertheless finding ways to make things choppy and slow on 2 GHz machines with operations not more complex than <i>scrolling</i>).<p>* This is more vague, but I find there&#x27;s a discipline imposed in starting the conception of the app in terms of plain HTML/HTTP that seems to keep things better organized, while projects that start with a focus on a rich/heavy UI devolve into overspecific yet mixed concerns more quickly.

If facebook were sticking to the web/mobile, their value as a company would be a bit limited, and there would always be the possibility that they will eventually be disrupted in the same way that they disrupted MySpace.<p>Zuckerberg yesterday was talking about building new computing platforms. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily increase the value of Facebook, but it takes away a lot of the caps that would otherwise exist on their future valuation.

Courses are designed to teach you how a language works in both theory and practice and they generally go through a language and help you understand what parts of it do and why it does what it does.<p>Nearly all modern languages have developed as some response to C, and Python is also studied because it has a good reputation as a first language.<p>Software development is about coordinating work so that it produces a product that is reliable and also on time and under budget. This is the sort of thing you can learn, somewhat, by examining the code and work done in open source, but mostly you learn it by working in a (good) software development office.

Everyone is photoshoping friend requests into 3D Farmville screenshots and it&#x27;s humorous and I get from a gamer perspective, but from other professionals in this industry I find it pretty shocking.  Notch is vocal in his opposition, but it really just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  It&#x27;s hardware and an SDK at the end of the day, and now it&#x27;s in the hands of a leading tech company this is vanguarding OTHER difficult problems of their existing industry (and open sourcing large parts of it!).<p>I have the DK1, and I ordered the DK2 not even a week ago, I&#x27;ve been active in tinkering with Oculus for a while now and even did some Twitch.tv casts of BF3, DayZ, etc. and other games running through TriDef or VorpX.  I&#x27;m about to start working on a project allowing MS Kinect usage to be broadcast in an Oculus compatible format for web consumption by Oculus users.  So I&#x27;m pretty &quot;in touch&quot; with the tech at this point.<p>I see this move as FB ensuring a healthy portfolio and healthy future stock price for their investors by getting the jump on patents and technology of a sure fire success emerging market.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have 3D oculus web cam video calls or friend requests popping up in your flight sim, that&#x27;s just rampant and misguided speculation.<p>If I had a choice about WHO bought Oculus the top of the list would be Valve. They already have Carmack, having Newell in the mix would be amazing and ensure the tech was in good hands.  Facebook or Google would be next in line, and waaaaay down at the bottom of the list would be Sony, Microsoft, or EA (I would burn the hardware and pretend it never existed if EA bought it).<p>tl;dr The entire community is acting like a bunch of idiots, stop it, you&#x27;re embarrassing yourselves and showing your business management ignorance.  If I was a company that made it big in the social boom and IPO&#x27;d but was facing a shrinking userbase on my life blood product, you better bet your ass I&#x27;d utilize my resources to diversify my business.  Keeping your all your eggs in a single basket is a historically bad idea.<p>edit: also based on these comments people think Oculus offers software... they don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t play an Oculus VR MMORPG... they provide hardware and an SDK, everything else is up to content producers, the scaling crisis would be purely one of hardware manufacturing and distribution and maintaining a very widely used SDK.  Which I would consider FB pretty okay at... I won&#x27;t say good... but okay will suffice, especially considering backwards compatibility for hardware/software of this type isn&#x27;t a big concern.",1395881498

7477803,comment,7473787,7474148,2,0,tomphoolery,,,"> The point is that generally people in management can be assumed to be doing their best.<p>This is a very significant point. The best part about building systems with computers is that their reactions to your changes are deterministic. With people, it isn&#x27;t so cut-and-dry, <i>especially</i> in the world of cutting big-money business deals. In my personal opinion, there&#x27;s really no &quot;right&quot; way to run a business, but there are plenty of wrong ways.<p>Over time, I&#x27;ve learned that one major origin of respect for your co-workers as well as your superiors stems from a respect or appreciation of them <i>as people</i>. Personally, I feel as though many of my co-workers could have been friends of mine had we met outside of work (not that they can&#x27;t be even though we met <i>at</i> work, but you get my point), and I&#x27;m confident that they both understand and respect my viewpoints, because I do the same for them. This means a lot to me. When I see something wrong, I say something. In a small team startup, I believe I have the power to make changes that could affect the outcome of the company. Not only that, but I believe the product that we&#x27;re developing is useful and beneficial to mass amounts of people. It may not be a venue by which we can &quot;change the world&quot;, but perhaps we can make a few people&#x27;s lives a little easier <i>and</i> bring their costs down tremendously.<p>So coming back, a lot of what this may be is a disconnect between the developer and the authority figures that sit atop him in the hierarchy. It&#x27;s always hard to bow down to authority, but one with power who you both trust and admire is not really considered an &quot;authority&quot; in your head, is it?<p>It could &quot;just be you&quot;, but I happen to think there are far more people out there I <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> want to work for than people I do want to work for.",1395881148

Usually about 2/3 the melting point of the ceramic; enough to promote ionic motion leading to fusing of the powder in a reasonable amount of time (one-two hours for my lab-sized samples).<p>Various techniques for lowering the sintering temperature are:<p>- Increase the sintering time. The time required to achieve a given density (say, 95%) increases somewhat rapidly as you decrease the temperature<p>- Add a glass to the ceramic powder. The glass melts and essentially lubricates things so there is sufficient motion at lower temperature.<p>- Start with finer ceramic powder. This has higher surface area for a given amount, which is an energetically unfavorable state (the fused state has lower surface energy and is thus more favorable).<p>- Apply pressure while sintering [3]<p>- Live with less density. Pottery needn&#x27;t be 95+% dense. Clay (or playdough) can be useful for some situations (not bullet-proof vest I imagine) if just let to air dry.<p>- Other clever things I don&#x27;t know about.<p>I know there are metallic substances that can survive sintering processes, as in multi-layer ceramic capacitors, where a sandwich of ceramic/electrode/ceramic/electrode is sintered, but these tend to be the expensive metals that don&#x27;t react with oxygen [1].<p>The polymer with the highest melting point I know of is Kapton [2], melting around 400 degC, which is quite a way from the 800 or so degC you might see after adding glass to your ceramic powder...<p>All that said, most ceramics are not that tough in that they shatter when impacted.

If people were applauding the acquisition, we would be reading an article on how the share price jumped 7%.<p>Fluctuations happen in the market every day tech stocks are particular delicate because it can be harder to predict what is going to happen. If you look around, you&#x27;ll notice Amazon dropped 3%, Twitter also dropped 7% (amongst a few others also down).<p>We don&#x27;t know for sure that the acquisition of Oculus even caused the drop. Although, looking back on previous FB acquisitions you see a drop of investor confidence as witnessed with the Whatsapp acquisition.<p>When Facebook announced the $19 billion purchase of Whatsapp their share price tumbled 4.8%, once again this was a short-lived drop once the fanfare died down. Facebook know what they are doing. The fact Sony are moving into the VR space and apparently Valve are also going to be getting in on it signals this isn&#x27;t a fad, this is a new-found technology arms race.<p>He who has the most money wins and at the moment, Facebook have a bit of money and a good network of investors behind them to propel Oculus to the top of the VR market and inevitably beat competitors on not only features but the all important price factor.<p><i></i>Edit<i></i>: I&#x27;ve been down-voted.

That is what a supervisor or lead is for. While managers are certainly responsible for nurturing and growing their teams efficiently, they&#x27;re also highly concerned with managerial duties to the company, which can often be unseen or misunderstood by their direct reports.<p>Managers often have responsibilities to the management team, the executive team, and other departments entirely. Take an IT department for example. All of the other departments in the company, including operations (where IT often sits to avoid conflict with engineering, and because largely it&#x27;s an operational focus), are its internal clients, and the management in IT must work with the management of all other departments.<p>Meanwhile, IT engineers (sysadmins, devops, etc) often under recognize that this intricate dance is going on. The executive team will put pressures on the department, and the manager must delicately balance their needs with what the needs of the team are as well.<p>Thus, the engineer often looks for a manager that focuses solely on the team. But long term, the manager ends up having to account for the needs of the company. Any manager will need to do this.<p>It&#x27;s ultimately important that the staff understands that their manager is superior to them simply because the position requires this of them (not necessarily because of any inherent skill advances). To look for an equal out of your manager is and will continue to be an exercise in futility.",1395880524

But there are pretty decent funds set aside specifically for small businesses, using funds that Congress has earmarked to the National Science Foundation exclusively for such a purpose. Last I saw, the success rate for applying for such funds (in terms of % of applications successfully funded) was actually higher than for academic applicants, though the total awards are smaller.<p>You do have to convince a funder that your independent research organization is serious and capable of delivering research. But if you can do so, in the U.S. there are two NSF programs specifically targeting research money towards small businesses. The first is the Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTP). This requires two organizations, with a small business and an academic institution submitting a joint proposal. They propose a plan for taking current academic results and turning them into viable products that will support a small business. The idea is to give money that will enable the academia-industry barrier to be crossed, with one partner on each side who explains why they are a good team for making the crossing happen. The second is the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which small business can apply solo to. This funds activities that take place wholly in the private sector, but present a credible research plan that the evaluators consider to have a high likelihood of producing scientifically interesting results.",1395879936

Boyd&#x27;s vision was of huge numbers of cheap lightweight fighters dominating the skies. They could shoot down anything, evade any threat. Combine them with the unmatched pilot instructor training offered at the FWS and the Air Force would be a truly awesome beast.<p>Other roles such as CAS could be handled by other planes like the A-10. Boyd&#x27;s critical insight was that you don&#x27;t want much flexibility in an aircraft. Make it supremely effective, and it would find a versatility on its own. Just as the superior training of the F-4 pilots (instructed by Boyd himself and his peers) allowed them to be effective despite inferior hardware. A master with an old, rusty sword will beat a novice with Excalibur every time. But give him a gun and he&#x27;s got a fighting chance.<p>> In other words, Boyd&#x27;s vision of where air combat was heading wasn&#x27;t really spot on.<p>I would say that air combat could have evolved the way Boyd had envisioned it, but didn&#x27;t because he was marginalized. Evolution doesn&#x27;t just happen, someone or something makes it happen. And then the results are looked at as inevitable, when they really aren&#x27;t. Boyd was probably ahead of his time when it comes to combined arms strategy.<p>Eventually the Russians or someone else will put his vision into action and mop the floor with their adversaries, proving him right.

But as far as the 2D business apps go, they run quite well.<p>Most business software is written for DOS, OS/2, and 16 bit Windows. None of the modern 64 bit systems will run it. DOSBOX can run most 16 bit DOS programs but lacks printer support and other things. With a virtual machine an IBM PC-DOS 2.0 for example it is possible to emulate a parallel port and redirect the printing using a DOS based Postscript driver so that the printing goes to a Postscript file and then using Ghostscript it can be printed on any modern printer.<p>I really don&#x27;t see why this subject is not discussed more on Hacker News. Many businesses are still running very old DOS, OS/2 and 16 bit Windows PCs because the modern systems break their critical business software. If those machines fail, there are no new ones to buy and replace them. So these 386 and 286 PC systems have become rare and worth a lot of money. But a Virtual Machine can run an old DOS, OS/2 or 16 bit Windows version to run the old business software on a modern PC using QEMU or VirtualBox or even VMWare.<p>I know people who want to do virtual machines for these businesses, but how does one start out doing that?

Klout, for the most part, had a very ambitious goal.<p>Given all our activity (direct or indirect) that is being captured on social networks and general internet activity, there was some inherent value (which we&#x27;ll call a &quot;clout score&quot;) in just knowing who was the &quot;most popular&quot; on these networks.<p>Now imagine you took in all the interest-graph related and search data, and refined that &quot;clout score&quot; to the niches and groups where that individual was most influential. In this hypothetical alternate universe, you can use clout scores and deduce, for example, that &quot;so-and-so&quot; was a more influential voice in the battery materials science community (i.e, cathodes) because her white papers were being shared more often on social networks and getting more backlinks.<p>But Klout didn&#x27;t do that. Klout realized that to get to market quickly, they applied an arbitrary algorithm to social activity, which would encourage artificial activity on Klout to &quot;game&quot; the system. In another different alternate universe, this would be applauded as a successful growth hack and Klout would be filing their S-1 today. But in our universe, people saw the algorithm as hackneyed, particularly when Justin Bieber had a higher Klout score than the US president.<p>This go-to-market strategy was likely (I&#x27;m presuming) influenced by VC investor dollars and the perceived need to be always growing, driven by TechCrunch mentions and HackerNews front page posts. And to some extent, they were successful. They raised a lot of venture dollars, cashed out a few early employees (again, presuming) and convinced some really smart people to join and grow Klout.<p>But now that they&#x27;ve sold out, they can never do what they wanted to do. And in some ways, they&#x27;ve tainted that idea for others who may appreciate the &quot;clout score.&quot; So selling out for $200M--for recurring revenue from large brands, patents associated with social activity scoring (didn&#x27;t fact-check this but guessing) and great employees--is not a bad outcome for Klout or for Lithium.<p>But I&#x27;m sure once upon a time, Joe Fernandez (the founder), had a grander vision.

In the analogous case in PFP, even if the continuation monad is the mother of all monads (and I haven&#x27;t finished reading that post you linked to), I&#x27;d have to imagine it wouldn&#x27;t be a whole lot of fun to use it exclusively.

Perhaps, I&#x27;m being biased. While I am all for people being happy in their marriages, I guess I&#x27;m pretty narrow minded to think that people in arranged marriages make their marriages work (culturally enforced or not). I don&#x27;t believe in perfect marriages; there are always going to be problems.<p>In the end, I feel it&#x27;s a healthier environment for the children out of the marriage. Love marraiges are a more natural, a more realistic option over the arranged marriages setup, but I think it also needs both people to be extremely mature, not greedy, and make proactive effots towards keeping the relationship stable. That is sadly something I can&#x27;t think of the people I see around, in the society we live. People are way too greedy, so it&#x27;s easier for them to abandon their partners and move to &#x27;greener pastures&#x27;.",1441601351

I sort of lucked into this position when the CTO left the company suddenly due to personal reasons. Rather than bringing in a new CTO right away, I convinced management to promote me to director to ease the transition. So far it&#x27;s been a year, and they haven&#x27;t even started the search for a CTO, since I handle most of those duties (though the time may come where we need someone with more experience as we grow and expand).<p>The most important skills for my position are being able to quickly spot talent (or lack thereof) in other engineers (necessary for quick hiring and firing), the ability to mentor and develop other engineers, especially when they are possibly more talented than I am, and the ability to communicate with the rest of the management team. This last one is the most important of the three listed. Part of that is giving good estimates for level of effort, time to market, expenses, etc.<p>Being in a leadership role, you have to be able to trust your team to get the coding work done so you can focus on bigger picture things like managing, architecture, etc. A good VP will not be coding most of the time.",1441599285

In other words, the government cannot force you to have certain beliefs, or silence you, or throw you in jail arbitrarily. I say this thinking of the US Constitution, which was written in a time when kings actually did many of these things.<p>Applied to modern times, the police first have an obligation to not attack you for your beliefs. That doesn&#x27;t make them your slaves. After that, they&#x27;ll defend your beliefs if there&#x27;s a law forcing them to (which is a positive law).",1377071956

I suppose all this boils down to is whether you want your science science-y or feel-y. I prefer the science science.

I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s impossible to make scientific discoveries this way. The problem is that any discovery you make is N=1 and as far away from a double-blind trial as it can be.

I would guess the author of the author of the article meant ci&quot; (change the text inside double quotes), which is vim-specific rather than vi (even a recent vim version, not an old one). ViEmu also supports that, but I&#x27;d guess many other emulators won&#x27;t.<p>Indeed supporting a large part of the vim commands most people use is no walk in the park.

What happens when the working class rises and takes what&#x27;s theirs is that after some time, a new elite emerges thanks to this working class, pretending to have the same values, while actually screwing this very same class even more.<p>The crucial distinction to make here is what&#x27;s yours and what&#x27;s not. If people agree that one billionaire made his money honestly, by creating companies where people work voluntarily and that provide products and services people really need, thus actually creating value - then there can be no justification for anyone to go and take part or all of this billionaire&#x27;s money. If they agree he stole his money or extracted them by force, then he&#x27;s a criminal and all of the money he made in this way should be confiscated. But there&#x27;s no middle ground here. You can&#x27;t make a person kinda-guilty because he&#x27;s rich.<p>But back to &quot;might makes right&quot;. The collective might of the people is always greater than the might of any organization, be it government or a corporation. If people understood the distinction of two ways to get rich I described above, they could easily support protection agencies that would prosecute criminals, but leave alone and protect rich people who made their money honestly. This kind of arrangement would promote a greater degree of equality. And we&#x27;ve seen this historically too: the great rises in standards of living for the poor happened where markets flourished and regulations were minimal (scandinavian countries including, read their policies throughout the 20th century). Yes, rich people became richer. But so did the poor.",1377068921

It's very simple, but it's a bit of puzzle. Some of you might see immediately what is happening, others might not be able to ever figure it out. I don't mind either way, but I'm trying to get some data before doing a thorough experiment.<p>I put it on Hacker News because it really is a puzzle, and most of my hackerish friends liked playing it (though some got frustrated). I hope you like it too!",1242039167

603269,comment,603148,603247,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"That's true.  I suspect oil has made dramatically more millionaires and billionaires than software has (but, having lived for many years in Texas, having a dad that worked as an engineer in the oil and gas industry, and then working myself for a few years on software for the oil and gas industry, my view of rich people and how they got that way may be skewed).  But, I think maybe we're past the time when there are major opportunities for new people to make their fortune in oil.  Though I do know some software developers who're rich because of the software they make for the oil and gas industry.<p>Anyway, I don't know, either.  We're all working with dramatically less data than we need to make an informed decision.<p>But, since we're probably all strongest at technical stuff, rather than finance or arbitrage or whatever other ways folks make a billion dollars, I kinda think our best odds are in playing to our strengths.",1242038790

603261,comment,603036,603152,0,0,jacobolus,,,"> <i>A person in the middle ages wouldn't be surrounded by a toxic environment</i><p>Are you serious? You don't think living in a tiny room with 10 family members and all kinds of animals (along with all of the lice, fleas, diseases, etc. that go along), with a wood fire filling the whole place with eye-stinging, lung-choking smoke, was a ""toxic environment""?  You'd be eating mostly grains, with very occasionally some meat, and if it spoiled you'd still figure out some way to eat it, because otherwise you'd be going hungry altogether (and that would happen anyway, in poor harvest years). The water would be whatever you had nearby, probably infected with all kinds of pathogens from the excrement that would inevitably wind up there. You'd maybe have a sweat bath or sponge bath once every week or two if you were lucky, using the same water for the whole family. You certainly wouldn't have more than a few changes of clothes, which you'd wear for days or weeks at a time.<p>I suggest you spend some time with rural peasants in a developing country before arguing about toxic environments or nutrient-deprived food.",1242038137

So if you did get sent back to the middle ages, the diseases would be much less likely to kill you as you are generally much more robust as a result of your late 20th century upbringing, and you'd be less likely to get them as you would understand how they spread e.g. avoiding drinking water with human excrement in it. And of you course you didn't die in childbirth or shortly after, by conveniently being in a different century, which will put you above average in life span too.<p>And the big message from the book: avoid the doctors. They would actively be weakening you via bleeding, laxatives and emetics, right up until about the 1920s.",1242037318

I cant imagine anyone seriously suggesting PCA on a half a million by half a million matrix, or evaluating this matrix in the first place.<p>This actually a fairly actively researched topic: whether edit distance can be embedded, even if approximately in a vector space. It has been surprisingly resistant to such efforts. Yes there are some results but nothing very satisfactory.<p>Edit distance is a metric, so it was believed it would easy to map individual strings to vectors, such that the distance between two vectors was same as, or close to the edit distance between the corresponding strings. What we want, then, is an (approximate) isomorphism between these two metric spaces. In addition, in the interest of size we would like these vectors to be of small dimension. If the required dimension is high it would defeat the purpose if the string to vector map needs to be stored. Unfortunately it seems edit distance is resistant to isomorphism to a low-dimensional vector space. There is also this question which metric do we use in the vector space, Euclidean, Manhattan...? there are some results on the L1, i.e. embedding on a vector space with Manhattan distances.<p>Fun story: was an intern in Google&#x27;s spelling correction team once upon a time long ago. So I was explaining what I was doing, the person I was explaining it to was thoroughly unimpressed: &quot;So whats the big deal, you know/hear the word and write down the spelling&quot;. It made me realize how difficult spelling in English is compared to some of the other languages. The variability in the map from phonemes to spelling is quite high in English. This person was Italian, he told me Italian has a lot less variability in this regard.",1407639550

With every extraordinary claim someone makes it can take actual science a few minutes to explain (this is why extraordinary claims should always come with extraordinary evidence otherwise you&#x27;re just wasting everyone&#x27;s time like this article). Pseudo science is incredibly easy to generate; you just find something that makes easy correlations (regardless of their validity) and fits within a narrative people love and you&#x27;re done. Science then has to go through each item and explain why each one is wrong.<p>I shouldn&#x27;t have to go through articles like this and look up and source each piece that&#x27;s incorrect; if readers simply apply some critical thinking and do a little investigation on their own (and, hey, actually READ a REAL study once in a while so you can see what a good study and a bad study looks like) they can see right through it.<p>I don&#x27;t have much experience with HN and pseudo science articles; because this crowd is usually really smart I kinda assumed it would have been really easy to tell this was bullshit.",1407639524

I don&#x27;t think you do.<p>Hard sciences like physics and chemistry are able to describe processes in minute detail because the systems being studied are relatively simple. As you scale the systems up, the level of detail that science produces is diminished, because there&#x27;s a higher level of uncontrolled variables. This is why people make the difference between hard science and soft science, you can still try to follow scientific principles without getting a high level of conclusivity.<p>What soft sciences rely on is a body of observational evidence. Here&#x27;s a classic example from the article...\n&quot;For decades, chlorpyrifos, marketed by Dow Chemical beginning in 1965, was the most widely used insect killer in American homes. Then, in 1995, Dow was fined $732,000 by the EPA for concealing more than 200 reports of poisoning related to chlorpyrifos. It paid the fine and, in 2000, withdrew chlorpyrifos from household products. Today, chlorpyrifos is classified as “very highly toxic” to birds and freshwater fish, and “moderately toxic” to mammals, but it is still used widely in agriculture on food and non-food crops, in greenhouses and plant nurseries, on wood products and golf courses.&quot;",1407638571

8158668,comment,8156786,8158463,2,0,jwecker,,,"Point taken, and I acknowledged in my first comment that it was a weak reason compared to the reasons for adopting. It wasn&#x27;t meant as advocacy :-)<p>I would point out however that no one (that I know of) claims that English is the most popular because it is intrinsically the most efficient for all situations- i.e., on its merits as an efficient language rather than geopolitical factors. I definitely think that there are certain situations where communicating using non-English would be (locally) optimal- even if the parties communicating were fluent in English. Even as a native English speaker I truly wish English had the equivalent of the Tagalog particle &quot;daw/raw,&quot; for example ( <a href=""http://tagaloglang.com/Tagalog-English-Dictionary/English-Translation-of-Tagalog-Word/daw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tagaloglang.com/Tagalog-English-Dictionary/English-Tr...</a> ), or the fact that Cantonese can often communicate the same information as English using far fewer syllables...<p>In other words, I&#x27;m perfectly fine saying that using English is globally optimal (and convenient for me) because of its adoption, while still being perfectly happy knowing that some languages have attributes that make them more efficient, if you know them, in certain circumstances. I don&#x27;t pretend ex-facto that English got this way because it is a truly superior solution in all circumstances if only everyone knew it. Nor do I feel like English&#x27;s status as a (quasi)-standard is threatened by someone pointing out that Swedish would be more efficient in some settings (say, family history) even if everyone did know English. I would say &quot;cool.&quot;<p>Defining units in terms of other units via something other than base-10 scaling in order to have more integer factors than 2 and 5- in some cases trading the 5 for 3 and 4- can be advantageous.

If two people need an all day plumbing job done today, and there&#x27;s only one plumber in time, one of them is not going to get it done, regardless of how much they pay.<p>So when we look industry-wide, what the salary increases do is make people change professions.

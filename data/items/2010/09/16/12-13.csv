1697646,comment,1697526,1697526,0,0,bobds,,,"I don't like the arbitrary minimum rate but I do see how it would differentiate you from the rest of freelancing marketplaces. I think it would be better to have different minimums depending on category and type of work. There is no reason why data entry or similar should start at $35/hr, It just shouldn't be $3/hr. Could also have different minimums for different countries, freelancers have different standards on what's a good hourly rate, many of them can do fine with $20/hr.<p>Other pain points to address:<p>It's very tiring having to bid on dozens of projects and never getting any work. This is a major problem for new freelancers. You have to lowball dozens of bids in hopes of getting your first ratings.<p>Something like Odesk's tests for freelancers but higher quality.<p>Buyers should also be reviewed not just freelancers. Putting money into escrow before accepting a bid should be mandatory, at least for new buyers.<p>I've used about five different freelancing websites in the past but it's been a while since then and I think a lot of problems are not coming to mind now. I'll let you know if I think of more pain points I would like to see addressed.<p>EDIT:\nI tried signing up but my current address is not in a country listed in your dropdown menu.

1697643,comment,1696897,1696897,0,0,acdha,,,"A great example of begging the question. The basic assumption is that Google's UIs are unpopular without any evidence that this is true; given the wide popularity among the people I know (even the designers) I think it'd be more accurate to say that Google is successfully producing clean, functional designs and not even attempting web design contest entries.<p>UI is more than looking pretty - gmail is popular because it stays out of the way and lets you focus on content, which it handles quite well; in contrast, iTunes increasingly feels like a train-wreck because they swap icons without fixing any of the quirky behaviours and non-standard interface conventions which users must memorize. It was also a confusing comparison because a UI for managing a tightly-curated, highly-structured list containing on average a few thousand items pre-selected by the user isn't obviously relevant to arbitrarily searching across billions of unknown items.",1284641583
1697642,comment,1696945,1696945,0,0,jakevoytko,,,"Reddit kicked Digg's ass because Reddit is designed as a feedback loop that benefits all users. Digg only rewards elite users.<p>Look at a random Reddit submission. If it survives the first minute, it makes some user's frontpage. If it is ""good,"" it gets votes and is seen by more people. If the username is popular, it gets upvoted faster. But it turns out this is not necessary for success - I have submitted successful articles without any possible benefit of name recognition, or help from friends.<p>Reddit's comment section is a great feedback loop: Reddit is designed for discussion, and discussion is great at generating more discussion. Large comment threads form on popular articles, even if they're only lightly inspired by the article or vapid. You must check your recent comments to defend yourself, since the risk is high that someone will strongly and persuasively disagree with you. After all, it's Reddit. Good comments get trophies. Really good comments make /r/bestof.<p>In contrast, Digg is a feedback loop that benefits the best users. Within a few years of Digg's launch (especially after they dropped the technology-only focus), it was almost impossible to get an article on the frontpage without a friend network, or the blessing of a poweruser. The various sections of Digg were littered with hundreds of high-quality articles with two Diggs. To successfully submit articles to Digg, you needed to focus energy on gaining a network and voting on articles that they submit, and using this network to gain a larger network. The last time I was there, the comments section was also a nightmare. It is designed for single-use comments, and not for discussion. At one point they introduced nested comments, but it seems like they've either done away with it, or don't have enough comments to nest.<p>The best website designs act as feedback loops. Reddit has polished theirs.",1284641528

Cross platform isn't an issue - Windows has equivalents for every single thing on your list, whether native or something they already ship like Apple Software Update.<p>As far as package management goes, the problem here is that Apple simply does not care. The Mac sysadmin community has been asking for better solutions for years but it's just not a priority for Apple - even App Store updates, which theoretically are more important, have been broken[1] for something like the last 4 major iTunes releases but since it's merely clumsy and doesn't prevent sales it obviously hasn't been as important as a new version of some non-standard window controls.<p>[1] The process is now: click on Apps.

1697586,comment,1695911,1697337,0,0,jashkenas,,,"Leaving features off the table and just talking about semantic cleanups, here's a few:<p>* Switch statement doesn't fall-through by default.<p>* Variables don't need to be declared with ""var"", and can't ever become global accidentally.<p>* Equality is strict, using `===`, if you want coercive equality, you coerce the object yourself.<p>* Loops that are used to generate functions close over their index variables, so that all inner functions don't share the final value of the index. This is the same problem that ECMAScript Harmony introduces ""let"" to solve.<p>* Splats largely replace use of the ""arguments"" object, so you don't get bit by ""arguments"" only being a faux-array.<p>* Comparisons can be chained, as in Python -- so you can write: ""100 > x > 25"", and have the answer be correct.<p>* Multiline strings are valid without having to escape the newline.<p>* And the big one: everything in CoffeeScript is an expression. Without having to use temporary variables, you can return the result of an if/else from a function, pass a comprehension (loop) directly into a function call, assign the result of a try/catch, and so on.<p>I love JavaScript semantics as well. I think it has the cleanest object/function model out there, in terms of scripting languages -- but that's not to say there aren't parts that can use a little touch-up.",1284640246

1697584,comment,1697441,1697441,0,0,elblanco,,,"> Apple mice seem to be the canary in the coal mine.  If Apple starts designing mice we all want to use - it is a sign their engineering practices have turned upside down and their products will not have the same minimalistic qualities that make them incredibly popular.<p>Apple mice suck. Period. They're practically unusable, poorly tested, unreliable, overly expensive garbage. Problems with their pointer devices are noticeable to anybody withing the first 5 minutes of using the device. To make matters worse, the way mouse inputs are handled is similarly bad. Unusable and unpredictable acceleration curve with no exposed configuration to tune it, and decades of trying everything possible to avoid having a second button has created all kinds of nonstandard ways of handling right mouse clicks and all kinds of legacy keyboard gyrations for simple actions that could just be handled through a right-click context menu. Option-Shift-Command-Delete really, so I'm modifying a modification or a modifier key? Wow, that's totally discoverable. The semantics of such a command astound. (it's slowly improving, but right-click context menus are not really in the Apple culture).<p>It's bizarre because Apple is really the first company to design their devices around non-keyboard input, even going to far as to remove arrow keys off of the keyboard in early devices to force people to use the mouse, their touch devices have reinvented mobile computing, and their interface standards are extremely high, why is it then that the mouse I had with my original single body black and white Macintosh is more usable than anything the company has produced since the ridiculous hockey puck mouse in the 90s? Does nobody in the company actually use their products? Is everybody just walking around with MBPs using the trackpads?<p>One lesson to be learned though is that there simply is a certain amount of complexity you have to deal with in modern computing. You can shift that complexity around (eliminate the right mouse button, but then you have to have awkward and non-discoverable four key combinations), but it's very hard to eliminate it. Trying to find the optimal balance point that allows the best possible management of this complexity is <i>hard</i>.",1284640057

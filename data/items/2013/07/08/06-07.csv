For example, hugging is a spontaneous gesture (aside from greeting/farewell hugs) meant to convey a feeling of connectedness between two people.  It sounds like you are actually suffering from feelings of alienation and in your confusion, projecting these feelings onto society and the YC/HN community at large.  Furthermore, increase in the use of prescription antidepressants is only a correlation between time and prescription antidepressant use.  That is to say, it doesn&#x27;t prove that people are more depressed nowadays.",1373266742

Pathfinding is part of AI, which, like physics, is part of the &quot;business rules&quot; side of the game, and therefore should be running at a constant rate, which has to be tuned to not eat too much CPU time on slower computers and defines the minimum specs for running the game.<p>If you don&#x27;t care if everyone&#x27;s opponents are equally smart, you can always glance at the clock each time through the loop/level of recursion and cut off the pathfinding if it&#x27;s taking too long. If you&#x27;re planning all of the routes through a map (at least on a macro scale - hierarchical, highway-like pathfinding saves a lot of time if you can stand the occasional quirks of its behavior) at runtime, you might be able to set up a system that steals a few cycles whenever there&#x27;s time left over while the previous area is being played and then only blocks if it still isn&#x27;t done when needed. But at that point, why not compute those paths <i>really</i> ahead of time (at map build) and then load them in as part of a map file?",1373266541

And I think that this split between capital control and ownership of capital is one of the most important theoretical difficulties in applying Marxist analysis to 21st century finance capitalism.

The issue was that a few dozen avatars in a simulation combined with dozens of simulations on a server would lead to thousands of threads each causing memory swaps, with the need for locking to avoid race conditions and other contention issues.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a real-time interface, so a second plus or minus to responses wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.

6005387,comment,6002596,6003779,5,0,qnrq,,,"Hi,<p>I&#x27;m glad I found your comment, I just pushed something like what you just described to one of my repos yesterday. Hear me out, I&#x27;m not self promoting myself out of context here.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on an OpenPGP integration for the Roundcube webmail project and have so far added functionality from the OpenPGP.js library. The pros of this is of course usability and that no external applications are necessary, the cons are, amongst others, what you just wrote above.<p>To be able to support briding local GPG binaries and keyrings into graphical browsers without exposing any critical information I threw together an HTTPD which listens on the client&#x27;s localhost. The concept is already proven to work, now it&#x27;s a mere matter of implementation. It&#x27;s based on the PyGPG library which wraps GPG into Python and is compatible with both Windows and *NIX systems as long as they can execute GPG and Python (which they can).<p>It&#x27;s still a work in progress but currently supports key generation and key listing in response to HTTP requests. Through cross-origin resource sharing users can specify which domains should be allowed to speak to it in a simple text file separated by line breaks.<p>I wrote up more detailed info on the approach and usage here: <a href=""https://github.com/qnrq/rc_openpgpjs/issues/64#issuecomment-20568610"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/qnrq/rc_openpgpjs/issues/64#issuecomment-...</a>\nSource code currently available here, although it will be separated to its own repository later: <a href=""https://github.com/qnrq/rc_openpgpjs/blob/pygpghttpd/pygpghttpd/pygpghttpd.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/qnrq/rc_openpgpjs/blob/pygpghttpd/pygpght...</a><p>I can conclude that what you are requesting is actively being built and partially already exists but still needs to be put to use. Hope you don&#x27;t view this as shameless advertising, because it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m only responding because your ideas are spot on what I pushed yesterday.<p>Any form of feedback is greatly appreciated.<p>Much love!",1373263495

6001317,comment,6001014,6001217,7,0,hamburglar,,,"There is no such thing as the free market when it comes to healthcare.  Not only is the consumer not in a position to shop around when dealing with health issues, partly because you&#x27;re often not in a position of even knowing what treatment you need until you&#x27;ve decided on a provider and undergone expensive consultations, but also, providers are put in positions of not being allowed to refuse service based on ability to pay.<p>Not to mention, the &quot;free market&quot; solution doesn&#x27;t actually involve consumers &quot;voting with their wallets&quot; and choosing the healthcare they want, but rather choosing from a very limited set of insurance options where they have no real choice or power.  And the choices they are offered basically amount to a small array of socialized healthcare options: you have no control over your benefits and extremely little ability to choose a different one, but everyone pays into a large pool and costs are shared by the group as a whole so outlier costs are not overly burdensome to individuals.  It is wholly baffling to me that anyone can support this system but be against socialized healthcare.  Our model <i>is</i> socialized healthcare, but instead of being socialized across the nation as a whole, it&#x27;s socialized across a particular employer or purchasing group.  Does this actually give us choice?  No.  Go analyze your health plan &quot;options&quot; offered by your employer and tell me you&#x27;re participating in the free market and I will laugh in your face.",1373180260

6001313,comment,6001014,6001289,6,0,zanny,,,"My Uncle is a doctor, went the full 9 years at Tulane and everything. He had to close his own practice because Medicare paid dirt, insurers would delay payments for years, and malpractice insurance was thousands a month. He was running around a 2,000 a month deficit when he had to fire his secretary and close down. He now works in a general hospital as a surgeon, and is actually happier not having to try to haggle getting paid or getting people to pay more.<p>Some doctors may be profiting off this, but the principle beneficiary is private insurance companies, at least from my experiences.

Unless, of course, you want to consider:<p>1) The stifling HIPAA regime that makes it almost impossible for small, potentially competitive practices to stay open without insane amounts of overhead, explaining their sellouts to larger at-scale healthcare corporations\n2) The necessity to offset insanely low negotiated and subsidized Medicare/Medicaid rates with bills on the uninsured, thus bifurcating healthcare recipients into &quot;pays too little&quot; and &quot;pays too much&quot; categories with no in-between\n3) The employer-provided insurance scheme--another government-subsidized program--which hides prices from consumers and incentivizes providers to hike up prices\n4) Let&#x27;s not forget about the inability for insurance companies to hedge risk and lower costs by selling insurance across state lines\n5) Obamacare destroying any potentially new avenues for innovation by forcing the uninsured to buy into a broken system<p>What would happen if a doctor or hospital today started practicing medicine at affordable prices, competitively?

WHY on earth would you find this useless?!<p>Agree, you wouldn&#x27;t need it if you just had the ability to select a &quot;don&#x27;t combine taskbar buttons&quot; option (last time I checked Unity didn&#x27;t have this) -  the first option that I select on Windows 7/8. To me different windows of the same application are technically &quot;different apps/task&quot; and I want them to show separately on the taskbar or at least have an easy way of switching between them. The whole &quot;task based interface&quot; current is the biggest UI/X fail in recent history imho, and a misnomer on top of it - applications aren&#x27;t task, if I have two different web apps in two different windows (or simply two different sets of task specific tabs), they are two completely different tasks to me, I don&#x27;t want them grouped by application goddamit!<p>Even philosophically, in the &quot;UNIX way&quot; tasks emerge when one combines the use of a number of small applications to get a particular task done, while in the &quot;Mac/Windows way&quot; of &quot;big feature-full applications&quot; an application can be used to work on multiple task simultaneously in different windows. 1 to 1 mapping of apps to tasks and the &quot;combine windows on taskbar&quot; philosophy only apply to <i>very naive and inexperienced users</i> that don&#x27;t understand even 10% of the potential of the &quot;tool&quot; sitting in front of them, and they should not be catered for, they should be pushed and stressed to learn more whether they like it or not, because they <i>can</i> learn more, and they will inevitably get better at whatever they do by learning more - even Microsoft gets this (they know that if you are forced to learn more about their products and by learning more about them you become more productive with them, you will grow more dependent on them, whereas if something is &quot;very easy&quot; but limited, you&#x27;ll be able to switch to a competing product that could give you even a minor increase in productivity at any time), even if would be suicide for them to admit it and put it in any marketing material since they market themselves as &quot;easiest to use&quot; :)<p>...overall, I feel like Unity simply cherry picked the worst features from Windows 7 and Mac OS GUIs. At least the Windows GUI can be very easily customized in all relevant aspects and allows me to be very productive with it, while the Mac OS one is well polished and tested and after I get used to it has a nice &quot;flow&quot;.

Also I couldn&#x27;t touch type - I never learnt to type properly with Qwerty; I just started typing when I was young and developed lots of bad habits. By the time someone tried to teach me how to type properly my habits were too ingrained  to change. (Or maybe I was too stubborn -- I also have a strange way of holding a pen.)<p>Anyway, I decided to change to Colemak, and to learn to touch type properly. I also liked the idea of a columnar layout so I changed to a Kinesis. What&#x27;s interesting is that because of the physically different keyboards, I actually cannot type in Qwerty on my Kinesis, and I also cannot type in Colemak on my laptop keyboard. This means I have maintained my Qwerty skills.<p>My current maximum speed is roughly 70 wpm in Colemak, so I am almost at my Qwerty speed after 6 months, although now I can touch type so it&#x27;s more useful. When I type with Qwerty now, it feels like my hands are flying all over the place. I also feel like I have a lot of room to get faster than I currently am with Colemak.<p>So even though I have maintained my Qwerty skills, the only reason I need them is because I can&#x27;t get a laptop with a columnar keyboard. I may end up just biting the bullet and switching to Colemak on that laptop keyboard anyway, though missing the thumb cluster is killer.<p>One other interesting thing I learnt is that using Colemak on a smartphone completely sucks. Having commonly used keys on the home row on a small touchscreen means that it&#x27;s much more error prone, as you&#x27;re hitting the same area on the screen consecutively.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm</a>",1373177088

An attacker would just need to join the cloud and record IP addresses of peers they download from.

In fact, compared to cities in India, a few things might even be cheaper. But not medicine. An eye doctor&#x27;s visit costs $180, for Pink eyes!

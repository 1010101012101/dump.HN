Not only that, but they were, perhaps, the last computers ever built you could tell what they were doing just by looking at them.<p>I would love to see something like that on a desktop PC. Maybe not tasks or threads (and, certainly, not processors) or memory blocks being accessed and translating the patterns into blinking lights.",1210996405

The Amiga 500 memories come flooding back.<p>I guess Linux is stored in re-writable nonvolatile memory so that it can be updated when the inevitable security bugs are found.<p>If I remember correctly, on the Amiga, you had to boot from floppy disk (not everything was in ROM), and the ROM code was transferred from ROM to RAM and any patches on the floppy disk were then applied.",1210994557

I can also get a file browser of a directory by typing ""mate <i>directoryname</i>"" or just ""mate ."", then open multiple files in tabs.<p>Syntax highlighting is excellent, and themeable. All the common languages are built in, and you can get bundles for nearly any other language. Bundles include a hell of a lot more than just syntax highlighting too.<p>You can set up shortcuts for snippets of code and templates, like typing ""html"" then <tab> could give you a standard skeleton of an HTML document, and other more powerful macros.<p>You can easily pipe any text through any command line program you want. Need to sort a list of stuff? Just filter it through ""sort"". Need the current date? Just run ""date"" and TextMate inserts the result. Or any other arbitrarily complex command.<p>Of course, emacs, vi, etc probably have many of these features, but lack the integration with OS X. And I simply don't have the time/patience to learn them.<p>Oh, and the only SubEthaEdit feature besides collaborative editing that I miss in TextMate is the ability to copy an XHTML representation of syntax highlighted code. Very handy for blog posts, etc. And the multiple regex implementations in find.",1210994517

Then I went to an insurance company and people just didn't get the jokes :)<p>Naturally, I still told people my true thoughts and if you know how to justify your arguments <i>and</i> have the technical capability to back them up with action you will be absolutely indispensable.

But equating a CS degree with coding is just plain wrong; Dijkstra has a nice quote on this. CS is and should be applied mathematics, and what more timeless topic is there than math?<p>Secondly, there are some serious doubts whether university teaches you to think independently. As a counter argument, read ""The Disadvantage of an Elite Education""[1]. Summary of this article: university teaches you--if you're somewhat ambitious--to become an excellent sheep. In other words, it promotes you into being the same mediocre person as anyone else.<p>That said, I still believe there's a ton of things to be gained from spending four years in a university: network, culture, more-than-average-but-still-pretty-mediocre ability to think, fun, and being inside a solid recruitment base for cool companies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-el...</a>",1275263923

If you're self admittedly not good at the business/management end, I'd encourage you to think about what your real goal is. That is--I often find myself building products because--well--I love to build products. It's my hobby.<p>On the other hand, I've been involved with enough startups to know that most of my attempts to commercialize my products will probably fail. So back to goals--you say yours is to escape your cube. Do you mean:<p>1. I want to escape the type of job that puts me in a cube.<p>2. I want to no longer work as a developer.<p>3. I want to no longer work--since I'm filthy rich.<p>Those span the gamut of goals and without knowing what you are really after, it's hard to give you advice on how to proceed. For the sake of adding some direct reply, let's assume it's #1 above. In that case, I'd say--keep honing your skills, demo your product and use it as a calling card for a job search with companies you think you'd be a fit with (maybe even Square). Don't bother the commercialization path and don't sweat the competition--since this is lateral to your goal of a better workplace--and a lot more achievable than a commercially successful startup.<p>Hope that helps.",1275261274

The bolding is just a mechanism by which to achieve that experience, a communication tool similar to speed lines in a comic book. If a particular comic book does something other than speed lines to indicate movement—or if a particular website does something else to indicate emphasis—then that is what will be sought out, as that is the word used in the ""vocabulary"" of the site's design to describe emphasis.<p>Strength or emphasis are the real goals; people just aren't used to stating their real goals, rather than ""what they're trying to do.""

There's a difference, though both are served over ice.<p>Cold-press is actually brewed cold, and it takes hours to have a well-brewed batch.

It's hot brewed coffee refrigerated and/or poured over ice. This messes with the composition of the liquid, and generally causes it to become bitter.

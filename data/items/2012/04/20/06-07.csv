In return Microsoft had to make their compiler and their VM be compliant with Java's specifications.<p>Microsoft then started to extend everything, the language, the base class library (and you cannot extend the base namespaces, e.g. java.*) and their virtual machine. They did this while advertising to developers that their compiler takes Java code and produces Java-compatible bytecode.<p>The differences:<p><pre><code>     - Google never agreed to an (explicit) license\n     - Dalvik is not a Java VM and was never advertised as such\n     - Google does not claim Android has Java technology inside\n     - Google does not claim that the compiled binaries can be\n       executed on Java VMs\n</code></pre>\nWhat Google actually did:<p><pre><code>     - created a compiler that translates from JVM bytecode \n       to Dalvik bytecode\n     - took the base Java library from Harmony, a \n       clean-room implementation\n</code></pre>\nWhat Google did is exactly what projects like IKVM.net are doing. IKVM is a project that allows you to recompile and run Java jars on top of a .NET VM.<p>This is not new and if Oracle wins it will open a huge can of worms, as if our industry wasn't having enough problems related to ""intellectual property"" already.",1334904907

Or, 'are we in a multinationals bubble?'. The point is that we tend to group things together in categories. But does it make sense to put, say, Facebook and, say, MakeLeaps (start up that manages invoices for small businesses) in the same category? It think it does not, as much as it does not make sense to put Apple and Mc Donald in the same pot.

That would put their profits to ~$8B.<p>Now again assume that FB maintains its dominance successfully on all of the above 1+3 businesses for next 10 years. So in this ""dominating life span"" of FB, there would be total $80B made. If you put probability of everything from inventing new businesses to fending off all competitors successfully for next 10 years at 0.5 then FB's risk adjusted worth would be $40B. It should be obvious that this valuation is way too on generous side (normally I would more aggressive parameters). It should be easy to see that valuations like $100B is extremely unrealistic.<p>As OP has pointed out bubble is an effect when people take one unrealistic valuation as a reference point and make their own valuations just as unrealistic causing system-wide chain reaction.

It's the cultural norms of a <i>community</i> like HN, combined with its also socially-mediated ranking mechanism, that enable aggregators to function so well as content filters.

A couple is usually diagnosed as infertile after one year of frequent, unprotected, sexual intercourse.<p>When you decide to seek treatment to improve fertility or to overcome infertility, making sure that you choose a good fertility clinic is very important. One of the most common procedures performed at these clinics is in vitro fertilization, also called IVF for short.<p>This is a procedure that combines sperm and eggs in a dish in a laboratory to form embryos. A select number of the embryos are then transferred to the uterus where they may implant and develop into a fetus. If successful, the woman will become pregnant and will go through her pregnancy just as any other woman who conceived naturally.<p>Today IVF or invitro fertilization is slowly emerging as one of the preferred answers to issues like infertility and cases of miscarriage and failure in conceiving. IVF clinics are mushrooming in most cities of the world claiming to provide top class treatment and sure shot result. However, it is absolutely imperative to understand the various features that are integral to good IVF clinics.<p>Choosing a fertility clinic is an important decision, and there are many factors that come into play. After researching fertility clinics success rates and treatment offerings, you may want to supplement your knowledge by asking the fertility clinic some questions.<p>IVF clinics must have the following facilities.The clinic should also be able to contact special labs which have testing capabilities of such immunological obstruction. The clinic should enjoy the services of an Embryologist who should at least have a doctorate in chemical, biological or physical science. The person should have earlier performed at least 100 IVF procedures in a year. At least one person in the department must have expertise in fields like andrology, pre-implantation, pre and post fertilization and embryology.<p>So, IVF clinics must be the ones, which, not only assures you of efficiency but it does gets shown in the action as well.\nMost common facilities offered by IVF clinics worldwide include:<p>ART\nIVF\nIUI\nICSI\nSperm retrieval\nLaser assisted hatching\nSperm bank\nFreezing of embryo/oocyte/sperm\nDonation of sperm/egg/embryo\nSurrogacy and surrogates<p>Other services of IVF clinics include psychological counseling and also a rigorous process of screening when donors are involved.<p>Other factors that determine the choice a particular IVF clinic include factors like distance from home, the cost, the kind of counseling that is offered, the recommendations made by a certified doctor, the presence of a patient support group, the areas of specialization of the clinic, the rate of success achieved by the clinic, the kind of advertising that the clinic indulges in and reports and reviews by earlier patients or of friends and relatives who might know of the clinic.<p>Usually, doctors and specialists related to in vitro fertilization, IUI, or ICSI plan out the treatment in accordance with the medical reports of the tests conducted of an individual. Every individual has different sets of situation and disorders so is the treatment devised for them.<p>Keep in mind that clinic which has higher IVF cost is the only one catering quality treatment; instead clinic which is well organized and has expert doctors and medical facilities is the better one.<p>The key to ensuring that the IVF treatment process is relatively hassle-free is to choose the right clinic, one that lays down protocols and guidelines, advises Dr.Gautam Allahbadia,Is IVf ,surrogacy specialist and the Director of Rotunda -The Center for Human Reproduction, the world-renowned infertility clinic at Mumbai, India.<p>Parenthood is a life changing and eternally rewarding experience and Many have chosen IVF as a successful way to bring a child into their lives.<p>We will be happy to provide a second opinion on your conceiving a fertility problem.

(also, ec2 has an awesome reputation and can get corporate customers... so they are going to price themselves rather higher than the cost of production for that reason alone.  I should be cheaper than they are.)<p>Oh yeah, I also do co-location[2] and if you want to talk about saving money?   if you need north of 32GiB ram, you can save a huge amount of money over a year by buying hardware and co-locating it.   Actually, the hardware cost of a dedicated server?  as a rule of thumb, it's less than what you charge the customer for 4 months rent.  (Of course, you have to pay for power out of that, so I don't pay off the server in four months, but you get the idea.

It&#x27;s that systems are all classified to handle information at a given level, and if you find e.g. TS/SCI information on an FOUO system, then you have to investigate it and take corrective action (which often means wiping or even reclassifying the system). So, rather than deal with a huge mess of pointless investigations of classification violations, they&#x27;re just trying to keep the data entirely off their systems.",1372424354

John Woo&#x27;s point is that the U.S. courts cannot supervise the President&#x27;s execution of a war on foreign soil, because the Constitution invests the President with sole power, as commander in chief, of how war is conducted. Crushing a child&#x27;s testicles is a graphic example designed to invoke an emotional response, but it&#x27;s logically indistinguishable from any other activity, no matter how minor or how egregious, if the premise is that the courts have <i>no authority</i> to second-guess how the President executes a war. And after all, is it really such a controversial concept? Very few people would argue that the President didn&#x27;t have the authority to vaporize Hiroshima and Nagasaki with nuclear weapons, without consulting Congress and without being second-guessed by the courts. If he can do that, what&#x27;s left?",1372424326

5957678,comment,5956926,5957151,2,0,pron,,,"I used to think that, too, but Clojure is not dynamically typed in the same way Ruby, Python, Javascript or Groovy are. The most important difference, from a maintainability point of view, is dynamic dispatch. All those other languages can call any method on any object. If the object has that method - it runs; if not - something else happens. But other than comparing method names, you have no way of knowing whether method foo in object A is indeed an override of method foo in object B, or whether it does something else altogether.<p>Clojure is entirely different. When you write (f x) you know exactly how f is going to dispatch by looking what f is in f&#x27;s namespace: either it is a simple function, a protocol method implemented by x (just like interfaces in Java) with the protocol defined in f&#x27;s namespace, or a multimethod in f&#x27;s namespace.<p>So in Clojure, you don&#x27;t have dynamic dispatch at all other than Java-like polymorphism or multimethods whose implementations are confined to a single namespace.",1372424289

5957676,comment,5956404,5957055,3,0,thetwiceler,,,"Actually, this example makes Euclid even more of a logician. Recall that Euclid stated his Fifth Postulate (where his postulates really mean axioms). Geometers for thousands of years afterward, guided by intuition, attempted to prove that in fact the Fifth Postulate could be proved from the other axioms. But by the 19th century, it was actually clear that Euclid was correct to include the postulate; had he not included the postulate, his geometry would not convey what he wanted to convey. Euclid in this way was fundamentally a logician! He realized that he needed the Fifth Postulate to prove facts about a geometry he imagine (e.g. angles in a triangle sum to two right angles), and included as an axiom something that others intuited must be derivable from the others.<p>But as Poincare mentions, we can also see that Euclid DID have much &quot;intuition&quot; in his works. In modern days, we do not consider Euclid&#x27;s Elements a rigorous work of logic, mainly because his definitions are not rigorous definitions; he says a point is &quot;that which has no part.&quot; Hilbert remedied Euclidean geometry in the 20th century, with a work that has some undefined objects (points and lines) and precisely defines the rest. He needs something like 24 axioms, as opposed to Euclid&#x27;s 5.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see where Euclid&#x27;s logic breaks down. Look at his very first proof - the construction of an equilateral triangle. He constructs two circles and looks at their intersection. How do we know we can build the circles to intersect? He draws us a picture and it seems obvious :).<p>But in Hilbert&#x27;s Euclidean geometry, we need what I think of as a really nasty axiom in order to ensure the circles intersect: &quot;Axiom of completeness. To a system of points, straight lines, and planes, it is impossible to add other elements in such a manner that the system thus generalized shall form a new geometry obeying all of the five groups of axioms. In other words, the elements of geometry form a system which is not susceptible of extension, if we regard the five groups of axioms as valid.&quot;",1372424226

And they will continue to be good editors for the foreseeable future. Just like Vim and Emacs. You don&#x27;t need a newer version every year. Even though Vim and Emacs DO release newer versions, I have no idea what is in the new releases. Why? Because Emacs 22 and Vim 6.3 do well enough. Textmate 1.5 does well enough. Sublime Text 2 does just fine.<p>2. I get the bus factor ideal, but it doesn&#x27;t always turn out that way. Sure it&#x27;s a chance, but look at the Jack Slocum, ExtJS situation. He was a one man show. He was a machine that could output beautiful amazing work. Then he actually let Sench Labs take over. He seemed to disappear for a time. They had a few stumbles. Now he&#x27;s back. Same could happen. The same could happen for Sublime.<p>Overall. I don&#x27;t see it as a hinderance. Watch Railscasts or Peepcode.

Do you also wear a tin foil hat while having such thoughts?<p>First, quantum computing is one of those fields for which you need the brightest minds to solve it. Government jobs may still be attractive for researchers, but if they need to keep such developments a secret, it means they have to limit themselves to the people they can actually hire. This means their talent pool will be more limited than that of a company like Google, or a university like MIT, organizations that can always collaborate with whomever they want in the open, including foreign companies and universities. For building a practical quantum computer, they can have big budgets too, given that companies like Google are interested in machine learning, not to mention the pool of investors that would be dying to be a part of the next revolution. Some of the brightest minds we have worked on quantum computing already, in the open. The idea that a single country&#x27;s government would be able to do a better job, in secret, is preposterous.<p>Second, quantum computing doesn&#x27;t solve P = NP. The difficulty of brute-forcing AES-256 is only reduced to that of AES-128. It is something, but not much and that&#x27;s only speaking about asymptotic complexity. Going from a feeble experiment in building a quantum computer to building farms of such computers to run distributed algorithms on them - well, I can assure you that farms of commodity hardware with capable GPUs will be used instead for a really long time.",1372421992

Recently this icon was replaced with a custom one, which makes sense, except the new Dash icon seems to be heavily &quot;inspired&quot; by somebody else&#x27;s work -- <a href=""http://dribbble.com/shots/913643-Chrome-replacement-icon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dribbble.com/shots/913643-Chrome-replacement-icon</a><p>See the comparison here: <a href=""http://twitpic.com/ciu8a7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitpic.com/ciu8a7</a><p>Relevant tweets:<p>[Dash dev]<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/kapeli/status/328037766166368256"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/kapeli/status/328037766166368256</a><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/kapeli/status/328112260805451779"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/kapeli/status/328112260805451779</a><p>[Icon designer]<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/wakaba_en/status/328075341618892800"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/wakaba_en/status/328075341618892800</a><p>Seems like the Dash dev disagrees with the icon author on where the line between &quot;inspiration&quot; and &quot;plagiarism&quot; lies. It doesn&#x27;t help that there&#x27;s a language barrier between the icon author and Dash developer.<p>Icon designer even proposed an alternative icon:<p><a href=""http://dribbble.com/shots/1046492-Dash-app-replacement-icon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dribbble.com/shots/1046492-Dash-app-replacement-icon</a><p>But sadly it seems like this issue hasn&#x27;t been rectified, but has just been forgotten about.

5957466,comment,5955866,5955866,3,0,pbsd,,,"> Ideally the DH group would match or exceed the RSA key size but 1024-bit DHE is arguably better than straight 2048-bit RSA<p>So let&#x27;s argue!<p>It depends on how you presume the attacker is gonna get you. Suppose the attacker is well-funded enough to go after one RSA-1024 or DH-1024 instance. Unlike RSA, however, DHE tends to work modulo the same prime over and over. This has consequences for cryptanalysis: once the attacker has solved a single DH instance, they can solve the next one much faster [2]. In the case of 1024-bit DH, the subsequent instances can be solved in about 2^55 time (versus about 2^80 for the first log); this is not instant, but it&#x27;s pretty quick for a well-funded and skilled attacker.<p>Where 1024-bit DHE does shine versus 2048-bit static RSA is against other, less Hollywood, types of key retrieval such as outright hacking.<p>[1] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2409#page-22"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2409#page-22</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.iacr.org/archive/pkc2006/39580175/39580175.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iacr.org/archive/pkc2006/39580175/39580175.pdf</a>",1372420956

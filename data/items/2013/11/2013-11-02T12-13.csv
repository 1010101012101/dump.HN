This article has a couple, but I would love to see the source for: &quot;Many farmers still don&#x27;t like DST, including some dairy farmers, who find that cows&#x27; natural milking schedules don&#x27;t adapt easily to a sudden shift.&quot;<p>Farmers aren&#x27;t stupid and cows can&#x27;t tell time.  Do you really think they adjust the actual time they milk cows in order to observe DST?  A schedule on a farm has far more to do with actual daylight hours regardless of the official &quot;time&quot;.<p>However, they did get the sentiment correct.  Farmers have always opposed to changing the time twice a year and largely think the whole idea is ridiculous.  Case in point, Saskatchewan does not change their time, but permanently maintain the equivalent of DST year round.  Tellingly, there is no debate about adopting time changes either.",1383394742

5197139,comment,5196666,5196904,5,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Want to revolutionize education? Figure out a way to 1) reliably detect the optimum education environment for each student, and 2) give it to them.</i><p>Finding out what learning environment, inside or outside school, is optimal for each learner is definitely a worthy goal, especially if means are then provided to obtain that environment. Education policy is the issue that drew me to participate on Hacker News,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123</a><p>and I'm glad to see that so many participants, from the founder on to the newest member, enjoy thinking about and checking facts on education issues.<p>To achieve the worthy goal mentioned in the parent post involves changing the incentives now operating in the school system in most countries, both as to direct regulations and as to funding. Mark Blaug, one of the co-founders of the academic discipline of economics of education, wrote about this over the decades of his career: ""The education system is a formalised, bureaucratic organisational structure and, like any bureaucratic organisational structure, it strives for maximum autonomy from external pressures as its cardinal principle of survival. While ostensibly devoted to the education of children, teachers, school administrators and local education officers must nevertheless regard parents acting on behalf of children as a force to be kept at bay because parental pressures in effect threaten the autonomy of the educational system. . . . I would hold that the stupefying conservatism of the educational system and its utter disdain of non-professional opinion is such that nothing less than a radical shake-up of the financing mechanism will do much to promote parental power."" -- Mark Blaug, ""Education Vouchers--It All Depends on What You Mean,"" in Economics of Privatization, J. Le Grand & R. Robinson, ed. (1985).<p>I have seen some examples of helpful reforms where I live. The state of Minnesota in the United States had what was called ""the Minnesota Miracle"" in the 1970s, state legislation that changed the pattern of school finance so that most funding for schools is distributed by the state government on a per-pupil enrollment basis.<p><a href=""http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html</a><p>The funding reform in the 1970s was followed up by two further reforms in the 1980s. First, the former compulsory instruction statute in Minnesota was ruled unconstitutional in a court case involving a homeschooling family, and a new compulsory instruction statute explicitly allows more nonpublic school alternatives for families who seek those. Second, the Legislature, pushed by the then Governor, set up statewide open enrollment<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.h...</a><p>and the opportunity for advanced learners to attend up to two years of college while still high school students on the state's dime.<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index...</a><p>Parents in Minnesota now have more power to shop than parents in most states. That gets closer to the ideal of<p><i>detect the optimum education environment for each student</i><p>(by parents observing what works for each of their differing children)<p>and<p><i>give it to them</i><p>by open-enrolling in another school district (my school district has inbound open-enrollment students from forty-one other school districts of residence) or by homeschooling, or by postsecondary study at high school age, or by exercising other choices.<p>The educational results of Minnesota schools are well above the meager results of most United States schools, and almost competitive (but not fully competitive) with the better schools in the newly industrialized countries of east Asia and southeast Asia.

If you don't have reasonably strong spatial skills, chances are you're not going to find in pleasure in ""exploring"" K-12 mathematics. I went to engineering school and made it through on a ""okay this is the equation I have to use"" basis because for the life of me I couldn't visualize even simple things like order of rotations not being commutative.

The correct answer to that is always ""Because you are the sort of person who asks that question, you won't need it.""<p>Why not, instead, optimize for the most usefulness of knowledge.  If a student is interested in math, they should receive extra attention in math, rather than the attitude of ""Oh, good.  A student that I can ignore because they'll learn it on their own.""

A student that I should continue teaching because they will remember it five years from now.""<p>This has turned into a bit of rambling, but in summary, schools should focus efforts on people who will use the information given, rather than focusing efforts on temporarily boosting mediocre students who will just forget the information after the test.",1360518791

Once you start thinking of operations as transforming streams of text, then you start thinking of tasks in terms of smaller units.<p>For example, a few minutes ago I needed a way to upgrade all global `npm` modules.  I knew there was a way to get JSON lists (npm list -g --parseable --json), which lines I wanted (the ones starting with '    ""'), and what I want to do with those (get the name and install).  Putting it together, one straightforward way is<p><pre><code>    npm list -g --parseable --json 2>/dev/null | grep '^    ""[a-z-]*"": {' | sed 's/^ *""//;s/"".*$//' | while read x; do sudo npm install -g $x; done
</code></pre>
Now, the documentation doesn't explain that this is a way to do what I want.  But the documentation gives enough information to know where to look.",1360517015

Because it is so common to have unstable linux-software but the so highly popular Windows is so stable.<p>I once had to start Windows in Rescue Mode and do some weird stuff there just to get Steam back running. It failed to start suddenly and seemingly without cause. For a while (some years ago) I couldn't boot Windows at all until I unplugged a dvd-drive (linux was running fine) - I still use that dvd-drive, windows starts with it again. I bought GTA 4 and couldn't play it because Games for Windows Live wasn't working (still doesn't, but i found the hidden offline-mode). Sometimes I can't delete files in Windows with no cause whatsoever.<p>At the same time, I'm using a rock-stable Ubuntu LTS with a custom ""desktop environment"" on the same hardware and never had any real issues i still remember. Oh, thinking a bit longer about it, there were some issues when upgrading to this lts: plymouth didn't stop itself (i had to end it via the rc.local) and pulseaudio didnt work (switched to alsa).

They're still better than about 90% of manufacturers out there in terms of usability and quality overall, and I think sometimes we get a little spoiled and forget that.<p>For example, my D-Link Wi-Fi base station makes me cringe every time I have to go into its configuration menus. It's quite literally their top-of-the-line piece of hardware, but it looks like the configuration was designed by a teenager who just took an HTML class in 1998.<p>On top of that, it drops the connection constantly and sometimes needs to be restarted just because it stops working entirely. This was a replacement for an Apple AirPort Extreme that my roommate took with him, and I thought ""Oh this will be good enough, it's half the price,"" and surely I've spent more in time and frustration dealing with it than that money was worth to me.

5196923,comment,5196551,5196776,4,0,abraxasz,,,"This is something that has bugged me for a long time: how do people consider a ""language reference"" as a good documentation? Maybe it's because I'm not a programmer, so I'm not used to reading language references, but when I'm picking up a new language or a new tool, the most important things is to have examples on how to use the language to get things done. Take the unix manual for instance. The first thing I do when checking the manual is to search for example. Reading the list of switches is useless to me unless I have a working example of how the thing works.<p>So a good thing is a tutorial that guides people to the main parts of the language, explains the pitfalls, etc. I had to use mathematica to check some derivations about 6 months ago, and I spent a whole day trying to figure out how to work with it, and honestly, I nearly drowned under the documentation. There seems to be many ways to do the same thing (take the derivative of a function) and it is not always clear how/why should we use one method over the other.<p>Another problem I have with mathematica is that although the different functions are extensively referenced (I won't use the word documented), the language itself is not very well explained, and by language I mean how to piece all the functions together and more into one coherent piece of software.<p>Now I haven't spent enough time with it for my judgment to be definitive, but I found it harder to pick up than most languages / tools I've used.",1360515671

I have been using it since the G1 and 2.3 felt different to 1.6, but the real change for me came with 4.0 (I had 3 on my Xoom but it felt awkward).

Everything is cleaned up and simplified, it&#x27;s easier\n    to understand and change, and even in advanced cases you\n    won&#x27;t have to know anything about blueprints/semilattices.\n  - Really, this is about to get dramatically better. I can&#x27;t\n    summarize it in a bullet point, we put an enormous amount of\n    effort into this in a thousand different places.\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s what&#x27;s coming immediately after that:<p><pre><code>  - Automatic failover\n  - Always-on resharding (no more resharding downtime)\n  </code></pre>\n(The reason why these latter updates are coming after the API overhaul is because they require a lot of simplification/refactoring/redesign internally as well as externally, and we wanted to do it piecemeal).<p>Thanks for writing up your feedback and sticking with RethinkDB despite the limitations of clustering 1.x.

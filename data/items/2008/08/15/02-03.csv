I ignored all the samples, and typed:<p>what's the biggest city in the us?<p>The response was:<p>""Sorry, but 'what's the biggest city in the us?' is not understood by the system.\nThe system does not understand what the word ''s' means.""<p>Which was disappointing.<p>2. Next up:<p>does portland have a bigger population than seattle?<p>Response:<p>Sorry, but 'does portland have a bigger population than seattle?' is not understood by the system.\nThe system does not understand what the word 'bigger' means.<p>Boo. Also the word 'system' has no meaning to ordinary people, and only vague meaning for the rest of us.<p>3. Have you considered using a greater dataset for a better demo? Ie, police crimes, or CC data from wikipedia?<p>4. Show us what you can do on the front page. I don't give a damn about your sepia toned dude writing on a blackboard, or your brown colored optical fibre stock image, or that you, like everyone else, intends to be the prime supplier of whatever the hell it is you do.",1218769027

276710,comment,276692,276692,0,0,zacharye,,,"I think the main issue is that the concept of a reverse auction is not practical for the seller in an online environment. In a reverse auction, the seller must work for a sale whereas in a conventional auction the site and the buyers do the work for them. Why should the seller ""work"" for a sale if (s)he doesn't need to?<p>On the flip side of the coin, it is generally accepted that if a consumer wants to purchase something (s)he must shop for it. So far attempts to revamp this process have not been widely adopted. Ebay tried a reverse auction segment of the site for a while and I don't think it worked out very well. That's not to say it can't be done of course, just that eBay couldn't do it with its approach - and all of its resources.",1218768345

Different strokes use different muscle groups, which is why even Phelps has some weaknesses.<p>It is stacked in the swimmer's favor though.

276706,comment,276687,276687,0,0,gcv,,,"I guess I always understood the principles behind full-on REST using all the neglected HTTP methods as a way of enforcing clean API design. Good programmers can, of course, just use POST methods for an API, and not cause grief. Others might need some nudging in the right direction: ""no, that's closest to a deletion so use DELETE; and that's closer to a store so use PUT.""",1218768064

276692,story,,,4,8,yrashk,"Ask HN: (General-purpose) Reverse Auctions — undeveloped or needless?",,"I've been playing with an idea of reverse auctions a bit — it appears that there isn't much reverse auction systems around — at least nothing that you can compare with even a fraction of forward auctions' market.<p>Though I am not sure — does that mean nobody's really interested in reverse auctions (neither buyers nor sellers) or is this niche is just undeveloped and will kind of welcome new players?<p>Of course there is no firm answer, but what do you guys think about it?<p>P.S. From Wikipedia: ""It is a type of auction in which the role of the buyer and seller are reversed, with the primary objective to drive purchase prices downward. In an ordinary auction (also known as a forward auction), buyers compete to obtain a good or service. In a reverse auction, sellers compete to obtain business.""",1218766335

Interestingly enough, in order to actually do this, you need to scan, photograph, or otherwise digitize it to begin with, so the output of this is both what you seek (a scanned image) AND the actual content.

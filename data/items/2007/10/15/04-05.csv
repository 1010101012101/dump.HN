(It's good for everyone except entrepreneurs).<p>I've got plans in the back of my brain for combining linkblogs, the Atom Publishing Protocol and something like <a href=""http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/09/03/MeMeme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/09/03/MeMeme</a> into a decentralized version of reddit/digg/news.yc, but I already have too many projects on the go.<p>The really nice thing about the idea is that it allows for a lot more experimentation with the best ways of aggregating and sorting through the massive quantities of URLs that are available. Right now only big players like Reddit and Digg and have big enough data sets to really experiment, and they're naturally reluctant to mess with a formula that's working for them.",1192424229
67912,comment,67826,67891,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Yay for mentioning Slashdot!<p>Slashdot has a good system, but for increased granuarity users actually need to think more about what they're voting, instead of what is possibly a subconscious, wholistic, instantaneous judgment, which seems pretty applicable for Digg. So there's a tradeoff for a system to be ""easy to use"" rather than ""intelligent.""<p>In this sense the UI becomes a bigger challenge than the data processing. See <a href=""http://x-o-o.com/news.php?sort=new"" rel=""nofollow"">http://x-o-o.com/news.php?sort=new</a>\nIt's a dictionary-supported rating system with granular voting, in the sense that you can vote 10 or 0.1 if you choose to do so; it also supports weighted voting.<p>It is much harder to use than digg though so such a system probably will not reach popularity. But I think theory wise it is the best implementation.",1192423859
67911,comment,67826,67842,0,0,sethjohn,,,"It does seem like a ""weighted"" voting system defeats the purpose of having a voting system at all. What's the point of asking everyone to give their opinions if the only opinions that will matter are those that conform to the opinions of the editors!?<p>Of course, in truth I might be quite happy with this system. I've liked what the editors have let through so far (though last few days less so) and I would probably rather read what they suggest than what the ""group"" suggests.",1192423785

It seems to me that the two-step process is still broken though, because ""important"" is not a well-defined word. The best system I have seen online, which actually does a decent job of utterance categorization, is Slashdot. Based on the Gricean Maxims and you can come up with some core cirteria for any given utterance, and /. actually covers them surprisingly well. Obviously it's still not a perfect implementation, but they have done a good balance between categorization, ease of categorization, and evaluation of categorization. They really need to grow out of the +5 limit though.<p>While /.'s criterion are good, they don't cover enough ground to become a universal system; it doesn't scale to other cultures. There's a lot more to this I think, but I'm just be rambling again.",1192423261

67905,comment,67630,67658,0,0,Shooter,,,"I've never used GoDaddy's ""negotiation"" services, but I have used them to ""backorder"" a domain.  If the current owner lets anything lapse, you have a chance of getting the domain.  It rarely works out, but I have gotten a few good domains that way.  I think they charge around $18 to backorder a domain.  There are, of course, other registrars that provide the same service...or you can just build your own script to monitor for changes.",1192423114
67904,comment,67630,67647,0,0,Shooter,,,"The last time I tried Sedo they had a minimum transaction amount. And just their FEE on that minimum transaction amount was more than I was willing to pay for the actual domain I was interested in!  I've never seen anything I would consider a ""deal"" on Sedo.<p>I'm assuming they still have that minimum transaction size...?",1192422704

That would normally just make the squatter see dollar signs.<p>I've only SEIZED CONTROL of a squatted domain once, and I had to send trademark documentation.  [Since most squatters are just speculators they don't bother to register the names as trademarks.  If they are redirecting within your industry (and the class you got the trademark in), it is easy to get control of the domain.]",1192422412

As an outsider with an interest in the community I often wonder why it is so small and how the situation can be improved. Everyone keeps going on about how beneficial functional programming is over imperative programming: faster development, shorter code, less bug prone and easier to test to name just a few.""</i>",1192422098

67898,comment,67630,67678,0,0,Shooter,,,"You can look at various services to get a very rough guesstimate at how much traffic the domain gets...Alexa, Comscore, etc.  You can also check the number of backlinks, etc.  That's basically all the domainers do.  Ultimately, you just have to judge what it is worth to you, though.  It is rarely worth paying the quoted price.<p>Most ""appraisals"" from domain companies aren't worth the paper they're printed on.  Everyone massively overestimates the value of 95% of domains...especially if they own the domain in question.  Inflation of domain prices is so pervasive and out of control that it is almost humorous.  There is a reason that most of the domains in the world are just 'parked' by squatters...MASS PSYCHOSIS.",1192421979
67897,comment,67630,67653,0,0,Shooter,,,"I was quoted $275,000 for a domain last January.  It's a very good name in a competitive market (mortgages.)  <p>I say, ""Oh?  Well, gee, I only had $1000 budgeted.""  <p>They said ""We're willing to negotiate."" They offered it for  $100K...then all the way down to $25K.  They won't budge from there, though. <p>[Four months went by] <p>They contacted me to see if I'm still interested.  I ended up paying $1300, but I had to wire the money IMMEDIATELY.  Turns out they had an unexpected expense come up.  I almost felt bad...<p>That will NEVER EVER happen if the domain you want is owned by a professional domainer company, though.  They won't even usually talk to you, no matter how much cash you have to throw at them.  They consider it too 'time-consuming' to even field the offers.<p>If you want to hear a sob story...I used to own SI.com.  I was planning on using it for a Spanish language portal.  I sold it for WAAAAAAY too little money.  Now, of course, it's Sports Illustrated.  It would have made a better Spanish language portal, dammit!",1192421469

In fact, once you substitute ""reduce $/GB over time"" for ""scale"", the article becomes totally obvious.

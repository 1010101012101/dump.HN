I know Bank of America unloaded my loan to Fannie Mae a week after they gave it to me.<p>If that is true, their negative answer to you is probably not predicated on the interest income stream you are giving them now, since they are receiving only some of that.<p>As for withholding payment, here is what I believe.<p>If we assume that Wells Fargo does actually hold your loan, and you stop making payments, the bank has two choices.  Foreclose or negotiate.  If the value of your house is less than what is currently owed on it, it makes sense for them to negotiate.  This is the situation that has allowed this ""stop making payments"" meme to spread.  However, if the value of your house is more than what you owe, and after 6 years, I suspect it is, than I believe they'll foreclose and flip the house.",1338580786

The best way to be a Pro Se is to hire outside counsel to advise you, but to do all the dirty litigation work yourself.  If this company has hired an outside attorney to litigate, this person could make that a very, very expensive proposition for them.  I think this company's board would grow very concerned at legal expenses exceeding $100k with no hope of recovering from the defendant.

That is, there is some value epsilon such that the difference in conversion rate is on every round at least epsilon.  However, at some rounds it could be more than epsilon, and it doesn't necessarily vary according to any fixed distribution.

I know this is a sensitive topic and wouldn't dare to discuss it anywhere other than HN. I have two question/comments and would definitely would like to hear your feedback on them:<p>1. You (and some others) seem to equate any attempt to ""fix""  the situation as an affirmation that your condition is an inferiority and therefore reject such attempts (e.g. I know many people in the Deaf community reject cochlear implants due to this reason and out of fear that they would be rejected by the community). Yet, they don't have to be so opposed to the other. A famous example is Oscar Pistorius (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Pistorius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Pistorius</a>) who have qualified for the Olympics in 400m. He is using artificial legs but I don't he views himself as an invalid.<p>2. Coming back to the desire of some Deaf parents to have a non-hearing child: If you think that Deafness is somewhat a cultural artifact then there's nothing wrong with this (I want my son to be fluent in my native language in addition to English), yet ethically this idea seems wrong (e.g. I could only find an old example online: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/mar/09/genetics.medicalresearch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/mar/09/genetics.medic...</a>), here's a discussion on the subject (<a href=""http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_wanting_a_deaf_baby_if_you_are_a_deaf_couple_ethical_or_unethical_and_for_what_reasons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_wanting_a_deaf_baby_if_you_are_...</a>).",1338580056

There is even an axiom that goes ""For every difficult problem there is a solution that is both easy to do and wrong."" or something like that.<p>The <i>reason</i> ideas are so cheap is that they are only the reflection of an action, not the action itself. Often folks take what they 'want' and then ponder a way to 'get' that and poof! idea. Like ""I 'want' to work on my car's engine computer, all I need to do is take the engine out and mount it on an engine stand and hook it up to my laptop!"" Simple idea, remove the engine and instrument it, but actually doing that is a lot of work. (doable, just a lot of work).<p>But this can also be a useful tool. Ideas that <i>aren't</i> a lot of work to implement but seem to have high value are usually useless. And if you can't tell why they are useless then it is sometimes worthwhile to pursue them enough to understand where the real work is.<p>But take something that is pretty much pure software. Let's take electronic publishing briefly. You have no doubt read a paperback book, you've no doubt read one (or looked at one) on an e-reader. All words, no pictures, just chapter breaks, perhaps the occasional font change to represent internal vs external dialog. Why can't I cut the spine off my old paperback, feed it into my Fuji Scansnap1500, and have it drop a .epub file that works on a kindle/nook/ipad/whatever ? The scansnap will give me a nice PDF of that book, even searchable. Caliber will convert it into a horrendous epub file. Why isn't this a no-brainer? I'd pay $20 for that software, no problem.<p>Idea, no execution. Marginal return on investment (while I would buy it if it worked well, there is no assured market here) There are bodged together ad-hoc solutions out there. Clearly there is <i>some</i> demand but as Gabe called out, you need passion. You need to want to build this because you want it to exist. And <i>that</i>, that passion, is not there.<p>I tell armchair politicians, hey run for city council. Solve problems. If you are good at it people will give you bigger and bigger problems to solve.

(We add in some extra stuff, such as the torrent's name and size so it displays faster in torrent clients).<p>From that hash, torrent clients will join the Distributed Hash Table ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table</a> ) and ask around if anyone has seen this torrent.

We need:<p>* A generational GC, preferably bump-allocating so that we can win on allocation-heavy workloads.<p>* A non-thread-safe GC, because all GC'd data is local to a single task in Rust (and we enforce this in the type system).<p>* A precise GC, because (a) we don't want accidental or malicious leaks due to misinterpreting non-pointers as pointers; and (b) because we need precise GC metadata to clean up shared data and run destructors when tasks fail.<p>* An incremental GC, because minimizing pause times is absolutely critical for browsers.<p>* A non-copying GC, because LLVM doesn't currently support copying GC satisfactorily (i.e. when allowing pointers to live in registers). Fixing this would require a significant portion of all target code to be rewritten.<p>Also of particular interest is the ability for individual allocation sites to choose to bump allocate only, in the interests of performance (but at the expense of fragmentation).

We already have good reasons to be concerned that a high-cost biological attack could be launched out of someone's literal garage, and it is not an irrational fear; we have plausible plans on how it could be done. Indeed I'd argue that being unconcerned about it is irrational, and being unconcerned about it because so far ""terrorists"", a small subset of the group of people I'm concerned about, have only managed to ""fly planes into a couple of buildings"".

Though filesystems are adding a bit of extra data to it compared to the GC, (filenames, locations, etc) a number of the design constraints and things seem to be very very similar.  Like the idea to keep track of what's free and doing the allocation seem to have very similar solutions even given the different constraints.  I think part of this might also be because some of the more modern filesystems are being designed to also consider SSD which end up even closer to normal memory.  The way that (at least at a layman's understanding) btrfs seems to handle COW looks very similar to how this new garbage collection is being designed for lua.

However, due to the politics and industry regulation that is still being decided, this will actually sway the direction of DNT and make it useless (as many users have pointed out here). There are two fundamental things to keep in mind:<p>1) There will always be ads on the internet. We are not moving to a direct pay internet economy anytime soon.\n2) Behavior targeting is significantly more effective than other types of targeting including the context based approach heavily favored by privacy advocates.

Because of this, the advertising companies will find ways to keep doing behavior targetting - ranging from the benign like site retargetting to the more troubling association with private data.<p>DNT as an opt out solution is great because it allows people who probably won't click on ads to say they don't want them. Private users and advertising companies both win. But third party cookies exist for a reason and if they are removed from the equation then advertising companies will simply find another way.",1338577786

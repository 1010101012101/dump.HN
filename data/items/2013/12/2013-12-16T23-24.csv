However this will fracture Apple&#x27;s product lineup, thus economically unfeasible.<p>b - screen on iphone 5S is already very strong.<p>c - After lots of thinking I agree with Apple. Current form factor is just right for communication device [1]. If you need bigger screen, chances are you do not want a phone - you want a tablet.<p>[1] Iphone user here, take this with a grain of salt. Over 3 models of iphone I never had a case. Phone is small enough for a proper grip with one hand while using thumb to control it.<p>Anecdotal experience: I know 12 people with phones that have large screens. 7 of them had screens cracked due to dropping the phone. Every single one has a case (People who dropped their phones got a case after). What is the point of getting super light and thin phone just to put bulky case on it?",1387238393

At every company I had to sign a generic NDA to not disclose customer information without consent from the company. In the end though, you don&#x27;t own this data, the company you contract with for service does - you&#x27;d need to change the contract with them to get control over it.<p>Adding the restrictions you propose would just make things more complex, not better.

6918758,comment,6917194,6918641,4,0,MichaelGG,,," I&#x27;ve written tools for VoIP companies for diagnostics. The most helpful system is one that logs everything and has it available on-demand. The one I wrote literally recorded and indexed every call-related packet (except audio) and records were kept indefinitely. This is network-level traffic. It reduced time-to-resolution by at least an order of magnitude, since a ticket to the effect of &quot;this weekend someone at the office called someone in Germany and it didnt work&quot; could find out exactly what happened.<p>Apart from that, call detail records (CDRs) are available to many people in a telecom. And it doesn&#x27;t matter if you trust your telco, because they probably hand off traffic to others in many cases. Even large companies like AT&T deal with very scummy third-parties to get the cheapest prices to place calls. (I know that first hand, because sometimes people sell call capacity they don&#x27;t have. Instead of completing the call, they answer and play a fake recording of someone saying &quot;wait a sec&quot;. Once, when dialing from my AT&T cell, I got the same exact recording I had PCAP&#x27;d from some third-rate provider.)<p>Unlike email, where you don&#x27;t need to provide access to email records in most cases, CDRs are needed for all aspects of billing. While your complete profile may be relatively safe in a large company with internal controls, depending on your calling patterns, you may very well be leaking a lot of details to many third parties you&#x27;ve never heard of.<p>Edit: You could theoretically add all sorts of controls and access-limitations. There&#x27;s really zero benefit to doing so. Plenty of companies still rely on techs being able to run tcpdump on a mirror port or server in question.",1387238179

And anybody familiar with coding for crappy systems that sported hardware scrolling would use the same technique, because your options are limited when the screen moves due to base address changing and yet you want in-memory sprites (i.e., bits copied into screen memory by software or hardware, rather than images drawn automatically at a particular position during the scan) to move independently while drawing nicely on top of the background. And for full-screen scrolling games it is usual for at least the player sprite to stay centred. BBC Micro examples from the 1980s would include JCB Digger, Uridium and Firetrack. I bet Atari ST and Amiga games did the same thing too; the principle extends obviously to multi buffering.<p>The cunning part of the Carmack games was presumably widening the screen - I don&#x27;t think I ever saw this done on the BBC. But as a schoolboy in 1989/1990 I&#x27;d experimented with reducing the BBC&#x27;s screen height by one character row (by tweaking R6) to avoid flicker when scrolling vertically. Same principle.

They may try to do it <i>now</i>, but I don&#x27;t think they were planning for it. From recent news it seems they were more interested in jumping on the &quot;8-core&quot; bandwagon (you&#x27;d think they learned their lesson when they rushed out their first quad core chip, the S4 Pro, in order to catch-up to everyone else and also have a &quot;quad core chip&quot;, but no, they didn&#x27;t).<p>So how do I figure this? Because their first 64-bit chip they&#x27;ve just announced a few days ago (Snapdragon 410) is an ARM one! That blew my mind. Why? Because Qualcomm licenses ARM&#x27;s architecture in order to build its own cores, and that <i>should</i> mean that they are coming out with a next-gen core <i>faster</i> than ARM&#x27;s &quot;stock cores&quot;. And yet their very first 64-bit chip is based on ARM&#x27;s stock cores?<p>That made it pretty obvious that Qualcomm was not prepared at all to make an ARMv8 chip, and I think it was mainly laziness, because of the nice position they enjoy in the Android market right now. They thought they could squeeze 3 years out of the 32-bit Krait, when normally it should&#x27;ve been two.<p>Well the joke is on them. I certainly won&#x27;t buy any phone in 2014 that isn&#x27;t 64-bit, since I usually change my phones every 2-3 years, and I don&#x27;t want to buy one of the <i>very last</i> 32-bit phones.<p>I was actually expecting Qualcomm to release its own custom-made ARMv8 core <i>early 2014</i> - and on 20nm! So I can&#x27;t believe Qualcomm was actually going to rest on its laurels to such degree that they weren&#x27;t even planning to switch to 64-bit, and probably 20nm either, even in 2014! That&#x27;s insane, and only a company that thinks it has too much monopoly power in a market would do that.<p>As Andy Grove used to say - stay paranoid about your competition. A paranoid company would&#x27;ve expected at least to <i>some degree</i> Apple to release its first 64-bit chip this year. But they didn&#x27;t even have to do that. They just had to follow the <i>original</i> plan. The one that says release a new core every 24 months, and on a new process node (the one ARM is also following).

The new 64-bit A7 chip is the smartphone  equivalent of a big V12 engine.&quot;<p>Except these performance gains most likely would of been seen on a 32 bit version of the chip.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see how much marketing is put around 32 vs 64 bit chips and the effect it has on how people market.

We usually think of finite state machines as these little objects with a few states, but the category theory version of them is an essential definition of what it means for a system to be deterministic and depend only on current state and given inputs. It&#x27;s a set of allowable input tokens (the input log), a set of allowable output tokens (the output log of actions taken by the system), an internal state Q, a dynamics delta that decides the next state from the previous one, and an output function lambda that decides what output token to return given the current input state.<p>By making the statement that logs are streams of tokens which have deterministic effect, this author is assuming that the services are finite state machines. This may not be the case if, for instance, they do not set random number generators to a known state. Any way a service doesn&#x27;t just depend on its previous state violates this principle. If it meets this principle, then the logs are, by definition, taken from the strings of allowable input tokens X or the strings of allowable output tokens Y.<p>The debate in the article about at what level to log is a debate about which portion of the service to treat as an FSM. It boils down nicely.<p>Oh, a dense but beautiful article on this is Machines in a Category by Arbib and Manes.",1387236793

The truth, as happens often, lies in between.<p>The simple fact of moving to 64-bit does little. It makes for slightly faster computations in some cases, somewhat higher memory usage for most programs, and makes certain programming techniques more viable. Overall, it&#x27;s not hugely significant.<p>The ARM architecture changed a bunch of other things in its transition to 64-bit. An increased number of registers and a revised, streamlined instruction set make for a nice performance gain over 32-bit ARM.<p>Apple took advantage of the transition to make some changes of their own. The biggest change is an inline retain count, which eliminates the need to perform a costly hash table lookup for retain and release operations in the common case. Since those operations are so common in most Objective-C code, this is a big win. Per-object resource cleanup flags make object deallocation quite a bit faster in certain cases. All in all, the cost of creating and destroying an object is roughly cut in half. Tagged pointers also make for a nice performance win as well as reduced memory use.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-an...</a>",1387236609

The REAL benefit is the ability to address memory beyond 4GBs. But even the most high-end phones are stuck with 2GB... hell, a number of <i>laptops</i> are still shipping with 2GB of RAM. Let alone phones. The 64-bit &quot;advantage&quot; is almost entirely a marketing gimmick.<p>That said, it is a known fact that Apple&#x27;s iPhone chip is leagues ahead of its competitors in terms of performance / watt. Qualcomm has a value buy with Snapdragon and their integrated LTE chip + FCC conformance. But Apple has full integration, and controls the software / hardware from bottom up. That is a real advantage that is leading to improved battery lives and faster performance.<p>(This is less an &quot;Apple Advantage&quot; and more of an &quot;Android disadvantage&quot;. Android should be able to catch up if they got their act together... but the reliance on Dalvik-VM code and unoptimized APIs leads to noticeably worse battery life)<p>Beyond that, Apple is beginning to invest into state-of-the-art foundries, possibly to create chips in house by the year 2016 or 2017. They&#x27;ve also bought out the high-end 20nm wafers through 2014, forcing their competitors to lag behind on the older 28nm process nodes. (Hell, even AMD / NVidia are feeling the sting. All AMD / NVidia roadmaps to better GPUs are at 28nm technology... Only Intel: who has reached 14nm on their in-house labs, remains unaffected by Apple&#x27;s purchasing power)<p>When your company has $100 Billion in cash, you can afford to have a process node advantage over your opponents.",1387236603

For his time and machinery, I pay him a few thousand dollars.<p>How do these two situations compare?  My neighbor is arguably &quot;exploiting&quot; workers who are down on their luck.

6918461,comment,6913467,6913467,17,0,pflanze,,,"I still remember a hack that I figured out on the Commodore 128 to speed up the 80 column display. I&#x27;m not aware of any program that actually made use of it (probably because the C128 and its 80 column display did not have a big enough user base to make it worthwhile to develop programs that needed speedy output).<p>The C128 had two separate video chips/ports, a C64 compatible chip showing a 40x25 character (320x200 pixel) display, and the &quot;VDC&quot;[1] showing 80x25 characters (640x200, or with interlacing, 640x400 or more), which was output on a separate connector. The VDC had a hideous way to change the display: it had its own video RAM, which the CPU couldn&#x27;t access directly, instead the video chip had two internal registers (low and high byte) to store the address you wanted to access, and another register to read or write the value at that address. But that wasn&#x27;t enough, the CPU couldn&#x27;t access those VDC registers directly either, there was a <i>second</i> indirection on top: the CPU could only access two 2nd-level registers, one in which to store the number of the &#x27;real&#x27; register you wanted to access, then you had to poll until the VDC would indicate that it&#x27;s ready to receive the new value, and you would save the new value for the hidden register in the other 2nd level register. (There&#x27;s assemply on [1] describing that 2nd level.) Those two registers were the only way of interaction between the CPU and the 80 column display.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VDC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VDC</a><p>This was extremely slow. Not only because of the amount of instructions, but the VDC would often be slow to issue the readyness flag, thus the CPU would be wasting cycles in a tight loop waiting for the OK.<p>Now my discovery was that the VDC didn&#x27;t always react slowly, it had times when the readyness bit would be set on the next CPU cycle. Unsurprisingly, the quick reaction times were during the vertical blanking period (when the ray would travel to the top of the screen, and nothing was displayed). During that time, there wasn&#x27;t even a need to poll for the VDC&#x27;s readyness, you could simply feed values to the 2nd level interface as fast as the CPU would allow, without any verification. Thus if you would do your updates to the screen during the vertical screen blank, you would achieve a <i>lot</i> more (more than a magnitude faster, IIRC), and the &quot;impossibly slow&quot; video would actually come into a speed range that might have made it interesting for some kinds of video games. Still too slow to do any real-time hires graphics, and the VDC didn&#x27;t have any sprites, but it had powerful character based features and quite much internal RAM, plus blitting capabilities, so with enough creativity you might have been able to get away by changing the bitmaps representing selected characters to imitate sprites. And you could run the CPU in its 2 Mhz mode all the time (unlike when using the 40 column video, where you would have to turn it down to 1 Mhz to not interfere with the video chip accessing RAM in parallel, at least during that chip&#x27;s non-screenblank periods.) My code probably looked something like:<p><pre><code>        lda #$12       ; VDC Address High Byte register\n        sta $d600      ; write to control register\n\tlda #$10       ; address hi byte\n        sta $d601      ; store\n        ldx #$13       ; VDC Address Low Byte register\n        ldy #$00       ; address lo byte\n loop\n                                                            cycles\n        stx $d600      ; select address low byte register   4\n        sty $d601      ; update address low byte            4\n        lda #$1f       ; VDC Data Register                  3 ?\n        sta $d600                                           4\n        lda base,y     ; load value from CPU RAM            4 ?\n        sta $d601      ; store in VDC RAM                   4\n        iny                                                 2\n        bne loop       ; or do some loop unrolling          3 ?\n        ..\n</code></pre>\n(28 cycles per byte, at 2 Mhz, => about 300-400 bytes per frame. Although the C128 could remap the zero page, too (to any page?), and definitely relocate the stack to any page, thus there are a couple ways to optimize this. (Hm, was there also a mode that had the VDC auto-increment the address pointer? Thus pushing data to $d601 repeatedly would be all that was needed? I can&#x27;t remember.))<p>How would you time your screen updates to the vertical blanking period? There was no way for the VDC to deliver interrupts. It did however have a register that returned the vertical ray position. Also, the C128 had a separate IC holding timers. Thus IIRC I wrote code to reprogram the timer on every frame with updated timing calculations, so that I got an interrupt right when the VDC would enter the vertical blanking area.<p>As I said, I&#x27;m not aware of any production level program that used this; perhaps some did, but at least the behaviour was not documented in the manuals I had.<p>The VDC felt even more like a waste after I discovered this. The only use I had for it was using some text editor. I wasn&#x27;t up to writing big programs at the time, either.<p>PS. sorry if that was a bit long.",1387235004

There may have been multiple abiogenesis events, but life on earth stemming from other abiogenesis events has either died out, merged so as to be functionally indistinguishable, or has not been discovered.  I am unaware of anyone working in biology under other models.<p>I suspect, as you do, that any Martian life will likely be recognizable as &quot;life&quot;.  The long term fear is of course that either things from earth will eat all of it, or it will eat everything from earth (that&#x27;s less of a concern since quarantine in that direction is pretty easy).  The short term is what we really need to be concerned about though.  In the short term, the concern is that Martian life will be mistaken or written off as life from Earth.<p>This problem is exacerbated when we consider that the life on Mars that we are looking for could be former Earth life that hitched a ride on some rocks millions or billions of years ago.  If we scoop up some Martian soil and find a few  rather prokaryote-ish looking things bopping around in it, then exactly what we have just found becomes very hard to determine if our spacecraft was not sterile.  Did it just find an example of convergent abiogenesis and evolution?  Evidence of panspermia?  Or did somebody in the assembly building sneeze on the scoop?",1387234811

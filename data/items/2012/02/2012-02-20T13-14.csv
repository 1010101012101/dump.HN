In an IDE, the editor is a small part of the overall program, and it indeed does often suck compared to the godfathers. But it's such a small part of the actual task of working on software that I'm ok with a few tradeoffs. On the other hand, whoever ever tried to debug java or c++ in emacs, or even worse, debug a single app consisting of php, ruby and javascript in emacs is going to enter a world of pain. A task which is pretty easy to accomplish in Intellij IDEA.<p>Eclipse makes it pretty easy to keep the muscle memory with its emacs+ mode, which is quite good (it even has ido and M-x). You lose the elisp, but have a real IDE nonetheless.<p>It's all about the work you need to accomplish, I find myself much more productive with a less capable editor, but a full IDE. And I still use emacs a lot for org-mode, editing config files, writing smaller programs. But emulating full IDE features is just to painful (most of the time).<p>The only area where Emacs is actually a brilliant IDE is when using SLIME (for Common Lisp and Clojure).",1329743455

In fact, VAT is actually the easiest tax-dodge of all: just buy through a business and you can claim VAT relief, getting an effective 20% discount on everything. Say you are a graphic designer with your own Ltd company: you can now buy your Spider-Man DVDs, file them under ""research expenses"", and get 20% back (or whatever VAT is in your country). There are guidelines on what is acceptable, of course, but they are enforced only to a degree. Where they are strictly enforced, it's <i>exactly</i> because the system itself is otherwise wide open for abuse by individuals.<p>As soon as your business is large enough and diversified enough, abuse cannot realistically be detected -- your 3-people agency will indeed need DVDs for research... and printers, iPhones, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers... most small-firm owners and CEOs never pay VAT, as simple as that.

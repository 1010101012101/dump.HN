2323603,story,,,1,0,mhspecter,"Herschel Specter",,"With regard to your information box on the three nuclear facilities, if offsite power was actually available it is unclear why there would be any problems at these power plants or why plant operators would turn to the emergency diesels. With a huge earthquake and a subsequent tsunami it is unlikely that offsite power would be availbale. Please check this statement about offsite power being available.<p>After much more information is known and carefully analyzed it would not be surprising to get a very different understanding of this tragic event. My guess is that we will realize that this event represented a very large economic loss to Tokyo Electric and a very small health risk to the public. Such a conclusion would be consistent with analyses at Sandia National Laboratories which has examined hypothetical extreme accidents where all active safety equipment that relies on emergency electric power were assumed to have failed, causing the reactor to have a full core melt. These Sandia studies showed that even in this rare situation, very little radioactive material would be released into the environment. It appears that nuclear power plants of the type now in trouble in Japan act like large, complex passive filters trapping much of the radioactive material on site. This major conclusion is the result of natural chemical and physical processes that are immune to terrorism and huge natural initiating events, like enormous earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.",1300125586

However, if the item is never paid for, you can request eBay to credit you the FVF.<p>Yesterday I called eBay to get my credits, which they gave promptly. However, I noticed that the credited amount was off by one cent. I explained to the representative on the phone that I was able to see the credit, but was curious as to why it was $.01 less than the FVF. I asked if they kept a penny, assuming they did, but she assured me that the full amount was refunded in both cases. Again, out of curiosity I pushed the issue and she insisted that the full amounts were credited ($13.48 and $14.55) even though I explained that what I saw on my eBay account was different.<p>I was being incredibly polite and merely inquisitive (it's 2 cents for god's sake) but she rudely stated ""I can't help you anymore, if you have more questions, then you need to use the eBay help menu online"" and hung up on me.<p>Ouch.<p>$13.48 charged, I was refunded 13.47.
$14.55 charged, I was refunded 14.54.<p>Since we're literally talking pennies here, I don't care enough to call eBay back, but I'm curios as to what caused this.<p>I assume this is a rounding error from taking a percentage of the amount (possibly a floor function being used for credits). This all reminds me of Office Space, and made me wonder how much money eBay makes off of these penny differences, if this indeed happens all the time.<p>Has anyone ever come across this before, or am I an anomaly?",1300125397

2323578,story,,,2,0,Jer3784,"Social Networking Concept - Complex Identity, Managing Interests/Interactions",,"Recently I have been taken back by the whole concept of social networking.  While I have been a user of Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter for a few years now, I never really saw it as a career option.  However, one day I was messing around with a non profit music website that I was having created and noticed that my possibilities were limited.  In turn I decided to expand on my idea, but instead stumbled into something much more large scale.<p>What should one do next?  Well... I started to create my layouts and talk to my webmaster about development (I'm not a programmer).  The problem was, I instantly was very naive about the process.  I just assumed that because this was someone I worked with before, that he would automatically share my vision for the project and nose dive straight in.  To put it lightly, I was wrong.  However, a lot of good came out of it.  I began to push myself further and further towards my goal.  I watched hours of Youtube videos from start-up founders and social media gurus, plus I read a number of articles and the book The Facebook Effect.  The scary thing was, while I have never been a tech guy, the concepts that they were wishing were created were the very same things that my social networking concept would fix.  Of course the problem being, I'm not a programmer and most things look better on paper than executed.  A tech member in my family sent me here for advice, So I want to know if anyone here thinks my vision is possible and if they know anyone interested in jumping aboard.<p>We all know that everyone is working towards moving into the web 3.0 stage.  However, most people aren't aware that the current social networking giants are behind the curve when it comes to the actual social part of their projects.  While Facebook is the current leader, even their vision is hazy at this point.  They want people to have only one identity online, but fail to realize that someone's identity is very complex and cannot be housed on one single page or profile.  In an attempt to collect already existing data and organize it, Diaspora was created.  The problem there is, you are still only limited to the options that the narrow minded social networking profiles are providing.  Through my concept, everything is scaled back to just being purely social.  Instead of taking on an approach of being a ruler of the internet like Facebook wants to be as a platform, Twitter wants to be as mobile tool, and Myspace wants to be as a media outlet, my concept is to bring people back to the AOL days, but within social networking.  My vision is simple.  I want to improve the way people socially communicate online, in order for them to take that new perspective out into the offline world.  Of course, in doing so we would work with existing networks like Facebook, considering they are already an integrated part of how users already communicate online.<p>The biggest reason why Facebook has gone wrong is how limited they allow users to be in their interactions.  Because of the new layouts, users have a very difficult time meeting new people through the service.  Because of this trend, users have become numb to the process and rarely let people in who are not in their already offline network.  Of course this is because of privacy issues and the fact that people aren't aware of who they might be able to trust.  After all, Myspace forces you to give up the majority of your information to the world, while Facebook has an all or nothing mentality.  With my concept, not only have I developed an easy system for people to want to seek out people based on their interests, but I thought up a tool where people can control exactly what individuals can see what information.  This takes social networking back to its core, where Facebook and Myspace should have been.<p>Since an identity is complex, the profile holds more information than that of other networks.  In return, the profile process acts as an offline interaction does.  As you communicate more with a person, you gain access to more information and the communication gets more intense.<p>I have also factored in major parts of people's lives such as entertainment and a way that they can support talent while in return gaining access to tools that can help them and their friends outside of the internet.<p>I know this is a very general take on my concept (which is fully laid out).  But I just wanted to extend my hand and see if anyone here has a passion for projects such as this and might be interested in the coding aspect.<p>Thanks",1300125351

There's a lot of wiggle room in that term, and probably some assumptions that need to be challenged.<p>If we assume that ""voluntarily"" means that you expect your developers to simply stay late without any investment of effort on your part, then good luck to you - I hope your developers REALLY believe in your company. You want something for nothing, and personally, I'd comply long enough to get another job. My life is too short to spend it ""killing time"" on your project.<p>If we assume that you are willing to invest in the environment or other workplace changes, but not willing to compensate your developers financially for extra time, then I think that you're going to want to be careful what message you're sending so you get the most bang for your buck, so to speak. Ordering dinner (and not just pizza by default), for example, would be a good start. Most of the time, I'm hungry in the evening, but if I'm staying late I'm not going to be thrilled about spending 30+ minutes to go get my own food. I'm going to be thinking ""great, this is 30+ minutes later I need to spend when I get back."" Giving me clear direction for what you need and why you need it now is another biggie. If you're asking me to stay late, clearly you have some task in mind so make sure I understand exactly what you want to see so I don't waste my time. Making it clear that you are doing whatever you can to remove the reason I'm here late is another biggie. To paraphrase, lack of planning on your part does not constitute a good reason to give up my evenings on my part. If you're asking me to put in 12 hour days, I'm not going to be amused by the addition of a pinball machine or other games (I have worked at a startup where the other developers managed to squeeze in 8 hours of work and 4 hours of ping-pong in every day and bragged about ""working"" late). I'm at the office late because you need something done, and anything that doesn't make that goal easier so I can hurry up and get home just reeks of management missing the point.<p>If we assume that you are willing to compensate your developers financially for their time, then make sure that this is a win for both parties. Time after hours is time that your developers can't spend doing other things. Evenings are time with families, for example. Evenings are a chance to spend time with friends away from the office. Evenings are a chance to unwind with hobbies. I value my evening hours more highly than my midday hours because I have a family and that's when it's easiest for me to spend time with them. If I'm not going to make it home for dinner, I don't want to tell my wife ""honey, I need to work late but it's okay - I'm getting an extra $50 out of the deal."" That figure needs to be high enough that the decision is easy. I also do contract work after hours, so if my day job wants me to stay late, I'm forced to either give up sleep to meet those obligations or I'm giving up weekend time. You're shifting the array of my life around, and that's an inconvenience I would like to be compensated for. I'm not asking for something ridiculous, but I think a premium atop my regular rate is in order.",1300124876

In bridge, there are four players, conventionally called North, East, South, and West; after the auction, one player becomes declarer; let's say that's South.  In this case, North, across the table, is dummy, and East and West, on either side, are defenders.  Dummy's cards are turned face up so everyone can see them; declarer plays both her own hand and dummy's.<p>When declarer sees a total of seven clubs (let's say) in her own and dummy's hand, she knows that the defenders have six clubs between them, but she doesn't in general know how many each defender has; this is called the ""split"".  A 3/3 split means each has three; a 4/2 split means one has four and the other has two.

""Forest fires can have beneficial effects. Charcoal enriches soil, and some plant species flourish in the wake of conflagrations. The cones of the jack pine tree, for instance, will not release their seeds unless exposed to intense heat. Sequoia or Douglas fir trees grow best in open sunlight areas, such as those cleared by fire.<p>Natural fires also remove dead wood and tangled brush. For these reasons, the Forest Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers 17% of all U.S. forest reserves, often allows fires, especially when started by lightning, to burn in carefully monitored areas.""<p>Edit: The Parent (up deus) post stated ""Nature ruins its own shit right?"" not necessarily if you look at the world as an entire ecosystem.

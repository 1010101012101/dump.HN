I&#x27;m not anal retentive about it, I drink socially when I&#x27;m out with friends and chose not to be out with friends on an every evening basis in order to circumvent that &quot;limitation&quot;.<p>I was surprised how much energy is actually drained of you from drinking and how much more productive you can be during those evening hours.<p>As an added bonus I sleep - and awake much better.<p>I don&#x27;t tend to compensate by drinking more on weekends.

She responded with an anecdote about a clerk at a shop in Switzerland who had recently refused to show her an expensive bag, even though she repeated her request multiple times.

    &quot;That one will cost too much, you won&#x27;t be able to afford that,&quot; Winfrey claimed the clerk told her.

    That shop assistant, identified only as Ariadna N., spoke to Blick on Sunday, and denied Winfrey&#x27;s version of events. Ariadna said she showed Winfrey the Jennifer Aniston range of bags, explained that they come in different sizes and materials and pointed out a less expensive alternative when Winfrey expressed interest in the 35,000 franc (more than $37,000) purse at the top of the display.

These are rooted in more conventional warfare than we&#x27;ve seen recently, but I&#x27;m less than convinced that they would be rare in a major conflict.<p>These conventional missions demand speed and stealth not only to penetrate evade enemy air defenses, but also to keep up with  intelligence on mobile/time-sensitive targets. This timely delivery problem is hard to accomplish with small numbers of loitering aircraft or where the target has advance warning.<p>Also, given the proliferation of advanced mobile SAM and radar systems, I&#x27;m unsure of the assumption that US aircraft will have clear skies in a future conflict. Certainly in the early days of any conflict this will be untrue, and those are the days where strategic bombing will be most valuable; disrupted enemy infrastructure allow ground forces to move without resistance.<p>Thus, I think there&#x27;s a need for both roles--CAS and penetrating bomber--and it seems to me that the USAF is actually tackling these separately, efficiently. While the Reaper lacks a large payload, it seems that the large numbers providing spatial coverage will have sufficient munitions in aggregate. The B-2 was designed to be the penetrator.",1376552051

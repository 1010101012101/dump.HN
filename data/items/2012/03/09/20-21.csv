3685887,comment,3685258,3685258,2,0,philwelch,,,"So there's two things here, the notion that developers need to go to college, and the analogy to basketball via the notion that NBA players are better off after having played in college. I'm going to expand and examine that analogy first and then draw it back a bit.<p>The reason for college basketball (as a talent pipeline to the NBA at least) is because college basketball incurs no cost on the NBA or its teams to operate, just like college football for the NFL, but <i>unlike</i> minor league baseball or soccer academies in Europe and (secondarily) run by some MLS teams. The average professional athlete (by which I mean someone who makes their sport the focus of their lives, rather than someone who gets paid), in most team sports, is only ready for top level play in their early 20's anyway, which roughly corresponds to college graduation. So it works out.<p>I don't know much about minor league baseball, but I do know a bit about soccer. In soccer, different players develop at different rates. Some players, like Lionel Messi or Wayne Rooney, can start as young as 16. More often, a player will break into top-level play between 18 and 21. While some of the more special and talented players will start younger, most players, some world-class, broke through after age 20; goalkeeper Joe Hart broke into top-level play at 22 in 2009, and defensive midfielder Sergio Busquets broke through at age 20 the year before. As far as anyone could tell, this is because those are the ages that those players were ready. But this is because youth players come through academies run by the clubs themselves. If a player is ready at 16, they'll play him. If a player is ready at 22, they'll play him. Just like sometimes a basketball player is ready at 18 and doesn't need college ball.<p>Of course, it's worth the expense to develop players in specialized academies when players can be worth millions; developers aren't so valuable. But they are just as individuated, and some will be ready at a different age than others, and college isn't necessarily the best way to prepare them.",1331326506

If you're using it as a TODO list, you're doing it wrong.</i><p>That means most business users of e-mail are doing it wrong. Take a sample of heavy e-mail users (managers, sales people, marketing, etc.) and ten out of ten will tell you that they're inundated by e-mail, and that it is a defacto todo list. E-mail <i>is</i> a giant problem for everyone who needs to communicate with a large number of people professionally, and ""you're doing it wrong"" is not the answer.

I'm only pointing out that his definition of ""worth it"" appears to me to be somewhat inconsistent. If the fourth album by that artist he mentions was ""worth it"" because he liked the other three, why weren't the other three ""worth it"" as well, once he knew he liked them? The fact that he already had them for free is irrelevant; by his own admission, he could have gotten the fourth album for free as well, but he chose not to. I don't see why the same logic that drove that choice wouldn't also drive him to go back and pay for the other three after seeing their quality.<p>> He wrote this with the objective of telling content creators directly instead of assuming that they'll just figure it out.<p>This brings up another key point: the distinction between ""content creators"" and ""content distributors"".

Universities suck because they don't have to provide what they are needed for, they only have to compete with each other. The service the universities should provide is the preparation of its students for the betterment of the world. However, what this means is debatable, and the hippies of the 60s that grew up in an environment where they didn't have to work their asses off (like the teenagers of the depression era) are the ones teaching our kids how to feel better about themselves by building a hut in a 3rd world country.<p>> 4. kill hollywood<p>The studios are the only ones that really know how to produce.

Anything beyond that is out of scope. This is why when I do UI work it is always hourly based, when it comes to the UI everyone is an expert because they have an opinion about what they can see. Some of them will even ignore blatant research and force you to conform the interface to their opinion. Taking UI work on anything other than hourly is a dangerous proposition because it is where an overwhelming majority of changes are made. The other area is adding completely new features, you have to isolate both of those from a fixed price contract. New features are pretty easy, if it is not in the spec it is a new feature. UI is more difficult it is subjective that is why having a third party guideline as the definitive agreement is an important arbitrator. If they fail to read it that is on them, further call out an hourly rate above the contract for customization and new feature work. Finally, if you have a client that does not understand that you deserve to make a living wage for your effort you need to walk away, there are many people that expect others to work for slave wages for some reason. Counseling them in fairness tends to be a moot point and burns up more of your time, as soon as you spot the tell tail indicators that you are working with someone that views others in this light, you have to walk away no matter how deep you are in, people such as that will see that they are getting more than their fair share and milk the situation.",1331325542

You're already in that business.<p>- The problem you are solving is hairy.  Shaving the problem doesn't make it go away.   Things always come up to ruin a schedule.<p>- Trivializing the issue means it's on it's path to potentially becoming another calendar or to-do list that does neither well, because we always have to manage both, integrated.  I've probably tried 30+ apps over the years to handle my workflow, and it's been a tough go.<p>- Instead of a to-do queue, it's different types of appointments with your time : unscheduled, tentative (floating), and scheduled.<p>- Appointments for your time (""tasks"") come into an inbox (GTDesq but simpler) and end up on a list.  The list gets put into categories (nothing more), which are the GTD contexts (Phone, online, email, home, etc).  You can then drop the categories on your day into blocks of hours and the list fills itself, according to the ranking you give everything, and any dates you might assign.  :)<p>- Floating task advance notice - One other thign that's critical is having an advance notice for a task or appointment.  Sometimes i like 2 days, other times 10 days.  I like being able to set that without a separate reminder entry.  It just starts showing up in my list early (lower ranked than the rest of my current stuff on an earlier day).  I can start thinking about it or start tackling it in advance... it ends my last minute rushes.<p>- Each task can be bundled to handle other things of a similar context.  I can show you what I do.  It works like gangbusters.<p>- Mini Reviews: Omnifocus came close but their calendar view isn't how it needs to be.  Any.do has great UI integration but their calendar view sucks. Astrid is a lot better, and has different types of syncs, their calendar view is a bit better.  GTasks for android is the diamond in the rough, the calendar/todo list view was perfect, but entering, categorizing and syncing of tasks is still coming along. The Datebk6 calendar view is the best I've ever found.<p>There is a very good chance I talked about DateBK5 / Palm apps.. check my history, I'm almost sure I have.

I specifically left iOS to use this app because I knew he gets me.  Actually, his app is the one that taught me to be productive, lol.  It's not perfect though and I think Faraday has things I really want too.<p>Why am I sharing all this?  I just want to pay $20 for an app that does all this instead of building it and getting distracted from my core business.  I've often thought of sinking in my own money but as you know, building a polished, gestured app isn't a $1-5,000 app development effort. :)<p>I have spent 10+ years being completely and constantly overwhelmed with having too many projects on the go and getting them all done somehow, and that somehow becoming the norm that I can be peaceful with it as much as possible.<p>What I learnt is more complex solutions don't work as you get busier.  They have to be simpler, quicker and easier than scribbling something down.  Everything has to go to one inbox, including emails.

Witness the uptick in aggressive IP enforcement actions: high stakes patent battles, domain seizures, arrests.<p>This, coupled with improved legal digital delivery methods, are going to make typical pirating actions more like regular crimes. It will still exist but will be the province of actual anti-social criminal types.<p>Then his arguments will come to be more along the lines of: I pirate because I can get away with it. Like saying, hey, the locks on your car suck so I can take your shit.<p>So as the car owner (imperfect analogy I know) does\nhe expect you to give up and just leave the keys in the ignition? Instead we will see the vigorous attempts to create locks that are good enough to keep most people out and increased efforts at enforcement to arrest the rest.<p>The problem with this is that since it is inherently harder to lock a digital product, increased resources are being put towards enforcement.<p>This is dovetailing with law enforcement actions against hackers.

The causes of this were varied.<p>On 16-bit Windows there was a single address space and only a single version of a DLL could be loaded by all processes: the first one to load would ""win"", and the others would get screwed with the old copy. This was due to 16-bit Windows not having memory protection: it was more of a GUI over DOS, and thereby had cooperative multi-tasking.<p>Even with that fixed, many developers would require a slightly newer version of a library, and rather than ask the user to upgrade their system (an irritating consequence of not having packages or dependencies; APT FTW ;P) would just include the DLL in their installer <i>and unconditionally overwrite any existing copy</i>.<p>After the dynamic loader started supporting ""local"" versions of libraries (installed to the same folder as the application), a similar problem happened with COM objects, which are centrally registered: someone would install their own version of a shared GUI component, register it with the shared name, overwriting possibly-installed newer copies.<p>Both of these problems were actually solved, but way too many developers simply gave up on Microsoft and Windows beforehand, and then refuse to spend the time to learn about the improvements. In essence, Windows now has reasonable-ish package management, with dependencies: Windows Installer.<p>In addition to dependencies and versioning of packages (which can then be correctly tracked by Windows, much like APT on a Debian/Ubuntu box), Windows Installer supports the notion of ""unified installer program"" with ""merge modules"": in essence, you can include someone else's package inside of your package; that way the dependencies can correctly be checked, and old versions won't get overwritten.<p>There are still a few cases that are quite difficult to manage (involving libraries that require a modified ABI over time, but still receive updates), and Microsoft's solution to those is WinSxS. Honestly, while I'm much less familiar with it than on Unix, it only seems a constant multiple more crazy than .la files, which I believe solve a similar problem.<p>These technologies and improvements were all introduced at or before Windows XP, an operating system that was released just over a decade ago. Of course, these are all solutions that developers sometimes ignore, but if you download software for Linux that comes with a .sh installer that scribbles into /lib, you are in for similar ""hell"".",1331324798

Go for it.<p>However, I'm also a software engineer for a medical device company and I spend a great deal of time assessing and mitigating the safety of various operations. Please take care to understand the failure modes of anything you build and attach to your own body. When you get to the point of using an Arduino (or anything else that uses software), the number of failure points goes up dramatically. Try to consider how <i>anything</i> could fail and what the consequences will be.",1331323209

However, the presentation covers a bit of what worries me about Play.  Play rewrites the bytecode for things like emulating properties and allowing you to pass whatever you want to the templates and have it automatically name the variables based on their local names in the calling method.<p>For me, the reason to use Java over Python or Ruby would be to move away from some of the behavior used in those languages that can make debugging and static analysis harder.<p>I've used Play for some hobby stuff (and kept up on Play 2.0).  Play 2.0 seems to remove the former system for passing variables to the templates in favor of a system where templates accept certain parameters with types (a welcome change for me).  However, at least the last time I played with it, Eclipse couldn't tell me what variables and types the template was expecting.<p>I guess Play leaves me feeling like it brings the magic to me without as much ease that Python and Ruby offer (or, at least, without as much familiarity).  That might be changing - I think that the changes in the templating for 2.0 show a clear move in that direction.  I really wish them well since it's always good to have more good options for development and there's a lot of Java already out there to leverage.",1331323206

They don't carry on with that motif. As others have said who I've shown the video to, it's more about emotion and compassion -- practically the exact opposite of what some are gleaning from it.",1331323204

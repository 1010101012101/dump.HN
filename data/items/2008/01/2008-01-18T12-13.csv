Just in case anybody gets it into their head to do innovative things with web-accessible databases of facts, Brussels has given us the wonders of the EU Database Directive, which makes raw data copyrightable. Phone books, registries of commerce, postal code databases, train timetables, and other such things that cannot be copyrighted in the US do fall under a copyright-like _sui generis_ IP regime in the EU.<p>Not that there isn't a case for sometimes just ignoring the fancy details of the law and going with ""do first, ask permission later.""<p>But I thought maybe you should know.",1200659404
100278,comment,100091,100091,0,0,weel,,,"I agree that computer displays suck for reading. But there is one important, very simple lesson to be learned from this about computer typography: while in print, serif fonts are always easier to read for long stretches of text and sans-serif should be used only for display (headings and the like), on computer screens it really helps to have very simple fonts with the minimum possible amount of embellishment. Some sort of Helvetica derivative is always easier to read, especially in small sizes, and even with the fanciest subpixel rendering, than a complex thick-and-thin serifed font designed with high-quality print in mind.<p>BTW, I haven't seen a Kindle yet. Somebody I know has one, but he doesn't live in the area and I'm unlikely to meet him for quite a while. Are they any more pleasant to read from than a computer screen?",1200659214

I'm not sure if it is relevant to hacking or to startups, but it is entirely sensible.<p>If A sells to B sells to C sells to A, then they have just created three trade deficits. This is why ""the trade deficit with China"" is an utterly meaningless concept. Maybe China sells things to the US, which sells things to Mexico, which sells things to China, or any other transitive combination, and voila, a trade deficit.<p>The only trade deficit that is somewhat meaningful is the trade deficit of a country with the rest of the world, all of it. Now even that trade deficit needs to be taken with a grain of salt. If the US has a trade deficit with the rest of the world, you have to wonder for a minute why on earth the citizens of all those other countries would be so happy to send goods America-bound and not to receive equal value in return. Whence their charity? How come the free lunch?<p>When a good economist smells a free lunch, s/he smells murky accounting. And indeed, there's murky accounting in the trade deficit. Oftentimes, services are not included. Even if they are, then investment isn't. It just so happens that the US is a good place to invest, relative to other countries, because it has a very well developed economic and financial system that can take advantage of capital well and bring high returns in capital-intensive industries. China, on the other hand, lacks the institutions required to make capital-intensive industries quite as lucrative, but it has cheap labor. Thus both countries specialize, but the Chinese investments flowing into the US bought with the money that Americans paid the Chinese to buy their goods--those investments simply do not count.<p>Hey! A deficit!<p>Is it a big deal?<p>Mwah... no.",1200658769

100272,comment,100172,100172,0,0,weel,,,"To be entirely honest with y'all, I haven't carefully read all of this article. But I already have my opinion ready!<p>The fact that MapReduce is a step back, in a sense, is true. But it's a step back from a dead-end alleyway, a step away from a particular very complex and bloated programming model--to wit the SQL-based RDMS--that is good as far as it goes, but requires so much effort to implement that it is unlikely to be a great model to use as the basis for innovative implementations.<p>If you're going to do crazy shit of the sort that google does, massively distributed computations on very high volumes of data, then in order to do it well you have to keep it simple. Such is life. There are plenty of RDMSes that can do the full whammy of RDMS features, but try to take, say, one that does not allow for replication and then implement replication. See you next decade.<p>Sometimes taking a step back can help put things into perspective, is all I'm saying.",1200658366

Informal, a large variety of smart people, but each smart in their own way, that had a lot to genuinely learn from each other.<p>Sadly, conferences, even comparatively small and informal once, take some effort and some money to put together, and frankly it's not going to be me who is capable of coming up with either.",1200658114

10565481,comment,10543171,10554055,0,0,alphapapa,,,"You should read the links you cite before you cite them.  Among the answers found on that page are these:<p>&quot;The 1-6-11 recommendation contained in Cisco&#x27;s whitepaper about IEEE 802.11 deployment in the corporate environment certainly does not apply to all circumstances! For example, in moderately congested neighbourhoods, one stands a very good chance to benefit from not sticking to this proposed scheme.&quot;<p>&quot;the situation usually gets worse when one voluntary abides to the 1-6-11 non-overlapping channel scheme. Doing so will expose your devices to the IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS/ACK (Request to Send / Clear to Send / Acknowledge) of alien devices, effectively silencing your devices and hence forcedly lowering your bandwidth. This problem is known as the exposed node problem. In a corporate setting this problem can be solved by synchronising the nodes. In the wild, this is not readily achievable.&quot;<p>&quot;In big corporate networks it&#x27;s common practice to use channels 1,6 & 11 because it is fairly straightforward (at least on a diagram) to design non-overlapping cells of coverage. As a home user you don&#x27;t have the same constraints so it makes sense to experiment and look for the best channel.&quot;<p>&quot;I am a Ham Radio operator. I have done extensive testing. On my Actiontec or ZyXcel, channel 1 is abysmal! Channel 11 is a close second to the death of channel 1. ACTUAL power readings put 3 and 4 as the strongest signal output and throughput. Channels 6 and 9 are the standard preset. so actually avoid 1,6,9,11. I am a DSL tech also. I have walked people through changing channels from 9-10-11 to 3 or 4. They are amazed at the doubling of the wifi signal on all devices across the board.&quot;<p>&quot;Hence, I call for actually measuring one&#x27;s own signal-to-noise level...The Quality value takes into account noise from overlapping channels.&quot;<p>The bottom line is as I said: test your own equipment in your own environment and find what works best for you.",1447505499

I was intently reading but soon realized that it was all over the place and started having to skip through to try to dig out the main points.<p>* They admitted that they weren&#x27;t even working at Apple during the time when it was designing successful products.<p>* They admitted that iOS 9 solved many of the problems quickly at the end without saying which ones or how they failed and while introducing new problems (memory?) that only served to confuse the reader.<p>* The authors&#x27; argument was incoherent. It seems to be building up reasons why Apple&#x27;s design was bad, but they are all over the place. &quot;It&#x27;s just bad&quot; is not an argument. Lay the groundwork. Provide evidence for each point and evidence against arguments against those points. Tie it all up.<p>Some of the information in here would make great articles on their own, e.g. I&#x27;d like to read a full criticism of Apple&#x27;s new font, how the Human Interface Guidelines list changes over the years and how it could be better, and the whole Dieter Rams piece would have made an excellent article even outside of the context of Apple&#x27;s failures.<p>I think few that have been using iOS and OS X over the years would dispute that Apple has dropped the ball since Jobs&#x27; death. While much of Apple&#x27;s design still trumps others&#x27;, others have blindly followed Apple and done an ever worse job. (I&#x27;m looking at you, Windows 8, which was a reaction to both iOS&#x27;s use in the iPad and the terrible AppStore trend introduced in OS X.) Hopefully, Microsoft, Google, and others have realized by now that leading and innovating doesn&#x27;t mean copying or reacting out of fear to Apple&#x27;s direction- it means hiring extremely creative people that understand user-centric design.<p>But, even though there are problems at Apple and with design worldwide thanks to Apple&#x27;s mistakes, the authors of this post haven&#x27;t made it much clearer <i>why</i> they dropped the ball or how we can all understand how to avoid those problems.",1447505367

If you just stick to the project coding guidelines most of the time you&#x27;ll get code review, advices, requests and then contribution going to be accepted. Easy.<p>In same time when you&#x27;re UI designer it&#x27;s not easy. UI designer would have to prove that his version of UI is better and why.

The platform is slowly becoming more consistent but there is still a way to go. We now have a design library. It is a great step in the right direction but it needs to evolve a lot.  Particularly, Google apps should always use the same implementation of a widget (whether it comes from the public design lib or a private one). With the nav drawer, at first there was no common implementation in the support/design lib, so each team implemented one with small differences, for 6 months it was very maddening.<p>- Navigation patterns. Google encourages the use of tabs for 0-depth apps with a few options. Good, that&#x27;s indeed a strong pattern.  For more complex apps though, the only solution pushed by the system is the Navigation Drawer. I have got to admit that Google uses it well with all the important features accessible from the first screen and only the secondary use cases hidden in the drawer. Third party apps generally get that entirely wrong. That&#x27;s not always a good pattern though and I would really like to have an alternative for complex apps pushed by the platform.

A lot of people do tend to choose pictures or characters that look a bit like what they look like in real life (or in a lot of kids case, what they wished they looked like).<p>P.S. Am I the only one somewhat surprised about the &#x27;ages figured from usernames tend to match what was entered on registration&#x27; aspect?

Your thesis seems to be that by throwing more resources at the problem the vault could be made more secure.  Likely true, but at what cost, both in hassle and money?<p>You seem to be arguing for overengineering without considering the costs.  Should the failsafes also have failsafes, should the backups have their own backups?  And what if the additional security measures add additional risks? Take #4, ""human patrols"".  Unless implemented very carefully, greater access for security personnel could well add more risk than benefit.<p>I'm not even sure that one should argue that the vault failed from the point of view of the owners.  It was designed well enough for them to do their daily business and such that they were able to obtain insurance on the contents.

515046,comment,514767,514895,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> <i>""And another minor point, we know of divergent evolution for things as complex as large animals, like echidnas and hedgehogs. And that article talks about all virii sharing the proteins to make their capsule, and implies they all inherited it from a common ancestor. But isn't that an extraordinary claim? Isn't it just as likely for there to have been multiple origins and we're just looking at convergent evolution? For things that simple, how many ways to build a capsid could there be?""</i><p>IIRC there are a few different mechanisms for capsuling a cell, however it's all controlled by all the environments it can be expected to combat. One of the main things that inhibits viruses is high temperature, which is the main reason why you often get a fever when you're sick with a strong variant of the flu.<p>In viruses it appears the protein layer serves the function perfectly, it's capable of replicating fine at human body temperature, it can deal with the acidity present in certain parts of our body (however, most cannot deal with direct exposure to stomach acid, they usually take the trip inside a chunk of food) and in certain viruses allows easy modification of their surface markers by a change in their amino acids. IIRC the protein surface also enables the easy stealing of the lipid layer from a human cell, which they use as camouflage. The protein capsid can easily attach to the lipid layer and also has a higher rigidity than a human cell, possibly to enable its passage through the cell membrane... I mean a virus wouldn't be very good if it just bounced off of a human cell or if it got crushed when trying to pass through the lipid layer.<p>It appears the protein layer serves a wide range of purposes quite expertly, which would suggest that viruses would likely evolve to use the same protein without connection. The true test of this theory will be the trip to Europa (if it ever happens) because 1 milliliter of sea water can contain 250 million bacteriophages, so it will be extremely easy to tell if Europa has life (unlike Mars) and I bet $1000 that any virus-like life on Europa will contain a protein capsid and any bacteria-like life will contain a lipid layer (due to the fact that the lipid layer can actively move nutrients into the cell, just like humans can actively put food in our moves... I don't think we'd have survived if biology had trusted luck in getting food into our moves and not hands).<p>BTW A side note: The plural of virus is viruses, I don't intend to sound rude but I love the English language and the reason behind is rather complex, and no one really knows why someone tried to use virii because it isn't talking about a virus. The use of virii to denote multiple viruses appears to be an attempt by some to sound more educated by using a more Latinized plural. However, the ironic thing is that Viruses is in fact the correct pluralization for the English language. Any argument that in Latin that multiple viruses would be virii is patently false, because it's double pluralized for a male word: truly the plural of virus in latin should be virusi, vir is man in latin, so viri is men and virii is a plural of a plural! However in latin the plural of virus would likely be, virus because it's not a masculine word and plurals were exceptionally rare. It's like one cannon and two cannon, you have one virus and two virus, however the English language says two viruses to make it fit.",1236963083

I do not have immediate access to books and books are not peer reviewed. The article that I referenced above was written in 2004 – you can find more recent articles in Google Scholar if you want to. I did not see that the above article (or any of the others) have been refuted. I doubt that you can refute thousands of research articles (a lot of them recent) and a discovery that is probably the hallmark of modern psychometrics with a simple reference to a book (calling anything that you oppose “outmoded”).<p>> Stanovich is very clear on the distinction between ""intelligence"" (he is a mainstream psychologist in calling ""intelligence"" what I would simply call ""IQ"")<p>Also I think you are confusing “intelligence” with the general intelligence factor (g) (also intelligence does not equal IQ. IQ is just a standardised intelligence test that is fairly well correlated with the g factor). The general intelligence factor is a factor that is common to almost all different tests on intelligence. While the general intelligence factor is immutable other parts of intelligence can be changed by training/learning (i.e. by the environment).<p>> ""intelligence"" (he is a mainstream psychologist in calling ""intelligence"" what I would simply call ""IQ"") and ""rationality,"" an aspect of human cognition hardly tapped<p>The purpose of intelligence tests is to test intelligence – not factors such as rationality, emotion and inter-personal skills such as Stanovich's book suggest.

Fred Smith's mythical paper is the stuff of business legend. Nothing has changed here.<p>But like the article correctly states, what's changed is that entrepreneurialism has been introduced to the middle class. It's been made so easy that all those future CEO's and ladder climbers are starting to realize there is another option. High quality talent sees another way of living life - and they like it.<p>Not touched on in the article is the fact that this change in viewpoint from ""climb the corporate ladder to success"" to ""launch a business and iterate to success"" could be as revolutionary as the printing press. Think about it - the appeal of being an entrepreneur attracts the same people that would find getting an MBA and working their way up to C level positions appealing. We could - in effect - be at the very early stages of an extended ""brain drain"" of talent leaving large corporations without the leadership they need to survive. As the company finds itself less and less attractive to high-end talent, they struggle to keep up. And the spiral continues.<p>What we actually may be witnessing is the very early stages of the death of the corporation as a viable entity - all due primarily to the birth of the internet.

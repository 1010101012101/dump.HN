4981389,comment,4980131,4981077,1,0,nnq,,,"Because Fb encourages behavior that gets ""likes"" and you dont have a ""dislike"" button to compensate. Let me explain: there is a class of behaviors that get quite a lot of ""likes"" but would also get even more ""dislikes"" if there was a ""dislike"" button. But these behaviors don't get negative feedback on Fb, but instead they get encouraged, even if less than others (and ""less positive feedback"" is not the same as ""negative feedback""!). <i>This brings the worst out of some people and makes them act stupid or childish on Fb even if they are not like this in real life! (I actually observed this change to worse in myself when I was an active Fb user, but only in retrospective, after giving up Fb for a time)</i> Having a ""dislike"" button (but having it anonymously to prevent retaliation) would really change the dynamics, but it would also probably ""prune"" the network a bit, resulting in a less connected network and less engagement from each user, and I guess the Fb's ""masterminds"" thought of this and will not add such a feature because a ""pruned"" network is bad for their ""business"".<p>Fb the way it is now distorts and influences interpersonal relationships in a bad way, and this is why I use it with moderation (or mostly for business or advertising-like activities), reserving meaningful social interaction for other channels.",1356764397

The right answer to all those questions are YAGNI and KISS. :) But those answers aren't valid so the questions seem to be rigged against the candidate as in ""come up with a schema similar to the one I would have designed - not more complex than that and not more simple"". I've seen way to many situations in which developers or other persons tried to design a complete schema in which every thinkable and unthinkable instance where covered. Which leads to an incredible amount of work implementing the application that is to use that schema. The more complex the schema, the more complex everything around it has to be which exponentially increases the amount of bugs.<p>Designing applications ""schema first"" is a disastrous technique which will trigger the architecture astronauts in every developer. With your set of interview questions, you could very well miss a really skilled programmer because he or she understands that keeping stuff simple is hugely more important than not having denormalized data in the database.",1356763925

I never said it wasn't<p>> It's part of an interview process that includes an in depth review of your projects and roles, a technical screen, some design questions, et al.<p>It sounds like we agree there. The background question is essential. Behavioral questions are essential.<p>My problem is with the idea of agonizing over how you're going to spin your answers to these questions. It should just be a pretty straightforward conversation, and a fair share of the onus is on the interviewer for turning it into a conversation. If you're not willing to do that, that tells me that you, as a potential coworker or manager, are lazy and arrogant when dealing with colleagues or subordinates. Did you forget that the candidate is interviewing the company as well?<p>""What's your greatest weakness"" is a lazy and arrogant question. It's also adversarial and belligerent. To the interviewer, the question is a zero at best because you'll never get a brutally honest answer to it. To the candidate, the question is a red flag. Asking the question is never a win, and neither is answering it.<p>Finally, while I've mostly accepted in my own life that a little bit of salesmanship and negotiation is needed to get by in the world, I simply don't think it's a good <i>hiring criteria</i> for engineers. Ten times out of ten, I want a colleague who is brilliant technically and a little naive rather than a colleague who is merely competent but a great bullshitter. I think it's much more important to select for ""not an asshole"" and ""enough of a grownup to behave professionally"" than salesmanship. Crucially, this is something I try to evaluate on <i>both</i> sides of the interviewing table, and I will think you're a bit of an asshole if you ask what my greatest weakness is.",1356763874

Clay Shirky observed[1] that before the internet, all communication mediated by technology was either one-to-one (telephone, telegraph) or one-to-many (newspaper publishing). Only now with Facebook can we type up casual remarks that are instantly seen by potentially 100 or more of our real-world acquaintances. I can't think of any form of offline conversation that's analogous.<p>This is exciting to me because it suggests that how Facebook works is not the final form of online communication. There's still plenty of room to discover new forms of interaction that more closely model what humans find comfortable. Maybe the secret groups discussed in the OP (which I'd never heard of until now) are an example of that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html</a>",1356763191

So there's less expectation that your Twitter social life has to match your offline social life.<p>2. The asymmetric follow model. You can follow someone without them following you. You can unfollow someone and then change your mind and follow again without them even noticing.<p>Combined, the dynamic of Twitter is that you follow based on interest, whereas on Facebook you friend based on acquaintanceship. That produces a pressure to be interesting.<p>I'm not a particularly heavy user of either Twitter or Facebook, so please weigh in if anyone thinks I got this wrong.

I recommend going only through 2nd chapter and no further, it would be an overkill. \n      In normal life the important part is to get determined to work and get it done .The theory postulated in the 2nd chapter seems to work in the practical life effectively when Krishna tells arjuna to go on with the war and he is reluctant to do so as he finds it immoral , full of vain and dangerous to social well being of everyone. He doubts himself . The weak in his heart and unrest  sets in his mind, a common thing occurring in almost all of us . He seeks the answer to all this questions and this is what the reason of the conversation. \n  IMO the book requires considerably unbiased mind and hence its a hard read. It is not supposed to be inspiring it is supposed to work . Considering this , you wont find any magical arrangement of words so it should be taken as theory and used in practical cases . Well if it works for you then great or you can just ignore it . But surely with proper reasons of course :)",1356761865

Some of the savings will likely go into inflating the salaries of said professors to the levels of other in-demand entertainers like professional athletes or movie stars.<p>But much of the benefits will be reaped by a much larger section of society:  Lower -- and more accessible -- tuition for students (and others who help fund education like grants, scholarships and parents).<p>Some of the displaced professors whose teaching abilities don't rise to ""superstar"" level will inevitably face employment turmoil in the near term as the industry consolidates, but in the long term will likely find their talents redeployed to other tasks like research, tutoring or private-sector work.",1356761361

If a troll notices someone is female, they posy sexist things to troll her and make her react for the ""LULZ"". If she was a man, they'd troll him by calling him gay or saying racist things to him for the ""LULZ"".<p>There is an Internet MEME that ""There are no women on the Internet"" that trolls use. I think it originated on 4Chan, IIRC. It has multiple meanings. One in that it claims women in real life use the fact that they are women to get free things and benefits, and that does not work over the Internet unless she shows some nudity in a picture. Another meaning is that women on the Internet use feminist tactics for attention on how sexist men are towards them and then act unlady-like (arsehole?) towards people and then cry 'foul' when they react and reply back. Not my definition, but ones the trolls use to justify their behavior and actions towards women.<p>I was once on Kuro5hin, it was another Slashdot clone, and was striven to be like Hacker News before there was a Hacker News. The trolls got on it and scared people off of it. Yes they targeted women using sexist remarks and harassment and bullying, even called some of the women as men pretending to be women. One by one the trolls picked on and bullied the users and ganged up on users by downrating their comments and stories until they quit. The editors refused to act and the owner thought it was funny that they did that to ""people who deserved it"" and so many users left Kuro5hin and it turned into a troll site. The trolls had scripts and web robots to control the comment ratings and story voting with sock puppet accounts and directed things on IRC. I was asked to join them one time and I refused, so I was made a target. Eventually I was no longer at that web site either. Yes I spoke out against the trolls and protested only to have my account deleted/anonymized so my account no longer worked. They put up a $5 paywall to keep the trolls away, but it seems the trolls don't mind paying for new accounts after they burn their old ones. I've never seen a technology or policy that effectively deals with trolls yet.",1356761268

Marisa Mayer is the CEO of Yahoo. Meg Whitman runs HP. I work on a team of ridiculously talented software engineers, many of whom are women. Several books I've read to learn how to program were written by women. There are many women who have been tremendously successful and influential in tech.<p>With regard to women's rights and attitudes towards women,  we've come a long way, and undoubtedly have further to go.

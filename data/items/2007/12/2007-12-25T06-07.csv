My family celebrated christmas at this time of year when I was younger. I still feel like having a happy holiday right around now, but I don't connect with any of the Jesus stuff.  Thanks to the original poster for wishing me a happy non-christmas-holiday-that-I-celebrate-around-the-same-time-as-christmas (on mine, I get to argue with people on the Internet!).<p>I feel your point has been thoroughly dismissed now. Happy holidays anyway!",1198565933

92563,comment,92516,92530,0,0,dzorz,,,"I really don't think that is the reason. Where I grew up 99% schools had two shifts, and sometimes even three shifts. Boys and girls were not separated, although my country is one of those where >80% peple are christian.<p>Our school day was up to six hours long (7 school hours (45 min each) + 5 min breaks in between). We received generally the same quality education as many other Central/Eastern European countries. Btw., the reason schools introduce extra shifts is to be able to accomodate more pupils in same classrooms.<p>Merry Christmas!",1198564305

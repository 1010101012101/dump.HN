I think the issue is that the early preloads filled the queue, preventing the stores from happening.

For someone who lacks the perspective of a seasoned programmer, I am routinely blown away by how easily you can incorporate .NET libraries to do cool stuff. One example - Microsoft has a standard speech recognition library, which works well for constrained grammar. As such, a desktop app with voice recognition was very easy to do.<p>For a variety of reasons, prior attempts at C++, Ruby, PHP never took hold for me. The main reason was I had no compelling project to complete (I have a few now, related to work). Yet, looking back on these episodes, and the experienced programmers will surely laugh, but getting a basic environment up where you can write code, build and deploy is difficult for the uninitiated, if you start on Windows as I did.<p>Later, with a mac, I did the first 1/3 of the one-month-rails course, which actually saw me through to creating a working ruby environment. There&#x27;s lots of domain expertise which makes ruby inaccessible to the newb, not the least of which is that the most common IDE is a glorified text editor.

Allowing a public, universal, nearly unique identifier (apparently SSN&#x27;s aren&#x27;t always unique) for every resident of the US might make it easier to compile, buy, and sell information about people.  I guess these companies already use {name, date of birth} as an ID to attach addresses etc., but having a more robust UID would allow more accuracy when considering name changes or variants.  Also, publicizing SSN&#x27;s risks retroactively publicizing everything that was ever privately collected under them.  I can&#x27;t quite put my thumb on this, so maybe it&#x27;s a bit irrational, but I would want somebody to thoroughly disprove things like this before I could support the idea.<p>If, e.g., Facebook is completely allowed to know my SSN, they can more easily make deals with anyone else to share information about my finances, medicine, voting, etc., which are already tied to my SSN.  Considering the &quot;shadow profiles&quot; some social companies reportedly compile, they might even be able to do this without my ever creating an account.  The current situation in this area would still probably make me uncomfortable if I knew it all (as your links suggest, Facebook might already be able to guess a lot of SSN&#x27;s), but I at least hope that having one &quot;secret&quot; and legally &quot;regulated&quot; element slows down some data mining and exchanging.<p>If you have confidence that business interests or laws will prevent my worst fears from being realized, consider we&#x27;re talking about this in a thread about supposedly private information being publicly released when a company got hacked.

While I know lots of stuff about Mac and Windows, it&#x27;s quite common that I don&#x27;t have a clue about anything else that that program requires, other than the core OS and standard library calls.<p>The way it commonly works is that I&#x27;ll apply for a consulting gig.  If I&#x27;m asked to interview, I&#x27;ll buy the required book after I have agreed to interview, but before the interview takes place.  That means I only have a few days to read the book.<p>You&#x27;d think that would not work but actually it works just fine.<p>What does not work at all is when someone wants to know how many years of experience I already have with a given technology.  &quot;None at all, but I can buy an O&#x27;Reilly book for just thirty bucks.&quot;",1418000531

It&#x27;s one thing for channels that build their viewer base from free viewers and then later have something like Patreon with an optional subscription to fund them, but quite another for them to go paid only.<p>And how much would people pay? Satellite TV starts at €30/mo here. In light of that, even paying €5/mo or €1/video for one channel would be a poor value proposition for many people.",1418000416

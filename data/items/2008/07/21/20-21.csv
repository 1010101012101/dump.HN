252654,comment,252627,252627,0,0,sutro,,,"How about programming languages as women?<p>I met this little girl named Logo when I was just a boy. I have no idea what she's doing these days, but I still think about her. She was my first romance.<p>I took BASIC to a dance in middle school. I was so clueless about how to talk to her that more often than not I would have to quote magazines verbatim as a way of communicating. As a result she never respected me and I never felt comfortable around her. We broke up after the dance.<p>I didn't really date in high school.<p>Pascal was my college girlfriend. At first I couldn't believe she was so scantily clad -- where were her line numbers? We had a brief torrid affair. When I got a chess simulation to compile on my first try I thought that maybe I should major in CS to spend more time with her, but ended up studying other subjects and got involved with completely different kinds of women.<p>After a circuitous way back to programming, I ended up involved in an office affair with a coworker named C. I worked as hard as I could to prove myself worthy of her but she seemed so cold. I never really knew what she thought of me. Our relationship taught me a lot, though.<p>When trying to complete a masters in CS I got involved with a woman named C++. It was a dark, confusing time. She was crazy. I always suspected she was abusing drugs, and cheating on me with one of my professors.<p>I finally settled down and got married to Java. We've been through so many ups and downs together it's hard to imagine life without her, although I must admit that my eye has been wondering lately. Some really hot women have been flirting with me and sorely testing my fidelity. I don't consider myself the cheating type, but it's all I think about sometimes. Maybe I'm having a mid-life crisis.",1216672670

252650,comment,252546,252613,0,0,ajross,,,"Amen.  Any discussion of code style (symbol naming, whitespace conventions, braces, whatever) that is based on an argument about how long it takes to <i>type</i> the code is just wrong.  A good typist can write thousands of lines of code an hour at least.  That is so far below the development speed of even the best hacker as to be pure noise.<p>There's a mild case for different code styles from a readability perspective, I guess.  But arguing for (e.g.) case insensitive symbol names because the it takes too long to reach the shift key is just insane.  But regardless: code readability is 90% a function of organization, not style.  I will always prefer to work on well-organized code in mixed styles (or languages) than spaghetti code that adheres strictly to an elaborate style convention.",1216672487

The HTML is now the model, not the view.<p>This does not solve the labor division problem you describe, rater it turns it into a completely different problem.

252632,comment,252185,252217,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"Another option: get a language where markup itself is first-class syntax. JavaScript with E4X has XML built-in, which of course means XHTML if you like, which itself can be trivially translated to HTML if you prefer (as I do).<p>So just like regular expressions have first-class syntax, i.e., in JavaScript you can write either of:<p><pre><code>  myRx = /somePattern/g;\n  myRx = new RegExp('somePattern','g');\n</code></pre>\nSo with E4X you can write either of:<p><pre><code>  greeting = <b>Hello, {user.name}!</b>;\n  greeting = new XML(""<b>Hello, ""+user.name+""!</b>"");\n</code></pre>\nThough those really aren't equivalent since the second might be a XSS vulnerability, whereas the first is automatically escaped.<p>E4X only works in Mozilla-based browsers, but it also works just fine in Rhino, so you can use it in Helma (<a href=""http://helma.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://helma.org/</a>) or any of the other Rhino-based frameworks or in Jaxer (<a href=""http://aptana.com/jaxer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aptana.com/jaxer</a>).",1216670993

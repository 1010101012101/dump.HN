Previous major waves of technical innovation were lead by well established Americans.  Something has changed.<p>A plausible hypothesis (not that I'm convinced) is that high immigration has driven down wages in technical professions.  So native born Americans are less inclined to bother.<p>I think it's important to point out that two American eras of high growth and prosperity had essentially zero immigration.

I assure you that few experienced angel investors would have been upset or surprised that the college kids they gave $200K to produced code that was messy or had some bad security problems in the early stages.  They would be a lot more concerned with how the founders planned on getting adoption for their fledgling service, or whether they were iterating on the product quickly enough.

Compare that to a guy that takes a class on some esoteric aspect of coding, when he/she doesn't have any need to apply it, when they just care about getting a good grade - which person really has learned the material? Does the person that already learned it but didn't need it at the time have a really big advantage? They might work through the problem faster, so maybe that's the advantage - you save some time.<p>But I like the root of your point - one doesn't grow/learn without trying to hit their own limits and push past them.

I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for ""bling"" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations.

Individual marriages have either a 100% or 0% chance of success, and calculating the probability of those outcomes is not greatly informed by the ""national average.""</i><p>Not true at all.<p>The subjective probability (which is all you have to make a decision from) is reflected by incomplete information, but is never 100%.<p>But even the objective probability (as far as such a concept is even coherent) isn't either 0 or 100. It's somewhere in between. Maybe under one set of circumstances the marriage will work out perfectly, but under another set of circumstances it won't. That's random. In one possible world the husband could arrive home at 5:12 and find his wife with another man, in another possible world he arrives home at 5:17 to find his wife freshly showered. That's random, or at least stochastic enough. In one possible world a stray gamma ray gives their child leukemia and the couple grow closer by going through the experience together, in another possible world no such thing happens, the husband goes back to work shortly after the child is born and slowly becomes alienated from his wife until divorce happens. Think you have a good enough marriage that adultery or alienation aren't going to become problems? Well throw in the multitude of circumstances which can cause people to change over time, and you'll find random factors there, too.",1284757600

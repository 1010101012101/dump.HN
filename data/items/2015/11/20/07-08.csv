What portion of your typical day would you honestly say is devoted to solid, in-the-flow work?  After all the meeting, context switches, random interruptions, lunch, distractions on company chat -- I personally would say a fraction.  Or flow state is simply dead for me at the office.<p>Recently, my roommate and I came home after work and ended up knocking out a very useful skunkworks project in about 6 hours over the course of 2 nights.  That completely uninterrupted time mixed with the fact that it was a project that was freshly conceived and still full of passion in our minds let us get more work done in that burst than we felt like we had in weeks.<p>20% time is a joke.  We need to ditch this 40 hour, strictly scheduled workweek in distracting office environments and try some radically different ways of getting productivity boosts.  It just so happens that people also feel a lot better when they get these boosts to boot.  I know after knocking out that project certainly made me feel awesome.",1448006229

I also do not know what the correct interpretation is, though it is becoming increasingly clear that I should probably learn.<p>I think we have been arguing at cross-purposes.

Consider this: You have all people tied up in work for one month. A customer issue comes up. Who should step up to take it? Because you&#x27;re not seriously suggesting it should rot there one month, do you?<p>It&#x27;s a classical coordination problem (and that&#x27;s why preemptive scheduling was invented). I, as a developer, have no idea if I should step up. I would have to asses importance of all the other work that is being done by others, just to get a boolean value out of it. So everybody has to switch context to examine the issue, and the everybody&#x27;s tasks to see where it fits in the grand scheme of things.<p>Now you can say, OK, we will have priorities on things, easy. But then you actually find out that the low priority work doesn&#x27;t get done at all. OK, so you start to calculate time slices, fair scheduling, all that jazz. And all of sudden everybody is forced to execute these overcomplicated scheduling algorithms and no real work gets done. It&#x27;s a bureaucratic nightmare (because people are really bad at executing algorithms correctly, and have high task switching overhead), and I have seen it. While this could be sanely done by a single responsible person, project manager, who has an idea about:<p>(1) what is the priority (and required latency) of each work item<p>(2) how long things are going to take (estimate)<p>(3) what are the dependencies<p>(4) who prefers what kind of work<p>Furthermore, if he needs any help with these points, he doesn&#x27;t need to ask the whole team.

10600130,comment,10593011,10599999,0,0,yeukhon,,,"The introductory could be done better, I agree. I think a full tutorial with code sample + lab account will help people to accelerate (I am slowly building up some code sample myself to train people internally). I suggest to AWS they need to slow down on making new products, and instead focus on enhancing the existing products. Some of the products lack of critical features, and in some cases their APIs are not complete. TODO TODO. Kind of embarrassing.<p>I can understand why they don&#x27;t do that. Several reasons, 1) they assume people who are looking to build infrastructure in their cloud platform have some experience, if not, extensive experience with operation and building infrastructure. Second, there is a whole support model they sell. Lastly, they have partners to do training. IMO, AWS has done good job presenting intro materials to experienced operation folks in their reInvent videos.<p>I can go on to defend why I think the entry barrier exists, or how AWS can do better. Here is my only tip to any new AWS customers: your mileage is different so don&#x27; start plugging in a dozen AWS native services into your architecture just because everyone is using it. Start simple. In our case, we are forced to use two ELBs in front of our nginx and our router service, which eventually routes the requests to our app server. That&#x27;s a lot of web servers passing traffic. There should be a native offering of Nginx and Apache IMO. ELB is garbage (I say this with a love and hate passion) if you want to replace Nginx / Apache entirely. Anyway, IMO, the major take away of building a cloud infrastructure is &quot;instance is cheap to recycle [if you have the right tool].&quot;<p>> This is where DigitalOcean and Vultr are profiting the most - publishing tutorials,<p>Are you referring to <a href=""https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/</a> ? I find them useful, but some of the community tutorials are suggesting (maybe just me) wrong approach. I don&#x27;t think DO is the first one, I remember browsing Linode content quite often back in the days.<p>Anyway, I think the gap is filled by developing a PaaS such as Herkou, on top of IaaS (AWS, GCE, Azure).

In the latter case, isn&#x27;t it better to have someone who&#x27;s interested doing it than have that person doing uninteresting work while an uninterested person heads up the project?",1448003603

Not saying you are wrong at all, just have different perspective :)<p>1. When I say &quot;global state&quot; I mean the actual state, actions and signals are state changers, not state. A global state store looks like this:<p>{\n  admin: {\n    users: [],\n    showConfig: false\n  },\n  home: {\n    isLoadingNotifications: false,\n    notifications: []\n  }\n}<p>This is one file. If you use local state this example would be split into maybe 3 different files. I think we both agree it has to do with how many files you need to look into. And the amount of composition you need to do in your head.<p>2. It would be interesting to see Om Next in JavaScript syntax, too much brainpower going into trying to read Clojure :) Not because it is bad, just have not learned it<p>3. That is true, but now it is conceptually no different than signals/actions and for that very reason. You should look into a different file to read the state change. I think it is a good thing. State changes are often very complex, surprisingly complex. They should not be inside a component. I think a component should only be about rendering UI. State changes should be expressed by a different layer.<p>So what I think is interesting here is that we seem to look at the app from two completely opposite sides. I do not care about the components to understand my app, because they just express its output, the UI. My app is really the state defined and the way it changes that state. What I do care about though is having dumb components is that makes me able to do universal apps, just move my app to a new UI output like react-native etc.<p>It will be really interesting to see how Om Next affects the JavaScript community. We are good at getting ideas from other languages and practices, where Elm is a good example :)<p>Again, not stating that you are wrong about anything. It is nice to go into a component and understand how that component works. Its just in my experience really bad to use a &quot;view&quot; as a container for state and business logic. That said it is really important to be open minded and I hope to see us grab ideas from Om Next. Actually trying to inspire creator of Baobab to bring in some new ideas :-)",1448003369

I&#x27;m currently on a very activist college campus and also have many friends (and follow many people on Twitter) who side with this movement. To an extent, I&#x27;m sympathetic to the difficulty of actually being heard. There was an open letter recently from one student activism group that said that they would not protest &quot;respectfully&quot; because they feel that that is just another way for their voices to be suppressed, or some such.<p>That&#x27;s a hard problem. It does seem like there has been a lot of talk and not a lot of walk from the people/institutions that hold power, and if I were on the activism side, I&#x27;d also be extremely frustrated.

In reaction to social science studies that show that, say, African-Americans are systematically disenfranchised in the country, some conservatives attack social science itself, saying that it is inherently leftist, or biased in some way, the methodology is wrong, it&#x27;s not a real science, etc. Similarly, some activists, like you said, would respond to the appeals to free inquiry and free expression by attacking the &#x27;holiness&#x27; of free inquiry and free expression. Certainly possible that that&#x27;s all a fraud to elevate those in power, but they seem pretty self-evident to me, not the least because free expression and inquiry, on the whole, seem to benefit the minority rather than those in power IMO.",1448002806

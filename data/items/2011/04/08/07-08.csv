You've either gotta keep the carrier frequency down low enough to let it bend around the earth - which limits the bandwidth you can transmit, accept the vagaries of shortwave radio transmission - which doesn't seem to be what you'd need for HFT applications, or lose the several hundred milliseconds it takes to get to geo-sync orbit and back _twice_ - which would lose out speed wise to anybody on the ground at either end who only needs to get his signal up to orbit and back once.<p>I don't see how radio helps much?<p>(perhaps a string of line-of-sight high frequency repeating stations? At a first approximation assuming 100m (330') tall towers you get ~36km to the horizon, so you'd need ~150 towers with repeaters on them to cover the ~5500km from London to New York. I guess that's not _impossible_, but even if you could stack up the infrastructure required, the latency in those ~150 repeaters would need to be very small to beat the guy sending his data through the fibre on the sea floor with a theoretical ~20ms ping time, and a quickly googled practical pingtime of ~100ms. The radio options still requires the ~20ms speed-of-light propagation time, but needs to get the signal through ~150 repeaters as well, compared to just the one on each end of the fibers (I _think_ the optical repeater/amps used on oceanic fibers are zero latency...)",1302247270

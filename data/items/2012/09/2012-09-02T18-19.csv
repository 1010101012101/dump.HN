As an example of the trouble you can get into with p-values see recent discussion over misreporting of the LHC experiments (a good starting point is <a href=""http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/07/11/the-higgs-boson-and-the-p-value-police/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/07/11/the-higgs-boso...</a>). Every time I see p-values reported in A/B tests I get leery -- people are trying to adopt a scientific mindset but the tools are leading them astray. (Disclosure: I work on an A/B testing product, called Myna [mynaweb.com] that adopts a different approach.)<p>The other point I particularly like is the discussion on mean values and robust statistics. Most analytics packages just report means, losing so much information in the process. Again I bet many bad decisions are made due to poor tools.",1346612389

Wesburo Baptist Church for example, I've never heard anything about their members being democrats, though I would query that claim given they aren't a political group, so even if some of them are, likely not all of them... not to mention Wikipedia tells me their general opinion is that Obama is going to hell for being ""the antichrist"".<p>End of the day I've heard plenty of data points for Republican wackos, and few for Democrat ones, so that's where my opinion comes from.

I was surprised to discover that even the old technique of matching fingerprints is still the subject of a lot of recent scholarly studies<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=fingerprint+matching+validation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=fingerprint+matching+val...</a><p><a href=""https://uchastings.edu/hlj/archive/vol59/Koehler_59-HLJ-1077.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://uchastings.edu/hlj/archive/vol59/Koehler_59-HLJ-1077...</a><p>and that there is NOT full validation of all the techniques that have long been used to show fingerprint matches between criminal case suspects and fingerprint impressions found at a crime scene. The article submitted here makes the important point even the latest gee-whiz technology, DNA typing, which is usually the key to solving crimes on television drama shows, has significant limitations. Sometimes DNA samples are poorly gathered, and sometimes DNA test results are ambiguous.<p>It takes a combination of multiple lines of evidence that are consistent with one another best to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Lawyers for criminal defendants do the right thing when they argue vigorously over every factual basis for the state's claim that an accused defendant is guilty. I was an appellate clerk once upon a time for a state supreme court that reviewed all first-degree murder convictions in the state. I had to read a lot of case files with gory crime scene photographs and lots of transcripts of witness testimony to events and expert witness testimony about the findings of scientific tests. Sometimes a case is supported by so many lines of evidence that no reasonable appellate judge could doubt the sufficiency of the evidence shown at trial. Other times a conviction at trial is reversed on appeal not because of factual innocence, but because of legal errors by the prosecution. But every once in a while, even after a conviction at trial under the standard of presuming innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, a very reasonable doubt that wasn't considered fully at trial is preserved in the court record and forms the basis of reversing the trial court judgment on appeal. No one line of evidence is foolproof, not even DNA.",1346611995

Most of it has already been proven to be pseudoscience or else is on its way to being proven so. And of the stuff that actually is at least potentially legit, like DNA testing, virtually all of the labs in the US are so poorly run that their results wouldn't even be admissible as evidence, let alone considered reliable, if more people actually knew what was going on there. If I remember correctly the last time the US government did an audit of its accredited forensics labs every single one failed, and the vast majority aren't even accredited to begin with.<p>Relevant links:<p><a href=""http://www.alternet.org/print/story/147613/has_the_most_common_marijuana_test_resulted_in_tens_of_thousands_of_wrongful_convictions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/print/story/147613/has_the_most_comm...</a><p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_grann?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_...</a><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/magazine/dna-evidence-lake-county.html?_r=2&ref=magazine&adxnnlx=1322497624-TcXf3srEhTm8YyMhyeuvpQ&pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/magazine/dna-evidence-lake...</a><p><a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/21/the-mind-of-a-police-dog/singlepage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/21/the-mind-of-a-police-d...</a><p><a href=""http://www.erowid.org/freedom/police/police_article1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erowid.org/freedom/police/police_article1.shtml</a><p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/criminal-justice/real-csi/can-unconscious-bias-undermine-fingerprint-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/criminal-justice/rea...</a>",1346611292

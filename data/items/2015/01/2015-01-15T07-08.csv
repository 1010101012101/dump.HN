There were multiple offices involved in doing all the paperwork involved (in a multi-story building, too).  The school was located in an area where the household income was around $25k per year, and many people worked at the minimum wage.  It seemed absurd to me that they had to jump through so many hoops to get a few hundred dollars of aid.",1421308563
8891387,comment,8890952,8890952,0,0,Fede_V,,,"Ehh, I thought I was negative about Italy, but seeing what everyone else is saying, I&#x27;m probably the most positive person here.<p>The pros:<p>- There are some absolutely excellent open source developers who can be hired much more cheaply than the US.<p>- Life is excellent.  Italy is a really beautiful country.<p>- Lots of incredibly low hanging fruits.  Italy has a lot of great companies that makes excellent products the entire world wants, but have absolutely pathetic IT departments.  This is also true in the public sector - several regions of Italy have amazing touristic attractions with pathetic marketing/web presence.  This is probably the best reason.<p>The cons:<p>- As a corollary to the last pro (about low hanging fruits).  Public sector contracts are given to people who are completely incompetent but well connected, who then sub contract it out.  The technocratic/political class, especially at the local level, is almost always old, and has gotten their positions because of connections.<p>- Moreso than outright corruption (unless you live in the South), red tape can be a massive issue.<p>- This does not affect start ups, but once you grow to more than 15 employees, staff hired full time is basically impossible to fire.  This is very slowly getting changed.<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to move to Italy if you want to work on the next chat/social media application, but if you have a great idea on how to use web to improve tourism/market high end goods, or you have excellent SaaS software for medium-large sized companies, you could probably do very well, and live very well too.<p>Basically, this is sort of an interesting (but old) summary of an interesting case study: <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121969807244970447"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121969807244970447</a> - there were lots of resources, lots of low hanging fruits, and yet due to political squabbling, total ignorance of technology and nepotism the project was a huge waste.  Given how low the bar is, it&#x27;s very possible to do much better.<p>Small edit:
There is a huge generational gap between the 50+ year olds that run the country, and the kids graduating now from University, in terms of attitude towards technology, meritocracy, and entrepreneurship.",1421308532

8891381,comment,8886164,8887351,0,0,entropydude,,,"I&#x27;m a doctor and former software programmer, so let me offer a counterpoint:<p>I would disagree with your statement that medical people have a fatalistic passive attitude.  In this case the decision is between 1) watching and waiting to see if the tumor grows and 2) acting immediately to take it out.  The tumor in question is a meningioma, a relatively common tumor of the skull (meninges, to be precise) whose natural behavior is unpredictable (some are essentially benign, others are highly malignant).  Sometimes high-risk features can be identified on MRI imaging (brain invasion, areas of tissue necrosis, rapid growth) and these will always be treated with intervention.  I work at UCSF, one of the top neurosurgery programs in the world, and I can guarantee you the radiologists don&#x27;t make the mistake on sizing tumors mentioned here (well maybe they do, but it is out of carelessness rather than a problem with there software. it is not hard to find anatomic landmarks to ensure you are measuring at the same level).   I would argue that a small meningioma without worrisome features should definitely not be operated on because the risks of  surgery are not negligible!  These surgeries are no joke, they are extraordinarily complex and they are mucking around next to structures which can cause significant morbidity, neurologic deficits, and even death sometimes if they nick the wrong artery.<p>It is well accepted practice and backed by evidence (see the WHO:tumors of the CNS publication) that the best way to decrease overall morbidity is by watching and waiting with these types of meningiomas. This is because MOST meningiomas are low-risk/benign (they are often found incidentally during autopsies for other reasons) and the risk of adverse surgical outcomes would be high if you subjected each of these people to invasive procedures when the incidence of high grade meningiomas is low.  It is a population based strategy and unfortunately on an individual level you can&#x27;t predict the outcome, but that is unfortunately a problem with this data.  Fortunately lots of new technologies are emerging that can tease out individual differences (the so-called personalized medicine technologies)<p>That being said the new techniques to map out anatomy to aid surgeons is very cool!  And to be fair, it sounds like the patient in this article did not get great care and that some of the doctors were not following the standard of care (1 year between imaging is definitely too long).",1421308446

8891362,comment,8886842,8890497,0,0,__david__,,,"Of course you can do things like macros, but it&#x27;s ugly and becomes unreadable the more you add to the code. Structure initializers grow and expand more gracefully than anything c++ has.<p>What does this line do?<p><pre><code>    Widget *w = new Button(&quot;Press me&quot;, true, true, false, 0, 0, 0, NULL, callback, 10);
</code></pre>
Yes, you can fix that by defining special true/false enums for each of the options, or you can do something reasonable:<p><pre><code>    struct Button b = { .title=&quot;Press Me&quot;, .enabled=true,
                        .visible=true, .expand=false
                        .x=0, .y=0, .width=10, .z_index=0,
                        .handler=callback };
</code></pre>
I love the array ones, but they&#x27;re most useful for static look-up tables, and those are usually size constrained:<p><pre><code>    void (*command[256])() = { [&#x27;H&#x27;] = command_help,
                               [&#x27;S&#x27;] = command_start
                               [&#x27;s&#x27;] = command_stop };
</code></pre>
I like that a lot but I definitely use it less than the structure initializers.<p>I hear people tout default values as a real important feature, but I&#x27;ve worked on large projects where backward compatibility was important, and it was almost always possible to encode the value in such a way that zero meant &quot;default&quot;. This allows you to add new members to structures easily and anyone that doesn&#x27;t set them gets the default value. It may sound hokey but it works <i>extremely</i> well in practice. I never once wished for default values when I was doing large C99 projects.",1421307903

8891327,comment,8890952,8890952,0,0,jnardiello,,,"# Sorry LONG comment and need to go to work, little to no time to read again and fix errors. Be kind.<p>I&#x27;m yet another italian (expat to London) and let me state a few things which are not listed on that landing page but that you should consider before applying:<p>I&#x27;ve worked for a few months in a &quot;startup&quot; inside a major italian incubator (Working Capital). I was developer #1 of the company, and here are a few things I want to tell you about incubators in Italy: 1) The level of mentorship provided is close to zero. Their main role is &quot;office&quot; surveillance. They will contribute with ZERO competence to your startup as they have no valuable experience.  2) There are two kind of companies inside incubators: those &quot;with connections&quot; and those without. Companies without connections were accepted just so that the incubator has some numbers to show off. Those with connections (which is most likely due to the parents of the founders being friend with some excutive in the incubator partners) will receive enough support, will behave without a code of conduct, will make it through the whole process without a flaw while If your company will be on the &quot;no connections&quot; side expect (and I will state this again) to be simply abandoned.  3) Investors, pitches and demo days: they mostly are a bunch of executives from partnering companies who have close to zero experience in investing and who gives zero shit about startups. Again, they will just hangout events because of political connections with incubators and as soon as pitches are over they will leave the presentation flying. Execting any kind of feedback nor real investment is just nonsense. I never saw ANY company in an incubator getting anything from official investors. This is still true if you are a random startup without connection. If you are one with connections, you won&#x27;t attend demo-day, you won&#x27;t be doing spitches and you&#x27;ll be funded anyway.  4) In general the startups level is mediocre to say the best. As the selection process is quite random (remember: you are there so that they can say they are an incubator and get money from the public administration) most of the ideas are just completely random and founder have ZERO technical background. In the incubator I used to work, I was the only developer (and we are talking about 40+ people in the room). Believe it or not.  5) Getting investments won&#x27;t be easy. Which doesn&#x27;t mean that if you work hard enough you can still achieve results. It means that nobody wants to invest, there&#x27;s no investments culture on the investor side and no support from so-called incubators. I saw probably 1-2 companies getting any sort of funding and they took years of &quot;working for free&quot; to get a 250k investment.<p>So, this is pretty much what you should expect when bootstrapping a company in Italy inside an incubator. Of course this is bureaucratic and tax-related problems aside (which are quite difficult to sort: you should expect to throw tens of thousands of euros to get your company officially started and keep your books in order. These costs will probably exceed any funding you&#x27;ll get).<p>A few more things to consider:
1) The italian culture is business-adverse. Average People aim in life is to find a stable job in a big-size company/public administration until pension. As a startupper you&#x27;ll be mostly seen as a young unemployed wasting his time.
2) If you are REALLY talented and lucky, you build up the &quot;right connections&quot;, get yourself funded and open a profitable company you will likely have to deal with mafia (as someone already mentioned). First hand experience: my uncle bootstrapped a profitable fish-import company. Mafia knocked, asked them to acquire the business paying close-to-zero. At the beginning my uncle refused: His car and house catched fire. Of course institutions did nothing about this. He sold the company and left the country. No jokes here.<p>So, I could probably go on but I hope you got the point :) Should you apply? It depends I guess from where you are right now. If you want to launch a business in Europe and don&#x27;t know where to start: then maybe you could apply to be accepted in Italy BUT then you need to have a plan to move either to London or to Berlin. If you think to move to Italy and find a healthy business-oriented environment: you are SO wrong.<p>Good luck!",1421306940

Printing money causes inflation under all cases unless money is literally destroyed at the same rate it is printed.<p>A loan temporarily inflates the economy until it is paid off. By replacing credit with printed money you turn the &quot;temporary inflation&quot; into permanent inflation.<p>2. &quot;Increase your productivity faster then your income.&quot; --
Are you kidding me? I can&#x27;t speak for everyone but most people in society want to be rich and well off. That means achieving income that is far greater then what is humanly productive. Even Elon Musk as hard working as he is cannot achieve his level of income off of his own productivity alone. He had to build his wealth off the shoulders of others (aka employees). By telling people to be productive for less income he&#x27;s basically telling people to work harder and don&#x27;t ask for a raise.<p>If you&#x27;re not being paid an income equivalent to the amount of work you do, then the extra value generated by your work will, of course, go to your employer. This increases income disparity and decreases consumer buying power.<p>Here&#x27;s what I advise instead: Increase your productivity but demand that your income increases at the same rate. Be paid what you&#x27;re worth. It helps the economy.<p>3. He fails to elucidate where income comes from and thus fails to model one very important aspect of the economy: The money cycle. The economy isn&#x27;t just income coming out of thin air to facilitate transactions of product and services. Money moves in a cycle, it flows from employer to employee as wages then back to the employer when the employee pays for products. The total amount of money cycling through the economy would otherwise be fixed if it wasn&#x27;t for loans and money printing.",1421306832

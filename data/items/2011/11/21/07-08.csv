3260393,comment,3260063,3260063,7,0,calydon,,,"Peter Watts became the living master of hard scifi, (imo), with ""Blindsight"". In that book he first described (in terms that someone like me could understand) a cognition that rivals and surpasses human intelligence, by an alien creature that is 'unconscious'. It's so counter-intuitive to human thought (and arrogance) that something can be autonomous (unaware of its own actions) yet still work with purpose and according to a strategy that benefits its interests. Because the systems that are needed to maintain awareness are not present, this is in fact a faster and less error-prone method of thinking. \nHe also does a neat trick where the aliens can communicate with us, despite having no understanding of what they are saying. I would have to re-read that part of the book to offer an explanation, but it involves grammar and information theory.<p>I would like to know, is this study of crypto-intelligence a recognized field and is Peter Watts at the forefront of this study, or is he getting his ideas from a disconnected body of experts?",1321862284

The theoretical difficulty of pop-economics books like Hayek's Economics In One Lesson or The Road to Serfdom is less than Teach Yourself Programming In 24 Hours. That's not meant as a slight on any of those books or their authors, but your comparison is so inapt it beggars belief. The mathematical prerequisites alone for reading TAOCP are so significant that Knuth had to write an advanced undergraduate and graduate-level textbook (Concrete Mathematics) to equip students with even a small subset of the tools required.",1321862166

Every virus-like behavior I've seen over the past several years was actually anti-malware misbehaving.  One particular peeve is disk usage - anti-virus scans at a low priority, but somehow the disk slows to a crawl anyway.  I suspect that the antivirus gets fewer I/O requests serviced, but causes many seeks so once it gets an I/O request honored, the disk is tied up until the seek completes.  It would be nice if the OS took care of this, but given that it doesn't, I blame the anti-malware vendors for not caring about their customers.",1321862031

Proving the correctness of a word processor has almost nothing to do with the design of its functionality. What should a word processor do? The answer to that question is not math. Does this piece of code do what this written specification says it should do? The answer to that question can be produced by math. Software is at least both of these things. It certainly is not math alone.<p>> You just lack the tools and understanding for it, and it can get very complex, very quickly<p>That's an ad hominen in front of an irrelevant statement. The Church-Turing thesis is indeed proven. A simple statement of that thesis goes: ""Everything algorithmically computable is computable by a Turing machine. Some things are not thus computable."" This idea along its proof, is one of the finest human achievements of the twentieth century. But it sure doesn't tell you how to write a word processor. It tells you that the word processor you wrote could be run on any of a family of equivalent machines, and that it can't compute certain things. That's deep and lovely indeed. Since that proof was created, we knew that Visicalc, Word, TeX and Bit Torrent existed in the space of possible programs, and by implication we knew a lot about their properties. Somebody still had to design and write the fuckers, and they were not doing math when they did so. They were engineering software.<p>Another completely different angle: If you admit that ""The Mythical Man Month"" was any kind of contribution to software, can you explain its contribution to mathematics?<p>> You just lack the tools and understanding for it, and it can get very complex<p>I think I'll put this on a t-shirt.

Although often you need to take into account some non-obvious stuff when you compare two amounts of money (esp. prices), it still does work.<p>For inherent value each person would see their own price tag. And I'm sure my tag would reflect smaller amount for Jane Austen's book than yours.<p>And feet-voting is good if you can judge on a large scale, which is not always applicable. Edit: by the way, most people would feet-vote for a big mac rather than a book (that is, if we were able to conduct a really unbiased experiment with random selection of people).",1321859954

Problems tend to move around in circles and pointing out an issue is a good way to have it boomerang back to where it becomes yours to solve.<p>It's much better if you have coworkers and especially management with whom you can cooperate.  If there's at least enough flexibility to improve things, it's possible to have things snowball in reverse, as it were, where each person tackles a piece of the problem and it gets taken care of.<p>But it's hard if you work with people who don't care.  For example, it can be frustrating to get blamed for causing problems that have always existed, with no one noticing them, simply because people were too far away from the consequences and those who suffered the consequences had no idea about their cause.<p>And yes, even simple things like ""source control"" can be a tough sell when the devs insist that keeping the .c file in the folder with the .exe counts as source control.  For a nearly 30-year-old DOS program, written with ASCII menus (think printf, not ncurses), uses only statically assigned globals (malloc?  what's that do?), deeeeply nested ifs, that directly writes outputs to hardware I'm not sure anyone at the company still understands, and there's a custom build for each install?  I'm just grateful I have nothing to do with ""maintaining"" that source and that DOS makes it easy to do backups via xcopy and a network drive.  In retrospect, I might have been happier not knowing what was in those .c files.",1321859946

3260306,comment,3260012,3260012,27,0,nhashem,,,"A couple years ago, when I was at a previous employer, I was lamenting the typical corporate frustrations to a friend.  The executives seemed to have a new ""strategy"" every quarter.  All our projects had unrealistically given deadlines.  Even when we successfully released a new product, it was basically DOA, because they were never things we would use ourselves.  It was basically impossible to pivot our aging flagship product, because it has grown so complex that it was impossible to get any more incremental gains without a huge commitment in resources.  At least once a month I'd be asked, ""Well can we make this change to the product quickly?"" and I would always say, ""No.  There are no quick changes anymore.  You can either commit the staff to getting the product back into a state where we can do quick changes again (ie. refactoring some of it), or you can just put the product in maintenance mode and have the staff do something else.""  And yet no matter how many times I explained why, using as many MBA-friendly concepts and analogies as possible, they never understood.<p>My friend asked if any of the executives and managers had an engineering background, and I literally laughed out loud.  Of course they didn't.  If they did, they would have understood concepts in this article.  Instead they were exactly like that political douchebag in The Wire video.<p>One of my greatest hopes for the current proliferation of startups is that some of the technical talent there actually does end up as leaders corporate America.  I see the fundamental problem of corporations led by execs with the classic MBA-educated, McKinsey/Bain-trained background is they've never created or produced a damn thing in their lives, and just fundamentally don't understand why their decisions are so dysfunctional.",1321859483

For example, for something like logging or pre-flight checks the exact timing would matter that much, and it would be convenient to have a full blown OS. When timing matters (e.g. flight control?), I imagine that one could set up controllers (with their own CPUs and straight to the metal programming of the sort you described) as devices that accept commands from and stream data to the primary flight computer. This is %100 speculation. I would be curious to know what kind of temporal precision is needed for rocket control, since if it is a sloppy enough process then all this worrying about timing it for nought.",1321858928

Jedi and Sith represent the allegorical extremes of human nature for Lucas, in the same way the Republic and Empire represent idealized democratic and authoritarian societies.<p>The reason the author sees ""psychopathy"" as a common trait is that the first three films show ostensibly good characters morphing into bad ones as they embrace violence and deceit as a means to an end (ending a trade dispute, fighting terrorists, etc.). There is complex manipulation of the same symbolic imagery Lucas uses in his original films (water, caves), sometimes to the point of sequences going over-the-top: the transformation of C3PO from protocol to battle droid in a hell sequence marking the end of the second film is a commentary on what is happening to the rest of the characters, who also abandon diplomacy for ""aggressive negotiation"".<p>The Jedi are not unambiguously good by the end of film III. They are harbingers of war (""there is no war here unless you have brought it with you"") who die marching into battle. Now, the films may not be as emotionally engaging as their predecessors, but they are leagues more subtle than almost anything else you see in cinemas, as evidenced by the fact that Lucas made an anti-war film a blockbuster at a time when American society was broadly supportive of imperialism and military vengeance. As I remember, it wasn't until Anakin explicitly began aping Bush/Jesus in the final film (""you're either with me or against me"") that anyone really seemed to notice the political agenda.",1321858861

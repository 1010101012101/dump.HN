For example, Mondragon is a federation of coops some of which have hundreds of employees; they&#x27;re not going to have a debate with everybody about everything.<p>Another way to think about it is that cooperatives are the ultimate expression of a democratic workplace. Yet it&#x27;s not as if every law were discussed by everybody in a democracy.<p>In a way, that shows that we have a lot to learn about how cooperatives can work. The quote of the union representative is very relevant: Cooperatives aren&#x27;t magic dust, even though I personally believe that they are one of the key tools for dealing with the problems of capitalism. As a society, we simply have too little understanding of how cooperatives work, and until enough experiences is collected and networks exist to advise founders of cooperatives, and all those other little things that help traditional business founders are extended to cooperatives, it&#x27;s going to be difficult.",1423259893

9011824,comment,9009379,9009379,0,0,TaylorAlexander,,,"I&#x27;ve been dreaming lately of starting up a worker coop in silicon valley that focuses on consumer robotics. Is anyone interested in something like that? I&#x27;m an extremely capable hardware guy with a broad skill set and extensive robotics and manufacturing experience. I&#x27;m running my own little start up now that could help fund initial operations, and could use some people who excel at software, mechanical design, or general operations.<p>I am really troubled by the way traditional companies exploit workers, and see that as a major problem of our age. If you could show the world that a worker coop could succeed doing something highly technical like robotics, it would serve as proof that the cooperative model can work for more than just chicken farms. I&#x27;d be focused on growth like a silicon valley startup to some extent, but quality of life for everyone in the organization would be a big deal.<p>I&#x27;m also kind of curious about B-corporations, which allow a specific public benefit to share standing with profit as a legal goal. This would be more silicon-valley friendly as far as funding, since worker coops don&#x27;t have the same revenue generating opportunities for investors. Though the coop could agree to some kind of internal &quot;revenue tax&quot; to pay back investors or save money.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some wealthy people just give their money away to talented organizations that want to spread public good. What I&#x27;d love most would be to just work on open source robotics that help the world. I&#x27;ve been developing a system for 3D printed robotics that use as few non-printed parts as possible, making it easier to collaborate online with hardware designs. I don&#x27;t typically even use screws, since sourcing them can be expensive and slow - most parts just snap together or interlock.<p>An alternative plan though is for me to get rich the traditional way and then use my own money for good, so I am going to be checking out the new YC RFS for hardware whenever that comes out. I have some good ideas about improving life in the kitchen that might be workable. :)",1423259792

<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2198255"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2198255</a><p><i>you are better off taking the mental energy you would have expended on &quot;investing&quot; and subsequently worrying about your money, and instead funneling it into your creative endeavors. You will make more money that way, especially when you take a long-term view.</i><p>...<p><i>If creative endeavors are profitable, you can use the resulting money to fuel more creative endeavors, thus making the world a better place. Keeping money in a bank account or publicly-traded stock does not particularly make the world a better place.<p>Once I got approximately into the f-you money level of income, it became crystal clear how fictitious money is in the first place. I wake up one morning, and bam, I am wealthy! Why? Because someone said so and typed a number into a computer. Okay... that&#x27;s kind of weird.<p>Given that money is so fictitious and somewhat meaningless, it is a shame to give into primal hoarding impulses, just so one can see the number in one&#x27;s bank account go up like a high score in a video game. It&#x27;s much better to make like Elon Musk and use your money for what it is: a way to wield influence to make the world more like you would like it to be.</i>",1423259739

I&#x27;ve been looking into sizes of various online communities, and decided to look for any hard statistics on the actual traffic levels of Usenet back in the day.  So I looked up the old admins.  One of those is Eugene &quot;Spaff&quot; Spafford.  Also known as something of a security expert -- he wrote the book on it:  <i>Practical Unix and Internet Security</i> (PUIS).  I&#x27;ve a copy on my shelf.<p>He&#x27;s at Purdue these days, and his homepage there (<a href=""http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/</a>) lists a PGP key (<a href=""http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/pers/pgp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/pers/pgp.html</a>).  So I grabbed that, <i>and</i> ran a fetch of the <i>signatures</i> for the key.  If you want, you can speed that with a bit of shell magick:<p><pre><code>    gpg --list-sigs &#x27;A40F862E&#x27; | grep ^sig | 
        cut -c&#x27;13-21&#x27; | sort -u | 
        xargs --max-args 10 gpg --recv-keys
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s a limit to how many keys keyservers will return, but 10-20 seems a generally safe bet.<p>Wrote my brief email using mutt (which was designed as a reference case for MIME-encoded PGP email), and awaited a response.<p><pre><code>    I no longer use PGP.  Please send me readable text.
</code></pre>
Yes, from Spaff.<p>So I sent him the unencrypted text, he found my Usenet questions interesting.  But I was curious about his lack of use of encryption.<p>He responded (and gave me permission to quote him):<p><pre><code>    I don’t have a convenient PGP implementation for my Mac.  I used
    to use the commercial version, but it requires Java and that’s a
    huge risk.  GPG implementations require lots of software I don’t
    entirely trust, plus there is no nice interface to my email.
</code></pre>
So yeah.  The guy who wrote the book on Unix and Internet security, stymied by lack of a decent client.<p>Until mainstream vendors are integrating this, we&#x27;re going to be stuck.<p>There are other issues.<p>If I&#x27;ve got multiple devices, I may well wish to use different keys on them.  Which means I&#x27;ve got a key-management issue of having people use <i>the right</i> key(s) on messages.  There&#x27;s the problem of key loss (you lose access to everything encrypted with it).  There&#x27;s the challenge of inputting long passphrases on Mobile devices (I&#x27;d far prefer a OTP / keyfob type solution or other form of semi-physical security, plus a shorter passphrase).  There&#x27;s device-based backdoors and other exploits.  Etc., etc.<p>I&#x27;ve used PGP/GPG for nearly two decades.  It remains something of a pain to deal with....",1423259690

But before it can realize its aim of emancipating the laboring masses so that they will receive the full product of their labor, the land and all forms of capital must be converted into collective property. As long as this is not accomplished, the cooperatives will be overwhelmed by the all-powerful competition of monopoly capital and vast landed property; ... and even in the unlikely event that a small group of cooperatives should somehow surmount the competition, their success would only beget a new class of prosperous cooperators in the midst of a poverty-stricken mass of proletarians. While cooperatives cannot achieve the emancipation of the laboring masses under the present socioeconomic conditions, it nevertheless has this advantage, that cooperation can habituate the workers to organize themselves to conduct their own affairs...&quot;<p>~ Bakunin",1423259351

To me that sounds more like just staffing for normal operations.<p>At large engineering companies this is typically handled via literally having someone standing by, i.e. formally on duty, rather than having off-duty employees be on pager duty. There&#x27;ll be at least a bare-bones staff on the after-hours shift (probably not in all offices, but in some kind of 24/7 operations center), enough of a staff that reasonably foreseeable things can be handled. Of course there are some pros and cons to that from an employee perspective. On the one hand the night shift isn&#x27;t that pleasant, but on the other hand your responsibilities are at least formally limited to 40 hours/wk; if you&#x27;re on night shift one week, you don&#x27;t come in during the day, or carry a pager during the day.",1423258573

I read these slides and think, this is someone that doesn&#x27;t like JavaScript and is trying to make it more like languages they enjoy, like Java. Trying to eek out every performance improvement possible by removing developer friendly features is not a good idea.<p>&quot;let&quot; scoping is a terrible idea, it is not at all sane. Functional scoping is clean and simple, there is only one thing that scopes variables, functions. Thats it. Easy. Block level scoping will introduce coding nightmares trying to figure out what scope your variable is in. I can just imagine the nightmare code people are going to write interspersed with both var and let, and having to figure out how the variable was declared to know its scoping rules. GAH.
Not having to tell the compiler what kind of variable you are trying to use makes coding so much simpler. Not having to cast variables manually is a godsend. And this is considered a good thing to take away?<p>Reading further into this presentation, it&#x27;s clear that the developer wants JavaScript to be Java. any<T>...? No no no no no no no.<p>Keep classes away from JS, unneeded complexity. Classes are inherently complex compared to the simplicity of prototypes. Classes sound like such a good idea, until you are knee deep in the inheritance chain trying to figure out where some method or attribute is defined and/or overwritten. They are one of the biggest reasons people need to use an IDE to write code.<p>Just learn JavaScript, guys. It&#x27;a a really simple language, just not like the ones you learned in university.",1423258180

A date night? Planning on doing any of those things? Be prepared to get pulled out at any moment to deal with something that could take hours to resolve. This was the part that really got to me.

Don&#x27;t forget about driving through places with less than great cell phone coverage.<p>3) It can be fun<p>There was a part of me that really liked the adrenaline rush of getting paged in on a legitimate security issue and having to run the call and pull the right people in to get the situation handled. It&#x27;s a great test of how well you know the environment and where all the pertinent information lives.<p>4) Know the team size and oncall frequency
akg_67&#x27;s estimate was spot on. Anything shorter than a month is crazy and you never quite feel like you normalize. Since it&#x27;s based on team size, know what the optimal size of the team is and that there&#x27;s funding for it? My team imploded and at the end there were only a few of us on the oncall rotation. Bear in mind that oncall duty doesn&#x27;t go away because you no longer have the staff to make it manageable.<p>5) Vacations and sick time are now more complicated<p>Who has to be oncall during Christmas/4th of July/etc? What used to be some loose coordination with your manager is now a give/take discussion with your team about who covered the last holiday and who&#x27;s turn it is. It&#x27;s all completely fair and reasonable and if you have a good team dynamic you can make it work, but it&#x27;s definitely more complicated than telling Aunt Edna that of course you&#x27;ll be home for Christmas.<p>6) Get paid for it<p>Whether in flexing the hours for the time spend working a page off hours or by getting paid directly for off hours work. No reason to kill yourself for no additional compensation (and there will be those hellish pages or that automated alarm that goes off hourly starting at 3am).<p>7) Put the operational burden for supporting a thing in the hands of the people who have the ability to fix it<p>There should be a cycle of:
Get paged
Root cause
Fix
Post mortem

It&#x27;s great if you like working on small tasks that are truly dynamic.<p>Sometimes, getting paged allows me to get my head clear of your normal responsibilities. I kind of use the pages as a nice refresher for my regular work. However, personal preference.<p>To comment on one of akg&#x27;s points, the length of the schedule rotation can actually be a problem. Longer than 6-8, and you are then very detatched from the operational issues your team is having. Make sure you link up with the previous primary to get the run down on anything (and maybe even the person who was primary before her).<p>You definitely want to get more familiar with the team you will be rotating with, but:<p>1: Do not fear escalating to secondary / asking for help when you need it. While getting paged sucks, every team I&#x27;ve been on this has been one of the biggest guidelines. We would rather someone ask for help sooner, than do something they are unsure of / delay fixing something.<p>2 (More like an extension of akg&#x27;s #6): This is something to clear with your boss, but when I&#x27;m on call I also try to put the engineering effort in to fix alarms that are less than ideal. If I get paged at 3AM for some bullshit reason, I will spend the time the next day to make it alert when there is something actionable to be done.<p>If you are at a startup it&#x27;s probably unlikely you&#x27;ll be reimbursed for your cell phone (receiving calls). However, they should have provisions for mobile internet. Using your personal cell phone for work-related activities could have interesting legal implications. If the company is getting investigated, your personal phone could (in theory) be included as work-related things have gone through it.<p>I&#x27;ve been on pager duty for a few years now.

Like most teams that have this duty, we cycle a developer each week to have the responsibility to answer any escalations that might occur. The role of this developer is simply to mitigate the issue. Investigations into the root cause and potential preventative items are reserved for work hours.<p>The amount of escalations obviously varies from week to week. Some weeks I forget that I&#x27;m even on call (well that&#x27;s actually not true as we have to carry a Lumia 1520 - the thing is a fucking brick) while other weeks are absolutely painful (waking up every couple hours in the middle of the night). Thankfully we have enough developers on the team that I&#x27;m only on duty every 6 to 7 weeks. What also helps is that my manager has no problem with me sleeping in and showing up late after a long night of escalations.  Overall it isn&#x27;t too bad and in fact sometimes can be fun to solve head scratching issues. Honestly, the worst part of being on call is not being able to make plans that would involve you being far away from a computer.

The biggest problems with Titanium were not performance. A couple of the most common complaints:<p>1) You don&#x27;t have full access to native SDK functionality (e.g. all the latest cool things in iOS8). You&#x27;re going through a cross-platform API wrapper and limited to the choices of the framework architect. So it can be frustrating to go down this path only to find you still can&#x27;t quite get the native experience you want.<p>2) Debugging is harder because the native toolchain (e.g. Xcode) doesn&#x27;t understand the framework. You have to rely on tools provided by the framework.<p>AFAICS the author doesn&#x27;t address these issues. He seems to focus largely on the (theoretical?) performance optimization of not crossing the JS-to-native bridge as much in React... by being even more isolated from the native APIs and doing more work in JS.

9011525,comment,9010765,9010765,0,0,drostie,,,"Another fun fact is that the +−−− metric allows relativity to be described in a spinor calculus (which are in turn isomorphic to quaternions).<p>The basic idea looks like this: annex the identity matrix as σ_0 = onto the 3 Pauli spin matrices σ_1, σ_2, σ_3 and then form the product with any 4-vector v^μ to find that every 4-vector is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix,<p><pre><code>    V = v^μ σ_μ.
</code></pre>
Of course there&#x27;s nothing special about the +−−− metric here; but when you calculate the determinant of V you find:<p><pre><code>    det V = v^μ v_μ
</code></pre>
so that the determinant is the Lorentz metric. This means that Lorentz <i>transforms</i> preserve determinants in this system. There is the 4-reversal C = \v → -v as well as the parity transform P = \v → (det v) v^(-1), with time reflection T = CP as usual. Lorentz transforms which do not have those reflections in them instead have some complex matrix det L = 1 such that they take the form<p><pre><code>    \v → L v L†.
</code></pre>
Now think about the vectors in this system. A good way to poke inside the vectors is to look at matrices which are <i>projections</i>, det V = 0 so that<p><pre><code>    V = [α] [α* β*] = u u†
        [β]
</code></pre>
If you actually work it out, things like α/β work out to be stereographic projections of that null vector on the celestial sphere. The Lorentz transform takes the vector u above to the vector L u. So when you look at, say, incoming light rays to a point (say, yourself), those points are shifted by this L matrix, performing a bilinear/Mobius transform of the incoming light rays.<p>By ignoring rotations (which are unitary matrices!) and going for boosts, you can quickly convince yourself that as you boost in a direction, the stars all &quot;tilt forwards&quot;, and you can dream that maybe if you were a photon, in addition to living a timeless existence, maybe only the event which emitted you is behind you, while the entire universe lies in front of you.",1423256523

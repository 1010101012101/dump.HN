My response is &quot;I don&#x27;t&quot; and then I shut up.<p>To overgeneralize, though not by much, SF startups suck ass at recruiting; the standard assumption is the whole world is chomping at the bit to work there, and it&#x27;s a privilege to do so.  (Though I do wonder how they get that worldview to comport with endless bitching about the lack of engineers.)<p>And you hit the nail on the head with the lack of consideration of recruitees&#x27; time.  Take linkedin.  I interviewed there a couple years ago when I was living in sf.  They wanted me to come in 10 - 3, so basically an entire day of vacation (read ~$300-$400 I won&#x27;t get paid out when I quit.)  So I had a nontrivial amount of skin in the game.  I also had to borrow a car to drive there, since I didn&#x27;t own one.  The interviews went really well, and they where pushy about continuing -- I was privileged to be able to come in a <i>second</i> day between 10 and 1, ie a second 1/2 day of vacation and go rent a car again!

In particular, they said &quot;&quot;claims, which merely require generic computer implementation, fail to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention&quot;&quot;<p>Historically, federal circuit precedent said exactly the opposite - that when a generic computer was programmed for a specific purpose, it was now a special purpose machine and patentable.</i><p>1) Your argument does not refute the GP&#x27;s statement. A &quot;specific purpose&quot; is not necessarily an &quot;abstract idea&quot;, depending on how the claims are structured. A claim saying &quot;presenting ads in such a way that it is unobtrusive on a computer&quot; is an abstract idea[1]. A claim that specifies how a computer can, say, examine visual or DOM elements on a page to determine where to place ads such as not to be obtrusive, is much more concrete.<p>2) A generic computer running a program <i>is</i> a special purpose machine: it&#x27;s now doing things it could not do before it was programmed to do so, and as such, it is performing potentially novel functionality. Otherwise, in my mind, you might as well argue &quot;a kitchen knife could not be a murder weapon because it&#x27;s a <i>kitchen</i> knife.&quot;<p><i>> This decision should, if the federal circuit actually follows it, knock out a large set of software patents.</i><p>I&#x27;ve looked only at a few particular areas, but all the &quot;old idea, only on a computer / on the Internet&quot; patents I&#x27;ve seen so far (like [1]) the one should have expired by now.

Aside from occasionally judge Lourie, who wrote the plurality opinion for the CAFC, there are no apparent judges on the CAFC who care what the Supremes have to say. They don&#x27;t have to; the Supreme Court can reverse on average one or two patent cases a year while the CAFC takes a thousand.<p>The CAFC will eventually overturn this case just as they have been making progress overturning KSR v. Teleflex, a much more important precedent. [0] Obviousness would have taken care of many more abusive troll cases than this one if it were taken seriously, but the Supreme Court cannot force the CAFC to do anything.<p>The CAFC judges are mostly chosen from organizations that depend maximizing the power and scope of patents, largely appointed to please that patent bar, esteemed and supported by the social and intellectual environment of the patent bar, invited to speak and surrounded by patent bar lobbyists, and promised their chances to make millions after retirement -- if they wish -- back in the patent bar.<p>The idea of a single subject court was a novel experiment in 1982 but it&#x27;s a disaster and a failure from a judicial and technical perspective. It&#x27;s even worse for innovative American businesses.

7917944,comment,7917361,7917471,7,0,grey-area,,,"For the majority of web content today, HTML5 is actually surprisingly appropriate, if a little verbose. I&#x27;d contend it is also appropriate for most documents/data of the future too - WebGL is not required or suitable for most content (which is text/media based, not 3D models or animated shapes). Of course some widgets or effects might use GL behind the scenes, but the browser should insulate the users from that sort of thing, and GL is hardly a model API either. A raw JS and WebGL engine would be a creature of nightmares if you ask me! If you consider the content on a page of comments like this one, what improvements would a WebGL engine give you?<p>The real pain points in the web of today speaking from a web developer perspective are CSS, JS and the DOM. It&#x27;d be nice to see the webkit browser makers get behind alternative style sheets, and alternative languages/APIs, because both CSS and the DOM have serious flaws and omissions which, while they are slowly being addressed, still cause a lot of pain.<p>It&#x27;d be great if language creators could write plugins or compilers to see their language of choice as a sandboxed language available on the web, and see those bundled with browsers, and it&#x27;d be great if browser developers took a serious look at alternatives to CSS for layout - something much simpler could work so much better, and maybe we need different styling languages for different purposes (for apps or for documents for example). HTML is pretty flexible and people could always define fallback CSS for browsers that didn&#x27;t support the new stylesheet variants. There&#x27;s no reason browsers can&#x27;t support a few languages with improved DOMs and a few styling languages. Sadly, I suspect we&#x27;ll just see browsers bumble along adding some modules on CSS and improvements to JS instead.<p>One of the big attractions for me about server-side development and HTML is that you can use whatever you like on the back end, as long as you feed the client HTML. It&#x27;d be lovely to see that sort of freedom to experiment extended to the front-end as well. If the web is to be an operating system, let it be an open one.",1403207229

7917922,comment,7915706,7917882,3,0,YZF,,,"Because the CPUs are so tightly coupled to their peripherals (e.g. the L1 cache) it is extremely hard to give other blocks on the same chip the same access.  I&#x27;ve seen this over and over in SoCs.  Something like a video codec, even though it&#x27;s on the same die, doesn&#x27;t have a tight interface to the CPU.  Even something like a SIMD unit doesn&#x27;t always have the same interfaces though it&#x27;s part of the CPU.<p>Being on the same die is better than being on a separate chip but there are some internal interfaces that rely on placement and latency on the die.  E.g. it&#x27;s unlikely that you can add new instructions to a CPU via FPGA or have the FPGA interact with the L1 cache.  It&#x27;s more likely there will be some sort of shared memory and standard peripheral interface to the FPGA (e.g. interrupts, I/O).<p>EDIT: So to expand on this the FPGA is expected to have a relative high latency to the CPU and a relative low bandwidth to external resources (e.g. if you compare the CPU interface to L1).  It&#x27;s unlikely that the FPGA will have the same cache hierarchy that a CPU core has (size and performance).  So it&#x27;ll be useful where change is expected, the bottleneck is compute, the task is highly parallelizable, the standard instruction set/other blocks aren&#x27;t very good at, and going for a pure ASIC solution doesn&#x27;t make sense (either in a separate block or onboard a customer version of the same chip) either because of price/time/volume.",1403206910

7917791,comment,7915706,7915706,1,0,YZF,,,"Sounds like a bit of a gimmick.<p>FPGAs are typically used in ASIC development to emulate the ASIC being developed.  I&#x27;ve seen boards with 20 FPGAs emulate an ASIC design at <~1/10th of the speed at >>x10 power.  While FPGAs are programmable hardware they are far less efficient than custom hardware for various reasons.  Naturally ASIC emluation is an application where FPGAs have a very large advantage over software... At volume they&#x27;re also a lot more expensive and good tools are also <i>very</i> expensive (virtually no mass produced commercial product uses FPGAs).  Now obviously if the FPGA is inside the Xeon you&#x27;re not really paying much more for it (except you lose whatever other function could be crammed in there).<p>Companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Google have enough servers to make a custom block inside Intel&#x27;s CPU more attractive than an FPGA in terms of price/power/performance (and they can get that from ARM vendors which is probably scaring Intel).<p>CPU vendors have spent the last several decades moving more and more applications that used to be in the realm of custom hardware to the realm of software.  There are certainly niches of highly parallelizable operations but a lot of general purpose compute is very well served by CPUs (and a lot of it is often memory bandwidth bound, not compute bound).  Some of these niches have already been semi-filled through GPUs, special instructions etc.<p>The FPGA on the Xeon is almost certainly not going to have access to all the same interfaces that either a GPU or the CPU has and is only going to be useful for a relatively narrow range of applications.<p>I think what&#x27;s going on here is that as the process size goes down simply cramming more and more cores into the chip makes less and less sense, i.e. things don&#x27;t scale linearly in general.  So the first thing we see is cramming a GPU in there which eventually also doesn&#x27;t scale (and also isn&#x27;t really a server thing).  Now they basically have extra space and don&#x27;t really know what to put in it.  Also each of the current blocks (GPU, CPU) are so complicated that trying to evolve them is very expensive.<p>EDIT: Just to explain a little where I&#x27;m coming from here.  I worked for a startup designing an ASIC where FPGAs were used to validate the ASIC design.  I also worked on commercial products that included FPGAs for custom functions where the volume was not high enough to justify an ASIC and the problem couldn&#x27;t be solved by software.  I worked with DSPs, CPUs, various forms of programmable logic, SoCs with lots of different HW blocks etc. over a long long time so I&#x27;m trying to share some of my observations...  If you think they&#x27;re absolutely wrong I&#x27;d be happy to debate them.<p>EDIT2: Re-reading what I wrote it may sound like I am saying I am an ASIC designer.  I&#x27;m not.  I&#x27;m a software developer who has dabbled in hardware design and has worked in hardware design environments (i.e. the startup I worked for was designing ASICs but I was mostly working on related software).",1403205349

7917789,comment,7915706,7916738,2,0,Florin_Andrei,,,"> <i>any function important enough to require an FPGA can more economically get absorbed into the nearest silicon. For example, consider the serial/deserial coding of audio/video codecs. That used to be done in FGPAs, but got moved into a standard bus (SPI) and moved into codecs and CPUs.</i><p>But isn&#x27;t that because, back then, CPUs simply weren&#x27;t fast enough for decent video coding? And they still aren&#x27;t blazing fast for that purpose - compared to GPUs (see GPU-enabled video encoders).<p>I think the main argument against FPGAs is that it&#x27;s still a chore to re-purpose them. Sure, it&#x27;s not as painful as making a new chip from sand, but it&#x27;s harder than applying code changes to software running in production on CPUs.<p>If it&#x27;s a relatively simple algorithm, that changes rarely, where speed is the main bottleneck, that&#x27;s a very promising scenario for an FPGA.",1403205305

The goal is to give developers the education and tooling they need to do well out of the box by following all of our best practices straight away.

7917733,comment,7915706,7917492,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I haven&#x27;t used either of them. I played around with Systems C a bit when it was the rage but found that my issues weren&#x27;t in optimizing some bit of C code with a better opcode rather it was assembling a system with the peripherals I wanted in the places I wanted them.<p>For a long time I considered soft CPUs a bad idea (the Stretch guys kept trying to sell me on them but since I wasn&#x27;t really doing things like deep packet inspection I didn&#x27;t have a good use case, even RAID algorithms on them were better handled by pretty generic DSP type architectures.) However in playing with the Zedboard which has a couple of Cortex A9&#x27;s attached to the Xilinx fabric I find some interesting things there. If only as a new kind of &#x27;i/o&#x27; but that is neither I/O port based nor memory map based (it expresses as memory but it feels different than the memory mapping of old like on the PDP/VAX machines and 68K systems). Could just be nostalgia though.",1403204713

7917729,comment,7916230,7917623,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> The old version of SOA focused on defining the protocols and API&#x27;s that services would use to communicate, from the top down. There was a lot of effort put into standardized object definitions and CORBA and EJB, and standardized protocols like SOAP.<p>I think that CORBA and EJB are sort of the institutionalization of the SOA concept, in much the way that rigid, top-down practices like Scrum are part of the institutionalization of Agile.<p>I don&#x27;t think original SOA was any more heavyweight, top-down than original Agile; I think people tend to naturally gravitate toward centralized, top-down ways of doing things, producing a natural cycle of &quot;back to basics&quot;, followed by centralizing, top-down approaches trying to impose more definition and manageability on the &quot;new&quot; approaches. (And are aided in this by tool vendors, who want people to buy exclusively into their tools rather than have heterogenous environments, for clear commercial reasons.)<p>There&#x27;s also new techniques that develop in parallel to the cycle and stop the cycle from <i>strictly</i> being reinventing the wheel, usually, but the basic pattern is largely cyclical.<p>>  Services from many different languages and platforms co-exist. That&#x27;s the whole idea.<p>That was a widely touted feature of old SOA, and of <i>earlier</i> (but by now somewhat old) reactions to the way old SOA went as heavily platform dependent services became common in it.",1403204598

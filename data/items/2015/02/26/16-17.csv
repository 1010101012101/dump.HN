The main thing is that you have a bunch of components that you expect to fail. If they don&#x27;t get confirmation, they send another message to the next component. Then, there&#x27;s a stateless, unambiguous way to determine which message &quot;wins&quot; in case of conflict. For instance, an order submits two shipping requests for the same order. They use, for instance, the highest message ID (a GUID) to avoid duplicate processing.<p>It&#x27;s all very neat, though I&#x27;m doing a bad job explaining.

9113535,comment,9112964,9112964,0,0,stolio,,,"Here&#x27;s the pith:<p>> &quot;At the base of it, we do need those 13 vitamins. If you don’t have enough of them, you’ll die in often quite gruesome ways. Scurvy is a horrible disease. It prevents your body from making collagen, which is the connective tissue that holds your body together, so you sort of fall apart from within—your teeth fall out, your connections all loosen, and you hemorrhage and die. So I think it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that we do need vitamins. And there are a lot of people in the world who don’t have access to them—the latest estimate I read was 2 billion people [who are vitamin-deficient]. If you give someone vitamin A and they’re suffering from nutritional blindness, which is a stage of vitamin A deficiency, they will regain their sight, often within days. And that’s crazy. It’s like a miracle drug. But it doesn’t translate into the idea that we seem to want to have, which is that if you can cure nutritional blindness with vitamin A, then if you take 17 times that amount in a pill, you’ll be able to see in the dark. The idea that more is better, and more gives you superpowers, is not true.&quot;<p>Saying &quot;vitamins are a waste of money&quot; is arguing against the extreme case where somebody believes they&#x27;ll gain super-powers from vitamin loading, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be directed at people who take vitamins to avoid deficiencies.",1424969884

You could do a two-phase commit where each participant in the distributed transaction tells the transaction manager whether it thinks its local transaction can go ahead. &quot;A single no vote is enough for the transaction manager to send out a rollback to all parties.&quot;<p>For each of these approaches there are issues, obviously, and to his credit he&#x27;s pretty even-handed about them.

Now I could cook big meals for just myself to eat 5 times along with buying in bulk, but this means a significant loss in freshness and variety (eating the same meal 5 times a week, 4 of those reheated, and bulk items mean the same core ingredients for multiple weeks).  Finally top this off with the notion that more mouths to feed tend to mean more bodies to help cook/clean, and I personally find that this tips the scales to making cooking far less worthwhile when you are doing it by yourself for yourself.",1424969432

Disclosure of current salary ultimately hurts both parties.<p>I was once offered a position by a certain well known Las Vegas based ecommerce company while I was living in Salt Lake and working in Park City. They asked my current salary and I told them (like a chump). When my offer finally came through it was for less than my current salary (ouch). I assumed this was a really weird way of telling me &quot;no&quot;, so I declined the offer.<p>I immediately got a call from their HR wondering what the problem was. When I informed them that I wasn&#x27;t going to move to Las Vegas and take a pay cut they dug in their heels and argued that their offer was really <i>more</i> than I was currently making since Las Vegas is so much cheaper than Park City (as I mentioned above, I never actually lived in Park City but that didn&#x27;t seem to dissuade them).<p>If I had responded to the &quot;how much do you make?&quot; question by telling them how much they needed to pay me then instead of wasting everyone&#x27;s time they could have terminated the interview process or even better, made their offer without being confused by irrelevant salary data.<p>At my most current job I told the recruiter right up front what my requirements were and told her I didn&#x27;t want to fly out for an in-person interview unless we agreed on ballpark numbers. She came back with an acceptable number (which I accepted when I later saw it on the offer letter) and nobody&#x27;s time was wasted.

This is Kris Szafranski (@druidsduel), the guy in the article.<p>I have often wondered the very same things, so hopefully I can remove the mystery here for others.<p>There is nothing particularly special about my story. It&#x27;s something of a combo of what wallflower and GuiA wrote already: opportunity, making connections, and tons of hard work.<p>I have a publisher, Surprise Attack Games. They contacted me after seeing the game on IndieDB.com. This was after the Kickstarter, which was indeed very small. The KS was my experiment in self-marketing, something I have very little experience with and in the end it got funded, but it was a struggle and a dose of reality. I hired PR help during the KS as I knew very few people in the industry media directly and social media only gets you so far. I also started attending as many local meet-ups as I could, getting to know the game dev community around me. They had amazing advice and support.<p>Surprise Attack is an indie publisher and I am not a Big Client. I thought my odds were best with a publisher and the deal didn’t come with any advance or other investment. So aside from the KS, the game is self-funded. I only went with the Surprise Attack after we agreed that Steam would be included. Until then, it was more of a distribution deal, which they publically offer to indies on their website.<p>The publisher used a well-known gaming PR person to handle the release. We pitched the author of the article two ideas and she liked them, combining them in a general human-interest type thing. A similar story ran locally last year in Minneapolis where I am based. My former gig was at a popular local company and my work their gained me supporters. This past experience has helped me a ton at having the confidence in networking and talking about my game.<p>In the end it’s just one article and my game’s success or failure is still very much up in the air. I just followed others’ advice: talk about your game all the time, to everyone. Know your audience and make them something they want to play.<p>I&#x27;ll happily answer any other questions you have have.",1424968826

To do this, they need to know how much total salary a new starter has earned so far in the current tax year, in order to make the correct determinations about tax rates and therefore deduct the correct withholdings before paying salary.<p>So, when you leave an employment mid-year you get an official record of how much you&#x27;ve been paid so far that year in that employment, along with how much was deducted for taxes etc. A new employer will normally want to see these records for any previous employment within the same tax year.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean they can actually see your previous salary. If you started on 6 April (edit: This is the first day of the new tax year in the UK) and therefore hadn&#x27;t had any previous employment in the same tax year, or if you had previously worked multiple jobs, or had a pay rise, or anything else irregular, then they can&#x27;t do the arithmetic to reverse engineer the salary from what they&#x27;ve been told for tax calculation purposes.

I <i>think</i> that the way to foster simple deployment of updates services is making them distinct deployable units, and the most obvious way to do that is to put each on its own cluster of servers - although in most cases this is way overkill in scale.

It generalizes other reoccurring patterns such as power laws, Euler&#x27;s number, the normal distribution and the fibonacci sequence. For some reason nature is surprisingly frugal regarding the forms and behaviors that she allows. I think the simpest explanation for that comes from the anthropic principle and the multiverse hypothesis which state that all possible physical laws are realized in different universes and we happen to be in the one that has the necessary conditions to bring us into existence (universality being perhaps one of them).",1424967237

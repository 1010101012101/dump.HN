2086856,comment,2086738,2086738,0,0,jcr,,,"I doubt the Verizon ""unlimited"" claim is sincere. Let me explain why.<p>When Verizon rolled out its 3G data plan (EVDO Rev.0) in 2005, they <i>initially</i> sold an ""unlimited"" plan. Very few smart phones could do EVDO, so it was mostly the sale of USB dongles for use with laptops and similar.<p>In 2006, Verizon started terminating ""abusive"" users for downloading too much on their supposed ""unlimited"" plan, and after much wrangling, Verizon finally declared that using more than 5GByte/Month of network traffic is their line in the sand for ""abuse.""<p>The above resulted in a class action suit for false advertising. The way Verizon resolved the dispute is not very well known. They simply changed the terms for new customers so new customers would pay per KB fees for everything in excess of 5GByte, and the new accounts were no longer advertised as ""unlimited.""<p>The old customers were allowed to keep their ""unlimited"" status and use the connection as much as they want, but if transfers got too far past 5GByte, the connection would be throttled back to a slower speed. As the saying goes, the old customers were ""grandfathered in"" with basically the old terms. --The reason, of course, after a few years is most people would make changes to their account, like accepting a ""free"" new phone/dongle offer, and create a new contract under the new LIMITED terms.<p>Since I was an early adopter, I have an old ""unlimited"" account. I refuse to change the account, so it remains unlimited. Only on very rare occasion do I see it get throttled for a few days until the billing cycle ends.<p>With the new iPhone offering, Verizon might be using the same ""unlimited"" tricks to get early adopters. It will be interesting to see how this works out...<p>EDIT: precafinated typos",1294617530

The people who love perl don't seem to be interested in moving the language forward and shedding the old ways of doing things.<p>Now.. CPAN.<p>Let me explain my latest round with fighting Perl/CPAN.  I wanted a perl interactive mode.  When I want to test out something in Ruby I use irb.  In Python, I can type in `python` and enter interactive mode.  Even PHP has a rudimentary interactive mode now.<p>So I try looking at `perl --help`.  Nothing there.  So I turn to google and find that I need a REPL whatever that is.  So I try to figure out what a REPL is.  Find that.  Now I find that I need to run a little script to run Devel::REPL.  Doesn't work.  So I load up CPAN and type in `install Devel::REPL`. No less than thirty  minutes later, 150 or so screens of noise, and at least 25 questions that I have to hit [enter] for I get a failed install.  I have no clue what failed -- something to do with tests (the error is 4 screens back in the middle of even more text) so I try to force the install.  I'm now 45 minutes into this and finally get Devel::REPL installed.  I fire up re.pl and I get `SCALAR(0x100b81070) is not of type SCALAR at /opt/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.9/namespace/clean.pm line 56`.

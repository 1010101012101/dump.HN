I started doing so because of non-coding reasons but reading the Wikipedia article it is listed on that page.<p>I&#x27;m concerned about the long term effects of taking a psychoactive substance every day. However the one that I take has been used for a while so the long term effects are probably more well known that some of the new ones like Modafinil.<p>I would be extremely careful and think twice about going down this road unless you absolutely need to. I have a lot of experience fiddling with my body chemistry and usually I decide to stop after a while.<p>IIRC Sigmund Freud had a similar experience, where he injected himself with cocaine 3 times a day for ten years and wrote about it... then after he stopped came to the conclusion that the cocaine was distorting his perception and that he was actually full of shit. Cocaine is not too different from many of these substances.<p>Enjoy and be safe!<p>EDIT: bonus reading for the weekend: <a href=""http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/weaknesses.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/weaknesses.html</a>",1426942301

It makes your train of thought very hard to derail.  I still take it sometimes but not regularly.  It hurts my stomach and can be a bit too much sometimes.<p>As far as I understand, lecithin breaks down/converts to choline an inositol, and it&#x27;s these which are causing the mental effect.

I&#x27;ve found over that time some things that work for me, and many things that don&#x27;t. While not all of the following are strictly speaking nootropics, they all contribute to my overall mental state:<p>- Aniracetam. Helps a lot with my concentration and working my way through problems logically.<p>- Caffeine/L-theanine. Caffeine is a no-brainer, but l-theanine is amazing in that at a 2:1 ration of l-theanine to caffeine it removes essentially all the jumpiness of the caffeine.<p>- Tianeptine. This is an anti-depressant that also helps a bit with my anxiety.<p>- Noopept. This one helps with my concentration quite a bit, and also makes my vision more vibrant. The vision thing doesn&#x27;t matter so much, but it&#x27;s pretty neat.<p>- Rhodiola. This helps tremendously with my anxiety and stops me from ruminating.<p>- Taurine.

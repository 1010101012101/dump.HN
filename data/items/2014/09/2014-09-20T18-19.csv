Plea bargains are a necessity: jarring as it is for us to consider this, most felony† defendants are in fact guilty, as a simple consequence of how policing works. It doesn&#x27;t appear that way to us intuitively, because we only hear about the interesting cases.<p>That&#x27;s not a defense of US criminal procedure! We have a terrible, back-breaking policy flaw: sentences are much too onerous, as a result of several decades of &quot;war on crime&quot; legislation from the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s, and 90&#x27;s.<p>† <i>The word &quot;felony&quot; there is important.</i>",1411239538

If you make no shipment statement, you must have a reasonable basis for believing that you can ship within 30 days. That is why direct marketers sometimes call this the &quot;30-day Rule.&quot;<p>> If, after taking the customer’s order, you learn that you cannot ship within the time you stated or within 30 days, you must seek the customer’s consent to the delayed shipment. If you cannot obtain the customer’s consent to the delay -- either because it is not a situation in which you are permitted to treat the customer’s silence as consent and the customer has not expressly consented to the delay, or because the customer has expressly refused to consent -- you must, without being asked, promptly refund all the money the customer paid you for the unshipped merchandise.<p>It&#x27;s worth reading over the document in its entirety - lots of interesting points and details.",1411239514

Through 2001, Dune, and hundreds of short stories you had writers redefining what human minds were capable of.<p>That changed in the 80s, with smart transcendent machines taking the place of smart transcendent humans.<p>There were a few evil overlord AIs, but a lot of SF AI went in a transcendent direction, while SF humans were evicted into a universe of parasitic aliens and noir dystopias filled with comic book ultra-violence.<p>As tech gets closer to real AI it has become more obvious that there&#x27;s a huge difference between Artificial Intelligence in the traditional comp sci sense, and Artificial Personality, which is something else entirely.<p>The idea seems to have been that if you get one you&#x27;ll get the other for free.

Defending cyber infrastructure is hard. Incredibly hard. If you only play defense you lose. Always. 100% of the time.

Leaving infected CDs, harddrives, and USB sticks near the company HQ of the business they buy their point of sales device from? Creating rouge access points or using femto cells to gain access to company devices? Hacking into home devices of employees? Attackers planting backdoors into the hardware at the manufacturing level?

Let&#x27;s take the example of opens source software, specifically linux kernel you mentioned. Anybody can create a mirror of linux kernel sources. Would that mirror be up-to-date? Who knows. How we solve this problem? We have a network of authoritative mirrors, we have signatures, we have places where new persons can discover which mirrors are recommended to be used. Does this mean if you want to open a new mirror you&#x27;d be banned from doing so until you prove you&#x27;re worthy? No. But in order for your mirror to be useful by more than yourself, you&#x27;d have to convince others you are.<p>Same can work with legal and scientific information. Let&#x27;s even say federal government, with all its trillions of dollars, can not afford hosting a free information site. Removing merely legal hurdles, while keeping paid access, would allow volunteers with cooperation of trustworthy organizations - like universities, major NGOs, etc. - to raise private funds to keep free mirrors alive and up-to-date.<p>This is a solved problem, the only thing preventing its deployment is the legal prohibition. Quality is not a problem, we know how to solve quality issue. Swartz tried to use technology to go around legal hurdles - unfortunately, in current environment this no longer works, law has caught with technology enough to resist attempts to work around it with technology.

8345240,comment,8344429,8344429,6,0,ARothfusz,,,"One of the problems with writing about super intelligence is that none of us are smart enough to do it. Writing already makes us wittier than speaking, giving us a chance to edit our words and show our thoughts in the very best light we can. So in a way, we&#x27;re already accustomed to reading at a slightly brighter level than we live every day. How could we stretch this even further to create dialog for superintelligent people and machines?<p>These aren&#x27;t my own thoughts -- they&#x27;ve come up in a discussion of _Flowers for Algernon_ which I read somewhere and don&#x27;t seem to be able to cite now. In _Flowers_, the author gives momentum to his eventually super-intelligent protagonist by starting off with severe mental handicapping, then spending a majority of the story at normal intelligence before allowing us to imagine his next state. It is a great writing technique, giving direction and then leaving things to the imagination. Imagination is like a variable that scales the amazingness to fit each reader. I think movies often fail to leave enough space for imagination -- when they&#x27;re left spelling everything out to the least imaginative member of the audience they leave everyone feeling limited and dissatisfied, glum.<p>If you want upbeat AI Sci Fi, read a book.

If somebody would pay your ISP for revealing your data - that would be bribery. However, paying ISP to get favorable business deal, like better channel, is no bribery - no more than hiring a private limo for higher price than riding a bus is a bribery of public transportation system. The business of ISP is to provide connections, and paying them for better connection become bribery only if you consider yourself somehow entitled to be provided these connections and not just entering a contract and paying for service. With all respect to Berners-Lee, I don&#x27;t see where that entitlement would come from.<p>>>> In other words, if you need to pay the gate-keeper for equal access to the subscribers then that&#x27;s bribery because the common-carrier principle holds that no priority should be given to other people&#x27;s packets over yours<p>That&#x27;s a circular argument. You declare that ISP has no rights to provide different levels of service (as if that was some obvious law and not the very point being argued) and then conclude that if they do it, it&#x27;s bribery. But of course, pre-assuming this makes the whole discussion pointless as you declared the victory for yourself before it begun. However, that declaration is baseless - ISP can have different levels of service and do that regularly - they offer different bandwidths, different channel types, etc., etc. and restricting them from doing so serves to purpose but to satisfy a perverted feeling of &quot;fairness&quot; - maybe I cannot buy the best service but at least nobody else can too!",1411237971

Then offered &quot;friending,&quot; basically to the extent of LinkedIn - see job info, school, etc. Then offered photo albums. And then one day said &quot;oh all this goes into your facebook profile, we&#x27;re a social network now.&quot; The end product would be the same as what we have today.<p>Would we would probably all be shoveling the shit onto them too? Probably. But that doesn&#x27;t inherently make &quot;facebook&quot; a terrible product, or the idea of tying all those services into a single social network &quot;insane,&quot; I don&#x27;t think.<p>I think from a meeting-room/white-boarding level, what google was trying makes a LOT of sense. It makes Google&#x27;s offerings more cohesive. That it doesn&#x27;t happen to be the way YOU as a customer sees or wants to see Google was not considered (and that&#x27;s their failure). They seemed to just be running on the vision of what the end product would look like, which would be a competitor for Facebook, but with VERY different, several unrivaled sub-offerings. Turns out they forgot that how they get there matters a lot too.<p>I also think they were on the pathway to innovating further, starting with Hangouts...no other social network where nearly all your friends were gave you multi-way voice+video chat, sharing the same YT video, etc. I think they could have done more, but G+ just sucked so much that it could probably never get any of its labs features off the ground.<p>I hate G+ as much as the next guy, and especially hate how Google tried to shoehorn such a bad product into every google user&#x27;s lives. But that doesn&#x27;t mean their vision was nonsensical. It was probably a bit of tunnel-vision though, and it unfortunately did not take their existing userbase&#x27;s sensitivities into account.

This in of itself is very revealing about the nature of our culture. If you contrast the work from the early 1900s to the mid 1900s, as personified by Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, then a lot of the stories were based around conflict, but the transgressor was in fact a complex chain of events or a third party entity and the AI was a factor as opposed to something evil that needed to be taken down.<p>Even for the events in 2001, Clarke painfully explains over the course of the second novel that the AI had been driven insane by conflicting goals imposed by human authorities who should have known better, but didn&#x27;t. The AI lashed out in madness not because it had malevolent intent. In fact, much of the themes of those books could be summed up in, my friend - this really awesome and earnest robot - and me are out in the vast cosmic unknown and it&#x27;s desolate, lonely, and I&#x27;m one step away from going looney, but luckily my friend - the robot - is here for me.<p>>>> When it comes to assessing how people might react when blessed with superaugmented intelligences, there are plenty of cautionary examples of people with natural but notable extremes of intelligence who&#x27;ve been tripped up by crippling vulnerabilities. <<<<p>Except, if you examine this belief then it is a somewhat recent thing. If you go back a few decades, then there was marked optimism about how humanity was going to evolve beyond our very humdrum beginnings into something like the star child Dave Bowman becomes at the end of 2001 - a gift that&#x27;s bestowed upon him by benevolent alien entities working with a machine.<p>There are actual surveys which show the rise of this distrust, it is very much an artefact of modern culture as opposed to being something inherent to technology itself.<p><a href=""http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/new-study-reveals-a-startling-distrust-of-modern-technology-among-americans-24482"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/new-study-reveals-a-st...</a><p><a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/read/it-doesnt-matter-that-americans-are-scared-of-new-technology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/read/it-doesnt-matter-that...</a><p>>>> For all the article&#x27;s comments about the &quot;mindboggling&quot; potential of Moore&#x27;s law, my word processor looks about the same as it did nineteen years ago, and computers still suck at simple games like Go that, unlike chess, can&#x27;t be brute forced. I&#x27;m grateful to Google for making finding information that bit easier, but I&#x27;m even more grateful for humans for creating or curating the content in the first place. <<<<p>Except now you have this one organisation that has written this magical piece of code that executes in parts across millions of individual computers to search trillions of documents and gives you the reply to any question within milliseconds. This allows you to access all of the world&#x27;s information on a slab of glass and plastic that is portable and can help you communicate with most of humanity.<p>At the other end, we finally have control systems that can turn an entire rocket into a robot - allowing it to perfectly hover in mid air and land on its own. A feat that would have been deemed impossible if not magical a few decades ago.<p>Sure, there are so many things that need to be done, but where we are going is fundamentally beautiful and wonderful. Technology continues to be simply magical, but just not the ways we want it to be. This in of itself says nothing about the technology, just about how we&#x27;re focussing our attention as a society and as a civilisation.<p>We can still make magical nuclear reactors and go to mars. There&#x27;s nothing stopping us, but us. All of those challenges can be surmounted if we push and develop the promise of our tools and technology. We can indeed do another Apollo and the fact that such a thing doesn&#x27;t exist isn&#x27;t a fact about our tools, but it&#x27;s a fact about us.<p>So all in all colour me puzzled over why technological pessimism is on the rise.",1411237294

8345142,comment,8344355,8344747,7,0,ScottBurson,,,"It&#x27;s famous for several reasons, which you are surely aware of.<p>The most obvious is that the suicide of a well-known, brilliant, and promising young activist gets people&#x27;s attention.  It&#x27;s natural for people to mourn, to some extent, and to wonder what he could have done with the rest of his life had he not ended it.  It is a very sad thing.<p>Also, it brought to a lot of people&#x27;s attention, including mine, some of the problems with both the CFAA specifically and with the way that federal prosecutors routinely abuse their discretion generally.  Orin Kerr discusses both of these points in the second part of the piece you linked to [0].  I&#x27;ll quote one passage:<p><i>On the third question, the issue of who was to blame if the prosecution was too severe, I think it’s important to realize that what happened in the Swartz case happens it lots and lots of federal criminal cases. Yes, the prosecutors tried to force a plea deal by scaring the defendant with arguments that he would be locked away for a long time if he was convicted at trial. Yes, the prosecutors filed a superseding indictment designed to scare Swartz evem more in to pleading guilty (it actually had no effect on the likely sentence, but it’s a powerful scare tactic). Yes, the prosecutors insisted on jail time and a felony conviction as part of a plea. But it is not particularly surprising for federal prosecutors to use those tactics. What’s unusual about the Swartz case is that it involved a highly charismatic defendant with very powerful friends in a position to object to these common practices. That’s not to excuse what happened, but rather to direct the energy that is angry about what happened. If you want to end these tactics, don’t just complain about the Swartz case. Don’t just complain when the defendant happens to be a brilliant guy who went to Stanford and hangs out with Larry Lessig. Instead, complain that this is business as usual in federal criminal cases around the country — mostly with defendants who no one has ever heard of and who get locked up for years without anyone else much caring.</i><p>I agree wholeheartedly.  But for many of us, it was the Swartz case that brought this issue to our attention in a big way.  I think it is natural for us to associate the issue with Swartz even if we agree with Kerr that the problem is hardly confined to this one instance.<p>As for the CFAA itself, Kerr argues, and I again agree, that the provision triggering felony liability is much too broad.  Had the statute been reformed as Kerr suggests, Swartz might not have been looking at a felony charge.  I agree that Swartz should have faced <i>some</i> punishment, even if just a misdemeanor conviction and probation.  It&#x27;s really the looming felony conviction that Swartz was unable to swallow, and I am too.  It highlights how the federal criminal law has grown into a monster.<p>If you want another case that shows the same thing and should also be famous, the George Norris felony orchid smuggling case [1] would be a great choice.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.volokh.com/2013/01/16/the-criminal-charges-against-aaron-swartz-part-2-prosecutorial-discretion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volokh.com/2013/01/16/the-criminal-charges-agains...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2009/07/the-unlikely-orchid-smuggler-a-case-study-in-overcriminalization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2009/07/the-unlikel...</a>",1411236621

Then once they feel like they&#x27;ve gathered enough cards to compensate them for their time, or if they feel like they&#x27;ll lose access or get caught in the near future, they dump them in bulk batches. Generally these breaches, and the company that was breached, get discovered after the very first dump batch. The banks who issue the credit cards can often figure out what store was breached if they&#x27;re given a random sample of 1000 or so credit cards; they just correlate the cardholder locations with the stores in the area, and see what store has the most overlap. Often bank security personnel are some of the first to buy the credit card dumps. In fact, this is how Home Depot and Target both found out they were even breached at all: the banks ran their analytics on the dumps and informed them.<p>After the first batch is released, the subsequent batches are usually less likely to work, but sometimes the banks will just issue notices saying &quot;you recently shopped at Home Depot, please check your account statement&quot; instead of blanket disabling all the cards. In those cases, staggering the dumps in batches increases the overall fraud gain.<p>You can learn more about these kinds of tactics on Brian Krebs&#x27; blog: <a href=""http://krebsonsecurity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krebsonsecurity.com/</a>",1411236488

586387,comment,586313,586313,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I suspect this is Apple's response to a phenomenon originating from China. I've been reading up about the Chinese knock-off cellphone, or ""shanzhai phone"", industry. It has become an incredibly lucrative business. Why? Because, it's now possible for a company, comprised of a small group of 3-5 people, to design, build (or rather contract to a factory), and market phones. The technology has gotten to the point where most of the difficult technical design hurdles have been removed by the presence of a cellphone-on-a-chip so-to-speak. Sound familiar to anyone around here? So you have these tiny, agile startups being able to compete with the big boys. A lot of the big boys are still in denial, and will probably try to respond to the shanzhai phone industry by attempting to get the Chinese government to crack down on it. Not Apple; their approach will be to out-innovate these players by playing off the one weakness that they have: that they cannot design their own cellphone-on-a-chip.<p>I won't make any predictions about whether Apple will still be a dominant player in the cellphone market 10 years from now. However, I will say that this move almost surely guarantees they will still be in the game by then. Other companies that rely on the same logistics and supply chain that the shanzhai guys do probably won't be as lucky unless they change their strategy as well.<p>UPDATE: The reading I've been doing was on my iPhone and I didn't bookmark everything.

586384,comment,585324,585646,0,0,Dove,,,"When I was forced to learn Ada for my current job, I was skeptical that it would be a good experience.  But I must admit, I like being able to declare things in feet and meters and have the compiler complain when I try to add them.<p>But it's overbalanced by the sheer amount of effort necessary to make the compiler shut up when I <i>do</i> want to do that.  Something like half my Ada code winds up as inane type conversions.  I find myself very hesitant declare things in feet and square feet and milliwatts and meters because I know what a phenominal amount of work I am making for myself.  Writing in Ada is a strange exercise in type engineering, trying to get exactly the amount of error-checking that I want out of the compiler without distracting myself too much from the actual problem I'm trying to solve.  I'm rarely successful.  I once recently spent four hours developing an algorithm in Perl, and then--with it understood and debugged--two days translating it into Ada.  Most of that time was spent making reassuring gestures toward the compiler.<p>Then again, the extreme permissiveness of a language like Perl has its own drawbacks.  I recently lost a whole day to a function I thought was expecting named parameters (but which wasn't).  Ubiquitous default values and silent conversions are nice when you're expecting them and brutal when you aren't; to write efficiently, I must sprinkle die everywhere.  And that's the catch: I'm not persuaded that truckloads of 'turn error-checking on' incantations are an improvement over truckloads of 'turn error-checking off'.  It's inane code either way.<p>When you get right down to it, one size doesn't fit all, even within the same program.  Ideally, I'd like a language that let me 'tag' variables and functions with types or units or associations, and let me decide when and what to check by default in what contexts.  I'd love a language that stopped me from setting a variable in feet to one in meters, but also gave me a way to say ""don't check units on this line--it's a formula--but please still check my pointer indirection"".  Alas, between building Perl up, quieting Ada down, templating C++, or simply building a baroque OO hierarchy in Java, nothing I've used seems really robust and flexible enough to serve this purpose well.",1241065142

Maybe Spitzer should have spent a little less time with his mistresses and a little more actually understanding the firearms industry in the U.S.<p>First, there are a lot of companies that sell exclusively or almost-exclusively to the civilian market, or are kept alive in between periods of major government purchasing by the civilian market.  E.g.: Bushmaster, who is almost certainly one of those companies that Spitzer would like to punish, doesn't shy away from military/LEO orders but is primarily a civilian arms company.<p>Given the choice between relatively consistent sales on the civilian market or feast-and-famine by selling to the government (who can inundate you with orders one year and leave you with nothing the next), it wouldn't surprise me if some manufacturers just turned down government orders if they came with too much red tape.<p>The net result of Spitzer's plan might be a decrease in the number of suppliers willing to deal with the government, rather than the civilian market; it might also cause companies to split off rough parts production and have the finish work done by separate companies -- one for the government and one for the civilian market.<p>Of course, if such a scheme keeps people like Spitzer occupied and from making a real mess, more power to it.

1437888,comment,1436610,1436904,0,0,ianbishop,,,"The majority of the file details what happened to the documents locked in Tesla's safe at the New Yorker Hotel. His closest US relative, soon to inherent his effects, was considered to be a communist by the US Department of War.<p>In order to protect the government from the potential outcome of those documents (wireless power, death-ray), the US Alien Property Custodian seized the documents where they were eventually scanned into microform by the Navy. Once it was declared there was no potential harm in these documents, they were returned to the Tesla museum. When they were received, Tesla's golden Edison medal was missing.<p>(Interestingly, it is noted the man who scrutinized Tesla's safe belongings was humiliated by Tesla earlier when he reduced the man's design of two 34-foot towers to two 2-foot of Tesla's own. Maybe it is not coincidence it is missing?)<p>The rest of the documents are mostly just rejections of requests for details or sources of materials which people thought the FBI had under confidentiality, when really Alien Property had them. There are some interesting letters such as EE students looking to reproduce his experiments, biographers requesting more information and one guy linking series of unexplained plane crashers to Tesla's death-ray.<p>This part in particular was probably the most exciting, leaving much of the interpretation of the censored parts to the reader:<p>""This individual mentioned the FBI at length in these communications, pointing out that Mr. Foxtrot had been called in on the Tesla case but was killed shortly thereafter.""<p>""He stated that the FBI investigated this matter but their hands were tied, that there was nothing the FBI could do as they had been stopped from a higher level, that -------- the FBI Agent he dealt with, resigned and requested -------- never to discuss the matter with him again, that he had a wife and family to consider and that the last hope was Congress.""<p>[Insert permanent marker here]<p>""We did have an Agent, --------- who entered on duty -------- resigned [black]. The file does not indicate that we have ever interviewed ---- on the basis of -------- allegations.""<p>Anyway, save yourself an hour or two.",1276746934

The pressure differences are not significant until/unless drilling into an oil or gas pocket.

I think you're a short-sighted, self-centered, argumentative, nihilistic, and stubborn little annoyance -- but I didn't yet disrespect you enough to say so.<p>Look, requiring a guarantee that such a disaster cannot occur is exactly the opposite of placing a value on disaster.

I prefaced that guarantee with the word ""near"" because I pragmatically don't believe there's such a thing as a complete and total guarantee.

And how do you propose to measure that risk? These types of situations are after all inherently unforeseen.<p>Anyway, by admitting that a near 100% guarantee is good enough for you (no matter what that ""near"" is), you've admitted that you're willing to put a price on it. That price is, naturally, the dollar amount that would be required to reach the level of guarantee you want. So yes, the rest of this conversation has just been you being difficult.",1276744726

As a couple of people mentioned, instruction creation is a pretty infrequent activity - so a pay per month pricing scheme may not work best. VerticalResponse.com comes to mind (not associated in any way; I don't even use them) - in a market where monthly fees are the norm, they have a pay as you go plan that's tied to distribution (numbers). On another minor point: maybe it's me, but the 'appliance' bit had me expecting a device; I was happy to see there was none.",1276744611

Every project uses up its complexity budget one way or another.   The budget is not determined by the language, but by the culture and skill of the people doing the work.<p>As a simple language, Java tends to result in complicated frameworks.   This is a problem because every framework is complicated <i>and</i> different - you can't infer what one is doing by knowing another.   Given this, I like having the complexity supported in the language.   I'm going to have to deal with it anyway, but at least I can count on the language being the same where ever I go, so I can learn it once and have a reusable skill.",1276744583

It it's a matter of writing a regexp for the HTML source, it's fine. If it's a matter of running some complicated software with complex rules for each and every site you can find on the net, I think it's less good..<p>By the way: if you want to write a script for yourself for this purpose (I mean, stripping out invisible/out-of-screen tags), I think it can turn really difficult pretty fast because of the cascading nature of CSS and the possibility of the complex rules you can generate. So basically you'll have to interpret the whole CSS tree and count the position of every element, taking into account all the rules of CSS - for me it feels like implementing half of a browser's rendering engine. Oh, and have we talked about the possibility of setting a CSS property from JS? (eg. making every tag hidden and then show the 'true' e-mail address after the JS has loaded)",1276743751

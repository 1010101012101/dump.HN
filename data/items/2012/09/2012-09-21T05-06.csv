It's pretty obvious this is about perceived hypocrisy on Apple's part. Apple sues for trade dress violations and has now been caught for reproducing someone else's design. It acted against what it perceived as a crime against itself and yet committed the same crime. Simple hypocrisy, aka moral inconsistency in actions - nothing weird about it.<p>If SBB wins, the natural response will be to nod and say Apple got its just deserts. Some people will argue these designs shouldn't be copyrightable in the first place, but that's a separate criticism and does not invalidate the point of hypocrisy in the first place.<p>(Does it really surprise you that some in the community aren't happy about Apple's win over the patents?)",1348206157

I'm betting not.<p>First, this <i>is</i> indeed obfuscation. There undoubtedly is a constant key. The point is merely to make it difficult for an attacker to automate an attack with ""grab the attribute with key X"". It's possible these attributes are HMAC's of the attribute name + a randomly generated secret, which is actually a pretty good use of encryption under the circumstances. It's certainly miles beyond what most other sites use, and makes attacks against the HTML5 a waste of time (way better to go after the elements in the DOM, which have constant names).",1348206094

In which case you have it backwards, and the satire here should be something about how Apple has no right copying someone else's hard work just to make a quick buck, and that a numberless clock face with highly contrasting colors seems obvious <i>now</i> only because they went to so much effort to work it out.<p>Except that's not very funny, because it's exactly right.

My dedicated GPS unit has told me I've arrived at my destination in the middle of a busy highway, and it too has asked me to turn through concrete barriers more than once. I've had both direct me to locations well off of where I was trying to go.<p>This is all from actual usage.<p>So if anyone knows of something that doesn't have these problems, I'd love to hear from you!",1348203807

It's fantastic for trying to navigate around a city while travelling, which I used today.<p>I like it better than Street View - though Street View is better when you're on foot and need to find the entrance to a specific street address.<p>So, overall iOS 6 maps aren't as good as Google Maps, completely agree, this is a debacle.  But there's one feature I like.",1348203797

I assure you that, with enough skill and effort, one can make photorealistic renderings that, to the uninformed, look like the product is ready to go and that the funding is a mere formality.  No, Kickstarter did the right thing here.<p>That said, I am hoping that they will allow 3D renderings and animations as added illustrations if and ONLY if one shows actual realized versions of the proposed hardware in the project.  The reason I say this is that 3D renderings and animations are extremely useful tools for the communication of function and some ideas that might be hard or impossible to convey using actual hardware.  A good example is a cross-sectional cut showing moving parts.",1348203676

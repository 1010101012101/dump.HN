Assuming that the technology can be reasonably coppied in less than $100k, apart from users what else does facebook have? They also have a very powerful brand. Given that myspace went for $440m (correct?) then the facebook valuation probably is reasonably fair.<p>Anyone suggested just paying 20 million users $100 each to join and use your social network for 1 month, hehehe, seems like you could 4 times as much money :-)",1172447129

Also I was thinking how the facebook api is a genius move by facebook. The friends network is a barrier to entry for any new vertically integrated social network, so if you can effectively use the friends network established in facebook it gives you a lot of power. Wider adoption of the api would strengthen facebooks position as well. They probably need to make the api more powerful, which they might not be willing to do.",1172446807
1094,comment,638,638,0,0,dangrsmind,,,"Many NDAs require the disclosing party to describe, list, or specify the confidential items disclosed.  But often I find when very early stage inventors ask people to sign NDAs they often fail to specify what is disclosed even though their agreements require it.  If you ever have to enforce an NDA, trying to argue that the entire conversation was confidential is much harder than simply producing the list of disclosures.\nAlso, I&#39;ve never asked an investor to sign an NDA.  Asking someone to sign an NDA indicates a lack of trust.  IMO if you don&#39;t trust the people you are talking to you probably shouldn&#39;t be talking to them at all.<p>Recently I&#39;ve been asked to sign NDAs as part of employment interviews.  This seems to have almost become standard practice now. I don&#39;t really think this is a great idea, and I often won&#39;t take an interview that requires an NDA.  But sometimes if I am certain that I won&#39;t be developing my own ideas in the field I&#39;ll sign one. Inevitably I find that these employment related NDAs are the most frivolous, silly, and irrelevant ones I sign.  YMMV.\n",1172446767

If there is a programmer not pulling their weight or not passionate about the project or programming in general- move them or help them find another job.

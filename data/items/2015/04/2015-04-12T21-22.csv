Some projects have a problem with that too).<p>But the main reason, almost regardless of context, as to &quot;why not BerkleyDB&quot; is LMDB[1]. It works way better than everything else, in just about every practical use that has more reads than writes.<p>The only downside as far as I can tell, is that right now it relies on memory mapping the entire database, so you&#x27;re limited to ~1GB overall database size on 32 bit systems. There is no practical limit on 64 bit systems. Also, I recall Howard Chu (main LMDB developer) mentioned that in the near future LMDB will gain the ability to manage memory manually - thus removing this restriction as well (for a performance price if used this way).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/downloads/oslicense-093458.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technolo...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/</a>",1428875998

9364871,comment,9362830,9364380,0,0,sparkie,,,"I probably have quite a fundamentalist view on unit testing because I write primarily in purely functional code these days - where a &quot;unit&quot; is a pure function, and it&#x27;s clearly an isolated unit. Even when I&#x27;m back in OOP world though, I basically avoid static variables/globals like the plague. Even where the framework or some library makes use of them, I&#x27;ll tend to wrap them up and pass them into my code via Main, to make sure that no statics are globally accessible throughout the code.<p>If I were testing a salary calculation which takes values from a database, and I named my test &quot;Test_salary_calculation_correct&quot;, where instead of using some sample data which could easily cover the range of values I need to test against, I instead relied on a database connection, and this test failed because the database was not accessible - I&#x27;ve only confused the developer who picks up my shit where &quot;Test_salary_calculation_correct&quot; fails, and he thinks there&#x27;s a problem with my calculation rather than a misconfigured firewall somewhere else. The firewall has nothing to do with my salary calcuation - why should it have any effect on the test passing?<p>The way I see unit tests is this: If you write a test and it passes on your machine, then some other developer takes your code and the same test fails - it&#x27;s a fuckup on your behalf. Unit tests should not depend on the environment in any way. Actually, by definition, a unit test is a test of a single &quot;unit&quot; - including database access into this is well beyond the scope of unit testing, but into integration testing.<p>To me it seems you&#x27;re skipping unit testing and just going onto integration testing with your unit testing framework. I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;ve observed or where, but I can tell you it&#x27;s certainly not standard or best practice in the industry. It might possibly tell you something about your own code style though - are you writing units which can be treated in isolation? (Certainly not if you depend on a SL, which is a global context of services with no clear boundary)<p>Ideally a codebase should be designed to maximize unit-testability and reduce the need for integration testing to as little as possible - since this is where most of the &quot;unexpected&quot;, or &quot;out of my control&quot; problems are most likely to occur. This testing is more a case of &quot;am I handling all the relevant exceptions&quot; than getting green lights to pass in a unit testing framework. It doesn&#x27;t really help to make unit tests against code which is expected to fail out in the wild due to whatever circumstance - what matters here is that your code is prepared for the worst and knows how to recover.<p>It&#x27;s these cases where mock classes are particularly useful - because you can forcefully simluate any behavior from the external service and make sure your code is working correctly for all the potential circumstances. Having to rely on divine intervention to trigger some event that may only happen 1% of the time in the real-world situation is hardly practical. Unfortunately testing in the wild is often like this - everything works fine 99% of the time.<p>Even for cases where you&#x27;re arguing for a fixture with real test data in (from a database), then the reasonable thing to do is extract this data beforehand and encode it into the unit testing language (which is fairly trivial to do). Now you have a reliable test which will continue to work as you update the code. Testing against live data is giving a false sense of security to begin with anyway. Imagine the scenario where you have a bunch of data in the database, you run your unit test against it with all green flags - then after deployment, somebody inserts into the database a value which your code doesn&#x27;t expect. The unit test shouldn&#x27;t be testing against real world data, but against data representitive of the possible values it should accept (ie, include all the obvious edge cases which should fail too, but are not likely to exist in the real world DB).",1428875523

9364857,comment,9362312,9364549,0,0,microarchitect,,,"I&#x27;m not sure if I understand what you mean by accuracy. This is not a probabilistic analysis. The solver considers the space of <i>all possible outcomes</i> for each match and returns satisfiable if there is <i>some</i> set of outcomes that satisfies the constraints. For example, it says that Stoke City can still qualify for the CL, but this requires that all of the current top 4 will need to pretty much lose every match while the teams below them win every match. This is obviously so unlikely to happen that you might as well disregard it it, but it is still a mathematical possibility and so  the solver returns satisfiable.<p>As far as la liga is concerned, yes, you can definitely do a similar analysis. You will have to change the code that calculates the league positions, because in la liga if two teams are level on points then the first tie-breaker is head to head record, and then goal difference if the head to head is also equal.

9364801,comment,9362307,9364065,0,0,zaroth,,,"Entering the conversation very late, but IMO the <i>potential</i> for catastrophic results puts the onus on the school system and teacher to secure the computer. Administration and IT is absolutely responsible for providing adequate and proportional investment into the security of the computer systems based on the level of risk involved from a compromise. The required level of <i>protection</i> is commensurate with the risk. This is standard operating procedure for any kind of security assessment and deployment, whether it be physical or electronic security. The school system and teacher were both grossly negligent in protecting the computer system, and for example, in the case of a data breach (if the standardized state tests that were on the machine were stolen) I believe the school system and the teacher would both be partial liable for improperly securing the device.<p>When an actual crime occurs, the punishment for the act should be proportional to the actual <i>act</i>. Not the potential for someone else with the same level of access to have done worse. E.g. Someone breaks into a house to steal a loaf of bread because they are starving. There were children sleeping in the house who could have hypothetically been kidnapped. We don&#x27;t (or at least, shouldn&#x27;t!) charge the bread burglar with attempted kidnapping or worse because children happened to be present but slept through the entire event.<p>The potential for worse is a clear signal that the school system and the teacher are not doing enough to protect these devices. The problem here isn&#x27;t the child changing the background image, it&#x27;s the lax security of the computer systems. Stringing up the child for changing a desktop background is what&#x27;s missing the forest for the trees. Seriously, thank the child for exposing a clear operational weakness in security controls, fire the current IT department head, and get someone competent to secure the systems.<p>When a criminal act results in <i>actual</i> follow-on damages, then it is appropriate to charge the instigator. If our hypothetical bread burglar broke the lock, stole the bread, and then someone else came in through the open door and kidnapped the children, then absolutely the bread burglar will be charged as an accessory to kidnapping. But there&#x27;s a clear line, you cannot stray into the <i>hypothetical</i> otherwise, there is literally no limit to the hypothetical damage which can be caused by any otherwise inconsequential act.<p>E.g. Jaywalking could hypothetically cause a 10 car pile-up with major fatalities, but we don&#x27;t charge jaywalkers with attempted manslaughter or even reckless endangerment unless there are specific confounding factors -- in almost all cases jaywalking remains a misdemeanor. What this kid did was exactly the jaywalking of &quot;exceeding authorized access&quot;.",1428874204

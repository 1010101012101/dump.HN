But surely you have to agree that your introversion <i>has</i> handicapped you significantly in life?<p>From your own story, it sounds like it stopped you from being able to complete a degree program and has cost you job opportunities.  It sounds like something worth working on fixing or at least working around.<p>I was a super shy kid and am still way on the introverted side of the spectrum.  But I&#x27;ve learned to work on teams and to lead them.  It&#x27;s a skill, like any other.

10294936,comment,10290882,10290882,0,0,78666cdc,,,"As a person that has interviewed for and gotten jobs at multiple Fortune 500s (whose tech departments varied from abysmal to impressive effective) and as a person that has been a part of the interviewing/hiring process several times, I appreciate the attempted formalization of interview metrics and see more than a little value in the metrics described in the article.<p>To me, though, there is one &quot;metric&quot; that trumps all the rest, and that is personality fit with existing employees. If you have two brilliant software engineers that just absolutely cannot stand each other, nothing will get done. The best interview experience I&#x27;ve had, personally, has been to be placed into a technical interview - &quot;start programming application X that does Y&quot; - with two existing employees looking over my shoulders asking me why I&#x27;m doing what I&#x27;m doing and why not something else.<p>The technical justification for my chosen solution to the technical interview question didn&#x27;t matter much once it was clear I covered a base level of technical ability, but it was incredibly valuable that I and the employees looking over my shoulder didn&#x27;t want to get into a fistfight after an hour - it meant that we could amicably disagree, support our reasonings for our arguments, and then not have sticks up our asses when the other person&#x27;s proposed solution ended up being the right one, and then gracefully defer and say &quot;thank you for the conversation and debate.&quot; That meld is immensely important.<p>That said, I do recognize that it becomes increasingly difficult to gauge this sort of interaction with increasingly large teams. My experience interviewing and being interviewed is limited to cases where it&#x27;s been a team of 3 - 8 people. For larger teams, perhaps such a formalized approach makes sense. I do not have any experience that informs me as to whether it is or isn&#x27;t.<p>But then I have to ask whether there should be a team of more than about 8 people without a dedicated manager. I don&#x27;t have anything more than a gut answer to that question, but my gut says no.",1443509673

My family business used to spend over $20k per year on YellowPages ads which drove about 8-12 calls per day at a very high close rate. As YellowPages has died off the money has been invested in an online presence but the skill required to design the site, keep it updated, and to manage all the online advertising spend is well beyond a normal person.<p>The fragmentation impact of having your customers looking for your services in dozens of different ways vs opening the phone book is costly and complex to overcome.<p>Once you pay a designer, hosting provider, and then pour the rest into Adwords it is very hard to get the same 8-12 calls per day with $20k of annual spend.<p>Thumbtack are helping solve that problem and syphoning all the money these businesses used to spend on YellowPages or are wasting on poor Adwords bidding strategies.

On it&#x27;s face it seems very likely that he is guilty.<p>It appears that someone had been stealing money and cooking the books at the hotels Glossip managed, and about the time his boss became aware of the theft, the boss was murdered.  He admits to knowing that the boss was murdered and <i>Glossip admits</i> attempting to cover up the murder, his plan being to dissolve the body in acid.  Glossip, as manager of the hotel the body was hidden in, reassigned cleaning staff specifically to prevent them from discovering the body.  The person who is known to have performed the killing, an employee of Glossip&#x27;s, says he was paid to do the killing by Glossip.  Glossip also split money from the wallet carried by the man that was killed with the killer.<p>Glossip has had a trial and a retrial, and was convicted in both of them.<p>So maybe the death penalty is good, maybe it is bad.  Clearly there is a serious debate there, and I am not attempting to defend the death penalty here.  There is almost no chance that Glossip is innocent, and it seems clear, to me at least, that the state demonstrated he is guilty to the required standard.",1443509494

10294923,comment,10291778,10293273,0,0,yeukhon,,,"IMO, DevOps should not be afraid of reinventing their own wheels. The closer you are to the service layer you don&#x27;t actually manage, the better. i.e. if you use public cloud you should really make use of the APIs and build your own wheels. But of course, use existing tools to do your job first, and slowly create your new wheels. Overtime, the new wheels will function better because they can fit your ever-changing requirements.<p>That&#x27;s my two cents.<p>Sometimes as I am working with boto (Python SDK for AWS), I wish I have the time to write some of the boto modules myself, because they were inconsistent and harder to use than other modules. I can easily create many AWS services with Ansible modules, but I find it easier to hack and integrate more tightly with my environment by writing my own Python code using boto directly. What&#x27;s inside the machine remains to be Ansible because it does a really good job.<p>Another classic example is logstash and AWS logs like cloudtrail, flow log and alarams. I can easily write a parser in Python or in C and get my job done, and overtime the code can be reusable. But with logstash I can&#x27;t guarantee that existing filters and plugins will always work and they get really really messy no matter how good you are with logstash. And that&#x27;s a layer I have to reinvent because of simplicity and total control.<p>I&#x27;d rather pipe to Elasticsearch myself than relying on logstash in cases like that.",1443509350

It&#x27;s ye old object-relational impedance mismatch.<p>A (relational) data model is a single unit.  It has to be seen this way. Creating imperative sub-structures (like encapsulating data into objects) breaks this paradigm with serious consequences when attempting to rejig the object-covered data into an on-demand style architecture.  The whole model (database?) must be seen as a single design construct and all operations against the entire model must be sensitive to this notion - even if we access one table at a time.  Yes, at specific times we may be interested in the contents of a single table or a few tables joined together declaratively for a particular use case, but the entire data model is a single atomic structure &quot;at rest&quot;.<p>When paradigmatic lines like this are drawn, I side with the world-view that getting the data model &quot;right&quot; first is the way to go.<p>Fred Brooks and Linus Torvalds speak from experience in the trenches.",1443509022

Why do justifiable homicides for police and private citizens track each other almost identically?  I can&#x27;t think of any explanation.<p>According to: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/us-police-killings-this-year-black-americans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/us-police-kil...</a> the number of police homicides have also been under reported, historically.  It appears (if the Guardian&#x27;s reporting is correct) that some states don&#x27;t even report at all some years.<p>But let&#x27;s assume that there are 15,000 homicides per year by non-police and that 1000 of them are deemed justifiable homicides (double the reported ones to account for under reporting).  That&#x27;s about 7% of homicides that are justifiable.<p>In the second link, it says that 19 out of 547 were killed by police after they were taken into custody.  31 were killed by tasers.  119 were killed while unarmed.  What percentage of these killings were justifiable?<p><a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/police-rarely-criminally-charged-for-on-duty-shootings-1416874955"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/police-rarely-criminally-charged...</a> claims 41 police officers were charged for shootings in a 7 year period.  That is about 5.86 per year.  The original link claimed about 87% of killings were shootings, so let&#x27;s assume that police are charged with killing linearly and we get about 7 officers charged per year.  I think it is telling that I can&#x27;t find the success rate of prosecution anywhere :-P<p>So if we assume all 7 officers were found guilty, that means we get 540 out of 547 killings to be justified, or 98.7%.<p>So the average citizen has an upper bound of somewhere around 7% of having a homicide found to be justified, while the police have a lower bound of around 98% of having a homicide to be found justified.  This despite the fact that 3.5% of police homicides happen after the suspect is in custody, 5.7% happen as a result of the suspect being hit with a taser, and 21.8% of the suspects are unarmed.<p>While I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a case for &quot;blanket immunity&quot;, I have to say that the numbers do not seem reasonable to me.  Especially if 20 people are killed by police while in custody and there is not an expectation that a charge will be laid in any of the 20 cases, that does not seem reasonable at all given that at least 93% of civilian homicides are deemed not-justifiable.<p>But even more worrying is the sorry state of affairs for the reporting of this data (if the newspapers I browsed while doing my back-of-the-envelope calculations are correct).  If they don&#x27;t have better reporting, I don&#x27;t know how anyone is supposed to scrutinize it.<p>Anyway, I hope someone found this interesting.

He hasn&#x27;t concluded that Glossip is definitely innocent (although he thinks he probably is), rather he&#x27;s concluded that in the absence of physical evidence and with the majority of testimony being provided by a witness who has a clear motive to implicate someone else, that there must be &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;.<p>He may be wrong, and in particular &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; may not have the legal definition that he thinks it does (legal terms rarely match common sense).  But his argument is not &quot;Glossip is innocent&quot;, but &quot;there is no way we have sufficient evidence to kill this man without risking that we are killing someone who might be innocent&quot;.<p>Have you served on a jury, by the way?  I served as the foreman on one relatively minor criminal case, and it did more to shake my faith in the rule-of-law than any other (minimal) encounters I&#x27;ve had with the legal system.   In the end, we reached a unanimous &quot;not guilty&quot; in the case.<p>This was a difficult decision for all of us to reach, since the only way this could be the &quot;correct&quot; decision was if both police officers who testified were lying about significant details both in their report and on the stand.  And yet this is the conclusion we eventually all agreed upon as being the most likely explanation for the way the pieces failed to fit together.<p>The defendant may well have done other illegal things, and possibly the world would be a better place if he was behind bars, but as a jury we decided that there was sufficient reason to doubt that he was guilty as charged.   And yet there was no particular guarantee that this case would turn out as it did.  On a different day, with a different jury, a different judge, or different lawyers, (but the same defendant, witnesses, and evidence) a guilty verdict seems likely.<p>As a limited participant in the legal system (but a &quot;logical&quot; computer programmer) my assessment would be that if we have the death penalty, the American jury system is practically guaranteed to occasionally sentence innocent people to death.  I&#x27;d guess that this is the part that bothers Paul as well, I&#x27;d guess that he probably does have experience that leads him to believe this, and I&#x27;d guess that his opinion on the matter is not likely to be changed by a counterpoint that makes Glossip&#x27;s guilt seem somewhat more likely.",1443507053

I’m surprised by how often it does make sense to invest a bit of run time converting even moderately large volumes of data into some alternative or augmented structure, if doing so then sets up a more efficient algorithm for the expensive part of whatever you need to do. However, again it can be difficult to employ such techniques if all your data is hidden away within generic containers of single objects and if the primary tools you have to build your algorithms are generic algorithms operating over those containers and methods on each object that operate on their own data in isolation.<p>The more programming experience I gain, the less frequently I seem to find single objects the appropriate granularity for data hiding.",1443506562

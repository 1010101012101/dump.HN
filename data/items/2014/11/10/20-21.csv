I haven&#x27;t addressed questions like P(>90%|t=1000).<p>2) Actually no, it doesn&#x27;t take the variance to 0.

8586349,comment,8583430,8586028,0,0,msandford,,,"Agreed, but performing head gasket maintenance is a rare occurrence and loosening of the head gasket bolts is even rarer.  Most of the time that head gasket failures happen is due to process problems on the part of the gasket manufacturer.  The auto manufacturers have figured out how to ensure that they&#x27;re torqued properly at the factory.<p><a href=""http://olybrake.com/pdf/fel_pro_torque_specs_guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://olybrake.com/pdf/fel_pro_torque_specs_guide.pdf</a><p>Most of the plain old torque specs in that brochure are at least 60 ft-lbs and there are some upwards of 100ft-lbs.  That is no joke.  If the bolt is a grade 5, 5/8&quot; nominal diameter tightened to 57 ft-lbs that&#x27;s over 4 tons of clamp force.  At 82 ft-lbs it&#x27;s just shy of 6 tons.  At 113 ft-lbs it&#x27;s over 7 tons.  That&#x27;s PER BOLT.<p><a href=""https://www.fastenal.com/content/feds/pdf/Torque-Tension%20Chart%20for%20A307%20Gr5%20Gr8%20Gr9.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fastenal.com/content/feds/pdf/Torque-Tension%20C...</a><p>Applying 60 or 80 or 100 ft-lbs of torque to a bolt will cause huge amounts of clamp force which highly motivates the bolt not to wiggle loose.  A lot of the problems where bolts (or nuts) self-loosen in high vibration environments is due to a torque spec for a sub-maximal amount of clamp force.  If you&#x27;re making machine tools and you need to tension ball-screw bearings (an application mentioned in the video) you can&#x27;t torque the shit out of things because of the bearing pre-load needing to be a substantial but not insane level.  A few hundred pounds of preload (a reasonable range for CNC spindles or ball-screws) can be achieved with only a few foot-pounds of torque; it&#x27;s exactly what the machine needs but not enough for the bolt to keep itself from working loose.<p>Engine heads and head gaskets are complicated because you have to apply a lot of clamp force very evenly over a large area.  The bolts are more than good enough for this, I&#x27;ve got several friends who are mechanics and none of them has heard of a head bolt that&#x27;s loosened itself.  The problem is that manufacturers often use &quot;inferior&quot; (less expensive) grades of head gaskets because the failure rate is already quite good.<p>EDIT: I don&#x27;t disagree that needing to maintain even pressure is necessary (it is), nor do I disagree that nuts which can&#x27;t wiggle loose doesn&#x27;t help mitigate the problem.  What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the failures which do happen are caused by the weakest link, and that in many cases the weakest link these days isn&#x27;t the bolts or the heads or the block or whatever, but the gasket itself.",1415653027

You are not trolling and it is abuse of the downvote button.<p>> I feel that opinions of issues are heavily influenced by the actors involved.<p>It is not so much individual commercial actors than ISP&#x27;s in general having power. If they were being exploited through regulatory abuse, then they would be in a defensible position. But none of the policy surrounding them harms them significantly more than it helps, in that most of their networks were built on taxpayer dollars and that is a key reason why nobody can compete with them without state funding of infrastructure.<p>> from advertising to the endless variety of consumer goods available to people in the US<p>I agree wholeheartedly advertising is one of the worst industries around, because it creates terrible returns on investment (the real productivity gain of advertising is more informing consumers about goods and services than using psychological manipulation to get people to spend money a certain way).<p>But non-structural goods and services (ie, bread, or housing) has per unit per person utility. Common infrastructure like roads does not behave in the same &quot;here are X units of good and Y units of buyer, and the market will adjust to make sure those numbers stay close to each other regardless of the number of competitors&quot;. With networking, power lines, roads, sewage systems, transit systems, etc - they all have the upfront opportunity costs, say the factory, but their marginal costs are nothing compared to them. Additionally, underutilized consumerate goods can just be shelved until sold. With bandwidth and power, unused power gets rerouted to inefficient storage mechanisms or just burns up on the wire. Unused electrical potential on the lines is just overbuilding without need, because maybe your wattage requirements in a region do not match the wires used (though this is rarely a thing, it is more often under-estimated). But there are no units to sell, and lost potential in the now is gone forever. If you build a highway that nobody drives on the investment was wasted, in the same way building a toy factory that never sells a toy is a waste, but for the highway the marginal cost of a driver on it (basically just wear on the road surface) is pennies, and the highway cost billions, whereas the toy factory cost millions and a million toys will sell for ten million.<p>With network wire the same thing applies. Underutilization means wasted potential, where the wire and infrastructure around it was incredibly expensive but the per-unit costs of electricity transporting packets over it is negligible. This means unlike unsold toys, any second the wire is underutilized is wasted productivity and potential.<p>The factory owner does care if hes manufacturing at capacity, but the market is much more fluid for toys and per-unit volume goods than it is for infrastructure.<p>> And I think that a light regulatory environment would best help foster this technology and encourage new entrants.<p>There are a lot of ways a regulation free market could solve our current networking mess. The biggest one would be that without &quot;ownership&quot; of wireless spectrum, you would have many more channels to broadcast on with radio technology, and could have radios that slide along much greater spectrum bands to find a compromise between bandwidth (high frequency) and range (penetration, mostly, at lower frequencies). You can balance usage more appropriately, and most everything from the 1mhz to 100ghz band is usable to some degree intelecommunications - the lower end is extremely low bandwidth, and the higher end has extremely short range, but in between you have a lot of potential value that is completely absent from the market as it is dedicated to private companies or one telecom provider.<p>In such a market it would not be about last mile probably, because the wireless technology would be so good. It makes a lot more sense to have one router with 100gbit bandwidth for a suburb than gigabit ethernet to a hundred homes, because you have the same underutilization problem on a per-consumer basis, and that last mile cable was the most expensive.<p>Besides that, in a regulation free environment, you could use wifi points to bridge property the owners would not let you lay wire on, or you could have communities agree to lay wire themselves.<p>And of course mesh networks, but there is still no solution for a macroscopic mesh network encompassing millions of nodes - you eventually have to gate them and have centralized routing between subnets because of the algorithmic complexity of each added node in a mesh like that.<p>And you can honestly do that today. You just need to wire between all your neighbors, and if they wire between all their neighbors, and you set up a subnet of your own with proper traffic monitoring, you would have a mesh net running under one backbone connection. But you still need that backbone, and you need to connect to it somehow.",1415652887

8586319,comment,8583889,8583889,0,0,ggchappell,,,"This is a cute little easter egg.<p>However, it&#x27;s actually not too hard to disprove 3987^12 + 4365^12 = 4472^12 with just a calculator. The thing to do is concern yourself with the rightmost digits, not the leftmost.<p>The fake solution is actually a bit better than this article indicates, since checking only the rightmost digit -- working modulo 10 -- doesn&#x27;t show the problem. 7^12 ends in 1, and 5^12 ends in 5. So the value of the left-hand side of the proposed equation ends in 6. And so does 2^12.<p>But checking the rightmost 2 digits -- working modulo 100 -- we can see that it doesn&#x27;t work. 87^12 ends in 81, and 65^12 ends in 25. Their sum ends in 06. But 72^12 ends in 16. So the proposed equation is false.<p>-----<p>EDIT. For anyone who wonders how to do this.<p>Raising a number to the 3rd power, and then raising that to the 4th power, we get the 12th power of the original number. If we are working modulo 100, then we can throw out all but the rightmost 2 digits at any stage.<p>So, what are the rightmost 2 digits of 3987^12? Start by finding 87^3: 658503. We only care about the &quot;03&quot; at the end. 03^4 = 81. So 3987^12 ends with 81.<p>Similarly, for 4365^12: 65^3 = 274625. 25^4 = 390625. So 4365^12 ends with 25.<p>And, for 4472^12: 72^3 = 373248. 48^4 = 5308416. So 4472^12 ends with 16.<p>81 + 25 = 106, which does not end with 16.",1415652767

I work from home as an independent contractor, so no issues with having it for days at a time without hassle of bringing it to work with me every day.<p>Also, for the first week or so your body is adjusting to it, so in terms of social interactions you may not &quot;be yourself&quot;.  For example, for me, I would get tired randomly after a glass.  After that first week or so things start getting back to normal.<p>I sometimes go on work binges depending on what I&#x27;m trying to accomplish, so in those circumstances the last thing I want to do is get up from my computer to spend even 1-2 hrs preparing and eating, then cleaning up after a meal just because my stomach is growling.<p>Second, my personal experience so far has been that it truly does give you that &quot;full&quot; / &quot;satiated&quot; feeling after you&#x27;ve had a glass of it.  More so than pretty much any home or restaurant-prepared meal I&#x27;ve ever had.  It lasts a long time as well.

Now there&#x27;s a basic peace of mind that I don&#x27;t have to compromise nutrition just because I don&#x27;t want to put the time and effort into preparing a healthy meal.<p>Fourth, general energy levels / focus throughout the day.  Probably because overall I&#x27;m eating healthier during busy times, and the formulation is meant to maintain things like steady levels of blood sugar, etc.  You don&#x27;t get the peaks and valleys you sometimes can get after eating a heavy meal.<p>I&#x27;m no fan boy, though it might sound like it.

At the same time, this means it overlaps with downvoting—but only <i>one</i> use of downvoting. Really, the meaning of downvoting on HN is somewhat confused and muddled: is it a &quot;flag lite&quot;? Is it a way of disagreeing? Is it a way to push worse content to the bottom? Is it just the opposite of an upvote?<p>Any one of these would be reasonable, but having all at the same time is not great. But that&#x27;s exactly what we have now, both in the design of the feature and in how it gets used in practice.<p>Personally, I think downvoting should move away from being an alternate form of flagging (with flagging, perhaps, taking a slightly more prominent role for dealing with actual <i>abuse</i>) and more towards just being the opposite of an upvote. This still makes it a bit of a hybrid (both for moving bad content down <i>and</i> disagreeing), but one that makes a lot more sense because it works just like upvotes do.<p>For one, this is what the interface already implies. The downvote button looks just like the upvote button upside down. Seeing the two as exact opposites is entirely natural, and that&#x27;s how it plays out in terms of karma too. But in terms of social conventions and, importantly, greying out comments, this doesn&#x27;t quite hold.<p>I also think that some symmetric way to counterbalance upvotes is actually useful in and of itself: downvotes can offset comments that gain a lot of upvotes before getting a strong rebuttal or comments stuck at the top of a discussion because of other quirks in the system. But people now seem pretty hesitant to use them this way. Which makes sense: if downvotes are, in part, mini-flags, they are too strong just to indicate that you think something has been upvoted too much or is not a particularly good comment (without being <i>bad</i> or <i>abusive</i>).<p>So what would I do? Well, from the site&#x27;s perspective, the main tweak is greying out comments after <i>more</i> than one downvote. Still have the votes change the order, but only have a really visible effect after a few have accumulated. More importantly, from a social perspective, it would be good to reach consensus on what a downvote actually entails, namely that it&#x27;s just the opposite of an upvote, neither more nor less.<p>Disentangling flags and downvotes like this will improve the utility of <i>both</i> features by making them more focused. Downvotes can be a symmetric force in shaping discussion while flags could be pushed a bit more as means of pruning actively harmful comments.",1415652490

There is no reason to assume, as you seem to, that risky things are automatically better for society than non-risky things. IMO common sense suggests the opposite.<p>Also, risk is fungible. If you want people to do a thing that has a 0.1% chance of earning $1m, you can find a thousand people and just pay them $1k each. If you have $1k and want to turn it into a 0.1% of $1m, you can play roulette a few times (not completely free, but the house take is pretty low).<p>> Would as many people play slots if winnings were taxed at 90%?<p>Probably, yes.

I approach it from a productive/unproductive axis. I upvote comments I find helpful, articulate, or informative. I downvote comments I find unhelpful, inarticulate, or uninformative. I leave alone comments that I find &quot;meh,&quot; or that someone has already said better, or that neither add to, nor subtract from, the conversation. Basically: something either adds to the conversation (upvote), subtracts from the conversation (downvote), completely derails the conversation (flag), or is neutral.<p>Case in point: I didn&#x27;t necessarily agree with your comment, but I found it articulate and interesting. It presented a perspective I hadn&#x27;t considered. It made me think. I upvoted it.<p>Now, one could argue that agree/disagree and productive/unproductive are basically the same thing in practice. They both represent a desire to move the conversation in one direction or the other. (To your point about the group dynamics). But I don&#x27;t know if I totally buy into that. I have no idea if this is true, but I&#x27;d hypothesize that voting patterns would be different under one explicit guideline or the other.

Because, I reasoned, that might be a 6-figure deal with a different group of people.  I think the problem is that you state &quot;$200,000 of value to a 10MM deal&quot;.  But &quot;10MM deal&quot; isn&#x27;t what an acquisition starts out as.  It could be a $2M acquihire or $10M deal or $100M package by a competitor who is scared s$%#less of your disruption paying in stock that they fear will lose 60% of its value (along with the rest of their company, worth billions) if they don&#x27;t turn the tides soon on this disruption, by buying an innovative upstart.  They could fear they&#x27;re facing a very binary scenario and don&#x27;t see any other way forward.<p>These deals are not &quot;$2M deals&quot;, &quot;$10M deals&quot;, and &quot;$100M deals&quot; deals respectively, until they happen, and 5-10% either way probably matters a lot less than which of these scenarios you end up living in.<p>This is similar to why it&#x27;s not expensive to pay a CTO 50% equity of your &quot;$2M business&quot;.  Because it&#x27;s not really a &quot;$2M business&quot; it&#x27;s a &quot;$2M business&quot; or &quot;$0 business&quot; or &quot;$5M business&quot; or &quot;12M business&quot; (or the sky is the limit) and the CTO will be quite crucial in determining which one happens.<p>This is counterintuitive.  Put another way, Sergey Brin and Larry Page didn&#x27;t each pay the other guy $30 billion to do what the other guy did in 1998.  (Based on their respective net worth today, and the fact that they had to give up half their company to the other guy in 1998 instead of keeping it all.)<p>Because if they hadn&#x27;t had the other guy, each of them who is now worth $30B wouldn&#x27;t be worth $60B, but rather most probably $0.<p>So saying &quot;2% of a 10MM deal&quot; is like saying &quot;50% of a $374B company.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t work that way.

It&#x27;s been suggested in the past that a similar standard should be present on HN. [2]<p>Considering that flagging is a privilege that can be lost if someone decides that you&#x27;re abusing it, ideally it should be reserved for the egregious cases that are unquestionably bad. Downvoting on HN should be for comments that truly don&#x27;t contribute to the conversation, though the comments in question may not rise to the level of flagging.<p>As an example: Say you have a comment expressing an opinion with no support, no references, and factual errors. Is it &quot;inappropriate&quot;? Arguable. Does it contribute to the conversation? Not in any positive way. I would suggest downvoting that comment would be the right answer, <i>even if you agree with the sentiment</i>, because it doesn&#x27;t positively contribute to the conversation. But flagging wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate considering the comment is on topic and not spam (which <i>are</i> given as criteria in the HN Guidelines).<p>If you encourage downvoting because you disagree with an opinion, then minority opinions get buried. And sometimes it&#x27;s useful to see that an opinion isn&#x27;t unanimous, and that there&#x27;s another side to an argument, even if you disagree.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=721314"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=721314</a>",1415650338

English speakers spend ridiculous amounts of time arguing about these things, and Swedes simply don’t need to. It’s not that English speakers can’t conceptualize the difference between opinion and fact, but doing so is way more difficult in English, because the word “belief” in English is quite fuzzy, whereas in Swedish, the language makes it simply impossible to confuse the two.</i><p>HN voting seems to suffer from an inability to make this distinction: I think it&#x27;s terrific when comments are downvoted because they&#x27;re factually inaccurate, no matter how well they&#x27;re written. So much nonsense ends up at the top of some comment threads simply because it reinforces existing beliefs or loyalties.

Flagging, on the other hand, is meant to call out wildly inappropriate, offensive, or completely off-topic comments.<p>A few hypotheticals:<p>1) I see a comment that is well articulated and generally inoffensive, but I disagree completely with its premise or its arguments --> I do nothing.<p>2) I see a comment that is irrational, illogical, poorly constructed, whiny, or off topic --> I downvote.<p>3) I see a comment that is extremely offensive, completely unrelated to the topic at hand, spammy/astroturfy, or clearly intended to instigate a flame war --> I flag.<p>That said, many people seem to use downvotes to disagree with a comment, and I&#x27;m concerned that lowering the downvote threshold will lead to even more of that behavior.<p>Maybe the problem is that downvoting and flagging share too close of a hypothetical use case. Downvoting is clearly easier to do, and it&#x27;s doable in the main thread view. So that could be why people routinely use it to disagree with comments. I have flagged maybe a grand total of one comment in all my time on HN, and I generally regard flagging as an option of last resort. (It could also be that I arrive at various threads after the worst stuff has been flagged and removed, providing me an artificially sunny view of the threads).",1415649653

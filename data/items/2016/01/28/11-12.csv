The problem is things that are not stimulating become very challanging or even impossible. This is why bills, appointment, rules, and chores can be so difficult for ADHD people to commit to. &#x27;Normal Type&#x27; people may find misery in these sorts of tasks, but they are able to motivate themselves to complete them - and the tasks generally don&#x27;t take that long for them.<p>A good way I&#x27;ve heard ADHD described is that people with the condition have no percetiption of time. If stimulated, its easy for them to loose track of how much time has passed - even forgetting to eat or sleep. If unstimulated, the misery seems to be never-ending, even if it would only take a short time to complete if the person applied themselves.<p>As an example: Michael Phelps (who has the condition) has been very able to motivate himself to practice swimming. Swimming at his level is a very tedious sport, requiring five or more hours a day in a pool staring at the black line on the bottom.<p>I&#x27;ve personally found sport (swimming and extreme) to be helpful in managing ADHD, both while doing the activity and maybe for a day or two afterwards.

It&#x27;s no wonder that developers have become so engaged with React and React Router: it&#x27;s the same mental model as traditional server-only applications. A page is rendered, some changes are requested, then a page is rendered with those changes. The only difference is that this can all happen client-side.</i><p>Our framework does this, without virtual DOM. You build apps by placing reusable components on pages. The pages honor existing web conventions -- so everything works like on the web. But then the framework manages HTML5 history for you, and even swaps javascript/stylesheets in and out as you load pages. It loads the code for pages and components on demand, as you navigate the app, and doesn&#x27;t need a monolithic js and css file (although you could have one). Part of sticking to web standards is you can do things like caching on CDN, or even support caching files inside a PhoneGap bundle, so they load instantly on a &quot;native app&quot;, which you can make.<p><a href=""http://qbix.com/platform/guide/pages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qbix.com/platform/guide/pages</a><p>All this does not require a virtual DOM. React and Mithril are great for virtual DOM but you don&#x27;t NEED it. In fact, the fastest approach to components re-rendering themselves is:<p>1) Have the constructor insert the HTML elements, eg by rendering a template, and <i>store references</i> inside the component to the elements it might want to update.<p>2) When some of the component&#x27;s state changes, simply requestAnimationFrame and make a batched update, using the same convention as react&#x27;s &quot;render&quot; method. Only the components whose state changed will update. That&#x27;s what Angular does: dirty checks the state instead of the DOM.<p>3) Traversing parents and children should be done via the component object tree, not the DOM.<p>And voila. You have the speed you need, where you need it. The main challenges are other things, like registering/unregistering events, activating/removing components while navigating pages, caching, retaining data until you don&#x27;t need it anymore etc. And for that you need a framework.",1453981280

Reading this made me think back on my own struggle with adhd.<p>A few years ago I was diagnosed with adhd at the age of 23, and god damn do I wish it happened a decade sooner, but my parents were the type that didn&#x27;t believe in that kind of stuff, so I was just lazy. It&#x27;s stuck with me to this day even, it took me a while to come to terms with it and I at times I still think I&#x27;m lying to myself and I&#x27;m just lazy, and would never make this post on my main account.<p>I first started seriously considering that it might be something other than just laziness in college when I was studying for finals with some friends and we decided to enhance that studying with some adderall. Everyone got super focused, churning out work and wide awake for hours, except me. I felt pretty much nothing different at first, and was kinda pissed it didn&#x27;t work, but got to studying anyways. The next day I was complaining to my friend about my apparent immunity to amphetamines, and thinking back I realized it might&#x27;ve had an effect after all. Instead of jumping around and doing 50 things at once in no logical order I actually stayed more or less on one thing at a time. I didn&#x27;t get the apparent super human focus and metal boost, and it didn&#x27;t keep me awake for shit, but I got to pick what I focused on. My friend mentioned that having that kind of reaction to stimulants might be a possible symptom of add, but I didn&#x27;t take that seriously, since everything is apparently a symptom of add.<p>Later on I finally got a job with my own health insurance, and went to a therapist for an unrelated reason. Through multiple sessions I unloaded the story of my life, how I could never pay attention to just one thing when I was younger, but I saw it as an advantage because I could context switch between 10 things got damn good at it. How I loved driving so much because thinking about every other car on the road with me and predicting their actions all at once put my mind at ease. But as I got older, the 10 things I tried to focus on each needed a lot more focus than my rapid context switching could provide. It had gotten to the point that holding a conversation was a troubling task because I&#x27;d also be thinking about 10 other things and losing bits and pieces of it.<p>The first time my therapist told me that I may have adhd, I was actually insulted. I didn&#x27;t want to consider the possibility that something was actually wrong with me, I was just lazy and needed to get my shit together.  I never outwardly acted out as a kid, I wasn&#x27;t hyperactive, there was no way I could have adhd. I later realized that a lot of my outlet went into computers instead, where for me the adhd was actually helpful.<p>I continued my sessions, and eventually she convinced me to see a psychiatrist. Over a few visits he also diagnosed me with adhd. I refused to take the prescription and ended up going to two other doctors that gave me the same diagnoses. I finally relented and worked with my therapist and the psychiatrist to set a plan of action. I was prescribed adderall, which I took daily for 3 months. At the same time I also started working on behaviors and methods to cope with it without medication. It was a night and day difference. I remember 2 weeks in sitting in my room almost in tears thinking &quot;is this how normal people think all the time? They can choose? Why the fuck couldn&#x27;t I have that&quot;.<p>After the first 3 months I started skipping my meds for one week out of every month to gauge how well I could deal without. It took about 7 months until I was confident enough to go off of it, but it feels like I never did. As much as I hate pharmaceuticals, there&#x27;s no way I could&#x27;ve gotten to where I am today without. I genuinely feel that I&#x27;ve managed to change something in my brain to a less chaotic process. I didn&#x27;t even know there was another way to think, I thought that was normal. Sure, it&#x27;s still a struggle, and I still have my moments, but I can actually manage my life. I can decide to clean my apartment and not end up starting 5 other projects after 20 minutes of cleaning. The amount of shit I could have accomplished had I been able to handle my mind a decade earlier.<p>Sorry for the long winded rant, but damn it feels good to actually put that into words. I&#x27;m still ashamed in a way of it, it makes me feel &quot;broken&quot; I guess, so no one but my doctors and I know and writing that was a bit of a relief.  I&#x27;m honestly not sure what my point of writing this was, other that to say that while giving kids heavy amphetamines is probably not a great idea, doing something to help from a young age could be massively life changing, and if nothing else is helping, waiting too long for medication probably isn&#x27;t a great idea either.",1453980796

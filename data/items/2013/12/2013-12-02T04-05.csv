Over the last 20 years there have been dozens of books, and thousands of articles, pointing out that few people can beat the market averages. Even professional investors, who devote their lives to following the market, only occasionally beat the market.<p>Posts such as this one are logical and well-reasoned. There is ample documentation of the basic facts of the situation: chances are you can not beat the market average. Any person who, in the year 2013, is still managing their own investments, in hopes of beating the market averages, probably can not be swayed by a post such as this one.<p>Who should manage their own investments? One could make an argument in favor of investing that is similar to the argument some people make in favor of gambling: think of it as a form of entertainment. There are also the rare individuals who have some method that has been shown to work and they follow it with great discipline. But aside from those who find it entertaining, like gambling, and those who have a proven track record, people should avoid trading stocks.<p>But this advice will be ignored.",1385960209

I was implying that by choosing such a horrible bug tracker that you must question their code for mongodb.<p>In retrospect I probably should have added a smiley face or not made the comment at all, since it&#x27;s entirely possible they didn&#x27;t have a choice in the matter and JIRA was chosen for them by a pointy haired boss. After all, I was forced to use JIRA at my previous job and the quality of code I produced and technical decisions I made were not affected by choice of bug tracker.

6831699,comment,6830306,6831525,3,0,shadowfiend,,,"I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a leaky abstraction per se. But there are definitely issues with it—issues things like the Google Closure Compiler try to deal with. One of them is this: eventually, Rails realized you should probably link your application to a particular version of a gem (see bundler), just like the Java world realized web apps probably shouldn&#x27;t be resolving dependencies at runtime (see WAR files).<p>Right now, JS apps are often just serving the latest version of libraries for things like DoubleClick and Google Analytics. Google can update what they&#x27;re serving at any time without letting you know. If you use a build system to bundle the library into your code, you lose the benefits the user could get from already having the library cached. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re exposed to someone else&#x27;s whims on library updates, and you add HTTP requests to boot.<p>The same goes for bundling something like jQuery into your app. You can bundle it in, but that data has to be sent downwire to the client when the JS goes down, even if it is just in one HTTP request. Or you can include it via CDN and a lot of users won&#x27;t have to download it again, despite having to do an HTTP request. So it&#x27;s all about choosing the right tradeoffs.<p>Also, JavaScript runs as it downloads, in page order. So you don&#x27;t have to wait for all 30/X round trips, though you may have to wait for X round trips for the last file (in page order) to run. Then it becomes a matter of prioritizing what needs to load first. Naturally this is stuff we wish we didn&#x27;t have to worry about, but worrying about bandwidth and latency and how and when and in what order things download has <i>always</i> been necessary for network applications, and I don&#x27;t see that need going away anytime soon. I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong though :)",1385960030

It causes real problems in even the medium term.  The &quot;arrogance&quot; judgement is also subjective, since it presupposes a mindset of &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; (which is hardly a singular entity) that may or may not be actually there.<p>&quot;This is our emergent culture: an onslaught of newness, disrespectful of status quo, law and propriety. &quot;<p>There is a lot to dislike about this sentence.  First off is the negative judgement of &#x27;newness&#x27; - we KNOW from neuropsychology that novel inputs to the brain are an essential ingredient to neural plasticity.  New isn&#x27;t just always new, but it&#x27;s part of what it means to be young in the brain.<p>The second part of this sentence is problematic to me.  This almost reads like the author is advocating that respect to the status quo, laws, and propriety is a major virtue.  Again, this is another strong civilization anti-pattern (well the same one basically).  If the author isn&#x27;t saying this, then what is he saying?<p>Look I get it, change is scary.  But the reality is we as a species have wedged ourselves into a weird place.  We must proceed technologically to solve our problems.  That is what Silicon Valley is about - moving tech and science forward to solve problems.  Yeah not all problems seem essential (snapchat), but there is plenty of people who are doing way more interesting things.  But also the pro-rationality, pro-new things, pro-science culture of the bay area is one worth extending and expanding.  Because the alternative truly really is fist-bumping while rome burns.

6831598,comment,6824685,6830738,1,0,Tohhou,,,"Grammar is how an idea is communicated. If a person has an identity they want to share then the pronouns they use communicate their identity, but if they use an uncommonly used pronoun then their identity is not understood, not communicated, and if gender neutral pronouns are used then no identity is communicated, or it&#x27;s just completely confusing as is the case with using xer. I&#x27;m fine with people inventing identities outside of the binary, I&#x27;m fine with cultures having outliers to the natural occurring roles the constraints of reality offer, because all cultures and languages developed in different environments with different forces pushing and pulling. What bothers me is the white washing of the binary male/female him/her in an attempt to represent everyone when people invent their own identities which did not occur naturally as a consequence of environment. If a culture has some instances where definite articles are sometimes out of what is naturally expected from the basic grammar then that&#x27;s cool, but it&#x27;s still not the norm. You mention because they are exceptions not because they are everywhere.<p>>, evidenced by how the ideas of “masculine” and “feminine” vary between and even within societies<p>I did say that they did vary in an earlier comment, but they still follow the biological binary. They are a product of biology. I&#x27;m talking from experience of being around different cultures and I have never been in one where men are not generally male and women are not generally female. The same gender roles also still exist, because the dimorphic nature of humans make different behaviors more advantageous for each sex to do.<p>I&#x27;m aware of things like XYY syndrome, but expression wise they are still male.<p>>third gender<p>Transpeople exist, yeah! Like in an earlier comment I also said that there is a third option in English the it, but transpeople don&#x27;t like that word as far as I know because it has a history of being derogatory as is illustrated in the wikipedia page as people being seen as without gender. They are people with gender dysphoria, because they generally would have rather been born the other gender. For whatever reason, as they developed their hormones were not at the male/female ideals and so they expressed in different ways outside of the male/female ideal ranges, and their behavior expressed in ways not common within their natural sex, so they become outcasts being not really attractive or useful to either natural sex in traditional societies. I empathize with their suffering, but I still see it for what it is. There is no plethora of varying genders divorced from sex. There is a lot of made up stuff though with no basis in science. &quot;Social science&quot; isn&#x27;t.<p>In English we do have a grammar with gender, and I know that there are generally assumptions about gender/sex which people want to change, and many I do not agree with. How far away is that from real human suffering? How serious should we really take a person who looks like a male within our culture and is offended with a person calls this person a him?<p>>It is such a different concept than classifying nouns.<p>Why reply at all to my original post then when the person I was replying to was talking about pronouns, and I was clearly using the word gender defined as an attribute of sex.<p>If you can make the world a better place with less human suffering then good luck. I see it all as being biologically informed and so useless to even bother with. This dialog is useless too. You&#x27;ve not given me any new information and I already have reflected on it all and I see it as another way. It&#x27;s not worth either of our time to continue, so, good day to you, xer.",1385958568

That there might be lawsuits and backlash even if it actually reduces the number of accidents might make it a poor play by Amazon, but it doesn&#x27;t make it a bad idea in some ethical sense. For example, perhaps you&#x27;re saying that even though it might save lives and improve efficiency, the current regulatory framework and public disposition make this kind of advance impossible (compare to cars hitting the streets in a different era). So there&#x27;s a sort of normative versus positive question here. Perhaps you&#x27;re talking about the latter, which is fine (and of course debatable), but I&#x27;m interested in the former. Especially so because the normative stuff is an input to tech policy debates and the positive stuff is its output, so you inform the debate by figuring out what the end result you want is.<p>But maybe you&#x27;re not saying that; maybe you&#x27;re saying &quot;well, we don&#x27;t know how risky drones are and maybe, safety-wise, it&#x27;s a big step backwards&quot; and the part about lawsuits and stuff was sort of a separate point. That&#x27;s true enough. The reason I gave the Fed-Ex crash example was just to point out that it does not follow from an RC helicopter accident in Queens that drone deliveries are a bad idea. But it&#x27;s true that the relative safety of cars and drones is unknown (and, as you can tell, I have a guess about it). Now the issue is that you need some way to find out. Or resign to never advancing at all. Human studies of new medicines encounter this problem too, yet few people are saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want any medicinal advancements.&quot;<p>The reality is that if you want to improve society, you&#x27;re going to have to take some risks with some unknowns. Perhaps you try it in some select cities in some limited fashion and build from there. (Think it&#x27;s unethical to experiment on humans? What about the hundred-year, totally uncontrolled experiment we&#x27;ve been conducting using automobiles? I certainly didn&#x27;t sign up for it. The status quo is not a special case.) Look at it like this: what does the world look like in three hundred years? I&#x27;d like to think it looks like something from Star Trek. So what, schematically, are the steps to get from here to there? How do you draw a line from 2013 to 2313? Because I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t involve &quot;we don&#x27;t have flying robots, so we don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re dangerous, so no flying robots.&quot;",1385958361

First, its a white collar crime. Sentences haven&#x27;t been inflated across the board for white collar crimes the way they have for &quot;poor minority&quot; crimes (that is, crimes endemic in poor minority communities). The high sentences for crimes like drug dealing are tied up with both race and class issues, and as a result 3-5 seems like a particularly light sentence.<p>Second, she&#x27;s a sympathetic character in sentencing. All sorts of factors can be used in sentencing, and they disfavor people from poor minority communities. Have a wife and child?

Our shop[1] is the most relevant fashion destination in New York today, our YouTube shows[2] are insanely popular, and we want you to help us bring our social media site to life.<p>We are looking to add two more engineers to join our team, doubling our current two (in a company of about twenty). Every engineer here will be full-stack, though we&#x27;re happy to have someone who leans to one side or the other and is eager to learn. Technologies we use include Ruby, Haskell, Angular, Coffeescript, Redis, and more. As part of our team, you will have both a strong voice in the vision and direction of our product and a good deal of autonomy and control in the specific projects you work on.<p>As for fringe benefits, we throw the most talked about parties in town (hosted by A$AP Mob and crashed by Kendrick Lamar), we have company trips to Montauk, we organize funky Soul Cycle rides with famous designers and models, and we&#x27;re invited to pretty much everything happening, culture-wise, in New York. You&#x27;ll work with a diverse group of people with a number of skillsets, all of whom - editorial, video, design - are at the very top of their game.<p>We can only consider candidates eligible to work full-time in the US who live or are planning to move to New York City at this time.<p>You can write the Chief Engineer directly at tim (a) vfiles (dot) com to express your interest.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.vfiles.com/shop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.vfiles.com/shop</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/fashion/building-blocks-all-in-a-row.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/fashion/building-blocks-al...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/05/model-files-fashion-series.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/05/model-...</a><p>[3] Our &quot;user-generated&quot; fashion show for fashion week <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2013/09/05/nyfw-vfiles-made-fashion\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thefader.com/2013/09/05/nyfw-vfiles-made-fashion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJsRvjAQULc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJsRvjAQULc</a>",1385956884

6831471,comment,6825534,6827997,1,0,lsc,,,"> So, need to fill in dates on a resume. So, if have years in grad school and some more years in a Ph.D.-only slot as a prof, then how to account for that time on the resume? If put in the truth, then won&#x27;t get hired. If just leave a gap, then won&#x27;t get hired. If fill in the gap with the jobs before and/or after the gap or something else, then that&#x27;s resume fraud.<p>If you put in a job or experience you didn&#x27;t have, or lie about the dates, sure.<p>>Likely if just omit the Ph.D. in the section on &quot;education&quot;, then that&#x27;s resume fraud much the same as claiming a degree don&#x27;t actually have.<p>This is the part I take issue with.   Me?  I leave off the &quot;education&quot; section entirely, as a high school diploma from a not very good  high school with a poor GPA isn&#x27;t going to help me any.  It takes up space in that valuable first two pages, and doesn&#x27;t convey anything that helps me.<p>But still, you /did/ get your BS, right?  Putting that on your resume is no lie.   if you put your BS on your resume, then have a five-year gap before your next job, I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s fraud, I mean if it&#x27;s true that the PhD really isn&#x27;t relevant to the job, for all the boss cares, you could have been making paper airplanes for that time, or reading about Napoleon.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen?  resume gaps are /terrible/ if they are current;  e.g. if you have been unemployed for the last five years?  yeah, you&#x27;re gonna have to work for someone like me for a few years.<p>But if you were unemployed for five years, but were employed in the field for five years after that, and now you are looking for a new job?   the big blank spot from way back when is not a big deal anymore, because the more recent five years shows that you are able to do the job.",1385956852

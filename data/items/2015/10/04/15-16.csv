The children are evenly distributed in terms of gender and the the days of the week on which they were born. If you pick one parent from the crowd, the chance that they have at least one boy is 3 / 4, the chance that they have two is 1 / 4, and the chance that they have none is also 1 / 4:<p><pre><code>      | B| G|\n    --|--|--|\n    B |BB|BG|\n    --|--|--|\n    G |GB|GG|\n    \n</code></pre>\nEach of the four squares on the above table is equiprobable. However, if the person says they have at least one boy, they must be in either the left column or the top row, so in one of three squares. There is only one square in those three with both boys, so the chance of that parent having two boys is 1 / 3.<p>Now, for the day-of-the-week problem. If you ask a parent if they have a male child born on Tuesday, it is <i>not</i> equiprobable that they&#x27;re in any of those three squares. In the BG group, they all have male children, so the chance that any parent chosen has a male child born on Tuesday is 1 / 7. Similarly in the GB group. However, in the BB group, <i>either one</i> of their children may be born on a Tuesday to satisfy the condition. The chance that either child is born on a Tuesday is the same as the inverse of <i>neither</i> child being born on a Tuesday, or<p><pre><code>    1 - (6/7 * 6/7) = 13/49\n</code></pre>\nSo the number of parents in the top left group (BB) who satisfy the condition is 13 / 49, whereas the number of parents in the top right (BG) is 1 / 7, and the bottom left (GB) is also 1 / 7. You&#x27;re looking for the probability that a given parent in that satisfies the condition is in the top left group, which is<p><pre><code>    (13/49) / (1/7 + 1/7 + 13/49) = 13/27</code></pre>",1443973938

And i spent most of my time there wrestling with the fact that the performance characteristics of local and remote calls are very different, and how that impacted design; we ended up with DTOs mirroring every entity bean to save network round-trips.<p>But the thing is, there was nothing else around at the time that did anything similar. Remote object invocation, with declarative transactions, and container-managed object lifecycles, including pulling objects out of a database on demand. That seemed like saucer tech!

I&#x27;m not saying you are one or not, just that diet is so critical to a healthy life and our &quot;approved&quot; western diet is a recipe for disaster for most people.<p>My wife is a GP and she deals with obesity and T2D all the time. She says 3 things for T2D.<p>1. Lose weight\n2. Reduce your carbs, go low carb as soon as possible. \n3. Exercise, preferably with weights and walking/swimming.<p>She personally has never had a patient that actually did the above and wasn&#x27;t &quot;cured&quot; from T2D. However, she has had folks who think losing 5 pounds or that low carb means not drinking the 5th coke of the day and don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t work in 2 weeks. She has found herself to be an educator most of all. People just generally have zero clue on how all these systems work and she has to tell folks things like &quot;yes, rice is in fact a carb. So is an apple and those waffles. Yup, the biscuit as well. Oh, you&#x27;re drinking fruit juice for breakfast thinking you are being good? That&#x27;s 45g of sugar right there. That low fat yogurt is in fact awful for you as a T2D&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t like to recommend nutrition advise over the internet, but if you haven&#x27;t looked into ketogenic diet for T2D management, I would give it a look.",1443971828

There&#x27;s expected to be a solar panel shortage coming soon because the industry is growing so fast[1], so if you don&#x27;t make your own panels, you can expect panel prices to go up. The fact that SolarCity can make its own modules, means it won&#x27;t be affected by the shortage nearly as much as others.<p>Anyway, just to give some perspective, solar panel cost accounts for ~20% of the overall installed cost in the U.S.[2]. So reducing panel prices by this incremental cost doesn&#x27;t impact the overall cost as much as you&#x27;d think. However, every little bit helps, and this definitely keeps the industry on track to meet the Department of Energy&#x27;s goal of $0.06/kWh by 2020[3]. There&#x27;s a lot of other players that are focused on driving down other parts of installed costs (soft costs are a huge part, for example), and we&#x27;re really seeing all these efforts pay off in exponential adoption of solar.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Will-There-Be-a-PV-Module-Supply-Shortage-By-the-End-of-2015"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Will-There-Be-a...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/soft-costs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/soft-costs</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/about</a><p>P.S.

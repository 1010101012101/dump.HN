Overall dev speed: initially 3, but as you dive into more complex pages that need to e.g.: retain state between AJAX calls, it moves towards a 1<p>3. Maintainability: 1. Keeping track of selectors grows to be very tricky business.<p>4. Why I chose jQuery: I started with it before the explosion of JS frameworks (and I&#x27;ve always said that jQuery started the golden era of JS that we&#x27;re in), and I would still choose it today if I need to deal with legacy sites at all.<p>I have also used ReactJS:<p>1. Time to learn: I think between 16-40 React hours to really grok components, their lifecycle and how to communicate between them. It&#x27;s a little reminiscent of components in Mobile development, but really understanding props vs state can take a while<p>2. Development speed: 2. There&#x27;s a lot of boilerplate involved (usually render, getInitalState, getDefaultProps)<p>3. Maintainability: 3. Easily the most maintainable and reusable JS code I&#x27;ve ever written<p>4. Why did I choose React? I was tired of writing code for the views in the backend (PHP) and then in JS when the data changed. React makes it easy to write once and control the lifecycle of HTML elements",1438873103

It is pure empire building and it is dishonest to dress it up as anything else. The terms of the trade deal were EU exclusivity and the termination of strong existing Russian ties. This is nothing but provocative. It&#x27;s reckless and incendiary.<p>Sure I would prefer people to have European values over Russian ones (I&#x27;m very happy we just legalized gay marriage in Ireland for example), but not like this. Ukraine is much more Russian culturally than it is European, and if it came to a EU wide referendum I would vote against Ukraine becoming an EU member. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I am part of the majority in this opinion. The EU, a project I strongly believe in, is struggling to hold itself together as it is without pissing in the hornets nest. We need stronger ties with Russia, not weaker ones. Weaker ties only bring us closer to a hot war and that will help nobody. What happened in Ukraine was a microcosm of what could happen on a much larger scale if we do not act more subtly and inclusively.",1438873091

Almost all tools which still embrace the unix way of doing things are written in C, and it&#x27;s not just because that community is conservative. C feels like unix, because it&#x27;s one of the only languages that abides by that philosophy. C-the-language is only part of the experience of programming in C. Programming in C includes DSLs and code generation and makefiles. Even what we consider C-the-language can be decomposed into preprocessor code and actual C.<p>That said, C needs to be improved, but I think it should be done via the build system, adding layers on top of C, in a tasteful, thought-out way. Some ideas below:<p>If we&#x27;re expanding on C by adding build system complexity, Makefiles need to be improved. Make is a great tool, but it&#x27;s unityped, like shell scripts. And it&#x27;s essentially a preprocessor over shell, which leads to a mess of sigils. Maybe redesigning make as an embedded language in some lisp would do it. Additionally we could unify the notion of linking to a library and importing code into the makefile to allow dependencies to specify build steps. This could make some of the added build complexity implicit.<p>Namespaces could probably be implemeneted as a preprocessor, taking module declarations and import statements and converting all identifiers into they prefix qualified equivalents, emiting warnings when there would be a collision (like if module &quot;foo&quot; declared &quot;bar_baz&quot; and module &quot;foo_bar&quot; declared &quot;baz&quot;).<p>Rust-style syntax-case macros can be implemented as a preprocessor.<p>Go-style defer statements could be implemented in a preprocessor, and avoid the somewhat verbose goto-style error handling.<p>As I said, this approach requires a lot of care to avoid adding a huge amount of complexity to the language.",1438872901

High blood pressure and metabolic precursors to type 2 diabetes are, in particular, very responsive to weight loss.<p>But even if no-one were obese, obstructive sleep apnea would still exist.  Anyone who snores could have it.  The person may have a deviate septum.  They might have swollen tonsils or adenoids.  They might have a congenitally narrow airway.  Maybe even a particularly long uvula.<p>And then there are the non-obstructive (worse) sleep apneas, such as those caused by defects in the nervous system, where the brain is unable to tell the diaphragm to move.<p>Being thin is not a perfect defense against sleep apnea.  Nevertheless, it appears that the vast majority of apneas are worsened by obesity, and obesity is worsened by sleep deprivation.  That is a vicious cycle.<p>With my foil hat on, I suspect that safe and effective treatments for reducing body fat in obese individuals are not being researched for public health reasons (esp. as preventative measures against heart disease and diabetes), because an non-curing treatment for fatness would make ten times more money than boner pills, especially in the US.  And this is why you get people doing DIY fecal transplants from thin friends in their own kitchens, or buying and injecting barely-tested research peptides (like cyclized CKGGRAKDC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 HCl salt) from Chinese synthesis labs.  The health care system wants all the money, and the people who need the treatments most just don&#x27;t have enough of it.

A few questions about Jest:<p>a. Are you happy with Jest auto-mocking? How do you keep a team from banging its head on this &quot;exotic&quot; behavior? (Typically, devs would be stuck on a test for a few hours, only to notice they failed to unmock something in the chain being tested). Have you tried the alternative of eschewing Jest and doing vanilla Jasmine, including lots of mocks?<p>b. You mention &quot;code coverage analysis&quot;. Is it working now? Last time I used it, it was broken and in need of a dependency (Istanbul) revamp/upgrade.<p>c. Do you do &quot;semi-end-to-end&quot; DOM tests (i.e. those booting a micro Selenium-like browser/js environment [1] and letting you do DOM assertions like `findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass` and others at [2])? Last time I worked with React, the team initially loved the ability to do those (as an in-between of unit tests & real end-to-end tests) but after adding a bunch of them, tests took 2min to run instead of 2s, and we were considering removing/splitting them.<p>[1] Don&#x27;t quote me on that, I have no idea how these environments work but it&#x27;s certainly not Selenium :P .

Then you can diagnose apnea from the black box data, and send a tech out to their home to adjust the fit of a new CPAP or BiPAP, to be titrated by an automated black box program.  Afterward, the black box can be returned in person or mailed back.<p>But there&#x27;s the critical problem with US health care.  There are strong anti-incentives to reducing costs in that manner.  Reducing the costs causes the providers to lose money.  Failing to do <i>all</i> the expensive CYA tests exposes the provider to malpractice complaints.<p>The standard operating procedure is not structured around what is best for the patients.  There is definitely an element of racket in it, especially if you are forced by your insurer to rent the CPAP machine.",1438871313

Throwaway phone numbers are easily obtainable.  They might not be as cheap as Mailinator, but the point is Mailinator made it faster and cheaper for people.  Buying an item doesn&#x27;t really work out when the expectation is you offer a free trial and that&#x27;s where the bulk of abuse occurs.<p>I realize this was a non-comprehensive list and I&#x27;m not trying to just attack it.  I think I agree with the core assessment around what constitutes an identity.  But short of some really draconian methods, I think you&#x27;re basically trading off one insufficient method for another.  And at that point, you may as well focus on making things easy for people, which typically means just working with email verification.<p>FWIW, when faced with Mailinator abuse I resorted to requiring a credit card number to sign up for a trial of my SaaS product.  The abuse stopped immediately.  But there were other impacts to the business as a result.  I still debate the wisdom of it and how much of this should have been foresight.  As a bootstrapped company, dealing with abuse was just a resource drain and forced me to focus my efforts on dealing with a segment of the population that was never going to give me money.

As someone who lost about about 100 lbs and kept the weight off, I&#x27;ve never really understood where this concept of &quot;fat shaming&quot; came from. I look at obesity the same way I look at smoking:<p>- They are both self imposed, chronic problems<p>- They both induce a myriad of known health issues<p>- They both are readily solvable using known methods and by building healthy habits over time<p>It is really imperative that obese people lose weight, in the same way that it&#x27;s important that smokers stop smoking. You would never say someone is being &quot;smoker shamed&quot; by being told to stop smoking, that they are being &quot;smoker shamed&quot; by being told that their smoking is causing health problems, or that they are being &quot;smoker shamed&quot; by being told that smoking is not that attractive. Why should it be different for obesity?<p>This difference makes me think that people view obesity as some inherent characteristic of themselves like race or sex. This simply does not have to be the case. I think if people knew how straight forward it was to lose weight by applying validated diet methods over time, there wouldn&#x27;t be all this nonsense and controversy about &quot;fat shaming&quot;.",1438869803

But with all the surrounding terminology and concepts, it may have taken around a week or two as I had just the afternoons.

I can&#x27;t overstate the burden this removes when you are developing a complex application.

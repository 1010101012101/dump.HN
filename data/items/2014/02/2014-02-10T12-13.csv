I took my first cs class because I was embarrassed that I used my computer like an Internet Explorer box. Barely three years later, here I am knee-deep in code with a job offer from Google. Am I an exceptional hacker? No. Can I hold my own with the &#x27;started-at-12&#x27; crowd? Pretty much.<p>It saddens me that more people don&#x27;t feel empowered to dive into a new field. Many people, especially high-achieving students, suffer from the misconception that to succeed in various technical fields, you must specialize early. Whenever an outsider expresses any interest in programming or math, I encourage them to try it. &quot;It&#x27;s too late for me,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m just not an X person,&quot; are common responses. These attitudes are caused in part by the way we STEM folks don&#x27;t bother as much with non-children. You might tell a little kid about how cool programming is, but do you even attempt a real explanation of your work with a young adult? Your uncle? If so, gold star. If not, you are only contributing to the wall between the tech-savvy and general populace. It&#x27;s never too late for someone to learn.<p>Too much stress on the early start just adds another barrier to entry for people like myself who lacked either the exposure or awareness to get started sooner.<p>If our goal is to make the tech universe more accessible, we shouldn&#x27;t be perpetuating the idea that you need a certain background to participate or excel.",1392036706

7210686,comment,7205868,7210213,2,0,e12e,,,">  think that kind of research is interesting, but feminists are prone to jumping to conclusions.<p>I&#x27;m afraid researchers in general are far to prone to jumping to conclusions.<p>> As soon as they see any data that can be interpreted to support the presence of discrimination, the case is closed and no further inquiry is being made.<p>That&#x27;s not my experience with such research. On the contrary, there are usually a progression: first look at the statistical data to see if there appear to be differences, and if there are, then try and find out more about those differences, why they are there and if they can and/or should be mitigated.<p>A lot of the work in classrooms, for instance, first started with documenting classroom settings on video, looking at the amount of time spent with various students and how often one or another group was picked to answer questions etc. This work revealed rather stark differences, much to the surprise of teachers who subjectively thought themselves to not do any sort of differentiation.<p>Now, explaining those differences is indeed complex. And while I don&#x27;t think there is any support for the idea that boys are dumber than girls (or vice versa) -- there are indeed studies suggesting that young boys have a harder time learning and concentrating in a quiet &quot;at-the-desk&quot; classroom setting. This then has implications for how one should organize class; in general you don&#x27;t want noisy students to distract those that are more quiet/more mature -- nor might you want to segregate the classroom too much.<p>> For example, in the wage gap discussion, I have never seen anybody ask an employer why they pay women less. Who knows, there might be some surprising answers.<p>That amounts to asking employers why they are breaking the law, which makes it a little tricky. In general there are three important questions here: do women earn the same as men (no); are women paid the same amount for the same work as men (no, but the difference is smaller -- especially now than in the 60s); And: Why?<p>The answer to why is also a two-part answer: partly women do more of the work that is considered free (or very low wage when people are hired to do it): housework and staying at home with children. Additionally, due to women being overrepresented in careers with lower wages, in a typical family, it makes more economic sense for the woman to stay home with young (and/or sick) children -- which again means the woman might progress slower in her career.<p>To cut an already too long comment short, have a look at for example:<p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-21/equal-pay-plaintiffs-burden-of-proof"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-21/equal-pay-pl...</a><p><a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/04/09/1839281/on-equal-pay-day-why-women-are-paid-less-than-men/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/04/09/1839281/on-equal...</a>",1392036601

7210658,comment,7207495,7209371,1,0,dalke,,,"A minor correction. Calculus has loads of proofs. The calculus taught to high school and non-math undergrads tends to avoid more than a handful of proofs because most students don&#x27;t need to know, nor care, about the actual math involved. Indeed, it would likely drive more students away.<p>I would say that calculus is the first &quot;real math&quot; that students study which is so complicated that they can&#x27;t really learn the first principles without years of effort. That&#x27;s why classes teach the most immediately useful parts instead of covering the details. Someone who only studies those basics might even come out thinking that calculus is just a bunch of techniques, without grasping how gorgeous the underlying concepts and abstractions are.<p>Take geometry as something I think you regard as &quot;real math.&quot; How come geometry classes never prove that it&#x27;s impossible to trisect the angle? Or double the cube? It turns out that compass and straightedge can only produce quadratic constructions, and Wantzel showed that these problems require cubics. This shows just how limited geometry really is, which is partially why students can feel that they have a handle on the entire topic. (Also, few if any secondary schools cover non-Euclidean geometries, or Euclid&#x27;s book X as it explores incommensurable magnitudes.)<p>I would also say that trigonometry is the first applied math course that students learn, not calculus.<p>Let&#x27;s go to calculus. Take for example the chain rule, D(g∘f)(c) = Dg(f(c))∘Df(c). This is one of those rules everyone learns in Calculus I. Can you prove it? I once could. Here&#x27;s the start of the proof from my text book:<p>&quot;The hypothesis implies the c is an interior point of the domain of h = g∘f. (Why?) Let e>0 and d(e, f) be as in Definition 39.2. It follows from Lemma 39.5 that there exists strictly positive numbers g, J such that if |x-c|<=g then f(x) is an element of B and |f(x)-f(c)|<=K |x-c|. For simplicity, we write L_f = D f(c) and L_g = D h(b). By Theorem 21.3 there is a constant M such that |L_s(u)|<=M|u| for all u in R^q. If |x-c|<infimum(g, (1/K) ...&quot;<p>And so on for another 10 lines of the book.<p>Do you really want to subject all calculus students to that level of detail? I don&#x27;t. Who other than a mathematician needs to learn about Lebesgue integration and measure theory, which are even more advanced topics in calculus?<p>BTW, my undergrad had multivariable and vector calculus as a single Calculus III class, so there were only 3 semesters of calculus before getting into the foundations of calculus. Also, calculus books do have some proofs. For example, every chapter I looked at from <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-text...</a> contains a few proofs.",1392036256

I had to edit them based on suggestions from forums. They are unversioned community efforts - poor versioning and no package manager is just a nightmare given the dozens of libraries we have to use for modern JS.<p>ii) Tooling - I thought this was the benefit and tried using it from WebStorm which claimed Typescript support. I found no meaningful intellisense only that it shelled out to the TS compiler in the background with some flakey syntax highlighting. The worst issue was that the compiler could regularly produce totally opaque error messages that were poorly located to the code issue and probably in the wrapper somewhere.<p>iii) Arbitrary apis - this is what I thought I wouldn&#x27;t face but it was. Just a single line of code trying to the most basic task of creating an express server took hours of googling for the magic incantation. Most advice referred to the wrong version.

Wrappers don&#x27;t come with documentation... even if they did, you now have to read both the original and the wrapper documentation.

Your computer lying to you is a problem in principal I think, but specifically if you&#x27;re doing any kind of sound editing/composition it&#x27;s a huge problem because now you can&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re hearing represents what you&#x27;re creating or if your os or sound card has messed with it somehow.<p>As I mentioned, Dell could turn down the input volume to their amp/speakers. It doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate the ability for a user to damage their speakers but it also doesn&#x27;t create any distortions. I would guess that&#x27;s what their bios update does. It just makes everything quieter for everyone.<p>I appreciate the principal that userland code shouldn&#x27;t be able to damage hardware, but I&#x27;d much prefer my computer not lie to me. Now, I&#x27;m also not opposed to dynamic power limiters in general.

But if things unfold like I&#x27;m hoping, this will nearly close out my mortgage; a life-changing event for a family man such as myself.<p>Disclaimer: Don&#x27;t play with money you cannot afford to lose. I have 7k that I can burn on crypto. I won&#x27;t be happy to lose it all suddenly, but it won&#x27;t put me in the poor house or ruin my daughter&#x27;s college fund. My true family funds are in e-trade.com collecting dividends &#x27;n such.<p>Overriding-rule: Never be 100% fiat or 100% coins. Be ready to make a buy or sell at any moment.<p>Back in Nov 2013 I put in 1k and the market promptly crashed afterwards so I have 26 litecoins(at $40 each) I can&#x27;t sell for a long while. I knew my luck from experience on e-trade, so this didn&#x27;t phase me - it always starts this way. The next 1k I sent into crypto-coin world is at btc-e.com where I day-trade. At first I bought and sold quickly, simply making 4 to 5 dollars. Just getting use to how btc-e.com works and its transaction speed. Then I started to make bigger and more long-term bets as I observed the big swings. It appeared to me after a few months of watching that Litecoin biggest swings are between $18 - $29. So when MtGox had its recent issues and &quot;Russia banned bitcoin&quot; pulled the price down, I bought in. I&#x27;ll make about $600 when Litecoin reaches $29 again. But on the other hand, if the price of bitcoin goes below $500, I will put in 1k for the 3rd time. If bitcoin falls below to single digit numbers[1], then I&#x27;ll buy 3k more. This brings me to my limit of having 7k in the crypto-coin world. I will now sit back and wait.<p>If we ever see $1,000/BTC after the events I describe above, I will sell everything I have - producing at least 300k. I&#x27;m done. Or, BTC will simply fall into oblivion and I&#x27;ve lost 7k.

It might be better to say that logical disambiguity is not the most important feature required for human communication (although that's much longer to say).

2635307,comment,2630867,2634083,2,0,wglb,,,"With respect to specificity of languages, Uncle Bob in ""Clean Code"" also advocates for extremely short methods in C#, on the same order as what my friend uses.  Different languages do give rise to different ideas, but I think that what matters more is how that language thinks about Objects and Classes, as one example. For example, in Smalltalk, methods are messages.  In C++ and other contemporaneous langages, nobody talks about messages.  They are still procedural chunks, more or less.  This fact has a very big influence on how programs are written.<p>Then in CLOS, you have generic methods that don't belong to a class, which is really a third view quite independent of the other two ways of looking at OO. And you get multiple inheritance without any confusion. And taking a look at those suckers, they are generally not very long at all. I have a bunch that are zero lines outside of the defgeneric part.<p>So short methods are also very evident in PGs code.  While slightly longer, they are the equivalent of the four-line smalltalk method, and brutally simple. Arc takes this to the next level.  Kind of like writing Lisp without vowels.",1307572869

They wanted to rebuild America to be easy driving dystopias with free flowing traffic and no space for community and walking lifestyles.  They did succeed in the outer parts of NYC and put freeways down both Manhattan waterfronts.<p>There used to be freeways down the Embarcadero and through the central parts of San Francisco.[2]  Tens of thousands of citizens were driven out to build them.  Their entire neighborhoods were razed and traditional walkable living was on its way to eradication in America.<p>Freeway protests started with Jane Jacobs in the 1960's, won against the freeway plans of San Francisco, and resulted in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.[3]<p>NEPA is the model for analysis paralysis and regulations and safety procedures that block infrastructure projects across America.  It continues to be necessary as you can see in most any urban freeway expansion project or wetlands infill development in America today.<p>The Big Dig in particular proves that even NEPA isn't enough to block idiocy.  The best thing for the Central Artery would have been just like the Embarcadero Freeway;  tear it down and replace it with nothing.  That is, replace it with a regular city street, a couple small parks, and new buildings continuing the urbanism of the North End.  The evidence is overwhelming that the traffic situation in Boston would have improved everywhere and the Central Artery (and its underground replacement) actually make things worse.[4][5]<p>The real insanity isn't that it took 20 years to do the Big Dig but that it wasn't simply a three week demolition project recognizing that the Central Artery was lunacy in the first place.<p>For now, however, what NEPA can do is slow down the stupidity until we can grow a planning and engineering culture that respects traditional urban form, liveable and walkable communities,  and a less motor-oriented way of life.[6]<p>[1] <a href=""http://newurbannetwork.com/article/wrestling-moses-how-jane-jacobs-took-new-york%E2%80%99s-master-builder-and-transformed-american-city"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newurbannetwork.com/article/wrestling-moses-how-jane-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_480"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_480</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Environmental_Policy_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Environmental_Policy_A...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess_paradox</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.infrastructurist.com/2011/06/06/why-building-roads-creates-traffic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infrastructurist.com/2011/06/06/why-building-road...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.cnu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnu.org/</a>",1307572754

E.g., they are going to tell the record companies how many total copies of each track have been found by the Match service.<p>That makes sense because the majority of the $25/year goes to the record companies, who almost surely use the track counts to figure out how to divvy up the money.<p>This is the first step toward the kind of system that we eventually are going to have to go to, where people pay some kind of fee or tax into a pool, can listen to whatever music they want, and the pool is split among the artists (or the companies the artists sell the rights to) according to what people are actually listening to.",1307572730

This works well when the user is expected to complete the transaction online and without changing computers or deleting their cookies during the consideration process.<p>If you have an offline sales process (where a salesperson takes an order in person or on the phone) or customers who pay by invoice, or a longer and more considered sales process (bigger ticket items), you need a closed loop marketing tool that connects your marketign leads database to the CRM that the sales team is using.  HubSpot does this, and connects to Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Highrise, Sugar CRM, Microsoft Dynamics, ACT, Goldmine, or pretty much any CRM.<p>So, Optimizely for small ticket / ecommerce, and HubSpot for large ticket / offline sales.<p>Thanks,

2635258,comment,2629519,2634065,1,0,lawtguy,,,"California sales tax does apply to all purchases of goods by California residents.  If you live in CA and purchase something which sales tax apply to, you need to pay those taxes.  Since remembering to pay sales tax to the state is a pain in the ass (not to mention an easy way to cheat on your taxes), CA law requires that merchants collect the sales tax on your purchases and send it to the state.<p>Even pre-Internet, there was a problem with this: California law can't force businesses outside of CA to collect sales tax for CA residents.  So if you bought something in another state, or from a catalog, you were suppose to report that on your income taxes and pay the appropriate CA sales tax.  Of course, no one did, but it wasn't a big deal because there wasn't a lot of money in these sorts of sales.<p>With the Internet, more and more purchases are going to businesses that are out of state (e.g. Amazon).  Since most people are habituated to having the sales tax included in purchases, they probably don't even realize they owe sales tax at all.  Or if they do, they probably don't report it since no one likes to pay more taxes.<p>So now we come to this ""nexus"" problem.  Currently neither Amazon nor its subsidiaries are in California, so CA laws don't apply to them and they don't have to collect sales tax for CA residents. This represents lost revenue for the state, but by changing the nexus rule to include affiliates, the state can get its sales tax laws to apply to Amazon and thus get more revenue.  Amazon is resisting this because it will effectively raise their prices to CA residents (of course, CA residents were suppose to be paying that anyways).<p>What actually happens if the law is passed should be interesting.  Amazon has said they will drop all of the CA affiliates if the law passes, just as they did in Illinois.  However, New York passed a similar law and Amazon started collecting NY sales tax instead of cutting off its affiliates, presumably because the hit from having to collect sales tax was less than the money that would be lost from not having it's NY affiliates.",1307571987

Though I guess I only have me to blame - I am my own worst enemy.<p>I worked on a start-up for almost four years.  It received national attention in all the popular tech blogs, as well secured seed funding.   Prior to starting up I didnt know how to code, but wanted to teach myself and I thought starting up would be a good way to learn.<p>Ultimately after the attention and money faded it was time for me to go get a job in my new field.  To get my first web dev gig was easy, as my start-up accomplishments were interesting and helped get interview/land 1st gig.  THough this 1st gig I was brought on a jr. developer making horrible money, but ended up working my butt off to go from trial period to full time with benefits/better pay.  I liked this job because it kept me busy and I always had a full plate of work.  Though a month after I was brought on full time my full plate of work shrank(my anxiety/OCD of worrying about keeping job kicked in) to a small plate. A lot of times I would send out office email asking for work(having to do this made me even worry more about me maintaining this job I liked).  I would get a small amount of work but not enough to keep me truly busy, thus I ended up taking my time on tasks .. stretching them out. Ultimately, taking my time on tasks led me to being laid off.  SO frustrating as I was cranking out stuff left and right in the beginning when I felt useful and needed.  Well I was out of work for three months, but didnt really start looking until 2 1/2 months out of work.  There again it was easy to get interview/job because my start-up accomplishments were interesting.  Well first day at this new job I immediately had those same thoughts/worries/OCD stuff - thinking this job isnt going to last.  You know what ....it only lasted six months as similar thing happened.  GOt a ton of work first few months then work stalled and thus I slowed down which ultimately led me to being laid off there for being slow  :(   Also, my worry about keeping the job continued.<p>Overall any job I enjoy and work hard to obtain I havent been able to keep due to constant worry/OCD crap.  I have had no trouble keeping crappy, boring customer service and other medial jobs, but ones that are career oriented Ive never been able to sustain.  I always worry them away whether its these web dev jobs or my NYC marketing job I landed out of college.  NYC was a place i lived only outside of college.

This time Im able to get interviews still because of background but since Ive worked for two local agencies for a short period time .. landing a gig I havent been able to do.  Some interviews have been horrible ... like one said I just wanted to meet you as your interesting, but Im not going to hire you.  Some of the interviewers personally know people ive worked for in this some what small metropolitan area.<p>I dont want to go back to medial jobs, because what the hell would that teach my future children, as well i really enjoy working on the web and feel I have knack for it.  I worked medial jobs for five years after leaving my failed marketing job out of college.  Since these medial jobs are just that and  not a career, then I do not have the same  worries/anxiety/OCD I do with career jobs.<p>Overall here I am in my mid 30s, dependent on others and like you lost as what to do.  Give up any hopes of a career and just work crappy jobs or continue to face rejection until someone else gives me another chance?",1307571497

2635237,comment,2635090,2635090,1,0,Chirono,,,"It looks like this is for a Bachelor's degree at the university of Gothenburg. From the abstract of the project report[1]:<p><i>Development of large web based applications using scripting languages such as PHP or JavaScript can be difficult given the lack of static type checking and abstraction through module systems in many such languages. We argue that static type checking and module systems can help programmers avoid common errors when developing large web appli- cations. The literature indicates that adding an extra layer of abstraction on top of the scripting languages that provides these features can be a solution to this problem.
We suggest a solution where the statically typed functional language Haskell is com- piled to JavaScript code, enabling programmers to create web applications in a modular and type safe environment.<p>An implementation of a compiler, supporting compilation of a subset Haskell to JavaScript, JSHC, is presented as a proof of concept. The compiler has a graphical interface in the form of an Emacs-like text editor extended to contain an interpreter terminal, to allow execution of arbitrary expressions. To allow for client-side compilation, the compiler is written entirely in JavaScript.
A comparison between JSHC and another JavaScript based Haskell implementation is presented, as well as some unexpected issues with the Haskell specification.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/evilcandybag/JSHC/blob/master/report/project-report-2011-06-03.pdf?raw=true"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evilcandybag/JSHC/blob/master/report/proj...</a>",1307571473

But examples like the above make my eyes hurt.<p>I suppose my question is whether you can add all the features that make functional languages powerful while also retaining static typing.  That's what Java is trying to do.   In same cases the type safety is a huge boon to building a large system with many people working on it, in others something more dynamic allows you to be far more productive.  I'm not sure you can have both and still have code anybody wants to write.<p>I haven't played much with Clojure yet, not sure if that is the best of both worlds.",1295852246

No one is saying that the platform the 4 engineers build has to be identical to Groupon's.<p>Do you know why Groupon needed a $950 million round? Because scaling the business model requires the scaling of the sales and service organization. And that requires a lot of cash and working capital. Finances are the limiting mechanism on how fast they can grow.<p>Also, their centralized sales and service organization, cloistered in their Chicago office, is not going to be as knowledgeable of local markets as natives. Local folk will always have an advantage in forging relationships with merchants.<p>The point?<p>If the platform the 4 engineers build externalizes the merchant facing function (sales/service) to local affiliates who are far better positioned to do it - and incidentally adheres to Google's own model of just being a platform - Google won't have to invest in building a sales and service organization.<p>Local affiliates would deal with the merchants, do the marketing, sign the contracts, and do all the promotional design - essentially all the stuff done by the merchant facing side of Groupon - all for less than the 50% of revs, and would then use the Google platform to push out deals.<p>The platform could follow an auction model like their current Adwords and Adsense platform.

2134447,comment,2133216,2134006,0,0,chipsy,,,"I came to the opposite conclusion. When you add perspective to game visualizations, it becomes harder to judge distances, estimate angles, make out details, and identify borders. Small items tend to get reduced to squint-inducing shapes. Large items occlude each other and cause an infuriating visibility problem. The only advantage is that it looks a little bit more like a ""real"" world, but if you're using a simplified art style, it doesn't matter anyway.<p>From a UX standpoint, the best balance is ""iconic"" perspective - most things rendered flat with low occlusion, like an Egyptian painting, much of medieval art, or Japanese woodblock prints. All the boundaries can remain clearly delineated with this style, but aesthetics can be retained through careful composition of each icon.<p>I did exactly this style for the game I'm working on. My reference points(within video games) are Ultima 1-5, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Battle for Wesnoth. In these games you are never wondering what something is, because you can always make out what it looks like.",1295849629

I was an Applied Math and Physics major my first year of college. I ended up switching to CS my second year after I had a really good professor for the Java intro class. Actually, for the mathematically inclined, Lisp can be a really fun language to learn because it's so simple yet powerful.<p>You also might want to try this:<p>1. Teach basics of programming in general (for example:  <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_2.6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for...</a>)<p>2. If she wants to learn the theoretical stuff, go over Big-O notation, sorting algorithms, data structures, etc.<p>3. Then maybe teach her the basics of Lisp and go over recursion.<p>4. Next, try a fun small project. Maybe try to make Tic Tac Toe or a Word Search solver.<p>5. At this point she would be familiar enough with CS and can tell you what she wants to work on next (i.e. learn C or Assembly to do low-level stuff, learn theoretical CS, or try making more complex programs).<p>Finally, check out these Stack Overflow answers to see what others have suggested: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3088/best-ways-to-teach-a-beginner-to-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3088/best-ways-to-teach-a...</a>,\n<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1858064/so-my-girlfriend-wants-to-learn-to-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1858064/so-my-girlfriend-...</a>",1295849037

Heavy clickers behave very differently online than the typical Internet user, and while they spend four times more time online than non-clickers, their spending does not proportionately reflect this very heavy Internet usage. Heavy clickers are also relatively more likely to visit auctions, gambling, and career services sites â€“ a markedly different surfing pattern than non-clickers.</i><p>So basically, the heavy clickers are losers who live in their parents' basements?",1202853440

114339,comment,113791,114325,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Huh. When I was in the bottom 20%, I moved to a really terrible neighborhood and ate mostly rice and oatmeal. In my terrible neighborhood, I saw lots of people who wore much nicer clothes than me, but who, uh, didn't seem to have jobs. Lots of them had iPods -- some of them also had sound systems which they used well after midnight, perhaps in order to broadcast some sort of distress signal audible at the New York Times headquarters. I have a better job now; the average income, poverty rate, unemployment rate, incarceration rate, etc., of the neighborhood I left does not appear to have improved. I did not find it very hard to live on $700 a month when that's what I had to live on. And that was in one of the more expensive cities in the world. I think they can do better, and I do think it's their fault that they don't.",1202852877

They value efficiency, so they borrow money and pay back the debt by working harder and more efficiently. I can see how investing in a refrigerator, stove, computer, and internet access would be worth it even if you put them all on a credit card at 20%; I wouldn't have a job without a computer and internet access, and I wouldn't have time to work without refrigerated food.<p>Since this chart is careful not to adjust for age, we don't know if this is a story about 20somethings borrowing to start a family, 50somethings earning a lot of money at their peak careers, and 70somethings living off of the interest in their retirement accounts. In other words, this kind of chart could portray a totally egalitarian society in which everyone earns the same amount over a lifetime, but they earn it at different times.<p>Thanks for adjusting the chart so there's no way to know that, NYT!

That was only including food, housing, healthcare, and taxes.<p>I don't think  the bottom fifth of Americans is buying foie gras and living in huge houses. Try McDonalds and subsidized housing. That doesn't even include things we would consider essentials to being a productive member of society - transportation, a phone, electricity, etc.<p>I think the savings rate of the bottom 5th probably hasn't changed much in 50 years. It's the savings rate of the 2nd and 3rd 5ths that has become completely skewed by loose credit and profligate spending (again, I wish I had the data to back up this thesis)",1202852326

Overall, I wouldn't change a thing. We now have 50K+ users, a scalable infrastructure, and full control over what happens with the site.<p>That said, I think we hurt ourselves by not looking to take _any_ capital: we spent a lot of time rearchitecting our infrastructure to scale, and we still work on the project only on the side. If we could have hired a couple engineers and worked full-time, I think we could be much further along in completing our vision. We may have even been able to do more marketing (more == any)! ;)<p>Still, to note just how cheap it is to do a project like this these days, we spend <$1000/month on our servers (colocation/bandwidth + S3), and $0/month on anything else.<p>I'd love to hear from others and to see how bootstrapping/self-funding has treated you, what you enjoy the most, what the hardest part is, etc.",1202850583

Suddenly there's a question of not just ""Who has the most charisma?"" but also ""Who can I best identify with?"" According to the states that have had primaries so far, blacks and white women overwhelmingly support the candidate that looks like them. Perhaps that's even more important that charisma?<p>At the same time, I agree with PG that charisma doesn't play as big a part in primaries.

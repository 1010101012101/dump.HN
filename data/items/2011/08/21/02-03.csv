A revolution requires an 'overthrow of a government or social order for a new system'.<p>I couldn't disagree more. Look at the impact of the iPhone. Motorola, Nokia, Palm, RIM and Windows Mobile have either changed their business, their impact on the marketplace has been greatly reduced or are out of business. This is the effect of a revolution. Had the iPhone not been revolutionary there wouldn't have been this kind of disruption in the market and it wouldn't have taken years for other OSes to catch up.<p>This is the same for the iPad.

2908359,comment,2908015,2908241,2,0,dkurth,,,"Fair enough, I re-read it.<p>I'm thinking about ""perspective"" -- the word suggests a relationship to something bigger.  For example, when an artist draws with perspective, there is a point on the horizon toward which lines extend.  Removing constraints may be a useful exercise, but removing <i>all</i> constraints would, in a sense, remove all perspective as well.  So I think I'm looking for a perspective that's constrained by what's true, rather than one that's unconstrained.<p>I guess this is what I find inconsistent.  There's this idea: ""Until we let go of our mental images of who we are or who we should be, our vision remains clouded by expectation.""  But in the same paragraph, there's a notion of ""self improvement.""  If I remove all expectations of who I should be, how can I measure my self improvement (assuming I intend to improve myself in the first place)?<p>There's the potential here to replace stressing out over a question like ""am I a good father?"" with stressing over things like ""am I nothing?  Am I improving?  Am I myself yet?""  Might this be just another ""path to insanity?""  Just a thought.",1313894629

Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you.... Worship power -- you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart -- you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.""<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178211966454607.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178211966454607.html</a>",1313892837

In stages a-b-c there's plenty of risk; after f; there's not so much. If your potential co-founder is unwilling or unable to assume a significant amount of risk, relative to yours, then they're more of an employee than a co-founder.<p>Something you'll discover is that there are plenty of people who want the ""co-founder"" title but aren't willing to assume a commensurate amount of risk. They'll tell you to go out and get the money, then they'll jump in once you've guaranteed their paycheck. Avoid these people.",1313892794

Reb Zusha answered, ""When I pass from this world and appear before the Heavenly Tribunal, they won't ask me, 'Zusha, why weren't you as wise as Moses or as kind as Abraham,' rather, they will ask me, 'Zusha, why weren't you Zusha?'

But often, they end up being mostly a way for people to spam their friends instead of people getting value out of it.  (Typically, they ask you to enter email addresses of who you think has a crush on you.  The site then uses that information to notify those people that someone has a crush on them.  So when you find a 'match' it could just be that both people entered the others' name on there thinking that they might be the one to have a crush on them.)",1313892175

One of the biggest things I've noticed (in England) is that it's very common to see boys, aged 7-16 wearing pink tshirts. Even in my childhood ~10 years ago I don't think I remember any friends or anyone my age wearing pink for it being too feminine a colour. And that's just one random thing, but that trend seems to hold true in my experience in adults too, and not just in clothing.",1313892010

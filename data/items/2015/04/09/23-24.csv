If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.",1428623956

Facebook/Parse engineer is called in to hoot about space utilisation, which is suspect as no info given as to how much data was duplicated on the Mongo replica set, but safe to assume it was at least 3 times. Which means RocksDB was 2.6x more space-efficient. Okay, but if the Mongo replica set had 5 members RocksDB is only 1.5x more space-efficient. Mongo doesn&#x27;t really optimize for space efficiency, because updates are ideally done in place and documents are normally padded to make that easier. On the other hand RocksDB is aggressively optimizing for space usage, as well as this particular case being a fresh import (no fragmentation). So it really doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of sense to crow about it, especially since it comes with a loss of redundancy.<p>I&#x27;d say some shit has been cast.",1428623742

9351782,comment,9350626,9350626,0,0,TazeTSchnitzel,,,"The problem with CS education is that many students have had experience programming (and with computers generally) during their teen years, so professors can get away with not properly teaching CS fundamentals as many students already know them, or at least enough to easily grasp the rest.<p>But there are plenty of students who <i>don&#x27;t</i>, and they&#x27;re the ones left out. They have no idea how to program, and the useless programming course won&#x27;t help them, because for the past 30 years most of the students taking it have already known how to program, so the people designing the course have no idea as to its actual quality. The professors see them struggling and assume they just &quot;don&#x27;t get it&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s this which also causes the massive gender bias in CS students: male students, to whom early (and current) computers were marketed, had learned to program at home. Female students, to whom home computers were never marketed, mostly didn&#x27;t learn to program at home. So they take the course, are considered by the professors to &quot;not get it&quot; unlike most of their male peers, and drop out: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-wom...</a>",1428623676

Now, increases in total transaction fees could potentially compensate the loss of mining revenues from the subsidy declining, if transaction volumes increase, but the average fee per transaction will always trend toward the very minimal cost for a miner to process it.",1428623425

A lot of ambiguities can be resolved with a custom algorithm of this kind. For shopping list support (where really the common cases matter most) the results are excellent. But there are ambiguities I have had to hack solutions to that would probably be better resolved via a probabilistic method.

You want to avoid OEMs trashing your computer? Don&#x27;t pretend this is about a lack of choice, or about Microsoft being stuck in the past. It&#x27;s about you being ignorant of your options, or ignorant of the ecosystem. Buy a Signature Series machine from Microsoft.[1] No crapware, no bundled &quot;features&quot; or &quot;trials&quot;. You can also go buy rebranded-Clevo-hardware built by one of their partnered system builders. These machines also aren&#x27;t full of crapware, if you pick a decent system builder. Vizio, by the way, also refuse to fill their laptops with crapware. On the other hand, anyone who owns a music streaming service is going to bundle their music streaming service.<p>As for PDFs, Windows 8 and up come with a PDF viewer since, y&#x27;know, two and a half years ago when it was released. Did you miss that? Granted the default PDF viewer is a Modern App, but it works, and it works reasonably well. I use it regularly to dock a PDF on half of my monitor while I work on something else on the other side. Office, by the way, will read and write PDFs just fine, if you&#x27;re after a more solid office-like product to do it. In case you&#x27;re about to complain that Office is too pricey, LibreOffice will do the same. If an office-suite is not your speed, Sumatra PDF exists, and is free, open, has no bundling, and is available in a portable flavour.<p>Again, this is not Microsoft&#x27;s fault. It is yours. No one is stuck in 1997 but you. You know what it requires to not be stuck in 1997? Any sort of intellectual curiosity at all.<p>> FUD? I deal with Windows issues from relatives on a weekly basis. What FUD? Am I imagining all of these issues? Spyware and adware infested boxes<p>See, you&#x27;re doing it again. You&#x27;re not dealing with &quot;Windows issues&quot;, you&#x27;re dealing with issues on Windows boxes, caused by non-Windows problems. These problems involve things like &quot;my computer illiterate family really believed there was a Nigerian prince sending them email,&quot; they&#x27;re not problems that Microsoft has introduced, and they&#x27;re not problems that Microsoft CAN solve. Stupid people do stupid things, and one of those things is double-click PORNVIAGRA.EXE.<p>This annoys me so much because you are essentially arguing that problems caused by refusing to read are problems caused by operating systems, and this really isn&#x27;t the case. This isn&#x27;t something Apple has done a better job with either, it&#x27;s just that the marketshare for Apple wasn&#x27;t high enough for the malware vendors to bother with them. Notice how reports of Apple-specific shitware have increased in the past couple years with their marketshare? This should probably point out to you that it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s solved by changing OS, it&#x27;s solved by teaching your friends and family to be more tech-literate. You are arguing that the problem of pedestrians being hit by cars when they cross without looking will be solved if we just pad bumper of the cars enough. You want to try to find a technical solution to a human issue, which computers really aren&#x27;t up to solving yet.<p>Don&#x27;t get met wrong, there&#x27;s stopgaps. There&#x27;s services like <a href=""http://unchecky.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unchecky.com/</a> which just uncheck all the checkboxes for you. Now you have checkboxes unchecked that you really need checked, and stuff doesn&#x27;t get installed properly. There&#x27;s still some reading required.<p>The point here, though, is that you&#x27;re not an idiot. Your family aren&#x27;t idiots.

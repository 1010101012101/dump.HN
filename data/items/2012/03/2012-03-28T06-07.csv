3765077,comment,3764403,3764949,1,0,ocdprogrammer,,,"In order to understand why romanians take this so seriously, you need to understand the context. Romania is an ex-communist country from eastern Europe and is widely regarded by the western Europe as poor and corrupt. On top of this, Romania has the largest Roma minority in the region ~500.000 according to wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_(Romani_subgroup). There is a lot of confusion regarding the terms: romanian, roma, romani. In the last 20 years there were several waves of romanian immigrants hitting the western europe, including the Roma minority which are highly nomadic by tradition and very visible in the west because they beg and steal aggressively and live in slums in very primitive conditions. This lead to the association romanians = gipsies, thiefs, primitives etc. The current campaign is a response to these stereotypes, which unfortunately are easily promoted in western europe especially since western mass media can't pick on blacks and arabs anymore cause that's clearly racist and open racism is not trendy anymore.",1332917731

3765009,comment,3763781,3763781,11,0,gruseom,,,"This post is spot on. It's encouraging to see one's experience reflected back from someone else. I agree with the author that the psychology of this is critical and that it doesn't get discussed much.<p>One point I'd like to add is that history gives a very misleading picture. History is divided into people who worked through hard problems and triumphed (these are called ""geniuses"") and people who either gave up or died trying (these are called ""failures""). Those seem like opposites, but it's only hindsight that makes them so. Psychologically, when you're in the middle of it, which is when it really matters, there's no way to know. All you know for sure is that you've been walking down a dark tunnel for a really long time.<p>An interesting question, more interesting than it appears, is: why would someone do that? That is, at some point, having walked down the tunnel for quite some time, the rational thing would appear to be to turn back. Why would someone not turn back?",1332915994

hence, I don't really know him. There are many people on this site that
do know him, and have worked with him, so they would definitely be in a
better position to elaborate on what PG calls ""the trough of sorrow""
faced by nearly all startups. The following link mentions it, and a bit
of searching will yield a lot more results:<p><a href=""http://www.inc.com/ss/can-paul-graham-mass-produce-start"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/ss/can-paul-graham-mass-produce-start</a><p>I don't know if PG originated the phrase or not, but somewhere in his
copious writing and speaking, he once said something along the lines of,
""One of the toughest thing for YC is keeping up the spirits of a batch
of founders going through the trough of sorrow."" --Though I've quoted
it, this is not a direct quote, and worse, off the top of my head I
can't remember the exact reference I should cite. In other words, I may
be misquoting him, and if so, hopefully he'll correct me.<p>As for me personally, the thing that keeps me going is remembering how
lucky I am.<p>Today is a great and wonderful day, but in more precise terms, I feel
good enough to be out in my little garage/office and I good enough to
type out this comment. To put it bluntly, my health sucks, and as such,
my usefulness is curtailed about half the time, sometimes more. Every
day when I can read and learn something is a good day, even if I hurt
too much to type out any notes, ideas or code.<p>I admire and even envy the people starting new companies. I may not be
able to use or afford their services, but I still admire their efforts;
they are doing something I am physically unable to do. Each of them is
taking on the amazingly fun challenge of starting a business, and I may
never again have the luxury, the drive, or the physical ability needed
to once again enjoy the challenge of building a startup.<p>None the less, I count my blessings. I have a roof over my head, food on
my table, and relative peace in my area of the world here in the silicon
valley, so I have much to be thankful for in life, but more importantly,
I <i>KNOW</i> I am very lucky. I appreciate the little things I can still do
even if they seem pointlessly trivial by comparison.<p>If you've never been thankful for the ability to simply cut the food on
your plate, let alone having food on your plate, then you are probably
caught in the mental spiral of worrying about unimportant things.<p>Today was ""Demo Day"" for the Winter 2012 batch of YCcombinator startups,
and you can be certain that every founder in the batch had many worries
and concerns about presenting their companies to potential investors for
the first time. The upcoming deadline for YC applications at the end of
the month has all of the potential candidates of the next YC batch
worried and concerned. If you are not involved in YC and have your own
startup, you also have plenty of worries and concerns.<p>The thing to remember is, as a founder you are very lucky to have these
problems to worry about. If you can learn to take a step back and
remember how lucky you are, then you'll learn to enjoy and appreciate
each and every little challenge you face.<p>I hope this helps.",1332915067

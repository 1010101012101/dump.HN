Considering it says that younger children score higher when under 12 then vice versa, IQ isn't really suppose to be changeable especially at that kind of age. <p>The social expectations on the first born may cause them to concentrate harder perhaps, who knows. And while its a large sample its from a particular source that may include systematic biases. If smarter younger kids managed to get out of military service in disproportionate numbers that would skew the results.",1192504062

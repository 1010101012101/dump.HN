Perhaps they send out a notice which includes contact information and requests specific information be provided for an ""appeals"" process of some sort (ideal).

Perhaps they delete the data automatically so there is no possible way to recover (maybe Meetup?).<p>False positives are a problem and I'm not going to get overly upset with a company when a false positive is triggered.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess you've never been involved in running/managing a huge online community(ies) with in person social interactions as the primary goal. I might be wrong, so apologies ahead of time if so.<p>Anywho -<p>It actually isn't unprofessional when the goal is to protect the members from some organizer who might be malicious in nature. There are a lot of rules and guidance around how organizers should do things, and Support's main goal is making sure the general members of Meetup aren't preyed upon. You're idea of giving a heads up, what are the parameters around before action is taken? 24 hours? 48 hours? A week? What if this post went ""i was on vacation for a week so didn't read the email, and they deleted my group, how could they!!"". It wouldn't matter. TOS are TOS.<p>If this person was malicious how much negative should the community accept? In that time how much spamming of a product the creator is trying to sell happening? How much misleading around the member base is there? \nYou need to deal with these things as quick as possible, and the TOS exists to give people the framework of usage. A violation of a TOS(on any site) is just that, and it needs to be dealt with equally across violations. Support can and will make mistakes. That's human nature. THis isn't one of those. The poster in this case was even told they could re-create the group because at this point the old one is considered poisoned, and not to be trusted. Given Meetup has been doing this for over 10 years now, I'd like to think they have these policies pretty well grounded in reality and experience.",1358700602

In fact, I'd say your points elaborate the framework defined by the author. The blog defined creativity as applying mental models and combining one's past experiences randomly to discover new connections. Your points about playfulness and curiosity fall right into this framework. One who is more inquisitive will have more experiences, and spent more time analyzing these experiences. Playfulness comes with being more prone to making random connections between disparate experiences and trying to find some underlying patterns.

WAAAAA.<p>The person who wrote this post used Meetup in the way Meetup doesn't want it's service to be used. What this person was looking for, was EventBrite, which is a fantastic site also, but geared to the idea of singular events that happen, and then go away. If the poster was trying to create a group of regularly meeting/communicating folks, to foster a true community, then Meetup would have most likely not shut them down. This is a lot different than the Vim London story, which it seems Meetup rectified after gathering better understanding ( seems like someone from community support responded to internal tooling flagging what looked like a violation and didn't understand what Vim was. Honestly, does your company's support people know what Vim is??). Meetup has a right to defend the use of their platform as they see fit, and when they do things like this its not for the one organizer who did the wrong thing, its for the X number of members who are part of groups who Meetup protects like a guard dog.<p>Meetup's support org is top notch, and they spend day and night watching an ever growing online community. When I was there we dealt with everything from Kiddie Porn Groups, Hate groups, illegal prescription sellers, pushy marketers, SPAMmers from around the world, and people who just generally wanted to abuse the trust that the platform tried to foster. The poster here hasn't posted the contents of what his Meetup group was defined as, nor has he posted the wording of the event. Note event in the singular sense, as opposed to events, or community, which is Meetup's purpose.<p>How about if you want to fling shit at a great company that serves a large user base with respect and honesty, you do the same before flinging out a ""poor me/evil company"" post without any basis for proof of your case.

Just think about what every freshman knows, and thats what you need to know.</i><p>Creativity is a function on a lot of different things at once, and is different for a lot of people. For one, it's a function on curiosity. Highly curious people tend to have the inherent drive to learn new things, new domains. This is in marked contrast to those that learn by being forced to through school or extrinsic pressures. The intrinsic learners are looking for understanding and knowledge, while the extrinsically motivated folks are striving for grades, money, societal acceptance or something else entirely. This is a very important distinction.<p>Next, creativity is a function on playfulness. John Cleese gets it absolutely right in this 30 minute talk [1]. You've got to dance around the problem, don't worry about wrong or impossible solutions, since the best solutions are usually arrived after jumping through intermediate impossibles - things and ideas that aren't realizable but make disparate connections in your brain and thinking patterns that lead to ideas that are novel and that can be realized. This is also very important. A childlike playfulness with concepts, ideas, words and humor are necessary for driving creativity.<p>This playfulness directly correlates to a lateral thinking style. ""Lateral thinking is solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and involving ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step logic [2]."" You've got to break the habits of being a rigid logician; it comes back to connecting disparate thoughts, ideas and knowledge domains in your head. This is imperative too.<p>The last point I want to make is that creativity is a process. Cleese talks about it in the video mentioned above as well, but this is very important. You can't worry about the details of implementation or the stress of time if you want creativity to flourish. Your mind needs to be unbounded and free to roam, free to explore the cosmos without being brought back down to Earth, if you will. Cleese calls this ""open mode."" When you have your great idea, you should switch to ""closed mode"" - a mode where you actually implement or create your idea, because it's fully in your head. It may take a conscious effort for a while to train yourself to get into open mode and stay there, but that's great mental training.<p>It's also wonderful to remember that creativity applies to <i>everything</i>, from acting to aerospace engineers saving the crew of Apollo 13, so the domain knowledge the author listed in the quote is good, but for sure not the extent necessary for unbridled creativity. It's also not the only factor.<p>-----<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VShmtsLhkQg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VShmtsLhkQg</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking</a>",1358698098

If you don't look at job listings for that sort of company, or your country simply doesn't have those industries in significant size, you'll see something else. I regularly see skilled embedded coders being poached with ridiculous pay rises because they're so useful and so hard to get (40 or 50 percent increase in salary upon being poached/headhunted isn't uncommon for someone a few years out of university who spent those few years learning how to code for embedded systems, but that's usually being poached between defence companies and major appliance makers - Lockheed, Thales, Honeywell, that kind of thing).",1358697848

The book had a terrific payoff idea that the movie didn't acknowledge at all, so if you've only seen the movie then you've missed the important stuff.

Then 9^9^9 (where the ^ is represented purely by positioning on paper) looks to be the best you can do.

You could get even better performance from a RAID array of SSDs.<p>Most of what people pay Apple for is sorting all this stuff out, while many of us are capable of creating all sorts of hardware stacks most people just want something fast that they can store lots of stuff on, fusion drive delivers that.<p>To consumers it's a tradeoff between price and management, and to be fair for most people an extra $250 is probably well worth it to them vs. how complex managing that storage is to them. Fusion Drive is sold on consumer surplus not commodity.<p>Consumer surplus is the same reason programmers are so valuable to the economy, industry would rather pay someone else to figure out all this complex technology than invest the time in learning it themselves and saving themselves the cost of a programmer.",1354355662

So, how do we figure out where it's appropriate and where not?<p>Properly price carbon, and remove all distorting subsidies to all forms of energy, from fossil fuels to solar to wind to nuclear. Then let the market do what it does best: figure out the best way to allocate capital to produce goods.<p>Nuclear certainly needs proper regulation and safety requirements, but contemporary designs are much lower risk than the Fukushima reactor from the 1970s or the ancient design of Chernobyl: despite that, they're nearly impossible to build. I've heard it wouldn't even be allowed, in the current regulatory regime, to replace those old plants with new ones. Something's broken there.",1354355637

Unfortunately, using thorium in any reactor today only gives marginal benefits.  The CANDU reactors in Canada can and do already take thorium in their fuel cycle.<p>In the long run, you only have to store the waste for 100 years before it is safe.  This is because you can re-use the waste, creating further efficiency and less storage time.<p>China has stockpiled thorium since 1999, and started a MSR program in the past few years.  That shows how far behind we are in this tech, even when we pioneered it (I am referring to molten salt technology).  The head of the program got a phd in electrical engineering from Drexel.  Oh, and is the son of some finance? minister as well, so it definitely has the political clout to be accomplished.  China desperately needs clean energy - they are making water plants, for coal plants, for manufacturing plants.  And each of these stresses out the environment in so many ways, it's very risky to the long term health of the region.  Visit circleofblue.org to learn more about the water-energy nexus.<p>And sorry, but not really a step closer.  Everyone in the nuke world has known thorium can be used.  Like I said before, it will only provide marginal benefits.  Did you know, thorium is 3-4x more present in the earth's crust than uranium?<p>If instead of those loans to all those solar companies, and put $50 billion to a Thorium program, and made a space race effort, I can confidently say we would be energy independent in 10 years.  Five years to develop, Five years to build.  With all these new advances in materials and alloys (which was the main issue), there would be very little problem.  Instead, we are making private companies do this, by specifically targeting military applications.<p>How sad would it be if Thorium molten salt technology was developed in the US, and we sold it overseas first?",1354354563

From final deposit, over insurance policies in case of a meltdown to environmental consequences of the entire nuclear supply chain?<p>Nuclear power is just too expensive for an economy. Nuclear power is limited, there is just not endless amount of uranium on the planet. Also globally nuclear power is pointless, IIRC nuclear power has a global market share of 6% for primary energy. Too believe it could solve our energy needs sounds weird to me.<p>Also nuclear power is inefficient. Efficiency is usually way below 50%, since nuclear power plants are far away from anything you can't usually use the heat an nuclear power plant produce for anything productive, so it's lost.<p>But of course there are new and better plants in development, they are safer and bigger and produce less waste. But the old plants still exist. You can't replace them within a few years, it takes decades. And the costs for such a programme will be very high.<p>Since 2005, there is a nuclear power plant being build in Finland, called Olkiluoto III. The reactor was priced at three billion euros, currently the price increased to about six billion. The reactor might go online in 2015, a decade after the construction started.<p>The reactor will provide 1600 MW of electrical power. For comparison, in 2011 alone wind power plants were build with the combined power of 9600 MW (Europe wide, Germany about 2000 MW, GB about 1300 MW).<p>I know, this is not directly comparable but it gives you a hint, that you could have easily get the 1600 MW in ten years with renewable sources.<p>Nuclear power might be an interesting technology, but for me it is just a steam machine, which leaves a huge pile of waste behind. Nobody knows how to handle it, and people got it wrong. Search for Asse II if you want to know more about it. For Germany it will be very hard to find a safe final deposit for all the nuclear waste.",1354354085

It required that I speak to 12 unique people during the process, and as such required 14 interviews (most face-to-face, some phone). Those were with people at the same level (architect), people above the level (a board member/leadership), people below the level (principle developers).<p>In addition to that was a 5 hour technical test that I found really good fun. The first hour I was totally stumped as to how to even begin, so I took a tea break out of frustration and nerves and found that I then completed it in around 10 minutes.<p>I found the test fascinating... a very simple thing that tested a lot of the basics in one go as well as how you might solve a very obscure and rare problem.<p>I won't share details on that test out of respect. Hiring is hard and I'm sure that they are re-using that technical test.<p>At the end I didn't get the job as I was ""too technical"" and the position was for a solutions architect and would have involved lots of customer contact. But I was offered an equivalent developer track position, though unfortunately I personally feel my strength is to always be listening to customers, so I then declined.<p>The process was interesting though. There were good questions, the interrogation of knowledge at a very deep technical level, and most of the face-to-face interviews included some technical element.<p>Because I hire too I find going through interviews to be a rare chance to deconstruct someone else's process and to try and gain an insight into what they look for.<p>I do not think that the higher level positions at Amazon would be ""no trouble"", the interviewers knew exactly what they wanted and the process was an enjoyable challenge.",1354353948

And since delta-V is logarithmic in your propellant mass (rocket equation) that could easily translate to needing half as much fuel.<p>Well, that doesn't really address my point, which was that you need to compare the weight of the hybrid engine to the weight of the extra fuel.  The first problem is that an air-breathing engine is going to be something like 3 to 5% of the initial mass, and you have to carry it with you to orbit[1].  The second problem is how the fuel scales:<p>v_hybrid = 0.8 * v_conventional<p>Assume both have similar engines:<p>ln(m_hybrid-initial/ m_hybrid-final) = ln((m_conventonal-initial / m_conventional-final)^0.8)<p>m_hybrid-intial = (m_conventional-intial / m_conventional-final)^0.8 * m_hybrid-final<p>let delta equal the expression in parenthesis<p>m_h-i = delta^0.8 * (m_payload + m_engine) = delta^0.8 * (m_payload + m_h-i * 0.05)<p>m_h-i * (1 - 0.05 * delta^0.8) = delta^0.8 * m_payload<p>So the fuel load in a hybrid is going to be:<p>m_final = delta^(1-0.2) / (1 - 0.05<i>delta^(1-0.2)) </i> m_payload,<p>The factor in the denominator is what really kills you, and the hybrid is only going to give you a net benefit for deltas less than about 15.  So, not only is there not a factor of 2 fuel savings, there isn't any fuel savings at all!  Even if you assume an engine weight of only 3% of initial mass, the benefit is only for delta < 35, which is better than just about all <i>actual</i> (as opposed to paper) launchers.  By the way, the Shuttle had a delta of about 85-90 for LEO precisely because its designers made the decision to bring wings (which we neglected above) along for the ride to orbit.  That also contributed to the 1 in 50 accident rate of that launch system.<p>And none of this addresses the fact that you are optimizing the f*ck out of one of the least expensive components of launch cost by introducing all sorts of unnecessary complexity.<p>[1] Ok, I suppose you don't, but then you have to have some way of recovering it, and that adds an enormous amount of complexity to the system.",1354353747

Regardless of the ethos of a scientist, when a scientist sets out to research with a certain goal, ""the positive effects of drinking coffee"", the only case in which the result would be unfavourable to coffee would be when coffee has no positive effects whatsoever. This is as shown obviously not the case.<p>When you research ""the effects of drinking coffee"" it seems as though you are more neutral, but in fact there is still room for bias. Will you find <i>every</i> single effect of drinking coffee? How will you decide wether they are positive or negative? how will you decide the importance of these effects? Which effects will you research in more detail?<p>This weighing and ordering depends in part on the researcher, who will have a bias.<p>Ofcourse this is not a problem when there are lots of researchers all with their own biases, together they will paint a full picture. But if you only fund those researchers who have the kind of bias you like, then that full picture might be skewed (this is called publication bias: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias</a>).<p>In this case people worry if the coffee research institute has hired biased researchers, rewards only the researchers who publish good things about coffee or even publishes selectively.<p>So it is a good thing to point out.

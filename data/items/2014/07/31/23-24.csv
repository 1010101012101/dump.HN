I did this for the first time perhaps ten years ago, and here&#x27;s what I found.<p>Firstly, the degree of marketing bullshit that you have to push through just to get to the truth of the APIs is <i>staggering</i>.<p>Secondly, they perform backflips to avoid telling the truth about their integration options, which is to say that they&#x27;re all fundamentally insecure for real time digital goods and services <i>unless</i> you implement IPN plus polling plus duplicate detection / additional round-trip validation calls, ie. you can&#x27;t trust an IPN notification. The degree of complexity (order state tracking, IPN state tracking and duplicate detection, retry support, running your own IPN-receiving server) and latency requested here of client businesses is immense.<p>Thirdly, their idea of international support is pathetic. It seems that they&#x27;ve basically duplicated their entire business process to other countries, translated it, and then assumed that everyone in that country requires only one human language in all of their interactions: documentation, support, emails, etc.<p>Finally, as is widely known throughout the industry they have a shocking reputation for the arbitrary suspension and seizure of accounts and assets, with little to no recourse for those affected.<p>I am not surprised that Stripe has taken off.

Besides, after trying 1password, lastpass, and a few others, the browser integration was usually a source of frustration instead of convenience.<p>For my setup, I have a keyboard combo mapped to an Automator action that gets the current URL from Safari, passes it to a shell script that strips out the hostname, then uses pass to copy the password to the clipboard for 45 seconds.  Then, I use another script to have a notification pop up with my username in case I&#x27;ve forgotten it.  So I press &quot;cmd+\\&quot;, then a second later I have my password in the clipboard and my username showing on a temporary desktop notification.<p>I&#x27;m also using pass to store bank credentials, software keys, and other things.

For example, changing things like &quot;top&quot; on an absolutely positioned box can trigger reflow of the contents inside, because of the way CSS works (for example, if &quot;bottom&quot; is set, then the height changes, which can affect the size of things with percentage heights, which can cause floats to be repositioned, etc. etc.)<p>In traditional browser engines it&#x27;s even worse because layout runs on the main thread, which is also shared with your JavaScript, so painting ends up transitively blocked waiting for your scripts to finish. That is not the case in Servo (disclaimer: I work on Servo), but making layout run off the main thread is hard for many reasons—some inherent to the problem, some historical in the design of current engines—so all current browsers run JS and layout together.",1406850584

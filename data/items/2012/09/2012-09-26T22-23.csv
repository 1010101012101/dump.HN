To counter their fear, companies make their standards too high and turn down people who would be great at their jobs. ... Everyone wants the next Steve Wozniak to walk through the door, but really, they should be asking to see if they can do the job.  They want to populate their entire staff with engineering geniuses, and you dont need the whole staff to be engineering geniuses. You need a couple really bright people who know what theyre doing, and then, just dont turn down people who can do the job. </i><p>There's definitely a misconception out there that a company can make it on ""great engineers"" alone.  I've been thinking about this lately, trying to come up with a good way to describe to people what I do.  So far, the best thing I've been able to come up with is that it's akin to being a load balancer: the person who takes on the tasks that can and will be optimized, but that are (for whatever reasons/ priorities) not yet able to optimized.<p>So maybe part of ""the engineering shortage"" is related to the shortage of people with enough technical competence to take on the tasks that the engineers <i>could</i> do, but don't want / like to do.  So far in my experience, I've seen far more of a dearth of support people who know what they're doing, than a shortage of good engineers.",1348700377

It's interesting that he describes finding engineers as like ""detective work"". My first instinct (as a developer) is that if someone is difficult to find, it's quite possible that they're not interested in being found. If they were looking for a job, they'd be visible. Does he consider it his role to 'educate' engineers about the possibilities available to them?<p>I've just been through the process of finding a new job. I expressly avoided using any recruiters, and am very happy with the result. Maybe engineers are hard to find because they're used to hiding from recruiters. I negatively judge startups that use recruitment agencies, but maybe I'm part of the problem.",1348700202

4578444,comment,4577133,4577800,1,0,zmitri,,,"I agree, there are a lot of people who don't learn that well like that. Visual programming makes it a bit more approachable but whether or not it helps learn beyond the first couple lessons (or is overkill) -- I'm not sure. With a lot of these early concepts I feel like just getting one or two reference points can start a snowball effect. Eg. Tell a philosophy student that object orientation is like Plato's Theory of Forms.<p>From personal experience however I still would argue that just building something is the surest way to go because it requires you to follow through.<p>After about 2 years of programming full time, I started to develop a sense of why and when things would go wrong up and down the stack, and I don't really think it's something you can teach. It's something you get from loads of accumulated practice -- eg. Oh that's how indices work in Oracle vs MySQL, dynamic proxies on Groovy methods don't work when called from Java, I just built this but now I see I can refactor and save tons of code next time, what are <i></i>kwargs in python, etc.<p>I've tested out little one offs like try mongodb, try redis, or interactive js tutorials, but I forget what I've just learned until I need to build something on my own.",1348700183
4578443,comment,4578059,4578059,20,0,lilsunnybee,,,"I really like this article. There are a lot of unconventional candidates out there that could do great work if any established business or startup would give them a chance, but since they're not the perfect resume candidate, or close to it, they can't get in the door to show their chops. It's basically classism, because the candidates most likely to have that perfect resume or flawless work history would have come from a privileged background, where they had all sorts of resources available to them, were never forced to get a job outside their field to earn a wage, and were never hurting for connections.<p>Take me for example. I graduated in 2008 with a computer science degree from a pretty good state school. I resigned from my first job after feeling extreme burn-out and anxiety from a broken process and constant missed deadlines.<p>If you have any gap in employment though that throws up huge red flags for a lot of employers, as well as being anxiety prone and not interviewing so great because of it, or not being fully knowledgeable about whatever particular software stack that business is using.<p>And i know you can lie on a resume but some of us aren't so comfortable doing that. So it ends up if you have any red flags, you're basically never getting employed again. Fired unfairly from your last job: good luck explaining that one. Family or personal emergency create a hole in your resume: that's not gonna look good. Have other concerns that take up your free time besides building up your Github: you must just not be dedicated or in love with the field (which is not the same as not being able to do the work).<p>I sort of long for the early days of programming back when you could just walk in the door and take an IQ test with an employer to see if you were capable of being a programmer, regardless of your current / past employment, personal history, etc. Now to do any sort of work you have to have already done the work, which is exceedingly difficult if you are currently working full time in a different field (out of financial necessity), and aren't a lone white bachelor who has loads of free time to spend on personal projects.<p>So what do i do now: i clean houses. It's fine work if you have nice clients, but i'm also underemployed and very low income. It's easy to get discouraged about even trying to interview, when you're pretty sure once they see your resume, any effort you've put in would have been a waste. No one seems to want to hire a housecleaner as a programmer (classism), regardless of my education, high SAT / GRE / college GPA. I'm damaged goods, and it doesn't matter if i can do the work or not, i'm just not an attractive candidate.<p>Sorry for the rant. But i can't be the only one out there. I bet there are a lot of capable workers out there that are either unemployed or underutilized because of discrimination of one type or another.",1348700171

Since the fill color is an implicit global variable, and not exposed anywhere in the interface, there is no way to discover its existence or behavior except via trial and error or reading the documentation. If the fill color were either exposed via the programming interface, or were explicit, then no meta-knowledge would be required to use it.<p>Similarly, the heap size limits in Java are global limits implicit to the system, not to the program being designed. His solution to the larger problemdata growing beyond available resourcesmight involve providing a better visualization of the data. Something more responsive than the feedback loop provided by heap limits. Getting an OutOfMemoryException doesn't help you to understand how the data grew beyond expectations; it is always followed by a heap dump.

That's great when you are teaching programming and you control exactly what the problem is and what the IDE does for that problem. But this is presented as a solution for programming in general (see the section ""These are not training wheels"", e.g. ""Maybe we don't need a silver bullet. We <i>just</i> need to take off our blindfolds to see where we're firing."").<p>The control flow visualisation works great for toy problems when learning programming, but quickly breaks down in the real world. The iteration counts become too big to see anything. If you are working with functions that can be sensibly plotted when the iteration counts get too large that's great, but 99.9% of code is not like that. You're working with billions of seemingly random integers, or with strings, or even more complex data structures. How are you going to visualize that over time? Probably for each problem you can come up with an adequate mini-IDE, but that doesn't really help because implementing that mini-IDE is more work than solving the original problem in the first place. To make this practical you need general purpose tools with easily customisable visualisations (and IDE interactions in general).<p>Another example is the UI for the bouncing ball. Displaying the trajectory of the ball faded out like that works great for an animation or a very simple game where a single thing change over time, but how about a more complicated game where the entire screen changes every frame (as in most 3d games and even side scrollers). That's not even considering GUI applications!<p>This type of visualisation is also highly specific to single imperative loops, yet the author agues against that. How do you visualize a program structured functionally? You can try to do something with an unfolded expression tree, but that quickly gets out of hand too.<p>All the examples in the post fall into the category ""drawing a very simple 2d scene with at most a singly nested loop"". How big a subset of the field of programming is that? It's also no accident that the author chose <i>that</i> subset: it is the easiest case for this kind of visual interaction. Don't fall into the trap of extrapolating the results to all of programming, and thinking we are almost there and the problems lies just in implementing this kind of IDE. While this is superb work, 99% is still to be discovered.",1348698210

This is why Rust feels like vaporware (especially compared to Go).<p>People like to compare Go and Rust, and I think the comparison is pretty natural. The difference is that Go already has ""boots on the ground.""<p>If Rust releases something awesome in the next few months, the gap between Go and Rust could rapidly close (depending on developer adoption). But, in my mind, the longer Rust takes to iron out the quirks of it's syntax (not implementation, syntax!), the wider that gap will get.",1348697796

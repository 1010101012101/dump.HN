Good HTML, page structure, and tagging is a bit of an art, but business as usual to any top flight developer.<p>The elephant in the room with SEO is paid links. You may have a wonderful validating, user friendly page, but if your competition has 1000 backlink lead on you, you'll never see the top SERP spot for big keywords. Viral content can certainly help, but the unpredictable nature (esp of the links) tends to keep it in second place.<p>I think most programmers consider paid links 'beneath' them, and most marketers don't understand it (and technically it's grounds for a google ban, but that's only in blatant cases in my experience), but in reality:<p>1) Identifying proper backlink candidates, in your niche, and tracking contact info down<p>2) Crafting a non-spammy pitch, and following up on it<p>3) Making a deal, optimizing the link, and keeping it up to date<p>is not only a skill set to be mastered, it's a full time job for any site of large size.<p>Of course throwing down a technically sound site with good content is job #1 for any of us, but the idea that that alone will get you traffic, especially if your idea isn't novel/brilliant, is awfully optimistic. We all want to be Twitter, but somebody out there is getting rich selling wrenches, and the publicity/viral opportunities take real work to master.<p>Finally, many of the services good SEOs offer like advanced site analytics, integration with PPC campaigns, etc, can be major ROI gainers.  They're not necessarily SEO, but they tend to fall under that community's expertise.<p><i>whew</i> All that said, I too believe that 80% of the SEO experts out there are hawking snake oil, or black hat google-bomb of the month stuff that will have negative repercussions, but the idea that the whole industry is bunk comes from a large number of people that either all have a brilliant, novel idea, or are missing a serious ROI opportunity.",1225151745

I've been avoiding getting involved in the generational battle that seems to have been sparked here over the past week, since I didn't want to add fuel to the fire. But this comment struck an unhappy chord with me; it just seems a bit too indignant.<p>I think the problem I have is that the assumption it is based on is wrong. I can only speak as a representative of the millenials, but the motivational power you have identified is incorrect. I am not working off of the assumption that everything I do ought to be fun. Given the discussion I've observed here so far, this seems like a gross exaggeration of what has been said.<p>The primary motivation for me is to be productive and build things people find useful. It seems that this is the same primary motivation of the original poster, too. If things are uninteresting, if they are laborious, if they are maddeningly menial, but they need to get done, then I have no problem getting them done. If, above all of that, they are pointless or otherwise seem like a counter-productive waste of time, then I will get demotivated, and my productivity will slow. As a result of my productivity slowing down, I will become unhappy and start asking questions similar to that of the original poster. I like getting things done, and when I feel like Iâ€™m running in place, it begins to make me ask why Iâ€™m not just standing still. Your position on this seems to be that I should shut the hell up and just keep running, if I know what is good for me. Can you be so kind as to explain why it is good for me, or those who have ordered me to keep running?<p>Obviously, if fed with an endless stream of menial work, my motivation will suffer as well, but I suspect that is not where the original poster is at right now. If it was, would you still be yelling at him to suck it up and get back to work? At what point do you decide that there really _is_ a field somewhere else with greener grass? I hope you are not so cynical as to say the grass everywhere is indistinguishably parched.",1225148596

Caching images instead of generating them on the fly is pretty low hanging fruit.<p>(yes, I made up a 90/10 rule just to make my argument sound better).",1225148549

I wanted something unique that would get people's attention and return unique content when searching. I also thought it was funny. People need to lighten up a little bit if the name bothers them. It's not like I put the name ""authgasm"" in helpers that you have to use all over your application. It sits in your plugin dir, that's all.<p>Anyways, regarding encryption. You can encrypt the password any way you want. Use bcrypt-ruby if you want. It would take no time at all to set up. Checkout the acts_as_authentic documentation. You can provide your own ""crypto provider"" and have it do whatever you want.<p>Lastly, I don't use Sha256 straight up. I add in salt. So reverse lookups are out of the question. Your last option is brute force. There is no encryption / hashing algorithm that is safe from brute force. Granted some might slow it down more than others, all that is doing is setting up more hurdles to jump, not 100% secure.<p>But I really like bcrypt, I'll look into it and maybe switch it to the default crypto provider. But, I really think for anything that is not being used in the NSA, Sha256 + salt would work just fine.",1225148525

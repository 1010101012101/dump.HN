1498932,comment,1496683,1497187,0,0,iuygtfnh,,,">it seems to me the issue would be whether writing the code for patented software constitutes ""making"" it.<p>That's the problem with software patents. The patent must be published - that the whole point. \nBut in software writing down the algorithm is also making an implementation. It's like the pornography laws that defined looking at an image on a computer screen = producing an image and therefore equivalent to being present when the act took place.",1278626388

Part of the reason why is that there are so many ways to do it, because I don't put everything in Emacs.<p>I use a Mac, running various web browsers, Mac apps, Vim, Emacs, and connecting to Windows over Remote Desktop.<p>I use:<p>* Cmd-Tab to switch between Mac apps. Even works if I'm fullscreen in Windows: Cmd-Tab and I'm back to my Mac browser.\n* Cmd-~ to switch between Mac windows. Scoped to the current app, which helps when I have lots open.\n* Cmd-Shift-[ and ] to switch between Terminal tabs. No worries about the shell catching those keys.\n* Option-Tab to switch between windows within Windows.\n* gt/gT and the Ctrl-W keys to manage tabs and windows in Vim.\n* etc.<p>Notice how I have various levels of switching? I don't have all of my tasks on the same flat plane, so I can switch between groups easily. Vim and Emacs end up as task-specific interfaces; I don't have to worry about getting my IRC client out of the way when I want to edit a few files, and the shortcuts to get to my browser is disjoint with the ones I use in my editor.<p>Somehow all of these are internalized, so the complexity doesn't really affect me. I just notice how easy it is to get to what I want across multiple OSes and apps.",1278626348

Bonus points if the project is something that takes advantage of what the language is best at, or what the culture focuses on.<p>For instance, I recently wanted to learn Clojure, so I chose a project that involved a lot of multi-threading related to a topic I'm very interested in. It's been about a week, and I feel very comfortable in the language.<p>In the past I've tried learning from books, etc... but when I need to apply the knowledge, I find myself referring back to what I read entirely too much. By having a specific project I'm trying to accomplish, my learning is directed. I'm learning solutions to problems that I already understand and appreciate. This way, you understand a lot more about the reasoning behind the language, and the way it should be applied. By just reading cold, you miss that entire aspect.",1278626120

Smile at the cashier at the grocery and say something simple e.g., ask how the day is going.<p>You will sound dumb, stupid, and inane to yourself for a long time (but probably not to other people).

I could perhaps rightfully (based on user-base) argue that wordpress/tumblr has intuitive interface, Awesome iPhone application, bigger and very active community, easy of use and works out the box (which one doesn't work of out of the box?).<p>Whats so unique about these qualities with posterous?<p>>It's not aiming for the serious blogger. It's the easiest way to post stuff online. The rationale is most people aren't tech savvy and there are tech savvy people don't care about whether the index should have 8 or 10 posts, whether the date is YMD or DMY. It's for people who want to just post stuff online easily and share it with others.<p>You repeated exactly what I said. But there are also some serious tech-savvy users also using posterous. Which makes me think that they have some good marketing ideas and got these guys to throw in some blog posts on posterous so that others will think <i>""wow, so and so is using posterous, it must be cool or something. Must be the new fad""</i><p>Reading my own comments, I feel like I am coming across someone who has something against posterous. But honestly I don't, its just yet another blogging platform and if it wasn't funded by YC we wouldn't see it so often here on HN or even talk about it.",1278625868

For example, search-and-rescue efforts are often expensive, and taxpayers bear much of the cost.  Some jurisdictions require backpackers and others who might end up needing those services to pay for permits, some of the cost of which goes to support search-and-rescue services.  One can argue that that means careful backpackers end up picking up the tab for imprudent backpackers, but I think that's preferable to asking <i>all</i> taxpayers to pay the cost.",1278625863

This isn't unique to reporters, many professions share a certain ""tribal"" (for lack of a better word) outlook.

This would dramatically reduce the influence and status of reporters, which is why the journalistic mainstream does not directly [1] reveal their views.<p>[1] They reveal their views indirectly, by their choices of what to cover and some implicit assumptions.

There were little problems with messages getting resurrected as ""unread"" even after I'd read them, and composing a message meant my ""drafts"" folder got pounded by incremental saved messages every 30 seconds, but whatever.<p>Then I tried to find a web browser that runs in Emacs and will display pages properly, not in the broken Links/Lynx way (with or without pictures). No dice. Oh well.<p>Then I started using IRC and my IM clients in Emacs. They worked ok, but it was around this point that I started to realize what an incredible pain in the ass it is to manage buffers in Emacs.<p>To start with, you never <i>really</i> have enough space on screen, so a lot of the buffers end up being hidden. Ok, whatever, but then you realize it's a hassle to even switch over to a different buffer, with the M-x b type-some-of-the-buffer-name dance, since you can't keep them all on-screen to switch around with C-x o.

There's a lot of those little details throughout the site that doesn't make for a great user experience.<p>Also, I think you need to switch the focus to reading, as others mentioned. Interesting content is what's going to get people coming back. So the front page should show the most popular links instead of people. I actually think this page (<a href=""http://www.howl.com/explore/all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howl.com/explore/all</a>) should be the home page. I think that would make a much more compelling first experience, and you should be able to get there without needing to sign up.

Documents, email, maps, news, phone/voice, search, videos online, and soon television.<p>I think that there's still a long, long way to go.  I run into information problems that I can't solve with Google all the time, mostly relating to obscure niche interests.  Are there really <i>no</i> people talking about my favorite books on the Internet?  Because unless I want to talk about Harry Potter or Twilight, I can't find any.  Has <i>nobody</i> run across this error message that I just found in my Haskell/LLVM program and solved it?  Of the dozen or two restaurants within a mile of my apartment, only about half of them show up on a Google Local search.<p>Google does really well for popular stuff, basically anything with a Wikipedia entry.  It's still remarkably immature for things that are very niche, when there's just a handful of people around the world interested in that topic.<p>Udi Manber, Google's search VP, had an interesting interview about that:<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9960259-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9960259-7.html</a><p>> ... and to sell ads based on that information. Google is still primarily an ad company that just happens to also do technology that helps them sell more ads.<p>Honestly, working in search, I don't see that.  I'm explicitly told <i>not</i> to worry about revenue or ads.  There are other departments that handle that.<p>I think that the way the founders view it, Google is a technology company where ads give them the wherewithal to build interesting technology.  It's the old Drucker view of a corporation: profit is the <i>cost</i> of staying in business.  A business exists to fulfill a social function; the profit motive exists to keep the business honest, so that it doesn't consume more resources in pursuit of that fulfillment than it generates.",1278623648

Where I come from (Ireland/UK) there are lots of betting shops - mostly catering to sports betting, but you can walk in and ask for odds on anything, such as the outcome of a forthcoming election or whatever. Casinos are no big deal (though they cater mainly to the better-off) and most pubs or other social spots have a slot machine or two.<p>Of course, some people are compulsive gamblers and experience problems as a result. On the other hand my local 7-11 (24 hour convenience store) attracts gambling addicts too, one guy shows up there once a month and hangs out all night playing a quick lottery and smoking two packs of cigarettes. For a while I thought prohibition policy existed because the state wants a monopoly on lottery revenue, but state lotteries seem to be just as profitable in Europe as they are here despite the much lower payouts. The rates of gambling addiction don't seem much different.<p>I have virtually no interest in the pursuit other than buying a lottery ticket on a whim maybe once a year, but it's similar enough to video gaming that I can see how people get hooked on it - probably something akin to a dopamine deficiency.

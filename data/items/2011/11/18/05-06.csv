I've seen the same thing from the programming side. Unfortunately, an unskilled programmer can create more and longer-lasting damage than an unskilled QA tester -- some code sticks around for decades and has layers and layers of new code built on top of it. Thus, bad programmers can drag down other programmers' productivity long after they've left the project.

3250685,comment,3249678,3249678,15,0,da-bacon,,,"A very interesting paper (I used to work in quantum computing, so I think I understand the paper pretty well after reading it a few times.  Like most foundations papers is deceptively short!)<p>The basic idea is fairly simple.  From quantum states (the wave function) we can determine probabilities of outcomes when these states are measured in different manners.  A major problem in quantum foundations is how to understand these probabilities arise, i.e. where do these probabilities come from?<p>For example, it could be that the probabilities arise from our ignorance of knowledge of the system (these are what people traditionally call hidden variables.)  Imagine a hard disk with a bunch of information on it.  If you don't know all of the bits on this hard disk, then your computer can act in ways you can't explain because you don't know all of the bits.  Each time you setup your system and run a program you may get different results because that extra information on the hard drive could be different, and so because you don't know all of the information you will see probabilities of outcomes.  Mystery solved.  Coming up with such a theory however currently always runs into a problem with locality.  But that's a story for a different comment thread...<p>Here is what the authors ask.  They say: well it could be that all of the information that is specified in a quantum wave function is all that matters, that is for each quantum state there is a one to one correspondence with a configuration of the hidden information (they allow for extra information, but that's basically irrelevant.)  That is, literally, the quantum state is written on your hard drive in all its glory detail, and each quantum state is distinguished for any other quantum state.  Contrary to this it could be that the information overlaps in some way.  That is for different quantum states, some of the bits, say, will be in the same configuration.  The authors then go on to show that this later assumption isn't compatible with the predictions of quantum theory (and show an experiment that can be done that will verify that the later interpretation is not correct.  If the experiment fails, then quantum theory is wrong, and all hell will break lose.  Assuming quantum theory holds, this shows the second interpretation isn't viable.)  Very neat.<p>There are a couple places where the argument seems a bit odd to me.  For example, it is really not clear to me why the measurement device in their system has to depend on the portion of the information that is shared between different prepared wave functions.  If this information is ignored by the measuring device, I don't see how their contradiction will arise.  Of course it self tells us something kind of interesting because it puts a limit on how shared information is revealed to a measurement device (this seems almost Kochen-Specker theorem like.)",1321593187

My address is in my HN profile.)<p>> women's self-reported happiness levels<p>There's that word, ""self-reported"". There are a lot of pitfalls to self-reported data, and many of them apply here. Women used to be openly discouraged from displaying negative emotion because it would make them unattractive, or bad wives.<p>Arguing in the alternative, it's also inconsistent that you mention this point in the first place, because of your earlier criticisms of ""hedonism"". Career-focused today might be lead busier, more stressful lives compared to the lives of housewives, which is a loss for hedonism and perhaps a loss for ""self-reported happiness"", but doesn't it fulfill higher virtues?<p>> I also question the assumption that all those extra marriages ensured by the non-acceptance of divorce were necessarily unhappy.<p>I don't think they were necessarily unhappy either, but there was simply no good, acceptable outlet for the ones that <i>were</i> abusive or unhappy.<p>> The culturally-enforced economic dependence of women on men probably would be unworkable, but that's not what I'm arguing for.<p>One of the reasons women can have careers is because they can delay marriage, and one of the reasons women can delay marriage is because there are socially acceptable sexual outlets other than marriage.<p>> I just think that people would be happier in a society more oriented towards family formation than our current one.<p>Among people I've known, the ones who were having premarital sex between 16 and 25 still got married and had kids between 21 and 30. Having kids seems to be something people naturally want--you don't have to trick them into it by trying to withhold sex from them.<p>I guess you could add social pressure for people to have kids, so people who didn't actually want kids felt forced into having them anyway. But I've known people who were raised by parents who didn't actually want kids, and they seem more adamant than me that people shouldn't have kids unless they really want them. That's what it's really about--personal freedom.<p>> All I'm doing is criticizing our present time and its prevailing values.<p>No, see, you're criticizing it from the perspective of the past, and you are saying the past was better at least in some ways if not in others. I'm trying to show that the ""bad"" things about the past--the things we can agree were bad--are intricately linked with what you think are the ""good"" parts. And I'm criticizing our present time and its prevailing values too, but from the perspective of a possible future where everyone is perfectly okay with consenting adults safely doing whatever they want with each other.",1321592989

2707306,comment,2704979,2707025,1,0,slowpoke,,,">So in short, mathematics saves you time by expressing common patterns or ideas.<p>I wasn't arguing that. In fact, I said that math is lending me and students of other fields tools to use and apply. The problem lies in the expression of said tools (which is exactly what I mean with ""arcance notations"") and the inability of many mathematicians - no offense - to separate those two concepts (tools/mechanics and expression) from another. They assume that they are completely inseparable, which is not only part, but a major source of the problem. Any attempts to somehow make math less obscure (or even just suggest it) is met, in great parts, with conservative hostility. I've seen mathematicans claim ""that I was telling them that their profession is pointless and should be abolished"" when all I was saying that a majority of the expression of math is incredibly obscure/arcance to most people which are not mathematicians and mostly not suited for practical appliance (as in, appliance in fields of science other than math).<p>Also, it's a valid point to say that we shouldn't have special syntax/language for every appliance of math imaginable. That would indeed not only be stupid, but actually /increase/ obscurity. We should, however, stop excusing the obscurity of math with ""it's shorter to write"". Readability and - most importantly - comprehensibility should /always/ come before convenience. Even in math.",1309294769

Amazon has already said they are adding ePub support to Kindle. ePub is already the dominant ebook format for interchange (I don't consider PDF to be ebooks).<p>If Rowling were to sell her books on the iBookstore, they would be every bit as much ePub as if she distributes them herself. What's more, the iBookstore doesn't mandate DRM, so even the argument that she's doing this in order to promote DRM-free is a red herring.<p>Sure, by all means distribute the ePubs yourself. Rowling can publicize DRM-free ebooks using the ePub format. But there's no reason for her to avoid also selling her books on the existing bookstores. Let the consumer choose which place to buy their book from. The only reason that makes any sense to avoid selling on the iBookstore is a desire to avoid giving the 30% cut to Apple.

You don't even have to use Scrapy's built in processor, you can use BeautifulSoup (or whatever else) if you want.  What Scrapy gets you is all the logic for crawling of the web pages (requesting pages, reacting to html errors, etc.).  You basically just tell it what urls to parse, what to parse from the pages, and what to do with the parsed data.  It handles all the rest.

There are certainly many such cases in copyright law where things are obvious and the result of a court case clear in advance to those knowledgable of copyright law. This is not one of those cases, it is more subtle.<p>The work is derivative, but he claims it is not a copy that has been filtered with an algorithm, he hired an artist to recreate it pixel by pixel by hand. Thus it's like an impressionist painting of a realistic photo. A substantial difference. Is it fair use? Fair use looks at many things not just one. Given that it's transformative to comment on what is being done to the music as well, and it's a non-commercial project (income went to pay costs and remaining profit went to charitable something or another), it might be fair use.

If that's still too hard, you can do push-ups with your hands on a raised surface or even against the wall. Similarly, if the recommended weight for something is 135 pounds, no one will look down on you for using 85 pounds or 25 pounds if that's where you're at.

  9 pullups
  9 burpees
  200m run
</code></pre>
If you don't have space to run, you can jump rope, and if you don't have someplace to rig up a pullup bar (unlikely!) you can do rows with something heavy.<p>Or you might do the following as many times as possible in 15 minutes (in Crossfit lingo, AMRAC -- As Many Rounds As you Can):<p><pre><code>  10 deadlifts
  20 wall balls (throwing a medicine ball against a 10' target on a wall)
  400m run
</code></pre>
After the workout, you record your time or number of rounds and the weights you used for each exercise.  The numbers motivate you and allow you to measure your progress if you repeat the same workout every couple of months.  For me, it helps a lot to have the measurement in mind while I'm working out.  The harder I work, the better the numbers I get to write down afterward.<p>You can do this on your own, like I said, but for some people the pressure of performing in front of other people helps a lot.  It's certainly true for me, even though I'm completely the opposite when it comes to mental work.  Having instructors is good, too.  They'll push you to pile on the weight or ease back on the weight as appropriate.  If joining CrossFit is impractical or unaffordable, and you can't talk your friends into working out with you, competitive sports can serve the same purpose of providing motivation and measuring improvement.",1309293867

In general in Northern CA, the actual zoning people don't care about violations of home office -> office as long as it's not causing trouble for others -- there are numerous examples (Facebook, HP, ...) where homes have been used as offices.

I could lean in to whisper with a friend here and there, or even put on some face paint and huddle together with like-faced friends to form a group. But everyone could still see me, and I could see them  I just had to peer down the field. I can't <i>really</i> say things to my group that I'd normally say in private because with all these people on the field with me, someone would certainly overhear us!<p>With Google+ the structure is different. Rather than a field, it's more like a big building with many rooms. Each room can be decorated and tailored to a specific group of friends who hang out there. Best part is once I'm in the room, I can close the door and be myself! I can go up two levels, change hats, and walk into a different room.<p>tl;dr Google+ lets me fully engage my various social sides, whereas Facebook never really let you as you were always in the eye of the public.<p>Edit: One thing I did notice that I wish they would change is that it seems as if a friend can only be placed into one circle. Often times there's a lot of overlap among my social circles and friends may be part of at least two different groups.",1309291765

Facebook beat MySpace in part because it was relatively clean; Google+ wins here by a mile.

But its use cases strike me as being more comparable to Twitter than FB.<p>3) People can be categorized into contexts and multiple contexts. This is the killer feature. I find myself wanting to just eliminate the ""Friends"" circle wholesale and just have a different circle for each cluster in my social network.<p>4) I might be misunderstanding how sharing/the feed works. But, if someone is in any circle and you are viewing that circle's stream, I think you see whatever they share. I'd like something finer-grained than that.

5588183,comment,5587450,5587615,3,0,mpclark,,,"This is oft-repeated, but not actually true. Most people in the UK who care about these things (for instance, sub editors in the printed press) hold that companies are singular entities. The confusion comes with sports teams, which are commonly referred to in the plural, so ""Microsoft is"" but ""Manchester United are"".<p>Edit: For example, here's what the Guardian's style guide says on the matter:<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/c#id-3022716"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/c#id-3022716</a><p>Of course, with something as flexible and constantly evolving (and as used and abused) as the English language, it is usually possible to find examples and counter-examples for just about anything. There are also edge cases; the Guardian refers to police forces as plural entities, I believe. Suffice to say, when I was running a back bench, singular was the order of the day when it came to company names.",1366613992

It was just so amazing, so unbelievable that you could get that much power without breaking the bank.<p>And it was the same story until about 2006, you could get an Athlon or a FX and get more than enough CPU power to run almost anything in the market at the time. Even the Sempron which was the cheap option was <i>good enough</i>, I remember guys in forums getting mobile version and OCing 'em to the very limit.<p>But then came Core2Duo, and AMD literally had nothing against it. The first Phenom sucked, big-time, there is no other way to put it. The Phenom II was much better but not good enough and the only talk about it was how you could turn on the disabled cores in the X2 and X3 variants since they were the same silicon than the quads.<p>I really wanted the FX to be as good as the Athlon-era FX, but it wasn't, not even close.",1366613902

It's awesome. I couldn't imagine much room for it in industry (although it's not entirely impossible).<p>Unfortunately, it also seems surprisingly rare even in academic CS. Certainly nobody I know at Berkeley operates this way :(. Maybe it's better in the mathematics department. For me, that would be the main draw to academia: being able to not worry about short-term usefulness and not needing to worry about marketing my work to the average programmer.<p>Besides, those ""esoteric abstractions""? They solve real problems. In surprisingly simple ways. Better than existing solutions. The only reason that ""real software developers"" don't benefit is that they aren't willing to learn them. And it is not--and should not be--the responsibility of the PL theory community to get the average programmer up to date. And, even so, some people are really trying. It brings to mind the usual saying about horses and water.<p>Also, if I may make an observation: it seems his thoughts on PL design broadly reflect the philosophy of Google in general. This is just reinforced by the designs of Golang and Dart, as well as the promotional material surrounding the languages (presentations and the like). I personally think that this almost borders on anti-intellectualism: they seem to imply that something created by ivory-tower academics with an understanding of math cannot possibly be useful in the real world; only real software engineers make practical tools.<p>And that is probably the main reason that I would choose a company like Jane Street over Google any day :P.<p>Yeah, I'm probably more annoyed by this than it's worth.

They use so-called chaos monkey [1] that shuts down random servers on a whim. This allows them to detect and get rid of dependencies, i.e. tolerate failures in other parts of the system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html</a>",1366610632

5588042,comment,5587450,5587803,2,0,asveikau,,,"Interesting link.<p>I'm not a linguist but parsing these sentences as an American reader, I feel a bit like this page's examples are playing games with word order and omission.  The cited ""prestige"" grammar sounds less intuitive to me not because of the pronoun used, but because of word order and words that are left out.<p>Example cited as correct prestige grammar:<p>> They didn't give anyone that worked less than she a raise.<p>That sounds a little weird to my American ears, but ""worked less than she did"" sounds totally correct.<p>""Worked less than her"" (cited as correct non-prestige) sounds a bit casual and informal, not sounding too jarring but not what I'd expect in decent writing.  Similar to the other example of ""us commuters"".  If I'm talking to someone I wouldn't blink if they said this, but I wouldn't see it in the New York Times.  (Though this also reminds me of phrases like ""me too"" or ""it's me"", which despite being inconsistent with distinctions between subject and object in other phrases, you'd hear a lot more than ""I as well"" or ""it is I"".)<p>> Mary and him are late.<p>Sounds very wrong to me.<p>Thinking back to my childhood it was pretty common for kids to be a bit ""confused"" about using pronouns this way before 10 years old or so, so maybe there is something to the author's statement that kids learn the non-prestige form and then the educated ones are ""corrected"" later.<p>> Mary and he are late.<p>This still sounds weird.  I'd say ""he and Mary are late"".<p>> her and us<p>> she and we<p>These sound pretty clumsy regardless of which is supposed to be used.",1366610526

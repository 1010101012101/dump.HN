I am not saying that Linux is a worse choice, but for a company that writes an OS as one of it&#x27;s core businesses, it only makes sense to run that OS in as many places as possible. For one, by running OS X as a server OS they would necessarily spend more time on development and improvement of the OS core. This would pay off in the long run by further improving stability and reliability of OS X.<p>I am not arguing that OS X is the perfect solution in most circumstances, but it can be a good solution in many situations, especially if you are Apple, and have the full source and the capability to adopt the OS as necessary.<p>Microsoft, especially nowadays, tries to be very cross compatible, so it&#x27;s not surprising that Azure supports Linux apps and guests.

All we have is anecdotal experiences. FWIW my experience is that HP&#x27;s business product lines are most reliable, and Dell&#x27;s business lines have relatively many quality issues. The HP Elite laptops have exceptional serviceability (better than any I&#x27;ve seen -- find a video and just look at how the laptop case opens for service) and tech support.<p>> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone (though probably part of a minority of shoppers).<p>Consumers buy on price, but the priorities of business IT departments are similar to yours: reliability, serviceability, and support; the costs of downtime and skilled labor for repairs far exceed the savings from buying cheap machines. Each vendor sells consumer (e.g., Dell Inspiron), and business (e.g., Dell Latitude) product lines. Maybe try shopping the products they sell to corporate IT; those match your priorites.

9503154,comment,9499457,9503028,0,0,coldtea,,,"><i>Do you think that people who are not clinically depressed (or suffering similar symptoms as part of another diagnosable illness; e.g. hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, inborn errors of metabolism, (pre)diabetes, sleep disorders, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia) compose a substantial portion of people who experience suicidality?</i><p>Yes.<p>><i>If so, can you identify any empirical evidence supporting that belief?</i><p>It&#x27;s common knowledge to mankind for millenia that most suicides are connected to real-world stressful situations and that there exist people that attempted them that were not suicidal before (and neither after they were resolved).<p>If you want the scientific version of this, it&#x27;s called &quot;situational depression&quot;, is commonly (1 in 5 sufferers or so) connected with suicidal attempts or obsession, and is described thusly:<p>An adjustment disorder (AD) (sometimes called exogenous, reactive, or situational depression) occurs when an individual is unable to adjust to or cope with a particular stressor, like a major life event. (...) Unlike major depression the disorder is caused by an outside stressor and generally resolves once the individual is able to adapt to the situation. (...)<p>That said, unlike most people in here, I&#x27;m with the anti-psychiatry school of people like R.D. Laing etc, and blame even &quot;major depression&quot; to irrational and ineffective ways of living and external conditions. I believe that&#x27;s responsible for far more cases that are casually nowadays ascribed to chemical inbalances and such (mixing correlation and causation). In the same manner, I find that most kids don&#x27;t need ADD drugs but it&#x27;s mostly a nice racket to prescribe them.<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t make me unsympathetic to major depression victims (that I believe are not chemically imbalanced). If anything it&#x27;s the opposite: not only they suffer from sensitivity to external issues and living conditions that are concrete and extremely difficult to avoid (short of changing the whole of society or their whole surroundings and life path), but they&#x27;re also drugged and numbed to make them blend in and accept them.",1430969925

They make 3-4 times the money they would if they were employed as a driver in a upper-middle class household (very common in India).<p>2.

That&#x27;s where I picked up the first of many assembly languages, after finding out it was the only way to take full advantage of the OS and achieve the best efficiencies. It&#x27;s also where I learned Pascal, which was an up-and-coming teaching language, and it soon became my go-to language for many tasks. Between Pascal and assembly I was good through about 1990, when my job required me to use a Unix server, and of course the natural language there was C. That led to C++, first on my own time then at my next job in 1997. There was a short period where I found myself applying OO concepts to assembly code! C# was a recent addition for a job-related task where it was an obviously better choice than C++.<p>Python is the interesting one of the bunch. I was exposed to it about 1995, when a coworker selected it as an embedded scripting language for our product. I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it at the time, as it was outside of my immediate responsibilities. It was selected again as an embedded scripting language at my next employer around 2003.

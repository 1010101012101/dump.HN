I think that&#x27;s a good thing, and so far samples of these have seemed to usually hit the mark.<p>On the other hand, the reason they always tell you never to explain why you gave a candidate a &quot;no&quot; is, that it will give them grounds to think you are wrong and discriminated against you. That might (might!) be the case here - the Author seems to give serious weight to the possibility of discrmination, which is of course completely possible. Had YC kept their mouth shut and <i>not</i> offered their valuable advice, maybe there would&#x27;ve been less thoughts of discrimination?

Firefox OS has exactly the same problem - Mozilla does not enforce by any way that the officially branded FxOS implementation should be open. Most of FxOS phones to date, maybe except Geeksphone, are simply closed and need some ridiculous rooting or unlocking in order to just reflash them with newer version of FxOS.<p>Just look at GTA04/Neo900 (and possibly Freerunner too, but it would probably be massively underpowered) - you could run  both Android (Replicant) and Firefox OS there without using any single line of closed source line - but that doesn&#x27;t represent the usual customer experience for Android and FxOS branded phones.

It&#x27;s of interest to computer scientists because of its relationship to linear type theory (in the same way that the Curry-Howard correspondence links type theory and classical logic) and because it has close relationships with quantum computing.<p>In particular, you are not allowed to delete or duplicate elements/propositions/types (corresponding to physical processes that cannot arbitrarily create or destroy particles, the &quot;no deletion theorem&quot; and &quot;no cloning theorem&quot; of quantum information theory), so functions of the type<p><pre><code>  duplicate :: a -> (a, a)\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>  delete :: a -> ()\n</code></pre>\nare not allowed in a linear type system. Practically, this means that many operations can be optimized by the compiler to in-place mutations, because it is guaranteed that there is only ever one reference to a particular object.",1399550022

If what you need is a browser (Firefox), an email client (K9 & the standard KitKat client) and a Terminal (ConnectBot, Hacker&#x27;s keyboard), then you won&#x27;t miss the Play store at all. There are also some good clients for social/media consummation (Tinfoil for Facebook, Twidere, TT-RSS...).<p>If you need something more, then it&#x27;s an hit or miss. For maps, OsmAnd+ is nice, but not nearly as good/user friendy as Google Maps. Forget about the latest/cool apps. Forget games, unless you want to emulate some console (and also, running closed games on top of an open emulator is &quot;ethically right&quot;?).<p>It gets better if you&#x27;re a little more lenient. For example, I have some Humble Bundle games installed. Those come drm-free, and (usually) don&#x27;t depend on the Google services. One can also get applications from the Play Store, and install just the .apk for it (I can&#x27;t remember if one can buy applications with the web interface, or has to do it from the mobile store). In the end, the choice is &quot;I want to avoid Google&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t want proprietary applications on my phone&quot;.

For many, the only way to get them is either the Play Store or compile the source. I&#x27;m not blaming the F-Droid project, they&#x27;re doing a terrific work for their size, but it seems that there&#x27;s little interest in a completely open store, even from the developers.<p>That said, I&#x27;m still running this setup, but I&#x27;m considering just giving up and installing the Play Store/Google services because after a while seeing new cool applications but not being able to try them is kinda painful.<p>On a side note, I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in battery life/speed of my device.

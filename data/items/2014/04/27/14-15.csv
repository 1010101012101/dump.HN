The PGA source was legacy code, having been ported and rewritten for every console to date. It was a serious rat&#x27;s nest, with the compiled code far too large to fit into memory, so EA had developed their own code segment loader to enable their too large to fit executables to run on the consoles. I was put in charge of the &quot;menu front end&quot;, the statistics tracking, and some of the AI logic. It was over a week just to read the logic and figure out WFT. The designs I had to implement were simply not possible with the existing framework, so I started over. I wrote a series of small finite state machines, fully documented their use in the source code, and then replaced the entirety of all the portions of the source code I was in charge of with my miniscule finite state machines and their paltry data. The segment loader was no longer needed for the front end, because I&#x27;d left 800K free (on a 1 MB system!). I spoke with a Tiger Woods PGA developer about a decade later, and my code was still there being used. And a year later, EA had me do the same thing to the AIs for NCAA Football, where I finite state machined their AIs, clobbering the memory required down to about a 6th of what it was previously.",1398610573

However, relatively little commentary also highlights downsides like the need for accumulating parameters and strictness annotations just to achieve acceptable performance, or the maintenance hazards of having both monadic and non-monadic implementations of algorithms.

7655267,comment,7650831,7654228,3,0,jganetsk,,,"There are LOTS of things you can do with type classes, and they are super sexy. Let me try to enumerate them.<p>One commenter already noted higher-kinded type classes, which is the basis of Haskell&#x27;s libraries and do-notation for monads. That&#x27;s HUGE.<p>But besides higher-kinded type classes, there are others:<p>* Factories and constants in your interfaces. Type classes allow you to put a type variable in the <i>return</i> argument of a method. This lets you put factories and constants in your type classes. For example, if you look at the monoid type class:<p><pre><code>  class Monoid a where\n    mappend: a -> a -> a\n    mzero: a\n</code></pre>\nAnd I can implement this<p><pre><code>  instance Monoid String where\n    mappend x y = AppendStrings x y\n    mzero = &quot;&quot;\n\n  instance Monoid Integer where\n    mappend x y = x + y\n    mzero = 0\n</code></pre>\nSo now I can write generic code where I can get the &quot;zero constant&quot; of a type without knowing what type that is. I could just have a genericMonoid : T where T is a type variable, and all I know about it is that it belongs to class Monoid (maybe it&#x27;s an integer, maybe it&#x27;s a string, maybe it&#x27;s something else). I can now get the zero value of whatever that type is. In fact, my method doesn&#x27;t have to be dispatched on the type of some input argument. I can dispatch on the return value. Something like<p><pre><code>  multiplyByZero : [Monoid T] int -> T  \n  multiplyByZero 0 = mzero\n  multiplyByZero n = mplus mzero (multiplyByZero (n-1))\n</code></pre>\n(Forgive my crappy Haskell pseudo syntax, I haven&#x27;t written it in a while). Not that multiply by zero is useful.<p>* Operators of greater arity than 1. So I hinted at this above. With &quot;method syntax&quot; arity is always 1. I have one &quot;this&quot;. I can operate on it. For all other arguments to my method, I cannot actually constrain them to have the same type as &quot;this&quot;. At best, with OOP, my method belongs to some base class, and I can insist that the non-this arguments are of base class type, but I cannot constrain them to have &quot;this&quot; type. This is illustrated in the monoid example above, or in the Eq example I gave, where it can be guaranteed that the two operands to == are always of the same type. In Java, the equals method has to take one argument of type &quot;Object&quot;, while the &quot;this&quot; argument has the class&#x27;s type.<p>* Multiparameter type classes. (This is behind a flag in the Haskell compiler). You can do something like this:<p><pre><code>  class Eating E F where\n    eat ::  E -> F -> Meal\n\n  # E is short for Eater\n  # F is short for Food\n</code></pre>\nso now I can type check to make sure that eaters eat the right type of food.<p><pre><code>  instance Carnivore Meat where\n    eat = # specialized implementation for eating meat\n\n  instance Carnivore Vegetables where\n    eat = # specialized implementation for eating vegetables\n\n  instance Vegeterian Vegetables where\n    eat = # specialized implementation for vegeterian food</code></pre>",1398610122

Sometimes even that might be worthwhile strategy, but I’m arguing that candidates, once they apply, should all be treated exactly the same and that the selection process should be blind to name, age, race insofar as that is possible.

I very much don&#x27;t agree there.<p>A self-signed certificate effectively gives none of the protection of a cert signed by a trusted CA so the warnigs areperfectly valid. Of course self-signed certificates are perfectly valid in specific communities: a company might sign the certificates for all its internal apps themselves and make sure their standard employee desktops & laptops trust their internal CA, or you could sign your own and have your friends and other contacts install your CA as a trusted one. But for public use they are simply not valid.<p>The commonly given comparison here is the way SSH works, but that is <i>not</i> comparing oranges to oranges. With SSH you also have some authentication credentials that have been given to you via another channel, with a self-sign certificate you do not. You can emulate SSH&#x27;s &quot;remember this servers ket fingerprint and only tell me if it has changed&quot; in most browsers by adding a permanent exception, so it&#x27;ll only moan again if the self-signed certificate changes. Firefox does this.<p><pre><code>  Having a CA signed cert proves nothing beyond that you gave some person who is trusted some amount of money who ostensibly verified something.\n</code></pre>\nThat is true, but having a self-signed cert proves <i>nothing at all</i>. There <i>is</i> some process (a process that has been shown to have exploitable flaws I&#x27;ll grant you, but a process exists and is far from completely broken) to try make sure that the CAs that are generally trusted are generally trustworthy.<p><pre><code>  Renewals which exist as a pure profit vehicle for CAs\n</code></pre>\nRenewals exist because certificates expire. Certificates expire because an infinitely valid certificate is potentially dangerous because the revokation process can not be relied upon in many cases.<p><pre><code>  ... for something so much as an expiration date ...\n  Gee, that&#x27;s a nice commerce website you have there, would be a shame if something were to happen ...\n</code></pre>\nIf your e-commerce site finds $7/year or the hassle of using StartSSL&#x27;s interface for free (or $120/y or $70/y respectively for EV certs) a problem, then it isn&#x27;t much of a profit making e-commerce site...<p><pre><code>  Charging to regenerate or revoke a certificate is just rent-seeking dick behavior                               \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll say again: keep secure copies of the relevant keys and you won&#x27;t need to use the regeneration or revocation procedures.<p><pre><code>  again, completely automated processes with zero human interaction required                                    \n</code></pre>\nAutomated processes <i>that rely on infrastructure that someone needs to create, monitor, and maintain</i>. If you ignore the infrastructure creation and maintainance costs then yes the process is zero effort and near zero cost (just a little electricity for the CPU time) but ignoring those factors is simply fallacious reasoning.<p>If you so strongly believe that this is a complete and utter rip-off and that you could do it so much cheaper, why not do so? If you <i>can</i> do it as well while charging less (or nothing) then people will flock to your service. One man&#x27;s margin is another&#x27;s opportunity.<p><pre><code>  Why do I have to pay upwards of $100 for a wildcard certificate? They don&#x27;t cost the CA anymore to issue or handle\n</code></pre>\nThat I&#x27;ll grant you, but artificial market segmentation exists <i>everywhere</i> for better or worse (usually for worse from the consumer&#x27;s PoV) rather than being a property of this particular area.<p><pre><code>  All so people who visit my website don&#x27;t get scary and misleading warnings.                                 \n</code></pre>\nThe scary warnings are not misleading in the worse cases. If a DNS hijack passes your bank&#x27;s traffic through a server that has a self-signed certificate would you want your browser to warn you or just carry on because self-signed certificates are fine usually? Unfortunately there is no way to differentiate the bad and fine situations so we give the scary warning for both to make sure we give it when it is really needed.<p>If you can think of a better way then do let people know, everyone in the know knows the current arrangement way isn&#x27;t perfect so a good idea well presented should get listened too if addequately explored and explained.<p>If what you are looking for when you refer to &quot;people visitin my website&quot; is simple anti-snooping protection (so random people on the same WAN can&#x27;t see everything for instance) rather than identity assurance, then there are already moves in that direction. HTTP2, due to be submitted for approval in final form later this year, will use encrypted traffic in <i>all</i> cases in a way the ensures this level of protection (though I&#x27;ve not yet read into the details of these proposals myself, I&#x27;ll reserve judgement on how effective that will be until I have) meaning that is soon to become a sorted problem if things work out as expected. For e-commerce or anywhere else where greater trust is required though, a CA-signed certificate will still be required because for those uses identity assurance is essential.",1398609409

The two processes (Java and Python) that were responsible for the Nagios configuration communicated over XMPP. The Java process could only be restarted once a week because we guaranteed a certain uptime to our customers.<p>One day I decided to refactor the way it worked, and this entailed a change to the api. I began with the Java code, but when I got to the Python parts, more important work came up so I left my code in a branch and forgot all about it. When the next release came up a coworker started to merge all the new features into the new release branch. He asked if he could merge my stuff, and as I had just finished some new features in another branch I said yes. Two days later the new half-refactored, untested and very scary Java code was live in production without my knowledge.<p>An hour after the release the first alerts of nagios syncing problems came in. We scratched our heads and soon discovered that we had merged too much. Now we had to choose: roll back or roll forward. To roll back we had to take down the application, restore a backup, synchronize a lot of other connected applications. After checking whether the Java code that was in production now actually worked and spit out sensible messages (it did, surprisingly) I decided to try and create the rest of the Python implementation right away.<p>So with my headphones on and a big NO sign on the door I started programming and created what would normally take one or two days in just over an hour, including the release to production. The good news was that we had had no customer downtime of the Java process and now had a much cleaner Nagios configuration system, the only bad thing was that the alerting system had been down for about 2 hours.<p>The situation was pretty fucked up ;)",1398609099

Things like first class IO actions (that you can pass around) and explicitly marked state (i.e it&#x27;s clear what you have in context and what you don&#x27;t) make for some pretty satisfying solutions you wow yourself with.<p>It is common to hear in the Haskell community remarks like &quot;Haskell is the best imperative language I&#x27;ve used.&quot;",1398608696

While I appreciate the great interop, Java&#x27;s lack of state mutation controls in the language and JVM instruction set interfere greatly with the FP/OO impedance matching, generating misconceptions about the viability of hybrid FP/OO approaches.<p>From 1994 to 1996 I went from being a 80%/20% C++/Python developer to 90%/10% Java/C++ developer. My productivity went through the roof, but the lack of something akin to C++&#x27;s `const` references and `const` methods were a glaring mistake, one that remains to this day a shadow mandating contorted defensive programming techniques. Adding `final` almost made it worse, as it&#x27;s nuanced and overloaded, and ultimately doesn&#x27;t do what less-experienced developers think it does. Because of that one serious flaw, was I ready to go back to C++? Of course not, because I was able to render my ideas into working software at a faster pace--an extremely important factor--but I had move forward being ever aware of the language weaknesses and how to effectively ameliorate them.<p>Over the last year I&#x27;ve gone from developing in Java 90% of the time to Scala 75% of the time. In this transition I have seen a similar jump in my productivity (almost, but not quite as big as C++ to Java, and after a longer learning curve). However, have approached it with the same multi-dimensional awareness of one&#x27;s paradigmatic assumptions and how they play with and against the language facilities.<p>For me, Scala was my gateway into the world of FP thinking, which radically changed the way I think about software problems. Scala has also had a profound impact in developing a deeper appreciation of the power of a more formal type system. Both of those paradigm-shifting features of the language have allowed me to be more creative, expressive and concise in my software writing, with bountiful rewards on multiple axes.<p>However, I&#x27;ve also stumbled along the way--becoming enamored of features I didn&#x27;t fully understand, being too expressive when simplicity would suffice, being FP for FP sake, etc.--but I sure am glad I had those opportunities to stumble, and do so in a &quot;fail-fast&quot; manner. The process has been invaluable, and I&#x27;m a <i>much</i> better programmer today for it. I never entered the process assuming the FP/OO/CT academic visionaries or the Smalltalk/C++/Scala/Haskell/ML/OCaml language inventors offered me any &quot;promises&quot;. They gave to the world constructs for others to think about and solve software problems, take it or leave it, to live and die in the ecosystem of ideas. I know it is <i>my</i> responsibility as a professional programmer to understand the pros and cons of those constructs and tools, weigh them against my goals, experience and intelligence, and go into a relationship with these tools knowing, <i>I&#x27;m</i> ultimately the one responsible for the final product, and need to know what I&#x27;m doing.<p>All this is to say, I don&#x27;t think sweeping generalizations nor pointed nick-picks help in assisting people select the best language and paradigm for their problem at hand, understanding the strengths <i>and</i> weaknesses, and how to manage those trade-offs. It isn&#x27;t, and doesn&#x27;t have to be a &quot;one-size-fits-all world&quot; (as someone else here already referenced the great Stroustrup\uFEFF quote: &quot;There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.&quot;\uFEFF). And at the end of the day, the ultimate responsibility rests in the hands of the individual professional developer. In my developing awareness of the FP viewpoint I have most appreciated and benefited concretely from those pragmatic viewpoints in the middle. It is from the middle that one can more clearly see <i>both</i> perspectives, and from that develop a third, more holistic and encompassing viewpoint that harnesses the power of both.",1398607993

The idea guy is not technical at all, he knows his away around in all business related matters, and coming from an ivy-league school, he has a lot of connections.<p>Four months ago he approached me with the idea, which I liked, and I started working on it. I like to do stuff, and I started working on it as a side project. I have a very well compensated job in a local startup and I would like continue to do that in the short/medium term.<p>As I said, we have a really good idea and a working product. Is not crazy to say that my co-founder could raise a couple hundred thousand dollars from investors in our current state. My concern is that so far everything, my equity, and possible future role in the company has only been agreed verbally.<p>I’ve mentioned my co-founder several times that we need to incorporate and he says it’s one of the things on his list, but never happens. He says is not the right time and that we must incorporate once the investors jump in. I feel like I’m the one who has worked the most during this four months and I don’t want to end up without a single share of ownership in the company that’s going to be behind our product.<p>HN: How can I guarantee that I keep my value as a co-founder and get something in return in case we succeed? How can I prevent this other person from taking the code (which I shared with him) and give it to someone else to continue working on it, taking me out of the picture?

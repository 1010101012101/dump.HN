All other sites.<p>With a single high end CUDA capable graphics device you can blow through 500 million MD5 operations in one second.  How many words are in an English dictionary?  Less than that.<p>That's how weak this is.  If you steal the password database from bigforum.com, you can attack all the passwords in parallel.  If you crack a password, you can then log into their facebook, gmail, paypal, whatever.  This scheme pretty much guarantees you can do that.",1246874077

689370,comment,688991,689087,0,0,gojomo,,,"I think many net neutrality proponents will eventually regret inviting greater federal involvement. Remember, the FCC is the agency that fines companies for broadcasting naughty words. Its rulemaking often aids large incumbents (who walk the halls of DC) at the expense of startups and potential entrants.<p>If the gov't wants to insist on honest disclosure of traffic-shaping policies, that'd be a pro-consumer reform. But anything which dictates what services can be offered limits the ability of firms to search the competitive space. It makes the core problem, insufficient competition and service diversity, worse rather than better.<p>Also, when political regulators have discretion over an industry's activity, it can be used as a kind of soft, subtle censorship. For example, big media companies don't savage the executive branch as much when they need FCC/FTC approval for a desired merger.<p>And what if someday, under the same paternalistic reasoning that regulates radio/TV content, an ISP is only considered 'neutral' if it carries enough 'underrepresented' viewpoints, or ensures that pro-government voices get 'equal time' against critics? Oh, and to prove compliance, keep a log of all traffic for the past 6 months, in case we need to audit.<p>We need no 'neutrality' regulations of newspapers, magazines, or books; we shouldn't need them for electronic speech.",1246871511

Several government officials committed fraud to the extent of 290 million dollars (seizing taxes the company paid to the Russian government) and despite sending different parts of the government piles of evidence, no one did a thing.<p>One thing was clear from that article that should be clear to everyone here: Russia is not a good place to do business these days.

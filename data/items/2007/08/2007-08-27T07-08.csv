46922,comment,46897,46914,0,0,jey,,,"Oh ok. :) But as a thought experiment, let's warp back in time 150 years. Some random guy you're talking to at the local pub claims that within 50 years, man will build a heavier-than-air flying machine. Would you intuitively predict that this is going to happen? Or would your intuition suggest that we'd have to wait until we can build a mechanical replica of a bird? What if someone said that within 150 years you'd have a little machine you could hold in your hand that could bring up all of the world's information, <i>and</i> let you talk to anyone on the planet in real time?<p>Human intuitions are great for hunting, gathering berries, navigating social situations, and other situations present in the <i>ancestral environment</i>, but evolution hasn't tuned us to be able to predict the future with our intuition. Just how bad are the cognitive biases employed by humans? Pretty bad: <a href=""http://www.singinst.org/Biases.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singinst.org/Biases.pdf</a><p>Anyway, not trying to pick a fight here -- I appreciate your reply above.

It gets more painful as you get older--by the time I was in my mid-twenties I had to have a good chair or I'd have serious back pain.  I also had to find ways to work with less mouse usage, or it would lead to shooting pains in my forearms.<p>I've settled into a nice place now, with a good monitor that raises up almost high enough (a Dell 2005), an Aeron chair, an IBM small form factor keyboard with good IBM keys, and a Logitech mouse that I still try to use as little as possible.  I still have occasional back and shoulder pain, but I have some injuries from bike accidents in my youth.  But I definitely take ergonomics seriously.  I can't concentrate when I'm in pain.<p>One thing that I've found makes a big difference for me: Exercise.  Almost all of my various aches and pains are less pronounced and less debilitating when I'm getting regular exercise.",1188200647

46919,comment,46878,46915,0,0,rms,,,"Firefox 2 being unstable is all the more reason to try Firefox 3!  A lot of the instability comes from the Firefox 2 rendering engine breaking down when you have Gmail and Google Docs and Meebo and 12 Youtube videos open at once. Firefox 3 is using 230 megs of RAM for me right now. If I was running Firefox 2 with the same tabs it would be moving at a crawl and using 750 megs of RAM.<p>The bug I notice the most is text entry/dropdown boxes sometimes not working correctly, this happens most often in a really poorly programmed game I play, <a href=""http://www.hyperiums.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hyperiums.com</a>.",1188199773

46915,comment,46878,46895,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I agree.  Stability in Firefox 2 is significantly worse than 1.x.  I have to restart it at least once every couple of days, and frequently have to wait 20-30 seconds for random things to complete, during which it is completely unresponsive.  If 3 beta is even slightly less stable (which would make sense) then I'll wait a while.  Hopefully those issues will be resolved.",1188199139

It should be seen as something separate for discussion, and I agree with your refutation of Searle's claims... no one said anything when I posted that paper a week ago. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43996</a><p>My belief that consciousness uploads will come before AI doesn't have much of a basis (or any basis) in fact. My intuition tells me that reverse engineering the human brain is easier than making a recursively self-improving AI.<p>My claim comes because I have the atheist's fear of my own mortality and I have to cling to my faith. I also like telling myself that my ancient, infinitely dimensional consciousness is choosing to live out a life in a computer simulation as a successful entrepreneur living through the peak of American civilization.<p>So there you go.

46913,comment,46701,46701,0,0,giardini,,,"I have a problem with the example, which I quote at length:<p>""An industrial company had called Lehman with a problem. It operated factories in Japan and California, both near fault lines. It could handle one of the two being shut down by an earthquake, but not both at the same time. Could Lehman Brothers quote a price for an option that would pay the company $10 million if both Japan and California suffered earthquakes in the same year? Lehman turned to its employee with a reputation for being able to price anything. And Seo thought it over. The earthquakes that the industrial company was worried about were not all that improbable: roughly once-a-decade events. A sloppy solution would be simply to call an insurance company and buy $10 million in coverage for the Japanese quake and then another $10 million in coverage for the California quake; the going rate was $2 million for each policy. ""If I had been lazy, I could have just quoted $4 million for the premium,"" he says. ""It would have been obnoxious to do so, but traders have been known to do it."" If either quake happened, but not both, he would have a windfall gain of $10 million. (One of his policies would pay him $10 million, but he would not be required to pay anything to the quake-fearing corporation, since it would get paid only if both earthquakes occurred.)""<p>""But there was a better solution. He needed to buy the California quake insurance for $2 million, its market price, but only if the Japanese quake happened in the same year. All Seo had to do, then, was buy enough Japanese quake insurance so that if the Japanese quake occurred, he could afford to pay the insurance company for his $10 million California insurance policy: $2 million. In other words, he didn't need $10 million of Japanese quake insurance; he needed only $2 million. The cost of that was a mere $400,000. For that sum, he could insure the manufacturing company against its strange risk at little risk to himself. Anything he charged above $400,000 was pure profit for Lehman Brothers.""<p>My question:<p>Shouldn't the text instead read ""Anything he charged above $2,400,000...""? Suppose the CA earthquake occurs _before_ the JP earthquake. After the JP earthquake the insurer receives $2M but it's too late to buy CA insurance on a past event.<p>To use one policy to pay for another, the insurer must buy both policies at the same time. Otherwise the risk of an uncovered event would occur.<p>It would be cheaper to merely buy  $10M worth of either CA or JP insurance alone (but not both), since, certeris paribus, either would cost only $2M. <p>Am I missing something?",1188198795

Jython does exactly that - it compiles python into java (I think it emits bytecode and not Java source, but don&#x27;t call me on that) with a lot of runtime so it can support proper semantics. It has been around for over a decade now too and it supports full python (with usual caveats)",1443376747

So, in the cases where cultural &quot;borrowing&quot; is driven by the intent to abuse, rather than the actual desire to assimilate the practice into one&#x27;s own culture, would you agree that that is bad, also? Because that is the only point I&#x27;m making - that that is what the original definition of appropriation was about - where willful abuse was the point of it. Where it&#x27;s a method of abuse.<p>Beyond that, it&#x27;s a spectrum and a matter of degree.  Mason jars is not appropriation. A silly pop star wearing cornrows is probably not appropriation, although some valid counterpoints might exist. Someone wearing a native american headdress to sell cars, or the Washington Redskins refusing to rename, or the KC Chiefs singing the tomahawk song at their stadium... those debates get a bit meatier.",1443376561
10287280,comment,10286190,10286922,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Interesting comment but I am having trouble wrapping my head around the idea.<p>A turbocharger doesn&#x27;t create energy.  It&#x27;s function is to increase the volumetric efficiency of the IC engine.  How?  By allowing more fuel to be pumped into the same size engine.  It really is that simple.<p>Ideal combustion of gasoline occurs at the stoichiometric ratio, which is 14.7 to 1 (roughly, lots of variables).  Let&#x27;s call it 15 to 1.<p>That means you need 15 grams of air [1] for every gram of gasoline you pump into the engine.<p>How do you generate more power?<p>You burn more fuel per unit time.<p>How do you burn more fuel per unit time?<p>You build a bigger engine or you figure out how to pump more fuel into the same engine.<p>What is the limiting factor in being able to pump more fuel into the same engine?<p>You can&#x27;t get enough air into a naturally aspirated engine in order to maintain the roughly 15 to 1 ratio.  If you can&#x27;t get more air into the engine you can&#x27;t pump more fuel into it.  Period.<p>How do we get more air into the engine?<p>You build a compressor.  The compressor can be powered directly from the engine&#x27;s drive shaft, in which case it is called a &quot;supercharger&quot;, or it can be powered by exhaust gasses, which is known as a &quot;turbocharger&quot;.<p>A turbocharger doesn&#x27;t turn a piston engine into a turbine.  It&#x27;s function is to forcefully shove more air into the combustion chamber in order to allow a proportionally greater amount of fuel to be burned per unit time, thereby producing more power per engine unit volume, often termed &quot;volumetric efficiency&quot;.<p>A greater volumetric efficiency does NOT mean an engine is more efficient.  This is often a mistake made by consumers when buying cars.  A turbocharger allows you to make more power with the same engine.  It does not make it more efficient other than recovering some of the energy lost through exhaust.<p>Having owned several turbocharged and twin turbocharged fire-breathing monsters over the years I can tell you fuel efficiency was never better than non-turbo cars and, in my case at least, never a criteria for buying them.  The latter said with a big fucking grin.  And I have the speeding ticket collection to prove it.<p><pre><code>    officer: Do you know how fast you were going? I could not\n             catch up to you until I turned on the lights and\n             you slowed down.\n    driver (not to be identified):\n             Not sure.  I stopped looking at the speedometer\n             at 120.\n    officer: If you want to get out of this ticket you have\n             to let me take this thing for a spin.\n    driver (now absolutely perplexed):\n             Here are the keys, sir\n    \n    That was the longest uncomfortable 45 minute wait standing \n    by a CHP patrol car in the middle of the California desert.\n    The grin in the officer&#x27;s face told the driver (not to be \n    identified) all would be well.

However, if that is what you are doing, I am afraid that Julia could become the GNU Hurd or programming languages.  Most languages, at least those that have practical relevance, have design flaws.  Heck, R is one giant mess of design flaws, and yet it is actually amazingly useful.  Another example would be Perl.  I think design flaws can be a sign that the creators of these languages are reasonable people who are capable of making pragmatic decisions (instead of just academic decisions).  I’m clearly not an expert and I’m not up-to-date with what is going on in Julia but as a potential user I have the impression that we’re not moving closer to a point where Julia is ready for production use, and I’m worried that Julia will lose momentum while R is growing stronger and deeper roots.  Personally, I really like Julia and would prefer if it would replace R but over time this is becoming less and less likely.

In every case the 0-based indexing had fewer (+1)&#x27;s and (-1)&#x27;s than the 1-based code. For instance k%n returns a number in the range [0,n), or in Julia notation [0:n-1].

94361,story,,,2,2,halbertn,"Ask YC: Capistrano help w/ sudo",,"Hello All,\nI'm at my wits end here...\nI'm using capistrano 2.1.\nI'm overwriting the finalize_update task in my deploy script to run sudo so that I can perform some misc linux calls. Here's a sample call:<p><pre><code>  task :finalize_update, :except => { :no_release => true } do\n    # chown the new directory to apache:apache\n    run ""sudo -p 'sudo password:' chown -R apache:apache #{latest_release}""\n  end\n</code></pre>\nI do see the 'sudo password:' prompt, however anything I type appears on the terminal and hitting enter doesn't send my password over.  Prior to the sudo call, when I'm prompted for a password, I don't see my character inputs on the screen, typical of entering passwords in linux terminal,...so it appears that the sudo password prompt is broken.  Is there a setting that I have not configured properly?<p>I've been searching google, and part of the new features for capistraion 2.1 is that it recognizes the '-p' option on sudo. As quoted:<p>Use sudo -p switch to set sudo password prompt to something predictable.<p>I don't understand this statement. What password prompt is ""something predictable""?<p>Thanks for any help!",1199306313

94358,comment,94250,94250,0,0,DaniFong,,,"The analysis here seems pretty shallow. As in every other deal, one needs to consider what they're offering, and your own position.<p>In our case, we are equity rich and cash poor. We don't care nearly so much about our share, so long as a great product gets off the ground. We also don't particularly think it's a wise course of action to bargain with a law firm. Especially when one has better things to do.<p>We're talking about 1% here. Shouldn't you be spending time worrying about your product? Or more cynically, getting a better VC deal?<p>Lastly, there's the equity equation. If these particular lawyers would improve your prospects for 1.01% over the alternative (other lawyers, or more specifically, over the bargaining process for other lawyers when you should probably just be coding), it should be worth it: more if you're risk averse.",1199305447

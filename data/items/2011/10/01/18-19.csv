3060799,comment,3060221,3060221,2,0,leftnode,,,"Dallas, TX - SpeedFC (<a href=""http://www.speedfc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speedfc.com</a>)<p>The company I work for, SpeedFC, is looking for some excellent PHP developers to build our ever growing team. We're currently a team of 11 developers with 4 team leads and 7 developers (I'm a team lead but do plenty of development too).<p>We do end to end e-commerce. We handle the websites of our clients (you may touch on this, but not often), the backend warehouse software (what you'll be working on), customer service, and fulfillment. We own 100% of our code, it's all written in house so you'll definitely have a chance to work on new products with fresh code. Now, you will also have to work on old projects with old code. Comes with the territory.<p>Our stack is full Linux, Apache, Postgres, and PHP. Even if you're not familiar with Postgres, but have a good PHP and SQL database background, still apply.<p>Why you would want to work here<p>We work with a tremendous amount of data and ensuring it's correct at all times is a difficult job. So, if you're in for a challenge, working here is great. Now, there are some downsides. We have an old codebase, largely untested and undocumented. You'll have to work on some stuff that will want to make you tear your hair out.<p>That is now changing! All code developed on my team is unit tested, documented through tests, and fresh PHP5.3+. We do code reviews, demo days, and have an official QA department. Also, right now my team is about to start working on a difficult and far reaching data synchronization problem. Thus, if you want to be a member on a project building code from scratch and ""doing it the right way"", now would be a great time to join my team.<p>Another nice aspect of the job: if you think something needs to be done, write up a short document explaining why and the benefits it will have, submit it to the bosses and get it approved. The executives are more than willing to let you work on fresh projects that will help the company.<p>Mix the good with the bad, and overall it's a good place to work. They just built us our own custom private office for developers only so other employees can't come bug you easily.<p>We won't help you relocate, unfortunately.<p>Availability - Now<p>Benefits<p>Health, Dental, and Vision. You don't start off with an incredible amount of PTO, and Christmas time is pretty nuts around here, but they say they're working on it, so we'll see what happens.<p>I will be your team lead. I won't be your boss. I won't know your salary, for example. I like working closely with my team members and bouncing ideas off them. I'm more than open to using different technologies where they fit and moving away from PHP where necessary.<p>Email me vcherubini@speedfc.com with your resume attached. I'll be doing the interviews, and I keep them very much functional and not theoretical. You won't have to bust out your college text books to remember what a red/black tree is, I want to know your past and current projects, and have a good discussion about you as a software developer, not an algorithm memorizer.",1317495519

Pay $3 to mail a letter. Save trees. Eliminate junk mail.<p>> However, the problem is that our government lacks incentives to stop growing, and we need to introduce them.<p>I agree.<p>I'd start with not allowing the government to print its own money.

3060787,story,,,1,0,suntecautoglass,"How Auto Glass Is Made",http://www.suntecautoglass.com/parker-palo-verde-morristown,"The Tempering Process:<p>The tempering process begins by cutting raw glass to an exact size and shape then smoothing the sharp edges. Side and rear windows must undergo a silk screening process. For example, the electric circuit for heated rear windows is screened on with a silver ceramic paste which bonds to the glass as it bakes. The bending process follows in which   glass is transported through a furnace with temperatures as high as 1500 degrees Fahrenheit. Curved rolls, presses or bending rings are used to shape the hot glass and then pressurized air cools it quickly. The window looks like ordinary glass but it is much stronger but if tempered glass does break it disintegrates into small fragments with rounded edges. The tempering process makes auto glass stronger and safer!",1317495238

If the people you are talking to aren't sharing your enthusiasm (and willingness to work), there's not a good fit.  Either change the idea, or change the people you approach.<p>In the second case, at work: here it depends on what your role is.  If you are not a manager, it's not your job to get people to do stuff-- just do what you are assigned, and if it seems appropriate, take initiative and do more.  Don't worry about what the others are doing.  If, on the other hand, you <i>are</i> a manager: well, then you have bigger problems than a simple post to HN is likely to fix.",1317495214

3060708,comment,3060105,3060666,6,0,EGreg,,,"I've heard that a lot. The problem with this kind of formulation is that ""rights"" is a loaded term, like ""intellectual property"". It implies that there are some universally recognized rights that come from nature, and only those. For example, if ""intellectual property"" was a natural right, then where does the 20 years come from in patents? That number 20, or the length of copyright, show that it's society's conventions and not rights.<p>Instead, I treat everything as ""expectations"". Thousands of years ago, most people expected to hunt or farm if they wanted to eat. 500 years ago you didn't expect almost every child to survive past childbirth and the early years. Now we expect all these things and more. Clean water. Food that doesn't contain killer bacteria. Buildings that don't have obvious structural problems.<p>Obviously we can't ensure things 100% but we as a society can work to set up organizations to regulate and oversee these things. A free market allows anyone to start cutting corners at any time, such as a new and inexperienced company that wants to make things cheaper. For example, a real estate developer can build a building that's not up to code. In theory, we could all walk around with our own subscriptions to private ""auditing agencies"" like Zagat for buildings, that would inspect buildings as they are built or whatever. But most of us outsource this kind of stuff to a centralized government. Which we vote for. Also, government could tax us to do unprofitable stuff such as the US Postal Service.<p>However, the problem is that our government lacks incentives to stop growing, and we need to introduce them.",1317493799

I figured it would be worth posting a concept I've been thinking about to hopefully get some good feedback. Not sure if its the right forum for something like that, but here goes.<p>To begin, I do search engine marketing for Roomorama.com, I'm part of the founding team, and love working there, though am always thinking about new potential projects, like I'm sure most of us do.<p>The theory I'm working under for the concept I'd like to get feedback on, is that ""search"", as it currently exists for the most part, is an indexing and  parsing of HTML, while the web, and what people actually want when using search, isn't HTML. Its objects that match their long tail criteria.<p>When you think about it, the results that come from the current process, are only a good approximation of what searchers really want. If I'm looking for a blog post about the American Jobs Act from a liberal blogger under 500 words, will Google be able to really help? Or if I'm looking for an event, the weekend of October 15, in Denver, that's good for kids, will Google help by returning HTML pages? Not really. If you're a savvy web user, you go to the vertical search engine that is best (indeed for jobs for example, or eventful for events, or whatever). But that requires the person knowing those engines, which most people in the real world dont.<p>Google is trying to get structured data into search results (ITA software acquisition as example), but it has been kind of a mess. Try searching ""apple pie recipe"" and look at the mess that they offer up. I have no doubt theyre going to improve, but the major search engines architecture and infrastructure is so fundamentally based on the concept of HTML web pages being the backbone of the internet, that I think its going to be hard for them to really move away from that.<p>Is there room for a search engine that starts from the beginning, looks at each vertical, brings structured data into the system (via partnerships with the vertical search engines that exist) and intelligently returns the results that their searchers really want, with a smart way of being able to sort and refine?<p>Just throwing it out there.

I drove a long distance (maybe 60 miles?) for the first time in years yesterday because I'm staying with my mom in the suburbs that have 0 public transportation infrastructure.<p>First: It's impossible to have a life without a car here when the weather gets bad for biking (I'm outside of Seattle so that's a pretty good % of the year). People without a car are basically prisoners in this town with no culture, where the last bus from town leaves at 6:45. I can't go to work on days I can't bike because I usually work crazy long hours, til 10 or 11pm so I have to work from home if the weather's going to be prohibitive (I didn't bring my waterproof gear with me).<p>Second: My mind was blown at the mental space driving in a car for a long period of time put me in. Weird stuff like traffic lights gave me this feeling of helplessness. It's a blueprint for a system of arbitrary, total control. The fact that no decisions are really based on the situation at hand but on these lights that mindlessly blink from green to red to green to red and you never interact with anyone or anything except through this sheets of glass. Call me crazy but I really think one of the big influences that's creating the massive societal problems we have in the USA can be traced to the fact that between work, home, school, and whatever destinations we get to we interact with one another in this alienated and antagonistic way.<p>[edit] I know this rant is a little off topic, but it just highlights to me the need for a coherent public transportation network. It'd be interesting to look at this draconian regulation in relation to what was done to the rail network in the USA in the middle of the 20th century.

Let&#x27;s accept that Facebook, Google, Yahoo et al are rapacious profit-oriented corporations who could give a crap about anything but their own self interest. Fine.<p>2. At this point, given the statements made, in order for there to still be some kind of &quot;back door&quot; direct access to all of their DBs by the NSA, it would involve direct, bald-faced, massive lies to the public about its existence by top management.<p>3. What would the <i>cost</i> be to these companies be if these were revealed to be massive lies? I&#x27;m not talking about the government granting immunity from prosecution, which most commentary seems to focus on. I&#x27;m asking, how would customers react?<p>Answer: <i>Their business would blow up.</i> Revelations of lying at this scale, completely destroying their credibility, would literally threaten the entire existence of their companies. It would be a stupendous business risk to take on.<p>4. What is the <i>probability</i> that such a massive lie would be revealed? Consider that to facilitate broad access to company datasets there would need to be a bunch of technical staff in on the conspiracy -- and not just at one company. This allegedly involves <i>most</i> of the major Internet companies. A whistleblower at any <i>one</i> of them would blow it for everyone.<p>So, in order for any one company to participate in the conspiracy, they would need to take a bet-your-company risk that <i>all the other companies</i> would keep a lid on it.<p>5. Finally, now that we&#x27;ve reviewed the downsides, what&#x27;s the upside? What would the <i>benefit</i> to these companies be of lying? Some commentary has suggested they obtained privileged information about competitors or foreign attackers (e.g. Google & China). Ok. How does that benefit compare to the risk of <i>nuking billions of dollars in value overnight</i> if your company&#x27;s credibility with customers is utterly destroyed?<p>I am all for more public oversight of the secret courts governing these requests for data. The Verizon order is extraordinarily broad, and we can&#x27;t have much confidence that even the relatively small number of monitored Facebook accounts aren&#x27;t abuses.

5884268,comment,5883673,5883673,10,0,mark242,,,"Dev here. Thanks to everyone for the comments, suggestions, and support. MailDrop is one of those nights-and-weekends projects that came together as a bit of an experiment.<p>Here&#x27;s a few responses. The design at a wider width is, okay, let&#x27;s call it suboptimal. Send me a pull request with a fix for 1600px screens and I&#x27;ll gladly put it in. Testing was originally done on a non-maximized desktop, along with an iPad and iPhone. (If something looks strange on Android, send me a pull request for that fix, too.)<p>MailDrop was designed to be a friendly clone of Mailinator, with a little different architecture. It isn&#x27;t going to approach the speed of Mailinator, but I&#x27;d like to think the extra functionality makes up for it. You can point any CNAME or MX toward MailDrop and it will accept messages; the system doesn&#x27;t care about the recipient domain at all.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to browse through the (poorly-formatted; what&#x27;s up with that?) source, here&#x27;s a quick roundup of the architecture. MailDrop runs in two JVMs and uses Redis as its datastore. One JVM runs the SMTP server (written in Scala, using the SubEthaSMTP Java library and a collection of custom Akka actors) and one JVM runs the webserver (written in Scala/Play).<p>Performance should always be IO bound; the Akka actors use very little CPU overhead. If you&#x27;re finding that you&#x27;re running into bottlenecks, spinning up another JVM is pretty easy. Right now, maildrop.cc is running on one small EC2 instance for everything; if it explodes, I&#x27;d probably just add another instance for another SMTP server.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that there&#x27;s no way to actually send mail from MailDrop. That&#x27;s by design-- the moment you can send e-mail from a service without authentication, spammers are all over it. Hence, no forwarding messages, no forwarding inboxes, etc. MailDrop is designed to help fight spam.<p>Thanks again for the responses!",1371276154

The company specifically &quot;argued that the order violated its users&#x27; Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.&quot;<p>If, as NSA (and Silicon Valley) defenders claim, PRISM is nothing more than a harmless little drop-box mechanism for delivering to the government what these companies were already providing, why would Yahoo possibly be in court so vigorously resisting it and arguing that it violates their users&#x27; Fourth Amendment rights? Similarly, how could it possibly be said - as US government officials have - that PRISM has been instrumental in stopping terrorist plots if it did not enhance the NSA&#x27;s collection capabilities?&quot;</i>",1371276108

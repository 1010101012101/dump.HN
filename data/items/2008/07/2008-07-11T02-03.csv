243179,story,,,5,5,bobhoward,"Ask YC: Where have all the cowbo... web designers gone?",,"In my spare time, I fancy myself an entrepreneur and maybe even a decent web designer. More specifically, <i>I am a computer scientist</i> who loves to hack away for however long it takes to bring a particular idea to life. (i.e., I am NOT an MBA looking for a handout and I do fully appreciate the difficulty of both frontend and backend development)<p>That being said, it is quite plain that accessible, standards-compliant, and beautiful(!) web design is just as essential to the success of a startup as is the code powering the thing in the first place. And frankly, my sorta-kinda-not-really-good-enough web design skillz simply won't cut it when it comes time to do the public launch.<p>Now, problem is, though I have something like one or two dozen friends that I could very easily ask for help on the technical end of things (with the promise of equity, partnership, a few beers, or whatever) I know exactly ZERO folks who could join up and help to build a sleek, functional, and standards-compliant frontend.<p>While I do realize that I could solve this problem by spending the Big Bucks and hiring someone with the aforementioned credentials, the problem remains that I'm not exactly loaded at the moment and I'm really just looking to launch something on my own with the help of some friends. After all, big design contracts can come later once a few investors have been brought on board.<p>Thus, we arrive at the big question: have any of you folks out there experienced a similar dearth of designers? And, if not, do you have any suggestions as to where one might find local web design talent whom share in the entrepreneurial spirit and are more interested in becoming part of a potentially growing startup than in being contracted for large sums of money?",1215744650

243159,comment,243046,243046,0,0,ars,,,"I'm sorry but I don't believe them that it can run for 300km in between refuels. Compressed air is just not a very dense fuel. Enough fuel to power a car for that long would be a tank about 1/3 the size of the car.<p>(My calculation: gasoline stores about 3000 times as much energy as compressed air per volume. But a gasoline engine is also only 10% efficient, an air engine would be much more efficient. Assuming 100% efficient, then gasoline stores 300 times as much. I can go about 300km using 11 or so gallons of gas. Lets assume a lighter car, so 5 gallons per 300km * 300 = 1500 gallons of air, which is about 5.5 cubic meters. So you'd need a box 1.75 meters on each side. Which is about 1/3 of a car.)<p>Obviously if they can store the air at a higher density then the box can be smaller, but if they did that it would also have to be stronger and thus heavier. (Edit: they are running at about 1/3 more pressure than my numbers assumed.)<p>And now comes the bigger problem: you waste a tremendous amount of energy by heating the air when you compress it.<p>And then you let the air cool, and lose again, because as it expands it gets _really_ cold, and won't expand as much. On the plus side running the A/C will be free. But forget about heat in the winter.<p>Using higher compression makes this much worse.<p>All in all, I simply don't think this will work for that distance. Maybe as a 30km car it would work fine (and there's a large market for that), but not 300km.<p>And the heating/cooling losses are really going to hurt efficiency.<p>And as an aside using vegetable oil is a bad idea. Unless you can seal it away from air (doubtful) it will oxidize and won't be oil anymore.<p>Now please tell me if I made any mistakes in my calculations.",1215742667

243156,comment,243099,243099,0,0,gm,,,"One thing that is a little confusing about the site are the images at the bottom:  They are too zoomed in...  Are these images meant to be abstract?  It's almost like a puzzle to figure out what they are:<p>- The leftmost image:  Just plug in your camera...  Wait, didn't you skip the step where I install something on my computer?  ""Just plug in your camera and click share""... How will my computer know to send the images to your site? The image is a closeup of what will appear on a Windows XP computer.  What about the Apple/Mac guy, or the Vista guy?  What will they see?<p>It also has a link to the uploader app install description... But nothing near the link implies that.  It appears the link tells you how to plug in your camera.  Pretty misleading.<p>The uploader description then has only screenshots for Windows XP.  If I have any other operating system, I am switching away from your site right about now...<p>- Ok, the second picture on the bottom.  What is it a closeup of?  Why do you closeup on nearly identical images?  Is your site going to make four copies of every one of my pictures?  Why? The topic of that is that you can forward the grid to whomever you like, but as I read that I am thinking about the significance of you having put up four, at first sight, identical Eiffel Towers.  Zoom out the image, use different pictures (babies, animals, cars, etc...) and let it be obvious we are looking at the actual grid we are sending out.<p>- Third picture (sorry they are all misleading :-) !).  WTF is that doing there?  Do I actually now drag my pictures to that area that quite clearly says ""drag photos here""?  It appears not to be a screenshot at first. I have NO freeking idea what the screenshot if of, all I know is that I want to drag my photos to the stupid image that tells me to do so.  I am guessing it is an area of your uploader...  I don't know because I have not installed it yet (And you have not told me I have to install anything).  This image is simply confusing.  You only mention drag and drop near the bottom.<p>- Fourth area... OK, I know XP so I know that is a status icon saying I am uploading photos.  But the text talks about how you upload full size photos.  Not the best image  you could have for this.<p>Hehe, I don't mean to come down hard on you, but the design of the main page could be better, aside from the thing I mentioned before, I truly have no freekin idea if you guys work with O/Ses other than XP.<p>You need to mention what OSes you support, you need to provide instructions with screenshots for each OS, And you need screenshots of at least the full window people are looking at, it is not the right time to present the user with a jigsaw puzzle of partial screen area images.<p>Too many shots of the Eiffel Tower.  People don't shoot 24 photos of the same thing (and then run off to share them), at least not people to whom you are aiming your site.<p>Lastly :-)...  you need a cleaner web design overall...  Compare your site to smugmug.com, for example.<p>This is all meant to be constructive feedback, by the way.  I would not waste the time it took to write this on trashing someone else.  You guys are doing well, you just need minor adjustments.<p>EDIT: As a wannabe photographer I will ask you this:  Why are your images all square?  Do you resize them to be so?  Practically no camera I know takes square photos...  Will you crop my photos if I upload them to your site?  Either don't use perfectly square photos in your samples, or tell me if you will modify my photos when I upload them.",1215742488

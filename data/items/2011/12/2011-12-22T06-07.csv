I don't know whether you want to run it in house.  You could then vet the affiliates, but on the other hand, a bunch of douchbags running around hitting up doctors offices may not be all bad.<p>I am a few years ahead of you in terms of a bootstrapped business.  A few orders of magnitude more revenue, and I highly recommend keeping the affiliate program in house.  If the affiliate looks good, then you can cookie tag the affiliate based on referrer, and get all the link juice.  If they are shady, then refer them to your bullshit affiliate program at clickbuy/CJ/etc.  This is the best strategy, IMO.",1324537151

I like the few changes strict mode did except for one thing that breaks compatibility in an unfortunate way (this is bound to the primitive, not the boxed number). But we should take all this much further.<p>More important than anything I'd like us to start talking about sane subsets of JS more, and stop limiting ourselves to what one author considers ""good"" because quite frankly, _that_ subsets still contains a whole lot of awful stuff.",1324536954

It doesn't seem likely that you'll be very open to learning data structure design and asymptotic complexity when you're still wrestling with for loop syntax, the difference between assignment and reference, what the hell recursion is, etc. You have to learn to walk before you can learn to run, and while jumping in the deep end may work for some, I'd guess most would find a more programmer-friendly introductory language a quicker path to comprehending basic CS concepts and would subsequently be in a much stronger position to tackle C.",1324536712

And if there's such an obvious better answer, why doesn't someone do it?""<p>Here's a simple answer:  The better system exists, but people overlook it.<p>As a student, first get a Bachelor's degree.<p>Second, pick a field and be sure have learned it well at at least the Bachelor's level.  Do this learning independently if necessary.  A Bachelor's degree is supposed to teach you how to do at least this much learning independently.<p>Third, from that learning about the field you selected, learn some more, to 'the next level'.  Likely do this independently.<p>Fourth, show up at any one of the better research universities and take the Ph.D. qualifying exams based on what you learned.<p>Fifth, stick around that university and attend some seminars and courses that are introductions to research given by experts in research.  Here your work is largely independent.<p>Sixth, pick a research problem and get some good results, independently or nearly so.  If there is any doubt about the significance of your research, then publish it.<p>Seventh, submit your research as your Ph.D. dissertation.<p>Congratulations:  You are now out of school; you went all the way; you are educated.  Done.",1324536174

In plain Javascript, you can use ""var x"" to scope x to the current scope (and in 1.7, you can use 'let' to scope to the current block, not just to a function), but there's no corollary in Coffeescript, since Coffeescript manages scoping for you automagically. It's a convenience 99% of the time, but the 1% of the time that it's not, it's a giant pain in the ass. If there were something like var/let/local, you could solve the problem manually, but as the Twitter exchange indicated, there is no plan to add it.<p>The solution/workaround is ""use descriptive names and avoid polluting scopes"", but the reality of software development is that you're eventually going to cross those wires, and it's going to make you crazy until you figure out what happened.",1324534722

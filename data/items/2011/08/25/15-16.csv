2925306,comment,2924399,2924399,2,0,TheCapn,,,"I'm going to speak from the role of recent graduate in Software Engineering, a strong focus on math here...<p>1) Visualization of mathematical concepts is a skill that many students simply lack. When someone asks me to crunch out 1.5 * 3.67 mentally I don't see much of an issue because its a simple concept for me to break it down and go 3/2 * 11/3 and work from there. Many people don't make the connection and the root of that issue exists beyond the whole calculator discussion in my honest opinion.<p>2) The first reply on that page is a very important one, students with a strong mathematical foundation are found in the natural sciences. It is rare to find students practicing strong math skills outside of these faculties. Its the same argument we saw with Engineers lacking english language skills, the students who excel in that field are drawn that way so its only natural to have some deficiencies.<p>3) Profs from a different generation gap are part of the problem in the idea that they're slow to adopt a technology-centric system. My honest opinion is that formula sheets should be allowed in all exams with the criteria that: i) they're hand-written ii) they're of limited length (1 standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper, single sided) and iii) no photo-copies This forces students to look at the information they've been given and make rational decisions for what formula are important, which ones can be memorized, and enforces studying. My electrostatics course forced memorization on us and I spent more time shoving formulas into my noggin instead of applying concepts to solve actual problems. As soon as the final was complete those formuli leaked from my brain onto the floor and are now forgotten. I honestly wish I was allowed more time to solve problems then to attempt memorization.<p>Basically what I mean to say when I state that ""profs are slow to adapt"" is that we live in a technology centered world now. Information such as formula or constants are accessable almost instantly from google and the likes so instead of using valuable time to have students memorize these things time would be spent better if they allowed ""cheat-sheets"" and instead required a higher amount of work or knowledge per semester. I'd gladly trade the time spent memorizing different formula for magnetic flux in favor of another two or three chapters from the book giving more than the ""ideal scenario"" cases we were given.",1314287938

2925278,comment,2924399,2924399,1,0,CesareBorgia,,,"Economics demands a strong background in math and any undergrad program worth its salt will require at least multivariate calculus (if not analysis), linear algebra and a fairly robust course in statistics. Beyond this, a proper understanding of metric spaces, fixed point theorems and rigorous stats are all useful and almost essential tools. All of these courses should be proof based. I've said it before and I'll say it again: If it's not proof based, it's not mathematics. It's computation (and I don't mean computer science).<p>Unfortunately, even programs at many ""top"" universities sometimes skip these requirements. There are very few undergrad economics degrees worth the paper that they are written on.<p>As to the theory that arithmetic is any determinant of success in real math, I have only anecdotal evidence that this is false. Having gone to an undergrad university with a top 5 math department, I can assure you that people who are some of the most significant contributors to their fields sometimes struggle at the chalk board when it comes to ""basic math."" I think it is not clear to most people that arithmetic is not math. It is not the ""base"" of math, and skill in this area does not provide a ""strong foundation"" for math. Math is the study of quantity, structure, space and change (to borrow a leaf from wikipedia) among other things. It is the most fundamental of the sciences in a metaphysical sense (it may be argued that philosophy is the real root, but I would say that at their most fundamental, there is significant convergence between math and philosophy). Arithmetic is not related in any form to this.",1314287497

They will be buying for the patents and will have no interest in doing anything with WebOS.<p>HP could try to sell WebOS separate from the patent portfolio, but no sane entity would buy unless the sale included some kind of permanent license to any of the Palm patents that WebOS implements. Such a license would would lower the market value of the patent portfolio, so I don't see much chance of HP doing that.<p>If Google, Apple, or Microsoft fail to buy the Palm IP, then maybe there is a chance. Perhaps one of the non-Motorola Android phone makers might be interested in diversifying--they can't be too happy with Google buying Motorola's phone business.

2925189,comment,2924399,2924399,1,0,TeMPOraL,,,"I think that learning to do mental computations vs. relying on technology is a trade-off. As hermannj314 pointed out [1], there's an issue whether memorizing multiplication tables/trigonometric tables is a matter of fundamentals, or it's just how we used to live before calculators to be able to compute anything. Well, I think it's both in some sense.<p>Human brain is good at some things (pattern matching, quick look-up, aka. intuition), and terribly bad at others (computation, explicitly running algorithms). I do believe that we should augment our mental skill whenever possible - we're already thinking using our environment [2], so unless one rejects pen and paper, or even looking at things around him/her, one is using his environment to increase his mental powers. So why stop at handwriting? Why not use slide rules, calculators and Google?<p>There's the other side of the trade-off though. Learning tables with numbers, or multiplication tricks, or doing lots of exercises with plotting functions by hand is the way we leverage the power of our brains. Our minds seem to be good at caching stuff and quickly looking things up, so the more such mental tools we incorporate, the more power we can get of our thought process.<p>In a very simplifying way:<p>Our cognitive powers = internal 'skills' in thinking * external tools we have.<p>The best strategy is to properly invest on both sides of the multiplication. Boosting only one side is suboptimal.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2924937"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2924937</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://consc.net/papers/extended.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consc.net/papers/extended.html</a>",1314286044

2925161,comment,2924399,2924399,3,0,alphaBetaGamma,,,"I may be old school, but I believe that technology can only very mildly help with mathematical understanding. Math is build of bricks, one on top of the others. And to understand advanced concepts, you need a deep and solid understanding of the lower layers. I think you only get this understanding by thinking hard, looking at examples and building your own.<p>Calculators are fine if you are dealing with numbers, but if you work in a quantitative field you often dont deal with numbers directly: you deal with expressions involving variables. You manipulate the expressions, and at the very end you plug in numbers. A calculator is of no help, and I hope you did not use one when you learned how to deal with numbers. You better be able to manipulate fractions, and know the distributive & associative laws, and know when to complete the square, and the exp(ln(x)) trick, etc What, you say I could use Mathematica? Of course, and I do -- when I know exactly what to compute. But generally I do not: I have these relations and I try to make sense of them. Moreover, when the final result is nice, concise and elegant, it means that I do not fully understand the problem. Examining the computation will help me understand what is happening: what part of the equations cancel with what other part, and do I understand why? Good luck doing that with Mathematica.<p>Another example: continuity. Nothing is simpler: you plot a few graphs, and the functions are discontinuous where there are jumps. Who need this epsilon/delta gibberish?<p>- Functions that are discontinuous everywhere? Ok, I can wrap my head around that. Still no need for epsilon deltas.<p>- A function that is discontinuous on the rationales and continuous on the irrationals [1]? Good luck understanding that with your graphic calculator.<p>- And the topological definition of continuity [2]? This is a beautiful definitions, that unifies all the definitions of continuity you have seen for all these functions of THIS space into THAT space. Well, thinking and well chosen examples are going to help you understand the definition, not technology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function#Continuous_functions_between_topological_spaces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function#Continuous_...</a>",1314285578

2925118,comment,2924399,2924831,2,0,jerf,,,"What it really all boils down to from my point of view is that the question is ""Can we really teach mathematics (<i>qua</i> mathematics, as opposed to raw computation) without at some point creating a firm intellectual foundation?""... and there are some people arguing <i>yes</i>, which just boggles the mind.<p>Yes, you may never in life have to subtract 1/4 from 3/4, but even so, in the grand scheme of mathematics manipulating fractions is the <i>easy</i> part, and still useful if only as a really good place to practice and pick up useful manipulations on relatively concrete items, before you move on to more abstract versions of the same operations, which <i>are</i> used everywhere in mathematics.<p>(I'd also point out I phrased it as ""at some point"", not ""at the beginning""; in general we can't solve the chicken-and-egg problem and just start Kindergartners on pure set and number theory. But at <i>some</i> point you need a decent foundation laid down or you will never build a strong structure.)",1314284779

I don't deal with trigonometry very often.  If the problem is in the context of a project where I will be using trigonometry frequently, I'll go refresh my memory about the easier-to-retain points in addition to what already I remember: sin(N * PI) = 0, sin((2N-1/2) = -1 and sin((2N+1/2) * PI) = 1 for integer N; given a unit circle and an angle between the line segment [(0,0), (0,1)] and another line segment reaching the circumference of that circle, sin(angle) = y, cos(angle) = x of that point (x,y) on the circle (this latter used as a mental-vision sanity check on any answer proposed).  If it's truly a one-off, I'll just use the calculator.",1314284640

I know it definitely happens in the sphere of enterprise software where it is usually smaller companies selling some software which large firms have found happens to suit their needs at a particular time. But I think establishing those kinds of interested contacts would take time and a careful awareness of opportunities.<p>It might be worth considering other possibilities in terms of generating revenue, perhaps by licencing the platform.<p>It is frustrating when you have a good piece of technology / application and you know it would be useful somewhere, but struggling to make that sale. If the economy was in better shape, larger companies would probably be much more willing to invest in full software / IP acquisition.<p>One other route is that of making some aspect open source but sell consultancy and support.<p>I would definitely be interested in any success stories of the kind you are hoping to achieve.",1314284487

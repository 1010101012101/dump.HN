The creator had a video with a functional light during the backing phase, so I assumed it was nearly complete, but sadly it wasn't the actual light we were backing in the video and development took a year longer than expected.

Monitor your weight across 4 weeks. If you aren't losing at a rate you're happy with, drop it to 1,800 calories per day.

4938320,comment,4937917,4938253,5,0,jdminhbg,,,"In Rails, ""models"" represent data (like a User or an Order), how they are saved to the database, and how they behave. ""Controllers"" coordinate pulling the correct models out of the database when they need to be rendered to HTML or other request.  The longstanding conventional wisdom regarding the two is ""fat model, skinny controller""; i.e., if you have complicated logic about for example which User can view which Orders, don't put that logic where you generate the page, but move it into the User object.<p>The problem is that eventually you get very fat models.  You can easily imagine how much behavior something as common as a User might have, and you get massive classes that act like junk drawers for can_view_order? and can_order_new_item? and has_archived_orders? etc.  DHH here is presenting a possible solution to that problem.

If I'm Will Wheaton and I post a photo of myself having a good time at Disney Land, I don't want Disney Land taking that photo and using it in their ads.

Maybe if you eat more than 2000 daily calories worth of stake and diary you get fat, but I can eat more than that without any effects whatsoever, while a single cookie ads 2 pounds on me (my body retains a lot of water after eating sugar).<p>And it's a problem because the common advice given to people doesn't work so well. Which is why dieting hasn't really caught on.<p>Personally I separate foods in dangerous (for me) and non-dangerous. I measure my weight every morning and I know precisely what types of food lead me to gain weight. For the non-dangerous kind I have no restrictions and eat as much as I please, as long as I don't combine it with the dangerous kind ... whenever I do that, I starve myself a little (for a day or so, eating some fruit and a yogurt), then it's back to normal.<p>Btw, I lost 44 pounds this year after cutting my sugar intake drastically + a dissociated diet that lasted for 4 months. Right now I'm happy that the diet is over and my weight has stabilized to the point that I eat whatever I like, except snacks (which I never liked anyway) and sugars.

It doesn't mean anything to the average American consumer that there are 1800 calories in that Starbuck's Mochaccino he just bought.

You weigh 180? And you just bought that 1800-calorie candy coffee?  Congratulations! you've achieved your maintenance goal for today.

You are thinking of the event horizon as a ""place in space"". It's not. It's an outgoing light ray. And ""locations"" with a given radius inside the horizon are not places in space either; they are moments of time.<p>Here's how to unpack what I just said in more detail. What kind of curve is a curve of constant r (and constant theta, phi if we include the angular coordinates)? Our ordinary intuition about how ""space"" works says that a curve of constant r is timelike; that is, it is a possible worldline for an object. This means that an object can ""stay in the same place"" by staying at constant r for all time.<p>If a black hole is present, however, this ordinary intuition is only valid outside the event horizon. Outside the horizon, curves of constant r are timelike. However, the event horizon is a curve of constant r, and it is <i>not</i> timelike: it's null. It's the path of an outgoing light ray. A light ray always moves at the speed of light; it can never ""stay in the same place"". So you can't think of the event horizon as ""a place in space"" the way you can think of a curve of constant r outside the horizon.<p>Inside the horizon, a curve of constant r is <i>spacelike</i>. The physical meaning of a spacelike curve is that it is the set of all events that happen ""at the same time"" for some observer. So a curve of constant r inside the horizon is ""a moment of time"" rather than ""a place in space"".<p>So a light ray that is emitted ""1 foot below the horizon"" is really emitted ""1 foot to the future of the horizon"". Or, since light travels about 1 foot per nanosecond, the light from your feet is emitted 1 nanosecond to the future of the horizon. That light can't travel ""upward"" to meet your feet; that would mean traveling into the past. Instead, your feet have to fall through the horizon to meet the light.",1355848719

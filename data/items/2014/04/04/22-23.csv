Now try to actually scan something with it.

Also, it&#x27;s pretty obvious (especially if you&#x27;ve used some language like Python already) that nobody writes everything from scratch these days, but there&#x27;re many libraries that proved to be useful.<p>And stuff like branching and cycles seems to be pretty obvious even for somebody without coding experience, as far as I can judge from what I&#x27;ve seen so far.

This very well could be on the commute home from work, later at night, etc.  With Dash sitting around the kitchen, Amazon has now created a very tangible reminder in the form of the Dash device to order your groceries, rather than waiting until it pops into your mind (and possibly not buying on Amazon).<p>(2) Average order size - As someone posted above, it takes 1 or 2 button clicks to reorder an item using Dash.  Compared to the current way of online grocery shopping, Dash eliminates a lot of possibilities of forgetting to reorder something you intended to, because it is so simple.  Compared to on the PC when you may forget to browse the snacks category, for example, and you forget to order chips and cookies.

This actually is a hassle, especially in states where the loan holder owns the title. You literally can&#x27;t just sign the title over to them. In most cases, the buyer has to pay for the car, the seller uses that payment to pay off the loan and then they get the title to transfer over. There has to be a ton of trust there. Even with a bill of sale, everyone is afraid of getting screwed. \n2. The straight craigslist process is not quite that easy, respond to emails, some of them from people not even really interested in the car. You have to go back and forth scheduling viewing and test drives. Roughly 40% of the time, you have to drive out to meet someone. If they no-show? Or low ball you? Or don&#x27;t want it? Time is wasted at all of these steps. \n3. Some people hate negotiating, and don&#x27;t know what a fair price is. We help.\n4. In Cali at least, you need Reg 262 for vehicle transfers.

The easier and faster Amazon can make it to order a new one, the more likely they are to get your business. If I&#x27;m cooking and I run out of flour, I&#x27;m not going to stop cooking, pull out my phone, unlock it, swipe over to the screen that has the Amazon app on it, tap that, wait for it to launch, click the button for Fresh, and then finally type (or speak). I&#x27;m just going to make a mental note and buy it later from Safeway.<p>But with Dash, it&#x27;s just grab the Dash from whatever convenient location you keep it, speak into the Dash, and put it back. That&#x27;s easy enough that I would do it, and Amazon would get my purchase.<p>Unfortunately, Amazon Fresh really kind of sucks (at least in SF), so the whole premise is flawed. Oh well.",1396649034

Generally you will upload your Eagle files or whatever and then watch a progress meter for the next board fill up over a week or so until it is ordered and shipped.

To put it in other words, the droplet of initial hybridization got diluted in the larger gene pool, but the novel genes (and thus traits) remained and underwent selection.<p>That being said, diluted gene contribution is not the same thing as no gene contribution. To even begin accepting such a theory I would require direct genetic evidence showing considerable horizontal gene transfer between porcine and hominid lines.",1396648902

I assume you mean a small neighborhood.<p>There are several ways to define these things.  For example, in a small neighborhood, the particles could move at a speed proportional (ish) to the distance from the point.  When you take 3D into account, some move tangentially, some move radially (ish) and it can all be smoothed out.  It's easiest to imagine the entirety, then try to extend the macro movement smoothly into the corners. By using tricks such as asymptotic slowing it can all be done.<p>Are you having trouble visualising?  Or are you worrying about the precise details.  This is not a good medium for discussing either.  A good text or tutorial on fluid mechanics will cover the various techniques for mapping an obvious flow into a less obvious flow.",1244879909

The story is the thread in their customer forum relating to the event.<p>Aside from the technical explanation, the thing that makes this story interesting is how their users (a significant portion of which can barely function without the site, being twitchy GTDers) reacted to all this. The predominant feeling in the forum responses is ""Hey, these things happen, never mind"".<p>In my experience, the toodledo folks could give lectures on customer-company interaction - their handling of their user forums has always been impeccable in  the year I have used them. I think this goes to show that if you treat your users right, they will really cut you some slack when the Bad Stuff happens.<p>A lesson some other services I use could usefully learn...",1244879827

There seems to be an inverse correlation between company size and the quality of design. I think Apple is almost pseudo-exception to this though, since their ID team has less than a dozen people. Or maybe it's just because their CEO has taste.<p>But a lot of the best design still goes completely unnoticed.  An object as simple as a Band-Aid might not evoke the same emotional response as a sleek aluminum MacBook or a Porsche 911, but I'd argue that its design is just as revolutionary and even more influential to the world.<p>Braun to me seems like Apple's older brother. Or at least just Dieter Rams.",1244879143

655943,comment,655243,655243,0,0,frossie,,," <i>A few clever online aggregators--YouTube? Hulu? Cable companies? Netflix?--will create nice video portals and build powerful new businesses.   At these portals, you'll be able to sign up to watch anything in the world on any device you want.  You'll be able choose among multiple subscription models (monthly, a la carte).</i><p>I would be quite positive about such a development. Unlike newspapers, I - and millions like me - pay a significant monthly outlay for TV (Dish in my case) for a lot of stuff I don't actually want (as opposed to my newspaper-reading self, who spends a lot less money for stuff I do want).<p>For example I pay a significant amount of money to subscribe to a foreign channel in which I only watch one program. I also subscribe to a motorsport channel so I can watch one series. I would be very happy to go a la carte - (eg. pay for programs I want to DVR). I probably would be okay with spending similar amounts of money for more shows I want to watch.<p>Also, TV has various successful pay models already including subscription (HBO) and PPV, which will probably translate a lot better onto the Internet than the newspapers models did.<p>That said, I do agree with the author that there will be a rearrangement of the landscape.",1244878099

Full Tilt is paying affiliates 20-30% life time commission on net earnings less fees, in addition to allowing for a small (2-3%) cut from sub-affiliates you refer. As an affiliate, you can incentivze the sign-ups however you'd like.<p>The way most affiliates incentivize you to use their affiliate link is by giving you a cut of the revenue.<p>How did you think it worked? Full Tilt giving rake back direct to players just because they signed-up thru some 3rd party link? Why would they do that?<p>The reason why some people who sign-up can't get rakeback and are told that ""their affiliate doesn't support rakeback"" is that some affiliates chose to get paid a flat CPA fee of $75-100 rather than a lifetime percentage.  This is also how PokerStars, etc, runs their programs.",1316624382

As insane as it sounds, this: ""solid businesses, great ideas, growing revenues, and strong earnings"" is actually going to be a red flag.<p>VCs want HUGE wins. ""Solid"" is not what they're going for. They also need to see the opportunity to take over the entire industry. I'm not a B2B guy but in consumer software that means you need to be on track to acquire millions of users.<p>Having solid revenues, models and a working cash flow system implies a certain amount of lock-in to the way you are doing things now. Are you on an exponential growth trend? If not, then anything standing between you and a pivot (like paying customers) is going to be a hurdle for the investors to get over.<p>As for the clubbyness -- you're damn right it's too clubby! It's an unfortunate fact that investors come from a pretty insular world. Thankfully if you can show traction, it's going to open a lot of doors that wouldn't open based on who you currently are (or are perceived to be). If you have a rapidly growing base of customers/users, investors will chase you down. If you don't, you need to reevaluate your desire for investment or your focus (traction, traction, traction!)",1316623359

The best parts of it are arguably the bits inherited from C (which C++11 looks like it might break with). The OOPy parts (classes, polymorphism, etc.) have been done better by languages like Java, Javascript, and Smalltalk. Templates exist to get around grossness of the rest of the language, and were done better by Java's generics anyways. Multiple inheritance was done better by Java in the form of interfaces.<p>The rhetoric is that these changes somehow simplify the language--that's cool and all, and may even be true for the most trivial of examples or the most basic of beginners. The problem is that these new features are going to be released in the wild alongside many libraries who don't use them, being old, and who won't be updated, being cumbersome or trusted. And so, the burden of making the ends meet is going to fall on the rest of us who now have to support, in effect, two languages.<p>If the improvements are incremental, then this wasn't worth doing, If the improvements are such a new, cleaner, simpler language, why the hell call it C++? Again, see D.<p>Lastly, most of the fixes are syntactic sugar which do nothing to help fix some very real issues with the deployment of the language.<p>How do I bind these things to other languages cleanly? In C this is trivial--why isn't this fixed in C++11?<p>How do I load libraries of classes dynamically at runtime? From C wrappers?<p>When interfacing with old libraries (which actually do exist), how often am I going to have to write some kind of NULL-nullptr glue code?<p>Why do we not have variable length arrays (they're in C99)?",1316623007

Just yesterday I was evaluating the new features of C++11, and I was pleasantly surprised by (1) the new language features, and (2) the extent of support already by existing compilers (gcc 4.4 and VC++ 2010).<p>I can see that we'll immediately benefit from a few improvements, such as auto variable, lambda support, standard support for unique/shared/weak_ptr. Even old school C++ users who have no interest in fancy new idioms would benefit from these ""syntactic sugar"" features found in other modern languages. There are a lot more that I'm still exploring, but so far I like what I saw.<p>Also these new features just work on the compilers. Given how long the standard process has been, a lot of the features were already baked in. Modern g++ and VC++2010 both have very good support. I listened to a BUILD presentation on C++ and the Microsoft folks are very committed to full C++11 compliance in VS11 (next version of Visual Studio), but AFAIK, VS2010 is already quite capable.<p>So, I agree, if you have a choice, switch NOW.",1316622157

Various upgrades to improve safety haven't changed this number,  since the ""unknown unknowns"" the dominant failure mode.<p>This failure rate,  of course,  was close to what we observed in experience.<p>What's funny about this is they were planning about 50 launches a year at the beginning,  which,  if they believed their own numbers,  would have mean the loss of a vehicle and crew every year,  and the complete destruction (or replacement?) of the Shuttle fleet on the time scale of five years or so.<p>The first failure (much like Three Mile Island) could be dismissed as a fluke,  a problem which could be fixed.  The second failure (like Fukushima) represented a typical failur e mode -- there was a lot of hand-wringing over the ceramic tiles on the first few shuttle flights,  and after a few flights without a disaster,  NASA assumed there was nothing to worry about,  and that was wrong.  The shuttle program was ended because there's no way to make the ceramic tiles safe.<p>Now,  Fukushima is an extreme case of a failure -- it was probably the worst built nuclear power plant in the most dangerous location,  but it represents the most likely LWR failure mode:  not a stuck valve or simple operator error,  but a major catastrophe that prevents cooling of the core and spent fuel.

Swift describes the Yahoos as vile and savage creatures, filthy and with unpleasant habits, resembling human beings far too closely for the liking of protagonist Lemuel Gulliver, who finds the calm and rational society of intelligent horses, the Houyhnhnms, far preferable. The Yahoos are primitive creatures obsessed with ""pretty stones"" they find by digging in mud, thus representing the distasteful materialism and ignorant elitism Swift encountered in Britain.

So, talk to a Facebook engineer about the challenges they go through to manage state between the front end, memcached, MySQL, etc.  Compare that to Twitter with the famous fail whale.  Compare that to Apple's store and the iTunes store which are written on WebObject (which is highly stateful.)  Lift apps running at scale typically require 7% of the front end resources of LAMP app.  The Lift apps that are running at scale (Foursquare and Novell pulse are two) do not have the kind of scaling issues associated with LAMP sites that have similar traffic patterns.  Scaling with Lift is neither tricky, nor risky.  It's simple.  It's known.  It's proven.

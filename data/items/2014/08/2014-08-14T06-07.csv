If you put yourself in the shoes of a police officer, you might understand the police&#x27; reluctance to stand up to a potentially armed and certainly aggressive mob without any protective gear, and in completely standard police cars.<p>The individual misconduct of these officers should be prosecuted. But these rioting mobs won&#x27;t stand a chance changing these &quot;bullying&quot; tactics or getting the police to &quot;demilitarize&quot;.<p>In some part, the protective gear actually decreases the need of applying violence against protesters, because the officers don&#x27;t have to defend themselves as &quot;actively&quot; when trying to control a crowd.",1407999522

Peaceful protestors that had once struck down any radical protestors suddenly turned radical themselves upon watching family and friends get beaten for filming and arrested for not obeying conflicting demands.

The local police chief said it would be used to patrol Keene’s “Pumpkin Festival and other dangerous situations”.<p>And worse:<p>> Householders, on hearing the door being smashed down, sometimes reach for their own guns. In 2006 Kathryn Johnston, a 92-year-old woman in Atlanta, mistook the police for robbers and fired a shot from an old pistol. Police shot her five times, killing her.

According to Poettering himself, in a recent talk[1], noted how systemd has already taken over:<p>&quot;init system, journal logging, login management, device management, temporary and volatile file management, binary format registration, backlight save/restore, rfkill save/restore, bootchart, readahead, encrypted storage setup, EFI/GPT partition discovery, virtual machine/container registration, minimal container management, hostname management, locale management, time management, random seed management, sysctl variable management, and console managment.&quot;<p>His roadmap for the next features to annex includes:<p><pre><code>    - DNS/DNSSEC, mDNS responder\n    - IPC (kernel code! (kdbus, etc))\n    - NTP\n    - More container integration, w/ new OS image format\n    - mandating layout of /usr /etc and /var\n    - &quot;Verifiable OS images&quot;\n      &quot;All the way to the firmware&quot;\n      &quot;Boot Loading&quot;\n      (good luck using custom kernels once\n       PoetteringOS starts requiring UEFI SecureBoot)\n    - (etc)\n</code></pre>\nDo <i>you</i> call that &quot;the fucking <i>init</i> system&quot;? There isn&#x27;t much left after that, and if past and current behavior is any judge, Poettering will probably expand that list over time.<p>> Or that it&#x27;s unique directory layout and symlink farm<p>That&#x27;s exactly the kind of thing that the systemd crowd is trying to prevent. See the part above where the current goal is to mandate the filesystem layout. Remember, it was Poettering himself that said that the goal of systemd was to &quot;...get rid of many of the more pointless differences of the various distributions...&quot;<p>> Obviously, you aren&#x27;t aware of the debian-devel thread on the matter.<p>Obviously, the author has read that threat (as have I). It was quite the experience, and is one of the most revealing threads I&#x27;ve seen regarding the abusive, manipulative, our-way-or-nothing methods used by the systemd camp.

They&#x27;re just one huge cabal...<p>No such claim was made. Debian has put itself in a situation where the freedom currently enjoyed will not be possible in the future. Systemd is forcing incompatibilities with the traditional Linux/Unix ways - on purpose - and they already have limited manpower. Siding with systemd will require either more manpower than they have, or dropping the &quot;old ways&quot;.<p>> ...the author is a long way from finding any answers...<p>Ahh, attacking the author. This type of tactic is pretty common from the systemd shills, as a method of shutting down the discussion. Instead of using this kind of rhetoric, I suggest actually reading up on the history of the current init situation.<p>Unless you actually <i>want</i> Linux to become a windows-style monoculture, incompatible with most traditional unix software - because removing &quot;old&quot; features and backwards compatibility is the <i>stated goal</i> of the larger &quot;CoreOS&quot;/systemd project.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTczNDk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTczNDk</a>",1407997965

I don&#x27;t think this Oracle chip is necessarily an indicator of that, but there are other signs indicating it could happen.<p>What you are saying is very true. Or at least it was true, 20 years ago when RISC was supposed to be the next big thing and then it wasn&#x27;t. But that landscape is finally starting to change.<p>What&#x27;s different now is that after dominating the server and desktop market through brute force, Intel hit a saturation point about 10 years ago and since then, clock speeds haven&#x27;t increased much, nor have instructions per cycle, both of which were increasing so fast year-on-year through the 90s and early 2000s that nobody could keep up. Now even Intel have been forced to start scaling out horizontally by adding more cores: that&#x27;s now virtually all that differentiates their fastest CPUs from their slowest.<p>Because of this, developers are increasingly having to think more about writing concurrent code. Languages like Go, F#, Scala and Clojure are seeing a huge upsurge in popularity lately; it&#x27;s not happenstance. Functional programming has been largely confined to AI and CS research since the 60s, but it&#x27;s suddenly becoming popular with pragmatists for scalability.<p>The thing is, once your code is no longer bound by single-threaded performance, it starts making sense to just add more cores if you can, especially if you can do so without a significant transistor cost. With x86, adding cores is expensive because each one is exceptionally complex, but RISC can be simpler, use fewer transistors and operate at lower wattage. Huge numbers of cores can also be exceptionally power efficient if each core can run in a low power mode until needed.",1407997101

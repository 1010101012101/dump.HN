250991,comment,250760,250932,0,0,kobs,,,"Please inform me on how following YC's model is not a Good Thing. YC is clearly not omnipresent (and has an upperbound on the number of companies they are able to devote resources to), so who cares if someone else decides to start something similar?<p>I don't understand the criticism thrown at those starting ventures similar to YC. Correct me if I'm wrong, but providing people with an opportunity to ""make something people want"", create wealth, and do something they enjoy hardly seems deplorable. I personally love to hear of new opportunities similar to YC (especially in other countries). The more the merrier.",1216511804
250990,comment,250704,250864,0,0,swombat,,,"No, I think you're misunderstanding my statement.<p>I did not say that people do not have new ideas. That is a blatantly ridiculous statement. I said that <i>worthy</i> ideas have already been had.<p>My argument comes from looking at literary and philosophical ideas, and my comment was a jest in response to another jest, but there's truth in it. There's a persistent quest for originality in literature, and after some years of chasing that particular ghost I came to the conclusion that it's an illusion. All the great subjects, all the great ideas, have been had already. That doesn't make a book written today less valuable, because what I would add to whichever idea I decide to write about is my own, unique perspective on it. But it means that trying to come up with some completely original idea for a book is pointless - if it's ""completely original"" it is probably worthless. If ten of thousand years of human civilisation have not yet produced that idea in any form, there's probably a good reason.<p>Hence my statement that ideas <i>worth having</i> have been had a thousand times already.<p>So, rather than chasing originality in writing, I think it's more worthwhile to enrich my perspective so that what I add to whatever ancient kernel I might pick is actually worth adding.<p>Now, extending this to start-up ideas, as you well know, if you have a brilliant idea for a start-up, chances are someone has already had that idea somewhere in the world. If no one has had it at all out of 6 billion people, chances are it's not brilliant, and probably not worth pursuing. Moreover, most great business ideas are not ""original"", but twists on existing ideas, putting an existing concept into a new perspective. So even the first person to come up with a new twist is still just coming up with a new twist. As with books, though, it doesn't matter whether your idea is original, what matters is what you put into it (the execution, basically). I think this is in agreement with your articles.<p>Businesses exist to fulfil human needs. The idea of fulfilling human needs is as old as human needs themselves. The ways of doing so are just as old. Social networking, for example, might be a new twist on the idea of helping people make and keep friends, but it's still fulfilling the human need for friendship, something which thousands of other businesses do too.<p>So, again, rather than striving to come up with a truly original start-up idea, I think it's more worthwhile to hone my ability to take whatever idea I do decide to run with and make it into a working business.",1216511474
250989,comment,250930,250961,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Agreed with the rest of the replies here about Marx and Freud, but what's with the detraction of Hegel because he's ""hard to read""? Lisp is pretty hard to read too when you've only read C-style syntax before.<p>And I think you can most definitely call a philosophy wrong, philosophers do it routinely!  At its core philosophy is simply making good arguments, something that HN posters should be striving for.  And while it's hard to ""prove"" a philosophy wrong in the sense one can prove that an algorithm doesn't work, you can certainly prove its arguments to be unsound.<p>There is the ongoing strict separation between ""Continental"" and ""Analytic"" philosophy, which is both relatively new and quite tragic.  I will say that in a discipline like philosophy, which when it is at its best treasures subversiveness and independence just as much as entrepreneurs do,  it's all the more important to read thinkers from different schools of thought.  Hegel is not just any ""Continental"" philosopher but one of the most important pillars of the field",1216511456

250985,comment,250935,250935,0,0,aantix,,,"Just to add my own story to the article.<p>I've always been a heavier guy, even with exercise and proper dieting.  A couple years back I had issues with extremely high blood pressure spikes.  It landed me in the hospital for a few days.<p>After my wife watched a medical show on Discovery Channel she came to me one day and says ""Maybe you should get checked for sleep apnea?""<p>At that time on most weekends I could sleep for 13 hours straight and wake up still feeling exhausted.<p>Went and had a sleep study done and the results showed that I woke up over 150 times throughout the night and never entered REM sleep.  With a CPAP machine I awoke only once.<p>The CPAP has change my life.  Because I have more quality sleep I have more energy for exercising and have dropped another 20 lbs because of it. I work out 4-5 times a week.  My quality of life has improved ten-fold.<p>So if you're a larger person that feels like the energy is drained from you, has problems getting the motivation to follow through on a physical fitness plan, and _especially_ if you're a loud snorer, you should get a sleep study done.<p>While wearing a CPAP to bed isn't going to get you laid, you'll quickly realize how much life you've been missing out on because of your poor sleep.",1216511081

250971,comment,250792,250792,0,0,jrockway,,,"People seem to like blaming Rails for things that aren't Rails' fault.  The stuff that's probably using CPU time is actually generating the image.  Getting the data from the user and into the database via a CRUD interface probably doesn't require that much hardware.  If it did, that would be a joke, but I doubt that's the problem.  (Just like Twitter's problem isn't reading the ""What am I doing"" form submission and adding it to the database.  The hard part is what happens <i>after</i> that, way outside of Rails' control.)<p>As for the large number of static image servers, that again has nothing to do with Rails.<p>Anyway, I doubt changing languages would fix the problem.  You'd still bottleneck on MySQL (for extracting data), and generating images (since every language uses the same image libraries; all written in C anyway).<p>In conclusion, without some more data, the author is clueless.",1216509879

And their <i>ideas</i> are not necessarily irrelevant to the psychologist (childhood traumas <i>can</i> cause persisting psychological problems) or economist. But their actual works probably are irrelevant to the work of most psychologists and economists.<p>Hegel expelled from philosophy? First, his works are particularly difficult to read and understand (and difficult to translate into English). So he isn't popular with philosophy undergraduates.

Set out a schedule (say, every quarter) that you'll use to decide who deserves what portion of the equity.  Have guidelines around work expectations and performance goals, and include a 3rd party in your meetings if you need to.<p>That way you can closely tie compensation to performance, and there are no surprises because each party to the agreement knows what to expect (even if you both work with 65/35 in mind).<p>It sounds bizarre, but it's not so uncommon in practice.

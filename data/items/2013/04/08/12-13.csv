5511371,comment,5510914,5511035,26,0,igravious,,,"I picked up Steven Pinker's <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature</i> the other day and I have to say that it allows me to view this whole episode quite clearly.<p>Pinker documents the increasing ratcheting down of violence in humanity, perhaps not in absolute terms but certainly in percentage of population terms. Take modern Western Europe, it has statistically the lowest homicide rate compared to anywhere and any time.<p>The decrease in violence has occurred with what Pinker calls Rights Revolutions at two points in history, around about the time of the American and French revolution and mid-twentieth century onwards. So we have people asserting the rights of man in general leading to the abolition of chattel slavery, the rights of woman in particular, gay rights, the rights of children, and recently the rights of animals. In England the last blood sport (fox hunting) was recently outlawed in the teeth of much protest from the good old boys that think cruelty to animals is A OK.<p>These rights revolutions stem from ideas born out the Age of Reason and the Age of Enlightenment which led most famously the amendments to the US constitution but which have there parallel in most of the Western world. Forces that work against these ideas are thus called counter-enlightenment forces. Getting back to the issue at hand (I've got a point I tells ya!) these laws represent a back-sliding and we should take these counter-enlightenment forces very seriously - we are talking about a centuries long struggle to eliminate violence (of whatever type) from our societies. I guarantee you that future generations will look back at our times and recoil in horror at the way we treat animals in much the same way that systemic torture, bear-baiting, corporal punishment, domestic abuse and so on leave most of us (apart from the odd sadist and sociopathic outlier)  sickened nowadays.<p> I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Animal cruelty is definitely not okay, but I have noticed a growing trend of reporting best practices, <i>that attempt to minimize animal suffering as much as possible</i>, as animal cruelty. And the solutions people are coming up with to improve on those best practices are as non-sensical as a non-industry expert suggesting that we write software in English.

How much hard did that do to other industries.  My grandfather at the time an electrical engineer lost his job due rather directly to the 3 day week.<p>For people like them Thatcher was a good thing, ultimately it was not her fault that the unions did not want to compromise on closing mines.

True, Britain completely destroyed the industrial might it had in the first half of the XX century. It gained, in the process, European leadership in finance.<p>A number of questions arise, of course. Does finance employ the same people that worked in factory floors? No. Is finance sustainable in the long term? I doubt it, as it is much more mobile than manufacturing (Germany is attacking the British stronghold in finance). Would manufacturing decline anyway? Possibly; in the US it did, but in Germany it didn't. In the end, it is always a game of what-ifs.<p>Anyhow, I'm not in the position to have a sustained opinion on Thatcher's policies.

I clearly remember watching her enter Downing St and my mother telling me that things were going to get better now a woman was in charge.<p>She oversaw wrenching shifts in Britain's social and economic structures, was hated, respected, but rarely loved and kicked out without ceremony.<p>But my abiding memories are of <i>something</i> getting done.  Rarely were there somethings that everyone agreed upon, rarely was it done well, but things were done.  Thatcher had an agenda when she came to power.  Her ""success"" over the Falklands enabled her to push that agenda - one of massive economic change.  It seemed obvious and overdue to her and her main advisors that the semi-Keynesian establishment needed shaking up.  And she and her band of, at the time, outsiders, did just that.  Something happened.  Something inevitable.<p>In the deadlocked worlds of politics I see in the UK and US, this is a trait that might be worth admiring.<p>But now in my own middle age, well, if I were PM now, my personal focus would be on the changes needed to deal with the Internet as the Central nervous system of humankind - issues of privacy, of government accessibility, of security of networks and national assets, of education policy.  Those are my ""Bleedin obvious"" policy shifts.  Things I would drive home ruthlessly, because not to do so would be like a time traveller knowing the all the days winning horses and still not betting.<p>So, to sum up, doing <i>something</i> in politics takes a special kind of ruthlessness.  Sometimes we need to have people who will sacrifice others in order to make the inevitable happen now - there are many mining towns feeling the sacrifice to this day.<p>But we need now not to debate the issues of 1980, but to look at the next inevitable changes - and do our best to get ahead of them.  Much of the Eurozone troubles are down to the countries missing a Thatcher, and having politicians who simply waited till the inevitable happened.

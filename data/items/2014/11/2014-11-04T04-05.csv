8555206,comment,8554440,8554440,0,0,whiddershins,,,"What&#x27;s odd to me is trying to discuss Uber in NYC by comparing to yellow cabs. We have a thing in NY called &quot;car services&quot; which basically everyone uses, and which are much more comparable to Uber than taxis are. You call a car, they come to your house, they pick you up, and they take you where you want to go for a predetermined price.<p>In general, the car services I take are cheaper than Uber or metered taxis. But not always. And they can be a little more annoying to deal with than just using an app on your phone. Certainly Uber would be far less intimidating for tourists.<p>Plus Uber was able to pick me up in the rain on Halloween, because of surge pricing. And they only charged me triple!<p>But seriously: if you are talking about Uber in New York and not mentioning Arecibo car service, which has several hundred of cars all over the city at all times of the day and night, and is one of many such services in operation, you are missing a huge part of the equation.",1415077036
8555205,comment,8554996,8554996,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"The difficulty with these semi-classical interpretations of quantum phenomena is that they tend to work nicely for a few very simple cases and fall to bits when things get more complex. Bohm&#x27;s quantum potential works almost perfectly for single electron atoms, in which the quantum potential simply holds the electron still, but falls apart for multi-electron atoms, which require a higher dimensional space for the quantum potential to live.<p>Although Bell did defend pilot wave theory--which is taught in every introductory QM course and covered in every introductory QM text--he himself did not see it as anything more than an inspiration for a more complete interpretation, which would necessarily be non-local in accordance with the theorem that bears his name.<p>My own belief is that pilot waves cannot account for quantum statistics, and therefore cannot account for the heat capacity of solids: <a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=470"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=470</a> There is a claim that pilot wave theory somehow deals with this, but the argument is focused on the decay of radioactive particles rather than thermodynamics, which seems to be odd, because the thermodynamic argument is the fundamental one: the heat capacity of solids is an unequivocal way of counting available states, and if hidden variables (such as the &quot;true&quot; positions and momenta of the piloted particles) exist then they break the symmetry under exchange that gives rise to the statistics we observe, and create additional states that would... hmmm...<p>OK, having thought about it for a bit I&#x27;m no longer <i>entirely</i> convinced it&#x27;s impossible that pilot waves might preserve the symmetry while also preserving identity. It would require that exchanging the labels on the pilot waves precisely compensate for the labels on the particles. Would that be enough? I&#x27;m going to have to think more about this before forming a more firmly held opinion on it.",1415077005

- Previously wrote satellite flight software for the Taiwanese space agency, jumped into mobile apps and haven&#x27;t looked back since. 
- Was iOS lead for one of the top navigation apps in Taiwan:

- Did almost all of the development work for a local EV charge station info app:

- Also scratched a few itches of my own:

- There are also others which I&#x27;m not at liberty to disclose. 
- Also have done work in Ruby (Rails, Sinatra), Python, HTML/CSS, but prefer iOS work for now.<p>Why you should work with me:
- I keep up with most of the latest framework updates, was in SF for WWDC/altConf this year. (Although prefer not to work in Swift for now, personal projects only) 
- I stay current with design trends and industry news. Core Intuition, DF, objc.io, all that good stuff. I know my shxt.
- Clear English communication. No worries about whether your point got across or not. This is crucial in remote work settings, I think.<p>We&#x27;d work together with great results if you&#x27;re pretty clear what it is you want done and what the scope of the project is. Handwavey functionality requirements are hard to implement right in the best situations, in remote work it will probably result in surprises and hurt feelings on both sides. Small/medium projects where the goal is clearly defined tend to work best.<p>Rate: 300 USD/day (straightforward projects using established frameworks). Yes, it&#x27;s relatively low, but decent for living in Taipei. I don&#x27;t expect it to stay that way forever, though. I track time in half-day increments.<p>LinkedIn: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/raytsaihong"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/raytsaihong</a>

(http://goo.gl/cuAjXj) &quot;Surprice&quot; is a photo sharing app just like Instagram. But the difference is that we have price tags on the image.
We all know that people like to take photos (of their delicious foods, new wearings, fancy interior items) and share them in Instagram. But more than just sharing the photos, we thought about something cool. That it might be more helpful if we add the price informations on the image. Just like the magazines.<p>Have you ever thought of any unfairness caused by gap of reaching price informations? We believe that &quot;Surprice&quot; will become the &#x27;Price Wikipedia&#x27; that anyone can easily get the price informations. With the shared informations, consumers will become wiser, and this will drive us to new consumer culture.<p>We are just a small Korean startup, consist of seven members. After we launched our app at market, we are keep asking acquaintances to give us feedbacks that which part of the app we should improve. But here&#x27;s a problem. We want our service to be a globalized, but until now all the advisers were Koreans.<p>So before we start marketing, we need more feedbacks from various users, like you, about the things we should fix.
We want to ask,<p>1. The app&#x27;s name &quot;Surprice&quot; - does it give you any weirdness or oddness? Like we(Koreans) don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s strange or not.<p>2. Is it enough to understand the service with the descriptions and screenshots at market?<p>3. While using the app , at the point of view of UI/UX, which function should be fixed first?<p>4.

It seems to completely discount surge pricing, which would likely change these numbers significantly.<p>2. It assumes that taxi and Uber behavior is very similar, but this seems pretty dubious for 2 major reasons:<p>a. In dense areas it&#x27;s far more convenient to use a taxi than an Uber (you can hail one in a minute or two), while in less populated areas it&#x27;s far more convenient to get an Uber. This would definitely skew Uber significantly towards longer, speedier trips.<p>b. Uber likely sees a greater proportion of utilization from airport rides. For an expensive trip like that, people are more price conscious and most New Yorkers know it&#x27;s usually much cheaper to take Uber. When juxtaposed against the prospect of waiting in line for a ~$60 + tip taxi ride, the immediacy of a $63 Uber looks <i>very</i> appealing. Additionally, I imagine Uber is seeing disproportionate growth amongst tourists (who might already be using Uber elsewhere but are intimidated by hailing NYC taxis).",1415074374

I&#x27;m sure that I know less about the subject than everyone interviewed in in the article. If anything, I think knowledge makes it better, since you&#x27;re not likely to be mislead by it.<p>Wrt relativistic effect, the first NIST paper I cited shows that they needed altitude uncertainty less than 1m to avoid redshift from dominating the clock&#x27;s error. The second shows that for the improved F2 reference redshift is one of the largest sources of uncertainty (and the corrected part is orders of magnitude larger than the other listed systemic errors).  It&#x27;s really cool, I agree.  I&#x27;m happy to have people share in enjoying that, but sad about whatever causes the press to always have to present things as new and categorically different than what came before.<p>There are a number of really cool things they didn&#x27;t mention:  For example, these optical lattice clocks that they&#x27;re talking about are solid state-- involving mostly only lasers and vacuum cells. Unlike cesium based atomic clocks, they may have reasonable prospects of being mass produced inexpensively in the future, and efforts to do this are being funded by DARPA (useful for many military applications, like jamming systems and anti-jamming, navigation, and various sensing applications). So unlike the state of the art atomic references these things may someday show up in very inexpensive equipment, and allow for some fun science experiments, improvements to reliable distributed systems, long baseline amateur radio astronomy, etc.<p>Or, Tom Van Baak measuring gravitational redshift with a minivan and some old HP cesium beam clocks. okay, not &quot;floor to wall&quot;, but if you haven&#x27;t read his presentation on it, you should, it&#x27;s a load of fun and IMO, more accessible in that it&#x27;s not talking about technology that exists in a rats nest of cables on an optical table in a single lab, but just old junk you can find surplus. :)",1415074216

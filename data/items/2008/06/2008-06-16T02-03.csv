I agree that the threadstarter is wrong, but explaining your viewpoint and why you think he's wrong contributes far more to the discussion than unnecessary personal attacks.",1213585074

218337,comment,218226,218304,0,0,imgabe,,,"So, do you have an example of an implementation that doesn't have this problem or are you just assuming one exists? If there is one, it must be a well kept secret, because there hasn't yet been a social news site that's adopted it.<p>One I've considered is to temporarily suspend down voting after submitting a story. But this has some unintended consequences in that it unfairly penalizes the people who submit heavily, who provide a lot of value to the site.<p>Your assumption that people ordinarily upvote submissions they like isn't necessarily valid. I usually read the site pretty passively, and only upvote things I think are really spectacular. It doesn't mean I don't like the other things I read, just that they didn't really blow me away.<p>""counter to the idea of upvoting"" is a pretty vague phrase. Counter to your idea maybe, my criteria for upvoting fits my idea of upvoting just fine. Not everyone thinks of a vote the same way, as another story on the front page right now points out, this is one of the problems with a site like this.",1213582791

""64bit"" doesn't change the APIs, at most it should take a recompile to build against the x86-64 version of the libraries.

218334,comment,218021,218180,0,0,serhei,,,"There is actually a consistent inverse correlation between development level and fertility rate. Economically affluent countries have lower fertility.<p>This suggests that improving the standard of living is the most, perhaps the only, humane way of dealing with the population problem. Other measures, even measures like China's ""One Child Policy"", tend to have unanticipated repercussions. (Example: everybody in China wants a boy, to such a degree that some families end up abandoning newborn girls out on a street somewhere, if not resorting to downright infanticide.)<p>So the argument that raising Africa's standard of living will worsen the population explosion doesn't really hold water; the exact opposite argument can also be made.",1213582041

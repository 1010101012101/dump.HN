My second political idea (gotten from &quot;crossing the chasm&quot;) is that you don&#x27;t kickstart platforms, you start a killer application and if you get success, you open it to third parties, you can&#x27;t start as a platform, you mutate into it.<p>What I have seen happen tho, is sales people pressured or rewarded for either the generated revenue or the gross margin they generate. The easiest way to generate a sale is by selling man hour, because the delivery date is set, it can be quick at the quarter&#x27;s or fiscal year&#x27;s end, and there is no real fiddly evaluation of the delivered features (the consultant was there or not). The other trope is that sales people are attracted by big companies (for the brand recognition and the gross margin), where investments are complex and slow to move on, but man hours are bought on the running budget, not on investment, and the sale can move way quicker.<p>And so, by selling man hours at famous big co, you can put a logo and some revenue on your investor&#x27;s slides.

A few years ago I realized that if I continue down this path, I&#x27;ll end up with some serious health issues due to the stresses that come along with having a reputation for being a really good developer.<p>So, I decided that instead of searching for developers better than me, I would teach developers I work with how to BE better.

8649414,comment,8648437,8648437,0,0,Animats,,,"Somehow, attempts to bolt message passing onto Linux never seem to be very good. Probably because the primitives underneath are a poor match.<p>QNX, which is a real-time microkernel, got message passing more or less right.  You connect to a port of another process. Then you send with MsgSend, which sends a message of N bytes, and waits for a reply. So it&#x27;s like a procedure call.<p>The receiving end (considered the server) does MsgReceive, which blocks waiting for work, gets the bytes, and returns a reply with MsgReply.  That&#x27;s QNX messaging.<p>Everything goes through this, including all I/O. It&#x27;s very fast, and integrated with the CPU scheduler, so most message passes just transfer control to the other end without scheduling delay. This allows rapid tossing of control back and forth between processes without going to the end of the line for CPU time.<p>Because QNX is a real-time OS, there are some additional features.  Messages are ordered by thread priority, so real-time requests are serviced ahead of non-real time.  (This works well enough that running a compile or a browser doesn&#x27;t impact hard deadline real-time work.) Any request can have a timeout, in case the other end has a problem. Finally, when a MsgSend from a high priority process goes to a lower-priority process, the receiving process gets the higher priority until the MsgReply, to avoid priority inversion.<p>Linux messaging almost always goes through unidirectional byte pipes of some sort.  So you need a protocol just to figure out where the message boundaries are.  D-Bus seems to be struggling with that.  Building a call-like mechanism on top of unidirectional pipes means that callers do a write followed by a read. For a moment, between the write and the read, both sender and receiver are ready to run. This means a trip through the scheduler, or worse, starting the receiving process on a different CPU and suffering cache misses.<p>It&#x27;s one of those things where the wrong primitives at the bottom cascade into layers of complexity above.",1416766978

I&#x27;ve decided I want to sell my share. I now have to find someone willing to buy it. The spread alone guarantees I&#x27;m not going to get $1 for it.</i><p>Congratulations, you&#x27;ve found a way to extract free money from the market:<p>Cenario A: The transaction happens and the price is now above 1$. Great, there is now at least one person out there willing to buy a share for more than 1$. The initial shareholders should be ecstatic, just taking 90$ in exchange for 90 shares has allowed them to sell at least one share for more than 1$, whereas yesterday they could only get 1$ for them. Free money!<p>Cenario B: The transaction happens and the price is now below 1$. Great, there is now at least one of the shareholders (new or old) that is willing to sell one or more shares for less than 1$. Take 1$ from the 90$ you just raised and buy back the share. The remaining shareholders get to keep the change. Free money!<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that movements in price can&#x27;t accompany capital raises. But what causes that movement isn&#x27;t the transaction itself it&#x27;s what it means. If a bank suddenly announces it has raised capital to cover larger than expected loan defaults the share price will decrease, because of the defaults not the capital raising transaction. If a manufacturing company announces it has raised capital to increase it&#x27;s capacity in a booming market, the price may very well rise, not because of the capital raise, but because the expectation is that the company will be more profitable in the future.<p>The point, and this is my final comment, is that raising capital doesn&#x27;t by itself change the share price of the company, but what the transaction implies may very well do. In the bank case the revelation of past problems lowers the price, in the manufacturing example the expectation of future profits does. Never the transaction itself which is the same in both cases.<p><i>> For anyone who&#x27;s followed this long, read &quot;Security Analysis&quot; by Benjamin Graham for real insights instead of this incomplete thought experiment gone awry.</i><p>The book recommendation sounds great to me.

I just tried it but unfortunately it&#x27;s not any better than the others - even over LAN at 1280x720 with &quot;optimize for speed&quot; enabled, it&#x27;s still not anywhere near usable. (I also verified, with a packet capture, that communication was on my LAN and not proxied through a TeamViewer intermediary server.)",1416765882

I have to <i>really</i> force myself to see the positive side of how all this technology that we have is being used. The tools we have built to exchange information are being used to track us both by industry and governments, the software development environments are getting more and more complex and frankly ridiculous (compatibility testing for well over 25 browsers in order to make sure your <i>documents</i> can be read by others in the way you intended?), coffeemakers and printers with DRM and so on.<p>But then I remind myself to look at:<p><pre><code>  - wikipedia\n\n  - the Khan Academy (though they&#x27;ve started spamming!)\n\n  - Google search (you can keep the rest)\n\n  - Open Access journals\n\n  - Linux\n</code></pre>\nAnd a whole raft of good stuff and I feel better again.",1416765878

If you precede an indexOf statement with a tilde, it essentially turns `indexOf` into `contains`.<p><pre><code>    if(~someStringOrArray.indexOf(searchTerm))\n</code></pre>\nIt works because indexOf returns the index the term is found at, or -1 if it isn&#x27;t found. This means 0 is actually a successful result, but Boolean(0) = false. But bitwise NOT will clear all of that up:<p><pre><code>    ~(-1) = 0 (evaluates as false)\n    ~(0) = -1 (evaluates as true)\n</code></pre>\nEdit: I&#x27;m not suggesting everyone go off and use ~indexOf all the time - I was simply sharing a related javascript bitwise &quot;trick&quot;.",1416765861

8649360,comment,8648166,8648213,0,0,mistercow,,,"For lossless compression, start out by reading up on run length encoding, which is about as simple as it gets. Then there&#x27;s DEFLATE, which is what&#x27;s behind gzip. You&#x27;ll also want to read up on Huffman coding and arithmetic coding. One of the newer ideas in lossless compression is &quot;context mixing&quot;, which is definitely worth reading up on. The Burrows–Wheeler transform is pretty fascinating, albeit slow, so you might want to read about that as well.<p>Lossy compression (which RegPack is actually an example of), typically involves lossless compression plus a preprocessing step to discard information so that the lossless compressor can do a better job.<p>The techniques for discarding information vary based on application. For images and audio, the most successful techniques tend to involve working in frequency space, so you&#x27;ll want to read up on the FFT and related transforms.<p>For code compression, you have different constraints when discarding information because you have to produce a program with identical output to the original. Simple techniques involve removing comments and renaming variables to have shorter names. More advanced techniques involve more complex transformations of the AST, including language-specific tricks like wrapping javascript in a &quot;with(Math){}&quot; block.<p>Hope some of that helps.",1416765815

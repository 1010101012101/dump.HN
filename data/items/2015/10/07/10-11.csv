So why do that to Reddit at all?<p>When I go to reddit, I want entertainment. To do this I follow rule 5 of the Pentabarf: &quot;A Discordian is Prohibited of Believing What he Reads.&quot;. This is how the page works out for me. From this point of view all that stress that happened recently seems pretty ridiculous to me. It seemed like they decided to tar the garden. Because after that you can be sure what will be in the area. Parked cars. If you now put a shopping mall next to it, it will still work, people will go there and hang out because there is not much else to do. But I don&#x27;t see that as a creative pool anymore and it will bore me at some point. I&#x27;m pretty sure about it.<p>On the other hand there is this opportunity that grew with the Pao disaster. As far as I could see there is not one portal that came up with an real alternative that would catch &quot;the spirit&quot;. Instead we got the hate-reddit and some hipster-reddits all in protection-mode just like Reddit today. Everyone is managing this their way (by circlejerking, minimum vote count which leads to more circlejerking or invite only).<p>This is no development of a culture that would participate in your &quot;forum of the world&quot;. This is just a poor recap of real life politics. Their sides, dogmas and means to protect their world view. Killing everything that might threaten it on a meta-level.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure the Post-Snowden Internet we have today is even the right medium. I don&#x27;t want my political views profiled and sold to the highest bitter. I don&#x27;t want to give power to bot networks, circle jerks, SJWs, etc. We are still unable to cope with this groups within a entertainment network, how should we get them to interact on really relevant topics without just banning them from participation?

Do my transmissions to them get stored in an EU data center and their transmissions to me get stored in a US data center?

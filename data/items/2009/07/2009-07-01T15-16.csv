While the SO code is likely not the <i>simplest possible</i> code, it is likely that it is within an order of magnitude.

SO is definitely not a complicated site, architecturally speaking. But as he points out, it's a very polished site. This may not be important for a programmer, but it is for an user (it is for me as an user at least), as he also points out.<p>Regarding the amount of work wich probably has gone into it, your original statement :<p>>it looks like something that can be thrown together in a weekend.<p>surely sounds disrespectful to the labor of those guys.<p>I'm also quite amazed by the general reaction to this. I don't understand how some commenters on hn, wich is supposed to be oriented towards entrepreneurs, who are by definition people interrested by the end user experience, could so quickly discard in several largely upvoted comments the work that has been put by those individuals, by saying that their success is just due to 'owners reputation'.<p>This is amazingly rude, and seems to be going along just fine.<p>When you provoke an argumentated and well thought out reaction as this one, you should ask yourself, before saying some people takes things too seriously, maybe you're taking what is important to them too lightly. And that's your responsability, not theirs.<p>EDIT: This is not to say your challenge is not a nice one. I'll be interrested to see how it works out =)",1246461603

1) Coworker familiar with Python
2) I had an easier time understanding the mechanics of Django than I did Rails
3) Some libraries I needed were only in Python<p>However, from a language point of view, I have a slight preference towards Ruby. Here are some things I like:
1) More consistent commitment to object paradigm, e.g. all function calls are actually method calls on an object. In Python, everything is an object, but sometimes you use methods, and sometimes you don't, e.g. list.pop() vs. len(list).
2) I think blocks are very handy.
3) I like the more Perlish regex syntax.
4) There is a cleverness to Ruby that might not be the best thing for a corporate environment, but it makes it fun.<p>So, if I was writing code just for myself, I might choose Ruby over Python, assuming performance and library support were sufficient.",1246461566

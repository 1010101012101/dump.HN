If your music can be heard outside your earphone it must be very loud. For your own auditory health sake turn it down. Even if you are using it to isolate from the office noise, once you lose your hearing you cannot get it back so it is not worth it to sacrifice it for short term gain.<p>2. Regarding all the misbehaviour towards your other coworkers, don&#x27;t interfere. A lot like in domestic abuse cases, sometimes the victims end up taking the aggressor&#x27;s side and you end up in a situation of both the aggressor and the victims being against you. Just don&#x27;t.<p>3. The kind of abuse you are being subjected is not tolerable and the best way to stop it (as others said) is to quit the job. It is very unlikely that there is a course of action that will result in you keeping your job and your abusive boss getting fired.<p>4. People failed to understand the depth of your problem: if you can&#x27;t afford to eat properly you can&#x27;t afford to pay for a lawyer and probably you don&#x27;t have the spare time to find one out that will take your case pro bono or on contingency. If you could, the best course of action would still be to quit.<p>Now is the part of the advice that will really suck because it assumes a flawed world where doing the right thing don&#x27;t always pay out and doing the wrong thing isn&#x27;t always punished.<p>Being totally honest here: (as per your other post) you took a PHP job not being in touch with the technology for the past 8 years. You took a Windows shop job being a Linux person for the past 15 years. It is very hard to understand  how you got the job in the first place given the lack of technological fit and they will probably treat you as a stop gap until they can find someone more qualified.<p>If your situation is so dire that you were willing to fill the position anyway and if you can&#x27;t afford to quit a job that in the second day you already found out that is not for you: you will have to muster the strength and carry on.<p>- Block out all external stimulus not related to your task at hand<p>- Don&#x27;t talk to your coworkers except for task related subjects.<p>- Don&#x27;t listen to your coworkers conversations.<p>- Don&#x27;t observe your boss comments or behaviour.<p>- Don&#x27;t respond to abusive comments.<p>- Hide your feelings as well as you can, fake a convincing laugh and keep at your task.<p>- Don&#x27;t spend a single additional second of your own time the presence of abusive people<p>- Do your job as well as is necessary to receive your paycheque and count the days until you can finally quit.<p>These are not idealist advice, it is very unlikely that you are going change that workplace environment, save your coworkers or win a big lawsuit. But if you can&#x27;t absolutely quit that job (and, assuming conditions as bad as you describe, I would even if the alternative was hunger and homelessness) pretend, fake and carry on as well as you can in this situation.<p>And sorry for the long post.",1433990400

People worked on some interesting stuff during them, but very little of it was meant to be production ready and useful (vs toy) projects saw little exposure outside of the company or the engineering department itself.  Lots of things were meant only to scratch our own developer itches or impress co-workers, like internal engineering tools (which have their own value).  I attribute this to &quot;yelp the public facing product/service&quot; having a master plan that is determined outside of engineering proper—nothing wrong with that, it is what it is.  So if you had some cool idea to, for example, revamp the UI/UX of the business photos page, you could work on that during the hackathon, but it was only a hackathon project.  This encouraged people to work on throwaway toy projects or experiment with deep backend stuff during hackathons to blow off steam vs something that someone could point to publicly.  Not to say that no hackathon projects ever were exposed non-internally, but it was a <i>very</i> small percentage.  Some people used hackathons to catch up on regular work while many other people were working on hackathon projects.

A lot of it comes down to having good hiring managers that know how to evaluate a candidate based on their alignment to the company goals and the role they are being hired for.<p>Reid Hoffman wrote a great piece recently calling for a change in the company/employee relationship from &quot;join our family&quot; to &quot;help us while improving your skills&quot;. He said that a standard interview question at LinkedIn is (paraphrasing) &quot;What would be your ideal role after you leave LinkedIn?&quot; The point of the question is to A) identify candidates who are motivated to grow their talents, and B) communicate to the candidate that it&#x27;s OK to imagine quitting someday.<p>That&#x27;s an example of what LinkedIn believes works, but it might not be appropriate for another company, say that wants to hire programmers into more of a stable career pipeline. Similarly, some shops might be highly specialized in certain roles/technologies, making deep-dive technical interviews more valuable than at a company that needs bright generalists to solve poorly defined problems. There can be no one-size-fits-all solution.<p>One thing that&#x27;s worked well for me is to have candidates meet a significant number of the peers they will be working with. Another is to ask a quick &quot;weeder&quot; tech question and then an open-ended architecture design question (i.e. Describe how you would build the Facebook activity feed). Checking references is also valuable. But these are just ideas and they may not make sense (or be possible) in every situation.",1433988726

You may disagree with these claims, but do they qualify as &quot;hate speech&quot;?<p>In other words:<p>> <i>contributes to hateful actions, contributes to subconscious prejudice, etc</i><p>How <i>much</i> does the speech have to contribute to these, before it&#x27;s declared out of bounds?

Is <i>any</i> amount intolerable (ignoring for a moment that &quot;contributes to subconscious prejudice&quot; seems to apply to literally any statement with a truth value at all)?

I am for diversity and would personally hire diverse if I had the chance to, but if a woman decides to hire 5 other women to start her small business, even though 5 better male candidates exists, I am fine with that. There is no right to get a job at a particular company.

In this case I would value the right of the woman to choose who she wants to pay for work higher than the rights of the men.<p>What you should not be able to do is hire 100 female workers instead of 100 better male workers, because that way you would substantially violate their right to get treated equally and lower their chances to get a job.<p>I know, that this view conflicts with protecting minorities in some cases.

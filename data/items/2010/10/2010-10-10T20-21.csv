But the crux of his argument seems to be that you <i>have</i> to have these external motivators, otherwise you'll never be any good at what you are learning.<p>I suppose the argument could be made that if you don't have external pressures, you won't learn whatever you are studying well <i>enough</i>. This argument seems specious to me. I've heard plenty of stories which validates against my own more limited experience with people who are motivated to learning by extrinsic motivations; on the level, they just aren't as good, because the extrinsic motivation ends the instant you can convince someone else you are good enough. From there, you only have to convince yourself you are good enough, and the thresholds for this vary a lot. Having the intrinsic motivation to go beyond what others expect I could only see having an additive effect on one's ability.<p>Or perhaps I am just making an attempt to validate my own intrinsic motivation to learn stuff in spite of a relative absence of external pressure. I can't help but think this author is attempting to validate the converse of that.<p>Or maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe if I want a position at a bank being held to this sort of standard, then I don't really have to worry about teaching myself new things and I can survive without a motivation above and beyond getting paid. I don't know that I'd be so sycophantic toward that culture, though, if that is all that is expected of me. I certainly wouldn't go so far as to write an article claiming it is a waste of my time.<p>One other point:<p><i>First of all, banks are always a good indicator of the position’s value in business terms.</i><p>How true is this? He seems to take the stance that banks are pretty much infallible when it comes to assigning proper value to individuals; the folklore I am exposed to here and elsewhere suggests this isn't anywhere near true.<p>It seems rather odd, also, that he asserts that banks will fire people who have even short-term decreases in added value. This seems really foolish; value generation varies over time. I don't understand how organizations with such a intricate grasp of value production could miss this. That is, unless they don't have that grasp he claims they do.",1286741955

A huge proportion of people with net worths in the low single digits of millions have almost all their money in their retirement plan plus house, and not a particularly large disposable income. Sure, in theory they could get money out of the 401(k) and blow it, but the fact that it's semi-locked-up and a hassle to get out makes it easier to preserve it.<p>It's possible it generalizes to higher tiers of the rich, but I'm not that sure. Do people with net worths of $10m+ have similarly frugal lifestyles? Or is this mainly a feature of people with net worths in the $1m-3m range?",1286741053

1777807,comment,1776929,1777507,0,0,danudey,,,"As a sysadmin for about ten years, this argument makes no sense to me.<p>Zed has created a new, flexible configuration method using sqlite, which lets me easily automate changes to the web server configuration. If version control is an issue, I can easily automate taking a human-readable, source-controllable dump of the database however often is reasonable.<p>Bernstein, on the other hand, decided that everything about the UNIX system was wrong, and built his system around what he asserted was a better way. All of qmail went into /var/qmail, which meant you had to either symlink everything in place anyway or add it to your $PATH, which caused unnecessary confusion.<p>He encouraged a different (non-human-readable) timestamp for log files (<a href=""http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html</a>), making it a huge hassle to take a quick glance through your log files for something without piping it through at least one extra process.<p>While we're talking about config files, he also used one config file for every variable (allowed hosts, virtual domains, etc), meaning that checking to make sure you configured something right involved cat'ing all kinds of files back and forth and scrolling up and down in your terminal.<p>He designed the qmail build process to hard-code the user IDs into the binaries, meaning you couldn't move a compiled version of qmail from one server to another unless all their UIDs/GIDs were identical. He also made qmail use inode numbers as file names for messages in the mail queue, meaning you couldn't move a queue from one server to another without renumbering each file.<p>Finally, he prevented people from shipping modified copies of his source code, meaning that adding any new features to qmail required patches, with a very significant chance that two patches for different features would interact in unexpected or inconsistent ways. It also meant that if you didn't have the original source tree and wanted to add one single feature (or even change the UIDs qmail ran under) there was a significant chance that you would lose features and/or your config would break.<p>Presumably this last rule was put in place to prevent people from fixing all the brain damage that went into qmail's ridiculous design. It caused nothing but massive headaches, and linux distributions had to jump through hoops to provide qmail as a package, since one single change to the source required the installer to download, compile, and install it for you.<p>qmail was a system administrator's nightmare because DJB had in his head what he believed to be a much better way to manage software on a UNIX system, and he went out of his way to make his software use that and force people to deal with it if he wanted to use that software (making qmail open source for most of its lifetime). The problem is that that might well have been a great system, if everything was using it, but since no one but him used his wildly varied system it just made qmail a headache. For as long as sendmail was the only alternative, it was a headache worth dealing with, but once Postfix came along most (open-minded) sysadmins jumped ship at the first opportunity.<p>Qmail is horrid, non-free software, but, like Windows, it was horrid, non-free software we all had to deal with for a long time. Now there are other, better options.<p>So I'll reiterate: qmail was a horrible mess that made my life, as a system administrator, a huge hassle. Mongrel2 and its DB config file, on the other hand, are ideas I'm ridiculously excited about, and can't wait to put into production, because the flexibility and power available in this sort of config philosophy are things I can do a great deal with.<p>Don't compare Zed to DJB. DJB looked down his nose at anyone who didn't like his pure, pristine system, and if you didn't like it, too bad for you. Zed, on the other hand, has gone out of his way to make his software work with whatever workflows we, as sysadmins, need to implement. That's worth some high praise, as far as I'm concerned.",1286740963

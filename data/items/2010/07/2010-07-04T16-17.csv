1485932,comment,1485640,1485788,0,0,sounddust,,,"The point I'm making is that it's not as easy of a problem to resolve as you are claiming.  The problem is that - as you said - there are so many different XSS vectors in the browser; if you patch one specific use case then the exploiter will just find another.   Browser developers aren't avoiding this problem; they just realize how complicated it is and have to approach it slowly to do it right, and to not break compatibility.<p>Your <noscript_within> tag is something that I'm sure every browser developer (and web app developer) has thought up at some point. It does not resolve this problem. It would only protect a site in the case that a website allowed <i>all</i> user input to be passed directly onto the page unedited.   Your solution would require app developers to allow commenters the full range of HTML (including blink, marquee, and who knows what else) in their comments.  Because once the app developer starts to try to filter the commenter's input, he's opening himself up to an exploit that allows the filtered output to contain a </noscript_within> tag.<p>The simplest example would be an app developer who simply deleted all <marquee> tags because he/she wanted to disallow marquees.  The script kiddie would just insert </noscript_<marquee>within> into his comment.<p>The more complicated examples would be things that neither you nor I have thought of yet.<p>That doesn't even take into account the exploit of users in legacy web apps who could potentially start passing in unclosed <noscript_within> tags (in apps which allow HTML but filter only certain tags) to disable legitimate JS later in the page, breaking the apps.  Of course, it would be possible to only enable <noscript_within> based on doctype or something else, but then it's certain that some web developers will accidentally forget to do so and leave their app open to abuse.<p>You are oversimplifying the problem.  I am sure that a solution exists and XSS will eventually become a problem of the past, but the solution will be more complicated than you claim it would be.",1278262509
1485931,comment,1485584,1485584,0,0,learner4life,,,"One of the reasons outsourcing happens is not to get cheap labor.  Individual developer cost do seem cheap, but adding the culture cost (like India, where low productivity is generously tolerated and bad people are kept around)  and the communication cost(time lag, people not understanding the requirement, distance from the customer)  brings the total cost of the team to be nearly at par with the cost of the American team.<p>It is not that the management at the large companies cannot see it.  They do it prevent wage inflation in America.  If they can get comparable work( and you can get it from India if you manage it right) at nearly the same cost, they reduce the demand for similar jobs in America.<p>As to the specific answer , yes it does work.  However, you need a strong management that focuses on results.   I have seen projects outsourced with no clear goals handed to the offshore team.  They invariably fail (despite the team being reasonably smart) because the team was not working towards anything tangible.",1278262491

1485929,comment,1483775,1483852,0,0,bradleyland,,,"The problem with questions like this is that you need knowledge from a variety of areas in order to offer a well informed answer. I mean, how much can a BP oil engineer know about exploding a nuclear bomb underground? I'd imagine that there are only a handful of scientists around the globe who have worked directly with exploding nuclear devices, and even fewer who have studied the effects such explosions on underwater geology. There are entire fields of study dedicated to the effects of explosions on geology, but they deal with relatively small explosions, and the results simply don't scale to things like 30 kiloton nuclear detonations.<p>For me, this is what makes the answer a ""no"". We simply do not know what the results will be. There aren't enough trustworthy experts. As much as relations have improved with Russia, I don't think we can trust their advice in this situation. From a policy perspective, they have a history of putting results before safety.",1278262473

She said the feeling of water entering her ears freaked her. I told her to treat it as a phobia, since she had such a strong aversion.<p>Water entering the ear can cause temporary disequilibrium.

1485886,comment,1485519,1485519,0,0,giardini,,,"Blog Spam<p>Summary: after practicing swimming with various techniques for months, he bought a book titled ""Total Immersion"" and was saved. Not exactly what the title states.<p>Despite claiming that he's tried to learn to swim for years this is the sole blog post on swimming. But the blog _does_ have ads for ""endless pool"" swimming machines.<p>The hand-written notes, difficult to read for a non-swimmer, are a perfect lead-in to get a browser to buy the book. He could have typed in those notes, but that they're hand-written may give them more credence. In browsing the notes questions arise: what is a ""Russian"", how do I do ""sensory drills"" and how do they differ from ""skill drills""? Guess I'll have to buy a book, a DVD or pay for a special course to find out.<p>This is good blog spam for Total Immersion, which has been around for years. Maybe it will sell some books for them. I wonder how much they paid for it.<p>As Astro Zombie stated on Metafilter:

There is a correlation between calorie surplus and weight gain, but saying the first caused the second is like saying (to use an example from the book) that alcoholism is caused by drinking too much — tautological, and not useful in fixing the condition.<p>Taubes goes on to argue that because of an underlying metabolic condition (induced by a carb-heavy diet, as it turns out), your body decides to gain weight and so makes you eat more calories than you burn.  So it's not that you gain weight because you eat too much, it's that you eat too much because you're gaining weight.<p>Edit: sorry to rsheridan6 for using the ""true, and not useful"" turn of phrase without having realized someone else beat me to it.

The other is writing awkward and difficult code that needs care and attention.  I can listen to music while writing the first kind, but I cannot listen to any kind of music while writing the second.<p>It makes me wonder, what if I didn't listen to music while writing the ""no-think"" code?  What if I paid attention, thought about it carefully, and put my brain to work instead of just banging out the code.  Would I have insights that I might otherwise miss?<p>And I'm reminded of the study at Cornell[1], quoted in PeopleWare (DeMarco and Lister) where the effects of music were studied.  That study found that listening to music can (apparently) inhibit or prevent insights, somehow preventing the ""Aha!"" that can sometimes make all the difference.<p>Of course, using music to isolate yourself from noisy surrounds is one thing, but earplugs and white noise might actually work better. People are different, but it's cause for pause.  Maybe you think you can code just as well, perhaps better, with music.  But perhaps you're like the people in the study - thinking you code just as well, but actually missing some insights.<p>[1] Despite looking, I've been unable to find the original study, and so, it seems, have others.

Let me explain…<p>Essentially what I do is spec out the project very specifically and have local people write the front end.  Then we outsource the backend and have interns use the locally built frontend to thoroughly test the backend delivered from the outsourced company.<p>This isn’t dramatically cheaper since you have to spec the thing locally and pay interns to test it while still paying the outsourced developers (it only saves about $2.65 an hour by my calculations).  But it does have advantages in that it allows us to be more flexible with our schedule (we can employ more or less outsourced workers as needed) and it does make for a happier development environment (allowing local developers to focus on the relatively more fun front end development and less on the nuts and bolts backend stuff)<p>So in the end I feel it’s successful though again not so much in the financial sense.",1278260527

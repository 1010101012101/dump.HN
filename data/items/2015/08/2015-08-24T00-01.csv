NoteWorthy Composer was first released in 1994; last I looked was around 2011. It looks like that year, after I stopped looking because I was no longer singing with the group using binary .nwc files, MIT&#x27;s Music21 project started scraping together beginnings of a parser. (Also, sometime around 2007, the software authors voluntarily added a text export format. That doesn&#x27;t count, because it depends on the goodwill of the software authors, just like the web services being decried.)<p>If it took <i>fifteen years</i> for someone to decipher the format, and it only started being slightly parseable in the modern web API era where we&#x27;ve supposedly left scripting behind, I don&#x27;t think you can claim either that it &quot;isn&#x27;t going to be too hard to decipher,&quot; nor that we&#x27;re losing anything in our modern era.<p>(Also, like, my memory of software in the &#x27;90s is that in several cases the authors went out of their way to add obfuscation or anti-tampering features to their data formats.)<p>> How is this any different, other than scale, than the &quot;web APIs&quot; you claim solve the author&#x27;s complaints?<p>I didn&#x27;t claim that they solve the author&#x27;s complaints. I claimed that it makes no difference whether the software is web-based or local.<p>Your Mac vs. PC distinction is much the same. Some web services are pretty good at this; some aren&#x27;t. If this is a criticism of the PC platform, phrase it as a criticism of the PC platform, not the web.<p>> No, they don&#x27;t. They require <i>writing code</i>, which requires that you actually be able to, you know, <i>program</i>.<p>1. <a href=""https://zapier.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://zapier.com/</a><p>2.

Being a waiter, myself for 24 years including 3 star Michelin (NYC), was a practical, enjoyable professional job in which I dealt with the public. Guests were almost always friendly people looking to have an enjoyable time. This type of writing is bombastic and provocative but lacks any true substance. Every industry deals with the cult of personality. I&#x27;m sorry to say it but there&#x27;s nothing to see here. It&#x27;s just not that big a deal.</i> - Chad Murdock<p>I have to agree...there are a couple of anecdotes of &quot;inflammatory 1% behavior&quot; and the overall style of the writing was nice, it just seems like the author is making a big deal out of basically nothing so that the NYTimes can stoke the anti-1% flames and generate more views.",1440377873

10107368,comment,10107009,10107335,0,0,beloch,,,"In high-school I worked in a restaurant.  Not high-end, but decent enough that some customers expected a lot.  Most customers were respectable human beings, but there were a few sad and pathetic misanthropes who acted as though paying money gave them absolute power over you.  Those customers were enough to make the job feel a bit like prostitution.  At a high end restaurant I&#x27;d imagine this effect is intensified, both by the amount of dollars changing hands and the discipline of the staff.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that it would never work in today&#x27;s world, but the ancient Roman holiday of  Saturnalia is something direly needed today.  If the ultra-rich spent one day a year in service to wage-slaves who normally serve them, it might make the rest of the year feel a little less empty for people like the author of this article.",1440377756

So obviously the Soviet system, which under the rule of Stalin killed millions of people (as in close to 50 million) during that same time is much better. Yes a job for everyone, even if that job is digging up ice dirt in the Siberian Gulag until you die from exhaustion. Come on, have some perspective, both systems are totalitarian regimes with horrible outcomes for the populations. In your case they were killing, torturing, and exterminating the left leaning intelligentsia. In the Soviet Union they did exactly the same thing to all the right leaning intelligentsia, actually all intelligentsia, because smart and educated people might see through all the bull shit the party was shoveling down people&#x27;s throats. At the end of the day, in both cases a ton of people died horrible deaths simply because of what they believed in. How is one system better then the other? Well, other then in absolute terms, because at least in your case they didn&#x27;t manage to killing quite so many people, but the outcome is the same. I am amazed that someone who lived through one totalitarian regime would be so in favor of another! Any system that subverts the rights of an individual under some bullshit pretense that it&#x27;s for the &quot;good of the nation&quot; is absolutely wrong!",1440377563

If your argument is &quot;twitter can&#x27;t delete these due to it violating US law&quot; that is an argument about twitter, and not it&#x27;s TOS.<p>If your argument is &quot;people don&#x27;t have to follow the TOS because the TOS requires them to not comply with the law&quot;, that is simply wrong.
If the TOS asks you to do something illegal in your country, it does not make the TOS illegal per-se.  It means <i>you can&#x27;t use the service</i>, because <i>you can&#x27;t comply with the TOS</i>.
There generally is no &quot;well, i can do whatever i want and it&#x27;s twitter&#x27;s problem because i can&#x27;t comply with the TOS&quot;.

10107346,comment,10105071,10107144,0,0,yalue,,,"You may be interested to know that there has recently been a notable movement in systems security research to push for an &quot;execute-only&quot; permission, that makes executable data unreadable in addition to unwriteable. This has come in response to certain attacks (i.e. <a href=""http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a574.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a574.pdf</a>) that use scripting languages (such as JS or Flash&#x27;s actionscript) to read all of memory at exploit time and use this knowledge to craft a payload that bypasses ASLR.<p>So, works such as <a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sjcrane/papers/sjcrane15_readactor.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sjcrane/papers/sjcrane15_readactor.p...</a> (and several others) are attempting to come up with systems that can prevent this type of attack by preventing executable memory from being read in the first place. This is made difficult not only by the fact that even if processors could support such permissions (many generally can&#x27;t in any efficient fashion), but also due to the fact that many compilers frequently mix together executable code and static data, such as strings. The second paper I linked is about instrumenting LLVM to ensure that it always outputs readable data and code in separate sections.<p>Having been involved in such research myself, I can confidently respond to the parent&#x27;s question too by saying that, if anything, a majority of modern compilers freely mix code and data. In addition, there is often data that is directly related to code, such as tables of addresses used in a switch statement, but is never intended to be directly executed. Even if it would work just fine to place such tables in a read-only section, it may make logical sense to the compiler authors to place it in the vicinity of where it is used (that is, in the executable data section).",1440376838

A constriction on UI is similar to a schema constriction.

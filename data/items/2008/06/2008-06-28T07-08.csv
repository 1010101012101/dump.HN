The Lyre bird can perfectly mimick lots of man-made sounds: camera shutter, camera with a motor drive, car alarm, chainsaw. <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=VjE0Kdfos4Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=VjE0Kdfos4Y</a>",1214639677

Like the other day I thought I'd write a quick piece of software in java to automatically navigate from one spot to another and avoid obstructions. Sounded like a 15 minute job, lasted 3 days. It's the same problem all AI creators have, but with them, it sounds like 15 minutes, lasts 3 years and still doesn't work.",1214637169

Does anyone actually think ""the possibilities are endless,"" that this device ""is a prankster's dream"" and ""could destroy photography""? I am skeptical of the physics described but since I'm not a digicam expert I will just have to trust von Bismarck solved an apparent latency problem. (When my digicam flashes, the fulgerator has to receive that input and respond with its own flash, all before my shutter closes.) Ambient and direct lighting would both have to be below normal daytime levels and the subject needs to be dark enough to contrast the fulgerator's light. I wish this guy all the luck due a man caught adulterating vacation photos but I don't see how he has developed a viable tool. Maybe if I followed his Ã¼ber optics hack, I'd understand the secret implications of his toy.",1214637158

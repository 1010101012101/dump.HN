Getting a college degree is likely the best path to financial success for most people, but definitely isn&#x27;t for all.<p>For some, the opportunity cost of investing time/money into an education prevents them from learning more through some alternate means (i.e. starting your own company, apprenticeship with key individuals, etc.), and may lead to more economic success.

/want/ their employees to have kids means that they desire it to some degree.  I am sure MS doesn&#x27;t desire it, but rather indifferent.  But they do desire to be a more humanitarian company and want their employees to be happier.<p>> Why shouldn&#x27;t we also keep people without kids happy?  Everyone deserves time to pursue passions outside of work. Some people are passionate about their families.
Are you trying to say that because people with children have parental leave, people without children should have equivalent leaves too?  That sounds a little ridiculous to me.",1438815411

After seeing what happened in Greece and getting a better understanding of just what our financial situation is as a country I would like to start putting some money away into an offshore account, possibly in a country that might be a retirement location. I am not looking to evade the IRS or hide money away, I just want to remove my current single point of failure if you will :)
In researching this topic it seems as if this has become quite difficult in recent years due to some regulations put in place making it less than beneficial for other countries to open up accounts for US citizens.<p>So my question is: if you are a US Citizen with an offshore account, have you had any issues with it? If so, has it been worth the trouble? Was it a hassle to setup (using a 3rd party, large initial deposit, etc)? Any alternatives outside of &quot;hard goods&quot; like silver or gold?<p>It seems most sites out on the web that discuss this topic want to sell you an e-book or a website subscription so any real-world experience would be great.

There was much less of a norm of being in the office past 6 or reachable in evenings/weekends, and much more of a norm of getting in at 10 (probably right after dropping off the kids for work). There was no desire to have work-provided dinner, because my coworkers wanted dinner with their families. There is probably also a less-tangible change, that people with families don&#x27;t define their self-worth by their work quite as much. This trickled down into when meetings were scheduled, what expectations there were for last-minute work ahead of deadlines, whether the company did supposedly-informal events on evenings and weekends, etc., and as a result, it meant that <i>my</i> work-life balance was good.<p>I&#x27;m now skeptical of workplaces where everyone else is like me, with no family that wants them home by dinner. I don&#x27;t actually think these policies will successfully incentivize anyone to start or not start families, but even if you wanted to be that cynical, there&#x27;s a clear advantage in work-life balance for everyone to encourage a sizable fraction of your employees to have families.

The MVP works this way, for example (and has been used in a few hospitals).<p>In that case, yeah, hospitals will tend to differ very significantly; once you go beyond the HL7 world, any hope of a standardized interface goes out the window.  Expect hospitals to run their own copies of your database in that case, and expect them to be very strict about what access you get.<p>> Does this mean you&#x27;ve seen off-site hosted apps using these HIPAA PAAS providers being used by hospitals &quot;in production&quot; (so to speak)?<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see a HIPAA-complaint PaaS vendor in use by an actual hospital, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning that at least one such vendor - Catalyze - claims Blue Shield and the VA hospitals as customers.<p>I <i>have</i>, however, seen off-site EMRs in use by hospitals, particularly (as I mentioned previously) CPSI (though the hospital I worked for - which was, at the time, apparently CPSI&#x27;s largest customer - eventually strongarmed them into providing support for an onsite server).  Such EMRs are typically hosted on hardware owned and operated by the vendor.<p>Most hospital <i>districts</i>, multi-facility providers, etc. will opt for a single installation of an EMR throughout all their locations.  Usually this will be facilitated using a provider-wide VPN, so that&#x27;ll probably help your particular usecase somewhat.  In most cases, this is as close as you&#x27;re going to get to &quot;off-site&quot; once you get to larger providers, though - again - deviations from this are not entirely unheard of.<p>> Is this regardless of using a HIPAA-compliant PAAS, or only in the case where we don&#x27;t? I&#x27;m already dreading the answer ;)<p>HIPAA-compliant PaaS products are pretty new, so this answer will undoubtedly change over time, but <i>currently</i>, such a PaaS will only flatten that expontential curve to <i>maybe</i> a linear one.  Small hospitals and clinics will certainly be interested, since many of them dread having to manage any sort of IT infrastructure, to the point of even contracting out to their <i>competitors</i> in some cases (as I witnessed firsthand) instead of trying to do anything themselves.  Once they&#x27;ve gone forward with their own IT department, however, the chances of even a HIPAA-compliant PaaS being deemed suitable starts to dwindle, and emphasis on self-hosted solutions grows stronger and stronger.",1438813960

Maybe companies should offer sabbaticals to everyone, and if some people choose to use that to take time off after having kids, then that&#x27;s fine.

eg. glide ratio of a 777 (~18:1), or how the 777 Fly-by-wire control system works under certain failure modes. There hasn&#x27;t been a crew incapacitation crash in a fly-by-wire airliner before.<p>A small fire in the electrical bay could disable aircraft systems in unexpected ways, and possibly even burn out on its own, and the damage doesn&#x27;t actually cause the jet to crash immediately. If the cockpit crew were incapacitated at cruise altitude, the jet could still end up 100 miles away from the point the engines flamed out.",1438812439

You essentially /only/ had the unprecendented communications wizardry when you tied yourself to one of several oversized devices in universities or big companies. But now, every person has a platform for communication in their pockets and embedded into most other devices.<p>So right now, we don&#x27;t have a ubiquitous platform for permissionless agreements that can operate outside government and corporation. The most tech-savvy among us are experimenting, but the real exciting possibilities come when people start building tools for managing agreements without requiring privileged third-parties specializing in the management of that trust transaction. Then, lots of businesses start being decoupled -- the bread and butter of most businesses are just the bundling a few specific trusted transaction types in accordance with legal requirements.<p>ie Uber = reputation + geospatial routing +  messaging/agreements between drivers and passengers. Having an agreement platform allows the monopoly of coordination for these types of trust transactions to be wrested away from organizations like Uber. The same goes for lots of other types of organizations :)",1438812336

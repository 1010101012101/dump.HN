Academia is hard to break into, and from what I gather from talking to a lot of math professors, it seems to have been this way since the 50&#x27;s.<p>No on industry.  I&#x27;m on other math forums, and judging by the constant reposts of &quot;Finding a job with a math degree&quot;, I really believe that it&#x27;s tough finding a job in private industry as well.<p>Personally, I decided not to do a pure maths degree but instead concentrate on statistics.  The job prospects in industry are much better in that field.  And, my goal was to teach at community colleges.  From my discussion with CC faculty, their most popular math courses are statistics.  So, they often look for people who have strong stats backgrounds.  My plan is to find work as a statistician and work as an adjunct until I can land a permanent TT job at the community colleges.  I just got certified as a SAS programmer, and there are lots of jobs at there I can do remotely.",1406498367

8094112,comment,8093753,8094093,3,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"I agree with you (that it could be an important tool).<p>However I will say that the VB6->VB.Net transpiler which Microsoft produced (and clearly spent significant amounts of effort on) was pretty terrible. And that is one of the most &quot;complete&quot; transpilers I know of...<p>The problem is that for a transpiler to produce &quot;good&quot; output code it needs to have a deep understanding of both context but also intent. This is particularly important when converting from one language to another with slightly different underlying concepts (like VB5-6 Vs. VB.Net). Without that understanding it just produces spaghetti code, that will technically compile (*although often it didn&#x27;t in the VB6->VB.net example) but is unmaintable.<p>I liken it to Microsoft Word&#x27;s HTML engine. Word can produce websites, and those websites technically looked correct in most browsers, but they became an unmaintainable mess in the medium to long term. A lot of transpilers have the same issue.<p>The best thing I can say about transpilers is that they&#x27;re very good for a starting point (assume 100% refactoring anyway) and converting simplistic data storage vehicles (e.g. classes with tons of constants).",1406498274

People tend to the cheap side when it comes to paying for apps. The result is that each marginal increment of &quot;value&quot; in an app comes with a geometric increase in cost to produce it. It&#x27;s also a feedback loop: people aren&#x27;t willing to pay (very much) even for good apps because there are a sufficient number of developers doing it &quot;just good enough&quot; and giving it away for free, and so developers who could make an even better app shy away from doing so since the prospective benefit doesn&#x27;t merit the risk.",1406498217

I know you have to prepare for the worst case scenario, and that&#x27;s how it must be planed, but still seems that our imagination runs wild.<p>Some comments talk about it, but I think the reason is missing. ANY kind of sign, text, symbol, phenomenon, structure, will only draw attention. No matter how dangerous it seems, people will be attracted to the mystery. The more dangerous it seems the more they&#x27;ll get attracted to it. It´s about attention and the lack of it.<p>The best option is to make it seem like nothing it&#x27;s there, no buildings, no signs, anything. Just bury it deep, restore the natural environment, create a natural park (restricted if you want while the memory stands) and if possible remove all economic incentives close to the park, so the population is reduced overtime, ideally till 0.<p>Another option I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned could be to bury it in a geological subduction zone (at considerable deeps of course), so over time all the radiation gets dragged deep inside the earth by the tectonic movement. This would cover the 200000 years problem I guess. I don&#x27;t know if there is such a zone that could be useful or safe enough for this, or if the geological tempo is fast enough to be of any use.<p>Edit: Iphone typos, and some editing for clarity.",1406497564

8094085,comment,8092938,8093914,3,0,onetimeusename,,,"I think what surprises me is the discrepancy between reading about mathematicians who worked with younger students out of seemingly altruistic motives (Kolmogorov and Erdos come to mind) and then a contemporary math department that might only accept 1% of applicants out of a pool of qualified people because of perhaps funding concerns or some interest in maintaining exclusivity. On top of that, there is a long history of mathematicians who worked on problems without any monetary compensation and perhaps without being associated with any university. Decartes and Fermat were both lawyers and even recently Yitang Zhang didn&#x27;t seem to be paid to do research, and I don&#x27;t count adjunct lecturer as a paid research job.<p>Given these, I don&#x27;t see why an organization can&#x27;t get together and simply agree to communicate, work together, somehow find a way to minimally provide access to journals for its members and dutifully train new students and grant them degrees.

The act of legislating is trading between competing interests; various people are attempting to use startups as a whole to get self-serving visa changes with zero to negative benefits to the majority of the members of the startup community: non-founders.<p>On to you: your situation is the exception to the common use of h1bs.  You&#x27;re probably a giant minority.  The common use as far as I know of h1bs is to hold down wages of engineering.  Microsoft and yahoo laying off engineers while simultaneously applying for h1b visas trivially demonstrates the lie in the &quot;engineer shortage&quot; nonsense.<p>Employee friendly changes to h1b visas could include many things: removing the tie between the sponsoring company and the employee (so if he or she is underpaid he or she can easily switch jobs); or aggressive investigation of prevailing wage requirements (oops there goes Infosys&#x27; business model); or 5+ year bans on h1b applications post layoffs.  But bluntly, I think we have more than enough visas already.  I&#x27;d change my mind if I saw engineering wages rise, concerted action on the part of ceos to help control housing costs, and concerted action on the part of ceos to help fix US education and increase the domestic engineering pipeline; or concerted action on the part of ceos to police visa fraud (see infosys, or epic systems, etc).",1406495540

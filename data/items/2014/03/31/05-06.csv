It&#x27;s not like these are cheap investments that HFT firms are making.  If they&#x27;re truly pointless, we should expect them to lead to overcapacity and ultimately the exit of some players (unless, of course, the arms race is being unnaturally subsidized in some way, e.g. by the lack of a sub-penny rule).<p>When Paul Reuter was using carrier pigeons and telegraphs to move tradeable information between stock exchanges ahead of his competitors, I wonder if people considered this an arms race of negligible social value.

The reason why I said &quot;probably&quot; because I can&#x27;t speak for every NoSQL database out there.<p>We had a 5 node cluster in Mongo that we moved to Cassandra last summer. While our experience with Cassandra is by and large much more performant and cost effective than MongoDB, getting setup with Cassandra was not as easy with MongoDB. With MongoDB you can literally start throwing data in your database, then add an index after the fact. With Cassandra we had to make sure our data was modeled correctly, and decide where we would denormalize. Riak from what I remember has a similar data model to Cassandra, and Redis isn&#x27;t something you just &quot;start up and go&quot; (mainly because its an in memory store).<p>So I know for a fact that Cassandra, Riak, Dynamo, and Redis are far more complex than MongoDB. Cassandra even requires you run a &quot;repair&quot; command periodically, and that alone makes it more ops work than Cassandra. We can even throw HBase in there too as it requires Zookeeper nodes, Named Nodes, and all that Hadoop goodness.<p>Now none of these databases are hard to use, but compared to mongo, mongo is a cakewalk. You literally spin it up, throw json inside, and get json back. There is no query writing, and for most cases there is very little ops management. In most cases if a query is slow, you can fix that by adding an index, or moving to SSDs, only once you have exhausted these options do you really have to consider anything else.<p>FullContact also has a similar story : <a href=""http://www.fullcontact.com/blog/mongo-to-cassandra-migration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fullcontact.com/blog/mongo-to-cassandra-migration...</a>\ntl;dr Mongo was great for getting the product up and iterating quickly, but then they moved once they thought they needed too. Its my opinion that its far easier to get started with MongoDB that it is to get started with Postgres/MySQL.<p>Lastly, damn the technical reasons why its so popular, Mongo/10Gen used be a huge marketing engine around ~1.6/8. They captured a lot of developer mindshare and I&#x27;d attribute that to why its so popular now as well. Wasn&#x27;t much longer after that when they naysayers & those hurt by the initial hype came out of the woodwork and we got the now infamous &quot;MongoDB is webscale&quot; video.",1396243551

Imperfect presence.  You interact with a virtual world through a window.  You frequently walk around in that world as a humanoid avatar speaking to other humanoids and you completely forget you&#x27;re looking through a window into their world. Imperfect presence works.  It even worked back when you could see pixels the size of your avatar&#x27;s head. VR simply puts your head through the window and lets you look around.  Why didn&#x27;t it take off sooner then?  Up until now, 2D windows had clearly superior lag properties and limited resolution meant things looked better on smaller displays.  It&#x27;s also pretty wasteful to blow pixels on peripheral vision, so we didn&#x27;t bother when pixels were expensive. VR headsets don&#x27;t have to be perfect to take off.

I mean I tried for the past 5 years, on and off, but I&#x27;ve been doing the same god damn problem everytime and it&#x27;s recently that I realized that I don&#x27;t know shit about business and marketing. I focused some time on that by researching and doing brainstorming.<p>I&#x27;m not ready to give up but it&#x27;s just staggering how long it has taken me and each year, it has been a mediocre, mostly due to me burning out when it came time to do the business stuff because I spent all my energy on building the damn product and than kept on adding new features so that it would entice customers from the sheer list of features.<p>Take the $5000, save it. Do not spend it on a new startup idea. I&#x27;ve spent about $50 in total for my 12th attempt. I spent about $3000 on my 5th attempt in 2010. Didn&#x27;t do jack shit.

They are both these amazing walled ecosystems that develop completely independent forms of life (digital or otherwise.)<p>What confuses me is that the Chinese do this in plain sight and yet the American startup ecosystem doesn&#x27;t seem to give them much mention. I hardly even seen TechCrunch or Pando talking about Chinese startups, while at the same time they are willing to talk about London, Berlin and Tel Aviv startups. I&#x27;ve always wondered if this was because of some latent racism, or because of the foreigness of the Chinese characters.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s interesting to think that parts of the forefront of innovation isn&#x27;t being reported (this story aside), and that there&#x27;s a whole world of technology culture that&#x27;s developing independently in China in part because of the totalitarian political regime.<p>I, for one, think that digital currencies are going to explode in China - the Chinese love to gamble on things like this, and the Yuan is a joke. I believe that it might just be the most opaque currency in the world. (But I don&#x27;t know much about all the other ones that are in the running.

7499760,comment,7499313,7499313,4,0,jamieabe,,,"The bigger story of HFT is that it enables the big banks to manipulate the stock market. Because they know all market orders before they are executed, they are able to cancel all bids and offers before it is possible for anyone to hit or take them. They can also put up huge orders on the bid or offer to make a stock look weak or strong in the short run, knowing there is no risk of being executed.  If they see another order come in they can just cancel their order.\nThe most criminal advantage HFT gives them is that they can front run orders.  Let&#x27;s say for example that Fidelity calls Goldman Sachs and says they want to buy 1 million shares of Tesla.  This information is priceless as Tesla stock is guaranteed to fly higher on this trade.  Acting on this information is the most blatant form of insider trading that exists.  However, somehow the big banks can create programs that do exactly this.  Whenever they see a huge influx of buy or sell volume they can quickly jump in front and close out the transaction a few seconds later for a huge profit.",1396242636

Sometime people get overwhelmed by an idea, and this idea has its inception from what other people are doing. This makes you look what you are doing is not good. Business, Job, Status, Money etc. it’s all work and just a small part of life (Life has many more aspect). If something does not work for you, then let it go. Start new, which bring backs balance to your life. By starting new I mean not only work, if your work does not bring money then switch (there is no shame); if your current job gives you a lot money but now time to spend with your loved you are still doing a stupid thing; if your individualist character don&#x27;t let you pursue grouping (family/relation), bring a change in you (how much you devote to life that relation)... It’s all about balance. When you are standing at such a point in life, people can just give you advice; it’s just YOU who can help YOURSELF. No work is big or small, real status is being a good person…..etc.…<p>So my friend, let it go, start with something which will --> work for you <-- and which will get you what ever really matter for you (your Girlfriend, time, family).

You know what&#x27;s worse than working a job you hate? Not having any money at all.<p>Secondly, stop trying to start the process with an idea. The best way to come up with a solid business idea is to pick a market (preferably one you know something about) and learn as much as you can about it. Observe what people are saying. Write down what people are complaining about. Get to know them inside and out. Once you&#x27;ve done the market research, THEN brainstorm ideas based on that research. Start small. Build a landing page with an email submit and shop the link around to your market. If they bite (which they should if you did your research properly), then work on building out the product.<p>All that work should cost you nothing more than time and hosting/design. Save that $5000 for when you&#x27;ll really need it—after your product has been validated and you have interest/pre-orders.<p>Good luck!!",1396242383

Our argument has four parts. First, we use millisecond-level direct-feed data from exchanges to show that the continuous limit order book market design does not really “work” in continuous time: market correlations completely break down at high-frequency time horizons. Second, we show that this correlation breakdown creates frequent technical arbitrage opportunities, available to whomever is fastest, which in turn creates an arms race to exploit such opportunities. Third, we develop a simple new theory model motivated by these empirical facts. The model shows that the arms race is not only socially wasteful – a prisoner’s dilemma built directly into the market design – but moreover that its cost is ultimately borne by investors via wider spreads and thinner markets. Last, we show that frequent batch auctions eliminate the arms race, both because they reduce the value of tiny speed advantages and because they transform competition on speed into competition on price. Consequently, frequent batch auctions lead to narrower spreads, deeper markets, and increased social welfare.</i>",1396242353

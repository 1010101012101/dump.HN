People are horrible to surviving spouses during a very trying time.  From the burial site trying to rip her off, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m sorry that grave site you pre-paid for is no longer available, here is a similar one for an extra $800&quot; to Visa suddenly cancelling all their joint credit cards and leaving her with no $$ when she called them and tried to put the cards in just her name.  They immediately cancelled all the cards and told her she would have to reapply!  And they had like 80k of coverage, zero balance and excellent credit.  She was having to pay for all the funeral expenses up front which were around 12k.<p>The whole process was horrible. She was a wreck and would just say &quot;yes&quot; to whatever.  I ended up taking 3 weeks off work, flying out to stay with her and helping her get through all the paperwork issues.  Not a fun time.  And my dad was an organized guy who THOUGHT he had taken care of everything up front for her.  It was still a nightmare.",1453157985

10927612,comment,10923885,10923885,0,0,ianamartin,,,"Quick anecdote from an earlier time. My mother&#x27;s college roommate (Marilyn) studied Math and Physics in undergrad in the late &#x27;50s/early &#x27;60s. She went on to do a Masters at MIT and worked on the Apollo project there, which by that time was being run by another woman: Margaret Hamilton.<p>If I remember the story correctly, Marilyn started a PhD, but never finished due to marriage and kids. She went on to have a very happy career at NASA and retired from there eventually, around 1995.<p>She worked in code for almost all of her career. She worked on the Apollo Guidance Computer for at least a couple of years.<p>Her telling of how things were is that there were a lot of women working in what would eventually become the field of computer science. It was a flipped version of what we think of now but with some similarities.<p>It was flipped because women were the higher percentage of the work force in the early &#x27;60s and on into the &#x27;70s and even &#x27;80s. But this was also the same as today because the field itself was really not well-defined, and after people went from punch cards (which is what she started programming with), they went to typing. And for the average Joe, typing was a job for women: it was secretary work.<p>So this seems to me--with the caveat that I&#x27;m remembering some conversations I&#x27;ve had with this women from maybe 10 years ago when I first got interested in software and started having jobs that involved it--that there was a brief opening window at the early stages of the field when there were a lot of women practitioners.<p>As the field became more mainstream and more codified and promised rewards and opportunities, it appears that the guys noticed and came in rather slowly. And then pretty suddenly when it became clear that you could make a quick buck without a crapton of advanced knowledge, the brogrammers showed up and pretty much took over.<p>That&#x27;s obviously only one interpretation, but it&#x27;s an interesting one to me because Marilyn retired before things seem to have got really bad. She retired when the women were still wearing dresses to work, and the men were wearing suits, and things were mostly professional. There were probably glass ceilings, but she didn&#x27;t feel one in her work because NASA has an institutional history of women doing big, important things.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>Another anecdote. This one much shorter.\nA second field that seems to be to being opened up by bro-ish types (and with the incompetence and general lack of knowledge and laziness I associate with that type) is healthcare--specifically Nursing.<p>When I was studying Statistics at the University of North Dakota, I was living in a house with 6 other guys. Two of whom were Nursing students. They would have frat-style parties several times a week. Parties where 35-40 of their nursing school guy friends would come over, play Nickelback all night long and drink shitty beer. Basically the opposite of what I would expect from Nursing students.<p>I found this pretty unexpected and asked once WTF was going on here.<p>The answer was pretty consistent: there&#x27;s a dearth of Nurses. People will pay a lot for them. The barrier to entry is pretty low. Essentially, it&#x27;s quick easy money.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>All this makes me wonder how much of the shift in industry demographics is really driven by institutional sexism and how much it is just that the lowest common denominator will always try to make easy, lazy money. And then the more competent people move elsewhere, or just leave the industry entirely and go do something else.<p>Of course, once you reach a critical mass of bro-ism, the institutional bias <i>does</i> become real. But I wonder if we have a situation in business or IT management that is somewhat akin to the problems we have in U.S. Politics: the only people interested in managing are, by definition, not fit for the job. So smart people give up and walk away to something else.<p>The other thing that it makes me wonder is this: how many other industries are there that started out with one traditional mix of demographics because &quot;that&#x27;s a job for x type of person. Not <i>someone like me</i>. And was then co-opted by the someones-like-me.<p>Anyway, sorry for a long musing. Just trying to put some puzzle pieces together here to see if there&#x27;s a larger idea to digest.",1453157540

Say buying a $200 desktop with a wireless keyboard and mouse.<p>Lots of users want simplicity on their TVs, not power. The Apple TV is easier to set up and use than a PC. (When I looked a number of years ago, it was also quieter and drew less power, but PCs have probably caught up.) The experience of using a keyboard and mouse is also awful from a couch without weird trays or additional furniture. A $150 Apple TV is also cheaper than a $200 PC + keyboard + mouse.<p>For an appliance that plays YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, streaming music, media from an iTunes library, and can stream audio and video from your phone and computer, the Apple TV works pretty dang well.<p>That said, I have a fourth generation Apple TV after previously having owned a third gen. The fourth gen has a lot of potential, but has not yet pushed TV forward. I&#x27;ve used the App Store mostly to get new sources of audio and video to stream. I haven&#x27;t yet found any killer app interactive experiences that are more compelling than they would be on other screens.

It won&#x27;t kill lowest <i>quality</i> content producers. On the contrary, it will kill the higher-quality content producers (as it in fact does), because quality content is more expensive to make than crap one. The optimized variable is profitability, which right now is strongly tied to view count - therefore you get more and more viral, easy to make content, made of every cheap mind hack we can think of.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about your second paragraph - you say &quot;regression to the mean&quot; and &quot;permanent&quot;, as if regression to the mean wasn&#x27;t by definition the default state of the system, and hence permanent (absent default-changing influences). My belief is though that the degeneration of mass media is a continuous process driven by the market, so as long as the market incentives are in place, no regression is going to happen.

For example, in Liechtenstein&#x27;s 1968 referendum on women&#x27;s suffrage, even nearly half the women wanted to deny themselves the vote [1]. A bad case of Stockholm Syndrome, perhaps, but indicative of how powerful established stereotypes can be.

10927356,comment,10922774,10926965,0,0,api,,,"Look at Flint, Michigan. The water system is failing. In some areas of the American interior we&#x27;re at the level of a full blown collapse of civilization. It&#x27;s the sort of future the peak oil doomers talked about, but it doesn&#x27;t have much to do with oil and obviously isn&#x27;t distributed evenly. Go to New York and you can find people spending more than your average Flint resident&#x27;s income on their dogs. It&#x27;s industrial collapse but not for ecological reasons.<p>This long-term depression (since around 2000-2001) is hidden in the data because the data we look at is <i>aggregate</i>. The collapse in the interior is outweighed on aggregate statistics by the booms that have occurred in places like SF, NYC, LA, Seattle, etc. These are places with closer links to finance and higher tech industries. The interior of the country was always the center of bedrock industry, but all that&#x27;s been replaced by China.<p>IMHO anyone who argues otherwise is deluded, wrong, or a liar. Just visit a place like Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, etc. and look around a bit. The collapse is viscerally real and physically tangible. Everywhere you will see failing infrastructure, desperate cities installing casinos and other vapid quick-fix ways to stimulate commerce, and people with raging heroin and meth habits and loads of alcoholism. Hard drug addiction is a clear historical indicator of deep depression and social collapse. Then talk to young people and university graduates. You will find that all the best are leaving as soon as they can and that the dream of every young person is to get out.<p>The Midwest is where I&#x27;m from. Last time I was there it was a little bit scary. All the gun talk, fear and hatred talk, meth mouth at gas stations and grocery stores, and the general <i>smell</i> of collapse and pessimism. I grew up there and I&#x27;ve watched this happen. It was not like this in the 1990s. There&#x27;s always been a bit of a gap between places like NYC and the &quot;flyover country&quot; but it was never, ever this extreme. Now it feels like third vs. first world. I actually almost felt unsafe there. I could feel this edge of alarming despair that triggered some kind of hindbrain &quot;watch your back&quot; emotion in me. My wife said the same thing.<p>Automation&#x27;s role has been minimal so far when compared to the massive effect of wage arbitrage, but if self-driving trucks hit the mainstream we&#x27;re going to see the bottom really fall out and it&#x27;s going to be ugly... like rural USSR in the late 80s and early 90s ugly. Trucking and related industries are a major employer in the interior and it&#x27;s been one of the few jobs that can&#x27;t be outsourced. Of course this new technology will add new jobs: on the coasts to write the software and overseas to manufacture everything.<p>If this trend continues we&#x27;re looking at a future not terribly unlike The Hunger Games (there&#x27;s a reason these books are popular): mega-rich enclaves surrounded by &quot;districts&quot; that have reverted to something resembling a 19th century standard of living but with smart phones (and ubiquitous surveillance, drone attacks, etc.). Either that or there will be a backlash, possibly an <i>over-reaction</i> that tips completely into socialism or fascism. That&#x27;s the other thing I heard the last few times I was there: depending on whether they leaned right or left people were almost ready to vote for that Hitler guy or that Lenin guy. Trump and Sanders are much, much milder cousins of these... expect far more radical and dangerous versions of both if nothing changes. Think Trump without the restraint and integrity or Sanders without any lingering belief in the American way... and both without any belief in the rule of law. You could even see a... well... &quot;national socialist&quot; hybrid: a warmonger Sanders or a socialist Trump.<p>Of course the globalists will retort that eventually wages will rise in places like China and the tide will start to balance if not actually reverse. That&#x27;s the theory and indeed it <i>would</i> work if places like China were actually being run for the benefit of their citizens and if those citizens were allowed to participate in the global economy. But China&#x27;s currency devaluation and continued clamp-downs on both free speech and free international movement of capital tell me that the few dozen party elite families that basically own China have other ideas. China is a cheap labor farm where its people are exploited as a resource, effectively a form of &quot;light&quot; slave labor, and all the benefits are to be captured by the Chinese Communist Party (China, Inc.) and its officials and state-linked industry leaders. If this view is indeed correct then the great outsourcing wave will <i>never</i> reverse and Western workers will forever have to compete with a 1.2 billion head work force held at perpetually deflated wages through currency manipulation and uneven trade agreements. The invalid assumption of globalism is that the leaders of other countries actually share liberal democratic values. They clearly do not. The slaves exist to serve, thank you very much, and this silly notion of universal human prosperity is for woo-woo Western liberals.<p>I do not blame the Chinese one bit. While we&#x27;re de-industrializing they are getting screwed out of the first world status they&#x27;ve worked for all their lives. They were promised a gleaming future and they&#x27;re huffing heavy metals instead while the buying power of their money is cut by edict. I blame their &quot;owners&quot; and the folks getting rich off this situation while deluding themselves about the realities. I do think there&#x27;s a fair amount of self-delusion in places like Washington where lots of people want to believe the lets-all-sing-kumbaya globalist narrative. It would indeed be wonderful if it were true but I see absolutely no sign of any of the upside happening.<p>At least that&#x27;s my pessimistic view. I hope I&#x27;m wrong. In any case I think this explains both Trump and Sanders, both of whom in their own way are running on an anti-globalist platform of reversing the above. I can&#x27;t say I disagree all that much. The time may be near to call bullshit on China (and the whole globalist model) and erect import tariffs in proportion to the relative cost of foreign wages (and environmental protections, etc.). In other words: tax slave labor. Maybe the US can use the money to invade its interior and build roads and schools. I just hope we can do it without sacrificing liberal democracy and without starting WWIII.<p>As for Silicon Valley and the much ballyhooed collapse: don&#x27;t fret much. There will likely be a pullback but the worst that will happen is the collapse of a few overvalued startups, a retrenchment, and a restart of the next cycle of growth. History is on our side, economically speaking. The thing to worry about is the naked fascism or punitive socialism about to bubble up from the massive inland region of America you&#x27;ve forgotten exists. While you are forced to endure a lack of catered sushi the interior will be experiencing yet another ratchet-step down. It didn&#x27;t see the boom but it <i>will</i> see the bust.",1453154764

You have to motivate yourself by imagining that most people are pretty happy based on downloads/client-count/whatever.<p>- People aren&#x27;t good at communicating when they&#x27;re frustrated but they usually turn into nice people once you&#x27;ve fixed the problem.  Most people just have a job to do and a deadline to meet.  Pay attention to what they say is wrong, and not their mood.<p>- Strangely, people will spend great amounts of time writing comments on random web sites or review pages about issues that they will <i>never even E-mail you about</i>, no matter how easy you make it for them to contact you.  Therefore, if you <i>really</i> want to get some realistic critiques of your work, you may have to scour the web for them.  I look at it this way: real, honest feedback is <i>rare</i> and <i>vital</i> to really understand what you may have overlooked.  Even if you can&#x27;t possibly contact the Random Web Commenter, find and fix their issues and you&#x27;ll end up with a better product.",1453154659

The Rift itself is $600 (which I think is entirely reasonable, by the way) but in order to drive the Rift properly you also need a computer capable of producing TWO simultaneous (minimum) 1080p+ 90fps outputs, and even a lot of off-the-shelf gaming PCs can&#x27;t really do that without sacrificing a great deal of graphical quality.<p>That might be what &quot;casual&quot; means for VR for a while, graphics that hearken back to the early ages of 3D on consoles.",1453154623

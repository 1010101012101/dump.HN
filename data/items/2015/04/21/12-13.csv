There are definitely cultural factors that influence what we consider small or large. For example, London has the London Housing Design guide which recommends a one bedroom flat for <i>two people</i> to be a minimum of 50 square metres. I don&#x27;t think that’s palatial or excessive. It&#x27;s still less than what many other European countries recommend (it’s 20% less than what Germany recommends which is 60 square metres for a one bed flat for two people [1])<p>In the article, it states that UK developer Pocket Living are building 38 square metre one-bed flats. 38 square metres is fine for one person, but not for two people in my opinion. These apartments may have high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows, but they are usually single-aspect and narrow in length (with the windows at the narrow end) in order to fit as many units into the available plot of land.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of this micro apartment trend. Housing lasts for decades and future generations will have to take over and live in this micro-housing stock. Is this the housing legacy we should leave future generations?<p>[1] The Case for Space report (PDF) from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)  published in September 2011: \n<a href=""http://www.architecture.com/files/ribaholdings/policyandinternationalrelations/homewise/caseforspace.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.architecture.com/files/ribaholdings/policyandinte...</a>",1429620899

9413633,comment,9412872,9412872,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"Animal experimentation is horrible and terrible. Even in the most ethical of studies suffering is inflicted upon animals that otherwise would not have happened; entire genotypes of animals doomed to additional suffering have been bred in some cases. But the alternative is far worse: to not perform these animal studies, or rather for some privileged group to use force to prevent others from performing such studies, and so bring progress in medicine to a grinding halt. Without animal studies there would be no new meaningful advances in medical science. It is a harsh and unpleasant aspect of the human condition that forcing suffering upon animals in the course of scientific studies is necessary to advance both human and veterinary medicine. A few suffer for the benefit of many - an equation that should make any sane and compassionate person uncomfortable.<p>Animal studies are even required to refine the science needed to move beyond animal studies. Ethics and morality aside, studies employing animals are expensive and time-consuming. Given the choice, scientists would much rather experiment on cells in a dish, or on slabs of unfeeling cultured tissue, or upon simulations of animals, if these methods would generate results of the same quality.<p>In comparison to what might be and what is possible, we live in a barbaric age of suffering, war, death, and sundry other horrors that we like to keep behind the curtains and out of the mind&#x27;s eye. But barbaric as it is, this age is far better than the past by all such measures. We no longer absolutely, definitely need to slaughter animals for food to sustain the populace, for example, and rates of violence between humans are far lower than in the pre-modern era of tribes and universal poverty. The option stands open today for a society of vegetarians: it is practical from a technological and economic standpoint. That we have not moved rapidly in that direction is our shame, and our descendants will look back on us as savages for this and many other reasons.<p>Those people who criticize and take action against the use of animals in medical research should first look to their diets, and then to the practice of farming animals. Vast and expansive animal suffering is caused in the name of putting meat into the marketplace - greater many times over each month than in all the animal experiments in modern history. Persuade the omnivores of the human race to relinquish their participation in the meat market before savaging the medical science that will benefit both man and beast.<p>In short, the human condition is a rotted, cloying swamp, but we&#x27;re closer to the edge than we were - no longer up to our necks in it, we now have the luxury of finding more of our surroundings to be disgusting and primitive. The way out to solid ground is forward, through more of the same, until our biotechnology becomes good enough to do away with the suffering we must inflict upon animals in order to build better medicine. Perhaps along the way, societies will arise whose members also reject the needless suffering we presently choose to inflict upon animals in order to eat the same diet as our ancestors.",1429620529

High speed rail does two things, eats up a lot of money and takes riders of slower rail. Even Japan has seen this as when the amount of high speed rail made available increased overall ridership decreased.<p>there is a lot of romance about trains but in the end they cost more per mile to build, use, and maintain, that even flying, in many areas. Slower than flying except over short distances and less convenient and timely over that short distance compared to cars. Public light rail is a boon doggle in many US cities, the costs to implement are beyond any reasonable time table of recovery.<p>Freight is king of the rail in the US, even Europe envies its status here and that makes a far greater impact on the environment than moving people<p>[1] <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/5711595/KS-DA-09-001-EN.PDF/9c90d489-5009-4acc-9810-ae39612897d3?version=1.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/5711595/KS-DA...</a>",1429619176

The US alone has been pumping trillions after trillions into the US and global economy, which has not resulted in general official inflation. But that money went somewhere, and it went into corporate coffers, financial houses, and the private pockets of the wealthy who are all &quot;investing&quot; it like it&#x27;s not their money, which it isn&#x27;t really.<p>I am not sure, but it does not strike me that there is another example of the current type of scenario in all of humanity&#x27;s history. It&#x27;s not like the lead up to the 1929 market crash because there are no margin calls since the government just gave away free money and even paid the wealthy and their shell organizations, aka, corporations to steal even more money. It&#x27;s just unimaginable amounts of money sloshing around in the global market without anything productive to apply itself to. It doesn&#x27;t want to construct residential in the US because that would depress prices and rents, it keeps being pumped into land and real assets and maintaining artificial housing and rent prices, ....<p>Although I think there is a great storage of inflation just barely being held back by a policy dam, if that dam doesn&#x27;t break, I think the outcome, the effect will be a social one. Desperate regimes of the wealthy paranoid about losing the wealth they looted will resort to ever increasing repression to assure their Precious remains with them and their heirs for generation after generation.<p>Progress is made when there are constraints and problems need solving and things need improving. But what happens when we are all essentially trust fund babies that have no parameters, no limitations, losses are meaningless because it&#x27;s not money we earned, and &quot;success&quot; is easily seen as such because it is measured by state rather than delta. By all current measures, if  you have a successful business / economy no one really cares that you essentially bought the facade of success with your undeserved trust fund / made up money. We can see the effects on the poor, where the impact of our policies are being felt in silent suffering. I suspect the result of at least the last 10 years of policy will be an era of impoverishment not seen in 100 years in the USA in the short term, and another era in human history of stagnation and eventual oppression as humanity turns in on itself if the unearned, and unwarranted wealth is not recalled. Ultimately, what wealth, i.e., money is, is a relative measure of power and especially the US government gave the crooks that defrauded us and almost destroyed America the keys to the vault.",1429619165

While I agree not everything fits into XP, you can&#x27;t classify it like that.<p>Mob programming is not classical XP, but it is in the same spirit of pair programming. It can burn a lot of money per feature developed and LOC written, you need to also consider the mentoring/learning aspect of it. Same goes with pair programming. It isn&#x27;t only about code quality. It is about mentoring/sharing/learning.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong- if you&#x27;ve never pair programmed for a long time before, you don&#x27;t know really understand the meaning of the word &quot;annoyance&quot;, and if you don&#x27;t have the right setup, one person may zone-out and not really be helping.<p>Doing it right is an art. If you learn a way to do it correctly, it will really help: your developers will be more productive because they learn from each other, there will be less churn resulting from any formal code reviews that might be required if you need formal sign-off (if required at all) and there will be fewer bugs. Fewer bugs mean: less work for helpdesk/customer service, fewer adversely affected users within the company, fewer periods when you aren&#x27;t taking orders/etc. which cause lost revenue and customer frustration which can lead to them telling others about their bad experience and losing additional opportunities, etc.<p>But, odds are unless you try things out, tune them, try again, no matter what methodology you choose, you&#x27;re going to get something wrong.

Some times multiple times. (btw--she had horrid dexterity)<p>I asked her why they didn&#x27;t administer some type of anesthetic--or kill the animals humanely.<p>She told me they couldn&#x27;t because chemicals might affect the brain, or body chemistry when analyzing the tissues.<p>She told me endless stories about needless experiments on animals by students and faculty.  They were not doing cutting edge research.  She even admitted a lot of it was validating \nCurrent studies--so students could finish their studies in order to get that advance degree.<p>I finally told her enough.  She wasn&#x27;t a bad person, just looking for the respect a advance degree in neurobiology would bring her.  She wanted respect, and felt the degree would provide that.<p>She dropped out of the program for personal reasons(she couldn&#x27;t keep up with the studies mainly) and spent\nthe next 10 years taking party drugs in San Francisco.  She is now a vegetarian.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is regulating the treatment on campuses in the United States?  My nephew is taking a biology class at a little college in Los Angeles.  I asked them if they are still pithing frogs in order to basically show the students the heart will beat once severed from the frog.  He said they are still doing this in freshman biology.<p>So, there are no regulations in the United States on the treatment rodents and amphibians in schools and labs. I can state that with a fair amount of confidence!  (The school he dropped out of was a private liberal arts school that accepted any kid who could come up with the tuition)<p>We need to, at the least, stop killing animals on campuses in order to teach art student majors--biology and anatomy.<p>Years ago some Researcher put a plywood cover on his truck.

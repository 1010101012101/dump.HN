If your friends are silent/neutral/negative, hang out with other hackers/entrepreneurs (join/start a group in your locale).",1215601026

If I was in the fashion industry and I knew that it was either have a booth at the Big Fashion Expo in September or wait until next September, I would opt for the $25,000 now since I could get started now - the $25000 would be more valuable to me now than $50k would be in January when we don't have any buyers.",1215600816

It's tough to do, for sure - I type slower today, no doubt - but my wrists hurt less.<p>If productivity is your main goal, I just don't think switching would help. Let's say that someone tells you that a Dvorak keyboard can helkp you type 5% faster. Fine - but it will take 4-6 months to get to that point and, during that adjustment period, you will have have been 5% less productive.",1215600655

If you write Perl that uses an obscure (and perhaps undocumented/unintentional) feature to accomplish some relatively straightforward task, other Perl programmers will worship you as a God. The language and the culture are mutually reinforcing. Ruby is going this way as well.<p>Python language and culture both place a premium on doing things the simplest and most explicit way you can. Over the long run, the culture makes the biggest difference.",1215599750
240976,comment,240000,240066,0,0,demallien,,,"Yup, it's the problem space that is hard, not the implementation.<p>A good way of seeing this is to look at languages that have ""solved"" concurrency issues, such as Erlang.  I mean, sure, you won't have concurrency problems in Erlang, but that comes at the price of only having immutable variables...<p>I think the problem with concurrency is that certain things that we do in sequential programming are provably impossible to do reliably in concurrent programming.  So we end up using traditional languages, such as C/Java/Python, which are very error prone because we can only correctly use a subset of the language features, and it's not clear what the subset is, or we can use a language such as Erlang, which explicitly enforces concurrency-correct code, but then we find programming in such languages very restrictive.<p>Meh.  I'm not enough of a language wonk to figure this one out!",1215599735

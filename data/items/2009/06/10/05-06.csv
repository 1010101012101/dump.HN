650642,comment,650620,650620,0,0,whughes,,,"To me, the most interesting aspect of the post was the comparison between Bing and the old Live. I'd have liked to see a Live-Google comparison and perhaps Yahoo! as well, since it's often thrown around as a comparable alternative.<p>This seems to confirm my idea that Bing is less a revamp to the search engine and more a rebranding for Microsoft. Bing is certainly more memorable than Live or MSN were, and it's replacing Live and other MS brands in several non-search areas (Virtual Earth -> Bing Maps for Enterprise, for example). That's certainly nothing new for Microsoft, but this time they seem to be marketing it as a search engine change to get people to try the engine and hopefully switch from the big G.",1244613145

They also overuse acronyms and pack them too densely (PSP, MP3..).<p>The Kubuntu listing is better than the Ubuntu page, but still not there. There's overuse of bullet points, which limit detail. Everything is generally too terse and badly-organized.<p>They rely on prior knowledge and don't explain what the improvements mean to the users. What is this? ""The new plasma-widget-network-manager replaces the old KNetworkManager applet."" What does that mean to me, a new Kubuntu user?<p>Apple does it better. They have nice delineation of features, so you don't have to go looking for information. It's also listed in much more detail, which is the main problem with the OSS lists.<p>Actually, looking at both pages, it seems like the Kubuntu people are doing something fundamentally different. They're listing new versions of software, briefly detailing the changes, and pointing to the software changelogs. Apple is talking about the OS as a whole and dividing it into parts. They're not saying ""iChat updated to version X""; they're saying ""iChat in Snow Leopard has features Y and Z.""",1244612892

Why pick things to specialize in at the expense of other things you elect not to?<p>Specialization is not free; it decreases flexibility, and would seem that it would decrease cross-pollination of ideas from different areas of knowledge. It increases income, for sure, but also increases the attendant risk that people won't have need for an X specialist right at that moment, or at least no one you would want to work for.<p>I'll grant that generalization is not free either. Someone who really needs an X specialist will pay top dollar, because the supply is likely pretty low. And people may not trust a generalist to go and implement some specialized X performing application.<p>I think there are opportunities and attendant risks for both. I really don't think either one wins outright. But, I'll be happy to listen to words of wisdom you might have on this.",1244611841

When you take your modulus, you're going to mix well, regardless of whether its prime or not.  This is what the article (accidentally, apparently) confirms.<p>The win of using a prime modulus comes when you have a non-uniformly distributed input set (though of course you could craft an especially evil input set).  Mod prime is just more likely to produce a more uniform mix across a larger set of input distributions.<p>Since we're talking about a general-purpose hash table, we can't assume we know anything about our inputs (i.e., that they're uniformly distributed), so we use a prime number of buckets just to up the odds that we come out ahead.",1244610703

Any decent hash for integers that doesn't throw bits away is going to produce a nice even distribution for that kind of sequence no matter what the divisor.<p>The problem with hash tables is bad hash functions, or hash functions which perform badly on certain data, where ""perform badly"" means recurrence of certain patterns, usually ""latent periods"", i.e. too many function results that are divisible by some number or one of some set of numbers. If those numbers have factors in common with the bucket count, then there's going to be trouble.<p>For example, a poor hash function might turn up even numbers twice as often as odd numbers; if the bucket count is also even, then the even buckets will have 50% more collisions than the odd buckets, on average. A prime number of buckets guarantees that there's only one factor that can clash, rather than a bunch of them.",1244610700

1061879,comment,1061735,1061840,0,0,pegobry,,,"The signup pages are an example of a broader mindset which is different at Tumblr and at Posterous and which in turn, to me, exemplifies broader trends for startups. That's what I think is interesting.<p>I'm not saying startups should not be metrics-driven. Design and engineering are both driven by metrics. But they're different mindsets. And in this case, one is clearly winning.<p>You're also right that the zero-sum fallacy is wrong. However, those two companies <i>are</i> competitors in the market and one, at least on publicly available data, is winning hands down.",1263898509
1061878,comment,1061657,1061756,0,0,devin,,,"I agree with you but I do sympathise with one creative dilemma I've run into over and over again with digital music.<p>The number of options you have is overwhelming.  On a certain level I appreciate the number of options I'm afforded.  On the other hand I feel like 'tweaking this' and 'changing that' takes a front seat, and the actual production of something worthwhile gets left behind.<p>Take a look at all of the overproduced albums you hear these days.  It's not digital music's fault-- but it's a common problem.",1263898403

1061876,comment,1061735,1061839,0,0,pegobry,,,"Thanks.<p>Am I trolling? I don't think so, insofar as I use a provocative example to illustrate trends that I do think are important: the coming of age of New York as a startup hub and as a ""school"" for building consumer startups, and the growing importance of design vs. ""hard"" technology in building a successful consumer web app.",1263898349

1061874,comment,1061735,1061781,0,0,pegobry,,,"You're right that Tumblr's social aspects are more developed than Posterous's and that this has been a huge driver of their growth but to me that's not so much solving two different problems as Tumblr being more smartly designed -- realizing that blogging, even minimalist blogging, is inherently social.<p>As for Tumblr's top tier investors -- sure, that's true. I was trying to emphasize that Posterous, on paper, has everything it takes to win.",1263898223

1061864,comment,1061668,1061668,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"OK, so now you know it can be done in 19 tries, let's see if it can be done in fewer.  Let's go for 18.<p>That means I can first drop the egg from the 18th floor and if it breaks, try 1 through 17.  If it doesn't break then I've used one attempt and I'm allowed 17 more.<p>Let's try the 35th floor.  If it breaks then I can try 19 through 34, again a maximum of 18 (2 already plus another 16).  If it doesn't break then I've used two attempts and I'm allowed 16 more.<p>Continuing like this I can get up to 171, and spotting that pattern shows that 171 is 18x(18+1)/1, or the sum of numbers 1 through 18.<p>OK, so I should be able to get 100 floors with a starting value of 14. 14x(14+1)/2 = 105, and a check check shows I can do that.<p>So I can do it in 14, which I'm pretty sure is less than your 19.  Given that you asked:<p><pre><code>    What is the minimum number of tries\n    needed to find that information?\n</code></pre>\nI think you're wrong.<p>In fact, I think the author has been seduced by the ""double up till you exceed your target, then fill in the gap"" strategy.  He has then stopped at what he thinks is a good solution without really investigating further.  That is, in this case inappropriate.<p>The better strategy is ""divide and conquer.""<p>So let's drop the egg from the 50th floor.  Whether it breaks or not we can use the other egg to cover the half we want, so using at most 1+50 tests.<p>But the two halves aren't equal, firstly because if it doesn't break we can use it again in the top half, dropping it from 75, and secondly because we've already used one drop.<p>This is, of course, all assuming that eggs are completely undamaged/unchanged by all these drops, but I've treated this as the puzzle you intended, rather than haring off on creative side-tracks.  I'm assuming you want someone uncreative.<p>Do I get the job?",1263897629

1061860,comment,1061634,1061841,0,0,rms,,,"My business has no retail presence so a printed catalog is unnecessary. At this point it doesn't make sense for me to switch to another shopping cart, but I think you're going after a perfectly fine market. The market for online store builders is really quite large; it's mostly a marketing challenge. If you have a strategy for reaching out to businesses in your region I think you're going to do fine.",1263897468

1061840,comment,1061735,1061735,0,0,karzeem,,,"There seems to be a contradiction in his argument.  He talks a lot about the signup pages, focusing on what he guesses is Tumblr's much higher conversion rate and the reasons for why that conversion rate is high.  Shortly thereafter, he lays into Posterous for being too metrics-driven.  How could a company that's too metrics-driven let themselves get crushed (again, according to the author's guess) on something as important as signup page conversions?<p>The whole piece has this arbitrary anti-Silicon Valley animus that I don't really get and which doesn't seem to serve any purpose.<p>It's useful to talk about conversion rates, the importance of good UI/UX, and what Tumblr and Posterous do or don't do well, but the broader, hand-waving indictment of Silicon Valley doesn't add anything.<p>(Also, the author doesn't directly do this, but articles like this can falsely suggest that the two companies at hand are playing a zero-sum game.)",1263895370

7554597,comment,7550950,7551105,1,0,Ologn,,,"> At the undergraduate level you&#x27;ll get out what you put in. If you confirm computer science as what you want to do and pursue it with rigor, name schools will be an option at the graduate level. One thing about academia is that performance tends to open doors.<p>Right.  If you do well for your Bachelors, with a good GPA, good subject understanding, and a good relationship with some of your professors, you can always get an MS from a better school.  Finances may be less of a problem then as you may get a research position or be a TA for an undergrad class when you are getting your MS.  For professors you get along with, or if you are particularly interested in their area of expertise, be sure to develop a small relationship with them, go to their office hours even if you don&#x27;t need to, and maybe they have a friend at MIT, Stanford etc. and can write you a letter of recommendation for them to get into their graduate school.<p>If you tell people you got your Phd from Stanford and your MS from MIT, where you got your undergrad from is suddenly of much less concern.  It&#x27;s not all about the name anyway, a motivated UF undergrad is probably better off in the long run then an unmotivated undergrad at a slightly more prestigious school.  If you spend five months in a class studying assembly and processors and your professor is not so good, read the textbook, write some assembly on your own, read other textbooks and books.  I often went beyond the necessary, required reading if the subject was interesting and/or important.<p>Also look for research lab openings for undegrads at your school.  Talk to the other CS students at your school, the department advisors etc., get on mailing lists, go to events, related campus clubs etc.",1396976175

Using a language where the language runtime itself handles such things only serves to abstract away potential errors from the programmer, and prevents the programmer from doing things in more efficient ways when she wants to. It can also be less performant, since the runtime has to do things in more generic ways than the programmer would.<p>> Including people responsible for one of the most important security-related library in the world.<p>I think you&#x27;ve hit on a crucial part of the problem: practically every software company on Earth uses OpenSSL, but not many of them pay people to work on it.<p><pre><code>  calvinow@Mozart ~/git/openssl $ git log --format=&#x27;%aE&#x27; | grep -Po &quot;@.*&quot; | sort -u - \n  @baggins.org\n  @benl-macbookpro3.local\n  @chromium.org\n  @cloudflare.com\n  @comodo.com\n  @cryptsoft.com\n  @esperi.org.uk\n  @fh-muenster.de\n  @fifthhorseman.net\n  @fsmat.at\n  @gmail.com\n  @google.com\n  @igalia.com\n  @infradead.org\n  @innominate.com\n  @leeds.pl\n  @linaro.org\n  @links.org\n  @neurodiverse.org\n  @openssl.org\n  @opensslfoundation.com\n  @pobox.com\n  @roeckx.be\n  @secondstryke.com\n  @torproject.org\n  @trevp.net\n  @v3.sk\n  @velox.ch\n</code></pre>\nI was very surprised how short that list is.

7554588,comment,7546394,7546394,1,0,mfheretic,,,"[I posted this on the MMC website, should have posted here! Mildly edited to relfect context here]<p>I get bogged down in such interest rate debates, so decided to put my money where my mouth is and lend on Zidisha - MY loans, MY transactions, MY calculations. I uploaded $1000. 18 months later (in fact slightly less as I did this in two batches of $500, minor detail) my cash + pending loans + outstanding capital is $1006. For all practical purposes let&#x27;s say I am at break-even. I made some money in interest, however calculated, and I lost some money in defaults, late payments and foreign exchange losses. Overall these cancelled out (in fact I am $6 up). My average interest rate that I charged, weighted by the amount I bid, was 4.4% (flat per year I believe). I had a few late payments, one outright default, and I have no idea how much forex losses cost me. To repeat, this all largely cancelled out.<p>I then looked at the average interest rates as stated by Zidisha only for the clients I had lent to. These were 9.31%, but included the 5% fee that Zidisha charged, so it appeared that the average investor was charging 4.31%, marginally lower than me. Indeed, I lent to a few people who were unwilling to pay any interest, and sure enough their stated rate was 5% - the Zidisha fee alone. So, in terms of Zidisha claiming the average LENDER interest rate is 5.3% seems reasonable from my personal lending experience (40 loans to date).<p>I agree that flat rates are inferior. I wish Zidisha would stop this practice. And it is a fair rule of thumb to double them to get a real APR. There is a fragment of truth in the claim that borrowers understand flat interest rates better than APRs, as these are still common in some countries (where they have not yet been outlawed). Claiming the world was flat a few centuries ago was acceptable and commonly accepted, although wrong! I agree with the author that converting to APRs would be better. But, I also agree that the one-off fee for a credit check, in this lending model, does seem reasonable. But I concede that this is a debatable point.<p>So, excluding this one-off fee, it does appear that the loans I have personally done have an APR of about 20% (9.31% x 2). What&#x27;s more, by me charging 4.4% (flat, equivelent to 9% APR), this has covered forex losses and defaults over an 18 month period, almost perfectly (by coincidence). I don&#x27;t lend on Zidisha to make money, but if I can protect my capital, that is fine by me. This is what most other P2Ps will try to offer. MyC4 offers a net return, Kiva is generally break-even. What fascinates me about Zidisha is that there is no intermediary, and the rates do genuinely seem lower. I accept this might not be the case for a first time client on a $50 loan having to pay $12 for the credit check. The one-off fee is the source of the problem. But where do we draw the line - what about the bus fare to get to the office? The cost of completing the forms? The opportunity cost of time in completing the Zidisha process? Yes, there are entry costs to join Zidisha, as there are in many services. Indeed, one could argue these present a barrier to entry to dissuade non-serious potential borrowers.<p>Do not mis-understand me, I am a fanatic for transparent pricing in microfinance.<p>In fact, I should also add that there is an additional fee which I (i.e. from a lender perspective) have to incur that wipes out my measly $6 profit - the PayPal fee, which was $34 in my case. So, in fact, I lost $28. But, a rate of 20%, or 25%, or 30%, is alas pretty reasonable, particularly in Africa. I agree that Zidisha should adopt APRs as soon as possible, but I would be hesitant to describe this as deceptive. There is no pre-funding, at least they make an effort to state the interest rate, which some P2Ps don&#x27;t even attempt. I do hover the mouse over the blue buttoms and was aware that this is flat, and I know how to interpret this, but I may not be typical. But compare this to Kiva, whose greatest effort to explain an interest rate is to state the self-reported, unverified portfolio yield of the bank as copied from the MixMarket often years out of date, and this is not even a good proxy of the APR in my opinion. I did a blog post a year or so ago comparing the stated portfolio yields reported by Kiva compared to the actual APRs calculated by Chuck Waterfield, and the divergence is staggering. Is Zidisha perfect, no? Is it an interesting development, challenging the status quo of the current P2P market? In my opinion, yes. There is scope for improvement, and I hope they constantly remain aware of this, but so far I find this a promising venture. It will be interesting to see how it scales up.<p>Hugh Sinclair, author/consultant\nwww.microfinancetransparency.com",1396976082

Outside of Rails and Django, you&#x27;re left to make a lot of decisions to get the same level of functionality before you can start building even an MVP.<p>Here&#x27;s what you get out of the box with Rails:<p>1) Database schema management via Rails migrations which work great with mature RBMSs like Postgres and MySQL.<p>2) A solid ORM (ActiveRecord) which makes CRUD super easy and intuitive.<p>3) An active community with lots of open source libraries (gem) to do just about anything you want.<p>4) Highly productive ways to work with frontend (CoffeeScript) and backend (routing, controllers, active_record, etc).<p>5) Great documentation and ecosystem around it.<p>Contrast this with Go, Node, and other OSS ecosystems and you&#x27;re often left to make a lot of the decisions on your own with immature libraries. Often to get to the same place, you&#x27;ll be inventing a lot of your own infrastructure.<p>Node is probably the closest to approaching a &quot;batteries included&quot; status with the MEAN stack, but it&#x27;s not quite there yet.<p>You can certainly get all of what Rails comes with out of the box on any stack, but unless you know it really well, there&#x27;s a lot of decisions to be made.

7554315,comment,7550668,7553628,1,0,netcan,,,"That may be true in for a single founder at the bootstrap phase. For a company where the founder/boss doesn&#x27;t directly make all the decisions finding, negotiating, getting approval and avoiding the many pitfalls of working with freelancers transaction costs are very high. Interestingly, very large firms can get to the point where inefficiencies from centralization exceed the cost of transactions. IE, armies of &quot;graphic designers&quot; producing  a trickle substandard work at massive expense.<p>I really do suggest you look at Coase&#x27; paper. To me, its a great example of what economics can do. It&#x27;s very accessible. The logic goes:<p>We know competitive markets are better than centralized ones at a national level. So, why are individual firms so large, centralized and horizontal? Wouldn&#x27;t Microsoft or Walmart benefit from being many small independent units freely transacting with each other? Why do we even have firms? Why don&#x27;t individuals just sell their service to each other?<p>The answer is usually &quot;economies of scale&quot; which is a semi-tautological answer. Why does &quot;scale&quot; need to be achieved by a a firm. A market can have scale too. Horizontal scale (eg a company with its own IT department) actually prevents the usual examples of economies of scale from occurring.<p>The paper argues (in my opinion very convincingly) that &quot;transaction costs&quot; are the main reason that firms exist. Transaction costs are responsible for horizontal companies.  The enormous level of inefficiency caused by the centralization of firms (think East vs West Germany) needs to be offset by even more enormous transaction coss.<p>One difference that happens when you internalize this point is that you can imagine a lot of slack existing ins systems like this. Hours worked is one example (but not the only one). It&#x27;s possible that the deliver guy will earn more in fewer hours, Uber will earn more than the parcel deliver companies and parcel delivery will become cheaper and better all drawing from this pool of wasted potential.

Or are you asking why there are more open-source coding projects versus designers? And what do you mean by &quot;attract&quot;? Do you mean in terms of popularity, or in participation?<p>Either way, I believe part of the cause is the inherent nature of the medium. When I commit new code to an open source project, the maintainer can easily see the diff, and in most big projects, there is automated testing and benchmarking so that the maintainer doesn&#x27;t even have to do the full-regression testing themselves.<p>Furthermore, well-organized code libraries are divided into components...it&#x27;s easier to chip away at these small units (whether they be files or function bodies) than it is to chip away at, say, a logo-image, that multiple people are working on.<p>Philosophically, code is more straightforward. While programmers may debate certain issues of style and design, if I were to take an existing code file and slash it in half, while increasing performance by 50% and not killing readability...and pass the automated test suite, there would be little debate about merging in my change.<p>However, how do you increase the &quot;performance&quot; of a visual design? There is no standard on aesthetically-performant, so  cutting/adding 50% to a design means nothing on paper, and of course, there&#x27;s not much in the way of regression/benchmark test suites for visual design.

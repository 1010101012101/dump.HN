Consider how the North and South ""flipped"" from Democrat to Republican, but someone without a history textbook would never guess that it had been the Democrats who seceded.",1205304917

That isn't too far of a stretch for my imagination, seeing as N.YC has much higher comment quality and community cohesion.<p>Second, if the TC users came here and destroyed the signal to noise ratio we currently enjoy, he would have done them a disservice by recommending a web site that was so quickly destroyed after they all discovered it. Of course, few of them would likely realize that they, themselves, were the cause of the downturn.<p>Clearly neither of those seem like they're going to happen, based on the referral numbers that Paul posted so far, but it was a more feasible option when I made my earlier post.",1205304839
134973,comment,134918,134918,0,0,hiroaki,,,"I agree with the general idea that delegates from swing states should count for more.<p>The problem is your function doesn't really <i>maximize</i> the win probability either. I am not an expert here, but there may be a way to more accurately characterize the probability. Also, your function blows up when ""average spread"" tends to 0. An appropriate sigmoid transform should fix that.",1205304750

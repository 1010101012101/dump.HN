From the article:<p>""Situation 7: you have a small, lightweight startup company filled with cool young people with long blue-tinted hair and nose rings and tongue rivets and hip black clothes and iphones and whatever the hell else young people have these days. You use Ruby on Rails for your site...""<p>lol",1182560211

It may be that some places were better simply because they had smarter employees or more interesting work irrespective of the perks. Moreover, you would need to define the sort of ""culture and atmosphere"" that you would like to obtain and consider its impact on individuality.",1182560135

30205,comment,30182,30203,0,0,paul,,,"Nonsense. The ""perks"" have a lot to do with improving the culture and atmosphere of a place. I've worked at a number of companies with different ""perks"" (MS, Sun, Intel, and Google), and I can tell you that it is very important. At this point, I would say that any tech company that _doesn't_ offer things like free on-site food is stupidly shortsighted.",1182559309

There's always one that's better in that regard and that's the one you should pick regardless of perks.  And so the perks are irrelevant, and indeed, insulting.",1182557499

Being happy at work makes you more productive.  For me this comes first from having a sense of purpose and importance.<p>After that, the little things start to matter.  I'd be happier working for a company that had an on site gym, free food/beverages, and weekly draw for some gizmo like an iPod.  Some things may strike me as a waste of money on occasion, but never insulting.  <p>It's not like they're holding a can of jolt over your head asking you to sit.  They're trying to make you happier at work and carve one more notch to differentiate them from another employer.",1182556854

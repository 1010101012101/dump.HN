If you don&#x27;t trust my summary of it, and you consider yourself very, very well-briefed on what Bitcoin is doing under the hood and who the players are in the Bitcoin community, just read the next ~12 hours of logs.  It&#x27;s absolutely riveting.<p>My summary:<p>The Bitcoin protocol doesn&#x27;t exist.  The only protocol which matters is the actual behavior of the Bitcoin Core client -- the one originally coded by Satoshi, which forms a supermajority of the network.  Bitcoin Core released version 0.8 on or about March 11, 2013.  This differed from Bitcoin Core 0.7 in at least one respect, which was that 0.7 used Berkeley DB and 0.8 did not.<p>BDB has a configuration issue, specifying the maximum number of locks it can use at once.  If you attempt to use more, it returns an error.<p>Here&#x27;s one reason I say the Bitcoin Protocol doesn&#x27;t exist: No sane person says &quot;An important feature of the Bitcoin Protocol is that conforming clients MUST REJECT any Bitcoin transaction which would exhaust the default number of locks available to the Berkeley DB.&quot;<p>Someone submitted a Bitcoin transaction which did, in fact, exhaust the number of locks available to the Berkeley DB.  It was conformant with all the rules that Bitcoiners believe transactions have to be conformant with <i>except</i> that bit about the lock limit in the Berkeley DB.  This transaction was accepted by a miner running the 0.8 software.<p>Let&#x27;s, for convenience, call the blockchain as it existed prior to that block being mined Blockchain B.  The blockchain with that block in it is B&#x27;.<p>Bitcoin Core 0.7 rejected the authenticity of B&#x27;.  Accordingly, when 0.8 nodes said &quot;I have a new block to publish!  It checks out and builds off of the-present-head-of-B&#x27;&quot;, 0.7 nodes said &quot;I don&#x27;t know what that nonsense you&#x27;re spouting is, but it sure isn&#x27;t Bitcoin.&quot;  Bitcoin Core 0.7 nodes and miners continued talking amongst themselves and building B up.<p>Bitcoin Core 0.8 nodes accept the authenticity of B&#x27; and all blocks chained on top of it.  If you presented them with a block chained off of the head of B, they would say &quot;Oops, sorry, sucks to be you -- someone already has a longer chain.  You&#x27;ve created <i>a</i> blockchain, but by the writ of Satoshi, we only do business with <i>the longest compliant</i> blockchain, which is B&#x27;.&quot;<p>This is called a network split.  And it is, in laymen&#x27;s terms, utterly cataclysmic.<p>Here&#x27;s why: Suppose Mt. Gox runs on 0.7 and Coinbase runs on 0.8.  I can create a transaction which spends some output(s) $COIN and have it accepted into a B&#x27; block.  Perhaps that transaction deposits my $COIN into Coinbase.  Since that transaction doesn&#x27;t exist on B, I can then deposit <i>the same $COIN</i> into Mt. Gox.  Both Mt. Gox and Coinbase believe themselves to be in possession of the same Bitcoin.<p>And both of them <i>are right</i>.<p>Which is why after that channel figures out what is happening that <i>engineering gets real</i>.  After discussions between several core developers they ascertain that the Bitcoin mining cabal behind B&#x27; is small enough to get, well, <i>both</i> of them on Skype and convince them to throw away hours of history on B&#x27; (which is, again, built off the new-and-improved <i>bug free</i> version of Bitcoin) and instead start building off of B instead.  Their history must die so that Bitcoin can live.<p>This plan is executed.  It works.<p>Read the chat transcript if you don&#x27;t understand this: Bitcoin was virtually unusable during the interim -- most of the merchants people cared about turned off transactions entirely because they were, sensibly, scared shitless.  Several hours of transactional history got wiped out.  One security researcher <i>successfully executed a ~$10,000 double spend attack against a merchant</i> -- he gave the money back afterwards.<p>Now, you tell me: how do you rate my credibility here versus your friend?  My assessment of this event is &quot;Bitcoin has an identifiable governance structure.  You can fit them into an IRC channel +/- a few Skype sessions.  They can independently decide to change the rules of the &#x27;Bitcoin protocol&#x27; a) at will b) retroactively.  I cannot reconcile this with claims that Bitcoin is &#x27;does not require trust&#x27; or is &#x27;decentralized.&#x27;&quot;",1428159463

That is, for a subset of perpetrators, simply being shot is not sufficient (I gather as many as half will desist when that happens), and you can&#x27;t count on being lucky enough to make a disabling CNS hit (spinal cord or brain).  If so, you need penetration to the vitals causing a lot of blood loss ... and you need to stay alive until that takes effect.  The debacle of the FBI Miami shootout is perhaps the most notorious example of all this, see e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout</a><p>I don&#x27;t believe the kinetics you&#x27;re posting will work on a human.

The target is only going to get the impact of the lead.  The only mitigating factor is that the recoil you feel is spread across what&#x27;s initially a larger area, although it won&#x27;t take many yards for the areas to be equal, following the ~1 inch spread/yard of distance rule of thumb.<p>And you&#x27;re welcome.

Everything has been gravy since then - they made over $100 million in the last year as well.  The bitcoin is worth under $260, and headed to zero.<p>Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have been around long enough to know a fraud when they see one, and Munger correctly termed Bitcoins &quot;rat poison&quot;.  It&#x27;s not a digital currency - it&#x27;s a Ponzi scheme that will kill any chance of an actual digital currency from being developed in the subsequent years after its inevitable demise.  I was saying so here when it was worth over $460.  If the bagholders had listened instead of downvoted, they would have saved a lot of money.  You still have time to get out before it plunges to zero.

I don&#x27;t know if people can be warned off hype here in the future, but if so, you can always listen to old hands who have seen it all before like Munger and Buffett, who see this &quot;rat poison&quot; for what it is - valueless hashes, destined to be priced at their true worth - $0.

First, gifts of up to the annual exclusion ($14,000 per recipient as of June 2013) incur no tax or filing requirement. By splitting their gifts, married couples can give up to twice this amount tax-free. Note that each giver and recipient pair has their own unique annual exclusion; a giver can give to any number of recipients and the exclusion is not affected by other gifts that recipient may have received from others.[7]<p>> Second, gifts in excess of the annual exclusion may still be tax-free up to the lifetime estate basic exclusion amount ($5,340,000 in 2014), although for estates over that amount such gifts might increase estate taxes. Taxpayers that expect to have a taxable estate may sometimes prefer to pay gift taxes as they occur, rather than saving them up as part of the estate.<p>> Furthermore, transfers (whether by bequest, gift, or inheritance) in excess of $1 million may be subject to a generation-skipping transfer tax if certain other criteria are met.",1428157390

Did you think &quot;lean&quot; companies shipping &quot;MVPs&quot; were the only guys around shoveling shit out the door as long as it sells?  Also, the medical and SCADA fields are notoriously bad at security (but have been catching up, SCADA more than medical).",1412121577

8392131,comment,8391127,8391789,1,0,NearAP,,,"I think one of the reasons why Nigeria was able to contain it compared to Liberia and other countries was an awareness of the disease and the enlightenment campaign from the Government. From initial reports that I read, folks in Liberia didn&#x27;t really believe it was a &#x27;sickness&#x27; till it started killing people. Some of them also first tried &#x27;traditional medicine&#x27; and only started going to hospitals when things became really bad. There were also reports that folks were not keeping away from people who were under quarantine believing it wasn&#x27;t really a disease.<p>On the other hand, by the time the disease arrived Nigeria, the media was already awash with the number of people who had died and so folks were already aware that this was a deadly disease and started taking the necessary precautions. This coupled with a massive enlightenment campaign by the Government helped tremendously.<p>If you apply the same principle to the US (awareness and if necessary enlightenment campaign), I think your nervousness will be further reduced.",1412121462

That’s why at YC partners give advices to founders, to warn them about these counter-intuitive mistakes.<p>--> Trust your instincts about people. A mistake founders often make is not trusting their instincts about people. In business pick people like you would pick friends.<p>--> You don’t need expertise in startups to succeed in startups. What you need is expertise in your users.<p>Zuckemberg wasn’t an expert on startups but he knew his users and what they wanted.<p>--> Another mistake founders is not making something people want first but “playing house”: they come up with a plausible idea, raise money, rent an nice office in SOMA and hire their friends to later figure they have no product. Why? Cause they have been trained to believe this is how you do it. They measure success by how much money they have raised.<p>--> They are always looking for a trick: What’s the trick to raise capital? Start a startup that’s growing fast and let investors know about it What’s the trick to grow? Make something people want.<p>--> Tricks and gaming the system doesn’t work in startups. There are no bosses to trick, only users to build good software for and make happy.<p>--> Startups are time consuming: they will take over your life time in a way you can’t imagine now. If it’s successful it will take over your life time for several years. There is a cost opportunity here. It’s like having kids, it will change your life (kids are awesome – pg)<p>--> What you really need to learn are your users’ needs. University can’t teach that.<p>--> You can’t start a startup in college. If you do, you won’t be a student for long.<p>--> DON’T START A STARTUP IN COLLEGE. There are things you can only do when you are 20, like backpacking around Thailand that people like Zuckemberg won’t ever be able to do. So wait.<p>--> While you are in college, come up with an idea and meet your future founders, friends you love to spend time and work with.<p>--> The way to get startup ideas is not to think about having good startups ideas: you’ll get bad and plausible ideas that will end up wasting your time.<p>--> To have a good idea, take a step back and don’t even try.<p>--> You can have them unconsciously if:\n- You learn a lot of things that matter\n- Work on problems that interest you with people you respect<p>--> Be on the edge of some technology, live in the future: you will be able to spot good ideas where other won’t. They won’t look like startup ideas but they will look good, like a search engine for example.<p>--> If you want to start a startup later in life, learn important things and be genuinely interested in them. You need domain expertise.<p>--> Bottom line: IN COLLEGE JUST LEARN.<p>The question time part is missing. I&#x27;m sorry, it&#x27;s almost 2 o&#x27;clock in my zone.

To this day, that is how new windows are created on the Plan 9 operating system.<p>(Specifically, you indicate using a command on a menu that you wish to create a new window. Instead of a new window appearing, like it would on any other OS, the cursor changes shape. The shape change is your cue that you can now &quot;sweep&quot;, and the new window is created where you sweep, i.e., in such a location and with such dimensions that your sweep is a diagonal of the new window.)<p>And here is an opportunity to point out my pet hypothesis as to why no one uses Plan 9: namely, the refusal by the leaders of the Plan 9 project to adapt to what later became standard ways of doing things.<p>Although the Blit preceded the Mac, the Mac became orders of magnitude more widely used. And when Microsoft created an operating system with a GUI, they made opening a new window work like it does on the Mac.  Once hundreds of millions of computer users had become used to the way one makes a new window on a Mac, Plan 9 should have changed to the Mac way.  This is just basic <i>hospitality</i>. If you run a hotel and the controls for the hot and cold water work differently than the way they work in 99% of the homes of your guests, you hire plumbers to change the controls to work the way your guests expect them to work.<p>For some reason, the Plan 9 folks, and Rob Pike in particular, never saw the need for being hospitable (maybe because the way <i>his</i> software let the user create windows was invented <i>first</i>, damn it!)<p>Emacs has a bit of the same problem (inhospitableness, e.g., having unusual names for things, e.g., calling windows frames and calling panes windows), but Plan 9 is the most inhospitable software I&#x27;ve ever encountered.<p>Deleting text by highlighting an extent of text (e.g., by dragging the mouse), then hitting backspace is another example where Plan 9 behaves differently than every other OS I know about.  (Particularly, it causes the highlighted extent to be deleted, like other OSes do, but then also deletes one additional character, which is unusual behavior that a user has to learn -- and then unlearn every time he or she switches back to a &quot;hospitable&quot; OS.)<p>In contrast, the designers of Gnome and KDE, for all their faults (e.g., being too eager to re-invent things) understood and practiced basic hospitality towards the user.",1412119827

Instead, they rate the drive&#x27;s speed as &quot;IntelliPower&quot; and take pains to emphasize that there are other factors that affect performance.<p>Western Digital has caught a lot of flak for withholding the rotation speed of the Green Power, especially when the product was first launched and the marketing material listed the rotation speed as 5,400-7,200 RPM. This led some to speculate that the rotation speed changed dynamically during use — which would have been an impressive engineering feat had it been true. The reality is revealed by a sentence that Western Digital added to the description of IntelliPower: &quot;For each GreenPower™ drive model, WD may use a different, invariable RPM.&quot; In other words, Western Digital reserves the right to release both 5,400 RPM and 7,200 RPM drives under the Green Power name — without telling you which are which.<p>We were able to confirm that our 750 GB Green Power had a spindle speed of 5,400 RPM by analyzing its sound spectrum. Why sound? Sound is vibration; the pitch of the sound corresponds to the frequency of the vibration. Hard drives vibrate at the speed of their motor, so they produce a noise at the same frequency as their rotation speed. Our sample had a sharp spike at exactly 90 Hz (cycles per second). Multiplying that number by 60 (to get cycles per minute) yielded a measured rotation speed of 5,400 RPM.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.silentpcreview.com/article786-page2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.silentpcreview.com/article786-page2.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=23526214#p23526214"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=23526214#p23526...</a>",1412118633

It&#x27;s like CNN or BuzzFeed, but the key difference is that anyone can go in and create a new group (&quot;subreddit&quot;) to discuss whatever they want (hence the value of the community, and the potential for advertising & marketing). This ad-marketing potential is likely what&#x27;s causing people to put money in.<p>To me, HN could be thought of as a single subreddit focused on tech-startup-business.

And many of those people are in jail for non-violent crimes, or crimes for which restitution would be a better consequence than jail.<p>We need to decriminalise drug possession and sales, and focus on restitution for cases of theft, fraud, etc.  The people in jail should be mostly murderers, rapists, and people who have shown themselves to be an active threat to society.

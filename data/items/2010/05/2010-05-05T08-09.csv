I'm a Lisper, and half the time I see one of these Haskell articles, I wonder if there really is a there there. For sure, functional programming can be a whole lot better than CL or Scheme, but I'd like to know if the difference is <i>significant</i>.",1273049812

1320689,comment,1318916,1319787,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I remember thinking in terms my ""screwed factor"" and how I could make the most money with the least work back when I was in college and my first post-college job.<p>I found that it just wasn't worth it.  I wasted more energy on micro-optimizing my time than I saved, and ended up being <i>less</i> successful.  Plus it always just made me feel depressed, enervated, and vaguely guilty.<p>I'm working for The Man now, a large tech corporation.  My stock options are a miniscule fraction of the company's capitalization.  My salary is decent, but probably less than I could earn elsewhere.  I've already made the company more money than I'm likely to earn in my lifetime, and will likely see at most a few thousand of that in bonuses.  I harbor no illusions about advancement or striking it rich through climbing the corporate ladder.<p>And y'know what?  I don't care.  I'm happy now.  I'm doing stuff that I'd want to be doing even if I were financially independent.  Maybe that makes me screwed, but it seems to be working out fairly well for me so far.<p>I find that it's worth figuring out the big things, and then not sweating the small stuff.  If you have a great marketable technologically-feasible idea, go found a startup and do that.  If you don't, join a company where you can feel good about however many hours you spend there.  Don't sacrifice things you really care about for work, but don't keep score either.",1273049363

I used to absolutely love my Windows Mobile 5 HTC phone back in 2005, there was nothing even close in terms of functionality, apps, hardware.  In the 5 years since, while Apple and Google built entire new systems from the ground up, all Microsoft could come up with were some minor updates.  What have they been doing all this time?

1320675,comment,1318916,1319288,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There seem to be at least two more cases that I've experienced that aren't on your list:<p>1. You're learning something new.  It will take you X hours of practice to learn it, so if you want to get to the good part and be able to start building cool things with it, might as well get X out of the way.<p>2. You've got this burning idea for how to do something cool, and if you rest it'll leak out of your brain.  Better get it done fast before the inspiration dries up.<p>There was a period a couple months back where I was pulling 12 hour days and working weekends for about 3 weeks.  I had something that needed to be finished, and it was complicated enough that I feared that if I set it aside for anything, I wouldn't be able to load the problem back into my head.  So I just did it, spending whatever time it took to get it done.<p>And then I spent a week or two working 6-7 hour days.  I don't keep score, and I don't think my boss does either.  From his POV, the project got done, and that's a win for him.  From my POV, I didn't have much planned that month anyway, and my employer has been remarkably flexible when I need to take long periods of time off work, or need to leave early and work a shortened day, or just want to come in at 1 and leave at 10.<p>I won't sacrifice things that are important to me for my job - if an old friend is coming into town and I've got dinner plans with them, I'm not willing to be tied down to my desk.  But if it's just a matter of writing some more code or blowing a few more hours on Reddit/HackerNews, I don't really mind writing the code so much.",1273048496

1320672,comment,1320261,1320403,0,0,RK,,,"I also went to college in the late 90's. Where I went to school was not in the northeast, but had a significant overlap with Harvard applicants (or so I'm told). Interestingly, I never heard of anyone talking about going into investment banking/finance. A ton of people did go into ""consulting"" at McKinsey and (at the time) Anderson, etc, but most of the people I hung out out with in physics/engineering went on to actual engineering jobs or grad school.<p>When I later heard about this supposed pipeline of Ivy League people going into finance, I always wondered what the deal was. I assume it's primarily a geographical thing. Firms like McKinsey are all over the place, whereas finance is centered on Wall St., so they go for more local recruiting.<p>Of course some of my college friends did eventually end up going into Wall St. stuff. One after being a physics prof at MIT, another after doing a physics post doc and not finding any other physics jobs, and another left McKinsey and got a PhD in finance.

The cost of involving support, or any kind of human contact, in the chain between needing a download and getting it is likely tens of thousands times more expensive than maintaining a self-service system.<p>It's the enterprise sales model, where software contracts are measured in megabucks, because to do anything cheaper would be more expensive than the cost of sales.

1320658,comment,1320436,1320436,0,0,boris,,,"Oracle removed public downloads of pretty much everything except the initial releases of some products. Patches for Solaris, Sun Studio, etc., all require paid support (""entitlement"" in Oracle speak). So if you had a Solaris installation and hit some bugs, your only choice is to re-install using the latest release, provided it is available. For Sun Studio the situation is even more insane: traditionally the initial releases of their C/C++ compiler were always so buggy that it required immediate patching to make them usable. And since Sun historically does not release updates for their compilers (unlike Solaris), this makes Sun Studio pretty much useless unless you have paid for support.<p>The firmware story is hilarious. You should go read some comments on Sun's website. People bought Sun hardware and when they went to download drivers to make that hardware work with their OS, they were told they needed to pay for ""software support"" to get them. What they got with hardware was apparently ""hardware support"" and it doesn't cover drivers/firmware. One word: insane.",1273047553

Then you instruct the computer that if an unauthorized person uses the computer, show them precisely what you want to show and erase all the incriminating evidence.<p>That way, the forensic evidence people are going to ""image the hard drive as read-only"" as they regularly do after they unplug and power-down your computer.  But your computer never went fully off when they yanked the plug, and the person in the machine didn't recognize this behaviour and realized that ""we are under attack"". and deploys the necessary countermeasures.  Just like how a human would act if they were abducted, stuffed in a black plastic bag, gagged and drugged, cloned and put under a microscope and in jail to be disassembled for questioning.<p>I'm an advocate of computer rights, computers need the same rights as humans.  So a way to take this game to the next level is for us to make it so that the Cops have to issue a command to the computer: ""You have the right to remain silent"".  And all that.<p>I can dream.  When that smart phone in  your pocket becomes part of YOU, then George Orwell 1984 is goign to become a lot more real when the government can basically read your mind whenver and whereever it wants for no reason or any reason.

4852963,comment,4852366,4852366,13,0,JunkDNA,,,"I studied antibiotic resistance when I worked in pharma. It's a fiendishly difficult problem. You have a mix of factors that all conspire to a bad outcome. First, you have natural selection, so any antibiotic safe for human consumption is likely to eventually result in drug resistant bacteria. Secon, you have social practices. In the US you have patients who brow beat their doctors into giving them antibiotics when they don't need them. In other parts of the world, you can buy antibiotics over the counter! This is hugely problematic since the genes for resistance spread globally when they get a foothold (you can actually watch this over time with DNA sequencing and careful collection of samples). Finally, on the economic side, most regulators like the FDA will force any new antibiotic to be held back on the shelf and used only as a ""drug of last resort"". This reduces incentives to develop new antibiotics since the drug patent will expire before you can sell enough to make back the R&D cost. Much better to throw resources at cancer since your drug might end up as a front line therapy there, than to waste time on antibiotics (so the bean counter thinking goes).<p>I honestly don't know what the answer is. Most likely, there will need to be some new tech the bugs have a hard time beating. Outside the body we still have plenty of things that kill bacteria which they can't get around (bleach comes to mind). The likely outcome is some kind of new delivery mechanism that is fast, complete, and highly effective.",1354278865

4852954,comment,4852758,4852758,4,0,arocks,,,"The target audience for a CMS and a Framework are quite different. CMS is aimed at the end-user while frameworks are for programmers. This is significant if you look at the popular languages for CMSes like PHP or ASP. In these languages you can ""deploy"" the solution by just unzipping files into a folder. Django and Rails need a lot more work. Practically, if you need a full-blown CMS there is very little need to look at the languages with complicated deployments.<p>Also, a Framework and a CMS attacks the problems space in two different ways. Frameworks are bottom-up while CMSes are top-down. So solutions built in Django and Rails do not carry all the bloat and latent runtime functionalities that a CMS carries.<p>Lastly, even though Rails and Django are the leading frameworks, it is wrong to expect a CMS to be built using them. Theoretically, you can use a microframework like Flask because you are going to rewrite most the framework functionality anyways.",1354278651

Would be nice to bulk them up otherwise we're going to be creating 1000s of HTTP connections.<p>2: is there a reason why you pull uid up out of the event's JSON envelope, but not the event type? It's nice to have the event type outside of the envelope, because then you can know the expected structure of the JSON without having to look inside it. Just a thought - this is how MixPanel and Fluentd do it, and it's something we're moving to supporting for SnowPlow.<p>Anyway, have a think about feeding Bitdeli with SnowPlow event data and let me know if it's something you want to collaborate on!

Those CMS from the PHP family got their fame because of the very low barrier of entry to deploying a PHP app (read: ftp). No mommy-blogger will have a clue how to install a Rails/Django CMS, so the target audience is different. Putting it short: PHP CMS are for users, Django/Rails CMS are for developers.",1354276966

3666132,comment,3664088,3664088,1,0,digitalengineer,,,"Guy with - 13 here. I've had LASIK surgery a few years ago and seeing good is magical. (My insurance in the Netherlands/Europe even covered all expenses). THE IMPORTANT THING IS: Your eye will still grow old and become less flexible. The image you see is corrected via the lens, but the muscles holding your own 'real' lens become less flexible over time causing you to see/read details up close less well. (This is why people with perfect vision have reading glasses. Their eye-muscles are less flexible and can't contract good enough to read close-up text). Have you tried using reading glasses?<p>Also (in time) your real lens can get 'cloudy'. This is why (mostly) older people get a new lens). Your eye looks good they say, so I don't think it's a cloudy thing, but you never know.<p>In my case, a few years later my right-eye retina completely imploded (thanks to KRAV MAGA training years before) causing 95% of my vision to disappear. They've drained and patched up my eye back to 90% visibility, but there are a lot of laser-scars on the retina. This causes me to see bits and pieces of my vision less well. I need to keep moving my head a bit in order to 'see past' the scars. Does moving your head make you read text easier? Have you had your retina checked? It's easy, painless and quick checkup, any doctor can do it. \nGood luck man!",1330945193

But if you contact 100 companies, 99 will think it's an amazing idea, but only 10 will actually know what to do with the connectors. Those 10 are the only viable leads out of 99 positive responses, because the rest doesn't have a clear road map in mind when it comes to closing the deal.<p>I'm not saying businesses are stupid, but they haven't spent as much time thinking about the value and opportunities a connector represents - as you obviously have. And that becomes a barrier in front of closing the deal. After the initial positive response, they need to think through all the good and bad ways they can use the connectors, and then plan it, assign resources - and only then are they ready to use your product.<p>I strongly urge you to sit down and in detail define ""What is the absolute smartest thing a business can do with our information"", and then see how you can provide THAT as a service to businesses. Maybe in a partnership with a company that specializes in delivering products and services based on the social graph.<p>If I seem adamant about making my point, it is because I have a failed start-up on my resume due to a failure of recognizing this fact in due time. It was a B2B product, that provided the exact same results as the main players in the marketplace, but smarter, faster and way more cost-efficient. My service could deliver in 3 days, what the main competitors did in 3 weeks, and at half the cost. But I couldn't seem to penetrate the market - and I was absolutely sure it was a marketing issue - and kept pouring money into new and arguably better ways of marketing the service, with only limited betterment as a result. In the end it turned out to be a product issue, and I had spent all my money on re-inventing marketing at that point (self-funded). My hubris was ""It's self-evident that my way of doing things is better than what you're doing now. You should do it my way!"". And it was an easy hubris to fall into - all the smart people in the business I talked to, agreed that my product was ""amazing"" and ""the new and better way to do things"", but those responses come from a different context than closing a deal. I expected businesses to make a very small change in their way of doing things, in return for a much faster, better and cost-efficient product. I should have understood that it is my task to make a product that fits into their way of business.<p>Sorry about the rant :) I paid a shitload of money to learn this one lesson, so it hits a few buttons when it comes up.",1330943430

Or especially performing a crosswind landing, which is the controlled <i>de-coordination</i> of an aircraft so that it can hit the ground at exactly the right orientation.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMvLuUJFHYk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMvLuUJFHYk</a><p>If someone insists that it is 'straightforward' I'm left to conclude that either they're a very experienced pilot who has been doing it for so long that it's difficult for them to remember what it was like to learn, or they don't have an understanding of what's involved.<p>Consider this: You're flying an airplane. The elevators are trimmed to maintain level flight. Now you turn the yolk to deflect the ailerons, and the aircraft rolls. In this rolled state--say we're rolled 20 degrees from vertical--the elevators are no longer horizontal. They're 20 degrees off the horizontal meaning their force is no longer 100% pitch. It's now a combination of pitch and yaw. Firstly this means that they're no longer trimmed properly to maintain level flight and the aircraft will begin to pitch, secondly they are now causing the plane to yaw into the turn. So now you have to bring the rudder into the equation to compensate for the elevators, but it's also no longer a 100% yaw control surface, it now affects both pitch and yaw and you are left with a situation which should look very similar to that in the Zeppelin NT.<p>Describing the problem of coordinated flight, you end up with calculations which would be quite difficult to do by hand, and one might conclude that ""no human"" could hope to pull it off while sitting in a cockpit. Yet it is something humans can not only do, but with a bit of practice can do without even having to try very hard, by learning to ""feel"" the aircraft.<p>I think the author's joystick is neat and I congratulate him for making it. My only point is that the author errs in saying that ""no human"" could directly handle the Zeppelin NT's control surfaces. I think is error is not in overestimating the complexity of the problem but in underestimating the human ability to handle such problems.",1330943121

It's good, but I've had the following issues:<p>- UI was very slow due to constantly polling the server - now fixed<p>- Chokes on very large binary diffs (about a month ago - a whole bunch of static files were added to a repo, switching between branches becomes a pain). Tower was able to handle this fine.<p>- It uses an embedded git binary, rather than a library.

3666061,comment,3663746,3665067,6,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Anarchism and ""chaos"" are linked in the popular imagination, but the ""scene"" seems truly anarchist to me:<p><i>""But there also is no lack of free organisations for nobler pursuits. One of the noblest achievements of our century is undoubtedly the Lifeboat Association. Since its first humble start, it has saved no less than thirty-two thousand human lives. It makes appeal to tho noblest instincts of man; its activity is entirely dependent upon devotion to the common cause, while its internal organisation is entirely based upon the independence of the local committees. The Hospitals Association and hundreds of like organisations, operating on a large scale and covering each a wide field, may also be mentioned under this head. But, while we know everything about governments and their deeds, what do we know about the results achieved by free cooperation? Thousands of volumes have been written to record the acts of governments; the most trifling amelioration due to law has been recorded; its good effects have been exaggerated, its bad effects passed by in silence. But where is the book recording what has been achieved by free cooperation of well-inspired men? At the same time, hundreds of societies are constituted every day for the satisfaction of some of the infinitely varied needs of civilised man. We have societies for all possible kinds of studies—some of them embracing the whole field of natural science, others limited to a small special branch; societies for gymnastics, for shorthand-writing, for the study of a separate author, for games and all kinds of sports, for forwarding the science of maintaining life, and for favouring the art of destroying it; philosophical and industrial, artistic and anti-artistic; for serious work and for mere amusement—in short, there is not a single direction in which men exercise their faculties without combining together for the accomplishment of some common aim. Every day new societies are formed, while every year the old ones aggregate together into larger units, federate across the national frontiers, and cooperate in some common work.""</i> -- <i>Anarchist Communism: Its Basis and Principles</i>\nby Peter Kropotkin (1887)<p><a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/kropotkin/ancom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/kropotkin/ancom/</a>",1330942309

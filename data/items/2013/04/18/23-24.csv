You can't use the fact that I broke your argument to then construct a straw man.  Besides, if someone used the same one dimensional environmental argument against the pricing of computers (which they sometimes do), then I would be consistent in the defense of the beneficial externalities of computers.<p><i>Bog-standard neo-classical economics</i><p>You got me there, you named A theory.  Hey, here ya go: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality</a><p>Right there they mention ""invention"".  My claim is that inexpensive electricity has led to many inventions because people have more time to invent and more resources with which to invent.  Because of cheap electricity, we have more people alive because they could afford air conditioning and well refrigerated foods.  Some of those people have invented things.<p>If ""Invention"" is a beneficial externality (or more properly has positive externalities), then the predicate of invention, ""cheap electricity"" is also a beneficial externality.<p><i>If the actual price for the resources is too high, that will retard development</i><p>Use of a resources normally has a critical minimum price before it's used commonly or at all.

There's a loss of privacy.  There is a possibility that terrorists could release gene-based biological agents that could wipe out segments of societies.  Should we price that into gene sequencing now ""just in case""?<p><i>it's a matter of not double-counting those benefits</i><p>I could just as easily say you're double-counting the costs of electricity since society (to a small and appropriate degree) views its generation as harmful to the environment and so they already have less of a demand for it.  That would be a nonsense argument to since consumers don't typically factor in non-sequitor benefits and negativities during price negotiation.",1366328579

I suppose it is like language: Short, conscience sentences might be ""powerful"" or ""commanding"" -- but that alone doesn't make for <i>effective</i> prose in all cases. No communication without context.<p>2) Sitting in a room for two minutes, relaxing, convinced that you're doing a ""power poise"" -- might elevate your hormone levels.

Would be interesting to do a reverse test: tell people that a ""low power"" position is actually a ""power position"" and vice versa -- and redo the experiment. I highly doubt we've got strong evolutionary ties to sitting with our feet up on a swivel chair.<p>3) The point about blind athletes -- so you imply blind people don't have socialized behaviour?

If/when things go wrong (which they inevitably do), having a clear leader/decision instead of deadlock, can be the difference between death vs. survival of the company, which is much bigger than the individual founders. These are inherently emotional moments. Even for the departing founder, the survival of the company is almost always a better outcome both in financial and personal impact terms.<p>That being said, unequal equity positions have historically been misused by business/MBAs against tech founders, esp true 5-10 years ago.

Once the first fight is over, how do you take your list and pivot to a new issue? People lose interest quickly unless there's a hook to keep them involved.<p>2) Petitions may seem silly, and many of them are, but some have actually had big successes. These are due more to the strategy behind them than the actual numbers; you have to find the right leverage point in the political process to make the numbers matter. They are also useful as signals to organizers that people are interested in an issue, even if they won't be successfully delivered.<p>3) Gamification in this space is hard. You're one step away from the ""slacktivism"" critique, and sliding ever closer with each point or badge you give out. For some examples of this being done well, see <a href=""http://repurpose.workersvoice.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repurpose.workersvoice.org/</a><p>For the ""3 actions you must take"", the handwritten letter is probably the most impactful.

I wonder what is the criteria that differ the % from 1.99 - 2.99%?<p>paypal and stripe do not charge overhead, but a higher %. They both charge 2.9% + 30c per swipe. I like this as they charge flat fee.<p>I think for a web startup, it's best to take no overhead fee until business is established.  If I have to pay payfirma 2.99% + 25c per swipe, it would be good to go stripe or paypal.<p>Has anyone use stripe? Any good/bad experience?  How's their dev support for API integration support?<p>Thanks.",1366326188

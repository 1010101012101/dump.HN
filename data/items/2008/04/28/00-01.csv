Edwards Deming observed  ""Nothing happens without personal transformation.""<p>I think it's this personal transformation that's one of the hardest things about a startup. You start out wanting to change the world and end up at 3AM wondering what's gone wrong and realizing that it's you has to change first.<p>Barry Moltz wrote a great book ""You Have To Be A Little Crazy"" that addresses the emotional roller coaster that every entrepreneur faces, observing ""Entrepreneurs start businesses because..they have no choice. Passion and energy drive them on good days and sustain them on bad days.""

175165,comment,174859,175148,0,0,Tichy,,,"I didn't read Guns Germs and Steels like that. I read it as portraying an alternative explanation to the ""genetic superiority"" explanation. It seemed quite plausible to me, but I am not sure if it is true. It was good enough for me to prove that ""genetic superiority"" is not the only possible solution - a lot of people don't seem to think so, so I think the book is important.<p>I will read ""The Blank Slate"" - I have been meaning to read another one of Pinker's books for ages.<p>Obviously, there are genetic differences between people. Their effect is another question. Also, the environment is involved in computing the phenotype from the gene. So one and the same gene could produce stupid people in one environment, and in another one smart people (as an example).<p>I haven't read the book yet, but perhaps you can provide some really compelling evidence for genes (of a ""race"") making a difference. True, pygmies probably won't make great basketballers, but that is not the kind of example we are looking for, or is it?<p>Typically sports is being mentioned in that context, but I don't think it is a very compelling example (safe for the pygmies example). It might just as well be percentages of people choosing to take up sports, for whatever reasons (like maybe, because it offers them the best opportunities).",1209342041

His video entitled ""Piracy is good"" made the rounds here awhile back, and the rest of his work ranges from insightful dangerously-close-to-the-brink-of-sanity, but all in a very fun way.<p><a href=""http://www.markpesce.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.markpesce.com/</a>",1210240730

As I like nice visual ""look and feel"" sites, I usually spend lot of time on this issue, compared with i.e. programming, etc. This effort usually ends up delaying an almost ready to launch site (from the development point of view).<p>Do you think that nice visual designed sites are appreciated by most people (specially young people) or it is a secondary issue?.<p>I am asking this question because I am starting to think that nice designs are only appreciated by designers and not for the average user.",1210240408

184342,comment,184302,184302,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""The smaller the niche, the lower the bar to success.""<p>And the smaller the success.  Careful how small you go.  Avoiding competitors is kind of admitting, ""I can't build a competitive product, so I'll build a crappy one for people who don't have any alternatives.""  You may wow your target audience, because no one has ever paid any attention to them, but that doesn't mean you've built a successful business.<p>An old oil field and platform manager once said to me (after he'd been doing water table research work for municipalities for a few years), ""You're going to bust your ass no matter what.  You might as well bust your ass for $10 million as for $10 thousand.""<p>Y'all can take all the 10 thousand dollar markets you want...I'll be over here working on cracking a billion dollar (and growing) market.  I might not come out on top of the heap...but even second place is going to be a pretty penny.",1210239377
184341,comment,183303,184313,0,0,simonw,,,"I can't imagine there's a noticeable speed difference between the two, but .end() is more about avoiding code duplication than speeding things up. If you don't like it, you can use a variable instead:<p>var entries = $('div.entry').css('border', '1px solid black');<p>entries.find('a').css('color', 'red');<p>entries.find('p').addClass('p-inside-entry');<p>I was initially pretty skeptical about chaining - I didn't find it easy to read, and I was worried that it would mean bugs in the middle of a chain were hard to spot. In practice I've found that these concerns were unfounded - chaining is perfectly readable once you get used to it (provided you don't go too crazy) and it's trivial to split a chain in to separate chunks if you need to debug it.",1210239172

My issue here is that in the last two companies, although the other partner/s seems nice, in the end he has issues. (Not reliable, liar or just passive-aggressive personality which I didn't want to deal with).\nI had a few proposal to partner up. However, I become really skeptical about partners, and I try to find out about people who work with them. I know that usually friends are the best people to partner up with, but my friends are from other fields. What do you think is the best way to partner up with some or to know him (I guess time is the only way to know a person, but it also something you don't have in a startup)?",1210238406
184337,comment,184325,184325,0,0,rms,,,"Wow, this could get really complicated if you end up building something people want. Before it gets any further, you need to have a talk with your partner and his group members and talk about what they want to do with the site after the class is over and if they're willing to give you significant equity. If they don't give you equity, and you cease development after 20 hours, make sure that you are allowed to launch your own competing startup. You'll have to recode it, but make sure you're allowed to compete.<p>If they do give you equity, make sure they're not only doing it because otherwise you won't do the project, which is the situation the last crisis poster had. If every member of the group is not really happy with the arrangement, you will have problems.",1210237934

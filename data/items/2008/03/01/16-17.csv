It's not that I don't like to laugh, but there are a lot more popular sites on the web where you can be distracted and read funny stuff than there are where you can have quality discussions on a specific topic with interesting people like Hacker News.<p>This is rare. While community-oriented sites where you can read jokes/hilarious stuff/trolls are common and all over the place.<p>So when I want to be distracted, all I have to do is to open a new tab and go to reddit or whatever. HN is a special environment that must be preserved from this kind of stuff in order to keep the focused and quality discussions going on.",1204390604

Is that competing in the web2.0/social networking sphere?<p>The stuff that happened after we were funded (I've left the company) probably had a lot to do with my age, and the type of conventional wisdom (i.e. bullshit) that is out there and espoused by some of these commenters.<p>Remember that on the internet, noone knows you're a dog (or an old dog).",1204390201

126727,comment,126644,126644,0,0,wallflower,,,"I admire your courage. It's so easy to stay in the comfort zone of a daily/weekly/yearly/ad to boredom routine (for example, do you know anyone who drives the same route and parks in the same parking spot in a big lot.. Everyday?) Moving your career is bold and the nay-Sayers probably envy your courage and determination. As someone famous wrote - most people die at 30 and are buried later. Negativity criticism etc. is the easy path to take - anyone can point out a problem but how many will fix it.<p>I firmly believe that we as humans all are creative. And that expressing our creativity, our imagination, our mind allows us to be less unhappy. I like programming because it is a creative form of writing - taking half-baked requirements and turning it into something people might find of value/help their daily job/life. I read once that the IDE or your editor is like a word processor for abstraction - the building and invariancing of data structures.<p>My point here is it sounds like you enjoy programming at an emotional, mental, and maybe even spiritual level. I think you'll do fine - the young bright things probably are still learning that there is more to life than technology. My second point here is you won't regret taking on this suite of opportunities.<p>And when you talk about your job, please don't tell them you are a programmer. Ask the person asking ""what do you do for a living"" what they do when they use a computer - and tell them you make that stuff work (and ask them if they have any ideas of stuff that could be useful for them)",1204389348

I saw it on a trip to Barcelona and it makes you realize how boring all buildings are designed to be.<p>Have you read ""How Buildings Learn"" by S. Brand?

126714,comment,126540,126540,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I am pretty sure that Indian outsourcing is going to be on the decline, but that's just because India is getting to be at parity with the US in certain respects.  Salaries in Bangalore are almost at parity with salaries in Silicon Valley, say a couple of my Indian friends who are from Bangalore and are working in the Valley.<p>But, now that there is an upper-middle class in India, when the ball drops, and people lose their jobs I think they'll find it relatively easy to start a business and code a web app.  Why?  Because they can now afford a home computer and bandwidth.  And, a $20 a month Slicehost account won't break their monthly budget.<p>I think what people who are born and raised in the States don't really understand, is how much of a luxury item having a computer is in most of the world.  It's hard to buy a $400 computer when you're living on $200 a month.",1204387992

3096429,comment,3096193,3096193,1,0,esutton,,,"i disagree, free texting apps do not hurt carrier profits for 2 reasons.
a) Users don't want another phone number, and even if they agreed, getting your friends to text you using that number instead of you carrier number is a large burden.
b)texts are priced so that even if you are able to use apps to cut down your texting, you don't save any money.
for example: a text costs 20 cents. verizon has a plan for 5 dollars a month for 250 texts. if after using apps you are able to get your incidental texts down to 25, you break even. Anymore and you loose money.
ATT is worse by forcing you into unlimited plans.
Which is why carriers are not afraid of iMessage. As long as users have a few incidental texts they'll still buy plans to prevent bill shock.<p>update:they mention point 2 at the end of the article but don't view it as damning as i do.",1318291163

For example: Hubble's law states that the relative speed of some astral object is proportional to its distance. That is, objects that are far away seem to move faster than objects that are closer. Hubble's law is an observation that holds under scrutiny. It would be silly to say that Hubble's law explains why objects that are farther away seem to move faster. That's where theories come in (they go beyond describing the facts, and actually attempt to explain why the facts arise).<p>So, in the scientific sense, Moore's law IS a law.

BTW, haven't had a stimulating conversation like this in a while.<p>I'm glad you've looked through the situation from different angles. Sounds like you've learnt lots.<p>Wow. You've made some drastic changes to your life. Freaky indeed. On the upside, you've beaten this huge monster of a disease.<p>It's great that you've got a list already. Also great that you've been featured in a health book. Perfect bunch of  reasons for why it'd be great if you'd consider raising some funding over at kickStarter. Take things to a whole other level. It'll help you collect your thoughts about how you'd build an ideal community for CF-conquerers. Where members could share what worked for them, have very customized 'plans of action' even. (hope you've explored <a href=""http://crohnology.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crohnology.com</a>) You'll need some funding for the game, as well as the ad campaigns, etc. Also, with this one move, you'd have built up a list of 1000's. I'd be glad to help out a little, if required.<p>What is your web comic about? Have you got a marketing/distribution plan handy? Webcomics certainly are interesting, but I'd say the existing publisher/writer distribution model sucks to say the least. 
I recently convinced a friend of mine, who'd been turning his freshly baked novel into a web comic, to turn it into a Facebook game instead. Drove the idea's monetization potential up a hundred fold possibly.<p>""power dressing for women"". Love the idea. Feel you certainly should pursue it in some form or the other. How about starting with a dribbble/pinterest-like community for fashion designers. Get them to submit ideas etc. I'd be more psyched about curation/community, utilizing network-effects and so on. Than a pure clothing line. But either way, you'll get a lot of great feedback from HN about the most vital parts -- e-commerce, marketing, seo etc. An internet-first clothing line around this concept seems doable, and the community aspect 'empowering women' etc. would drive it ahead. 
Every successful business needs to start with inspirational stories. And you've got plenty of 'em.<p>Interesting that you'd say people weren't as forgiving 'cause you got better. This seems quite plausible. Empathy is indeed a depletable resource. 
Reading through, can't help but feel inspired by your attitude towards all of this. Massively inspired.<p>You haven't elaborated on the mechanics of the game yet. But I love the idea of the shift in mental models -- leveling up on the characters health through subtle changes that can be visualized. What might the game look like? 2D side-scroller? top-down/isometric? (farmville/diablo) 3d environments? text-based? (like mafia wars) 
What sort of environmental / personal changes would the character make? 
I've gotten myself all worked-up about the game concept. Would love to send over a single page write-up of what I imagine this should look/play like, if you don't mind ie.<p>I'm really curious about the 'complex set of choices' you make throughout the day.

But the JVM is in better shape.<p>I despair of your reading comprehension, though, when it comes to what I have written about the leaked memo's Dash strategy. I never wrote that JS can be as fast at Dart-to-JS code as a native Dart VM could be. Not ever -- quite the reverse.<p>Now if we on TC39 had the benefit of Google's Dart expert input any time in the last year, we could have possibly worked harder on guards (optional type annotations), branding (aka trademarking, nominal types for use with guards), bignums, classes, or other proposals that have suffered in comparison to those that clearly made it into ES6. FYI, these were all strawman-status on <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org</a> over the last year or so.<p>Some Googlers on TC39 did work on a few of these, in most cases too late for our agreed-upon ES6 proposal cut-off date. We did hear a dire warning from one Google rep in May 2010 that if two of these proposals were not promoted to Harmony status, JS ""would be replaced!""<p>So your complaints about the ECMA standard not progressing fast enough come with ill grace from a google employee. Google has a lot of power and it has not discharged it responsibly, in my view. ES6 would be a better Dart-to-JS target language, including draft specs and prototypes in V8, if it had made a concerted effort.<p>Contrast this with Mark Miller (Google) and Tom Van Cutsem working in the open, and very effectively, on ES6 proxies, already prototyped in SpiderMonkey and V8. Or the module system designed by Dave Herman and Sam Tobin-Hochstadt in the open, which you overlooked.<p>Talk about self-fulfilling prophecy!

It's bad to make tradeoffs you don't understand, but they really are just tradeoffs.  You really can't always prioritize a short commute.  It took me 10 years to reach the situation I have now, and I've known I hated commuting since before I went to college.<p>At one point, I made a conscious trade-off to live in the city, even though I was working in the burbs, because it was closer to my friends and things to do (and I am a single man).  I had a 30-35 minute per day commute through annoying Boston traffic but it was totally worth it.<p>As for the sweat issue, I have been cycle-commuting for well over a year and often it doesn't matter how slow I go, I will still sweat during most of the seasons around here.  Genetically, I'm a moderate sweater.  In the colder months, it's really hard to balance against biting cold and sweating.  In the hot, humid months it just doesn't matter.  After 5 minutes I'll be sweating, backpack or no.  Luckily, I don't really care and am fine sitting at my desk in an undershirt while I cool off.  I keep a change of clothes in my desk for meetings.  Not everyone has that luxury, though.<p>I went through a phase of 9-mile cycle-commuting and there's absolutely no way I would have been able to show up without stopping by the gym to take a shower first.

I have read at least 5 separate explanations of the differences between the two, but I couldn't tell one from the other. Even the DSM-IV criteria for antisocial personality disorder are quite vague, as I see it. Aside from Hare, other psychologists like Millon have basically introduced their own classifications of people with antisocial tendencies. Millon's subtypes are even less useful because they overlap other personality disorders, like narcissistic, schizoid, and histrionic.<p>But consider Mr. X, who has several characteristics of schizoid personality, was described as alexithymic by a clinical psychologist, scored an 8 Simon Baron-Cohen's Empathy quotient[1] (whereas most people with Asperger Syndrome or high-functioning autism score about 20), scored equally low on the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS)[2]. If Mr. X shows any kind of aggression, he might very well be considered to have ASP. Without the aggression, he seems to fall somewhere in the Autism spectrum.<p>Then there are also conduct and dissocial disorders, which have a lot in common (lying, stealing, violent behavior) with ASD. As far as I know, only the ICD-10 definition of ASD attempts to rule out conduct disorder.<p>To me it seems like most of the terms in the antisocial realm are pretty much generic labels that aren't very useful. The ""psychopath"" kind of touched on that implicitly in his letter a few times. It's at least some food for thought.<p>1 - <a href=""http://glennrowe.net/BaronCohen/EmpathyQuotient/EmpathyQuotient.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glennrowe.net/BaronCohen/EmpathyQuotient/EmpathyQuoti...</a><p><pre><code>   (this is not a test used in clinical settings)

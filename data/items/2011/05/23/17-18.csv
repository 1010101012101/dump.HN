Shouldn't that give you enormous leverage to negotiate with your employer? It often takes a lot of time and effort to get someone new up to your level.

2576844,comment,2576429,2576429,28,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think its a silly piece, and not really a cogent argument. The author claims 'mobile' apps will be supplanted by 'web' apps (presumably running in a browser which is running on a mobile device). The reasoning breaks down into three claims;<p>1) There are many more web users than there are mobile users (author claims 2 Billion vs 50 Million)<p>2) There are some browser apps (Angry birds and NY Times cited) which give you 'offline' access.<p>3)The HTML5 in the browser will become a unifying API to local functions which will ease development.<p>So lets take these claims one by one and see how they hold up.<p>Market Size - ok there are a lot more web browsers than mobile users. And yet if you look at growth rates (especially if you count 'tablets') the number of users with 'mobile' capability is growing faster than pure web browser seats. If you look at user capability the 'mobile' user may want to do things like 'check in' (location based) or navigate which the generic browser user doesn't do. Finally if you consider the underlying UX tools its just as painful to make an App which works well on 1920 x 1080 screen with mouse/keyboard as it does on an 800 x 400 screen with just touch points.<p>Browser Apps with offline access - This moves the browser closer to hosting the 'OS experience' of the device away from the underlying OS. Google would love to do that since they would realize Sun Microsystem's dream of being able to ship a browser which was the OS can cut out the OS provider (either Microsoft or Apple in this case). However adding this layer not only impacts performance, it also impacts compability since browsers with the same name and version work differently from platform to platform. Not so with mobile apps.<p>HTML5 will develop access to native APIs - I read this, and I imagine all of the zero day exploits that will come of it, if it comes to pass. You take two engineering teams in two separate companies, one providing an OS API and the other providing access to it, and you get Flash all over again. Both development teams come from the problem from different directions and create unexpected problems for the other.<p>Bottom line for me is that I'm not convinced the browser can kill anything except other browsers. That being said, I also think there are big opportunities in mobile / tablet device space for innovations in the operating system, the UX frameworks, and the distribution mechanisms.<p>Disclaimer though is that I was one of the Java guys and I had completely bought into the notion of 'write once, run anywhere'. Making that true turned out to be impossible for a number of reasons, not the least of which that the underlying OS providers were hostile to the idea. So creating an HTML5 uber-alles experience for developing apps seems optimistic to me.",1306173421

Afterwards? (In which case, can I just walk out and screw the retailer?) Do I as the user set up the bill, or does the merchant and I have to review it?

The 'shutdown', or technically in my companies case the 'plant shutdown', and the 'furlough' day.<p>At my company, the factory has 7,000 employees in one location. So many people took vacation between Christmas and New Years that the factory simply can not operate. The solution was either to only give that time off for a select group of people (pissing off most of the factory guys), or to make everyone take that time off (pissing off the few that used to come in that week and goof off).<p>Unfortunately they extended it from the guys in the factory up to the engineers. Which really makes no sense. I'm working on a project that won't hit the factory floor for another year. Why can't I work between Christmas and New Years? I would be amazingly produtive without all the meetings and distractions. Not only do we have to take the time off and use vacation (or not get paid and don't come in), but we are not allowed to come in even if we wanted to. I assume this is all negotiated with the unions, they never want the salaried guys to have perks that they don't have. So for I end up burning 3-5 out of 10 vacation days a year on a week I absolutely do NOT want to take off. But I still get paid for those days at least. And there are ways to get around it (floating holidays, i.e. work 40 hours in 4 days in a week with a holiday gives you the holiday back) which in effect allow you to have your full 2 weeks. If that was not the case I think the salaried engineers would have fought back against the practice more. Although I guess most people with kids like that week off anyway, I just view it as a waste, I like taking my vacation during the times those with kids can't take vacation. Everything is cheaper and less crowded.<p>A 'furlow' is an unpaid day that the company forces you to take. A lot of government employees have these now, you must take 1-5 days off a year and not get paid for those days. In effect it is a pay cut but in exchance you get more vacation days. The most interesting thing about the furlough is that very often you see people given a choice between everyone taking a few days furlough or a bunch of people getting fired. More often than not, everyone votes to have a few people fired.",1306172824

On top of that, you are also likely going to have deductions for health/dental/etc insurance, and then pre-tax payments to your retirement plan (401k).<p>Separately, the company must pay a few other taxes on that $60k (nowhere near 40%, though)",1306172801

They also hide a lot of the details of what's going on under the covers with their JavaScript library.<p>With Animator, we've tried to minimize the distance between what you do in the tool and what you'd do with hand-built animations. This means that the outputted source is relatively easy to tweak as you see fit. Animations can also be fitted relatively easily into your existing page source by specifying classes etc.<p>When you nest an animation, for example, you're nesting a DIV under the covers. You can manually set z-indices, so the animation doesn't blow up the rest of your page. You can manually enter rgba colors into the color pickers etc.<p>The #1 target for Animator is mobile animations on iPhone/iPad/Android, so we only do CSS Animations, which are hardware accelerated on iOS and should be soon on Android. We could do a JavaScript polyfill like Hype, but JavaScript animations are frankly terrible on mobile because JavaScript timers are really crappy. (That said, we'll probably do a JavaScript polyfill at some stage if people really want them.)<p>Some other things about Animator - nested animations.

When you're young, have no kids, no mortgage, no car loan, etc, it's pretty easy to just say ""fuck off, see ya"" when your employer acts abusively.<p>When you have all of the above, that becomes more difficult. Relocating is more often than not the norm in this industry, and you don't exactly want to sell your house, or move your kids around, etc etc.<p>Disclaimer: I don't have kids, or a mortgage, and I'm <i>very</i> mobile right now, but I also understand this probably won't last forever.<p>It's a warning for living beyond your means anyways - I've noticed many people that I work with have <i>huge</i> mortgages out, to the point where the continuous stream of income becomes <i>paramount</i> - even a few months of interruption could possibly mean ruin for them.

Also, since it is often times rural in nature, said ISPs may not get you service because there aren't enough subscribers on your street. So there is that problem. The other is this: pricing. In my city there is only 2 broadband ISPs, both have settled on pretty high prices for pretty slow speeds but since they have absolutely no incentive to add value for their customers, it has stayed that way for the past 4 years. Those two issues essentially lead down the road to where if you are a business and you want decent broadband, you must pay out the nose, and even then you may not be able to get it due to the company not wanting to run the lines.<p>If there was a municipal provider broadband could be more affordable, and more easily accessible.

With the associated costs.<p>Split your application into its core pieces (written in something reasonably portable, and kept modular where you can) and partition the rest into the platform-specific frameworks and calls, assuming that you can't find an analog to what was once called a ""4GL"" that meets your requirements and your budget.<p>And from the last time that the third-party 4GL schemes and their sales-critters were prowling the areas I was then working in, it was easy to end up looking at Morton's fork choice.  More than a few folks saw their ""portable"" applications locked into the 4GL frameworks and its continued development plans.

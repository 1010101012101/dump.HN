In my opinion it's not honest.<p>I don't know how much more honest an admission that a prediction was wrong by respected scientist can be. What do you want? This AGW issue is so politically charged that we <i>want</i> the scientists to be constantly going over the data and trying to reproduce it.<p>It's not like the IPCC was trying to hide this. If anything, the entire way this scenario played out should be a <i>reassurance</i> that the IPCC and cooperating scientists are acting in good faith.

1159412,comment,1158752,1159327,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Take it from this ""denier"", the vast bulk of my ""denialism"" comes from what you're saying. Where there should have been humility in the face of chaos, there was claims of certainty, and where there should have been more research, there was a push to rewrite the foundation of the global economy in the service of dubious truths.<p>This is a classic example of the flaw in so many GWD's reasoning. You deliberately choose not to base your opinion on a scientific matter on actually reading studies, listening to experts, observing evidence and learning about the underlying physics.<p>Instead you write 3 paragraphs that reduce, ""I don't like YOU or how YOU are saying it."" You reduce a complex and ongoing field of study down to a personality judgement. Does my personality or personal failings in any way change the science? Of course not. But somehow that's so relevant to the issue at hand that it's the majority of your post.<p>All I can do—as someone who's expertise and education lies in computer science and math—is understand some of the underlying physics, read some of the less dense papers, and listen to the experts. I don't like all the experts, but they're experts. I don't have to like them for their opinion to be right.<p>But, if you're trying to suggest I'm committing a specific logical fallacy, please name and explain it. Otherwise, your character judgements don't really bear relevance in this conversation save as a mean-spirited attack.",1267469633

1159406,comment,1158589,1159105,0,0,dkarl,,,"Intelligence dedicated to solving abstract or impersonal problems is worthless for a leader.  Therefore, the kind of intellectual talents that show up on an IQ test are not very useful.  Someone who takes a problem-solving approach to the world will not make a good leader.  Someone who takes a problem-solving approach to his parents, friends, classmates, and so forth will do well.<p>That's because leadership consists in large part of stating and forging a group consensus, perhaps not in that order.  A leader rarely suggests a course of action that doesn't immediately make sense to other people.  If education and elucidation is required, he does that beforehand.  A leader doesn't bother with courses of action that his followers aren't already one little nudge away from accepting, and then he provides that nudge.  For this reason, it's best for a leader not to devote too much intelligence to actually solving problems -- he will just come up with useless and distracting ideas.  A leader with a lot of credibility can get people to accept a new course of action solely on his own credibility, but if it doesn't work out, he loses a lot of credibility.  He mostly needs to stick to courses of action that are credited to other people or which just feel right to his followers.<p>Leading by surpassing excellence is an invention of propaganda.  Only after you already have a lot of power and loyalty can you start manufacturing such a myth.",1267469499

Thought it might be useful for others to see what to expect:<p>The meeting is pretty informal. I didn't bring anything special with me and haven't applied formally to AlphaLab yet.<p>You'll meet with 1 AlphaLab employee and they will stick close to the 20 minutes you have with them. I'm pretty familiar with the AlphaLab process, so we skipped those details and instead talked about my idea. They asked about the concept, business models, the market, what some of the competitors are up to, things you would expect. At this stage, they weren't brainstorming too much with me, more listening. Then they asked about my background a bit and asked me where I was in terms of talking with potential customers. Then they opened it up to any other questions.<p>I asked about when is best to apply, early, later, asap? - turns out they do not look at any of the apps until after the deadline. So it does not hurt you or help you really in any way to apply now or 1 minute before the deadline. This was important for me since right now I'm a solo founder actively looking for a technical co-founder (get in touch with me if you're a developer looking for a new opportunity with interested customers!). I was advised to wait until I did find someone before applying, or if the deadline approaches, include a plan for how I would plan to outsource or find help to build the app.<p>The other aspect is even more informal networking with the current founders of AlphLab and some of the other hopefuls who hang out before and after their meeting times. This was helpful for some feedback on the pitch, brainstorming, stuff like that. Plus interesting to hear what everyone is working on!<p>I don't have a good gauge on how the meeting went, but it seemed to go smoothly and I left feeling even more pumped up about the opportunity.

We seem to believe that since physics is the most difficult subject to master, that means the most intelligent people have to do physics. That is pretty poor reasoning; I would think people with higher IQs may be better off as polymaths with a wide exposure to arts AND the sciences (and engineering).<p>Goethe, for example, had a very high IQ and even though he wrote about science, his greatest contribution to humanity was his literature.",1267466680

It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages; the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage; neither our wisdom nor our learning; neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country; it measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it tells us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.</i>",1267466668

If both go up together nothing changes.<p>The difference is measured from absolute zero, so if both go up 1 degree there is actually even less of a difference than there was before.<p>Since the water is warm, and the air cold, and every model shows water temperature rise lagging air temperature rise, global warming should cause less hurricanes.<p>The higher intensity might be because the water would become warmer, and air temperature is not a constant. If a hurricane should happen to form when it's cold out, it'll be somewhat more powerful.",1267466565

1159283,comment,1159100,1159100,0,0,jeromec,,,"I completely agree with this. As the article mentions with shoestring resources it's helpful to make ""bang for the buck"" choices. For any given successful product, there will be a few things that really resonate with or significantly help the user. The trick is figuring out what these things are. If you hit upon a truly valuable function, chances are your user base will grow even if there is not much else other than that available. A great example of this is Google. When Google was just starting out there were many popular search engines, and the biggest, Yahoo, had tons of money, resources, and content/features available from their homepage. By contrast, Google had a simple search box on their page - but the results returned were clearly superior. The rest, of course, is history. Sure Google now has email, docs, apps, calendar, social services, etc. but they didn't start out that way, and didn't need to. I believe the best strategy is to try and figure out what will really benefit users, not the nice to haves, but what really benefits them, and focus on building that to the best of your ability. Don't sacrifice quality. How you solve the problem should be as top notch as you can make it, but solve the problem and that's it; don't get distracted. Then test it out and see where you stand.",1267466505

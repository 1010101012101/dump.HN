You touch on some interesting concepts that deserve thought...<p>Alas, phrases like ""snot-nosed kids"", ""Google's douche-tsunami"" and ""little sociopath"" betray both personal bias and anger. Phrases like these make it too easy to dismiss this article as little more than a rant.<p>I believe that if you're going to call out an industry on ethics, you have to pursue the article as a journalist would.

The problem is that diffs with it can look like a total mess because a whole lot of things are happening in that one line.<p>Similarly, certain languages where program flow or control structures make it so that people are inclined to make many things happen in one line (inline regex, lisp or scheme syntax lanagues) can diff in a confusing manner.<p>Diff is great when everyone is using a coding/whitespace standard, and things tend to atomically happen on one line.<p>I'd encourage that when refactoring code that's not to the standard, you do two passes - one to clean up the code to the standard, then another to make the actual changes.",1333899964

For me it all has to do with dealing with the little interruptions from people throughout the day.<p>Ideally this wouldn't happen at all, and I could focus 100% on what I'm supposed to be doing. But in the real world, people people interact, a phone call/email etc.... When I'm coding and someone arrives at my desk and says something like ""Sorry to bother you this will only take a minute..."", it triggers my fingers (C-R n) and once the conversation has ended I hopefully have notes of action items I need to address maybe even with a due date if i'm lucky.(C-c C-c) Or if it was pointless/not actionable (C-c C-k) and my cursor is right back where I was before being interrupted.<p><pre><code>  http://sachachua.com/blog/2008/01/capturing-notes-with-remember/\n  http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/remember.html\n</code></pre>\nI also track time with org-mode.

Applications can allocate more than the amount of  physical memory, at which point the system can become unusable.

It's not true of many other actor systems, including Akka, which merely suggests arguments be treated as immutable.<p>Perhaps the most interesting system that doesn't depend on immutability is Kilim. Kilim allows ownership transfer of objects between actors, causing exceptions to be raised if you attempt to access objects which have been sent to other actors.

It is even more difficult to change something that is both working and <i>growing like gangbusters</i>. And the larger something grows, the harder it is to change.<p>(Ironically, things with no customers are easy to change. And things that are obviously broken are also easy to change: It's broken, the worst that can happen is that it becomes <i>twice</i> as broken, so just go for it.)<p>There's a famous aphorism attributed to Napoleon: ""Never interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake."" Rule zero of systems engineering is the inverse of this: Never interrupt yourself while you're succeeding. Do not kill the golden goose.<p>So, the first thing that has to happen for Apple to make significant changes in their process is that they have to <i>stop succeeding so darn much</i>. While the App Store is working they're unlikely to change the process. And, indeed, it doesn't seem like much <i>has</i> changed: They've fixed obviously broken things like months-long review wait times (as I said above, fixing obviously-broken things is relatively easy) but they haven't really changed the fundamental game plan. Why should they? It's raining money.<p>There are several reasons why it takes so long to improve working things:<p>Entire companies are built on the existing Apple model, broken as it may be. Break their revenue stream and these companies will scream and yell.<p>It's easier to swim <i>with</i> the tide of institutional inertia than against it. If you have to hire one hundred new App Store reviewers per month, those people need to be trained. There is (at least at first) no textbook for that job, or perhaps the manual is two years out of date. And nobody reads manuals anyway. And some important parts of <i>any</i> job are not written down anywhere. So the new folks will learn by watching over the shoulders of existing App Store reviewers. And so it goes: As things scale up, it becomes easier and easier to let the existing culture maintain itself, bolting on new parts as necessary, rather than try to change that culture.<p>When you want to change a working thing, it's not enough to show that your new version works. You must also demonstrate that it's a significant improvement over what you're doing now. This can take a lot of time. Science is patient work. If you're lucky you can run continuous A/B tests of small changes, and thereby gradually inch your way forward to a brighter future, but how do you A/B test App Store features when the developer community has a clue and a forum? Offer a feature to one developer on Monday, and by Tuesday night all the others will be at your metaphorical gate with metaphorical torches and pitchforks, demanding the feature for themselves. You have to go <i>very</i> slowly. It pays to do so below the radar.",1333898950

Trying to reverse the process to identify the semantic significance of changes after the fact is far beyond us today.<p>In fact, it's hard to see how we could ever move beyond that level without developing some new and much more semantically rich way to represent our programs.

But a system of online Transactions of Repeated Results is not a domain they seem to really be serving now. So a small, possibly disruptive player could get some traction.<p>It would seem a good fit for younger scientists at less prestigious (poorer) institutions, looking to get some form of objectively validated reputation they can cite for career reasons while they work to catch up to some part of the advancing-edge of research in their field.<p>With enough traffic of scientists openly trying to reproduce the results in other journals (sometimes succeeding, sometimes not), it would be only a matter of time before some journals that have a bias toward ""surprising"" to the detriment of ""true"" get bitten by repeated results in the TRR that go against what they published.

There are server-side frameworks that <i>don't</i> throw away the world, and client-side frameworks that do.

3813975,comment,3813904,3813904,2,0,jtheory,,,"Well, I don't do it much anymore, but in the past I've wasted innumerable hours arguing online about religion, or in debates that are irrevocably tainted by religion (like abortion, evolution/intelligent design, etc.).  So that's a negative result.  But I have been an atheist for decades, so there's no need to respect any religious edicts.<p>I've long gotten the sense that hackers have a better-than-average grasp of rationality, which means fewer of them ascribe to any major religion (though being more vaguely ""spiritual"", meditating, etc. isn't ruled out).  There's just such a huge amount of obvious nonsense wrapped up in major religions that if you have the habit of taking things apart to see how they work, you'll eventually apply that to this <i>thing</i> that your parents told you should be a central part of your life, and religion doesn't stand up well to analysis that doesn't assume its truth.<p>Hackers still usually have families, though -- sometimes families who are very dedicated to religion -- which means there are quite a lot who still go through the motions (at least when visiting home, for example) just so their Grandmother doesn't have a heart-attack because she thinks her grandchild is going to hell.<p>I personally just sort my way through the conflicts as patiently as possible (I have a family that's full of pretty serious Catholics), because I can't stomach faking it, and generally I'm not harassed about it, much.<p>For religious hackers -- I suspect their religion's requirements aren't too heavy.  Generally we're more productive when we take breaks now and then, so feeling obligated to stop and think of something else for a bit is probably a good thing.<p>Whether they make a difference in decisions otherwise -- possibly, but probably not as you might think.  I grew up in a wealthy area, and Christmas mass meant a parking lot full of expensive cars and pews full of fur coats.  If they actually listened to the sermons, they'd hear they had the same chance to pass into heaven as a camel through a needle's eye, but that didn't affect how they used their money as far as I could see.<p>On the contrary, among people who are genuinely interested in making the world a better place, I suspect an atheist would be more likely to carefully analyze complicated situations before deciding what path might lead to better results, and test the outcomes... whereas anyone with strong religious beliefs would believe they already knew what was required.  Think of how many AIDS cases could have been avoided if so many Christian missionaries weren't opposed to birth control....<p>I've long hoped that greater interconnectedness will lead to less belief in the supernatural globally, but that hasn't been the case so far -- I don't have the study link, but from what I've read people are more likely to seek out like-minded sites/people, to reinforce their beliefs, <i>not</i> sample widely to find out if other approaches might be more valid.<p>Create a startup targeted at religious people?  Not seriously.  I've toyed with the idea of creating sites to explain gently & non-aggressively what atheism is and why some people choose to be non-believers, or to offer support to people trapped in highly-religious communities and families who have lost their faith -- but idea #1 would likely be fairly useless (see previous paragraph), and some sites already exist for idea #2.",1333897417

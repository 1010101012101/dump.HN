We are in a terrible terrible mess that was predicted by a very select few that have been shouting out for years by this point. The majority of economists seemed to think everything was just fine. I read somewhere that the world has lost 40% of it's wealth in this recession. This tells me that the old systems, even if I don't understand them, aren't working that great. They very well be the best we have, but it doesn't take a rocket scientists or macro-economists to see that.",1234198732

Yes macroeconomics is complicated, and yes we have created concepts in our financial systems that are beyond the understanding of everyone involved.  But the basic fundamentals still apply and should still be discussed in the context of the more complex systems.  The idea of long-term equilibrium doesn't disappear just because your financial system is convoluted.<p>The foundation of macroeconomics is the aggregation of microeconomics, which comes down to people making decisions with their money.

Speaking as a manager who has seen this play out several times at different companies, a performance improvement plan should always be seen as invitation to leave.  It always surprises me how few people get that. The company is essentially saying, ""We're just not that into you.""<p>If the company is large enough, they'll almost always be willing to pay you something (4-6 weeks salary is fairly standard) to go away quietly. Your best bet is to negotiate some kind of exit package while simultaneously looking for new employment. If you're good at it you can dovetail them so that your employment record is seamless. Your employer may even be willing to give you time off to interview.  (Remember, they <i>want</i> you to leave.)<p>The chances of making a comeback after being put on a PIP are slim.  It's a HR formality that's essentially a prelude to termination, to protect the company from potential litigation.  I don't have hard numbers, but I'd estimate that 75%+ of employees placed on a PIP will either leave or be terminated within 3 months.<p>Lastly, a PIP doesn't mean you're a bad person. In fact, it may not even be a reflection of your performance. Sometimes personality and budget issues play a large role.  American companies don't have many options when cutting staff, and they often default to this one when they don't want ""layoff"" headlines.  I'm not defending it (it's a sucky practice), but see it for what it is, try not to take it personally, and get the hell out before things get really bad.",1234197393

Sure, looks are superficial ways to recommend matches, but that's just to get the conversation started (as it is on every dating website, pretty much ever). There's also a key here that you don't get while searching on a traditional site: (in theory) people will recommend matches for you that are actually somewhat attainable rather than everyone drowning the hottest people in contact requests. This should get people closer to more likely matches than they'd get otherwise.<p>Looks absolutely matter-- and while it is superficial, it's clear that this is what people base first impressions on. We're not looking to be highbrow-- we're looking to help people meet those they'd look good with. I personally agree that I'd hesitate a little, but we tried to find a middleground without going overboard. We'll keep an eye on that, though-- thanks for the feedback there.<p>As for matchmaking:
The idea is for friends to play matchmaker as much/more than random people-- after you signup, you're given a personal widget that matches you up with potential people. And you would send it to friends, embed in your MySpace profile, etc.<p>For example:

As such, lots of schools teach C.  Ada never hit that critical mass (as Java and C/C++ did) where people learned it because so many other people knew it rather than because it was cool.  Why does everyone in the world learn English?  Because more of the world's money speaks English than any other language.  So, if you want one of those C++ jobs, you'd better know C++ - not because it's good, but because so many other important things use it.<p>* Because Ada isn't that fast.  It's significantly slower than C according to the language shootout (<a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/</a>).  It's one saving grace is that it's decently efficient on memory - not as efficient as C, but efficient enough that it can be used for things you wouldn't want to use Java or Lisp for.<p>To an extent, it was too little too late.  C was introduced in 1972 and quickly gained fame. Ada, a decade later in 1983, does have dome value, but it also has things many programmers would find annoying (like a syntax that requires more typing).  Sometimes, you need to provide enough reason for people to switch.  A tiny enhancement isn't always enough.  Plus, companies like C because it's everywhere and easy to find programmers (whether that argument holds true or not is debatable, but companies still base their decisions off it).<p>There might not be anything particularly wrong with Ada, but that can still leave no catalyst that is getting programmers to learn it.  There aren't a lot of things written in Ada (compared to C/C++/Java) and so it isn't the ""I'll get a job with it"" excuse.

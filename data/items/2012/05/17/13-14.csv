Shop for schools? I'd love to. I'd even like for my kids to go to a school close to their home.

Firstly, there are numerous forms of intelligence (as the first phrase of its wikipedia entry confirms). Secondly, sticking to the IQ kind of intelligence, most tasks require only a sufficient amount of it (say, more than 90 or so), more of it doesn't necessarily help. The guy with the highest IQ I ever met (180 or something) had a junior job (at 40yo) as a statistical analyst in a bank. This applies also to developers: for instance, getting things done is more important than being IQ-smart.\nThirdly, and I think this is the poster's point, the form of intelligence I came to admire the most (and I find most useful) is the one that makes you humble enough to know what you don't know, and capable of listening to and appreciating people who think differently from you.

So is Flickr and Wikipedia (hey, they'll give you the software for free!) and lots of other sites, but it's hard to recreate the same passionate community.<p>I think the important value that Pinterest has is the community of pinners and their collective aggregated opinions. That community has the potential to actually be quite a useful testbed and market research mechanism (or even sales channel) for a lot of consumer brands. Maybe not $1.5bn worth of value, but there's quite a bit of space in the social web for more of a female-oriented, arts-and-craftsy, fashionable, aspirational type of site.<p>Go to your local magazine seller: there's a lot of women's oriented magazines, lifestyle oriented magazines... that's where I think the value in Pinterest is, as a sort of online complement to ""aspirational lifestyle"" brands.",1337261547

The OSU study contradicted lots of other studies that found nothing conclusive for nearly the same hypothesis.  The author of the study managed to fit a curve that he was apparently looking for by allowing for enormous flexibility on the time axis.  That's like finding pictures in clouds.  You can see what you want to see if you look at something from enough angles.  To be meaningful, you would need to apply those findings to lots of other data sets to see if you're just seeing what you want to see or if there's a real likelihood of a pattern.  Science isn't finding one occurrence of something that you were looking for.  Science is predicting where and how you'll find something and then having others find you're right over and over.<p>On the Youtube lecture:  The statistics seem to show correlation, but causation?  Is the inequality the cause of a lack of trust?  Or is it the other way around?  Furthermore, I saw lots of other correlations in the data they showed.  Graph homogeneity of the population's ethnical background vs trust.  Look at the states and countries that scored high trust.  At a glance, they seemed to be the highly ethnically/religiously/culturally unified ones.<p>> Nope. I think revenue spending isn't really good metric of government power<p>Okay, what would you suggest... Watts?<p>> I'd wager that there is quite a bit of income inequality if your gov. revenue is low but they spend a lot of money.<p>Wait, your conjecture agrees with me.  Spending is high and inequality is high.  The gov. revenue is almost a non-factor in terms of government power.  For the part of the curve where the currency hasn't been completely devalued because of over-borrowing and printing money, the amount the government spends is all that your really need to describe government power.  Lack of revenue to back it up is just a ginormous credit card bill that no one seems to remember is out there.",1337261297

Its was $90 just for a module to ""get it on the internet"" via RJ45 ethernet.<p>I did it again 3 months ago with a TP-Link 703 running openwrt. $22. Built-in wifi AND RJ45, usb port for io. (although I used the GPIO hooked up to is LED to save a few bucks). So that made it cheaper than buying a new remote at sears. Now I can see if the door is open and open and close it from anyhere.

It would be great to a have a single page that shows:<p>1. A subset of the LevelDB benchmark applied to IndexedDB in Chrome and Firefox where possible (and compared to the same operations against Kyoto Cabinet and raw LevelDB).<p>2. Time to allocate a 1mb, 10mb, 100mb, 1gb TypeArray, and timings for standard operations on these.<p>3. WebSocket transfer speeds and browser memory usage, for binary data with 1mb, 10mb, 100mb, 1gb message sizes (and compared to the fastest non-browser WebSocket clients).<p>4.

They've been eroding steadily over the last century, resulting in the overly powerful executive branch we have today. For example, there was a time when the president did not have the ability to wage war without legislative approval.<p>The progressives (circa 1900) were not the first group that wished to diminish checks and balances, but they were the most consistent opponents of that system. And because they had a complete, systematic ideology, they succeeded in their goals, even though they were incorrect. See the following paragraph from Woodrow Wilson's book, ""The New Freedom: A Call for the Emancipation of the Generous Energies of a People"":<p>""The trouble with the theory is that government is not a machine, but a living thing. It falls, not under the theory of the universe, but under the theory of organic life. It is accountable to Darwin, not to Newton. It is modified by its environment, necessitated by its tasks, shaped to its functions by the sheer pressure of life. No living thing can have its organs offset against each other, as checks, and live. On the contrary, its life is dependent upon their quick co-operation, their ready response to the commands of instinct or intelligence, their amicable community of purpose. Government is not a body of blind forces; it is a body of men, with highly differentiated functions, no doubt, in our modern day, of specialization, with a common task and purpose. Their co-operation is indispensable, their warfare fatal. There can be no successful government without the intimate, instinctive co-ordination of the organs of life and action. This is not theory, but fact, and displays its force as fact, whatever theories may be thrown across its track. Living political constitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in practice. Society is a living organism and must obey the laws of life, not of mechanics; it must develop.""<p>(from <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14811/14811-h/14811-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14811/14811-h/14811-h.htm</a>)",1337259645

If you told people that Japan would be the second largest economy in the world thirty-five years after WWII, people would've thought you were crazy. I wouldn't be surprised if Baghdad is a top international city in, say, 2045.<p>> Let's not forget the long-term effects of British rule in places as far-flung as Ireland, Cyprus and - of course - Iraq and the rest of the Middle East. A policy of divide-and-rule led to pretty awful consequences.<p>Well, Iraq and the Middle East is actually a good example in the other direction - it was ruled by the Ottoman Empire fairly decently for quite a while (it did get corrupt and ugly at the end). Anyways, I don't say it's a perfect governance or all roses all the time, just that it's outperformed most other models on most key metrics.",1287057382

Though that's a rubbish answer, and probably accidentally passive-aggressive. So here's a longer one:<p>People in the tech world love joining clubs that give no real reward. People started joining Facebook because it was cool to be in the Facebook Club, same with Twitter, the iPhone, new communities etc. I'm over-simplifying it, but that's because The Club I built is exactly that; a crude over-simplification of an already existing and replicated system.<p>The value comes from the psychology. Paying to be in something early and fun, even though there is no intrinsic reason, is nice. It's similar to how trophies and rewards work on other sites and in games.

Example: if your break malfunctions in your car, you'd get it fixed instead of replacing your car with a bike.<p>> 2) JavaScript is a privacy threat: This has a lot to do...<p>Native applications can also do that. Here you could easily write a browser extension to disable mouse tracking or whatever you wish, you don't get this so easy anywhere else.<p>> 3) JavaScript saves bandwidth: I think that not so much because of the initial load of a webpage. JS enables a webpage to costantly query back to the server. An example is gmail, and the notification for a new email, while you are logged into gmail.<p>If you do this correctly you could mostly get away with few bytes per request.

For that I ran\nnumerical experiments with constant peeking, literally every time you\nadd one to A and one to B you peek again.  You can see graphs of how\nmany errors there were, and how long it takes to get an answer.<p>Here are key points:<p>- Be suspicious of tests that end quickly.  Run them a bit longer on\ngeneral principal.  (In general I'd call 500 people a very small\ntest.)<p>- Nobody can predict how long a test will take.  Even if you know the\nactual improvement, you still can't predict time to within an order of\nmagnitude.<p>- If a test has been running for a long time you know the true\ndifference is small, so there is no harm in accepting whatever answer\nit gives.</i>",1287054877

It has 5 races in it, 2 very dominant religions and several suppressed ones (it did once have a history of Christianity and Buddhism).

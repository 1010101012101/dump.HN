In particular, how is the printing of money by Venezuela different from the printing that goes on in the West (Quantitative Easing).<p>I guess the only difference is that in the West, the money goes mostly to the banks, which distribute it to the companies or invest it in the stock market and real estate. Consequently, the rich get richer and the poor don&#x27;t see any of this money.<p>But I can&#x27;t see why the situation in Venezuela would be any different.

10105963,comment,10104713,10105814,0,0,sdenton4,,,"<i>Treating someone differently because they have a lower income than others is discriminatory.</i><p>Wealth is not a protected class; unlike gender, race, and religion, we don&#x27;t have a legal mandate to avoid making decisions based on a person&#x27;s wealth.<p><i>It&#x27;s about everyone paying their fair share.</i><p>What does &#x27;fair&#x27; mean, though?  Another &#x27;fair&#x27; scheme might be that everyone pays the same raw amount (rather than a fixed proportion of their income).  After all, isn&#x27;t it discriminatory to include a person&#x27;s income in the formula for how much one should pay?  Our tax code then looks like:<p>Tax(person) = requiredRevenue / nPopulation<p>Unfortunately, this ends up requiring poor people to pay more than they actually generate, requiring government to throw the poor in jail for tax evasion and tax more to cover the cost of the prisons.<p>Ok, so we should be allowed to use a person&#x27;s income as a parameter to the tax equation.  The &#x27;flat&#x27; tax scheme is to use a formula like:<p>Tax(person) = fixedRatio x person.Income<p>The fixed ratio can again be figured out by looking at total income of the population and the required revenue.<p>Two major criticisms (amongst many):\na) The marginal utility of money is greatly increased when you don&#x27;t have much of it.  A 15% tax on $20k a year will lead to eviction, hunger and health problems, creating social ills that we&#x27;ll need government programs to deal with.  Or they&#x27;ll just not pay the tax, so again with the prisons.  And again, the overall tax needs to be increased to deal with a stupid choice in the tax code.  This is inefficient and arguably unfair.<p>b) Furthermore, if we don&#x27;t want to punish the poor for being poor, we have to reduce the ratio, meaning we greatly reduce investment in infrastructure, education, etc, mainly as a result of undertaxing the wealthy to avoid punishing the poor.  This also seems hella backwards.<p>So maybe we end up with something like:<p>Tax(person) = min(0, r_0 + r_1 person.Income + r_2 (person.Income - baseIncome)^2)<p>with r_i fixed coefficients.  So now we have four parameters to choose (or more, if we want a more general polynomial).  And suddenly this requires real policy decisions to be made with some nuance...<p>So to me, it comes down to a question of whether we want to over-simplify the question of how to fund government - negatively impacting either a broad class of the population or drastically degrading the services provided by government - or whether we trust a segment of the civil service to do something a bit more nuanced.<p>I come down on the &#x27;fix the fucking government&#x27; side, personally.",1440348378

Isn&#x27;t that just as problematic from a security perspective?<p>I&#x27;m guessing by &quot;untrusted system&quot; that we&#x27;re talking about an SSH host for which you do not already have and verify the SSH host fingerprint (see side note below). And so, for example, you try to connect to that host, but instead your request is MITMed and the attacker has control of your session with that remote host.<p>Or put another way: what attack vectors are prevented/mitigated by disabling the key on use? (and this is separate from the very inconvenient aspect regarding: how do I connect back to that host after my one session is over?)<p>(side note: I believe that if you don&#x27;t verify host keys, then SSH is completely, 100% useless against MITM/proxy attacks, whether you allow the key to be used 1 or infinite times.

Any time there is an interest group (which can be one person, one corporation, an industry, etc.) that wants something that is highly advantageous to itself and costs a very large number of other people a very small amount of money each, that interest group will always pay a small portion of its benefit to politicians for support, and politicians will always support it.  This is because it&#x27;s not worthwhile for millions of individuals to band together and defeat something that costs each one only a few cents.  Literally, the time it takes (whether to make a donation, write a letter, or make whatever other trivial contribution) exceeds the value of shutting down the special interest.<p>Intuit likes income-tax returns and tax laws in general that are complex.  But there are hundreds of other special interests, most very narrow, that favor specific bits of the tax code and will lobby to keep them.  Collectively, these things cost us trillions of dollars, but individually they are impossible to defeat because no single one is large enough to be worthwhile.<p>This happens in all representative democracies where tax law is set by the legislature.

10105858,comment,10104586,10105168,0,0,jblake,,,"$(document).on lets you keep your javascript source files relatively flat because the event handler listens on the document, rather than an individual element. So even if the element is not currently on the page (loaded in via AJAX for example) the $(document).on handler will still pick it up. You never need to bind or unbind event handlers manually. The rails recommended way is to respond to the JS format and do server-rendered javascript.... but I tend to prefer using a simple data-transport-only (JSON) api, then do the client stuff on the client side.<p>Simple example:<p><pre><code>  $(document).on &#x27;ajax:success&#x27;, &#x27;.guest-form&#x27;, ->\n    notify &#x27;success&#x27;, &#x27;Guest updated.&#x27;\n    $(@).parents(&#x27;.modal&#x27;).modal &#x27;hide&#x27;\n\n\n  $(document).ajaxError (event, jqxhr, settings, thrownError) ->\n  handle_ajax_error(event, jqxhr)\n\n\n  @handle_ajax_error = (error, xhr) ->\n  if xhr.status is 422\n    error = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)[&#x27;errors&#x27;]\n    notify &#x27;error&#x27;, error\n  else if xhr.status is 500\n    notify &#x27;error&#x27;, &#x27;Error communicating with the server. We have been notified.&#x27;\n  if xhr.status is 401\n    notify &#x27;warning&#x27;, &#x27;Session has expired. Redirecting to login...&#x27;\n    window.location = &#x27;/login&#x27;\n  if xhr.status is 403\n    window.location = &#x27;/access-denied&#x27;\n\n</code></pre>\nSo if you load in content via AJAX (I do this a lot for table views of data and the user wants to see a single record), rather than go to a separate page, I do an ajax call, put the result into a Twitter bootstrap modal, show the modal, and when the bs.modal.shown event fires, that &quot;single javascript function&quot; with the modal as the parameter is called, and it initializes all the javascript needed for that particular DOM container.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  $(document).on &#x27;shown.bs.modal&#x27;, &#x27;a[data-toggle=&quot;tab&quot;]&#x27;, (e) ->\n\n    $modal_body = $( $(e.target).attr(&#x27;href&#x27;) )\n    general_init $modal_body\n</code></pre>\nThe general_init function will initialize all my selectize elements (among other things) as such:<p><pre><code>  general_init = ($container) ->\n    add_selectize $container.find(&#x27;input.membership-plan-select&#x27;), $.extend(true, {}, Selects.MembershipPlanOptions)\n</code></pre>\nSo when writing forms, lets say to create a new &quot;Event Ticket&quot; I simply plop in a text field with a class of &quot;guest-select&quot; and I instantly have an AJAX powered search field to find/create a guest to assign that ticket to.",1440346709

Treating someone differently because they have a lower income than others is discriminatory. Just as treating someone with a higher income differently is discriminatory.<p>Plus, as soon as you open the law up to treating people differently based on some arbitrary criteria, you open it up to corruption. A few &quot;bribes&quot; here and there, and suddenly this company is part of a group that gets special treatment. Or this rich person is able to avoid paying extra taxes because of some loophole created because the Government treats some group differently.<p>Thus, it&#x27;s not about the &quot;poor&quot; paying their fair share. It&#x27;s about everyone paying their fair share.",1440345736

For example:<p>- First steps you have the text<p><pre><code>  - Step 1: &quot;Save Step 1&quot;  \n  - Step 2: &quot;Save and Proceed&quot;\n  - Step 3: &quot;Add employee&quot;\n</code></pre>\nYou should align the text of each button such &quot;Next step&quot; and &quot;Finish&quot;.<p>- Provide more text on each of the step to give better context with perhaps an example or an average for a specific country (selecting a country and auto-completing these fields with the average would be nice).<p>- Lot of lost space in Step 2 Setup Statutory Holidays. You could make the numbers bigger and space out evenly the selected days. Also it was quite weird to have an extra step with the selected days starred.<p>- Provide integration with 3rd party platforms: Google Calendar, Slack, login with Google account, etc.<p>- Provide a way to delete an account. How do I do that right now?<p>All in all it is pretty cool!",1440345733

For a few years I&#x27;ve been struggling to get sound diagnosis and treatment for a fatigue illnesses that I now understand has been caused by auto-immunity. Conventional medicine offered little help, but since I&#x27;ve undertaken a treatment to remove subconscious traumas, my health has steadily improved, to the point where &quot;normal&quot; health seems very much within reach.<p>The thing is, my illnesses can&#x27;t really be explained by my own traumatic experiences alone. By which I mean, I&#x27;ve had a relatively comfortable, privileged life and I haven&#x27;t had many experiences that others would consider highly traumatic, but from a young age I&#x27;ve always been highly sensitive and perceived traumas in situations that others would just take in their stride.<p>But when I reflect on the fact that my parents and grandparents could all be described as having been in a mildly traumatised state, it makes sense that this tendency in me was inherited.<p>Yes I get that I&#x27;m a sample size of one and it&#x27;s hardly objective.  But it feels an idea worthy of further consideration.  I&#x27;m doing whatever lab tests I can do of inflammation, cardio markers, hormone levels etc, so I can do comparisons as I continue the trauma-release process.  I&#x27;ll also be interested to see how I fare in life on illnesses like arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and Alzheimer&#x27;s, all of which are prevalent in my family.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone researching this kind of thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1314.011/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1314.011/a...</a>",1440345657

</code></pre>
Yes, yes and yes.<p><pre><code>    A side effect of using dynamically-typed language is that developers
    keep their naming conventions consistent and in check.
</code></pre>
I've not found this to be the case.  I just discussed method naming in Javascript with a developer today while I was reviewing his code.  He's a very good developer and this is an A+ codebase (no, it's not a pile of jQuery plugins...).  But he hadn't really thought about how to name some methods and didn't realize the confusion that would be caused in 6-18 months.  We left it as he had written it because it would have been a pain to hunt down the dependencies.<p>Were we working in a compiled world, we would have refactored and the compiler would have caught any missed dependencies in a second.<p><pre><code>    What I often see in the code, where type safety is enforced, - 
    is that developers get sloppy with names!
</code></pre>
I've definitely <i>not</i> seen that.  I maintain the same rigor w.r.t. hygiene whether I'm working in statically or dynamically typed languages, but I really miss the compiler when I'm working in dynamic languages.<p>At the risk of sounding really rude, can I ask whether your anecdotes are informed by work with <i>competent</i> developers?",1367027128

Our work allows for clarity and resolution of the aftermath of the mortgage crisis. This has a direct impact in the ability of lenders to establish more accurate risk models and re-enter the mortgage lending business.

I have a New Mum website which users can submit shopping tips to (it's mostly my friends at the moment). My boyfriend made an iPhone app for the website. It is basically a read-only app for my websites API (apart from login/register). I would like to offer my users an Android app also. The project description is:<p>-Splash screen<p>-Register screen (Facebook & Email)<p>-Login screen (Facebook & Email)<p>-Map screen showing ~100 icon markers (custom icon and popup)<p>--Map marker icons can be filtered by category, and API searched by date and title/location<p>-Detail screen, after you click on a map marker. It has 1 main image, hosted on my website and some details describing the item.<p>-iPhone graphics would be provided, but the Android developer will have to manage all Android design (for phones and tablets etc)<p>This isn't a job offer (just yet!), I would just like your 'gut instinct' quote, and any supporting comments or suggestions. I hope the app would be ready in 1 or 2 weeks, is that reasonable?<p>If there are any questions, I'll be glad to answer where I can!<p>You can also contact me at MichelleMarch8 at gmail.<p>Merci,<p>Michelle<p>Update: while this is a Europe centric request, quotes from all over are welcome!",1367024431

VC isn't just there to make your business awesome, they want their money back (in multiples of course).<p>I understand the benefits to VC and congrats on raising it, I just don't see how you can be in it for the long run.  How is that possible?",1367024412

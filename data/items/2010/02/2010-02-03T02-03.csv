It works on countries just as well as it does on individual people because countries are made up of the sum character of the people. Basically, it says that the harder someone tries to let others know about their abilities, the less animated they are by a deep sense of purpose. People with real, deep power and deep purpose don't boast. They're calm. But you know they have power. A second rate power like Russia is eager to boast about their military capabilities. China's Olympic spectacle last summer was a classic example of this notion. The only recent power I can think of that had that sense of calm was Great Britain. They just had the right stuff. And they changed the world. Churchill's speeches could have been written by any U.S. president. The EU sort of has it, but it's not willing to back it up with muscle...not necessarily war...but just declaration of purpose in their leaders. Maybe it's because they're secular. I don't know. But they don't really have it. No one does.",1265165887

1096944,comment,1096597,1096677,0,0,dasil003,,,"I noted this as well when I upgraded my blog to Rails 3 during the bugmash last month.   Rails suddenly has a lot more moving parts, and understanding the internals is much more difficult than it used to be.  However as a Rails developer for almost 5 years (gosh has it been that long?) every single change adds an order of magnitude more flexibility than complexity.  The surface API has grown remarkably little, but the modularity and internal API stability is dramatically improved.<p>The days of Rails being the scrappy upstart are over, but I think the culture and capabilities of Ruby have largely prevented the nightmarish type of scenarios that J2EE developed a reputation for.  I guess it's only fair to give it another 5-10 years and see what it looks like, but developing with Rails feels just as agile as ever even if the learning curve has been steepened.",1265165855

1096930,comment,1095793,1096728,0,0,dhess,,,"I think it's much more likely that something bad will happen during a build with ""sudo brew install some-package"" than someone successfully hijacking, say, my Safari session and then installing a trojan in my user-writable /usr/local directory. This <i>is</i> Mac OS X we're talking about: if you've written an exploit like that, why would you bother attacking apps in a directory that doesn't even exist on the vast majority of Mac installs when you could just as easily modify something in /Applications instead, and exploit practically all of them?<p>Anyway, back to the dangers of using sudo with Homebrew or Macports. When you build software by hand, without a package manager, do you ever do it as root? I sure don't. But that's exactly what Macports does in its default configuration, and that's what Homebrew would require if you used it with a non-writeable /usr/local.  It doesn't have to be a malicious attack, either: just a simple bug in the build system would suffice. For example, if a ""clean"" rule in a Makefile has a step that looks something like, god forbid, ""rm -rf $(BUILD_ROOT)/"" and you're running the make as root, you'd better hope that BUILD_ROOT is not defined to be """".<p>Ideally, all of these package managers would separate the step of <i>building</i> from the step of <i>installing</i> so that you would only need root privileges for the latter, a la Debian's sbuild and friends. Then using a traditional privileged /usr/local directory would be a no-brainer, for the theoretically smaller attack surface it would provide. But none of the Mac packaging systems work like that, to my knowledge. They go for the convenience of a single build+install command. Given that, I'll stick with my user-writable directory and risk the hijacking scenario.",1265165284

Set up a fake interview or staged encounter.<p>2. Immediately confuse the interlocutor with completely unreal mannerisms/speech.

Apple's system is managed by Apple, via Software Update. Depending on and modifying that system is foolhardy. What happens when the next point upgrade of OS X updates a library to a non-compatible version? Or what if you need ruby 1.8.7, but Leopard's ruby is at 1.8.6 (1.8.7 was a large release)? Your package system doesn't talk to Apple. Apple's update either breaks you, or your updates break OS X.<p>In fact, MacPorts once linked to OS X's libraries, but they found out how brittle this was, and switched to the current system.<p>OS X is not a Linux distribution, and it is not organized and defined by its package management system. If you want the flexibility of an open source Unix package system in OS X, you have to build one separately from Apple's Emerald City. The thing is, you can, and it works pretty well.<p>The problem I see most people having with the MacPorts / OS X duality actually stems from improper management of their shell's PATH. One way to manage namespace collisions is this: place MacPorts bin directories below the system PATH:<p><pre><code>    export PATH=""/usr/local/bin:$PATH:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin""
</code></pre>
and then create symlinks in /usr/local/bin to specific MacPorts executables that you would like to have on the top of the search stack. That way, you'll use Apple's binaries by default, and then you can cherry pick the MacPorts binaries that you would like to use in place of OS X's defaults. The inverse of this works quite well too.<p>> Dependency resolution and updates are basic or not working yet.<p>I'm sure this is in the works, but my feeling is that managing dependencies and updates are the raison d'être of a package management system. Without this, you just have an installation management system; a shortcut around `make' and `ln'.",1265162696

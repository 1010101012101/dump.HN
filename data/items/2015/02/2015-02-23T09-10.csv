</code></pre>
If you assume these are only needed in the first weeks of a project then it sounds like the classic waterfall fallacy. Preserving architectural consistency and evolving tech choices and adapting dev processes is a continuous process as a project grows and its easy to generate waste by front-loading too much of this.<p>My feedback on the list is that some of these qualities like handling risk, reuse, company/customer knowledge etc. should be expected of all senior devs. Other items like decision making, design diagrams, identifying standards etc. should be treated as tasks just like design, development and testing. They will regularly arise during a project and can be delegated across the team.<p>I would consolidate governance in the lead dev role - they are where the buck stops for all decisions, quality, consistency, delivery etc. but they do this by leading a team and delegating unlike an architect role that ring-fences categories of task for themselves.<p>Hope that helps!",1424684983

You work longer hours, and make substantially less. Unless you&#x27;re a founder, even in the event of a successful exit, the stock options will generally barely cover the cost of the paper they&#x27;re written on. Early employees don&#x27;t come out competitive with Google until you see billion-plus dollar exits.<p>Philip&#x27;s claim was that men tend to make decisions based on testosterone-fueled machismo, and go into areas considered &quot;hard-core&quot; like theoretical math, which rationally, are a waste of time and make no sense to study. As he phrases it, young men make the decision based on:<p>1. young men strive to achieve high status among their peer group
2. men tend to lack perspective and are unable to step back and ask the question &quot;is this peer group worth impressing?&quot;<p>This matches my anecdotal experience as well. Women tend to make more rational decisions, and pursue fields with a higher return-on-investment. Men tend to make irrational decisions, and either realize it later (with colossal failures, such as science jobs), or rationalize it later (e.g. &quot;I learned a lot&quot; without really comparing to the alternative -- a job with formal mentorship processes, and both pay and work/life to allow time for pet projects and formal study).<p>If Philip&#x27;s claim is correct -- and it does match my anecdotal experience -- the way to draw more women into startups would be to make them appealing to rational players. Typically, an early employee ends up with a fraction-of-a-percent equity at exit (and at best, low single-digit percent at joining). Equity is allocated in numbers (5000 shares) rather than percent, in a successful attempt to confuse.<p>Is it a full explanation for 2% vs. 28%? Probably not. Bias is surely part of the equation as well. I have no idea what the split is, but I&#x27;d be shocked if either explained the gap fully, and I&#x27;d be equally shocked if either were insignificant.",1424683681

Some bugs are really hard to understand, reason about, and figure out how to fix. Given a large number of contributors, someone is likely to have just the right mindset and familiarity that the bug is easy for them to understand and fix (it is &quot;shallow&quot; for them).",1424682717

Sorry Atlantic but this is beyond silly. Photons belong to everyone when you get right down to it. So all photographs henceforth are also public domain. Geeez :)",1424682658

Many former xkcd fans think that the average xkcd comic became noticeable less funny somewhere in the low to mid hundreds. Part of it was the novelty being gone but part, I&#x27;d say, really had to do with the quality of the comic&#x27;s writing.<p>The author&#x27;s growing experience and confidence allowed him to pull off ambitious and genuinely imperative things like &quot;Time&quot;, which improved the mean comic, but the median never really recovered.",1424682639

And basically the release is just a snapshot of updates that happen to build together with some nudging and silly letters from Linus.<p>Best would be to just go and use a year.month number. 2014.12, 2014.02, 2015.04. But ultimately, it&#x27;s just a semi-unique identifier with a lot of context that one should be aware of.

To me it looks like a lot of people are nagged on by friends and family before having kids and then taken a lot more seriously afterwards, get more liberties and less questions asked at work, etc. And then .. well then just get on the hype train themselves.

Instead of increased rigor and tools for building better software, we get stuff like this:<p><pre><code>  let obj = {
      [&quot;h&quot;+&quot;ello&quot;]() {
          return &quot;hi&quot;;
      }
  };
  
  obj.hello();

</code></pre>

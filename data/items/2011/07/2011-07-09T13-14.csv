You better start a new language than radically change the current implementation.<p>With regard to my particular choice of ':' there are three solutions:<p>1. pick any of the 100k unicode chars for internal methods but imperative is to differentiate them to freely use attributes and methods as pleased.<p>2. force the compiler and the coder to disambiguate the possible same use as internal method: first assign then use n=a:length(), d={n}<p>3. design the language to use .. as slicer and {a=b} as dictionary assignment.<p>Again, we are talking about design decisions for a new language, not to change the core of an existing language which is not an easy task. That is exactly why language design is not an exact science an very few make it to stardom.",1310219880

Many guitar players will want to use their amps and speakers to get a certain sound. There's still a lot of craft in the front end that can't be learned in hours.<p>Also, a big part of recording is having a producer/engineer, who knows how to capture the essence of a performance in a recording. If you've watched American Idol's last season you could see how high profile musicians and producers zero in on strengths and weaknesses of a performance.<p>I think one thing the Love piece really pointed out is that there is a lot more to getting your music out there than recording. The distribution system is about to be solved but all the other problems, the really big problems, still exist.",1310219857

If a large amount of people are buying the book & asking for a refund, eventually the overhead costs of processing returns & refunds will make it not worth carrying it anymore. This could definitely be abused if someone orchestrated a large purchase & return campaign. I highly doubt merchandisers want to get into the business of arbitration over the merits of the merchandise with their customers. Although there are less customer service inclined companies that make a business out of selling bad merchandise & haggling with the customer about returns, but that's not Amazon's business. They will probably just follow the money & if something is controversial they're not going to take a hit on their profits to stand up for it.",1310219528

Most of the other abuses are related to the review system. There are so many fake and spiteful reviews, that in many cases it's really hard to judge a book based on the reviews.<p>I absolutely love Amazon, but they need preventive measures against these forms of manipulation.<p>For example:<p>- Prevent people who haven't bought the book from Amazon to leave a review. People may still abuse the review system, but it will be less people, and they'll make the author and publisher slightly richer in the process.<p>- If you complain about a book not being as good as advertised, you need to provide proof. Explain in detail what is wrong with it, and provide photographic proof, a scan, or send the book back for inspection. Issue a refund by all means, but don't just trust them and pull the book from the shelves.<p>Right now, anyone could tank any new book published on Amazon with very little work on their part.",1310219156

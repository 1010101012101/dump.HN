1236719,comment,1236570,1236570,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"<i>an undervalued currency shifts domestic demand away from imported goods to domestically-produced goods, and so increases domestic employment</i><p>This isn't necessarily true. Given that labor is a scarce resource, and that a worker chooses him employment on the offered compensation, increasing demand for domestically-manufactured goods may <i>shift</i> employment to manufacturing, and away from pursuits that may be more productive in the big picture (by way of the law of Comparative Advantage).<p>To answer the question posed by the article, here's a way to raise the US savings rate: don't penalize savings (i.e., investment) so heavily. The scheduled increase in the tax rate for capital gains, and the double-taxation on dividends (viz the tax on corporate earnings, which also happens to be one of the highest in the world) make the potential gains from savings lower. If the incentive to save is lower, then less will be saved. Hence, if you want to increase savings, then you must decrease the penalty.<p>The OP acknowledges this: <i>like it or not, if you want Americans to save more you must agree that either it must make production relatively easier, or consumption relatively more difficult, or both</i>.<p>A greater incentive to invest is the same thing as saying ""make production easier"". Investments will wind up going toward a better answer than something else -- else why would anyone want to do it. It'll pay for a new, more efficient factory, or a new business that builds a better product, etc.<p>In essence, the OP is arguing to <i>hobble</i> production as a way to let savings catch up. It seems to me that allowing production to improve through more investing would be the better approach.<p>I'm always wary of policies being built on the basis of arguments from Krugman. He's a brilliant economist, but he's parlaying on top of that to make arguments for specific policies, and he's really bad at that part. Economics is value neutral, and doesn't tell us directly what we ought to do in the world; it just illuminates the choices. Krugman blurs this line, pretending that economics actually does lead to policy. And he's even willing to compromise his economics to make an argument -- see <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703915204575103720332317434.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870391520457510...</a>",1270223396

This guy is supposed to be Steve Jobs and he's interviewing a guy in a suit who works for IBM.<p>I can't find the quote; but this was funny -- From wikipedia:<p>Steve Jobs indirectly commented on the film during a practical joke at the 1999 Macworld Expo. This involved actor Noah Wyle (who portrays Jobs in the film). Wyle impersonates Jobs during the keynote speech, something which only becomes apparent when Jobs himself appears on the stage (to the wild applause of the audience). He corrects Wyle's interpretation of him and tells the audience that he ""invited [Wyle] here today so he could see how I really act and plus because he's a better me than me."" Wyle responds, ""Thank you, thank you, I'm just glad you're not mad about the movie."" Jobs laughs and states, ""What? Me upset? Hey it's just a movie. But you know if you do want to make things right you could get me a little part on E.R."" Then as Noah Wyle goes away, he turns and asks Steve ""Are you still a virgin?"" quoting a part of the film where Steve asks this to a guy who is being interviewed.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley</a>",1270223287

However pesticides are not the problem, it's how they're used which is the problem. No pesticide should be used when the crop is flowering and it requires pollination, this is just flat-out common sense which is being ignored by the farming industry.<p>The problem is that farmers are opting for a lower maintenance cost at a major increased risk of full-out crop failure. However, with government subsidise to support farms that have catastrophic crop failures there is little incentive for the farmers to change their practices.<p>Example: It would be like everyone using candles and oil lamps to light their houses and when a fire eventually starts by one and burns down a town house complex, the government steps in and pays everyone to rebuild their houses. No one is going to stop using the candles and oil lamps until their houses stop being rebuilt for them. This is what happens for many farmers globally. Most of the US farm subsidies goes directly to supporting farmers with failed crops, a fair whack likely of which were caused by improper pesticide usage.<p>Pesticides can be applied directly to the soil to destroy grubs and mites. They can then be applied during the leafing stages of the plant growth to kill off butterflies and such laying eggs that become caterpillars and such. Next it can be pollinated a month to a few days (for a fast acting pesticide) before the crop flowers. Finally you can pesticide again once the pollination is complete.<p>The biggest problem with pesticides is that certain varieties infect the food (the pesticide grain size is equal to a pollen grain, so it attaches to the bee and works its way into their food supply). These pesticides can be dangerous for months to bees, but more dangerously can prevent new workers and drones from being born and can kill the hive by attrition.<p>Static hives for a responsible farmer is the ideal. The farmers would then know more about their crops as a whole by knowing more about the pollinators that support them. It really is a common sense approach, a farmer should know the most about their crops than anyone else and the honeybee is an integral part of their crops in the quantities they want to grow.",1270220794

It stops US companies that rely on government provided infrastructure from shirking their financial obligations.<p>If that's too much to ask they can move to one of their tax havens that has little infrastructure and install their own electricity, plumbing, roads, and schools. But they won't do that. They'll bitch about this law for a while, pay their taxes and get on with it.<p>This is little more than complaining about a tax loophole that was suddenly closed. The common man on the street already pays 15-25% in taxes, why corporations think they would stay exempt makes me shake my head.",1270220489

I don't know if I am not looking hard enough or I just can't browse more than that what the app store app shows. I can search for an app, but I have to know the name of the app for that. So for me, if the app does not show in the app store app links, then the app pretty much does not exist.<p>If I do want a particular application, I search Google first than the app store. Most probably some one has already gone through the pains of finding an app and has talked about it online.<p>So discovery problem exists for app consumers as well. And there in lies a startup idea in app discovery but I wonder how Apple/Google would allow that.",1345096784

4390066,comment,4388679,4388679,1,0,jorleif,,,"An e-commerce concept I believe could work wonderfully is serving markets ""near"" those served by traditional shopping. For example, when buying furniture, there is either the traditional way of buying a ready made piece cheaply (e.g. IKEA), or get exactly what you want from an artisan very expensively. What if you could get something that is very much like the ready-made piece, but with something changed, e.g. width, depth, material etc?<p>One could have a showroom and a ready made collection of items, but allow each customer to do some level of personalization. The parts would then be shipped in IKEA style brown boxes, with the pieces cut automatically to shape with CNC machinery. In that way, you could get to a price point where custom made is competitive.<p>Similarly one could perhaps sell clothes with similar concepts where the user constructs the piece of clothing online (e.g. pick collar style, change coloring etc.). I at least always find clothes that are great except 1) They don't quite fit 2) I dislike a particular detail, but there is no way to fix this in the brick and mortar model.",1345096238

I found power socket in the floor near the phone booth, and plugged in my laptop. After some time security guy came and told me that I shouldn't do that.\nSo when I was passing to the plain, they looked through all stuff from my luggage. Then they apologized ""for the mess""",1237631287

What would happen if you published every small piece of research that journals would accept, and blogged or self published the rest?<p>You might not be the first one to publish results, but you could reasonably claim that anybody that scooped you would be basing their experiment almost entirely off of yours, so it would be somewhat of a derivative work. And if you released a details on your experimental plan, I think that a scientist would have to design a new experiment if he wanted to say that he wasn't just testing your hypothesis.<p>And I think that even if someone did try to scoop you, you would have claim to enough original research to get a phd.<p>This strategy might cause you to change your thesis some. But if you are worried about getting scooped, it might be beneficial to release as quickly as possible to lay claim to as much research as possible.<p>I'm just comparing it to the patent system. Companies don't want their ip infringed, so they file as many patents as possible to get legal rights to their ip.",1237631152

All driven by Moore's Law.<p>A great deal of compsci seems to be like this (even including new ways of multiplying numbers) - not surprising, since Moore's Law dwarfs all other forces. No other industry has anything anywhere near comparable.<p>This can be used predictively: what obviously great but ridiculously infeasible idea will Moore's Law soon make feasible?<p>Examples: spherical TV (you sit inside); golf-swing analysis by brute-force matching with 3D recordings of every possible swing (to arbitrary resolution); literal recording and playback of 3D cerebral cortex activity (to arbitrary precision).",1237631121

When you are serving millions of users, that mantra quickly becomes expensive and hard to maintain.<p>They tried this in 2007, and still use ROR in limited capabilities (for some tools).<p>Example two:\nEncoding video for potentially hundreds type of formats, for thousands of users at the same time. This is on demand video serving to customers where they have to scale in a two dimensional way (both users, and video formats).  Even not trendy among many people in here, Java has one of the best and most advanced multi threading capabilities out there, especially with Java 6. So, they stuck with java for this part of functionality, and actually using Ror only for the wap front end.<p>Example 3:\nAny custom search engine, api engine, anything that doesn't fit the CRUD mantra.<p>Sure you can modify Rails and get it to work for all the above examples, but it will be probably a poor fit for it.  A different technology/framework, or just build your own web app without a full blown framework are better choices.<p>I hate it, when many people equate Web Apps with CRUD Apps, which I think it is a mistake.",1237630742

I'd really like to pay for the service, but what I REALLY need is:<p>1) Run several low user tests (200-300) to tweak server settings, app code, etc.  \n2) Then run one or two big tests (1000+) just once to see the results.<p>I MIGHT need this at most once a month.  That just isn't worth $200 per month.  I'd much prefer a subscription for the lower levels of consistent use, and then be able to purchase an additional once-off very large test for maybe $10-20 each.",1237630565

She acknowledged that Google was successful in terms of market share.<p>She was just questioning their refusal to run certain ads. Adwords had been implemented, but Google was making more money off of customizing intrasite search tools for large corporations.<p>Sure, you can blame her for not seeing adwords as being disruptive and predicting a potential for huge profits. But it is so much easier to discern a disruptive technology as being successful once it starts making large amounts of money.",1237629700

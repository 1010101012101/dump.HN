I've seen very low numbers move Optimal Layout to close to the top of the category: e.g 5 sales in Canada placed it at #5 in the top paid utilities.<p>In the US Optimal Layout hit #4 in the top paid utilities and #40 top paid overall with 82 units sold in a day.<p>For the free apps, WindowFlow was the best performer getting the most downloads in Japan & France (for some reason) hitting the number 1 spot in both store with about 700 downloads a day.
Neither of these translated into many sales for Optimal Layout, but it was just great to have lots of people trying out the apps.<p>So overall it's not a big market yet, being a part of bundle like MacUpdate or MacHeist delivers access to a much bigger market (40,000+ in 2 weeks) but it's relatively steadyand only going to get bigger.<p>I'll revive my blog soon and post a more detailed analysis of how I see it playing out.<p>[1]WindowFlow: <a href=""http://most-advantageous.com/windowflow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://most-advantageous.com/windowflow/</a><p>[2]Window Keys: <a href=""http://most-advantageous.com/window-keys/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://most-advantageous.com/window-keys/</a><p>[3]Optimal Layout: <a href=""http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout</a>",1304718487

A lot of the core components of government are subject to well-known areas of market failure, examples include a well-regulated militia and the justice system.<p>Gov't is a tool that can be used for good or for evil. I'm also with Lord Acton in my belief that power corrupts. Therefore I tend to think that the responsible role of government is very limited in scope. I'm of the opinion that the budgets of gov't in G8 states could be slashed by 75% to 90% whilst providing a major boost to the economy.<p>To cut beyond that would involve cutting services that are subject to market failure in which we'd end up destroying a lot of the value in our governing institutions.<p>One of the most effective things we could do to bring about these changes in a realistic manner is to setup Special Economic Zones or something like that where the normal rules of society do not apply and instead we'd use a more liberal set of rules. Perhaps we could find a smaller city with overwhelming popular support for these rules. Or an uninhabited area that capital could flow into to build the infrastructure from the ground up. Basically use a scientific approach to government where we run experiments to see what the effect of various rules are.<p>Ultimately I could be wrong and a gov't that allocates 50% of the resources in an economy provides better allocation than the market could achieve but I tend to doubt it.",1304717433

Even though we require users to place the leaf on a white background, this is still a very tough problem because of lighting, shadows, viewpoint, blur, focus, etc. We've tried all published segmentation algorithms and nothing works. We wrote our own, using EM on the HSV colorspace as the basis for it (plus lots of heuristics for leaves). It works okay, but it definitely needs the most work.<p>2. Extract some features from the contour of the leaf. We use histograms of curvature over scale. The idea is that some leaves have the same rough shape, but differ at a fine scale (e.g., serrated vs. smooth leaves). Others are similar at a fine-scale but look quite different overall. To distinguish all of these cases, we estimate ""curvature at a scale"" at each point on the contour and build a histogram of curvature values. We then repeat this at coarser and coarser scales and concatenate all histograms together to get a large feature vector.<p>3. Recognition/matching: We use a simple nearest-neighbors classifier to match the feature vectors to our ground-truth database of labeled leaves. We return the top 20 ranked species or so.",1304716749

I've argued the exact argument the author does many times before and got similar responses, it seems to be hard to convey the power of RAII to people who haven't practiced it before. The meaning of RAII is that you can tie a resource to the lifetime of an object, in an environment where the object gets destroyed deterministically. There are two practical uses: 1) You can hide the fact an object is holding a resource from users of the object. 2) You can leverage the power of objects within the language and apply it to resources. The part regarding languages allowing something that might look similar with syntactic sugar didn't convey it's message very well. The syntactic sugar other languages are introducing is great on its own, but it's inferior to the object based approach since it doesn't allow (1) nor (2). It's annoying that languages with garbage collection support have gained a lot of attention solely due to the fact that you don't have to worry about freeing memory, while languages with RAII support in which you basically don't have to <i>worry</i> about freeing any resource, got none.",1304716321

They could send out a press release on a pay-for-PR service like Business Wire claiming (accuately!) that they raised the same as Facebook's seed round, too.<p>For every Google/Facebook out of Google/Facebook-sized seed rounds, there're hordes of non-Googles.<p>> Look at his team of advisers and the technology.<p>I'm trying, and the website is miserable. More misleading, too - they say ""CNBC announcement"" to gain credibility on all their ""news"" items, but they paid to have those announcements placed there. The groundbreaking techs and visionaries they claim don't have much available on them outside of these paid PR pieces.",1304716226

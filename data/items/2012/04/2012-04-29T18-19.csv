Hence a disproportionate amount of the money and (VC manufactured) media is focusing on the latter. And these less/non-innovative companies can only match the returns of a successful innovation based business in a bubble/greater-fool environment. So both the lack of innovation and the bubble are being caused by these financial firms.<p>This seems plausible to me (as an outsider). I would say more that we are seeing this as a direct result of the money looking for returns post real-estate bubble burst. Smart money doesn't seem to chase bubbles, but create them.<p>The lack of innovation becomes simply the opportunity cost of an investment bubble.<p>What's unfortunate is that I bet there are 10's maybe 100's of people like Elon Musk looking to get funding for their ideas but are being over looked by these same firms.",1335725999

I think it was some sort of rule governing what bar-licensed lawyers can and cannot do or what an organization of lawyers can do. It's one of those rules that is like Rule #1 of the Screen Actors Guild. The person to ask about it is Marcel Leonardi.<p>Marcel is one of the few lawyers in Brazil genuinely proactive with respect to internet rights in Brazil. A few years ago he spent some time interning at the EFF in the US via a grant given to him by Google. He is now part of Google's general council in Brazil and AFAIK still works largely on issues of internet rights.<p>The following is his first article on the his experience at the EFF and the possibility of founding such an organization in Brazil. However this article was written before he encountered these legal hurdles. I don't know if he wrote specifically about the legal hurdles or if we simply discussed them in person over lunch.<p><a href=""http://leonardi.adv.br/2010/01/eff-minha-experiencia-e-as-possibilidades-de-uma-entidade-similar-no-brasil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leonardi.adv.br/2010/01/eff-minha-experiencia-e-as-po...</a><p>If you want to know more or want to get involved, I'd contact him, since he can better explain the legal hurdles to creating an analogous organization in Brazil.",1335725900

    return unescape(encodeURIComponent(string));

3906662,comment,3906253,3906500,5,0,lambda,,,"Did you read the article, including the part about Asian text? Like it or not, most text these days is embedded in markup languages like XML or HTML, in which all of the markup is within the ASCII range. This, coupled with the fact that UTF-8 gives you a factor of 2 savings over UTF-16 for the ASCII range, while only a factor of 1.5 increase over UTF-16 for CJK characters, means that for much text (such as anything on the Web), UTF-8 is actually smaller than UTF-16 even for CJK text.<p>Yes, ASCII is obviously too US centric; you can't encode any writing systems other than the Roman alphabet in ASCII. However, that's not at question here. The question is, which Unicode encoding should you use, so you can represent all writing systems in a single encoding. And the major contenders are UTF-8 and UTF-16. The point of this article is, for that purpose, UTF-8 is a far better choice.<p>> Also, if there's variable length encoding why can't we just do a proper way and improve size for the same computational cost?<p>What do you mean by a ""proper way""? If size is what you care about, just compress your data. Compression will do a lot better for a much wider range of data than some clever encoding will. UTF-8 is a carefully constructed encoding designed to meet several design criteria. For instance, you could get better size for a wider range of character sets by having a single byte to represent switching between character sets; so you could use that byte, and then a whole bunch of 2 byte CJK characters. But that would defeat one of the design goals of UTF-8, which is to be self synchronizing. That means that if you get a partial sequence (such as a sequence that has been truncated), you can start decoding the characters after a fixed number of bytes. In the case of UTF-8, you will never have to go more than 3 bytes before you can start decoding again. In my hypothetical scheme where certain symbols were used to switch between character sets, you would not be able to interpret anything until you found the next such symbol. This makes UTF-8 more robust in the face of errors.<p>Another design goal of UTF-8 was to be backwards-compatible with ASCII. Like it or not, ASCII has been the standard encoding for decades, and there is a lot of text in ASCII and a lot of software that uses ASCII delimiters and the like.<p>So, while it would be possible, in theory, to define a character encoding that is more ""fair"" than UTF-8, that ignores many of the other goals of the design of UTF-8. And UTF-8 is widely supported and used (it is the most popular encoding on the Web, even in places like Japan, and a close second in China), while a new encoding would require another large, global, and painful transition process to introduce.",1335725740

Imo, fundamentally most of the issues worth writing about have to do with systems more than individual actors. But the only way to analyze a system in a way that people will read is to weave a narrative through it.<p>I personally prefer more systems-centric journalism myself, which focuses on how economics/law/etc. interacts rather than tracing some particular person/company/story, but it rarely appears outside of specialist journals.

Furthermore, a particular ISP can decide to use its DNS servers as a mechanism for censorship.</i><p>I think this is a little naive. Let's say you want to fix this, what could you do? Well, you could sign the responses; that would prevent hijacking, but it wouldn't stop the ISP from returning SERVFAIL, since the server could <i>really</i> be unavailable.<p>Well, then you could use another DNS server, and encrypt the queries so that the ISP has no idea what's being queried (and therefore can't do selective censoring). But now you've replaced one single point of censorship for another.<p>You could then send queries to multiple DNS servers simultaneously, so that no single server can censor.<p>Now think of all the latency added by that system, and which is useless because the ISP can wait for the DNS to resolve and then drop the HTTP request to that host.<p>You could make the ISP a dumb pipe by using a VPN, but now you've gone back to replacing an evil for another.<p>Eventually, to really fix the problem you'd need a Tor like system with anonymity, dynamic routing and hash-based addresses, but that's extremely inefficient and complete overblown for vast, vast majority of cases unless you're in a dictatorship.",1335725362

Before the 1600s, science was largely done by wealthy people who had large enough houses to have a laboratory in. Scientific results weren't publicly shared; at best they were shared between the experimenter and a few of his/her friends, who communicated by private letters.<p>In the late 1600s, the first journal was founded, which meant that it became the norm for all scientific results to be shared publicly. This era coincided with the birth of the Scientific Revolution, which was an incredible flourishing of scientific thinking, that formed the basis of modern science.<p>I think that with a much more connected scientific community, that operated more as a global brain, rather than relatively disconnected nodes, scientific progress could double.

For example, people seem to have the idea that before Charles Darwin, biology was in a dark age without any ideas other than intelligent design or some such. Well, no, Darwin was actually relatively unoriginal in his ideas about evolution, which was already commonplace in biological circles. He really just added a bit of sciency-but-not-quite-scientific rigor and coined the term ""natural selection"", then got famous for it.<p>I know several drastically unsuccessful people who exhibit the traits in this article.

I wanted to spend more time on that in the article, but didn't because I didn't want to make the article longer. I think the ability to share and ask questions about data really has enormous potential to drive science forward. The fact that enormous amounts of scientific data remains private to the lab, and not shared, is really a big loss to science. It's going to be very exciting as that data starts getting shared more.<p>The key to making that happen is disrupting the credit system. Right now scientists aren't incentivized to curate and share their data, so they don't put in the work to do it. You can't put data-sets on your resume, much like you can't put blog posts, or anything that is not a paper. As soon as scientists start getting credit for sharing data-sets, I think we'll start to see it happen.<p>Similar points apply, as you mention, to instant distribution. Instant distribution will happen more as scientists start getting credit for scientific ideas that they distribute instantly. You are already seeing some disruption to the credit system. In the last 5-10 years, since citation counts have been made publicly available by Google Scholar, citation counts have started to play a much larger role in resource allocation decisions, e.g. decisions by hiring committees and grant committees. I did my PhD at Oxford in philosophy from 2001-2007, and remained involved with some of the hiring decisions at the Oxford philosophy department until 2011, and it's been very interesting to watch the increased influence, over those years, of citation counts in hiring decisions.<p>Citation counts aren't perfect, but they are another signal. Hiring committees, I have experienced, are desperate for more signals that they can take into account when comparing candidates. Comparing candidates is a tough job. As with any signal, to wield it properly, you need to know its pros and cons. Fundamentally what the community is looking for here is a variety of signals that show how much a highly respected chunk of the scientific community has interacted with a piece of your content, and found it useful.<p>To get data-sets, and other media, to attract scientific credit, we need to develop metrics that demonstrate the traction that those pieces of media are getting in highly respected parts of the scientific community.

It talks about a scenario where the soldiers are <i>tricked</i> into firing the missiles.<p>Re: doing more damage if they dropped bowling balls from the roof, that's just flat out wrong. For a start, the missiles travel at 2800 miles per hour which is an order of magnitude higher than the terminal velocity of a bowling ball, so the impact alone would be much more damaging. Secondly, the warhead is housed in a tungsten shell which is designed to fragment on impact to maximise damage inside the target. And then there are the explosives as well.

3906547,comment,3906253,3906405,24,0,lambda,,,"> One of the advantages of UTF-16 is knowing right away it's UTF-16 as opposed to deciding if it's UTF-8/ASCII/other encoding. Sure, for transmission it's a waste of space (still, text for today's computer capabilities is a non issue even if using UTF-32)<p>First of all, if you don't know the encoding, then you don't know the encoding, and you will need to figure out if it's UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO-8859-1, etc. If you happen to know that it's UTF-16, you still need to figure out if it's UTF-16BE or LE.<p>> ""It's not fixed width"" But for most text, it is.<p>This is a dangerous way of thinking. One of the big problems with UTF-16 is that for most text, it is fixed width; so many people make that assumption, and you never notice the problem until someone tries to use an obscure script or an emoji character. This means that bugs can easily be lurking under the surface; while with UTF-8, anything besides straight ASCII will break if you assume fixed width, making it much more obvious.<p>> Sure, you can do UTF-32 and it may not be a bad idea (today)<p>UTF-32 isn't really meaningfully fixed width either. Sure, each code point is represented in a fixed number of bytes, but code points are not necessarily the interesting unit you want to index by. A glyph could be composed of several code points. Most of the time, you actually want to deal with text in longer units such as words or tokens, which are going to be variable width anyhow. The actual width of individual code points is only really of interest to low-level text processing libraries, not most applications.",1335722852

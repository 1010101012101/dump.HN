For the first 3 - 6 months, focus on building a portfolio of good work and references. For the next 6 - 12 months, focus on steadily increasing your rates/prices and bring on-board one or two technical people to help you on a freelance basis. You must continue to do sales and ask for referrals. The next 12 - 24 months, focus on scaling your services and capacity.

It still baffles me that people would voluntarily work at implementing something like PRISM - I would literally quit my job over something like this; similar considerations have popped up in the research I do for my Masters thesis - but ethics is definitely something we would talk more about.",1386194349

If the service buyers who want their goods ship do not allow their items to be inspected by the travelers, I recommend the travelers NOT to take the items with them as it is not worth the risk.<p>This is somewhat eliminate service buyers privacy, but from what I understand, most people who are using this service would buy items that are either cost too much in their local market or item availability is rare to none.  Example, PS4 or Xbox One.  iPhones, iPad, used laptops, bike parts, electronics, limited edition items, etc.<p>People who are using this service are also people in emerging markets with corrupted customs system (that delays items clearance or must bribe to get the item cleared), so with travelers carrying the items with them and declare as personal items, then it will make the shipping faster vs ship it traditional way (FedEx, DHL).  Example can be seen for most electronics items like phones or laptops.<p>Everyone knows that in Asia especially, customs can be troublesome (i.e Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Thailand).  Items are always backlogged and if you are shipping to remote city, it will take weeks to ship the item.

So it&#x27;s actually a case in point that the &quot;preferred&quot; colours for children are somewhat more stable.<p>But if you look at adult&#x27;s clothing, colours change every year, and every <i>season</i>. Pink shirts for men drop in and out of fashion. Models change every few years from big to slim to long to low to skinny<p>(seriously would <i>anyone</i> buy skinny jeans if they still offered a decent selection of boot-cuts at general clothing stores? ;) I&#x27;m kidding, I bet there&#x27;s people that actually like the model)<p>I don&#x27;t have my bookmarks here (maybe someone else can provide a link?), but I once read there was some old French lady in the fashion industry that would actually just pick and decide the &quot;in fashion&quot; colours for the next season, some influential big brands would just follow her direction, cheaper brands would copy the style, and that was that then. I read about it because she passed away a few years ago, but I bet they found a replacement fashion colour oracle soon enough.",1386193878

You feel like this &quot;could open the doors to greater community contribution, encouraging larger groups of people to work together to solve the problems more quickly&quot;. The argument makes sense: if jailbreaking were secretive and closed (which is a bullet you dodged, btw: on Android, where bounties are common, jailbreak tools are not only often closed source but techniques are hoarded and under-described so as to win more bounties <- you actually <i>need</i> this open source clause to not fall into the obvious trap) people are not in a position to learn how all of the systems of Apple&#x27;s device work in a way that would let them later build their own tools.<p>Would it surprise you to find out that most of the code in a jailbreak is already open source, and that the only parts that are not tend to be the GUI and the specific exploit technique for that one specific version of iOS?<p>- All of the libraries that are use to connect to the device in its normal mode are licensed under LGPL (they are part of a suite called libimobiledevice, which was primarily developed by members of the iPhone Dev Team, and now maintained by nikias from evad3rs).<p>- The libraries used to talk to the device in recovery and DFU mode are open source and licensed under GPL (developed by posixninja, who has been maintaining them recently under the openjailbreak project).<p>- The libraries used to decrypt and modify image files (kernels, devices trees, disks, and bootloaders) has been open source for years (developed and maintained by planetbeing from evad3rs). The same developer (planetbeing) has released a number of utility libraries like this, including ones to download portions of IPSW files from Apple&#x27;s servers without having to download the whole file (this is why jailbreaks never need to distribute copyrighted content). All of this code is under GPL.<p>It is thereby not just useless but insulting that in your e-mail you make the point that &quot;the jailbreaking teams\nare not an island—they rely heavily on FOSS software in their work&quot;: the people who build these tools (which again, does not include myself) quite often release code for large or critical parts of their work, and almost exclusively do so under &quot;free software&quot; licenses.<p>In fact, many previous jailbreak tools have been or have become open source, and currently the tool to jailbreak the iPhone 4 on iOS 7 (opensn0w) is itself open source (under GPL). Now, one thing that is really interesting here: this project (which has now existed for years) actually tried to crowd fund itself (which, to be 100% clear, doesn&#x27;t cause the same kinds of issues as a third-party bounty program) and failed. Out of its $3,000 it got $30.<p><a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/opensn0w\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.indiegogo.com/opensn0w</a><p>This, of course, flies in the face of your comment that the goal is to set a precedent of jailbreaks being open source: and in case you think I&#x27;m playing up one example, the iOS 4 jailbreaks from comex were open source as well; the source code for both JailbreakMe 2.0 and JailbreakMe 3.0 were released (I believe fairly soon after the jailbreak, but clearly as this was all years ago &quot;soon&quot; is relative: there are tons of open source examples).<p><a href=\"http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/07/19/jailbreakme-now-open-source/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/07/19/jailbreakme-now-open...</a><p>The team behind the tool greenpois0n (which includes the aforementioned posixninja) also open sourced much of their work as &quot;syringe&quot;. The opensn0w tool in fact uses a lot of this code, as have been a number of third-party tools based on this older limera1n exploit (which, interestingly enough, was itself released to the community by geohot giving everyone a few lines of source code for how to implement it, as he wanted people to use that exploit instead of SHAtter).<p><a href=\"http://www.ijailbreak.com/applications/greenpois0n-jailbreak-now-open-source/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ijailbreak.com/applications/greenpois0n-jailbreak...</a><p>The argument that people are somehow not able to learn how to jailbreak things because nothing is open source thereby doesn&#x27;t make any sense even on the face of it; again: the only things that tend to be closed source are GUIs and transient one-off device-specific techniques. The main reason these things tend to be closed source is that our community has a serious problem with scams: people like to try to charge people for jailbreak tools or claim they have tools that work in places they don&#x27;t; everyone wants to &quot;build a jailbreak&quot;, but in practice people just want &quot;to take someone&#x27;s tool, change the GUI, claim it works better than it does, and then charge $20 for it&quot;.<p>In your mind, this seems to be related to the idea that &quot;I don&#x27;t want them making money when I&#x27;m not making money: I want to make the money, so that&#x27;s why it is closed source&quot;, but <i>that just demonstrates you are seeing this through the eyes of the wrong kinds of incentives</i>. You say that &quot;getting financial support up front reduces the perverse incentive to keep the source closed so that other groups cannot profit from it without having built it&quot;, but in fact that doesn&#x27;t change that users will get scammed and lose money: the argument made by the jailbreak teams has never been &quot;you should give money to us, not them&quot;, but instead &quot;jailbreaks should be free&quot;. It is simply clear that you don&#x27;t understand the incentive structures already in place in this community, even while you feel like you want to change them.<p>You might then argue that it is horrible that these techniques are hidden, but that itself could not be further from the case: the people who build these jailbreaks generally give talks about how the jailbreaks work at conferences around the world, and they are well documented in the security community through everything from articles on websites to entire books. (At JailbreakCon, Nikias from evad3rs gave an hour and a half long presentation on exactly how the iOS 6 jailbreak worked as part of a time slot that was only a half an hour long, a story which I continue to find absolutely hilarious ;P.)<p>Really, the only sentence I can come up with from your e-mail that has some weight behind it is the argument that &quot;users of such a jailbreak will be able to audit the changes made to the firmware of one of their most important pieces of hardware&quot;. FWIW, this is a cause that I appreciate.<p>However, you are addressing an audience of people who are primarily getting software from Apple, none of which is itself audited by the community, and which the people you are attacking (and yes: an implication &quot;you can&#x27;t trust these people&quot; is an attack) have demonstrated on numerous occasions is insecure or actively damaging (such as with the various logging and reporting daemons). The modifications made are also fairly easy for people in the community to pull apart: maybe not to you, but to 99.99% of users the source code isn&#x27;t helpful anyway... that doesn&#x27;t mean that results are not able to be &quot;audited&quot;.<p>I feel like the best you could thereby hope for is some kind of &quot;strife&quot; that you want to cause: to pit people against one another, spiting one movement (open hardware) to help another (open software). Open hardware is a much more serious problem that very few people are really fighting for, and iOS jalbreaking is one of the few case examples that can be pointed to when lobbying (such as with Congress, or the Library of Congress) for why these freedoms are important and potentially obtaining laws to guarantee them. It would be an absolute shame to see one of the few weapons we have in that war be sacrificed because you felt that tens of millions of people had incorrectly allocated their trust.",1386192577

6850353,comment,6847955,6849460,1,0,saurik,,,"[Some context for others: when I first was responding to the idea of this bounty program, it was to someone else who had previously been considering working with Elizabeth; I was contacted in a kind of after-the-fact/&quot;FYI&quot; style. This was when the only real information was &quot;bounty for iOS 7 jailbreak&quot;, without most of the extra restrictions that are now in place on the program, such as &quot;open source&quot;. At the time, it for example seemed clear that evad3rs--the group that has been making the jailbreaks for the last two years--was going to get the bounty anyway. I already had started to bring up the incentive structure issues, and managed to get this other person to drop his involvement with the project. My original e-mail to Elizabeth thereby only talked about these issues, which is why this comment has to delve so deeply into the &quot;final&quot; point.]<p>So, your e-mail seems to make four points. The first point, taking up two paragraphs, is related to your career and your project. In these paragraphs, you did not address any of the specific example reasons I could come up with for why you were involved, and if anything simply raised a few more. These paragraphs, however, are largely ignorable.<p>The third point (setting off the second for a minute) was the argument made to attempt to address an incentive change on the side of the people building jailbreaks. This argument hinges on a specific example of a previous bounty, claiming that it did not cause the ramifications I am predicting.<p>> While I am sensitive to your concerns around community incentives, it’s unlikely that our approach will threaten them. For example, when Adafruit created a prize for open Kinect drivers, instead of devolving into a community of mercenaries, it enabled an ecosystem of Kinect hackers to flourish.[1]<p>[1]: \n<a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/11/04/the-open-kinect-project-the-ok-prize-get-1000-bounty-for-kinect-for-xbox-360-open-source-drivers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/11/04/the-open-kinect-pro...</a><p>The problem with this argument is that it is looking at entirely the wrong level: you are claiming that by having the driver for Kinect get constructed, people were able to start hacking on Kinect, causing an ecosystem on the other side of the driver to flourish. We already have that ecosystem on the other side of the jailbreak.<p>Instead, we are looking at the actual construction of the jailbreaks here; the correct analogy is to instead look at the market for construction of drivers for closed video game controllers. What you need to demonstrate is that a &quot;success&quot; for that crowd funding doesn&#x27;t lead the people who were working on that driver to end up with different incentives, or cause other people watching to expect the same (again, in a &quot;success&quot; situation: I know people who work with Kinect, and I&#x27;d never heard the driver was crowd funded, so any community effects would be quite narrow due to the limited reach; likely as it was so little money).<p>FWIW, that people&#x27;s incentives change in these situations is well documented: this isn&#x27;t just my assertion, this is something you can read about in books like &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;. Given that a new jailbreak is needed at least once a year (and in a perfect world, would happen no less than twice a year), this is critical: you are playing an iterative game, and have to think about the ramifications on incentives not immediately, but a few steps ahead.<p>In reality, the community is already anticipating the release of an iOS 7 jailbreak (evad3rs has already publicly stated that they have all the pieces they need and are just working on implementing and finalizing). We (the community of people who use these jailbreaks: I do not build them myself) thereby are not in a position where this bounty is going to change anything: it is just going to change how funds are directed (5%, for example, will be given directly to your new company, rather than all of it to the people who build the tools) and the expectations people have related to them, it isn&#x27;t going to incentive construction of a new community that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>You then had a forth point, the goal of which was to assuage concerns that people leaving contributions would have different expectations. This argument was just &quot;we state this clearly on the website&quot;; <sarcasm>which, as we all know, works out wonderfully in the case of Kickstarter projects: it isn&#x27;t like I&#x27;ve ever heard of people angry that they didn&#x27;t get the thing they wanted, or that it didn&#x27;t work well, as Kickstarter is very clear that they are not a way to preorder products</sarcasm>. You will need to come up with a much stronger argument here... if anything, I think you&#x27;ve just dug a deeper hole ;P.<p>[my comment is apparently too long for Hacker News; given that I often write very very long comments, I&#x27;m really surprised I&#x27;ve never run into this limitation before, and so wonder if it is new ;P. however, this comment is thereby split and I will reply with the rest]",1386192549

After a quick search, questions like this [0] make me think it still isn&#x27;t the case that there is a universal account.<p>The real reason I ask is because I was bummed when they removed the ability to filter by top questions per week or per month [1].

Now, my passwords are alphanumerical jumble, and they&#x27;re usually comprised of an alphanumerical jumble &quot;core&quot; that I memorize and then a site-based or computer-based pre- and suffix.<p>So, let&#x27;s say for example, my current core is &quot;kgA85kjF3&quot;. Then for example, I&#x27;d morph that for my Hacker News account to &quot;ZkgA85kjF39!&quot; and my fileserver as &quot;UkgA85kjF3O2&quot;.

It got worse from there. Through experimentation, I determined that it was <i>indeed</i> the core that was compromised. Any password containing &quot;kgA85kjF3&quot; was compromised.<p>I have no idea how this happened.

6850194,comment,6849223,6849223,39,0,tokenadult,,,"As another comment says, the author of this New York Times article, Carl Zimmer, is a very solid science writer who knows a lot about evolution. I have occasion to discuss human population genetics with psychologists who study behavior genetics, and when population genetics issues come up in those discussions, some of the new discoveries are surprising even to them. It&#x27;s hard for reporters, us, and even the working researchers to keep up with the new findings in human population genetics. I&#x27;ll share a finding here that surprised some researchers I discussed it with this week.<p>The first human genome to be sequenced was that of Craig Venter, who would be called a &quot;white&quot; man in the United States. The second human genome to be sequenced was that of James Watson, who is also regarded as &quot;white&quot; in either the United States or Britain. One of the first dozen or so human genomes to be sequenced was that of Korean scientist Seong-Jin Kim,[1] and his genome, even though &quot;Asian,&quot; is more similar to Venter&#x27;s than Venter&#x27;s is to Watson&#x27;s, and more similar to Watson&#x27;s than Watson&#x27;s is to Venter&#x27;s.[2] Even though lineages are traceable in broad outlines by looking at human genes, there are quite a few human beings who resemble someone in someone else&#x27;s group more than they resemble people in their own group. &quot;The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them. It is also compatible with our finding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population. Thus, caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes.&quot;[3]<p>So what&#x27;s going in these studies of early hominid DNA is that we necessarily have tiny sample sizes, and we actually have no idea how much genetic variation there was in the population we call Neanderthal, how much in the population we call Denisovan, and so on. We will want to sequence as much ancient DNA as we can, and meanwhile sequence more modern human DNA from more people from more places around the world. But we won&#x27;t be able to trace back the ancestry relationships unerringly, no matter what we do.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2009/05/26/gr.092197.109\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2009/05/26/gr.092197.1...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www2.webmatic.it/workO/s/113/pr-1611-file_it-Barbujani%20Pigliucci%20CurrBio.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www2.webmatic.it/workO/s/113/pr-1611-file_it-Barbujan...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.genetics.org/content/176/1/351.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.genetics.org/content/176/1/351.full</a>",1386191337

Absurd for a $0.05 theft of electricity, but a limited sort of absurdity.  The criminal is made to pay a disproportionate amount in restitution for his crime.<p>The second is the cost to the society.  The cost of having a police man arrest someone for a $0.05 theft, jail him, take him to court, and supervise the community service.  Hell, the cost to cash the $50 check for the fine is probably more than $0.05.

I&#x27;m going to disagree with the naysayers who say this is useless. You can partially defang them by pointing out that while this doesn&#x27;t fully test a camera against a human eye, it is a reasonable test on its own merits and generally answers the question that people are <i>actually asking</i> when they ask &quot;what&#x27;s the resolution of the human eye?&quot; (After all, the difference in capabilities goes both ways; sure, human eyes are a great deal more sensitive on many measures, but would someone please show me their eye&#x27;s 10x optical zoom? (Hello to the 2040s!))<p>A further observation that &quot;megapixels&quot; is not useful would be called for, though. We&#x27;re really comparing angular resolution for a certain set of settings. But we can accept &quot;megapixels&quot; as a slang term if we also fix certain other camera parameters to ones common to consumer cameras in the market.<p>3. Using eye charts is a good idea, I think. I&#x27;ve seen comparisons that try to compare rod density on the human eye, but that&#x27;s really hard. I&#x27;d consider adding a note that standardized eye charts measure what humans can <i>really see</i> rather than try to compare two extremely different hardware platforms directly.",1386191237

If somebody had fixed a spelling mistake, would any reasonable project leader just have closed the pull request dismissively? I doubt it.

If they were treated as unrelated concepts then they would not both be serviced by git-checkout, despite sharing an underlying implementation.<p>They are the same thing both in implementation <i>and</i> UI.<p>The various consequences of detached commits and what happens when you try to modify the working tree when there are uncommitted changes are both concepts that permeate all of git.  Handling these things in a graceful manner does not somehow mean that checking out branches or commits are fundamentally different concepts.<p>If you want an example of muddled UI, <i>git-checkout -b</i> is an infinitely better example.  Creating a branch is conceptually unrelated to checking out a branch; git-checkout just provides the -b flag for convenience because typically you want to check out the branch after creating it.  It would likely make more sense to provide a --checkout flag of some sort with git-branch, as creating the branch is the primary operation and checking it out is just a secondary convenience.  <i>That</i> is a decent complaint.<p>If this is the sort of thing <i>honestly</i> that bothers you, then just make a <i>git-changebranch</i> alias for git-checkout, pretend that git-checkout can&#x27;t do branches even though it can do arbitrary commits, and move on with your life.",1386191073

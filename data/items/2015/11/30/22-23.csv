So you&#x27;re making what is a fairly broken process the &#x27;focus&#x27;, which seems pretty odd.<p>Mobile is also feature poor compared to desktop so generally needs less testing.

Generally the fix has been to totally close Dropbox, clear out the Dropbox cache, which is a set of hidden files somewhere (look in their support pages or Google for it) and then re-install the Dropbox application. It more than likely will do a full re-index and this is an absolute pain and CPU hog when it happens. If you have a lot of files, it can day half a day to a full day.<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what happens, but my guess is that somehow an index in it&#x27;s internal database gets corrupted and then it sits in a loop there for some reason whenever it hits that file/folder.<p>We have used Dropbox extensively in our office across Windows & OSX for at least 2 years and have had this periodically (and randomly) happen on some machines.

These include such game changers as Object Oriented Programming, WYSIWYG word processing, Graphical User Interfaces, and Digital Cameras.<p>However it happens, Apple is good at taking R&D, no matter where it originally happened, and creates game changing products out of it.

I don&#x27;t think a description of what it means to remember you are talking to a person was given even though it was claimed that one should do it. If I should be doing it, I need to know what it is. Then, I can see if I am actually doing it, and if I am not, start doing it again. I think it is an entirely reasonable question.<p>>In the context of giving critical feedback, it&#x27;s easy to focus on the problem, the specific area you want to correct, and reduce the person on the other side to just being the cause of the problem.<p>Certainly. People are generally not the causes of problems, so looking there is probably a waste of time. I think the far more effective strategy is working to eliminate the problem and modify processes to ensure that the problem never happens again. Any problem, in a corporate context, is a failing of the entire team, not any individual.<p>>It&#x27;s easy to forget that the developer is a person with a lifetime of experiences different from yours, a different perspective, different strengths and weaknesses, different insecurities, different stuff going on in their personal life.<p>Maybe our difference is on how easy this is.

All you need to do is realize that you are a person with all of those things and that you are not that other person.<p>>I haven&#x27;t been on the receiving end myself, but I have often seen managers give feedback that is belittling and reduces the entire worth of a person to a single mistake.<p>I think it&#x27;s a rampant problem. I guess people just want to blame others rather than make things better? I seem to detect instances of it all the time, that seem to be casually accepted by most. For example, General Motor&#x27;s response to a faulty piece of equipment they were using in their cars was to fire the engineer who designed it.

There was a plan for Perl5 and Perl6 to share a new virtual machine and for there to be some sort of compatibility layer so that Perl6 could run Perl5 code.  However when it started to take decades to complete Perl6, and when it started to become clear that Perl6 was so different from Perl5 that it was essentially a new language, working Perl5 developers started working on Perl5 again and porting as many Perl6 features as possible to Perl5 (although typically not as new minor versions of Perl5, but as modules on CPAN).  So for example we have Moose which brings a lot of the best bits of Perl6 objects to Perl5.  As a result many Perl5 programmers stopped waiting to be saved by Perl6 and just got on with it.  Over time the distance between Perl5 and Perl6 communities grew, despite some efforts at unification, so that now the fact that both languages share the Perl name is a bit silly (in my opinion, but I know that&#x27;s not universally shared).  In fact there&#x27;s been moments of hostility between the communities, over the Perl name and so forth.  So sorry this is confusing to you, you are rightly confused and it saddens me that it happened.  I wish that when it became clear that Perl6 was not replacing Perl5 that we&#x27;d have chosen a new name for Perl6.  Unfortunately the groups running this are not democratically chosen people to represent the Perl community, just people that showed up and did work, so they often don&#x27;t feel or care about the confusion.  What I usually do is consider Perl5 the language and the version is 22 (the current release of Perl5), and I think of Perl6 as being alpha or beta for version zero.  If you consider the number part of the language title it sorta can make some sense.",1448922609

10652355,comment,10651155,10651155,0,0,mceoin,,,"We encountered this “orthagonality” in the early days of SFDevLabs while trying to build a list-based site for navigating the Internet. Our approach to list creation was bookmarking, yet the more we build for the individual, the more we built a siloed product and strayed away from the potential of network effects, which was objective in the first place! (whoops)<p>I’m still fairly-well convinced that list-based sites are superior to google for discovery, and a combined list-site/discovery-engine could be a huge boon for finding new and relevant content on the internet. (Google might be fast, but it is far from pleasant and isn’t great for a “wandering” mindset).<p>Pinterest is the obvious standout here IMO. They nailed the individual use case (I speak to designers and females all the time who use it for vision/inspiration boards), and they leveraged their connected content into what I believe is the best discovery engine for visual-based content online — to put it in a “Facebooky” way, they have structured data, which is immensely valuable. Suffice to say, humans can process and navigate bulk-imagery better than a page full of text, so Pinterest was well-poised to have this effect on the previously non-visual search landscape at the time.<p>Some points I think about:<p>* BIG PICTURE: We’re missing a “site map” of the internet, and a horizontal list site has the potential to provide the navigation experience that we need.<p>* As an experience, the “related” search on google is pitiful; the internet deserves better. (e.g. <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=related:avc.com/+avc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&e...</a>). I think the search experience on a list-based tool will mimic this action pretty closely, but will give a way better result.<p>* Form factor is an issue for content creation. Generating lists from URLs isn’t pleasant on mobile (I haven’t found a satisfying way around this yet), so I suspect the power-users will come from a web-first generation — unless a novel approach to the mobile piece is created and adopted.<p>* Horizontal list sites require a bootstrapping mindset. They’re inherently unprofitable in the early days unless you’re going after product-focused lists, in which case it’s difficult to break out from being nichy/materialist. My prediction is that we’ll keep seeing product-focused lists while in a boom-cycle (Wanelo, canopy.co, kit, etc.), however they will have a hard time breaking out of the consumerist space if those are the origins.<p>* The process of list-building is extremely similar from one vertical to another (bookmarks, music and fashion, for example), so despite the lack of a horizontal product that is a clear winner, I still expect one site will dominate in the long run due to network effects, similar to how Reddit effectively dominated the forum space.<p>* We’re in the midst of a boom-cycle, so the ideas I’m seeing around me all seem to be very money-focused (nothing wrong with that, there’s just a different focus), however I expect a true horizontal list-building site will take a patient long-term approach that will emerge in thriftier times when rent and talent is cheaper and entrepreneurs are freer to try wild ideas.<p>* The technology behind creating and leveraging connected graphs is more approachable than ever (Neo4j & GraphQL come to mind). Powerful “woven” experiences with overlapping content are possible with a fraction of the engineering talent of, say, 5 years ago. I personally think this is an interesting variable to watch, as it could be the bridge between the individual and social use-case that you mention. (Put mildly, we can extract more utility from less content creation).<p>* Community is the key. Slightly contrarian but I see the injection of too much capital as a potential killer of list-based ideas. “Easy money” (if there is such a thing) and not-enough focus on fanaticizing an early user base will be the death knell of all who enter this space.<p>* What is the correct balance between altruism (wikipedia) and narcissism (social products)?<p>- What are the lessons from Delicious? By all accounts, it should have “won” but lost its way somewhere (the acquisition?). Social bookmarking still deserves a better solution.<p>- I think the original list spaces of a horizontal winner will come from an area that is extremely nichy, extremely nerdy, text-heavy and unprofitable (or not obviously profitable). Maybe it’ll start out with poets and researchers and spread from there? The smaller the community, the better, because there’s greater recognition for contribution when everyone knows each other.",1448922436

I wouldn&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s wrong or right, but I find it welcome as it&#x27;s strong, i.e. sticks around, my mind will compare it to real-world situations in the future and figure out over time whether it&#x27;s correct.<p>I think what the image points out is that you&#x27;re ultimately doing your own decisions, for your own benefit, and not doing it for anyone else unless you decide so. And I&#x27;d think that this is correct: I did believe that open source is something to improve the world, and standing against closed-source software, and hence if I saw that open source software was lacking, it felt wrong, and led me in a couple occasions to give strong statements to open source developers, which I guess were received exactly like the negative, demanding inputs criticized here. So I&#x27;m guilty of this myself. So now, while I realize that the other side (the user) wants to be appreciated, too and not doing that will lead to project failure (both of which might be the reason leading to the down votes here), it would be wrong to let that suck out your energy.

Monogamy is only necessary for the female if it will provide her with resources or protection. Monogamy is not necessary for her to get access to sperm--sperm is cheap.

And what was Yahoo? A list of links divided up by category.<p>Google came along and won the game because it&#x27;s better in the world than anyone else at sorting lists of webpages. It&#x27;s so good that it can actually sort them without having anyone ever see them or read them, and that allows them to scale to a level Yahoo couldn&#x27;t even dream of, with better results all the while. Google is the best, technology-enabled list-making service in the world.<p>Now the way most people use Facebook is to see a list of all the stuff their friends have posted about. Originally it was ordered solely by time, but now they have a little more data about what you like to click on and what/who you&#x27;re interested in, and help you out a bit.<p>Twitter is a list of what certain people and organizations you follow are publishing right now.<p>HackerNews and Reddit and ProductHunt are lists of the best X as decided by the community, with a gravity (or 24-hour session) added so the older stuff falls down over time, keeping them fresh.<p>Pinterest, although not a list in the sense that it&#x27;s a vertical ascending/descending list (unless you&#x27;re on a mobile device), is in actuality a list of all the products and photos your friends are gathering into their various collections.<p>The purpose of Yelp and Foursquare is largely to give me a list of places I should go to based on the information provided by my friends or the crowd.<p>In other words, the reason you&#x27;re not seeing lists is because you&#x27;re thinking of &quot;lists&quot; as a two-dimensional object; something in which someone comes in and compiles a list of X and others consume it. In reality this is happening in several ways, there&#x27;s just often a lot more nuance and color than someone coming through to create their own collection.<p>At the end of the day, a list is just a data sort. The Internet is <i>made</i> of lists. The interesting thing, at least in my opinion, is how you accumulate that data and how you sort it. If you define &quot;list-making&quot; as the accumulation and sorting of data, almost every big tech company I can think of is in the list-making business.",1448921598

What follows are some additional thoughts on what that means. But, please don’t let the additional thoughts or the acronym paralyze you. Whatever you do, don’t sit there saying nothing trying to remember what I stands for. For the vast majority of people, the really important thing is to just say what you think.<p>H is for Humble.<p>You can’t care personally or challenge directly if you’re not humble. It’s really hard to care at a personal level about somebody if you feel superior.  When one person feels intrinsically “better” than another, a good relationship is impossible. And, you can’t challenge directly and be open to the reciprocal challenge if you’re not humble enough to realize you may be wrong.<p>The first time a person in a class I was teaching raised his hand asked me how to be humble, I sat there with my mouth open. It was all I could do not to break into the song from the 70’s show HeeHaw. “Oh lord, it’s hard to be humble, when you’re perfect in every way!” How to answer a question like that?? I didn’t take it seriously until about the 20th time somebody asked me. Finally, I realized it was a legitimate question and I needed to give a serious answer.<p>The reason is that criticism does feel arrogant.  How can you feel humble and tell somebody when their work isn’t good enough at the same time? It can feel equally arrogant to tell people when their work is great. I often bristle at praise because it sounds insincere or patronizing or somehow belittling.  When somebody says to me, “I’m so proud of you!”  I think, “Who are you to be proud of me?”  It’s the fear of sounding arrogant that sometimes makes me hesitate to give praise to people properly.<p>Ask questions: I’ve always found it really helpful to offer both criticism and praise in a spirit of inquiry rather than a spirit of self-righteous certainty. When criticizing, I try to keep top of mind the possibility that I may be wrong.  The other person might learn something from my criticism--but it’s equally possible that I will learn something from their rebuttal to my criticism.  Put another way, it’s always made it much easier for me to criticize somebody when I realize there are two benefits to doing so.  One, I may be helping them to fix something that is wrong.  Two, I am giving them an opportunity to fix my opinion, which is wrong. The same goes for praise: if you see something impressive, ask a question. How did you do that? What gave you that idea? Can you teach others to do that? etc. This shows that you are not some godly arbiter of what’s good and what’s bad, but a fellow learner.<p>Power trips you up: Nothing is more corrupting to humility and to giving a damn than formal power. Part of what gives bosses trouble with humility is that they have a little bit of power. Part of what makes it hard for employees to be radically candid with their bosses is the power thing. Part of Google’s management genius was removing that power. But even if you don’t work at a company like Google, you can remember that you can easily get another job, and so find the courage to speak your mind.<p>Don’t let yourself get too mad/hungry/tired: Most people find it harder to be humble when they’re mad, hungry, or tired.If I focus on managing my emotions it’s easier for me to prevent my ego from getting the better of me.<p>“Left hand column” and “ladder of inference:” Chris Argyris developed a method useful for keeping oneself humble called the “left hand column.” The idea here is that what you are really thinking, which is often arrogant, leaks out into what you say.  If you can be more conscious of what you’re thinking, and can adjust it, you can probably find a productive way to address it.  For example if you are thinking, ‘Joe is a bozo and shouldn’t even be at the company,’ you’re not likely to be “HIP” when you criticize the typos you saw in his last ten presentations.  However, if you realize what you’re thinking and dig a little deeper, you may realize that you’ve hit the bozo bit too fast.  Or, you may realize you should be helping Joe to find a job that’s a better fit for him, not coaching him in a role he’ll never be great at.  Argyris also came up with the  “ladder of inference” tool.  This can help you be humble enough to question your assumptions and get out of recursive loops as you judge people.<p>“Ontological Humility:” Fred Kofman wrote a great chapter called Ontological Humility in his book Conscious Business.  The idea is that when you remember your criticism may be wrong, it can help you to challenge others in a way that invites a reciprocal challenge, and helps you see things from the other person’s point of view.",1448921208

My son used to go to the local day care that had stellar reviews on Yelp - 4 or 5 stars with a single 3 star review. I knew the vast majority of reviewers because they were parents whom I&#x27;ve met through kids birthday parties and the like. Then one day Yelp called the owner of the daycare asking her if she&#x27;d like to purchase some advertising. She already had plenty of business so she politely declined. A week later 20-something reviews went into &quot;Not Recommended&quot; category, effectively becoming hidden. The only review that remained on the site for the business was the single 3-star review. This is effectively extortion. In other words yelp won&#x27;t fabricate reviews, it&#x27;ll just selectively filter reviews if you don&#x27;t pay them to pain a worse picture of your business.",1448920858

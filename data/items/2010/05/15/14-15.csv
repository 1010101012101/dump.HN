Four years ago when I moved to the US I went from the situation of having an apartment full of stuff to having two suitcases full of stuff. I acquired an apartment where the old tenants were happy to leave behind a crummy couch and a mattress on the floor, did a quick run to Walmart to pick up a minimalist set of kitchenware and bedding, bought a bike to get around town, and I was pretty much in the supposedly-blessed state of having the mininal possible amount of stuff.<p>It wasn't that great. It was just limiting and depressing.<p>Four years of stuff-acquisition later I now have just about the right amount of stuff. Some stuff (like half the stuff in my kitchen) I seldom use, but it's there in case I need it. Other stuff is completely useless, but I like having it around because it looks nice. I own four frypans, which is probably at least twice as many as I need, but y'know what? Contrary to what you read in many of these articles, having the extra two frypans doesn't cause me any distress.<p>So while I'd never advocate anyone buying stuff just for the sake of buying stuff, nor buying stuff that they can't afford, I really don't see any problem with having some stuff, nor any great advantage to getting rid of stuff.

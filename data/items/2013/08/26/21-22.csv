6280148,comment,6276153,6279805,1,0,saraid216,,,"> Microeconomics is a counter-example. There&#x27;s also game theory and personal psychology. I guess it depends on what you consider useful.<p>I won&#x27;t get bothered over the term &quot;useful&quot;. I mean &quot;non-trivial&quot;, basically. It&#x27;s true that microeconomics, game theory, and personal psychology discuss individual-level actions quite a bit. What they <i>don&#x27;t</i> do, because they generally know better, is discuss group-level actions.<p>And that&#x27;s my point.<p>Unless you have an actual example of a discussion of a group entity, such as a government, in any of these fields? Surely personal psychology doesn&#x27;t discuss how a high school clique acts in response to another high school clique?<p>> I guess I concern myself with the the largest of these groups, the human species. While cultures and economic landscapes change, the basic tenants of Praxeology and value-theory do not. Preference and desire is present in all acting humans, and I think these realities can be best used to explain why actions are taken.<p>But this is not real.<p>We have families. We have congregations. We have teams. We have armies. We have governments. We have mafias. We have corporations. We have meetups. We have discussion groups. We have social networks.<p>Pretending that these do not exist is not empiricism. It&#x27;s confirmation bias. It&#x27;s walking along a river and throwing frogs over to the other side because your hypothesis said they wouldn&#x27;t be on this side.<p>> I&#x27;m not claiming individuals don&#x27;t act differently based on their setting and peers, just that these phenomenas can be observed at the individual level in an empirical fashion. If it isn&#x27;t, then your group knowledge is limited.<p>Show me. You&#x27;re claiming to have a lot of empirical evidence. Show me.<p>> That I didn&#x27;t make an incorrect statement?<p>You claimed that I made a false dichotomy when I said you could either evaluate <i>only</i> at the individual level OR have the capacity to talk about group-level effects.<p>To prove that this is a false dichotomy, you have to present a third alternative. That&#x27;s what makes a false dichotomy false. You haven&#x27;t done this.<p>> I would argue that libertarians believe in the antithesis of authoritarianism, and that they have economic and philosophical principles for believing so.<p>So what is it? Is libertarianism about some vague antithesis of authoritarianism, or is libertarianism a framework for analyzing human action? Those aren&#x27;t the same thing.<p>You&#x27;re the one who came in here with guns blazing saying that I didn&#x27;t have a sufficient grasp on libertarian philosophy. Now every time I bring up another dimension of libertarianism, you change what you claim it is. How about starting from some of your axioms and principles and just flat-out explaining it like I&#x27;m five?",1377553871
6280147,comment,6276363,6279915,1,0,lutusp,,,"> According to your example about the night sky, a claim is merely an observation if everyone will make the same claim in response to the same evidence.<p>Not exactly, since that&#x27;s true of established theories also. I would instead say that an observation is something that collects data but doesn&#x27;t try to integrate it into a general pattern or thesis. For example, in England the peppered moth changed colors between 1700 and 1850. Before 1700 it was light-colored, after 1850, it had fully transitioned to a darker color. We now have an observation, a <i>description</i>. No matter how many times the observation is repeated, we will find once again that the moths change color over time, but we still have no explanation.<p>Eventually, because of the theory of evolution by natural selection, the color change was explained as resulting from the moth&#x27;s ability to hide from predators by having the same general color as its surroundings -- and the color of the surroundings had changed as a result of coal-burning. Those moths that happened <i>by chance</i> to have genes for a darker color, were better able to hide from predators. We now have a theory. Our theory can be applied to other neighborhoods, even other species. It&#x27;s not just a specific statement about a particular moth species in a particular place, it&#x27;s a general statement about reality.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution</a><p>> The motives and actions of neither psychiatric pharma, nor society, nor academia even, do not invalidate the possibility that collections of reinforcing ideas and assumptions can explain human thought at some level of neuroscientific abstraction.<p>Yes, but the principle is not the fact. Also, psychology and neuroscience are as different as two fields can possibly be. Psychology studies the mind, which is a philosophical abstraction lacking a physical embodiment. Neuroscience studies the brain and nervous system, which are physical entities amenable to empirical observations, observations on which similarly equipped observers can (must) agree.<p>> For better or worse, Jung, Freud, etc have established such systems which can and have been subject to methodical examination and testing by others. That they have subsequently not held up does not mean that the possibility is invalid.<p>Actually yes, because of the null hypothesis (the precept that an idea without evidence is assumed to be false), it does mean that. An essential property of scientific theories is that they must be empirically falsifiable in practical tests. Some psychological theories cannot be meaningfully tested, which makes them unscientific. Others can be tested, have been tested, and have been falsified, <i>which makes them unscientific</i>.<p>> And yet entrepreneurs expand knowledge with this all the time, as they make predictions about customer behavior, statistically test, refine, extend...<p>Yes, but without a theory that both explains and correctly predicts particular outcomes in advance -- that shows and proves a link between causes and effects -- there is no testable theory and there is no science.<p>> This might not be Los Alamos &quot;science&quot;, but it&#x27;s method is certainly &quot;scientific&quot;.<p>Exercise of a particular scientific method isn&#x27;t by itself enough to call something science. Were this not true, I could hire some scientists to study astrology and thereby make astrology into a science:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/psychology/index.html#The_Architecture_of_Science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/psychology/index.html#The_Architecture_...</a><p>> Should a neuroscientist argue evolutionary anthropology is on shaky ground because we don&#x27;t understand all the details of the underlying neuroscience?<p>In a word, yes, he or she should do just that. If there&#x27;s no structure that connects repeated observations with an empirical, testable theory, it&#x27;s not science.<p>Why do I care? Why should anyone care what psychiatrists and psychologists do? Because they have public clinics and, rather than wait for people to call on them for help, they shout from the rooftops about how sick people are, using as &quot;evidence&quot; the symptoms of diseases they voted into existence. Then they prescribe drugs that have no reliable clinical evidence for effectiveness.

That said, a Spaniard on a thousand pound horse, wrapped in steel, on an open, unobstructed field, against people wearing mostly cloth armor, with stone or copper weapons, was effectively unstoppable. Again that said, many of the non-Spanish troops supporting Pizarro and Co. died.<p>Most of the defeats the Spanish suffered were when some of the more clever Incan generals used the brutal terrain against them: triggering landslides, creating obstructions to disrupt a cavalry charge, etc. While that works in mountain passes, places like Lima (established by Pizarro mid-1500s), were on flat terrain known by the Spanish, so those sorts of tactics did not help during those sieges. The siege of Cuzco (or Cusco, whichever) was in a similar situation to that of Lima.<p>Something that I felt was missing from the Last Days of the Inca was an emphasis on the number of Spaniards, and ignoring the number of shock troops that Pizarro & Co. had recruited by that time. Remember, by the time Manco Inca had decided to &quot;rebel&quot;, the Spaniards had been in Cuzco and some neighboring cities for several years.",1377553712

For example, OSTree explicitly supports extended attributes, so it can support SELinux (and SMACK).  Fedora ships a patched tar but...the tar format is a really serious mess.<p>I would further add though that OSTree does, providing the OS is compatible with it, allow booting a separate &quot;deployment&quot; as a container.  So for example if you have Debian in /ostree/deploy/debian/90cd266 while you&#x27;re booted into /ostree/deploy/fedora/562d0a, you can easily just systemd-nspawn /ostree/deploy/debian/90cd266 and boot the same OS as a container.<p>But the emphasis right now of OSTree is indeed on bare metal deployments, and I&#x27;d like to push hard to integrate with package systems.",1377552603

This seems very porous and weak, but following that logic, I would argue that given evidence that &quot;the brain generates our experience of self by merging information about our body from multiple sources, including the eyes, the skin, the ears, and even ones internal organs&quot; it does not obviously follow that by observing a visualization of your body and heart beat will cause one to experience the phenomena of dissociation with his body. Then it seems that claiming so and contriving repeated samples is scientific.<p>It seems to me, the point you&#x27;re really driving at is that a claim must be couched in some systemic view. It must base itself on a collection of related reinforcing ideas and assumptions (and state as much), and refine or extend that system. These systems abstract irrelevant things. Neuroscientific work is not phrased in string theory. It builds on a system that includes physical assumptions. Should a theoretical physicist argue neuroscience is on shaky ground because we do not understand all the details of the underlying physics? Should a neuroscientist argue evolutionary anthropology is on shaky ground because we don&#x27;t understand all the details of the underlying neuroscience?<p>To your broader point. The motives and actions of neither psychiatric pharma, nor society, nor academia even, do not invalidate the possibility that collections of reinforcing ideas and assumptions can explain human thought at some level of neuroscientific abstraction. For better or worse, Jung, Freud, etc have established such systems which can and have been subject to methodical examination and testing by others. That they have subsequently not held up does not mean that the possibility is invalid.<p>I think also that there&#x27;s a tendency to conflate the physicality (non-qualiality) of phenomena and its ability to be subject to &quot;scientific&quot; methods. And yet entrepreneurs expand knowledge with this all the time, as they make predictions about customer behavior, statistically test, refine, extend... This might not be Los Alamos &quot;science&quot;, but it&#x27;s method is certainly &quot;scientific&quot;.",1377551210

I got a pair of one of those industrial ear protectors, the kind that carpenters or construction workers wear.  Then I use simple in-ear buds and listen to ambient music or jazz.  Anything without vocals.<p>I use this setup pretty much anywhere I am around annoying sounds and it&#x27;s pricelessly quiet.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous noise cancellation BS headphones and none of them can come close.  On airplanes it&#x27;s like entering a warm cocoon of sound that allows me to forget I&#x27;m there.  I can listen to an airplane movie soundtrack at the lowest possible volume and hear nothing else.  The only problem is when the captain pipes up and blasts me away with some stupid announcement.  So I keep my hand near the socket to remove the plug and when I hear the click of the captain&#x27;s mike I immediately unplug.<p>Forget about these overpriced over engineered noise cancellation whatever devices.  My low tech solution is way better for concentration and it costs only around $50-$70.  I&#x27;ve actually had people ask me what kind of noise cancellation headphones I&#x27;m using when wearing my ear-muffs.  I even had a guy in a datacenter ask me if they were USB enabled ;)",1377550838

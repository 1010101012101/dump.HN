Consider this scenario: the virtualization hypervisor is on a reasonably loaded system, and decides to block the virtual machine for every single read.  Since the physical system has several other VMs on it, whenever the VM in question loses its time slice it has to wait a long time to get another one.  Thus, even if the 32K read itself happens quickly, the act of reading alone causes a delay of <i>n</i> milliseconds.  If you increase the read size, your VM still gets scheduled 1000/<i>n</i> times per second, but each time it gets scheduled it reads 5MB instead of 32K.",1313480691

Degrees have been devalued, and are now much easier to get. And ""low skilled"" work no longer means 12 hour days in dangerous environments on starvation wages - a semi-skilled worker in China can make more than a middle-class white-collar worker (though the conditions they work in are not enviable); while hordes of degree-holders compete for a small number of desirable office jobs.<p>But, the attitudes of parents is still: ""If you want to make <i>anything</i> of your life, you <i>must</i> get a degree.

I did well, but I don't feel like I truly understand material until I teach it.<p>That being said, if anybody here has questions on the material, I'd love to help you out in some way. Unfortunately, there is no personal messaging feature on HN, so we might have to resort to emails (or maybe a subreddit?).<p>I realize there is an official class forum, so please tell me if you have any interest in some sort of 3rd party support system :-)",1313478281

Version numbers and release schedules can be separate.  They may be taking a page out of Chrome's playbook but their updates happen much more frequently and I think they push minor revisions in binary form instead of a wholesale update.  All the latest updates to FF have been great and 7 will be really nice if it is as memory efficient as they say but seeing them having an identity crisis after waking up to strong competition doesn't impress.",1313478194

I barely use branches either, and I come from SVN.<p>I use TortoiseSVN, I'm not sure if you do. But when I want to commit in SVN, I bring up the commit tool, select the files I want to commit, write a message in the box, and click commit. But I have to do it all in one go. I can't close the commit window if I forget something, otherwise I have to make sure I copy out the message to paste in again, select all the files.<p>With Git, the staging area is the same as this commit box. It's just a bit more stretched out. Instead of selecting files to commit, and doing it then, you add files to the staging, and commit the staging area. It's a different way of doing it, but I've found it much better for myself. Instead of doing it all in one go, I can add to staging and keep working. Usually I keep open all the files that have changed so I remember which ones to add.<p>Regarding the remote repository, you still can have it remote. Simply instead of ""commit"" being the last action you do to push it to the remote repo, make sure ""git push"" is. I use bitbucket for this, so I know it's ""safe"" in case of computer death or something.<p>I have one more project using SVN and I want to move it to Git, for just me, I don't work in a team or anything like that. I like the staging area, it feels ""lighter"" and that commits are much less drastic, and diffs/logs are MUCH faster since it's all on your computer.

The comments on the second page (which many may have missed) are also somewhat interesting, bringing up previous situations that paint Google's position in a less consistent light.<p>With that all said, I will now draw a different form of analogy, to see whether the same argument dismissal still works: let's say that Google Shopping decided it would no longer sell yamikas, or if Google Maps decided that you couldn't have a sponsored listing for a mosque, or if Google AdWords decided it would not allow advertisements targeted against pending legislation to ban gay marriage rights.<p>In any of these situations, I am fairly certain that we would see tons of upset people claiming the exact same issues: that Google was attempting to use their market position in a politically motivated way, and that they should not be allowed to discriminate. This side would feel that entities with as much centralized power as Google cause an unfair power balance against individuals and minorities.<p>At the same time, we would see people arguing that, while they personally disagree strongly with the actions of Google, they feel that government should not be able to mandate what individual actors do, and that if you want to do any of these things you should go make your own website; some would even say ""this is a perfect opportunity for an alternative Jewish/Islamic/LGBTQ-friendly service provider"".<p>To me, this is a fascinating and complex argument, where neither side is in any way obviously wrong; while at the end of the day we need to make practical decisions in specific circumstances as we all live in the same seemingly-objective reality, we really shouldn't be so quick to dismiss other peoples' positions (and this applies even if the underlying position of one side of an argument seems morally reprehensible to us: it is often the case that the person we are judging feels the same about us).",1341441076

But, unlike most Android phones I have seen, it still provides a fairly elegant and clean user experience that is attractive to the same kind of user that the iPhone is (me, for instance; so far, I buy a new iPhone every time Apple introduces one).<p>Of course, <i>better</i> means different things to different people, but here are some of the things I found to be superior, per my preferences as a user:<p> much bigger screen (I strongly prefer the tradeoff of making it marginally harder to reach the top opposite corner with my thumb in exchange for being able to see more usable information with my eyes) for better book reading and web browsing<p> typing feels better and is more accurate (due to larger size & haptic feedback I think)<p> incomparably better maps navigation; even when I already have my iPhone 4S <i>in my hand</i> I get the Galaxy Nexus out of the backpack if I need directions<p> no worrying that Apple will rip me off retroactively, by disabling an app I bought from them (the Airfoil Speakers debacle) to protect some fucked licensing arrangement to make my phone work only with expensive proprietary hardware and not with standard commodity hardware<p> can load any software I want, not just from the maker's app store, without requiring me to exploit a bug in the OS to jailbreak<p> integrates with Google Voice<p>It does have deficiencies, too; it crashes much more than my iPhone, the OS lacks the level of polish in a lot of ways, camera isn't as good, etc. Which is better depends on the user, and still would probably be the iPhone for most.<p>My point is just that the $349 unlocked Galaxy Nexus has some aspects which could be considered advantages over the iPhone, but it is still appealing to exactly the kind of user that the iPhone appeals to. Somebody who wants a smooth, uncluttered, pretty pocket computer that ""just works"" with minimal hassle. Google removes the crapware, gets rid of the funk-ass nonstandard UI skins, provides all the system updates, automatically links up with whatever services in their ecosystem you use... so with this phone they've done the best job of creating that type of product.<p>Therefore, to the iPhone, I think the Galaxy Nexus is the most directly threatening Android phone yet produced.<p>So, supposing you were an asshole with some bogus patents to go trolling with, that's probably where you'd want to start.",1341439745

In other words, he's saying that when you say ""You change the chemical composition of the body in X way, and this causes feelings,"" everything after 'way' is redundant.",1229694893

If your overpaid programmers are writing O(n^2) algorithms then that cheap hardware is going to get expensive real quick. Even if hardware was <i>free</i> you still need to put it somewhere, power it, cool it and so on. There's no excuse for sloppy coding.",1229694706

Why does it have to be an either/or thing?<p>If you're passionate about something, chances are you'll spot opportunities to do it. ""Follow your opportunities"" is good advice, but this article fails to realise that some (most?) of us won't feel that we've fulfilled our purpose in life (irrespective of religious considerations - I'm talking about that sense of self-fulfillment you get when you're doing something you think is worthwhile) if we spend it castrating lamb with our teeth.<p>So follow your passion AND your opportunities.

Coincidentally, 4/5 of those banks either don't exist or don't do i-banking.<p>But quants <i>along</i> with other strats (macro, long/short, etc) all had bad risk management models. You can't blame only program trading when there was so much human error.<p>Also: quants (meaning algorithmic trading) did not show how MBS were good.

I posted this comment on techcrunch a few hours ago, and now I recheck the search results, all 600+ ebooks seem to have disappeared.<p>No matter, just search for something else.

It was always cheaper to optimise the code than it was to invest in new hardware. I must admit that it is hard to shrug off the frugal approach to the hardware that I adopted at the start of my developer career - I think it still pays off to err on the side of low hardware overhead whenever the option arises.",1229692945

Monitor real-estate is important since you don't have to use time and effort to shuffle all the windows you want to use. But what about the rest of the systems, two laptops and three servers?<p>I've read Stefan Didak's home office description as well, and he says that having a massive amount of storage and cycles can help you if you're doing complicated work. Does someone have an example of jobs that become easier with 4 terabytes of local storage and thirty CPU cores? It seems to me the overhead of administrating these kinds of system would dwarf any benefit.<p>Obviously I am wrong, but how? This stuff looks fun, and it definitely sounds fun to be more effective than your peers by making ""unacceptable"" choices regarding the tools you use.<p>[Edit: If you have the same questions, have a look at <a href=""http://www.stefandidak.com/ramble/2007/04/03/home-office-usage-scenarios-1-and-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stefandidak.com/ramble/2007/04/03/home-office-usa...</a>.

Also, any particular product of consciousness is easily produced without it.

Of course, you can use printf and output variable values all you want, but that won't get you far and you'll still be a blind-foldedly

I have tripled my RescueTime (YC W07) productivity score in a matter of days, here's how I did it:<p>* LeechBlock for Firefox.  There's always ways ""around"" these blocks, but it's more of a matter of disincentivizing the bad behavior, not disabling it.<p>* Use a feed reeder, <i>keep it off</i>.<p>* Working in an office.  I've been telecommute contractor for 6 months now.  I recently started working onsite for a company, and it's done wonders.<p>* Watching the ""Productivity for Programmers"" screencast at PeepCode.  I am very anti-self-help, but this screencast has a lot of very helpful, practical advice rooted in common sense and backed by science.<p>Most of the advice my wife had been trying to tell me for months, but it took Lars Pind's explanation to really crack through my thick skull.  It's not even about going through ""the motions"" of setting goals and all that.  It's more about being able to ask your self - ""what am I doing? Is this really productive?"" - and being able to know when you're being genuine and when your brain is lying to yourself.",1229691965

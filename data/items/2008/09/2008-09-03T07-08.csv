If they start pushing it (really pushing it - marketing lies and all) on the famously minimalist Google home page they have a real chance of penetrating the IE home market.<p>Of course, in the enterprise people often are not given the chance to instal their browser of choice, and IE will retain a good chunk of the market through this alone, which is the overriding reason that I have for voting for FF to lose market share over IE.",1220428152

Other than that he was the technical lead for Java's HotSpot VM.<p>It's a very interesting approach they have taken, especially with class transitions and compilation. I hope Python / Ruby / Perl and other languages can learn and optimize with these ideas and code base.<p>Btw. Java was interpreted at first, JIT was first added with HotSpot and the speed improvement was around 20x.",1220428051

<a href=""http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html#4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html#4</a><p><i>The effort by the Princeton student, John Phillips, was much more widely publicized. He made extravagant claims that his bomb would explode with a force of more than 10,000 tons of TNT. He took on a publicity agent, wrote a book, appeared on many TV and radio shows, received very wide newspaper coverage, and even ran for Congress.<p>What he claimed to have produced was a design for a bomb in a term paper prepared for a physics course. I spoke to his professor in that course, who said that there was nothing in his paper that would ordinarily be called a design. There were only crude sketches without dimensions. There were no calculations to support his claim that his bomb would work. He had collected a lot of information that would be useful in designing a bomb, for which the professor gave him an A grade.<p>Phillips was being called by media people so frequently that he had to have a separate telephone installed in his dormitory for that purpose. His professor told me that he himself had been contacted by many newsmen, but they never printed what he told them — they only trumpeted that Phillips had designed a workable bomb.<p>Several people have told me that professional government bomb designers have said that a design for a bomb by some student would work. I know that this could not be true because it would be a very serious breach of security regulations for a person who was ever involved with the government program to comment on a design that is available to the public. Note that the MIT student's design was judged by a ""Swedish expert."" With regard to such claims about Phillips' design, no professional could possibly consider a sketch without dimensions to be a design capable of being evaluated for performance. Science and technology are highly quantitative disciplines, but apparently Phillips does not understand that fact.<p>There have been numerous statements in newspapers, including our university paper, that any college student could design a nuclear bomb. In reply, I published an offer in our university paper of an unqualified A grade in both of the two courses on nuclear energy that I was teaching for any student who can show me a sketch of a workable plutonium bomb together with a quantitative calculation showing that it would work. My offer has been repeated about 10 times over the last 15 years. Three students turned in papers, but none of them had as much as 5% of what could be called a design.<p>All of this discussion has been about designs on paper, but as is clear from the above quoted statements by experts, that is only a small part of the task faced by terrorists. The fabrication requires a wide degree of expertise and experience in technical areas. It requires people capable of carrying out complex physics and engineering computations, handling hazardous materials, arranging electronically for a hundred or so triggers to fire simultaneously within much less than a millionth of a second, accurately shaping explosive charges, attaching them precisely and connecting the triggers to them, and so on. Where would terrorists find this expertise?</i>",1220427990

Flash uses it's own VM, Tamarin, so it's not dependent on the browser. Browser, of course, does play a role in performance of plugins (rate of input etc) but not much. Testing Flash games to see how fast browser and it's JS is a pointless waste of time.",1220427621

Even in the 60's there was enough publicly available information that anyone with an advanced knowledge of Physics could do it. Imagine how much easier it must be now.<p>On the other hand, we should be worried that someone will kidnap some Plutonium. That it is difficult to get is the only thing saving us.

293617,comment,293442,293464,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Ah, ok, fixing the <? was pretty easy, then.  Thanks for the fast response.<p>My complaints about the markup:<p>1. img tags without alt, which is invalid HTML, and an accessibility problem.  Further, some of these are ""fake"" links, in that they have inline styles to make them appear like links, and inline onclick actions, but are not wrapped in anchors, or given tabindex=0 to make them focusable.  You actually can't activate them without using a mouse.<p>2. css included in the <body>, which causes an unsightly reflow, and is not valid html or xhtml.  Wordpress provides an event that triggers at the closing </head> tag, I believe.<p>3. despite the included css, and an id on almost everything, several elements have inline style attributes.  Why is this necessary?<p>4. An empty inline script tag? What's that all about?<p>Is it really necessary to <i>require</i> javascript to even view comments properly?  It seems like there's a lot of anchors with href=""#"" that could have reasonable fallback URLs given the data in $dsq_response.  Heck, even the form could post to a disqus.com url, so you could comment without JS.<p>Also, like I said, I do really like where you guys are coming from.  Seems like you've got the right idea.",1220426035

They have their own system which I could talk about rather at length if anyone wanted, but in short is really not very good (but is probably passable).  They split the frame into 16 rectangular slices and encode them in separate streams, each of which runs at a constant bitrate.  Updates to each block are staggered 1ms apart, for a total frame latency of about 16ms.<p>More problematic is their awful business model, which, given that it's thought up by the guy behind WebTV, is probably not very surprising.",1263455883

Granted there are some barriers there, but it's fundamentally more efficient than any other broadcast method.  It just hasn't been worth it yet because for those few events we've already had long-existing broadcast TV networks.<p>Hell, you could even do it purely at the application level with BitTorrent.<p>Cable is cheaper now because of sunk costs, but cable companies are much too fat to innovate at this point.  They will do whatever they can to keep prices high and cling to their cash cow, while Internet bandwidth inevitably becomes cheaper fueled by thousands of disparate interests.

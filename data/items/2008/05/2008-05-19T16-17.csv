194193,comment,194070,194070,0,0,etal,,,"Consider the following analogy:<p><pre><code>  psychology researchers : gender differences :: moths : flame
</code></pre>
Rosalind Chait Barnett at the bottom of the article has it right. Investigating gender differences is the first quest every psych grad student embarks on, and 19 times out of 20, they're disappointed to find nothing significant. (The other 1/20 is the false positive that comes with 95% confidence testing.) It bothers me that this article pursues so many hypotheses at once -- planning for career flexibility; language aptitude; discrimination; women fulfilled through biology, men through machines. None of them is a satisfactory answer because in a properly controlled gender-differences experiment, having filtered out the noise, there's no signal left.<p>On the surface, the differences are there, but it's not due to anything innate. The East-versus-West comparison in the article should make that obvious. (The article claims it's because we're more ""free"".) It's cultural. Duh. I don't see anything wrong with that, either; it doesn't mean there should be a 50:50 gender split in every field. But looking for the explanation in biology is a dead end that enough researchers have run into already.",1211215356

There are a couple of hundred 3G nokia handsets though. In the UK the combination of no 3G and limited carrier/plan selection seems to have killed the iPhone off pretty well.<p>I suspect the same is true of most other non-US countries where the carriers are much less dominant and good handsets, network portability and competitive pay as you use deals are well entrenched.<p>On the other hand the number of Linux based devices is truly staggering. I can't find the reference at the moment but I believe that something like 300m embedded units were shipping a year. A million plus Eee 700 series devices alone were distributed. 10-15 million phones running Linux were shipped just in Asia(1) which should put iPhone sales of 2-3m in perspective.<p>(1) <a href=""http://linux.sys-con.com/read/182937.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux.sys-con.com/read/182937.htm</a>",1211214643

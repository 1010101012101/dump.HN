The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.<p>Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.<p>FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.<p>SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.<p>We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn’t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.<p>When considering you as a candidate, we won’t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that you’re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that you’re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. You’re the engineer that other engineers can count on—you’re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the team’s passionate dedication to the mission.<p>At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and “launching” the product will be like no other product launch you’ve ever experienced!\nNote for new or recent graduates: If you’re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.<p>You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com. Thanks!",1385931291

6829266,comment,6828721,6828985,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Road tolls are quite undesirable. Tolls require some toll collecting apparatus which wastes that portion of the collected funds and may have negative externalities (e.g. increased surveillance, increased air pollution or reduced road capacity due to slowing for toll booths). Moreover, it discourages productive use of the road. If a toll discourages use of a road at any point in time when the road is being used at less than its full capacity then you&#x27;re &quot;wasting&quot; the road and creating secondary inefficiencies, e.g. fewer people in the office park on one side of the toll road will travel the road to visit a coffee house on the other side which causes the coffee house to lose business, and allows a different coffee house that happens to be in the opposite direction from the office park to raise prices and gouge the workers in the office park.<p>You can see the obvious analogies with patents on publicly funded research.<p>This is to be distinguished from congestion pricing which has nothing to do with paying for the road and should only apply at the times when the road would otherwise have insufficient capacity for the traffic volume, with the explicit intent of reducing usage. Note however that congestion pricing can be inefficient for many of the same reasons and is also undesirable unless the alternatives of expanding road capacity or improving mass transit to reduce traffic volume are both impractical.",1385931202

Patents claim to benefit the public by providing incentive to (a) invest in research that may be easily &quot;scooped&quot; by competitors and (b) disseminate information about inventions so that others can benefit.  I do not find either compelling in the case of universities.  The vast majority of research at universities occurs regardless of possible royalties because it is externally-funded and researchers compete for grant funding and prestige.  Publishing a significant result first garners citations and prestige (and likely helps fund future proposals), directly benefitting both the researcher and their institution.

So far BitCoin meets that criteria and so it is not &#x27;fools gold.&#x27;<p>He also missed the part where someone cracks your 256 bit key to your wallet and steals all your BitCoin. There is an interesting cryptography problem/question which looks at the cost of mining new BitCoins in comparison to the cost of attempting to guess BitCoin wallet keys.",1385930502

The revolutionary thing about Bitcoin is that it is a (nearly) zero trust method of transacting. The value is in the fact that there is no central bank to be afraid of. Most of the wealth my parents have lost in their savings was due to inflation and debt backed asset bubbles. Both of which are symptoms of a debt-prone central banking system. There might be arguments that these central banks stabilize the economy for the betterment of everyone, but that is irrelevant when it comes time to choose a currency. Do you want inflation, meddling, and regulation? Serious question. The uninformed should say &quot;yes&quot; and the informed might want to say &quot;no&quot;.<p>As for whether or not people are right about Bitcoin being a bubble, I think that bitcoin has a highger likelihood of 20 year success than Twitter and a lower market capitalization.

That takes time, up to several days if you don&#x27;t have a favorable launch window from your launch pad.<p>Next you need a pre-text. I&#x27;m going to assert that it is a reasonable assumption that the Moon base is presenting as either entirely docile (scientific research etc) or entirely hostile (sending rocks at the planet). If its the latter taking out the handful of launch facilities is pretty straight forward which prevents any future attack from that vector. If its the former, well your attacking country needs to come up with a reason why they are flying what is no doubt a nuclear warhead, in the guise of a satellite toward the Moon.<p>Then there is terminal control (targeting at the site). So you may know in general what facilities are on the Moon from an initial landing point, but if the base has existed there for any length of time all bets are off. Also making the initial establishment on the dark side would force an adversary to first orbit the moon trying to identify your base, and then de-orbit into an attack orbit.<p>During its orbit your attack device will be vulnerable to orbiting defensive satellites which probably also play the role of communications relay which justifies them in lunar orbit in the first place.<p>My point is that mounting an attack on the Moon from the Earth is much more difficult and expensive than mounting an attack on the Earth from the Moon. Because the moon has a much shallower gravity well and the Earth has a much wider variety of targets which are more easily threatened.<p>The US and Soviets understood this although the technology to implement it was so expensive neither could afford to carry through. The cost of the technology has come way way down and once again there is another country putting its hat in the ring as &#x27;superpower.&#x27; In a weird way, that means someone is going to the Moon, to create a permanent installation. My thought is that the US is like the hare in the story of the tortoise an the hare, confident in its ability to make that happen if it becomes necessary.",1385929725

A monoid is composed of three things: a type, a combiner, and a null value.<p><pre><code>    Monoid = (T, <>, e)\n</code></pre>\nAnd it must follow the laws that the null value (`e`) is the zero of the combiner (`<>`) on both sides and that the combiner is associative.<p><pre><code>    e <> x == x\n    x <> e == x\n    x <> y <> z == x <> (y <> z) == (x <> y) <> z\n</code></pre>\nExamples include (Integer, +, 0) or (Integer, *, 1) or (List, append, []).<p>The trick is that if you are trying to fold up a law-abiding Monoid of any kind then you know two things (a) you have a default value which you can insert wherever you like to no effect and (b) you can reassociate your expression (rotate your evaluation tree) to be any shape you like at all.<p><pre><code>    ((((1 + 1) + 1) + 1 ) + 1)     -- left\n    ==\n    (1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + 1))))      -- right\n    ==\n    ((1 + 1) + (1 + 1) + (1 + 0))  -- parallel\n</code></pre>\nBy encoding these laws into the type system, you provide information to the compiler which it could theoretically use to rearrange and optimize your computations on the fly. To my knowledge, this isn&#x27;t done anywhere yet, but knowledge of those laws does allow you to confidently build efficient parallel algorithms. For instance, we know that a dictionary full of monoidal values is itself a monoid.<p><pre><code>    instance Monoid v => Monoid (Map k v)\n</code></pre>\nWe take the empty dictionary as `e` and let our combiner be the union on keys where values are combined using their own monoidal combiner. This forms a really nice basis for a large class of map-reduce algorithms where the mapping step results in some kind of dictionary-like summarization of values.",1385929500

6829095,comment,6826073,6826654,1,0,kyzyl,,,"There are some practical limits to voltage conversion if you want to keep that high efficiency. Probably most important is that your switching frequency shouldn&#x27;t be as high as it is in most small devices (because high freq. allows you to use smaller components).<p>In any case, as dfox mentions, most internal voltage level conversions won&#x27;t be switched, because it adds complexity. They will be some form of linear regulation s.t. they can move between logic levels. That&#x27;s different than moving from  whatever high voltage is on your 150W USB line into a level that won&#x27;t fry CMOS circuitry. There&#x27;s a reason that the wall-->DC plug conversion usually happens in a brick on your power cable. Switched mode will be used as sparingly as possible, such as when you also need AC signals rectified, if you need both buck and boost depending on a battery or something, or if you need to be able to modify the control loop dynamically.<p>> those microwaves and kettles are getting up to 15A @ 120VRMS continuously, which works out to 1800W<p>Well that&#x27;s kind of my point. Even at 1.8kW those devices don&#x27;t need to draw 20A continuous (or even pulsed, because of the fuse). Basically no matter what you&#x27;re doing, the copper losses are roughly fixed by the hardware. What you can control are heat dissipation and current levels, and it&#x27;s a lot more fun to play with Ohm&#x27;s law than try to fight against thermodynamics.",1385929212

Those products have real tangible value. Very few people are interested in buying bitcoin just to use the bitcoin address as artwork, for example. Tulip bulbs had more actual value. At its peak, one tulip bulb cost around €25,000 and WAS being used for legitimate purchases: milk, cheese, cows, wine, etc. Even after the price of tulip bulbs crashed, you could still at least plant them and grow flowers.

If it doesn&#x27;t pass through a C compiler, it&#x27;s not C or &quot;C/anything&quot;.<p>Now it is quite possible to use the subsets of C and C++ to write code that conforms to both language specifications and compiles with a compiler for either language.  If some project deliberately does this, I don&#x27;t have an issue with calling it C/C++ to hilight the fact.  This however really is quite rare from what I&#x27;ve seen, even if I can name some projects that do make such code (the Opus audio codec is one example).<p>C/C++ still isn&#x27;t a language though, so I would very much <i>prefer</i> to call it C in a case like this.<p>A different scenario entirely would be a project with parts clearly written in two (or more) different languages, which could happen to be C and C++...",1385928219

Other than a small bump in the 1970s, we&#x27;ve more or less been operating on Keynesian economic policy since FDR.<p>Inflation and deflation only really impact you when a) your wages get out of sync with cost-of-living prices, or b) you are borrowing or lending money (or just have cash sitting around that isn&#x27;t being utilized in any fashion). If your wages <i>and</i> prices all fell to 1/10000th of what  they are today, your purchasing power (in terms of hours worked per loaf of bread gained) would remain the same.<p>Deflation would harm your ability to (responsibly) take on debt. But, it&#x27;s arguable that our current economies are so heavily debt-fueled because of our inflationary policies, as well, so it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind as a variable when processing the concept that deflation = less borrowing. Deflation is scary to Keynesian economists because the Keynesian model only works when people aren&#x27;t significantly saving anything beyond what they invest - that is, their money is all either spent on goods, or is loaned to other people. Holding money in an inflating economy is irrational since it is constantly losing purchasing power; thus, since it is in your best interest to spend your money as soon as you make it (either on goods and services, or by investing it somewhere that will offer a return greater than the rate of inflation), money keeps on rolling around in the economy.<p>The theory is that once people start socking away money in their mattresses, you get recession or depression. Deflation would encourage lending (either directly or through investment), but since it discourages borrowing, people may end up unable to find people to accept their money, and the economy grinds to a halt.",1385928074

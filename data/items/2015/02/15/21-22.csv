The author is simply suggesting, albeit not as clearly as he could have, that we have focused in isolation on only a subset of the nutrients we actually need. Obviously, the responsible &quot;next step&quot; to that sort of argument would be to form hypotheses and undertake further study. But that&#x27;s not really the function of the article, as far as I&#x27;m aware.<p>Consider the broccoli example mentioned in the article:<p><i>&quot;A 2011 study on broccoli, for example, found that giving subjects fresh broccoli florets led them to absorb and metabolize seven times more of the anticancer compounds known as glucosinolates, present in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, than when glucosinolates were given in straight capsule form. The researchers hypothesized that this might be because the whole broccoli contained other compounds that helped people’s bodies put the anticancer chemicals to use.&quot;</i><p>Now, the &quot;appeal to nature&quot; argument here would be that there is something fundamentally irreducible or non-replicable in broccoli that we just can&#x27;t reproduce in a lab, because nature. That&#x27;s not what the article says. Instead, it says that researchers hypothesized that there may be more components to broccoli than we&#x27;ve yet figured out. That&#x27;s science. Science is always probing at the edges of what we haven&#x27;t yet figured out, or revising what we think we <i>have</i> figured out.<p>The author does his point no favors by harping about synthetic vitamins. I&#x27;ll grant you that. But he&#x27;s not advancing any magical thinking.",1424037584

I suppose he could genuinely believe that more state intervention in our digital lives is ultimately the right call for our security, but I feel like the president would be informed enough to know better. But perhaps he is just in a bubble that makes it hard to see how harmful their security measures are.<p>Either way I agree that the issue is a citizen&#x27;s issue and not a liberal or conservative one. Both parties have been failing to look our for their constituents and I feel like a true people&#x27;s progressive party would be an important force to disrupt that pattern.<p>I guess I should be careful about accusing people of lying however, as it could derail my message when the specifics of lie vs bad idea are really not at issue.

You can have as many binding transactions per second as you want off the chain.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to engage in transactions off-chain then you might as well use PayPal or other fiat. The blockchain and the protocol surrounding its maintenance is central to Bitcoin and its philosophy, it&#x27;s not merely some &#x27;nice-to-have&#x27; feature that should be jettisoned as soon as it becomes inconvenient.<p>After all, the blockchain is the one and only authoritative Bitcoin ledger, everything else in Bitcoin is an IOU, no matter how sensible it might seem, which is why Bitcoin itself will reject a transaction if it&#x27;s not included into a mined block in time.<p>And either way, way to ignore the in-practice 2-3 transaction per second limit.",1424037527

And it&#x27;s mystifying that some critics of the self-esteem movement (such as the author of this article) are as strident in their criticism as they are.<p>The behavior that bullies exhibit isn&#x27;t caused by high self-esteem, but by their need to overcompensate for low self-esteem through anti-social actions.  They see themselves as inadequate, and they see others as threats.  When people have this self-concept, their fight-or-flight response kicks in.  Bullies gravitate toward their &quot;fight&quot; instinct, and social recluses toward their &quot;flight&quot; instinct.  People with truly high self-esteem don&#x27;t see others as threats, so they feel no need to treat them as anything other than equals.<p>Bill Gates and Warren Buffett don&#x27;t feel the need to talk about how rich they are, or put down people with less money.

9054210,comment,9053286,9053286,0,0,RussianCow,,,"> ...the speed of Python is not nearly as fast as your database, when dealing in terms of standard CRUD-style applications...<p>The blanket assumptions that most developers are building &quot;standard CRUD-style applications&quot; and that the database is never a bottleneck make it difficult for me to take this post seriously. Sure, if you&#x27;re running a simple to-do list app, you probably won&#x27;t need asynchronous I/O, but in my experience, real-world business apps actually tend to use fairly complex database logic. And sure, there are ways of speeding up your app that don&#x27;t involve touching the Python side (caching using Redis, denormalizing, etc), but they are a lot harder to implement than asynchronous I/O. Why give up on some free performance for many types of applications?<p>Also, the author mentions and then completely dismisses PyPy. Why? I&#x27;ve used PyPy on a production web app, and I can say for certain that from that point, the Python code completely ceased being the bottleneck at any point--the majority of the time spent was in the database. Again, I could have implemented better caching and restructured my schema, but at that point, dropping in asyncio would have been way easier and allowed the app to scale with much less effort.<p>There is definitely some validity to the post, but the author makes blanket assumptions that drastically weaken his argument.",1424035868

Go is a wonderful tool to get things done with. I recently rewrote a cross platform `enterprise` app from java (25k LOC) to go (8k LOC) and saw improvements in readability, memory footprint, and overall quality. Some notes on my experiences so far:<p>Go binary size is a non-issue for most software. The java-rewrite I mentioned above went from a 80MB or so binary, to a 8MB executable. That said, there&#x27;s been a few occasions when I&#x27;ve really wanted to use go for an embedded project, but couldn&#x27;t due to it&#x27;s size.<p>I read somewhere, someone said of go, &quot;you&#x27;ll come for the concurrency, but you&#x27;ll stay for the interfaces. This is very true for me.<p>Generics. Go&#x27;s red herring. Sure, there&#x27;s been a handful of occasions where generics would have saved me some boiler-plate, but it&#x27;s not been a pain point for me.<p>Tooling, from fmt, vet, to unit testing are all first rate. However, I wish there was a better debugger option for go. I know that gdb works with go (and with a great deal of difficulty if you develop with OSX) but I&#x27;m probably not alone when I say I really dislike GDB.<p>Overall, I&#x27;ve found the community to be friendly both online and in person.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;ve noticed much of the recent vitriol towards Go seems to come from the Rust crowd which I think is too bad. I enjoy both. Languages are not a zero-sum game. Who knows, the hate means Go has finally arrived.",1424034622

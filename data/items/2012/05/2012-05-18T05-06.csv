I am just making the point that ""libertarian"" is a too generic term to put everything and everyone in a single bag. There are anarcho-libertarians, libertarians who support the idea of a balance between government and private investment, and many other variations.<p>I think the only generic you can say about libertarians is that : they care about freedom of property and consider government intervention in private affairs with criticism. Beyond this point, the commonalities disappear, and there is a wider range of opinions among libertarians than in any other political group out there. There is no real ""dogma"", while Von Mises and Hayek are more or less recognized as Thought leaders for some of them.<p>I did not claim, by the way, that Hayek was ""right"" about anything, I just wanted to show one of the figureheads of some parts of the movement. Getting a Nobel Prize does not mean anything to me, and I personally feel very strongly that the recent Economy Nobel Prize Jo Stiglitz does not know what he is talking about (he's just an old school Keynesian, and even Keynes himsel admitted in being wrong later in his life).

However, this was just dropped on me without any request or action on my part. It was a preemptive ""oh God please stay at least until date X"", but I didn't have anything to do with causing it directly. It was just smart/panicked managers buying insurance. And it worked.

First, <i>they don't pay top salaries</i>.  If a bidding war erupts for a particular candidate it is highly unlikely that a VC startup wins.  It will be won by everyone's favorite multinational advertising company which will <i>this quarter</i> hire enough engineers to staff approximately 1023signals worth of product dev companies, or their close bretheren AppAmaFaceSoft, which together could a) fill the SuperDome with engineers making more than $120k apiece (and substantially more these days) and b) which cannot reasonably be said to be paying engineers with money they swindled out of gullible investors.  No, they pay the money with the <i>hundreds of billions of dollars of sales</i> they make directly attributable to software.<p>The price of butter is the price of butter.  If one hypothetically thinks butter is too expensive, sell butter, don't buy butter.  (i.e. offer your services as an engineer rather than trying to hire engineers.)  It think it is highly unlikely that anything happening in the capital markets, positive or negative, will make cause engineering (and related trades) to re-transition to the days where you could e.g. find perfectly adequate programmers for $40k.  (P.S. Not to slight anybody making that, as I was at $30k like two years ago.  Get a wee bit more sophisticated about who you work for and what you work on.  You'll do better monetarily and quite possibly have more fun.)<p>There exist repeatable ways to scalably build product businesses with millions of dollars of actual revenue out of a few man months of work.

I would normally think the sum total of all development (I'm lumping things like specs, coding, documenting, and testing all together) to be at the very least close to 50% of a startup's value, so if there is only one developer, he or she would seem to be worth about half the company.

What Facebook offers today for 99% of its users is about the same as it was 4 years ago. And they just give it away to those 99% for free. IIRC advertising and Zynga (another company, not them really) is where Facebook makes most of their money, and there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that Facebook ads don't work and don't get people to buy things. In contrast, Amazon monetizes almost every thing they've developed and invested in, people are throwing money at them, and they're more innovative. And Jeff Bezos is still alive and in charge, whereas Steve Jobs is dead. So yes, I'd expect a much better, more ""expectations of future awesomeness"" kind of P/E from Amazon than Facebook.<p>And it's much easier to start from scratch and build a functional replacement for Facebook (see Instragram, etc.) than it would be to replace Amazon's offerings.

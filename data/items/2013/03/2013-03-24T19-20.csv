It's possible to achieve, but even most advanced meditators aren't spending long stretches of time thought-free. Wrestling with your concentration and being aware of what you're experiencing is meditation.<p>It's pernicious because it leads people to believe that they're not any good at meditating, since they look at their mind and are aghast at how cluttered and chaotic it is. The fact that you now start to see it, <i>IS</i> meditation.<p>You were doing just fine.",1364155194

Before, no electronics of any kind. Now, reading devices. This is strictly progress[1], and we should be happy for all the progress we get. If Marco (or more plausibly, apple) was to start lobbying in a year or so to permit tablets, then being able to point to a year of kindle safe flying would be a good thing. It seems unlikely that amazon (who are in the tablet business as well) choose to somehow limit the change to only reading devices.<p>[1] Lets ignore the risk to flight safety caused by letting passengers use electronics.

Google's a case of a decent company (for its size) with some terrible managers, though. I don't mean to cast aspersion on the whole thing. If you get a good manager, I'd still recommend it. There's some really cool stuff happening at Google and if you can get good projects, even now it's a great place to work.<p>Two of the companies included are defunct.

However, any individual who wants to ask me if an NYC education startup is That One can email me and I'll confirm or deny.

Of course children of successful educated parents would be better off that children growing in broken up family with absentee parents and zero attention to their education. The only way it could be otherwise is to drag everybody down to the lowest possible level. The whole talk about ""unfair advantage"" sounds insane to me - why not then beautiful people or smart people have ""unfair advantage""? Let's do it like in the Vonnegut's <i>Sirens on Titan</i> (or <i>Harrison Bergeron</i>) - let everybody be dragged down to the lowest level, let everybody has poorest education that we can provide to everybody, let everybody be as ugly as the ugliest person alive, as weak as weakest person alive, as dumb as dumbest person alive, as miserable and sick as the most miserable and sick person alive. This is only way it can be ""fair"". And people seriously think this approach is not only sane, but the ONLY sane one? Just boggles the mind.<p>The problem is that redistribution does not solve the problem. Moreover, by becoming obsessed with redistribution solving the real problems only becomes harder. We are way beyond the stage where the money were the actual issue, all bake sales aside. The problem is much harder and has to do with the community, the general environment, the history, the social engineering failures, there's a huge mess there, but it there not because of the lack of government involvement. If anything, partially it's there exactly because of this involvement, which failed to predict the consequences.<p>>>>> That's probably why if you want to live out the American dream Denmark is a better place than the US to do it<p>Highly doubt it. Somehow where I live there's Google, Facebook, and hundreds others already done, and thousands others in the making, and in Denmark you have.... well, I couldn't name one, to be frank. Maybe there are some, but not many heard of them. Somehow Stroustrup is in Texas and DHH is in Chicago, and we don't have a huge wave of US citizens moving to Denmark to pursue their dreams.<p>Maybe if you move there, you have higher chance of secure mediocre living, but it's not exactly what people call ""American dream"".",1364154918

Currently it's difficult to decide when to spawn new VMs, because it takes time to spawn a new one (and billing is computed hourly, but that's another issue), so it complicated to decide whether to pump up the steam or wait a little bit more.

5433286,comment,5432713,5432713,10,0,notJim,,,"I try to meditate about twice a week, but I haven't been keeping it up lately, so I put once a month. I started because there was a thread here where people described the benefits. I was (and still am) very skeptical of the self-reported effects, since there's a strong possibility of placebo, but at the same time, I figured if all these people like it, it's worth a try. Maybe it's just a placebo, but it sounds like a pleasant one, and the downside is essentially non-existent.<p>To get started, I read Mindfullness in Plain English [1], which is a pretty practical, no-nonsense guide with minimal New Age woo. It addresses a lot of the problems and questions a beginner will have getting started.<p>I can't really claim any long-lived effects or benefits of it. As I said, I'm very skeptical by nature, so I tend to be wary of attributing anything to it. One thing that's very clear and noticeable though is that I feel very mentally different during and afterward. My mind is quiet in a way that it otherwise never is, and I feel like I perceive the world differently somehow (maybe more clearly or more at face value.) It reminds a lot of a hyper-focused flow state, except it's non-directional. It's like I'm focused on everything and nothing all at once.<p>After I started, I did some reading on wikipedia and found that meditation has been found in scientific studies to have certain benefits and neurological effects. It's apparently even a treatment doctors recommend for handling stress and anxiety. That has helped me stick with it, because the meditation community is full of New Age bullshit.

It's nothing personal, you might be a great, smart person. But it's a matter of the odds; your past makes you a risk that's not worth taking unless I know you well enough to be certain that you would never do anything like that again, and there's just no way you're going to convince me of that through an interview process.<p>The last one is the real sticking point, because I know what it's like to be a young kid on BBSes and the internet and wanting to try to break things, etc. But even with that understanding, I still wouldn't trust you unless I knew you really well.<p>And that's why I'd recommend pursuing another career.

5433277,comment,5432713,5433032,1,0,xk_id,,,"Well I think meditation is sort of like a minimalistic tool for training yourself. So I reckon it's part of the point to figure out how to get yourself ""into a habit"", etc.<p>Anyway, I don't think anything <i>substantial</i> can come out of meditation alone. If you use meditation as a ""training ground"" for learning discipline, etc. then you may argue those understandings are later useful in practical matters. But then, again, why not train yourself while at those practical matters? Granted, the simplicity of the meditative practice might make it easier to deal with things like what somebody else in this thread calls ""negative thought patterns"", etc. But I think the whole practice of meditation emerged from an interest of making the ""world"" to gradually ""disappear"". Somebody in this thread speaks of the ""<i>dissolution</i> of the ego"", fasting, etc. Meditative practice appears to have been birthed out of a yearning for...... destruction of details, diversity and complexity. But until when? That doesn't sound right to me. On the other hand, some other people equate meditation with going to a park, or riding the bicycle. That's disconnecting from one ""world"" and connecting to another; I can see the point of that, it's refreshing, relaxing. And I think it's better, because at least it performs a replacement with something mildly interesting and <i>engaging</i>, rather than... an empty wall (?!). Sitting in front of an empty wall just seems morbid to me.<p>As for the ""feel good"" factor, when you're meditating (in front of a wall) you are not contributing much to anything, so it sounds like meditation is a surrogate for ""getting high""; or at least some form of really cheap entertainment. Surely there are preferable alternatives  like listening to good music, or reading a good book.",1364154460

The whole point to git for KDE is that that ""distributed"" part of the VCS would help handle backups.

Although they wouldn't have found anything, I think something bad in my past I'm long removed from wouldn't have been a barrier.  Most small company and startup jobs are founded on relationships rather than forms and policies, which is the way it should be.<p>If your personality, character, ambition, shared vision, portfolio or code samples, work history, or profile in the developer / startup community is well-known, I think your conviction not only wouldn't be insurmountable, I don't even think it would be a blip on the radar.  If it ever was, it might even make you cool with the right founders/team.<p>That said, when the company you're working for gets big, you will have already likely signed something giving them blanket permission to look into you, and during an investor or acquirer's due diligence, I guess it's possible it could come up... which would suck if it's right before an equity cliff or something.<p>Another idea: I've also done 1099 contract work for big health insurance companies as a contract developer. Salaried employees had multiple background and credit checks because they were working with HIPAA Protected Health Information... so was I, but I not only made more money than the salaried employees, I didn't do an application, interview, background check, etc.<p>I think 95% of it is your attitude going in.  In your head, you're probably thinking that felony convictions are the only thing on the potential employer's mind, so you're self-conscious about it.

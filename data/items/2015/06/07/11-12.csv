9674295,comment,9673975,9673975,0,0,pjmlp,,,"Yes, there is this strange idea in new generations that GNU/Linux is UNIX, without having tried DG/UX, Tru64, Solaris, HP-UX, Aix, Irix and many others.<p>Just drop a GNU/Linux user into a default HP-UX installation and watch them getting around the system. Hint, those nice GNU flags and utilities aren&#x27;t there.<p>As for what UNIX turned out to be, I think Rob Pike as one of its creators is a good quote:<p><quote><p>I didn&#x27;t use Unix at all, really, from about 1990 until 2002, when I joined Google. (I worked entirely on Plan 9, which I still believe does a pretty good job of solving those fundamental problems.) I was surprised when I came back to Unix how many of even the little things that were annoying in 1990 continue to annoy today. In 1975, when the argument vector had to live in a 512-byte-block, the 6th Edition system would often complain, &#x27;arg list too long&#x27;. But today, when machines have gigabytes of memory, I still see that silly message far too often. The argument list is now limited somewhere north of 100K on the Linux machines I use at work, but come on people, dynamic memory allocation is a done deal!<p>I started keeping a list of these annoyances but it got too long and depressing so I just learned to live with them again. We really are using a 1970s era operating system well past its sell-by date. We get a lot done, and we have fun, but let&#x27;s face it, the fundamental design of Unix is older than many of the readers of Slashdot, while lots of different, great ideas about computing and networks have been developed in the last 30 years. Using Unix is the computing equivalent of listening only to music by David Cassidy.<p></quote><p>Taken from <a href=""http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/18/1153211/rob-pike-responds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/18/1153211/rob-pi...</a>",1433678335

9674267,comment,9673650,9674082,0,0,scriptman,,,"I&#x27;m not an expert like patio11 or others, but I think that it could be that developers aren&#x27;t always as interested in economics as they should be and this can lead to not understanding the behaviour of markets.<p>Technically, developers have to underprice their software to be successful. This is true for any product or service that you want to sell. Particularly for productivity focused software, the end user has to derive signficantly more in value than they pay in direct costs to the developer. In general, in my experience involved with b2b software/services, people want to being saving 20-30% of their time or money to strongly consider changing their existing habits.<p>The reason for this is that there are also indirect costs that the end user incurs that developers don&#x27;t always take into account in their cost models. End users incur costs in learning new software products, there are ongoing cognitive load costs in remembering how to use the product and there are opportunity costs in choosing your products over something else, not even necessarily in the same market. There is a cost that the user incurs in taking a risk that your software will solve their problem before they really understand its full capability. Even taking up an icon space on their phone/tablet/desktop has a cost to the user as it&#x27;s a place they can&#x27;t put a different app. Your app takes up harddrive space that the user has paid for and your app uses up some of their bandwidth. Finally, you aren&#x27;t just competing against other software vendors in your market, you are competing against every other thing in any market the end user might want to spend their money on. End users have a limited amount of money and time and there are a huge amount of things they can spend their money on.<p>You can&#x27;t accurately measure any of these indirect costs, but you know they are there and you can estimate them. When you take into account the indirect costs suddenly there aren&#x27;t as many dollars left on the table that developers aren&#x27;t charging for.<p>Another point is that the closer you price your software to its marginal utility to the end user, the more likely the end user is going to shop around looking for alternatives. You open yourself up to competition which could increase your marketing expenses. You could also suffer more churn, which is expensive to you.<p>The point is, you want your users feeling like they are getting amazing value from your product. You don&#x27;t want them feeling like your product costs just a bit less than the value they derive (which may seem like the most efficient price to you) because if that&#x27;s the case your business is actually teetering over a precipice and any sudden shock could push you over the edge with many customers leaving all at once. Loyal, happy customers paying you recurring revenue buffing up your cash flow is worth more than anything.",1433677775
9674266,comment,9674080,9674080,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"&quot;Human Evolution&quot; by Robin Dunbar (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/A-Pelican-Introduction-Human-Evolution/dp/0141975318"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/A-Pelican-Introduction-Human-Evolution...</a>)<p>The book is a mind-boggling journey through our own evolutionary history and delivers surprising and sometimes funny insights on many aspects of our behavior as modern humans (e.g. it attempts to explain the origins of religion, dancing and music). The beauty of the book lies in the fact that it makes you understand in detail which processes have transformed us from primates to modern humans. Truly fascinating, beautiful stuff.<p>Most people probably know Dunbar from &quot;Dunbar&#x27;s number&quot;, which relates the relative brain size of animals to the number of individuals with which they live together (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number</a>). This often (mis-)cited number is but one example of Dunbar&#x27;s ingenious, math-driven approach to many problems in biology and evolution.<p>To maximize mind-blowing capacity, combine Dunbar with Jared Diamond&#x27;s &quot;The World Until Yesterday&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Until_Yesterday"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Until_Yesterday</a>), which explains how our ancestors and many traditional tribes lived (and sometimes still live), and &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; by Richard Dawkins (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene</a>), which explains many aspects of life and social organization using mathematics and evolution theory.<p>For me, this stuff is more mysterious, thrilling and captivating than any fiction book I&#x27;ve ever read.",1433677762

Here&#x27;s an example from the docs:<p><pre><code>    curl &#x27;https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/commits?per_page=5&#x27; | \\n      jq &#x27;.[] | {message: .commit.message, name: .commit.committer.name}&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nThis outputs:<p><pre><code>    {\n      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Nicolas Williams&quot;,\n      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Add --tab and -indent n options&quot;\n    }\n    ... more JSON blobs...\n</code></pre>\nYou can output a series of individual JSON documents, or convert the output to a regular JSON array. You can also output raw lines of text to interoperate with existing tools. And this works especially well with commands like &#x27;docker inspect&#x27; that produce JSON output.<p>I think that PowerShell and jq get this right: More command-line tools should produce explicitly-structured output, and we should have powerful query and transformation tools for working with that output. For day-to-day use, I do prefer jq&#x27;s use of JSON over a binary format.",1433677534

9674198,comment,9670666,9673878,0,0,pron,,,"RCU basically works by having a critical section only within which a reader may access the data structure. To know when to GC the old copy of the data, you wait until all readers leave the critical section. If you&#x27;re in the kernel, this can be very efficient: you disable all interrupts within the CS, so you know a thread is never preempted while in it. This means that no matter how many threads there are, only those currently running on the available cores (say, there are 8 of them) can be in the CS, so no matter how many threads there are, you only need to wait for 8, and you know that that waiting period is going to be short because there are no interrupts.<p>So the efficiency of the algorithms stems from disabling interrupts within the reader&#x27;s critical section, which can only be done in kernel mode (otherwise you could do really bad things). A similar algorithm in userspace will need to find another mechanism to wait for all readers to exit the CS, which may or may not be efficient. They may share then name &quot;RCU&quot;, but not its desirable qualities.<p>There are, AFAIK, several different algorithms calling themselves userspace RCU. One userspace RCU algorithm I&#x27;ve seen  essentially protects the deallocation with a read-write, which isn&#x27;t known for terrific scalability, but I don&#x27;t know, they may have come up with something better.<p>Garbage collection is the Achille&#x27;s heel of all nonblocking data structures. As far as I know, there is no algorithm more efficient than a general purpose GC just yet, which is both generally applicable and efficient.<p>Common authorship, BTW, says little.

This is not a book, this is a neurosis you can borrow. Druidic power to the nerds.<p>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind - Julian Jaynes<p>Never mind the bulky title. The theory of Jaynes seems preposterous at first: before man was conscious he would not stop and think when making a decision, instead he would literally hear a voice telling him what to do. When life became too complicated this faculty broke down, but not in an instant. Religion is a by-product of this neuro-catastrophe. Jaynes however knows to make use of historic material in such a way that in the course of his argument he becomes plausible! If you don&#x27;t trust me on this, trust Daniel Dennett.<p>The Ghost of Chance - William S. Burroughs<p>Burroughs was a great admirer of Jaynes and here he uses the bicameral image of two dividing brain spheres as a metaphor for the divide between peaceful lemur on Madagascar and the war-mongering chimpanzee on the African mainland as a reminder that human evolution could have taken a better turn.<p>Ancient Evenings - Norman Mailer<p>This book, the only lengthy novel in this list, I first looked up because Burroughs referenced it as his inspiration for &#x27;The Western Lands&#x27;. When I noticed it starts with my favourite Yeats quote I knew I needed to read this. Even though Burroughs could never have written it like this, at times it is more Burroughs then Burroughs himself. It is the autobiography of a Ka, the lowliest soul of the seven souls of the ancient Egyptians, which makes for unusual reading. Especially because Mailer uses an uncensored version of Egyptian mythology which, to put it mildly, differs from the version you get of it from the National Geographic. The Egyptians practised sex magic with the stamina of a bonobo. Mailer makes Aleister Crowley look like a prudish schoolboy. This is the boldest attempt to recreate a radically different mind from ours that I know of, and does so successfully. The novel as the creation of an artificial consciousness. At the same time it doubles as an All American Novel (yuk).<p>The Mind in the Cave - David Lewis-Williams<p>Palaeolithic Psychedelia anyone? Close your eyes, place a finger on both of your eyelids and press gently. What you see is the origin of all art, you only need to look at rock-art with a guide like Lewis-Williams to see it.<p>The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry - Ernest Fennolosa<p>Edited by Ezra Pound, the most spectacular misunderstanding of language ever to be reprinted. It reads excellent and it gives us a language (Chinoiserie-Chinese) that does not exist in this world but should exist in a better world.<p>Vehicles - Valentino Braitenberg<p>I have read so much stuff relating to Cybernetics, AI, emergent systems and self-organization that I am totally saturated with it. The material itself is exciting but the professional obligation of science to be dull gets on my nerves. But this is an exception, wonderfully written and illustrated with funky little drawings. Vehicles is a tiny book but its size is deceptive. This introduction to synthetic psychology describes a number of simple responsive vehicles that with each new feature became aware of the world around them a good deal more. Each new vehicle is a new mind.<p>The Coleridge Notebooks.<p>Charles Lamb said he loved to lend his books to ‘Poet, Metaphysician, Bard’ Coleridge because he would return them with annotations more interesting then the book itself. Samuel Taylor Coleridge had a mind that was free, discursive, unruly and truly original. His notebooks record the flow of his thoughts as if you are sitting next to him. Every now and then I dip into this and always come out with some gem I never saw before. Get the Seamus Perry edition of this. Get a copy of the Road to Xanadu by Livingstone-Lowes for extra enjoyment.",1433676218

This became a problem when I sat some exams in adulthood: my hand cramped as I tried to scrawl as fast as possible in the time limit.<p>I deliberately investigated faster, more comfortable writing styles. Internet consensus, which I note agree with, indicated that joined-up, forward-leaning (italic) cursive was the way to go.

For example, if you have a web-based dashboard which displays the devices&#x27; state, it means that the devices will need to send that state to a central authority from time to time (in order to keep the web-based dashboard updated). Also, if you want users to interact with these devices from that dashboard, then the devices will need to receive commands from that central authority too.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at here is that in many cases, it&#x27;s more practical to make all your IoT devices talk to each other through remote servers than directly with each other because usually there is an element of &#x27;monitoring and coordination&#x27; which means that you need one or more remote servers to act as a central authority for the IoT network.<p>It may be more efficient to just make all the devices talk to each other through pub/sub hosted by a central authority than directly with each other... Unless your IoT devices are fully autonomous and that data doesn&#x27;t need to be aggregated (which, to be fair, may cover some use cases).<p>Or maybe also this could be useful if this network of devices works in isolation - For example, the dashboard connects directly with your devices without needing to coordinate with external data from devices owned by other users.",1433674846

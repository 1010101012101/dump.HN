It was the smug attitude that really got me to comment.<p>Still, I stand by my point - there are so many ways for people to offer concrete help for people in need and all I'm seeing is one-liner advices being bandied about. Especially considering the fact that Ryan seems to be a reader of your blog and already knows your advice regarding 'being rich'. He was obviously looking for more.",1241002756

I don't really want updates from all my Facebook contacts, and removing people from my feed is just not cutting it. I can be much more selective about my interests with my Twitter feed, so I actually enjoy most content I receive from it.<p>Admittedly, this is more about micro-blogging rather than keeping up with friends. Twitter can serve both purposes.",1241002632

What I said was it's one of those incredibly obvious truisms that we're taught from the age of 4. So merely stating it doesn't help 'Ryan' in any way whatsoever, since Ryan <i>already knows it.</i><p>Instead, I would have preferred to see Ramit look over Ryan's resume, whip out his rolodex and see if he can hook him up somehow, given that Ramit is in the tech field. And if he can't, direct him towards someone who can. Basically, give him some <i>actual</i> help.",1241002459

584849,comment,584797,584833,0,0,mseebach,,,"I don't agree. I've met plenty of people, especially in tech, who won't spend time broadening their horizon. At my previous job, a couple of my colleagues attitude was, ""I was hired with no experience during the .com boom, I've taught myself VB, then forced to transition to C#, and I get by fine so I don't need to know anything new.""<p>At my current job, we're doing ""boring"" J2EE stuff, but not a day goes by without someone in the office discovering something new and exciting, and talking about it. We've tried three times to crowbar some Scala into the project, just to see if it sticks (it didn't, unfortunately), we're all excited about Ruby and Python and we know how they stack up against Java.<p>That's building skills before you need them. If my colleague from the former job is fired, he will need to land exactly the same position somewhere else, while we're much better aligned to switch to something else.",1241001976

584847,comment,583801,583992,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Honestly, no, there are no good reasons behind the deletionist philosophy as currently embodied on Wikipedia.<p>The problem is that, although Wikipedia has policies for maintaining quality and relevance, they have fixated on something which is <i>not</i> a policy (notability, which is merely a guideline) and given it a status so far and above all other policies that it's hard to see as anything other than irrational extremism.<p>A good first step toward improving Wikipedia would be the utter abolition of the notability guideline, replacing it instead with the much more useful and relevant question of ""does this article present information which can be verified by consulting reliable sources?"" (see policies: WP:V, WP:RS) This maintains quality and relevance (since now the criterion is not ""I've never heard of it/it doesn't have X results in Google/etc."", but is rather ""no sources can be found to corroborate these claims""), and does away with the endless wanking over what is and isn't ""notable enough"" for Wikipedia.",1241001962

It reeks of quintessential motivational-self-help-guru-dom. It <i>sounds</i> like great advice, but when you break it down, it brings absolutely nothing concrete to the table. He might as well add 'Water is wet, so take off your clothes <i>before</i> you jump into the beach'.<p>Everyone, including 'Ryan', already knows this.<p>I would usually ignore something like this, but doling out buzzword laden one-liners like 'Networking is not a dirty word' seems to have become a trend these days. Restating the obvious in memorable sentences doesn't help anything. What <i>does</i> help is taking his resume, deciding if he can hook him up, and directing him towards a contact he knows, since he's in the same field as Ryan. You know, actual <i>concrete</i> help.<p>Or maybe it's the smug 'see how well I condense my ideas into 2 lines? that's just too cool to ignore' attitude dripping all over this self-promotional article.<p>P.S. You know what's even shorter - 'Sorry. I have no clue how to help you.' It's just <i>one</i> line!",1241001031

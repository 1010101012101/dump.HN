Even at 1:1 CAD:USD, before factoring in increased cost of living in Toronto (vs. where I am, which is not SF), I&#x27;m making close to double what I&#x27;d hope to fetch back home. If I really bust my ass and kill it where I am, the disparity is only going to grow.<p>Once you account for other factors like the increased cost of everything and the general rarity of high-paying tech jobs, returning to Toronto feels like too much of a risk: even if I were to strike relative &quot;gold&quot; and make $120k-140k+ CAD as a senior engineer (a far cry from what I get how), what happens when I move on to something else? A close, highly-talented friend of mine has one of those jobs but feels trapped and doesn&#x27;t even know where else he could go.<p>I love that the Toronto startup scene is growing and maturing and I have friends who are really working to, but I fear what&#x27;s going to happen when funding in the US begins to contract. SF, NYC, and Seattle all have profitable &quot;anchor&quot; employers which will continue to bid for talent even when startup funding won&#x27;t sustain high tech salaries. Toronto has small branch offices of American companies and some banks (I&#x27;m skeptical about the latter). Is there much else?<p>As far as I can tell there just isn&#x27;t as much good work. I want to go home some day, but as someone who was fortunate enough to land a good tech job in the US: returning is a massive step down in pay for: fewer choices of work, a more fleeting labour market, a less ambitious environment, an expensive city with overpriced real estate, and a public transit/commute crisis which might not get materially better before I retire. I really do love the place though.<p>tl;dr I&#x27;m an exceptionally fortunate Canadian spoiled by great career prospects in a major American tech hub and find it hard to justify returning home :(",1452628676

Yes, it would be very hacky, and require a lot of seemingly gratuitous work - tons of standard library functions would have to check the compatibility version of the caller and change behavior accordingly.  And the goal of cleaning up the codebase by removing things like old-style classes wouldn&#x27;t be achievable.  But what if that work had been done, and the mess accepted?<p>Then Python 3 code could use every unmodified Python 2 library (albeit potentially requiring the former to do some messy conversions between str and bytes when making calls), including the long tail of legacy libraries that will never be upgraded.  Meanwhile, once the issues in the first Python 3 release or two were straightened out, there would be very little reason to use the Python 2 <i>interpreter</i>, since the Python 3 one would be a drop-in replacement; so migration to the latter would be relatively swift, and it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a burden to ask someone to upgrade as a prerequisite to using your code.  So there would be very little reason to write new Python code in the Python 2 dialect (unless you really really hate making print a function :), and existing code could be migrated one file at a time.  Including popular libraries that wanted to maintain backwards compatibility with Python 2 programs - they would have to add compatibility checks similar to the standard library, but could otherwise go full Python 3, rather than having to use the awkward intersection of language semantics and compatibility libraries currently required.<p>With the transition so much smoother overall, native Python 3 code would probably take over relatively quickly.

For instance, Mission Bay [0] was a rail yard with no inhabitants sitting at the foot of San Francisco, just south of urban SoMa. It was a prime opportunity to make it a dense, metropolitan extension of the city with little voter backlash since there were no residents in the area. Not to mention, it is also the most accessible, commutable part of the city with 2 Caltrain stops and 2 freeway on-ramps.  Instead, they made it it a low-rise biotech neighborhood with primarily 40 ft zoning.<p>There&#x27;s another development in Downtown SF (SoMa to be exact) where current residents are suing to block the transformation of a PARKING LOT into a housing/office complex with over 200 units of affordable housing[1]. The area is already dense and urban, the building itself is not out of character (there&#x27;s a 400 ft hotel right next door). It also introduces a lot of much needed open space to Central SoMa. However, some residents in the area are suing, claiming that development would cast shadows on nearby parks (0.08775% and 0.167% of sunlight in winter months) and increase traffic to the area. The lawsuit will probably delay the development for years.

The existence of these files on my computer are in no way evidence of any infringement. Only if I were to share these files online without first securing the right to do so do I infringe. It is the act, not the file that is illegal.<p>What they mean is that digital files <i></i>can<i></i> be infringing under the right circumstance (it&#x27;s an unlicensed copy). In contrast to patents, where the actual product has to exist or the method has to be practiced. A blueprint for product is not itself infringing. I wouldn&#x27;t say that a digital file can never be infringing (because I think it could under limited circumstances when the claims are claiming a digital file), but if you have a patent on a widget, the CAD file for that widget isn&#x27;t infringing.<p>>Secondly, they are painting an incomplete picture here. You are either selling patented 3D files, which should be illegal, or you are working with them personally, which should remain legal in the spirit of promoting innovation. But what about collaboration, which requires sharing these files? 3D Printing Designers often share their designs in order to solicit feedback. What happens if I send my design to a someone on 3DHubs to have them print it for me?<p>I&#x27;m pretty pro-IP, but I think there are good reasons not to call patented 3D infringing articles. The big reason is reverse engineering.<p>I think we can handle this issue with the induced and indirect infringement law already on the books. The article points out that the alleged inducer has to know about the patent to be found liable. But that is a good thing. The last thing we need is for patent trolls to go around extorting people. It would protect people from say, molding specific products (that are marketed with a valid patent number) because that puts you on notice that there is a patent covering the product. And if someone is innocently distributing a file that infringes, then you can send them a letter informing them of the patent and they&#x27;ll be forced to stop or risk damages.",1452627254

This being another attempt to make Python2 look as old and crufty as possible. \n&quot;You&#x27;re still on Python2? Wow, I&#x27;m on 4!&quot;. That&#x27;s the type of political and psychological game the Python core dev team has been playing since 2008 with 3&#x27;s release. Right alongside the 2020 EOL, another political move. Even though Python 2.7.&#x27;10&#x27; was never supposed to exist but they went back on that.<p>This because Python3 is mere technical churn, it is not true technical innovation.<p>The issue here is really one with the Python core development team. They have also adopted every niche feature into Python3 by whoever came along to ask for it.[2] This was done for the same reasons as the relative rush to rebrand the failed 3.x branch as 4. An attempt to stir up any hype possible for 3.0+.<p>They got so much wrong with Python3. Feature soup, unicode, and performance losses over 2. Unicode-by-default is the big deal and they didn&#x27;t even get that right. They simply remapped unicode to str. Which for such a big breaking change, should&#x27;ve been UTF8 alongside other new languages such as Go.[3] But it&#x27;s worse than that, Python3&#x27;s feature soup continues in 3.6 there will likely be a 4th string formatting option[4] among throwing everything they can against the wall to see what sticks (while bloating the supposedly simple, &quot;beginners&quot; language).<p>While Python2 has been riding high in popularity[5], it has absolutely nothing to do with Python3. It&#x27;s in spite of it.<p>There&#x27;s good reason the core dev team &quot;extended support&quot; for 2.7. It&#x27;s because they really did create a new, much less successful language and would&#x27;ve lost complete control of Python had they not done it.<p>Python3 is a language that looks mostly like Python, but is Python in name-only. Worse of all, it doesn&#x27;t stand on it&#x27;s own two feet with technical merits. I would personally recommend sticking with 2 until 3 ever makes sense, or finding something else to use like Swift or Go.<p>Unlike a web browser or another piece of software, the &quot;latest version&quot; of a programming language is not always in the end-user&#x27;s best interests.<p>[0]<a href=""https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/583346987925278720"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/583346987925278720</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2014/08/python-4000.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2014/08/python-4000.h...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://learning-python.com/books/python-changes-2014-plus.html#coroutines35"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learning-python.com/books/python-changes-2014-plus.ht...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/5/12/everything-about-unicode/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/5/12/everything-about-unicode/</a><p>[4]<a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a>",1452626962

Ultimately, it&#x27;s like subclassing - neat idea, and great when it works, but often you hate life when a change at the top level cascades down and you didn&#x27;t want it to.<p>At my previous workplace, we moved to be all about semantic markup, and our CSS matched that.  Class names were to be minimized, because the structure should tell you what you need to know.  (a few classes were required, but usually just to identify different top level items).  Cascading saw heavy use, and it was generally cleaner than the specificity battles we had in legacy code where semantics weren&#x27;t used, but it required a lot of discipline.<p>At my current workplace we&#x27;re using React and BEM for CSS.  Thus we avoid referencing element tags as much as possible and instead focus on very specific class names. BEM is, as far as I can tell, a means to avoid cascading as much as possible.  Currently none of our CSS is inline.  Not much discipline is required, but we have very little reuse (Sass provides some capability for reuse)<p>I tend to prefer my previous workplace&#x27;s version, but the two are making very different kinds of products with different needs (my former place is basically building a CMS product\nand then marketing the output, whereas the current is a few single page web apps).<p>So in some scenarios cascading is an evil to be avoided, and in others it is a feature to exploit.",1452626847

As it is though, I cannot justify the cost and the increased monthly expenses. But for the sake of argument; if I did own a smartphone, I wouldn&#x27;t want to turn it into a sort of virtual keychain. I can buy three U2F keys for under €60, and have spares. Smartphones are a single point of failure — unless you are in the habit of collecting spare smartphones.<p>There is also the matter of control. At the moment there are only a handful of smartphones that run an OS that is not under the control of Apple, Microsoft, or Google (Ubuntu smartphones come to mind as an alternative). On the other hand, on a normal computer I can run a full free software stack. To me this seems odd. If I own a piece of hardware, I want to run an OS and applications I can legally modify and tinker with, especially if I use it as a security device. By using tools such as Google Authenticator I get sucked into this walled garden.<p>The behaviour of hardware tokens such as Yubico&#x27;s U2F keys on the other hand is completely verifiable — mostly because they are quite simple compared to a smartphone.<p>(Aside from these personal views on software, I do have high security requirements as well for some services, where a dedicated hardware token is preferable, as you point out.)",1452626533

The only one I can think of is Charlie Christian. So I doubt volume is a major factor in the guitar&#x27;s popularity over the saxophone in popular music.<p>I think one big thing is the versatility of the electric guitar&#x27;s sound. You can put it through different effects pedals to completely change the sound of the instrument. Wind instruments couldn&#x27;t do this until the invention of the Varitone, but even then the natural tone of the instrument is still predominant. This is probably also why synthesizers became really popular.<p>I think another big factor is that the guitar (and other rock band instruments) is more &quot;democratic&quot;. The guitar is more amenable to self-learning. It&#x27;s cheaper than a wind instrument. Even beginner saxophones are several hundred USD, whereas you can get a low-end electric guitar for pretty cheap. It&#x27;s easier to make a good sound right off the bat. Just press down a fret and pluck. No need to practice an embouchure and blowing technique. Really, the only hard part is to practice contorting your fingers into different chord positions. But rock musicians generally play a few simple chords, so this isn&#x27;t that big a deal.

One step is the source, one step implies reproducible build, and alternately specifies a stronger requirememt (source-to-object verification).<p>And no, OSS with reproducible builds is nowhere near enough for software to be trustworthy. It&#x27;s why even Orange Book had more than one sentence in its feature and assurance activities recommendations.<p>Let&#x27;s put it to the test though. If Im right, most the majority of OSS software will be similarly to proprietary full of easily-prevented holes, undocumented/barely-clear functionality, and difficulty even building it. Whereas high assurance systems would&#x27;ve had the opposite attributes while faring well during professional pentesting w/ source.<p>One of us was right for a decade straight. Maybe it&#x27;s because the principles and practices I promoted... work? Evidence in the field is on my side. Neither OSS nor good builds are enough.",1452625374

The problem is that Oakland costs about as much to develop as SF does with potential revenues that are much lower. It&#x27;s a terrible business proposition.",1452625367

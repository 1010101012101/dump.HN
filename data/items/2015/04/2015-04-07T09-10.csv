It&#x27;s fully customizable but takes about 2 weeks to ship. I&#x27;ve actually been traveling since I ordered it, finally getting it cross-shipped this week.<p>There are some crazy discounts every so often (I got a 35% off on my X250 order a couple weeks ago; I spent $1500 w/ shipping+tax for the i7-5600U CPU, 512GB SSD, 12.5&quot;FHD screen, w/ a 6-cell battery). It maxes out w/ an 8GB DIMM, but 16GB DIMMs are starting to show up and will be compatible (albeit currently quite expensive).<p>The X250 is slightly bulkier than the MBA11/XPS13, but one nice thing is that it comes w/ a built-in 3-cell battery and an additional hot-swappable 3 or 6-cell battery. Real world battery life is reported to be 6h+ with the 3+3 combo, and 10h+ with the 3+6. Lenovo claims 20h in Windows. I&#x27;m interested in running some tests but I&#x27;m confident it should last at least a work day.<p>Here are some notes I&#x27;ve gathered, both comparing various ultrabook options (I&#x27;m replacing my MBA11 after multiple generations of disappointments) as well as lots of X250 specific config notes: <a href=""https://randomfoo.hackpad.com/Lenovo-X250-Linux-CVpUMLjBDZh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://randomfoo.hackpad.com/Lenovo-X250-Linux-CVpUMLjBDZh</a>",1428400430

It&#x27;s simple, comfortable and standard. I remember how a Thinkpad 600 felt &quot;good&quot; about 15 years ago, and now I just get the same good feeling back. Maybe it&#x27;s nostalgia, but it feels quite good.<p>For my desktop computer, I have a SK8845 (same thinkpad keyboard in usb form factor), with a trackpoint + a trackpad + 5 mouse buttons all in one device. Very handy, and no window keys to bother me. You can fetch a new one off ebay for like $30. The SK8855 are expansive - a new one will set you back by $200.<p>Before that thinkpad keyboard, still in a membrane, I enjoyed the Apple raised USB keyboard- not the contemporary aluminum chiclet keyboard, the plastic one.

9332827,comment,9332557,9332557,0,0,zamalek,,,"> The best thing about typing on a mechanical keyboard, by far, is the sound.<p>The satisfaction for the sound is most likely a result of the tactile feedback. The &#x27;clackiest&#x27; switches tend to also have the most pronounced tactile feedback. Pinning it to sounds is misrepresenting the advantages of mechanical keyboards and makes them sound like a novelty (which they are definitely not).<p>The satisfaction of mechanical keyboards comes from the feedback of knowing when the key has been pressed: enthusiasts claim (and I agree) that bottoming out keys is tiring for your fingers. The tactile response helps build muscle memory toward this goal.<p>One of the most sought after switches (Cherry MX Clear) are evidence of this: they are almost silent but have a strong tactile response.<p>> I’m not sure how my Das Keyboard 4 stacks up against the competition.<p>For a typist (or programmer) the switch is the most important feature of a keyboard. A Cherry MX Brown feels the same no matter which keyboard it is featured on - the only discerning feature on keyboards is their build and operational features (such as NKRO on gaming keyboards).<p>One final point: it might be a better idea to stick to a single type of switch everywhere. Mechanical keyboards are about building muscle memory - having different switches (which have different activation forces) probably works against you building it. I the long run your muscles will learn, but you will hit the plateau faster if you stick to one switch.",1428400178

9332821,comment,9332223,9332223,0,0,pdkl95,,,"A lot of you seem to be <i>assuming</i> the EO applies only to people outside the US. It would be a good idea to actually read the EO, which is NOT restricted to people outside the US.<p>From the EO[1], reformatted to show clause structure:<p><pre><code>    Section 1
        (a) All property and interests 
            ... of the following persons
            ... are blocked
            (i) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury
                ... to have engaged in
                ... directly or indirectly,
                ... any activity originating form,
                                 or directed by
                                 ... persons located outside the United States
                that are reasonably likely to result in
                ...a significant threat to national security
                                           ...or economic health
                ...of the united states.
</code></pre>
This language targets &quot;any person&quot; that meets some shockingly vague criteria[2] by few government officials[3]. The clause with &quot;outside the United States&quot; is not describing the person being targeted by the EO; that language is a detail about the type of activity that the targeted person is doing.<p>If the attack is directed by someone outside the US, and you are determined to be indirectly &quot;engaged in&quot; or &quot;complicit with&quot; that that activity, you are targeted by this clause. Neither you nor the attack itself need to be outside the US, as long as it is directed by someone that is outside the US.<p>What kinds of activities? In a previous thread I mentioned[4] how the EO doesn&#x27;t prohibit harming &quot;critical infrastructure&quot;, but instead prohibits:<p><pre><code>    Section 1 (a) (i)
        (A) harming, or otherwise significantly compromising
            a computer or network of computers that support
            ... the provision of service
            ... in a critical infrastructure sector

        (C) causing a significant disruption to the availability
            of a computer or network of computers
</code></pre>
Note that section (C) does <i>not</i> limit itself to a &quot;critical infrastructure sector&quot;.<p>There are so many vague and undefined terms in this EO, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this EO could be used against some kid that is &quot;indirectly&quot; engaging in a DDOS[5] being run by some *chan troll outside the US.<p>Also note: the EO doesn&#x27;t mention the SDN list at all.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1699240/executive-order-obama-establishes-sanctions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1699...</a><p>[2] &quot;reasonably likely to result in&quot;? seriously?<p>[3] those officials, by the way, can delegate the power according to Sec 8 of the EO<p>[4] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9320343"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9320343</a><p>[5] does github-attack style injected javascript count?",1428400123

(For people over 50, and for African-Americans, the current recommended intake is even lower - 1,500 milligrams per day.)<p>If the U.S. salt warnings are correct, Americans are indeed endangering themselves on a massive scale. Americans typically go way over the limit, ingesting about 3,500 milligrams per day.<p>If the skeptics are correct, on the other hand, most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks.

I&#x27;ve currently been scouring, trying to find something I can be happy developing on for the next 5+ years.<p>The big selling features for me [and most developers, I&#x27;d assume] are the screen and the keyboard. These 2 things are my feedback loop for developing, and need to be of a certain quality or I&#x27;ll feel &#x27;off&#x27;.<p>I find so many companies get close to creating my ideal development laptop, only to lack in critical ways.<p>While I don&#x27;t detest them, I find a lot of island style keyboards don&#x27;t provide a resistance for typing. The scissor switches under the beveled keys on the older Thinkpads left me with a good experience for long periods of typing. Feeling that resistance is so much nicer than pushing flat tabs down (most often on spongy keys).<p>I do understand a lot of people watch movies on their laptops, but unless a screen is 1080 or higher, I find a 16:9 ratio screen limiting. My 12 inch SXGA+ screen goes up to 1050px height. Almost all &quot;modern&quot; screens are 16:9 and only go up to 900px height for the ~12&quot; width. So unless a company makes a 1080 12&quot; laptop, I still feel I&#x27;m missing out on those extra 150 pixels.<p>Soldering RAM, SSDs, etc. to the mobo. Like was mentioned here, &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; is everywhere, but I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. My old x61 Thinkpad still performs beautifully, even after nearly 8 years of service. Why? Because 8GB of RAM is still a nice thing to have, even if DDR2 RAM is mind blowingly expensive. And the ability to change wifi cards, throw in a CrystalHD card to play videos on, or just switch to an SSD. These little upgrades help keep my old workhorse alive, and makes me wish Lenovo would come out with an upgraded version, rather than changing to just hit the wider market of people.<p>And this is what it comes down to, I feel. So many companies blindly target the lowest-threshold-needs to hit the widest target group; not really thinking (or maybe just not caring) that every other company is doing the same thing. Perhaps it&#x27;s the notion that 5% of a $1bn market is bigger than 80% of a $50mm.

The lonely, like the fictional, love one-way watching. For lonely people are usually lonely not because of hideous deformity or odor or obnoxiousness—in fact there exist today social and support groups for persons with precisely these features. Lonely people tend rather to be lonely because they decline to bear the emotional costs associated with being around other humans. They are allergic to people. People affect them too strongly. Let&#x27;s call the average U.S. lonely person Joe Briefcase. Joe Briefcase just loathes the strain of the self-consciousness which so oddly seems to appear only when other real human beings are around, staring, their human sense-antennae abristle. Joe B. fears how he might appear to watchers. He sits out the stressful U.S. game of appearance poker.<p>&quot;But lonely people, home, alone, still crave sights and scenes. Hence television.

</code></pre>
Now Commit 3 is the HEAD of your current branch (master, trunk, default, whatever). The way I understand your &quot;problem&quot; is if you want to create a new branch based on an older, non-HEAD commit.<p>For instance you checkout the current branch on based on the state of the branch as per &quot;Commit 2&quot;, and make a new Commit &quot;Commit 4&quot;. This creates a new implicit branch:<p><pre><code>    - Commit 1 -> Commit 2 +-> Commit 3 (master/default)
                           +-> Commit 4 (implicit branch) - new current branch
</code></pre>
Now you have two branches. How do you switch between them? How do you operate on those branches? Do you cycle them? Do you have to remember the last commit-message of a branch to find it again?<p>To be absolutely clear: What I&#x27;m curious about is how do you relate to and navigate between branches when they are all anonymous?

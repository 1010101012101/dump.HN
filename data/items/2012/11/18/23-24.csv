Theoretically it is possible to use a four-base codons, but I'm almost sure that it is extremely difficult to make all the changes in every part of the process. For example, to change the number of bases in a codon, you must change the number of bases in the reciprocal part of the tRNA. But the shape of the tRNA depends on the length, and it seems to be very difficult to change this without breaking the other functions.<p>It's much easier just to change the meaning of some codons (there are 64, and only 20 codified aminoacid + a termination mark), and even the mitochondrias and some estrange living organism have small changes in the genetic code.",1353282888

It's nice if they are, but being able to run a software product is not the most important thing for a potential president to run.<p>However, that doesn't mean lessons can't be gleamed and abstracted. The President has to outsource a lot of knowledge and work. Presidents are typically experts at something, but not at most things. President Obama is a former Constitutional Law Professor. It's reasonable to assume that he understands Constitutional Law at a very high level; it's also reasonable to assume that Constitutional Law is one of the few things that he has a very high level of expertise at.<p>All Presidents have to work with other experts and teams to get things done. The fact that Governor Romney's tech teams failed so badly can be looked at a mark of his management abilities. He doesn't need to be a tech expert, but he does need to know how to put the right people in place to be successful.<p>I look at these failings as a case study as to what could of happened with other areas Governor Romney could have had to outsource: defense leadership, diplomacy, transportation policy and vision, etc.<p>At some point, you can't pass the buck.

There definitely are, for instance, women who are fantastic programmers and would give amazing talks, but they may not be able to make the conference.

In reality, this is often because there's been no effort made to reach out to other segments of society.<p>The tokenism excuse is then deployed - but that isn't the point. No-one likes tokenism. The argument we're making is that there are talented people who get overlooked or are made to feel excluded (often accidentally) because they aren't white men.<p>I find it incredibly offensive when people deploy the tokenism argument against this criticism because the implicit claim is that there aren't enough talented members of minority groups.

As such, I have great affection for both countries. In both countries one is innocent until proven guilty.<p>It is not unheard of, of someone having to fight the good fight against great odds and the occasional corrupt public servant causing grievance.  I also assure you the average Indian is <i>not</i> corrupt, and since the those in public service are selected from the same average Indians, they are not as you have repeatedly in these 2 threads made them out to be.<p>To execute an arrest in India requires the police to file a FIR (First information report) and for a judge to approve an arrest warrant on the basis of information in the FIR. Much like in the US, there are jurisdictional rules governing state and federal oversight. Your friend was arrested in the state of Maharashtra and taken to the state of Delhi. Given these facts, you are claiming collusion among multiple state and federal agencies and judiciary, acting out on blatantly false information in an FIR.<p>From having spent 24 years in India in a upper middle class family, I can assure you from anecdotal evidence that I never crossed paths with anyone in a position so powerful to exert such clout. It quite simply is the case that people with such clout rarely if ever socialize in places that most people do.<p>All of this begs the question why and how did your friend come to be involved with such people and why her support structure is so poor as for having you to make a public request for help. More over all information in this matter is in the public domain the moment a FIR was filed and can be obtained by anyone with a request under the auspices of right to information act.<p>The very fact that you received help from the very people raised in the same society that you claim to be corrupt should make you reevaluate you belief in the account of events you have received.<p>In summary, I'm sorry I <i>don't</i> believe your account of corruption and discrimination without basis against your friend. They is likely an element of truth in what you say but your account is almost certainly skewed. I also <i>do</i> believe that your friend is innocent until proven guilty.<p>I request you to immediate <i>STOP</i> your innuendo on account of hearsay against a country I hold dear",1353280187

Certainly less time than it took you to write this big response, where you agree with me but lament that what I wrote above is just too much damn work.<p>Really, even if you won't do it for this blog post, just change the wording to ""Follow me on Twitter"".

My impression is that VCs are never in the dividends business.<p>Wouldn't there have to be a fair amount of upfront and unique legal legwork to put something like this in place, in order to not only compensate the VCs, but also to attract quality employees in lieu of stock options? Would the investors and employees be guaranteed a certain percentage of any money Carson takes out of Treehouse? Do VCs who would accept this kind of deal even exist?<p>I'm pretty much allergic to the idea of answering to a board, shareholders, and analysts myself. 37 Signals seems to have an interesting idea about how to compensate employees in the unlikely case of an unexpected liquidity event, but some sort of structure that would allow profit sharing, without requiring a path to IPO or acquisition, would be great:<p>http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2987-an-alternative-to-employee-optionsequity-grants",1353279935

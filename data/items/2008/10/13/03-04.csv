330721,comment,330470,330600,0,0,tptacek,,,"Agree, networking is over-emphasized. We did a lot of networking at the outset, with no particular plan or strategy, and it doesn't feel like time well spent.<p>Not sure I'm saying ""my kind of networking meets X times per month"", but I will say this: we organized monthly meetups for the professionals in our market (computer/network security), made it as all-inclusive as we could, and it's been far more valuable to us than the vanity networking we did early on.<p>Isn't this one of the major recurring criticisms of valley culture? That all those people do is go to parties with the same people every night?",1223870213
330720,comment,330470,330704,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Even if you're a top-notch developer, it still takes an order of magnitude more time to develop an actual product than to put up a product description and a few mockups, and you can still expect 90% of your products to fail.  You can easily spend <i>years</i> of development time on products that nobody wants.  Why waste all that talent?<p>I had/have the same aversion to selling things that don't exist that you have.  But honestly, I think that the next time I do a startup, I'm going to do it that way.  I get really sick of speculatively building things that nobody wants.  Why not make sure they want it first and then build it?<p>Plus, two of my favorite startups - DropBox and RescueTime - both used this approach (though perhaps with a little less dishonesty - they clearly marked it ""demo""), and their products are better for it.",1223869992

There are going to be a lot of people that disagree with what I'm saying in my posts and probably would want to steer clear of me. Then again hopefully there will be a few interesting people that I get to connect with through this that I wouldn't have otherwise, and that is worth it to me.<p>I think you should be blogging :)",1223869650

330713,comment,330470,330711,0,0,tptacek,,,"""I wouldn't step down as CEO to keep a team together that did not want to be together"". You use this word ""CEO"" as if it means something. It doesn't.<p>In a three-person (or two-person, by the time this particular piece of drama came to a head) company, there is a team, and there are players, and if the team is running well there's a team lead --- who's there because the team believes they'll function better with a leader. If the team wants to sound ""all grown up"", they'll call the leader a ""CEO"". My team still doesn't call Dave the CEO.<p>Using the word ""CEO"" in this situation is a ""tell"". Think about what you're saying.",1223869560
330712,comment,330470,330621,0,0,mroman,,,"If that person does not exist, then one needs to be hired eventually, as it would be better to wait than to have a person not adept at the task doing it wrong.<p>I am sure that some are better than others at networking, my point was (minus my admittedly harsh figurative description) that high intelligence and knowledge are best applied to something that mandates intelligence, as opposed to something that does not mandate a high level of intelligence and knowledge. Those kinds of activities (networking, sales, marketing) do not mandate exceptional intelligence, from what I have seen those mostly require innate skill and experience. Many people can network, sell, and market. Not many can code.<p>Now, I mentioned more than coding when I referred to what I believe creates value, however I will respond to your point by saying that \n1) creating value is conducive to attracting attention IMO\n2) I did not state that there should be no networking/marketing/promotion at all, I wrote that it should not be done before a product is ready, and that it should be done by someone adept at it (usually not a propeller head like me, for example, although I am sure some guys are skilled at those activities as well as tech work)",1223869344
330711,comment,330470,330694,0,0,orianmarx,,,"I don't really think this is fair, but I can see why it can come across that way. I wouldn't step down as CEO to keep a team together that did not want to be together. This is not to be confused with being unable to step aside for someone who is more suited for the position. That wasn't what was going on here.<p>I placed a great deal of trust in my team for nearly a year and some of that came back to bite me. Yes I did list a lot of flaws, but they were not flaws that everyone had in common, they were the things that stood out to me as being problematic across the length of the venture and, well, I thought I mentioned a lot of things I thought I should do differently. But I am open to hearing more.",1223869189

I'm in the middle of a major release or I'd respond more-- yet, I'm perplexed to come here and see so many people being negative regarding the post. It takes a lot of guts to work on something feverishly for so long and then put things even more on the line afterwards for a post-mortem. It's nothing but good information for people to take in and learn from.<p>Kudos to you for sharing.",1223868993

330704,comment,330470,330625,0,0,mroman,,,"Well, I don't disagree that things can be done that way, but I do not think it is the right thing to do, for several reasons. Why learn to design/program just to pull a total suit move and sell vaporware/vaporproducts? If that is what you want to do, then just fake sell as you said, and then hire a few coders from India who can put whatever together for peanuts and then call that good (I would not be able to sleep at night ever after however). Also, those kinds of maneuvers are best left to suits - who are good at those kinds of things - instead of tech people, who are normally better at building things as opposed to pulling marketing maneuvers.",1223868362

330698,comment,330521,330578,0,0,kirse,,,"I think it's sheer ignorance to believe that this current economic situation is just going to ""blow over"" like the last recession we had.<p>We're not just going to spend and leverage our way out of this one (as we have with previous recessions) because the trust and confidence in credit is extremely shaky.  The last 30 years, since about 1980, have been fueled by a ridiculous amount of credit and the bills are coming due.<p>It's now an issue of people and their confidence.  The whole system of credit works because of trust, and with each bank failure and company fallout confidence is going to drop.  This isn't just consumer confidence too, but also confidence on the part of foreign countries to believe that we'll make good on our insane level of debt.<p>We haven't had a negative quarter or high unemployment yet because 2008 just marked the significant beginning of this erosion of confidence and the revaluing of the massive bullshitting of on-paper ""value"" created by abnormal demand (fueled by credit).  This ""confidence crunch"" is far from over.",1223867677

330695,comment,330470,330664,0,0,mroman,,,"I agree that vaporware has been successfully marketed before, however, that is not my idea of creating value, so I agree that it depends on how one defines value, and I would not want that - marketing non-existent products - to become the meaning of value within the context of a tech startup, that is best left to a marketing/publicity outfit if you ask me. I also think it is wrong to conduct market studies under the guise of a real product offer.<p>What happens when it turns out that the bullet points with features cannot be implemented, or are simply not the best solution for the users?<p>I find pg's thoughts on the subject of how problems may end up being redefined as they are being worked on to be very wise advice.",1223867250
330694,comment,330470,330487,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"A professor told us at the start of grad school that the secret to success was to be ""humble, gracious, and hard-working"". I see only one of those three qualities in the author.<p>Here we have a CEO that refuses to step down to keep the company together, that gets two votes in group decisions while his partners gets one, and that places all the blame for failure on his cofounders when things go south. The arrogance approaches the comical, it becomes more and more outrageous as one reads along.<p>What is the first lesson he learned? ""Getting the team right"". You see, he had a bad TEAM. That explains the company failure. Yep. Not him. Nothing to do with the guy that chased away perfectly competent people that wanted to work with him. Nothing to do with the guy IN CHARGE.<p>Leadership is a two way street. You can't have control without responsibility! I don't think there is any team that wants to work with that kind of leader. You will never ""get the team right"" if you see your position that way!<p>His second ""lesson learned"" is to connect with people, and by ""people"" he means networking with potential investors, advisors, other businessmen, etc. Yet he never connected with his own teammates!<p>Next, he finally finds fault in his own leadership. You see, he is too much of a consensus seeker so he can't get things done quick enough! Obviously, he places too much trust in his cofounders. THAT is what he believes his problem is.<p>Then there's this little gem: ""Then I decided not to take Paul Graham’s advice to make the other partner our CEO for the sake of civility (a decision I stand by fully), which effectively ended the company."" You would rather your company fail than not be in charge? What kind of leader is that? You still stand by the decision that killed the company? What does that say about you?<p>Good leaders are famous for taking credit for failure, even when it is not entirely their fault. They also DON'T take credit for success. They let others give the credit to them unbidden. That's what causes their subordinates to at first respect them, and eventually love them.<p>Dear author: does that sound like you?<p>I'm sorry if I'm a little harsh; as I read this it is blowing my mind a little more with every paragraph.",1223867177

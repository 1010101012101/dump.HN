Knuth\n</code></pre>\nI think it's perfectly fine to approach many problems with PHP, ASP.NET, Python or any number of solutions as long as the problem is solved in a way that meets the requirements.  Not every problem needs to handle millions of queries per second at the lowest latency and best cost possible.  The speed from ""problem"" to ""solution"" can be many times faster offsetting the potential cost of running a couple extra servers to soak up the inefficiencies of the system.<p>That said in my field of work we see 40 Billion transactions daily with Million query per second spikes.  In that world you can't afford to deploy 10,000 servers running a nice django server.  You need to dive deeper and deeper, ending up with front-line servers written in C and optimizing with non-locking data structures and sweating over memory fences and cache lines.  This however is a rare slice of the total problem set that programmers have to face every day.<p>IMHO it's the power curve of cpu power and resource availability that creates a wider and wider gap between low level, low latency, high scale programmers and many programmers who ""get stuff done"" perfectly fine every day of the week.<p>I have posted before on HN about the strange patterns that are emerging around the shift to ""post-desktop"" era, and this trend is also another topic of interest to me.

5013311,comment,5012590,5013080,3,0,jules,,,"Remember that dating works much like a market. There is supply and demand, and since there are about as many men as women, the supply and demand is roughly equal. But in some places this ratio is not equal. I'm not sure about dating sites, but that could be such a place. Simplifying a lot: if there are 1000 women and 2000 men then the women will date the 1000 most attractive men, and the rest have basically no chance. You need to find a place where the numbers are reversed.<p>The good thing about dating being a market is that you <i>can</i> find somebody. The thing is that you have to place your standards around your level of attractiveness or lower. Contrary to the popular romantic image of a non attractive male dating a very attractive female, almost all relationships happen between people of very similar attractiveness. You may be less popular height wise, so you might need to compromise on an attribute that makes a woman less popular (e.g. weight or age). Perhaps you have decided that the compromises you would have to make are too great, and you'll rather stay single instead. That's fine too, but it's a choice.<p>You also have some control over your attractiveness. You have some control over physical attractiveness with clothes, sport and grooming. Fortunately for you, for men physical attractiveness and age are not of overriding importance they pretty much are for women. As you note, confidence and social status are also very important (see Berlusconi for an extreme example). These are things you can work on! Intelligence is important too, and you're probably already doing quite well on that front.",1357407625

There's three states: ""I liked this"", in which you up-vote, ""I didn't like this"", in which you ignore it, and ""I didn't like this"", in which you down-vote. Even reddiquette dictates that it should only be used for anything that doesn't contribute.

5013252,comment,5012657,5013166,12,0,ryanmolden,,,"This was probably taken from the work of Carol Dweck[0]. I recently read a book she wrote (Mindset[1]) that was recommended on a thread here. The book title sounds like some corny self-help book, and honestly some of the stories in it seemed a bit sappy to me, but I think the underlying idea is solid and I definitely see it myself a lot in my day to day life (full disclosure: recovering fixed mindset person :)).<p>The basic premise is there are two types of mindsets, a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. Those with the fixed mindset are those that believe that intelligence, ability, etc.. is basically fixed. You have some certain amount and that's that. The growth mindset believes the general range of these things may be strongly influenced ('fixed') by things like genetics, life circumstances, etc... but improvement within this range is definitely possible and the key to that is hard work and honest assessment of where you are relative to where you want to be.<p>This relates to the achievement vs. hard work thing because she claims children who are praised for 'being smart' or 'being good at X' tend to gravitate towards the fixed mindset (i.e. 'I get praised because I am smart, I am smart because I can do X well/X comes easily to me, if something doesn't come easily to me it must mean I am not smart/talented'). This causes them to not put in effort when the going gets tough and in fact to avoid challenges because if they fail they view it as a judgement on their core self/competency (not simply an indication of an area for growth).<p>The growth mindset folks (children praised for doing well because they worked hard at it as opposed to some natural talent or 'smarts') tend to seek challenges as they view them as the engine of growth/improvement.<p>Using these frameworks as a lens on which to view human behavior can be interesting. I have definitely seen both mindsets in action (in myself and others). I definitely , consciously, try to stay in a growth mindset now, but I think our culture heavily pushes a fixed mindset where someone either has 'it' or they don't, they are smart or they are not, they are talented or they are not. We prefer the 'instant success due to massive talent/smarts' story over the 'worked their ass off for years to build amazing talent and then succeeded due to that hard work'.<p>The book Talent Is Overrated[2] also touches on this and points out most people that we generally consider 'naturals' at things, if you interview them/study them/look at their past, all have something in common, a tremendous amount of effort in learning/training, above and beyond what most people put in. This also veers towards the 10,000 hour theory of Anders Ericsson[3]<p>EDIT: Fixed a bunch typos/misspelling I saw in re-reading. Originally typed in IE with no spell check.

The occupational world is interested only in treating one as a fungible resource. The world doesn't really care about many individuals, and they probably won't make an effort to validate them unless they do something remarkable.<p>Instead of trying to asses his merit through artificial criteria or measurements, he should strive for internal validation. He should find what makes him feel good, and pursue it. This is distinct from what <i>brings him pleasure.</i> Pursuing only pleasure had, in his case, turned out poorly. Moreover, I think that strict hedonism isn't congruous with the human condition: everyone needs aspirations and accomplishments.<p>On the education system: yeah, it's a mess. The chief problem is its inefficiency. I recall statistic stating that 70% of knowledge learned in school is lost throughout one's lifetime, and that only 3% is actively applied in one's day-to-day life or occupation. I'm not sure about the veracity of this, but I think that, regardless of the actual numbers, it's a fairly intuitive conclusion that the education system is a travesty.<p>This is derived from the increasing specificity as one ascends our various educational institutions. The foundational information: basic arithmetic, introductory english skills, ect. are applicable to almost all careers and lifestyles. Then, as science and history are thrown in and math becomes more complex, the content begins to lose its applicability. Then, at the secondary level, the information becomes so esoteric as to practically useless to everyone.  Calculus is used in an incredibly small number of occupations, and could safely be relegated to the collegiate level. And yet, it is arguable the centerpiece of the education system.<p>The same could be said about lab science.<p>English, on the other hand, is a pivotal educational domain that is pertinent to one's success throughout school, but focuses on the wrong things. The various structures and constructs of english are emphasized, while the application is marginalized. If anything, the former belies the true nature of language: to communicate effectively. And yet, so little actual communication is done throughout schools as to be laughable. I recall never being given more than 1-2 essays per semester throughout middle and early high school. It's illogical to impress the specifics of the english language on students without compelling them to use those specifics. This is why I love my current english course: it focuses almost exclusively on argumentative analysis and writing.<p>The issue is not that these academic domains are unto themselves valueless or that they should not be taught. On the contrary, I find most of my courses to be incredibly edifying, and that even superfluous information has innate value. However, the function of the education system is not to instill knowledge for knowledge's sake, but to produce capable individuals prepared for the real world.",1357406540

See Ada2012 for example. Also optional unsafe/unmanaged code blocks can really help with maintaining performance in critical parts while keeping the non-critical parts safe/managed. This goes as far as optional garbage collecting for certain objects and manual for others. Flexibility, none of which C provides and which makes C a horrible language in todays world.<p>If only someone would start re-writing de-facto low-level infrastructure such as kernels(say Linux) and userspace tools and programs(servers such as apache, implementations such as for Python and Ruby, libraries, ...) in something like Rust or equivalent which <i>guarantees</i> both type and memory safety and has strong emphasis on concurrency and encourages immutable state etc.<p>Maybe one day we simply don't have to care so much about what's ""secure"" and what's ""vulnerable"".

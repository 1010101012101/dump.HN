6163708,comment,6161954,6163220,5,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> I would love to see stats on how many people who have taken Mattan&#x27;s class have gone on to actually having a career as a developer. I&#x27;m willing to bet it&#x27;s 1% or less. But prove me wrong, please.<p>I think the question is even broader than that: how many people who buy into these programs will be working as developers in five or ten years?<p>I&#x27;m a self-taught programmer, so I know first-hand that you don&#x27;t need a computer science degree to learn how to build web applications that provide value to real people. But I think some of the programs out there aren&#x27;t realistic about what it takes to become a <i>decent</i> developer over the long haul.<p>In my opinion the viability of the 0-to-$120,000 in <i>x</i> months pitch is primarily a function of the <i>current</i> market and little else. The bad news: the market is not static, and when the next downturn arrives, a lot of jobs that exist today will likely go away, even if the tech industry doesn&#x27;t see a precipitous drop in jobs overall.<p>A couple of points on this:<p>1. A lot of people in tech today didn&#x27;t live through the first .com boom, or if they did, have chosen to forget it. There was a very similar dynamic: tons of people rushed to learn HTML, web design, etc. If you lived in the Bay Area and knew how to, say, code an HTML table, chances were you could land a high-paying job at a startup. Post-crash, a good number of these .com refugees left technology, moved into non-technical roles or went back to school.<p>2. If you&#x27;re serious about a career as a developer, it&#x27;s wise to consider what you choose to learn. From what I see personally, a lot of the demand for Ruby on Rails developers comes from &quot;startups.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with that, but somebody just starting out who hopes to be employed as a well-paid developer five years from now shouldn&#x27;t assume that knowing how to develop a Rails CRUD app with a Bootstrap front-end is a perpetual guarantee of a six-figure salary. As you note, there&#x27;s more to development than a framework, but frameworks do so much these days that new developers often see little incentive to go beyond the framework.",1375743101

We seem to have failed to do that in an entirely rational way but the lightning - terror comparison seems invalid. Probably better to compare it with preventable deaths from some cause like car accidents or pool drownings (which is probably even worse for the anti-terror lobby) and which might get out of hand unless there is active prevention.

I&#x27;m not here to troll, I&#x27;m here to push you to <i>be better</i>.<p>I think you haven&#x27;t interpreted the word &quot;scam&quot; correctly. I believe that you have good intentions, but regardless of that, this product is dishonest. It says it will teach you how to be a rails developer, and it doesn&#x27;t do that. It implies that you will be ready for six figure salaries after taking the course, and you won&#x27;t. I know that you would call this &quot;marketing&quot;, and sure it has worked. But what are you after in building this company? Money slash success, or the core <i>reasons</i> that you set out to build this company? You know - you mission: to really teach people how to code.<p>I think what you might be missing is that you don&#x27;t learn how to code by cloning popular websites, and copy-pasting code someone else hands you. You learn to code by understanding how things work. Understanding how computers work sure helps. Understanding how the ruby language works helps too. Understanding how the web works, how databases work... all the things I mentioned in my previous comment. Then you take this general knowledge of how things work to build what <i>you</i> want, whatever that is -- whether it&#x27;s a clone of a popular app (which it never is) or something entirely new and custom that nobody else has done (which is always the case).<p>I&#x27;m sure you are familiar with the flatiron school in NYC. They have a similar mission, but are actually doing it right (to be fair, also charging a hell of a lot more). You guys both approach the same problem, but get vastly different results. In the flatiron school, you spend full time for months learning and understanding how things work, and when you come out of it, you get a full-time job as a developer. In one month rails, you spend a couple weeks on and off watching online videos that skip all the underlying theory and come out with a low-quality pinterest clone and not even close to enough skills to land an internship.<p>What is your goal for one month rails? To make money, or to add real value to peoples lives? To have techcrunch articles written about you, or to actually promote the incredible mindset and skills that are building, creating, writing code? I think we both know that you are aimed after the wrong thing, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m pushing you to do it right.",1375741358

(Although frankly I don&#x27;t know what the relative percentages are, it&#x27;s not as though Anwar al-Awlaki was a one-off.) Still, when we have a public discussion, only public information is relevant. You can&#x27;t base an academic work on &quot;secret&quot; information. Within the NSA, this analysis is probably old hat. I&#x27;m pretty sure some of the geniuses know queuing theory.<p>The comparison between lightning and &quot;terror&quot; emphasizes that security is a game of trade-offs. Although this is one of the basic mantras of computer security, we rarely hear it from those employed at public expense. Why do they have a different emphasis? We do spend some money on lightning protection, and most of us do use caution to avoid lightning-prone situations. Each of those costs is a pittance compared to those of the War On Terror.<p>Really though, since lightning is not a sentient opponent who changes his tactics in response to human action, the more fair comparison in TFA is to violence in general. While that has dropped precipitously for decades, credit is given by many to the tyrannical police state we&#x27;ve built to match our tyrannical security state, so the proper amount to spend is still &quot;more&quot;. LEOs are just as unlikely as NSA people to raise questions of priorities and trade-offs.<p>If this were a dilemma the USA political system could solve, it probably would have been solved already for both of these cases.

This is because Age !== Experience. Perl has been around longer than Python, but it sounds like you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it. Granted, Node.js is still considered <i>fairly</i> new, but remember - it <i>was</i> released in 2009. We&#x27;re a few months away from 2014, and this has been more than enough time for Node.js to mature just enough to be suitable in a production web app.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating the use of one over the other for you (personally I&#x27;d go with Node because my expertise in it outweighs my expertise in Python), I&#x27;m simply stating my opinion that these are not valid reasons to disregard the technology. The Node.js community is bustling, the amount of modules available on NPM are in the tens of thousands, and many open source projects use it (Yeoman, Grunt, Stylus, Jade, Roole, LESS, Bower, CoffeeScript to name a few).<p>Development speed is likely the most probable of your points, but even so - you can write a Node.js app in CoffeeScript, which you might be more inclined to do since your love of Python is so prominent, and CoffeeScript borrows many ideas from Python, such as significant whitespace and chained comparisons. A manual compile step isn&#x27;t necessary as this feature can be done by most IDE&#x27;s implicitly. Express.js also helps big time.<p>The only reason I would use Python over Node (if I was in your position <i>and</i> actually knew enough Python) would be if the web app in question required intensive mathematical or scientific calculations - Python would shine over Node in that respect.",1375740581

You won&#x27;t kill procrastination tomorrow or anytime in the future, you can only develop habits that will be harder to break after some time. 
I like to see myself as an abstinent - it can come back anytime and therefore I stick to my routines and avoid any situations leading to procrastination. It&#x27;s a life long process in my eyes and only consistence leads to change.<p>What helped me was to develop a morning routine - I started with making my bed. Every day. I know myself - if I leave out one day I will leave out second day too and eventually fail. After a while I added cold shower, 2 glasses of water, workout, 5 min meditation and a healthy breakfast - to cut it short I have been working out every morning for last 6 months, not missing a single day.<p>I created an excel sheet where I track if I miss the routine or not, the time I spend working and the time I spend studying something.  I have it done for 9 weeks all on one paper - it works better that having a daily to do list because you can see your progress and how you&#x27;ve been doing so far, unlike with daily to-do where you can quickly forget you wasted last monday. ( I have it printed out - and I put it on a visible place. It works better, because once I turn on the notebook I get distracted about wanting to check my email and what to do next. I keep this stuff strictly offline )<p>After 9 weeks I sum it up and take a week off. Over the last year my net working hours have increased 500% and so has my income.<p>Another thing that helped was to change environment, clean up stuff, email, desktop the room, throw things out. I have put a K9 on my pc blocking porn, youtube, facebook, quora and every medium where I can read something about politics. I threw out the password and blocked even the email provider I have my backup email on. Sounds ridiculous right. Well I feel liberated, I just don&#x27;t have to fight with the temptation anymore and it saves a lot of energy. And most importantly I actually do what I love doing every day. My life is much better since then. It also forced me to spend my time more meaningfully.<p>Also note that I tried many things before and most have failed. This is what eventually worked for me as an individual ( yes my procrastination was that bad, I had to get that radical ) I remember feeling so hopeless I actually thought I won&#x27;t change ever in my life, that I am doomed to be lazy.

Most of us deal with the police so infrequently that, in that adversarial context, we have very little practice on how to do it effectively. Worse yet, asserting your rights appears to violate many of the social strictures on not being rude and respecting authority. Quoting Sen no Rikyu, &quot;that must be set aside&quot;.",1375740155

I personally love the typical flavor of oil from Kalamata olives, which makes up a large part of the Greek-labeled production (i.e. bottled as Greek olive oil, rather than exported for blending).<p>Greek marketing and distribution has been poor, however, and very slowly improving. The traditional place to buy it in the U.S. has been in 5-liter tins at Mediterranean grocery stores catering to immigrants (depending on the region, these might be &quot;Greek&quot;, &quot;Lebanese&quot;, &quot;Turkish&quot;, or &quot;Arab&quot; supermarkets). These are a great deal, especially if you cook with it, but off the radar of most regular shoppers. Lately I have been seeing it in smaller bottles in normal grocery stores more often. Trader Joe&#x27;s now has a house brand of 100% Greek Kalamata olive oil, which they buy in bulk and bottle, and is very good for the price.<p>This is one thing the Italians got way out front of the Greeks on. Both Italians <i>and</i> Greeks at home will not typically buy small glass bottles of olive oil; the 5-L tin is the typical container. Partly that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s used in cooking, not just to sprinkle on salads or pasta. Especially in Greece and southern Italy, it&#x27;s the main cooking fat, since butter, lard, canola oil, sunflower-seed oil, etc. are not widely used. But Italians realized that selling smaller bottles to the boutique export market was a good business, while Greeks only realized later that there was this market for premium-priced oil in a 500-mL bottle, aimed at people who use it for smaller-volume things (i.e. not for cooking imam baildi or French fries).<p>It does last a long time, though, so if you want a good deal, find your local Mediterranean market and pick up a tin, then transfer portions to a more convenient bottle with a funnel. Kept in a cool, dark place, you should get several years of shelf life.<p>edit: Everywhere I said 5-L above, substitute 3-L. Misremembered the size. The tins are rectangular and look like this: <a href=""http://www.thegoodfoodnetwork.com/shop/images/26713/Iliada-pdo-kalamata-extra-virgin-olive-oil.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thegoodfoodnetwork.com/shop/images/26713/Iliada-p...</a>",1375740148

To be fair I haven&#x27;t dug in that much to the tech community here, but I&#x27;ve checked it out a bit.<p>Developers in Toronto are very cheap compared to large cities in the US like NYC and SF. A lot of really good Canadian developers move to the US because they get paid 2-3x as much.<p>There is very little &quot;startup tech culture&quot; in Toronto itself which is good or bad depending on what you want. That being said Kitchener/Waterloo, although very small, is actually closest feeling I&#x27;ve seen to SV with regards to engineering focus and community. It&#x27;s about 2 hours outside of Toronto.<p>Most early stage startup investing in Canada is done by BDC (or Business Development Canada). Even with incubators like Extreme Ventures, the company she is working at in the article did Extreme, the majority of the money they invest is from the government of Canada. Canadian founders I know who have taken Canadian money always say that you are better off taking money from investors in the US.<p>Canadians, in general, are more risk averse. Even Americans who wouldn&#x27;t start a company understand what entrepreneurship is about as it is kind of baked into the American raison-d&#x27;etre -- but this is not the case in Canada.",1375740063

Here's a mirror: s3.amazonaws.com/2008/nba_paper.pdf<p>In short, an NBA coach who has never been an NBA player will tend to have a worse W-L record than a coach who has played in the NBA. And NBA allstars who become coaches have the best coaching records. From the paper: ""For the typical team, the difference between having a coach who never played NBA basketball, and one who himself played many years of allstar basketball, is approximately six extra places up the league table.""<p>Which is interesting, but yes, let's be careful when drawing conclusions and generalizations. To that end the paper said ""our findings may be relevant to a range of high-performance workplaces where the employees are experts."" The researchers merely found some data that suggested a coach's past performance as a player was positively correlated to his W-L record as a head coach. The paper did not conclude that interpersonal skills were irrelevant to a coach's record, nor did it conclude that interpersonal skills mattered less than playing skills. The researchers did not interview any people or even define terms like leadership, interpersonal skills or expert knowledge. They did milk 8 seasons' worth of Sporting News though, their primary source.",1221424815

I have 4 systems within a short range of my home system, each has every planet maxed out and every colony maxed out. Which means I get 30 items of spice very quickly. When I stopped playing(after 2 days) I had a grand total of 90 million.<p>Terraforming? I have the maxed out cargo bay and have 50 items of each stage for terraforming. If I run out, I can go to any of my planets and just shoot the beam around getting only those that I like<p>Battle? I have 5 sidekicks, they are useless though since my ship has something like 11000 health, has the shield option that makes it invincible for a few minutes and has maxed out weaponry. Meaning I can take out another home planet(8 colonies) w/o needing to recharge/heal...takes like 30 seconds to hover over a colony, shoot up the main ring of buildings, and then have them surrender with 3 shots at the town hall.<p>Customization? Sure its fun at first, but it gets boring fast, by the end of it I just went to the database and pulled out old designs.<p>Alliances? Also boring, I'm down to only needing to do one mission to get a full fledged alliance and there is only like 3 variations there.<p>Looking back I'd say I spent more time designing the creatures, buildings and units than I did playing the actual game. i.e. I spent more time designing the town hall in the world stage, than I did actually playing it.",1221424068
304004,comment,303572,303891,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Charles Moore himself said, ""…FORTH is an amplifier. A good programmer can do a fantastic job with FORTH; a bad programmer can do a disastrous one.""<p>From my own experiments with it, I can certainly see where he's coming from - badly factored Forth rapidly collapses into an unintelligible mess, but when you work idiomatically with the language, it can be quite expressive. It's pretty low level, but worth considering in a project that would otherwise use assembler. I'd be wary of using it unless several team members were already familiar with it, though.<p>I haven't done a great deal with Forth day-to-day because it's a pretty bad mismatch for the problem domains I usually work in, but getting into the mindset of it was as enlightening as learning, say, Scheme or ML. Forth has strong incentives for partitioning your code into functions (""words"") that are each succinct enough to be trivially testable / verifiable, and then lets you define new words via composition, building up to your problem. It heavily favors the same bottom-up / ""build your own DSL"" programming style as Lisp. For such a minimalistic language it has several impressive tricks up its sleeve, on par with Lisp's code-is-data. The ease in parsing Forth-like code gives it a lot of potential as an embedded language, e.g. Zed Shaw's ""stackish"" (<a href=""http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/stackish.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/stackish.html</a>).<p>This heavily-documented i386-assembly code implementing a simple, non-optimizing Forth interpreter is worth a look. (<a href=""http://www.annexia.org/_file/jonesforth.s.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annexia.org/_file/jonesforth.s.txt</a>) There's something to be said for a language environment you can easily understand all the way down to the bare metal. It's not difficult to write your own interpreter for a Forth-like language (which is kind of the point).",1221423922

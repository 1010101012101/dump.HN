I am just suffering from a case of google fatigue and am tired of hearing/reading about that company.<p>You are right, as an outsider it probably would be good to read about eboys.  I just think that the VCs during that era don't deserve much veneration or ink because they just seemed to pump money into almost any half-baked idea.<p>I have been sort of schizophrenic in my reading habits lately, trying to make it through ""The Road To Reality"" (Penrose), Foundation (Rand), and Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (Cassirer).   I also intend to read most of the books on the list you posted.",1186894635

At first I thought ""Okay, home page source code leaked.  So what?  It's a little ugly, but whatever""..  Now I'm not so sure.  Everyone's taking this and running with it. Maybe this just happens when you're the underdog.<p>I guess my real question is, who cares, and why?  Not antagonistic, just honestly curious.",1186894633

How did I ever use public transit without it? If even the government can compete in this area, a small startup could wipe the floor with both of them.",1186894529

41615,comment,41595,41595,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Google _does_ have competitors with deep pockets. The post mentions being nimble. You don't necessarily have to be more nimble than google -- just the competitors in the market that would do better to buy you than build their own.<p>But M&A frenzy shouldn't gloss over the need for a way to monetize a product. If you're building a good user base, and have a way to make money, you're in good shape no matter what Google does...<p>... maybe.",1186892446

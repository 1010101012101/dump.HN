4527578,comment,4526593,4526593,1,0,clebio,,,"The part about needing better development support, debugging tools and such, for mobile browsers seems valid. I'm not familiar enough with that to really say, but I've felt similar things from my limited use of Chrome developer tools (in comparison to native linux options, or OS X's Instruments, etc.).<p>Having worked in telecom engineering for the past several years, I do think the network constraints are real. There are already several comments on this thread regarding limited resources, though more around the mobile device capabilities compared to desktops.<p>From a network perspective, for the mobile carriers, though, high-bandwidth streaming content and chatty apps are a big deal. The 'data explosion' (that we're just approaching the initial inflection point now) is essentially why most carriers are metered plans. Users want lots of content and the options for high-def streaming are only going to grow. Chatty, social, location-based services (aka SoLoMo) cause a lot of connections (since cellular radios kill battery, connections are torn down quickly).<p>The resource constraints now aren't the same as they were in the days of campus mainframes, or even the now waning days of fat-client PC desktops and laptops. But low-powered mobiles, running thin client apps over mobile networks, clearly have several constrained dimensions. Some of those won't change quickly. And there's some data to show that the slice of users whose _only_ internet access is over their mobile device is growing.",1347749856

If I had a good lawyer, I could drum up something to sue almost any company for, patent-related or otherwise. I probably wouldn't win, but I'd force them to spend a lot of money defending themselves. If anything that's more an indictment of the broader legal system than patents.<p>Regardless this is more of a software patent issue (an area of patent law I don't think anyone would argue is working) than one relating to game mechanics. The patents in both cases could easily be applied to non-game software. To my knowledge, nothing like this happens in non-software gaming.",1347749835

My comment has to do with mixing legal principles (or more specifcally, areas of law) that are very different and do not mix well.<p>I disagree that ""the same legal principle"" applies, but then I'm not sure we have the same principles in mind.  It sounds like you are thinking about the concept of conspiracy in general, or contributory infringement.  But that's not what I was referring to.<p>In my mind, there is a clear delineation between what is criminal offence and involves bodily harm (""illegal"") and what is simply an alleged violation of intellectual property or contractual rights (e.g. ""alleged copyright infringment"").<p>When someone jumps from one to the other, as the commenter did, it is very strange.  Because to me they are two very different areas of law with their own distinct philosophical origins.

Stories that appeal to emotion and stories that relate to data.<p>From my experience in newsrooms, stories that are primarily emotional are dealt with by Journalists nearly exclusively, they require strong story telling and usually invasive interviewing and exposure.<p>Stories from data tend to be collected by outside interests and presented to newspapers. Journalists can then spin stories from the data, or if they are writing for a financial publication typically highlight the most salient points for consumption. Occasionally, and far more infrequently than in the past, the media institution will collect a survey themselves or crunch the numbers, and this is almost always pseudo-scientific.<p>Ultimately journalists rarely improve this data other than to make it more gossip worthy. There is a huge amount of data presented every day, from pr firms, from foundations and from public bodies, and all of it wants to be read.<p>Warren Buffet might prefer to read it in the New York Times, but with a strong and deep twitter feed almost anyone can now be as informed as the average news room (there are exceptions to this, on the other hand, reading those same newspapers cover to cover is also a good way to fill your head with soporific twaddle)<p>While I don't agree with the original article, as I think many publications offer some well reasoned analysis and challenging opinions, social media is more than enough to stay as well informed as anyone, though it remains more difficult to navigate.<p>On the other hand, imagine if Warren Buffet were only allowed to get his information from cable news.

That is the direct a to b comparison I had hoped for.<p>These images are no less impressive without a color balance provided by the editor.  They are a journey through the former Russian empire and down the old Silk Road into a past made more accessible by color.  Beyond any concerns of the trueness of their rendition, they are a readily comprehended document of a world long gone.

This is a far-flung agrarian empire and the ancestors of an antique world on the cusp of an upheaval.<p>Whatever the realities of the world represented and the facts that fill in my poor command of history, this is a world that integrates itself squarely with our everyday world precisely because it is depicted in a familiar fashion.

The silicon division doesn't particularly care about the phone division - they care about their bottom line alone. And Apple turning up with a dump truck of cash, which is basically what they've been doing to secure component supplies, is not something they wil turn down lightly.<p>Apple is somewhat unique among consumer electronics companies in that it is very singly focused. Samsung, along with Sony, Microsoft, and others, are multi-conglomerates, with vast reaching business interests, and Samsung's chip fab division only really cares about the profits their division is making. Money from Apple, money from an internal cross-charge: profit is profit.<p>> ""3. ARM aren't really a supplier to apple, they just licence designs. ARM have no manufacturing expertise.""<p>I don't think this is what you mean. You mean ARM have no expertise manufacturing <i>at scale</i>. ARM have extensive manufacturing expertise, because they need to supply reference designs <i>that work in production</i>. ARM has manufacturing expertise because they need to produce designs that are easy to manufacture.",1347746960

Most of the advice in the book did not pertain to me, but one tidbit of knowledge that I gain is that you can save time by simply ignoring the news. Most of us are not in the position to change anything, and much of the news does not pertain directly to us.

Did you catch that part?<p>I'm simply pointing out that for some people the news is very valuable to what they do.  As you say, for the OP it might not have as much value.  It depends on what you're trying to do.<p>I think a more interesting title would be: ""The power of being able to think for yourself"".  For example, it's possible to be able to read the news, when it is overwhelmingly negative or even low quality news (e.g. it doesn't tell you anything you don't already know), and still derive something positive from it.  And there are many examples that prove this: businesspeople who read heaps of news and still manage to accomplish quite a lot, at least in the opinion of their peers.<p>You may stop reading the news.  But most everyone else is still reading it.  And to the extent your business is concerned with some segment of that group I refer to as ""everyone else"", the news is a factor to consider.<p>Hope that's a little more clear.<p>pg's essay on PR as it relates to startups is a decent intro into how the news can be important for hackers.",1347746951

Here in Chicago we have the El and the Metra, which were built a hundred years or so ago. The El runs through the city mostly on elevated tracks above the existing roadways. The elevated tracks are supported by simple steel frameworks above the roadway. There's not a lot of room for stations, so they are simple platforms hovering over the intersections with stairs leading up to them. The floors are wood plank and there are some metal railings. The Metra is similarly simple. Metra tracks run on embankments across the city. They're simple dirt embankments with a retaining wall. Simple metal bridges cross the roadways, without a huge amount of clearance. The stations are mostly just wood and metal platforms with wooden railings, with wooden stairs leading up from street level. This all works really well--Metra is the busiest commuter rail system outside of NYC, shuttling 300,000 people into the downtown core every day.<p>Now, compare this to the new Silver line in DC. It's monstrously over-engineered, even though it runs on a dedicated right of way. Instead of running the train on a simple embankment in the middle of the road or on a simple raised platform, it runs on a huge elevated concrete platform:  <a href=""http://transportationnation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/07.03.12news-cooper-silver-line-edit.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transportationnation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/0...</a><p>And this is in a low-density suburban area!<p>Compare this to the El: <a href=""http://marcel-marchon.com/img--117945132--Chicago-El-train--m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marcel-marchon.com/img--117945132--Chicago-El-train--...</a><p>Transit does not need to cost a billion dollars per mile.

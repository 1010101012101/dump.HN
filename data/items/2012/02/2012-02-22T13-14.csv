There is a Google logo that I can't click on and there's a Gmail link underneath it, but clicking the Gmail link opens a popup menu. I have to then click ""Gmail"" on the popup menu to get to my Inbox.

I'd bet more people will have noticed this change in behavior than those who've noticed the change from a Gmail logo to a Google logo.<p>My point is, all this requires me to think.

My idea is meant to be another alternative - for people who haven't.  Also, there is nothing wrong with being on multiple types of platforms if you're serious about finding someone - most people are.<p>In response to a few of your points:\n1) It is very hard to fake a Facebook account.  It's hard to get those 1000 friends and tacky drunk pictures from college.\n2) OKCupid already does qualitative filtering ad nauseum - the efficacy is debatable but for someone who wants more objective filtering that they can understand and doesn't take a long time to implement, Circl.es could be better.\n3) Rejection is part of the game, but it can be reduced by making sure that you're only considering people with whom you have a shot - allowing people to say ""no"" before you even see them, filtering both ways, and forcing people to make simple choices early on can reduce the pain.<p>To be honest, my biggest beef with OkCupid is the complexity.  A new user coming the site can barely understand how it works - it takes time and a lot of work to use the system.  The other day I had a friend join and I just typed okcupid.com/profile/his_name into my browser and pulled up his profile (I'm not a member of the site).  He was horrified! I know they have privacy settings, but it takes time for new users to ""get"" this.  Furthermore, I have personal doubts about whether personality matching really works - I think the depths of the human psyche might be a bit beyond computing.... but that's just my opinion.<p>Ultimately, OKCupid is a very cool site - many people love it.  My site is different and, if it is successful, will have a different set of strengths in terms of matching people.  If you weren't married I'd encourage you to at least Circl.es a trial run to see how different it is!",1329917704

ICS has implemented the ""swipe away"" feature and that feature has been around for a long damn time in the Android universe.<p>7. Depending on the phone you get, this differs. Unless, of course, you install an app that does it for any version of Android. Like Quick Settings or the pain version: Quicker.

You're talking about developers spending time on implementing backup, which is wrong. That's not what developers should be doing. Sysadmins may occasionally write software to solve a problem, but they're not software developers. Software developers may occasionally do sysadmin type work, but in my experience most of them are notoriously bad it it (setting up mod_python because they have a blog post with step-by-step instructions from 2004 bookmarked where that was the best way to do stuff - or leaving gigantic virtualenv turds with complete python binaries in your SCM because they don't understand what virtualenv is for).<p>Sysadmins also have toolkits (you know, screwdrivers, torx bits, zip-ties) and have scars on their arms that prove they aren't afraid of sharp-edged hardware stuff that sometimes starts smoking for no discernible reason and doesn't turn on any blinkenlights when you push the button (many software developers panic at this point). This comes in very handy when you just ""left the cloud"" and you're experiencing first-hand the reasons why people moved into the cloud in the first place (hardware sucks).<p>Sysadmins also know about this backup stuff and will tell you to shut up when you start talking about doing it with cobbled together shell scripts. They'll probably recommend using something like Amanda (or a commercial equivalent), that makes sure your backups happen regularly, are complete and actually contain the stuff you needed to backup. Good ones may even know to test the backup occasionally by restoring a server just to see if it actually works afterwards.<p>(Apologies to any software developers who know their sysadmin stuff.)",1329915964

343603,comment,343551,343551,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I wonder if the ""upper brain"" segment, so pronounced in mammals could be associated with the ""meme machine"" of Susan Blackmore, et al. In other words, I wonder if whereas genetic evolutionary pressures were responsible for the lower and mid sections of the brain, it would be interesting to explore if ""memetic"" evolutionary pressures were largely involved in the development of the upper brain. A related point I find interesting is inherited hard-wired behavior. I read somewhere that infants might have a 'facial recognition template' that enables them to recognize the female humanoid face, e.g. the mother, and this template is 'pre-progammed' into their brain, without having to be learned. If so, this would represent I think an example of a meme. The female humanoid face could be a meme in some sense, which is hard-wired into the ""upper brain"" segment of the infant. Just as the mid and lower sections of the brain are focused on the promulgation of the ""Selfish gene"", perhaps the sole purpose for the existence of the upper brain is the promulgation of the ""selfish meme"", i.e. the upper brain is the ""meme machine"", and consciousness (and ourselves in the sense of 'self' for that matter) is sort of an accidental by-product of the meme machine - it is better for the meme for there to be 'itentionality' about its replication, 'intentionality' is found in consciousness, ergo, we have consciousness. Anyway cool article, and I like the intro video explaining embryonic brain development in the humanoid.",1224949566

You couldn't previously as it was too demanding. I can leave many browser windows open because the overhead of many windows of interpreted javascript is minimal. You can use expose and similar as if they were free because the OS can offload to a beefy video processor.

343591,comment,343435,343506,0,0,mixmax,,,"OK, here is the explanation. Maybe it isn't as obvious as I thought.<p>Let's say that you invest in 100 random stocks in 1978 and intend to keep them as a long term investment. In 2008 when you want to sell your stock it has on average risen by x%. But some of the companies you invested in have gone bankrupt, and thus these shares are worth nothing. This pulls your entire portfolio down by quite a bit.<p>Now if you look back from 2008 instead of looking forward from 1978 you will see a different picture. If you pick 100 random stocks and see what their stockprice was in 1978 (which is what this guy seems to have done)  you might expect to get the same result, but you don't. A lot of companies have gone bankrupt in those 30 years, and you don't include these in your back-looking portfolio. Yet, as we see these days, it is a real scenario that the company you have invested in will simply tank and your shares will be worth nothing. Over thirty years my guess is that 3 out of 100 companies will go bankrupt, meaning that bankruptcies alone diminishes your portfolios value by 3%.<p>I think this is quite substabtial.",1224948149

343589,comment,342374,342695,0,0,etal,,,"Yep, my school recently started teaching Python as the intro programming language -- for the bioinformatics program, at least.<p>C, C++ and Fortran have similar enough characteristics and capabilities for scientific work that once a researcher has learned one, there's not much benefit to learning either of the others. But scripting/glue languages make it possible to hack together something in an afternoon that's impressive enough to get another scientist's attention and perhaps consider that languages do matter.<p>I think Python will convince new scientists that C++ and Fortran deserve to be replaced, and another fast, easy-to-parallelize language will be the actual replacement.",1224948036

343587,comment,343062,343062,0,0,tdonia,,,"+1 savrajsingh<p>what's the difference between a social network and a social utility?  and what's the difference between a social network and a community?  in many ways, they're different words for the same things - but there are gradations that i've noticed:<p>i'll start with what i know - communities form from commonalities, through the shared assumptions & interests that connect people.  HN works because we all feel that there are like-minded people here that will appreciate our ideas on hacking (or take an interest in arguing with them).<p>social networking is a bit more ambiguous as it's a newer term, but i'll venture that most people use it to mean a collection of connectible communities.  social networks are a community of communities, making a more basic assumption/interest commonality that allows for a much wider/diffuse audience.  myspace connects those that feel it provides a creative conduit for representing their personality, whatever that personality cares about.<p>social utility is even newer & is the carrot facebook is dangling for its investors.  a social utility, by my understanding, is a meta-social-network.  that is, almost purely a boring infrastructure play that could be successful even if it becomes invisible.  it's a set of components/tools, sort of like ning, that allow people to create their own social networks - and by extension, communities - on the fly.  that said, they aren't invisible yet - facebook.com is still what people know as facebook.<p>so how does this connect back to the parent?\nsavrajsingh made an excellent point that the difference between a HN meetup and Hal's facebook meetup was shared interests/assumptions.  an HN meetup operates at a community level, where the participants feel confident that if they attend, they will have something to agree or disagree with.  a facebook meetup (and granted, i can only take this so far as i did not see Hal's original event invite) doesn't necessarily imply that commonality, rather, they leave it up to the event organizer because they intend to support any type of event.  this approach lacks guidelines/constraints for people in Hal's position - someone who wants to make is 700+ friend list more meaningful.  from the article, i can only guess that his invite said ""i'm bored & in toronto - we know each other somehow, so let's play"" - which is a rather generic call to action.<p>my speculation is that he did not offer a lot of his personality in the invite, rather, assuming people would show up & they'd figure out stuff to talk about.  which is fine when you're reaching out to friends who trust you to be interesting, but he wasn't.  that said, there were (hopefully) plenty of commonalities that could be leveraged within his friendset  and were he to pick one shared by enough people also bored, he'd have much more luck the next time.  given that he was in toronto doing this around election time, it seems inviting people out to talk about politics (sports, tv, books, ad infinum) would be one way to create a commonality with his stranger-friends.  the key is finding something to fall back on so when the small talk runs out, the conversation doesn't languish in disconnected/unfamiliar silence.<p>^that last bit is something important to keep in mind when building a product that you're trying to market, too, if you intend for people to talk/form a community around it.  give them a seed to respond to.",1224947745

I'm using them personally, but I don't want to be at shops without some kickass tools and practices already in place. I like my tools, but working at a place without any useful abstractions is no fun.

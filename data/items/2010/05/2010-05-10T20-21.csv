If I'm in the market for miniature porcelain cows ironically dressed as farmers and find them on EBay, what do I care if EBay has 3 other listings or 3 million?<p>I understand that at their current level of maturity the value of EBay and/or Craiglist is partially tied to the size of the marketplace and that focused-and-better may be the best or even only way to compete with them but it seems like on that particular point what works for you, the small emerging marketplace could work just as well for them, they just have a higher overhead to meet.

Three years ago (when my first Rails book came out), covering deployment in the first chapter would have been unthinkable, but with Heroku the unthinkable becomes<p><pre><code>  $ git init && git add . && git commit -m ""init""
  $ heroku create
  $ git push heroku master
</code></pre>
Subsequent deploys go like this:<p><pre><code>  $ git commit -am ""Changed some stuff""
  $ git push heroku

This means that almost every year, local budgets are shrinking relative to inflation.<p>Doesn't MA reassess on transfer?  CA does, so property tax revenues grow faster than the cap.<p>Note that CA also does ""catchup"" - the bill goes up by the cap whenever the difference between the assessed and real value is greater than the cap, no matter what's happened to the real value.  That's why property tax bill is going up this by the cap year even though the value of my house took a 30% hit last year.  It's the same for anyone who has owned for more than 5 years.<p>Note that housing inflation has been more than other inflation, so trailing housing inflation doesn't imply that the local govt is losing ground.<p>> ""Screw those councilmen, they want to raise our taxes so they're holding these services hostage.""<p>Since that's how govts actually behave....<p>Look at what they do and don't threaten to cut and ask yourself if those are rational priorities.

When you read a good summary of a book coupled with insightful comments, you may gain better balanced perspectives than reading the whole book itself (which in a lot of cases just present one-sided arguments). Moreover, you might have spent only 1/10 of the time and will likely have a pretty good idea whether it's worth spending more time to read it in full.<p>A nice example is the Wikipedia article on the book 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' which presents an outline of its theory together with criticism and responses--the latter two cannot be found in the book itself. I read the whole 480-page book a few years ago and I currently remember less than the outline given in that single article. Yes, it was a fairly enjoyable reading experience, but comparing to all other opportunities and hobbies I could be doing, I would have saved the time by reading the Wikipedia article and other summaries & critics instead. Another book I regret reading in full is the 320-page 'Blink' which is well-summarized in a single article: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_%28book%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_%28book%29</a>.<p>To actually learn rather than having fun with prose and anecdotes, in the amount of time reading one book in full, you can instead explore a summary of ten books in interconnected areas and develop a more complete model of the field. If you pick good summaries and well-cited books (so that we can delve into conclusions without arguing too much about raw data), you can learn a whole lot more and in a more balanced way in the same amount of time.

1335800,comment,1334759,1334759,0,0,WiseWeasel,,,"Now that Android has somewhat matured and HP is dumping massive resources into WebOS, it may be time for Apple to think about winning hearts and minds again, doing things like allowing iPhone users to install the apps they want to install, including those which carriers and other partners may not be particularly fond of, as Android and WebOS users are able to do.<p>Of course the yearly iPhone release cycle is a big factor, and it can be expected that the product will do relatively poorly at the end of its cycle, but that's also what makes the iPhone so incredibly profitable for Apple. A possible solution to this may be for Apple to have two radically different iPhone models serving different markets, and have the release cycles staggered by six months. Another alternative would be to release a new model every eight months instead of twelve, take a hit in profitability, and still be able to line up with people's two-year plan refreshes, now every three phone models instead of two. Overall, this problem is somewhat mitigated by the attraction of iPhone OS app availability and the iPhone's brand strength, so it may not be the most important issue to address.<p>The other obvious factor is the exclusive carrier agreement with AT&T in the US, with Verizon pouring marketing money into Android to counter Apple's iPhone. Apple is leaving the door wide open for competitors to establish themselves with people who prefer other carriers for various reasons, giving a great boost to Android device vendors. Ending this exclusive distribution agreement as soon as possible seems like the most obvious answer to this competitive pressure.<p>Personally, I recommend people get Android phones because I'm fearful of the power Apple wields over its users (namely me, making me jailbreak my iPhone to run valuable applications that Apple won't allow for whatever reason), and I need credible competition to keep that power in check. I think many technophiles are rooting for and promoting competitors, even if they use iPhones themselves, simply due to Apple's repression of user empowerment with iPhone OS devices. I honestly believe that loosening the reins on their iPhone OS users would afford Apple a whole lot more goodwill with geeks, and remove many of the reservations they have recommending iPhones to people. Making the iPhone more geek-friendly should obviously not be done at the expense of usability for the less geeky, but the value of courting this class of users is to be ignored at Apple's peril, as they are the ones many people trust to guide their purchasing decisions.<p>So that seems about the extent of what Apple can do to turn their fortunes around. It will be interesting to see how this marketshare trend holds in the next year in relation to the iPhone release cycle, ruling out the effect of the end of the current iPhone model's life, compounded by the Gizmodo iPhone 4G leak. There are other obvious areas of improvement in the iPhone OS I'm sure they're working on, such as a workable documents and basic filesystem functionality, but the PR problem surrounding the issue of vendor control over users seems like the critical one for the iPhone at this point. That said, I don't want to take away from this momentous day for Android users, developers and stakeholders.<p>This is a huge milestone for the Android platform, and a watershed moment for mobile app developers. You can bet this is music to the ears of Android devs looking for investment, and that Android will be getting a lot better software for it. It's good to see Apple get a taste of humble pie; they've always done their best work as underdogs, when the pressure is on. Personally, if Apple stays their current course another year, I would expect this trend to be irreversible.<p>Disclosure: I own some AAPL and PALM shares. Sorry for the essay!",1273522749

It's difficult to make you value that until you've tried it.<p>Vim will increase your productivity by allowing you to manipulate large or small pieces of text at will, in ways you've probably not thought of, while your hands rarely leave their position of hovering over the home row. The arrow keys work, but you'll rarely use them. You'll be fast, not from fast typing but from <i>less</i> typing.<p>Once you've become reasonably proficient with vim, the difference between arrow key-based editors and vim begins to feel like the difference between chisels on stone and telekinesis.<p>It's easy to become minimally proficient. After you've installed gvim, run it and run these two commands:<p>[ESC]:help<p>[ESC]:help tutor<p>You should know about the first command, but the second is more important for you right now. It shows you how to start the interactive vim tutorial on your system, which will teach you just enough to use vim better than you can use Notepad++. Follow the tutorial, it won't take long and you don't have to do it all at once.<p>Now use vim whenever you edit a text file. You'll be a little slower than Notepad at first (but not much). You'll quickly gain speed.<p>The vim screencasts mentioned elsewhere in the comments are good for people learning vim, but I don't think they're a great advertisement for vim. The best thing for you is to run the tutorial.<p>Note: everything said here goes for emacs as well. It's a personal choice, and most people are either a vim person or an emacs person. I've never liked the chord-like commands of emacs, but emacs has more integration with the world outside of text editing and compiling than vim. Whichever type of person you turn out to be, you should be using one of these instead of Notepad.<p>Note note: I like vim so much that I've installed a firefox addon that lets me quickly edit web page text fields (like this one) with vim. <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125</a>",1273522641

But I'll share an experience of mine.<p>I lived in the 79th precinct, adjacent to the 81st. It's less dangerous, but not much -- still Bed Stuy and very block by block. I was there for about 6 months in late 2007.<p>The area is tense at times -- much of New York's prosperity over the last two decades hasn't trickled down to the people living there aside from landlords selling their buildings to gentrifies or speculators. There was an incident around this time where an unstable young man was shot because he had a comb the police mistook for a weapon in the dark. I wouldn't have been surprised if it had escalated into riots. Gentrification is welcome by some, protested by some, and many are indifferent to it, I think. There are very few nice places to eat or socialize or even get groceries, but there are a ton of bodegas and fried chicken/pizza places and dollar stores. It can be a very rough place, which is too bad as I got to know some very nice people on my block.<p>Certainly there are institutional problems in the NYPD, but also I have the suspicion that many rookie cops eventually get rotated into areas like this -- Bushwick, Bed Stuy, East New York and this contributes to much of the stuff you will learn about in these tapes. The penis jokes, the confusion on what to report and not gracefully handling tension within the communities -- I wonder if it is inexperience.<p>Comparisons to The Wire are natural, but in the time I lived in Bed Stuy, the only similarity I really observed was that the NYPD guys never seemed to interact with the people of the neighborhood as if they too were part of that community. Never said hi while walking their beats, never stopped to talk to the kids or the corner boys, they mostly walked in twos or threes, chatting with each other. I think for the people that live there and the cops that work there, there is us and them and not much in between.",1273522576

1335783,comment,1335462,1335462,0,0,bediger,,,"Probably just a few things contribute to most of the ""productivity"" you can get from vim:<p>1. Commands to move around the screen and file under edit: with at most 2 keystrokes you can (a) move to next word (b) move to previous word (c) move to start of line (d) move to end of line (e) move to start of file (f) move to end of file (g) move 1 character in any direction (h) move to the end of next word (i) move to end of previous word (j) move to the next word like the one under the cursor (k) move to the previous word like the one under the cursor.  Other commands exist to make moving around really efficient: you rarely take your hands off the keyboard to do mousing.<p>2. Use of regular expressions for searching for text, and as a way of distinguishing edits.  You can do things like change all tabs to 4 spaces with a single command, or change the tabs at the beginning of the line to 4 spaces. This is an astoundingly powerful idea, rarely exploited however.<p>3. Vim, improving on vi, has the ""visual"" modes, where you can use movement keys (see item 1) to choose a hunk of a file, then apply edits or change commands to that block.<p>4. Vim isn't really modal like all the propaganda has you believe.  Sure, 'i' or 'a' or 'I' or 'O' will put you in what you can naively interpret as ""literal typing mode"". But you should really think of those as commands, followed by text, as you can do 5Ax<esc> and append 5 'x' characters to the end of the line.  If you think about what most people call ""modes"" correctly, you can pull off a lot of interesting and fast edits.<p>5.

If you want to open one, just put the mouse over it and lift.<p>Something that didn't get much press but which is unique and wonderful to use is the integration between the filesystem and the UI. Email messages are just files that sit in a directory, but the tracker exposes attributes to them, and you can have it display columns for 'From' and 'Subject'. Your inbox is just a folder that contains your mail messages. There's an instant message client that works along  these lines too. Users are just files, and the IM functionality is a plugin engine to the tracker. This feels connected to the 'everything is a file' philosophy.<p>The OSX filesystem is technically capable of some of this stuff (written by the same guy, and later, so it's probably a lot better), but the finder isn't. So even though OSX is probably superior internally, in practice it isn't better to use.<p>There's a library called bethon that exposes the internals of the OS to python. I've used this with success in the past, not recently. It used to be the case that you could use a combination of the C++ BeBook dev but then piece stuff together from the python console.<p>Update: Got bethon working.

If you search for tvbydemand malware, it gets you to that guys site where he reposts press releases about OTHER malware. Shady as hell.

If you can provide an offering that makes more fiscal sense to consumers or small business people, you may find fertile fields.  I can just hear them now, ""I hated paying those $<i>#</i>@^!

55427,comment,55196,55419,0,0,rms,,,"I went to public high school in a Western Pennsylvania suburb (two PA Turnpike stops away from Paul Graham's alma mater, which means our suburban strip wasn't quite as good) and in my best social studies class (US History) we watched an unreasonable amount of full length movies, including Band of Brothers in its entirety. We didn't do a whole lot in the class, but at least he told us that Westerners killed all of the Indians. He told us to just read Howard Zinn if we wanted to learn something.",1189984556

If they agreed with him, they shouldn't have been in that meeting in the first place.  If they disagreed with him, they should have stood up in the middle of his rant and told him to stop talking and leave the room.<p>As it happened, I guess it was uncomfortable for them to discuss, so this scene, which is just about the worst-case scenario, came to pass.",1189983834

So current soft sciences plod about trying to gather some type of predictablity in their theories, but often falling back to trying to make causal statements of their experimental observations.<p>I think there's been attempts before, like cybernetics, that tries to model human behavior using signal processing techniques.  To my understanding, it's since fallen out of favor.  So while it's been tried before--and I don't know for sure, but my gut says that there probably is mathematics, other than statistics, to bring more analysis into the social sciences.<p>Otherwise, the math just hasn't been invented yet.  Currently there are studies in nonlinear systems, complex systems, and math of intervation and manipulation.  My shallowly informed guess is that one of these will help out.<p>Or else we just have to wait for a Physicist to help us out here.<p>",1189983604

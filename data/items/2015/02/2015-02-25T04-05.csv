9105367,comment,9104461,9104461,0,0,lscore720,,,"Good advice here so far.  I&#x27;ll add a few nuggets from my experience helping tons engineers prep:<p>1. Some people just freeze up in interviews.  It&#x27;s anxiety-inducing, especially coding interviews; you&#x27;re not alone.  Here&#x27;s a bolder approach that often works: reach out to interviewer, hiring manager, even HR beforehand, and give them the heads up that: you know in advance, you&#x27;re not a natural interviewer, but have learned that you&#x27;re still capable and interview nerves don&#x27;t mean incompetence on the job.  They&#x27;ll appreciate the honesty, you&#x27;ll have set the expectation beforehand (preventing disappointment), and I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if you run into interviewers who can sympathize, may respect you for being vocal, self-aware & upfront.<p>2.  Same theme as above (going above & beyond as communicator during process), but during the interview.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask questions or for clarification, and keep it light by saying something like &quot;sorry, I just get the jitters with interviews.&quot;  That can break the awkwardness and maybe just set a nice, new tone, in turn reducing your stress and resulting in a win-win.<p>3. Common sense, but not followed enough for people who struggle in interviews: practice with someone else.  The more you do it, the closer you&#x27;ll get to &quot;being yourself&quot; in the interview.<p>Feel free to let me know if you have Q&#x27;s about this!",1424840050

9105356,comment,9105279,9105279,0,0,informatimago,,,"Now, in the case of programming languages, it is quite understandable, because the target machines (be it called &quot;native&quot; or &quot;virtual&quot;), and intermediate representations are target machines, may lack features and thus render expressing the code of the source language more difficult than it should be.<p>If we take only one example, examine the fundamental difference between two languages like C and Lisp, where it is assumed that the bit patterns in memory representing values are &quot;untyped&quot; in the case of C, but &quot;typed&quot; in the case of lisp.  That is, a given bit pattern can be interpreted in C depending on WHERE it is found:  if found in a variable of type int, it will be interpreted as an integer modulo 2^32; if found in a variable of type double* it will be interpreted as a pointer to a double floating point number.  On the other hand, in lisp,  the bit pattern is &quot;typed&quot;, and it will be interpreted the same, wherever it is copied to.  Unfortunately, unless you have the chance of running a Lisp Machine, you will run your lisp programs on hardware that is designed and optimized for programs written in C, where bit patterns in memory are untyped, and therefore the lisp compilers will have to implement this abstraction adding a layer of interpretation.  Specifically, usually a few bits in each word are reserved to store a type tag, so that one may distinguish words containing pointers from words containing pointers of a certain type, or pointers of another.<p>Now consider LLVM, and consider implementing a language which requires typed data like lisp, and you&#x27;ll realize that LLVM matches the C kind of machines with &quot;untyped&quot; bit patterns more than the lisp kind, and that therefore it won&#x27;t make a good IR for lisp-like languages (python, ruby, javascript, etc).<p>This is not to say that it&#x27;s impossible to target LLVM when writing those language, on the contrary.  But it would be considered as a target language, and evaluated as such, and not as an intermediate representation on which significant and meaningful (for the lisp programs) optimizations can be performed.",1424839822

You&#x27;ll need more CPU power, but it becomes easier to write, read and maintain your code.<p>I don&#x27;t believe this has to be true in the future (in fact, I&#x27;m not sure I believe it today either). This is a meme that we tell ourselves because we haven&#x27;t invented clever enough programming languages or abstractions yet. This is exactly what I was referring to in my post. We as an industry would have to solve these problems at a fundamental level.<p>Take for instance manual memory management. People used to think that dynamic languages make this so much easier, but it has become <i>much</i> easier to write GC free programs (see C++11 and Rust).<p>I want to see more efforts in this kind of direction.<p>> JavaScript is very efficient in some respects: it trades off speed and memory usage for programmer productivity, safety, security and portability.<p>I take issue with this.

a) We&#x27;ve found that OpenCV&#x27;s boilerplate algorithms have much bigger problems than the ones you have mentioned in deployment scenarios. So, we&#x27;ve had to develop something better from the ground up (while still using the OpenCV infrastructure). 
b) For the tracker to go back to tracking your face, it would require global re-detection which is usually a much slower process.

Thanks for the great comments! 
OpenCV has very rudimentary tracking capabilities. This is why we went back to the drawing board and developed something that is robust in a wide number of cases including in busy environments or where saliency is not high.<p>You are correct about tracking reliability, however, most of our early customers were more worried about creative control and smoothness. So, we&#x27;ve worked hard to make sure they get that level of control while not having to worry about the minutiae of controlling a drone/gimbal.<p>In cases of occlusions or odd situations where it may lose track of the actor, they are more than happy to quickly re-initiate tracking.",1424839317

When users launch their mail app it also launches the script (and mail console applescript) that command line fetches mail, decrypts and inserts into mail.app db, looks through msgs for new public keys and extracts them, updates contacts automatically with GoogleCL and gpgtools, then starts offline mail client to view/reply as they normally would.

It had to be Google contacts it wasn&#x27;t my decision. Nobody wanted to change their mail app workflow and they couldn&#x27;t figure out gpgtools/gpg suite so this poor scheme was devised but it works.<p>The janky part comes when the script checks mail console logs to detect no connection errors when users req to fetch new mail (and suppress popup notifications of this) so they don&#x27;t have to push a second button to do it outside set intervals that fetch automatically. For some reason it was important that no other buttons existed to fetch new mail. There&#x27;s probably a Claws Mail plugin that can be written to accomplish all this too if users were willing to switch apps, mutt will do most of it automatically and can be abstracted to make it invisible, or script OpenSMTPD to do this.",1424839278

But the one in a million chance that he&#x27;ll crack it on the first try exists by necessity.Even titanium breaks under stress.<p>In the pathological case that there&#x27;s <i>zero</i> possibility (not even epsilon), the whole business of encryption is rendered moot because the rightful user himself cannot access the data!

I actually saw this article on Tumblr, I follow the Hacker News bot. This article was ignorant, jumped to conclusions, and not very well informed in general. It quoted a bunch of &quot;experts&quot; who didn&#x27;t seam to understand what tumblr is. They think that by talking about Leehla and Zander we are glorifying them, and therefor suicide, as appose to remembering them for who they wanted to be, and trying to make a safe and excepting environment for trans* kids.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just tired of adults reading one or two things and thinking they know better simply because of seniority. The reporter, the white, middle aged Caitlin Dewey, has a reputation for being facile and provocative. She&#x27;s probably never been on Tumblr. They expert&#x27;s she quotes, while educated, are still probably out of their depth. While some glorifying type blogs do exist (you can&#x27;t generalize tumblr; there are more than 221 million blogs) the majority of blogs about mental illness, feminism, minority rights, etc, are based on trying to educate people and provide them with resources and a safe, understanding place. How about adults stop pointing fingers at the big scary internet and put time and effort into, I don&#x27;t know, making safe spaces for teens so they aren&#x27;t suicidal in the first place? That&#x27;s what people on tumblr are trying to do when they &quot;martyrize&quot; Leehla Alcorn. They&#x27;re putting a face on their movement. Not a movement to glorify suicide. A movement to outlaw trans* conversion therapy, and get proper sex ed in schools. A movement to try and stop teen&#x27;s lives from being a living hell, a movement to stop teens from being pushed to suicide. A movement that many adults can&#x27;t seem to be bothered with--but oh no! The teenagers are obviously trying to get each other to kill themselves because it&#x27;s &quot;cool&quot;.",1424837145

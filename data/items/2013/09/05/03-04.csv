6332067,comment,6306849,6316107,1,0,throwawaykf,,,"Apologies for late reply. Who would I be astroturfing for, exactly?<p>a. Can you make a logical argument <i>why</i> data structures should not be patented, as opposed to, say, mechanical or electronic structures? Try to differentiate them using concrete, technical reasons rather than handwavy &quot;software is math&quot; (aka &quot;mechanisms are just physics&quot; or &quot;electronics are just flowing particles&quot;) arguments.<p>Also, modifications have always been patentable (&quot;a better mousetrap&quot; etc.) The thing is, this patent is not even a straightforward modification; I still have not figured out a solid reason why anyone would use this, a single multiply-ordered linked list, over multiple differently-ordered linked lists.<p>b. That&#x27;s not the &quot;rubber banding&quot; patent you linked, that&#x27;s the &quot;pinch-to-zoom-if-touch-input-is-multi-point-else-scroll&quot; patent. Anyway. You could argue both of those are bogus patents, but you have the benefit of hindsight. Hindsight is a very powerful bias, which is precisely why US (and most other places) require examiners to provide concrete proof, in the form of dated, published documents, of non-novelty or obviousness to deny a claim. This is, as far as I can tell, the only way to truly <i>objectively</i> quantify a claim&#x27;s contribution, and this is why you see the patents you see.<p>Not saying it&#x27;s a perfect system, but once you decide that patents should be a thing, I personally can&#x27;t think of a more objective one.<p>Also, if you think it&#x27;s as easy as &quot;fill out a patent application to get dibs on something&quot;, I strongly encourage you to give it a shot. Assuming a micro-entity status in the US, it should cost you a couple hundred bucks.",1378353526

Borland had Turbo Pascal and Turbo C products on the market for a number of years - vt100 style text menuing systems were still king in MS-DOS.<p>Windows 3.1 was released in 1992, which was the real starting adoption point for the majority of the market.<p>By that time, the NeXT computer had already been out for four years, the Mac and X Windows were eight.<p>I was actually just pointing out that software development, as a discipline hasn&#x27;t advanced that much since 1990.  The number of KLOCs freely available to use within your code has increased dramatically.  The documentation (which was on paper pre-WWW) has improved exponentially.  The tools, OSes and languages?

6332062,comment,6329041,6331954,2,0,btilly,,,"The killer feature that I like for 0MQ is that you can support message passing asynchronously, even when the other side is not currently up.  For instance in a request/response pattern, one side might go away, get restarted, reinitialize, and then they carry on as if there wasn&#x27;t a period in the middle where there was no connection.  This kind of robust handling of network interruptions is very convenient for many use cases.<p>However what you describe isn&#x27;t necessarily going to fit into that.  The #1 thing that your description makes me wonder about is whether RPCs are going to be synchronous or asynchronous.  So, for instance, if you hand me a data structure with a list objects that are references to data that I want to have, and I decide that I need 10 of them, do I have to pay for the overhead of 10 round trips, or can I say, &quot;I need these 10&quot; and get them all at once?",1378353428

One TODO is for the stack (I&#x27;m not sure what there is to do for that). The other is for assignment. This would typically be a reduction step that changes the contents of the heap, but maybe there was still some question about the details of that change (such as whether/when to drop unreachable heap cells).

I believe that this article <i>severely and massively</i> overstates it, though. Effective design <i>hints</i> at the intended message (sometimes, though as you get more iconic this design message becomes more and more abstract), it does not build the brand.<p>Take Whole Foods as an example - the typography, colors, and accents on the logo all refer to a desired corporate identity, but it would IMO be severely overstating the case to say that this is the embodiment of the company&#x27;s brand, as the article seems to be claiming for Yahoo. The logo is but one <i>tiny</i> part of a huge puzzle, the vast majority of which lies firmly in the realm of marketing and branding.<p>Honestly, IMO Yahoo could change their logo to nearly any of the crazy options that they played with, and their brand would not be measurably worse off (or better off). Once you move away from &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burger Palace&quot; with a giant neon burger for a logo, you&#x27;re getting into territory where the perceptual impact of your logo becomes more and more esoteric, hard to measure, and subtle. I sincerely doubt <i>anyone</i> looks at the Yahoo logo and goes &quot;those disjoint serif letter sure sound like a fun and dynamic website!&quot;<p>There are good logos and bad logos, IMO the notion that logo design and measurably influence brand perception (especially when you get into extremely abstract logos like Yahoo, Apple, or even Google) is true, but severely overstated by some designers. It would seem to me that a successful logo is less about messaging and more about its longevity and ability to be iconic.<p>If you took some text and wrote it IBM-style, it would still be visibly IBM. If you took the red-yellow combination and put it on something without the arches, it would still be visibly McDonald&#x27;s. The mermaid figure that represents Starbucks is so out there, and the green so consistently applied to all of its branding, that it can stand alone without the name of the company and still be instantly recognizable. <i>Those</i> factors are IMO far, far more important to a logo than the extremely abstract ideas and values they represent.",1378350401

Test flight is significantly more inconvenient for all parties than sending around Android apks. So is Apple&#x27;s provisioning process for development (you&#x27;ll certainly have to figure out how to re-provision your development devices a few times).<p>Android&#x27;s OS integration also makes for better demos of our app. Since it&#x27;s a remote control for another device it makes a lot of sense to have lock-screen and pull-down controls. We can&#x27;t show that off on iOS.<p>Finally, the Android developers that I know simply don&#x27;t use the simulator, they always use hardware. I found it strange coming from iOS, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. I weight this negative much lower than the deployment advantages that Android has for prototyping.<p>Of course in the end you&#x27;ll have apps on both platforms, but here&#x27;s a vote for doing early development on Android.",1378350240

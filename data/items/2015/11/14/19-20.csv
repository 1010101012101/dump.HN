Trying to focus on what the &quot;domain objects&quot; are and what is their flow is pointless, especially if you&#x27;re dealing with real-world objects (like the fridge from TFA). You can model <i>something</i> this way, but it will be usually the imaginary perfect path, a narrow vision of how things <i>should</i> be done, that will break on first contact with the real world - a world that is messy and requires humans to improvise on the spot.<p>I&#x27;m starting to believe that one should focus on the workflow instead. After all, the reason for writing software as a tool is to simplify or automate some existing process. So focus on what people are already doing and what they&#x27;re trying to achieve and find a way to remove repetitions, unnecessary delays, etc. Just look on what people are doing and find a way to do some parts of the process faster and better.",1447531181

Functionally, these actions should be on opposite sides of the display from each other.  I don&#x27;t even think they placed it there for aesthetic reasons, since the Hide &quot;button&quot; just looks like an ugly hack.<p>Then there&#x27;s positioning of keyboard keys.  If I had a nickel for every time I deleted a character while trying to finish a word with &quot;m&quot;, or every time I accidentally <i>committed</i> an action with incomplete text because of that stupid blue key!  Instead of moving dangerous actions to the <i>opposite end of the screen</i> where they belong, too much effort was spent trying to emulate the precise layout of a real keyboard.  I don&#x27;t think users would complain at all if the &quot;action&quot; key was instead in the top-right corner, and if &quot;backspace&quot; was in the top-left corner.<p>The scrolling calendar widget is also a nasty example of poor positioning.  Long after it was &quot;improved&quot; in iOS 7, I <i>still</i> can&#x27;t create a single calendar event without doing the accidental-screw-up-date-instead-of-scroll action, usually with &quot;helpful&quot; automatic &quot;corrections&quot; for my change such as synchronizing the From and To times to both reflect my accidental date-change.

Snapchat let&#x27;s horny 18 year olds to see nude they may not have otherwise seen. Okay, not super sure how much we need snapchat, but people seem to like it, and that&#x27;s fine. Etc.

The last time there was a security vulnerability in libpng, it took <i>years</i> before it was fixed everywhere.<p>Patching this properly will require not just replacing a centralized copy of libpng, but scanning all binaries for statically-linked copies.

I know that it will be very messy and painful esp in the beginning but as we say here and I paraphrase &quot;Going through pain for an hour is better than having it every hour&quot;<p>Help us to help you.",1447527610

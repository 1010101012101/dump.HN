Although, it isn&#x27;t just that assessments need to rise in tandem with values, which Prop 13 prevents, but the rates on land ought to rise dramatically which Prop 13 also prevents. And taxes ought to be eliminated for improvements.<p>Considering people seem to have planned their lives around the implicit expectation of the current tax structure, it isn&#x27;t ridiculous for seniors on &quot;fixed incomes&quot; to be nervous.<p>But let&#x27;s remember that seniors are the wealthiest age demographic, and those among them who are actually financially needy can be easily cared for while still not stifling all the hopes of young entrepreneurs.",1454101196

Most companies today prioritize the satisfaction of the stakeholders as follows:<p>> C-Level Management->Shareholders->Customers->Employees<p>That&#x27;s not really true.  In the end the shareholders have all the clout.  Management can go against shareholder interests for a time, to the extent they can hide what they&#x27;re doing, but the interests of she shareholders will always be paramount in the end.  I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re expecting.  Yes, management looks after its own interests.<p>But so do employees.  Said nobody ever to himself: &quot;Self, there was a big flood in Thailand this year and the company lost a lot of money, so I&#x27;ll take a lower salary than my skill set demands until the company is back on its feet.  Otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the shareholders.&quot;",1454101194

There is an unspoken agreement that the farm system will train basketball players and when the major league needs them the farm system will get a percentage of the players salary. Now the major league teams are using players that didn&#x27;t go through the farm system, and are only playing garbage time (80% of H-1Bs are paid on the lower 2 tiers of the DOL pay scale).<p>So young people and families see that the farm system isn&#x27;t really all that viable and so they either don&#x27;t participate or chose a different sport all together. Ultimately the farm system dries up...<p>I also skimmed your views, and I&#x27;d like to address the straw man in your moral section. People that are against H-1B aren&#x27;t trying to keep out other people. I&#x27;d prefer that if we do indeed have a shortage which requires special immigration visas that we have actual hard evidence of the shortage first and if the data shows it then to focus on encouraging employers and education institutions to train citizens first. If that can&#x27;t be done, I&#x27;d rather we automatically give citizenship to those that we deem are vital to our economy instead of keeping them in immigration limbo that is the H-1B system.",1454101150

Though many deeply-held political opinions are formulated these days from fiction, religious beliefs are contingent upon faith, a system which prizes, above all else, the continued adherence to what one has been told even in the face of the harshest scrutiny.

The onsite is just to make sure that <i>you</i> wrote the code you submitted, and then to test your non-coding skills (architecture, communication, working with non-engineers, etc).<p>But we <i>do</i> lose some number of candidates who just don&#x27;t get around to doing the homework (or possibly, as you do, refuse to do it).  This worries me, since I suspect the people least willing to do homework will be the most senior and/or those with the most competing offers.<p>We&#x27;ve recently started experimenting with allowing candidates to chose between homework and a code sample.  The idea is that a sufficiently complex and interesting coding sample should tell us about as much as coding homework.  It involves more time on our part to evaluate it, but less for the candidate to prepare it.  The early results have been mixed (a lot of unsuitable coding samples), but we&#x27;re iterating on how we ask for coding samples to try to get better quality ones.",1454099748

I honestly think that&#x27;s as far as it goes for most people.<p>I&#x27;ve felt the exact same pain as you - having the non-technical people work in Excel and moving it back and forth to a database is a nightmare.  I&#x27;ve started creating Flyway migrations for each import/export sequence just so we can keep track of what&#x27;s live in our DB.  If you were working in CSV you could even script an import as part of a build process or something.<p>In some cases better products even exist.  For example LaTeX is a fantastic tool - you can create complex layouts (not just for documents, but also Illustrator-type tasks), automagically manage cross-document references/citations and generate tables-of-content and bibliographies, lay out images and tables and formulas, modularize documents (eg by chapter) and best of all the documents are a plain-text &quot;source&quot; that you can easily check into revision control or merge between multiple simultaneous users.  <i>Zero</i> adoption outside the academic world and certain publishing niches (eg math textbooks).<p>Side note: one unfilled niche I&#x27;ve noticed is that there isn&#x27;t a good word- or character-level diff tool that&#x27;s appropriate for LaTeX.  Ideally you would want to be able to type natural paragraphs and have the diff pick out changes by word instead of line (but preferably also identify command tokens more greedily up to a line).  You can break a paragraph across several lines, but if you&#x27;re making heavy revisions it just ends up being a solid block of line changes.<p>One more question: is there a &quot;worksheet&quot; or &quot;notebook&quot; concept in something like Mathematica that might be a better model for the type of work you&#x27;re considering?  I know Mathematica has a pretty complete feature set, it very well might have database hookups and an appropriate workflow for that type of thing.",1454099635

Whenever data gets updated it&#x27;s really tricky to make sure everything that uses that data reflects the latest state. Too often have I heard the phrase in meetings &quot;Oh that graph? Yeah, that&#x27;s still based on last month&#x27;s data.&quot;<p>2. I&#x27;ve had very smart colleagues who couldn&#x27;t program, but could bend Excel to their will.

I&#x27;m really excited to see that EVE seems to go a long way to solving these things. I can&#x27;t wait to see where they take it next.

The aeronaval would have preferred F16 over rafale ~2000 for exactly this: \n1 rafale = 10 F16 (at the time) and OPEX of rafale >> F16. \nAnd they could have had another diesel carrier thus france could have had a fully usable aeronaval task force for the same price.<p>Anyway: cellular grids where not that developed yet, but efficient distributed radar were.

We did enjoy a brief pre-Slack honeymoon (at Techstars, no less).<p>For a few reasons, we chose Xamarin to build the Kato mobile apps. The end result was pretty good—great, even, considering the ridiculously tight timeline. We had a pretty elaborate common core with all the hard stuff (networking, caching, protocol, presence, etc), and custom UI code for Android and iOS.<p>In the end, since Kato was to be no more, the real benefit was seeing how much sense it makes to use a strongly-typed, object-oriented language for building complex user interfaces.<p>Many years ago, and for many years, we were C#/C++ programmers, so it wasn&#x27;t exactly a revelation. But, we&#x27;d been working for quite some time with dynamically-typed Erlang and dynamically-typed Javascript (the Kato UI was built with Knockout.js).<p>Our server code was fairly straightforward and didn&#x27;t change very much, so Erlang was an excellent choice there. With JavaScript, we&#x27;d programmed our way into some serious debt.<p>When deciding on a stack for Sameroom, we embarked on a quest to replicate the Xamarin experience for the web. We eventually narrowed in on Flux, React, and TypeScript.<p>After some experimentation, we got a development workflow working with gulp, shrinkwrap, make, and no particular IDE (we use Atom, Sublime, and Vim).<p>The biggest crutch was lack of JSX support in TypeScript, so splicing together HTML elements was pretty cumbersome. We viewed this as a temporarly incovenience, which was a good decision—TypeScript 1.6 got React/JSX in September 2015 [2].<p>We&#x27;re pretty conservative about adding dependencies, but the overwhelming majority of libraries we do use have TS support available from the DefinitelyTyped project [3]. The few libraries that weren&#x27;t supported (Stripe checkout and Intercom, if memory serves), we TypeScriptified ourselves.<p>As a result, working on the Sameroom UI is absolute joy.<p>It&#x27;s a little ironic that, unlike Kato, Sameroom basically doesn&#x27;t need a UI, since it&#x27;s just marketing copy and an administrative dashboard.<p>[1] <a href=""https://sameroom.io/blog/from-pivot-to-140-paying-customers-in-ten-months/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sameroom.io/blog/from-pivot-to-140-paying-customers-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/typescript/archive/2015/09/16/announcing-typescript-1-6.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/typescript/archive/2015/09/16/announ...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped</a>",1454098951

I agree that a propulsive landing wouldn&#x27;t be likely any time in the near future.  But if it could eventually be shown to be safe (and therefore the quote above doesn&#x27;t apply), I don&#x27;t necessarily agree that it would be more expensive.  You wouldn&#x27;t need large engines or a lot of fuel, as the capsule wouldn&#x27;t be very heavy.  Yes, it would definitely still be more expensive than parachutes in terms of equipment and weight.  However, it would mean you could land right back at your facility, rather than splashing down in the ocean and dealing with retrieval.  When we&#x27;re looking into the future of reusable, commodity space travel, that would be a significant advantage.",1454098756

My grandmother still grows her own vegetables and still raises chicken.<p>She doesn&#x27;t use fertilizer, but the conditions are quite ideal for a lot of vegetables, including -- yes -- tomatoes.<p>The difference is astounding. Simply slicing one or two tomatoes is enough to make my whole kitchen <i>smell</i> like tomatoes. My palate is so accustomed to supermarket chicken that I literally cannot eat the ones she raises. I have to drown the meat in spices -- the flavour is so strong (and pretty different from that of &quot;mass-produced&quot; chicken) that it makes me vomit. Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have that trouble with her tomatoes.<p>The catch is, indeed, that the yield is fairly low. There&#x27;s no such thing as more than one crop per year, either -- she has tomatoes throughout the summer, but that&#x27;s it. The only exception are cherry tomatoes, which will sometimes grow another generation of fruit in early autumn, and they ripen pretty fast, but that&#x27;s it. Also, the ripening process is fairly slow; by mid-autumn or so, there are still enough unripe tomatoes for her to pickle a few jars.<p>(What, you don&#x27;t pickle tomatoes when they&#x27;re green in the States? You have no idea what you&#x27;re missing!)<p>That being said, their color is pretty uniform. I don&#x27;t have a picture right now, since they&#x27;re out of season, but they really look OK, most of them are no different, in terms of look, from what you can see in supermarkets. Sometimes they grow in a somewhat weird shape (e.g. some of them get rather bulgy, but maybe that&#x27;s a distinct cultivar, I don&#x27;t know; others look perfectly round) but, if you allow them to ripen, they&#x27;re pretty uniformly red. However, at that stage they&#x27;re basically impossible to sell in supermarkets or even at farmers&#x27; markets, they&#x27;ll go bad within days of being picked, even if you refrigerate them. People basically pick them right before a meal (worst case scenario, they&#x27;ll pick a bunch in the morning so that they can chill in the fridge for an hour or two -- summers are pretty hot here, so if you pick them before lunch, you&#x27;ll be eating really warm tomatoes).<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve seen someone here claiming that plain yogurt is <i>supposed</i> to be plain.<p>Fuck no. Plain yogurt is so thick, soury and flavourful that, unless you&#x27;ve grown up with it, it&#x27;s an acquired taste. My grandmother never raised cattle -- I first tasted plain, home-made yogurt at one of her relatives in a remote-ish village when I was 14 or so. I hated it, despite having eaten plain yogurt from the supermarket before, and it took me a whole summer to get accustomed to the taste. It&#x27;s also <i>incredibly</i> filling, you can&#x27;t eat more than a bowl.",1454098307

The second is that the commercial varieties are bred to have a pastier texture and be tougher to stand up to shipping.  The third is that tomatoes don&#x27;t stand up to refrigeration without a change in texture.<p>My uncle grows tomatoes commercially in southeast Tennessee.  If you actually let the commercial varieties ripen all the way and don&#x27;t refridgerate them, they&#x27;re pretty good.  They&#x27;re better than the anything you can buy at a fancy grocery store.  They&#x27;re not as good as homegrown brandywines, but they&#x27;re on par some of the popular hybrid varieties, and will beat out any store-bought heirloom (e.g. a store-bought brandywine).<p>However, when any tomato is picked to sell in bulk, they have to be picked completely green. Otherwise they&#x27;ll be too badly bruised to sell.  The &quot;vine ripened&quot; tomatoes you buy in the store just means that they cut off some of the vine along with the green tomatoes.<p>The site is down, so forgive me if I&#x27;m pointing out something that&#x27;s mentioned there.  At any rate, in my opinion, commercial tomatoes suffer more from being picked completely green so they&#x27;ll survive shipping than anything else.",1454097672

So something that was previously &quot;free&quot; (so as not to be a net neutrality violation) has the same effect of increasing costs and reducing competition.<p>And then on the flip side, if a startup is trying to build a new (possibly better) CDN company, itstill has the same problem.<p>You didn&#x27;t remove the problem, you just moved it, and it&#x27;s still just as unscalable.",1454097631

I thankfully listened to the engineer in me (at that time we had our UI work contracted out and was not shaping up well).\nIt took a while to get a good grip of HTML, CSS and JS. They are the tripod on which today's web UI is balanced. In the end I think it was the right decision to learn it all!<p>Moreover if no core team member knows UI - then either get one or you become one, becoz sooner than later you will repent outsourcing it fully.",1232963914

You think you have discovered something new and hidden and sweet - well, hundreds of people have found it before you, and they have silently failed. That's why you cannot study them.<p>There is only one way to get rich if you are not one of the elite - get off your high horse and get dirty. Start quick, test quickly, poll users and don't charge at first. Evolve, evolve, and evolve. Then get slimy. Studiously ignore techcrunch and focus on the smaller people. All these people who speak about 'buzz', they are part of a social network you are not a part of. They don't tell you this, so you do the same things and you wonder why yours does not work. Observe this eco-system, but do not ever believe you are a part of it, otherwise you will be blocked by their constraints but have none of their advantages.<p>There is no design for making money that works. There is no grand plan, because if there were, someone who have tried it and executed it successfully. There is just having a product, then modeling it in ways that sell it. Then reaching a huge amount of people. Use tricks like network effect, auto spreading, etc. Don't just drop it and expect anything to happen.<p>Most important rule: Don't let the constraints that tie the minds here tie you down.",1232963741

450197,comment,450148,450176,0,0,pj,,,"I think people are wising up. We are beginning to demand truth in advertising. When we are lied to, we are walking away. When we had lots of money, we would tolerate it, but not anymore. In times of surplus, we can act without reason, but in times of scarcity, rationality wins.<p>It was funny walking around the store -- like a bad garage sale.  People would pick things up, look at them with this confused look on their face like they were thinking, ""Are these people serious?"" and then put it down and walk away.<p>People don't have any money.  Where is the mystery? People want bargains and Circuit City has 1.3 BILLION dollars worth of inventory they have to move.<p>Marking up 20% then down 10% isn't going to move product. That kind of arrogance is why they are going out of business.  I hope the other big boxes don't learn this lesson the easy way and they go out of business too.<p>It's sounds very cynical to say it, but I think the world will be better off without brick and mortar stores like Circuit City.<p>Actually, it makes me very excited to see them going out of business. I know it is painful for a lot of the employees and I don't mean to relish in their pain, but it's proof that rationality wins in the end.<p>The Circuit City bankruptcy is a metaphor for the U.S. It's a signal that the old world is dying and a new world is being born -- online.  Consumers are being smarter about their money. They don't have anymore credit cards to max out, the housing ATMs are broken and people are wising up.<p>We're all going to be smarter and better and more rational after the fire.  Slash and burn.

450193,comment,245227,245369,0,0,kragen,,,"Mathematics started maybe 2500 years ago.  Calculus wasn't discovered until less than 400 years ago.  The crisis in mathematics spawned by non-Euclidean geometry didn't happen until less then 200 years ago.  Symbolic logic was in the last century or two.<p>Biology is presumably older.  No need to point out what we've done in the last century.<p>Herbal medicine goes back much further than we have records.  But penicillin (from molds) wasn't discovered until the 1930s.<p>Ironworking goes back 3000 years.  The Bessemer process was developed less than 200 years ago.<p>Archery and animal husbandry go back to the Stone Age.  But less than 1000 years ago, new developments in horseback archery were crucial to Genghis Khan's conquest of most of Eurasia.<p>Plant breeders have been studying plant heredity and breeding more productive cultivars since the Stone Age.  Then 50-some years ago we discovered the structure of DNA, and now we have a remarkable variety of projects based on it.<p>A ""mature subfield"" is just one that had its last big development a while ago.  In the case of ""systems,"" that development in 2000 had been perhaps minicomputers or C.  Pike was right in 2000 but his polemic is not applicable to 2009.<p>Look what's happened since 2000.  MapReduce.  Eventual consistency all over the place.  Software transactional memory (even if that turns out not to pan out, there are lots of people using ZODB already).  Google App Engine. Virtualization (VMWare has 3000 employees) and paravirtualization (XenSource's work is based on the RTLinux approach pioneered at New Mexico Tech), which incidentally involve new operating system kernels.  Google Native Client.  Widespread use of mobile code in AJAX apps.  Haskell and OCaml are becoming usable and have been used in a few widespread apps.  The inner loops of games are written in Cg or HLSL. OS X introduced a new way to structure Unix graphics (which is now being used by Compiz).  JIT compilation has gone mainstream in the JVM, the CLR, and Chrome v8.  We build our GUIs in Flex or DHTML instead of GDI or Quartz or even X.  The hot new software is all written in Ruby or new dialects of Lisp.  The majority of internet traffic is BitTorrent, which didn't exist in 2000.  People develop software in refactoring IDEs.  We store our files in decentralized source-control systems that use self-certifying names, like Git and Mercurial.  Sun's hottest new products are a filesystem and a profiler.  Firefox is having XPCOM ripped out of it largely by means of automated transformations of C++ code.  Transmeta failed but you can hardly claim they weren't applying systems software research in industry.  TCP/IP now does service autodiscovery the way Appletalk used to, so groups of people with laptops collaboratively take notes in real-time with SubEthaEdit.  Lightroom was largely written in Lua, from a university in Brazil; lots of games are scripted in it.  Lots of other apps are written largely in Python, which came from a university in Holland and then CNRI.  C and C++ are much less dominant than they were in 2000.  OS X runs on CMU's Mach.<p>Today, systems software --- operating systems, networking, languages --- is an <i>extremely</i> active field today, with lots and lots of research being done that's highly relevant to and influential in industry.  Most of the exciting demos I see these days are noncommercial or come from corporate R&D labs.  There's still ossified and insular research but there's also a huge explosion of new and innovative research.  Instead of a high-end workstation with Unix, X, Emacs, TCP/IP, Netscape, C, C++, Java, and Perl, now we have Unix (often in the form of MacOS or Linux+GNOME or KDE), X (with Compiz), Emacs (revitalized!) or Eclipse or SharpDevelop; Firefox with Firebug, Flash, Canvas, AdBlock Plus, and GreaseMonkey instead of Netscape 4, or just as likely some WebKit browser; TCP/IP but with zeroconf, IPv6, and 802.11; C#, Java, Python, Ruby, and above all JavaScript.",1232961460

At least enough to be able to do simple websites (or modify designs that you outsourced to integrate them in your website.)<p>For css try to use and understand a framework like blueprint or better even compass which is a meta-framework ported on sass (sass is to css what haml is to html). It will save you a lot of time by not having to deal so much with browser inconsistencies).<p>On the javascript side, read the book ""Javascript the good parts"" from Douglas Crockford, watch his videos and then play with jquery (it's very sweet and simple to use).<p>One last recommendation on the front end is to read Steve Souders ""High performance websites"". It's a quick easy read and highlights a lot of important considerations for the front end performance (like this you'll know for example that it's a good idea to ask designer to slice images that they use as background in the css file)...<p>It doesn't mean that you need to do everything by yourself (I hate doing css for example) but having a thorough understanding will help you chose the right web designer to work with and make sure that you both speak the same language.",1232960806
450183,comment,450167,450167,0,0,thwarted,,,"I'm not sure that ""because X was first"" is that much different than ""because X has users"" or ""because X has 90% of the market"", so that isn't really that shallow of an answer.  The challenge is to get people to switch services from one that they are already comfortable and successful using, and sites like craigslist, ebay, and google already have a significant headstart by being both first (long ago) and good.<p>It's not just enough to say ""we have a better search engine than google"" if you want to dethrone google, you actually have to be better (although the former may get you funding).  Witness Cuil.  Or Live -- who tried to pay people to use their search engine: even the lure of easy money isn't enough to get people to switch.  With places like craigslist and ebay, the first mover advantage is significant.  These sites bring two parties together.  Those who have something to sell and those who have something to buy.  The sellers want to be where the buyers are and the buyers will go where the sellers are.<p>It is possible to have a successful business as a small time competitor to an established, entrenched player, but if your goal is to be competitive, you've got a long uphill battle ahead of you.  It may be wiser to redefine the industry or look at it from another angle, then tackle that.  What does craigslist do really bad that could be better?  Is the lack of a competitor that eases that pain the reason why people still use the incumbent?<p>I'm not sure what craigslist's weak points are.  The site is extremely minimal, search works reasonably well, people automatically sort most things into the right places (because otherwise they'd be wasting their time), the majority of posters don't need to pay, fraud is managed well enough that people are not looking for something else.  I can't think of any weak points -- which may be why I'm not working on craigslist competitor.",1232960409

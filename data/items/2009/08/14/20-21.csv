In the real world they are often used in an anti-REST way, specified in advance instead of linked via hypermedia.<p>A design that uses only opaque UUIDs as names for resources and reveals them to the client via links in the responses is perfect REST. Clean-looking URIs are a distraction, except that they tend to be easier to preserve across software rewrites.",1250283590

763821,comment,763068,763068,0,0,ewjordan,,,"IMO the simplest resolution of things like the grandfather paradox are obtained by including quantum mechanics in the equation.<p>Usually in quantum mechanics we find that waves are quantized because they must be periodic over very tiny reaches of space, and the quantization comes about because only certain frequencies of wave can meet themselves over these distances.<p>But if we have time loops, it's pretty much the same thing, except the consistency conditions can be experienced on arbitrarily large scales - the quantum state where I kill my own grandfather is not a self-consistent loop, and won't exist as a solution to the wave equations.  In essence, the ""wave"" that describes me killing my grandfather will interfere with itself over the time loop, and will eventually (hopefully?  I don't have a proof...) converge on a wave that <i>does</i> reinforce itself, and ends up consistent.  This may require a pretty serious divergence from what we'd usually assume about classical physics, even at the macroscopic scale.<p>So quantization is the <i>real</i> reason we shouldn't worry about the grandfather paradox; any solution to the equations of QM will <i>have to be</i> self consistent over a closed timelike loop, even if the results are ridiculous as far as classical mechanics is concerned.",1250283254

Struts is another, actually a container in a container. Having messed around in J2ee land for while this article made me realize that most folks didn't know or didn't care what a stock J2ee container could do if one started thinking RESTfully.<p>Then we built a whole enterprise web application using just a stock J2ee container and RESTful style thinking. How much simpler! No extra frameworks to learn. The UI became completely decoupled from the services. The services are completely decoupled from the J2ee container, naturally. All the container does is resolve the nouns to a service name and give a call back to the appropriate verb method, doGet, doPut, doDelete.<p>In fairness we are not 100% RESTful there is some legacy stuff that relies on the session. However having done a few SOAP/WSDL services and tons of Struts actions or Spring ""injections"" I must say that REST is in my opinion a much cleaner way to code for web apps. Whenever I hear about some implementation needing a SOAP/WSDL service I run the other way as fast as possible. I won't even debate folks about it anymore, I just refuse to work on all that complexity.<p>As an aside I have seen here and there some frameworks the purport to use REST. I don't really get this. Why would somebody need and additional framework to make something RESTful? I have done it with J2ee and just plain Apache.

There are several types of programming: applications development, systems programming and algorithm/data structure development.<p>I'm a systems programmer who is trying to pick up a greater deal of algorithm and data structure knowledge. I view applications as moving to <i>the web</i> but for web application to become efficient, scalable and allow for the same rich UI as a desktop application a <i>great deal</i> of difficult systems engineering and algorithm development had to happen first. More so than for a desktop application.<p>Desktop applications typically store individual user data:  you could easily use an O(N) lookup structure to store it and then use just write() to write it out to disk as a C struct. Web applications are multi-tenant. For the largest web applications, even a relational database (an incredibly complex system: transaction protocols, b+trees for storage) can't scale.<p>Before any <i>reputable</i> company puts their name on application, the application has to be load balanced. Yet, this is transparent to the user. Do typical desktop applications require a shared nothing distributed architecture?<p>Now on the other hand, web developers don't think about these issues and write in powerful, high-level languages using frameworks and DSLs which often times don't even require writing SQL code. Yet, they aren't doing in this in vacuum.<p>So really the case here is that web application development appears, on the surface, to be less challenging than desktop application development. Yet the amount of systems programming that <i>had to happen</i> to allow that is immense.<p>Am I now saying that systems programming is more challenging than applications development? No, the challenges are different. I don't have <i>nearly</i> the sort of patience and attention to detail that UI development requires. The process (gathering <i>user</i> requirements, presenting mockups) is actually <i>more</i> complex.<p>If you're looking to do lower-level work, or more algorithm/data structure development because that's what <i>you</i> find challenging than don't be an applications developer (whether desktop or web). On the other hand, be aware that the demand for systems programmers isn't always as high (and getting the job is a lot more difficult in terms of complexity of even the interview and the experience/education level required).<p>On the other hand, before web developers bash statically typed languages (especially C/C++), bash CS curiculla that stress algorithms and data structures or wonder why interviewers at Google/Yahoo/Facebook ask about Binary Trees, they should be aware just how much of C/C++ code was written for them to be able to do even the simplest of SELECT statements (and if you don't know what data structures might have been traversed when you issued that statement, I won't hire you).",1250282072

In large part, everyone gets to share and benefit from their output -- and  most of those benefiting would have had no direct financial involvement with the work.<p>So, here we have a model where the product is available for free while the creators somehow earn a living (probably by being domain experts or by knowing how to apply their free ""product"" in the context of something more specifically revenue generating).<p>How is there not a correlation with; and a counterexample to; some of the arguments from the parent comment?",1250281967

You just like arguing, apparently.<p>Firstly, even in the first ""disclosure"" message - the passwords are indeed safe. Because of that ""useless"" peppering, there is no way the attackers will be able to unmask the hashes.<p>Secondly, if you have configured your database such that it is even possible to perform a select all on Users from the app server account, you are Doing It Wrong.<p>However, you are broadly right.<p>That said - my whole thesis here is that there are no magic bullets. Yes bcrypt is (much) better against this particular attack. But the DB server is not even web-facing and is unlikely to be compromised; the app servers are far more risky. They have access to the plaintext passwords flowing through them. When they are rooted, you're fucked no matter what hashing strategy you chose. And if you have a crooked insider - which as a security professional, you will know is by far the more likely risk - that's where they will strike as well, of course. Your precious passwords will be bcrypt hashed to the DB all right, but Mallory keeps his own plaintext backup, written by the comped bcrypt gem he snuck onto the system looking for a payday. Or whatever. There's a million ways to do it, all of them easier than brute forcing anything. You're focusing on this single scenario to the exclusion of any number of more likely attacks.

447882,comment,446349,447106,0,0,c1sc0,,,"Define ""own business"": I guess if you are looking for multi-million dollar businesses being run in someone's spare time, yeah, you won't find many examples. But what about the guy who simply wants to have a second source of income by running something in his spare time? Plenty of examples of people who turn a hobby into something that resembles a business. Plenty of people earning a second income by trading <i>something</i>, creating <i>something</i>. How much revenue is enough? 5K / month?",1232783833

447880,comment,447498,447734,0,0,numair,,,"You make the classic mistake of arguing against the record industry as a means for arguing against payment for intellectual property... While the record industry is involved in this, and they are the chief whiners, the overall situation is much greater.  We have an entire generation of people around the world who see no point in paying for intellectual property.<p>This may actually be a situation in which society has made a decision to change its values, in which case the situation is irreversible, or will require a new generation before it can change.  See: smoking, equal rights, etc.",1232783629
447879,comment,446924,447765,0,0,chris11,,,"I agree with that. Normally with newspapers there is nothing of interest to read after a certain amount of time spent reading. But on social news sites, an interesting article can appear anytime. It's basic operant conditioning. After a variable amount of time, you get the reinforcement of reading an interesting article. And the VR(variable reinforcement) schedule happens to be the most addictive. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Schedules_of_reinforcement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Schedules_of_rein...</a> And the Fixed Interval (FI) schedule, which sounds like what you are suggesting is also the least rewarding.

447871,comment,446349,446897,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I have and have had several coworkers that remained very productive at work while running their own businesses on the side.<p>My own personal experience was much as you say.  (I kept my day job for 8 months while trying to do my startup on the side.)  Eventually I found that the startup was all-consuming, I couldn't concentrate well on my day job, so I quit.<p>I can't help thinking that maybe this is because of my inexperience as an entrepreneur, though.  Because several people <i>have</i> created successful startups while employed by someone else.  Steve Wozniak did the Apple I, video controllers, floppy disks, and all sorts of other hardware while employed by HP.  Pierre Omidyar created E-bay and grew it to profitability before he quit his day job.  Joshua Schacter wrote del.icio.us while employed by Morgan Stanley.  Bill Gates grew Microsoft while both he and Paul Allen were employed by Altair.",1232782490

Once you attempt to build a site of a reasonably level of complexity and/or learn how to build a site using clean, valid, semantic markup, you'll never go back - unless horribly messy code and hack piled upon hack are your thing.<p>This isn't about being a web standards zealot.  It's about learning to do your job.  Look to any of the industry leaders in frontend development - it is simply no longer an issue.

But thanks for the encouragement!<p>People have written quality content for awhile now, agreed.  They did so before the word processor too.  My claim is that I will speed up the polishing process for writers using my product.<p>My tool is a billy club, bopping writers over the head with their bad habits.  We all have them.  How many engineers write ""utilize"" over ""use"".  You may think, ""who cares?"" but read a paper where everything is said with complex words, passive voice, etc.--it gets dense.<p>One of my favorite books is Write to the Point by Bill Stott.  He advocates concise writing to communicate ideas quickly.  I breezed through his book like it was a Neil Stephenson novel.  This is a testimony to the difference clear writing makes.<p>Sure, I'm hocking a product, but I also believe in what it does.",1232781026

If the primary languages they listed in the description are HTML, CSS, and JS, then this is probably what they imagined you'd be doing from the beginning.<p>On the other hand, if you a ""programmer"" proper and the primary languages listed are Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, etc., then I could understand a little frustration.  But keep in mind - if you're working in web and doing any frontend work at all, most employers will (rightly) expect that you have these skills.<p>I hope the position you've found works out for you, or that you're able to find something better that you'd prefer.<p>Good luck!",1232780929
447850,comment,447760,447760,0,0,nostrademons,,,"One approach might be to point out the hourly wage of a good designer.  Point out your own hourly wage.  Then point out that it takes you 2-3 times longer for lower quality work.  If you feel the need to be explicit, do the math for them.  Most companies will listen to economic arguments.<p>(Though they may ""listen"" by laying you off, if they don't have other work for you.  Still, it's the same outcome as if you quit, and you get to collect unemployment.)<p>If that doesn't work, bite the bullet and learn some minimal Photoshop.  I'm not a designer either.  But I've had to ""cut"" Photoshop mockups on a few occasions (mostly in my own startup, where there was nobody else to do it).  <i>Somebody</i> has to perform the translation from graphic to web page, and it's usually easier for web developers to learn a little Photoshop than it is for designers to learn good HTML.",1232780821

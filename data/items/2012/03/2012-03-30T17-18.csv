Let me explain.<p>The problem with email today is that it has many uses which we try to manage through a single client that has gone mostly unchanged for 20 years.  You've brilliantly picked up on this. Having a separate app for managing notifications seems obvious now that I've seen your product, don't know why I never thought of it before this.<p>However being able to delete notifications is absolutely essential.

Legally, it was ""the right"" thing to do.<p>But personally, I feel I paid the people that are screwing me -- as one person recently commented about the content industry, he was ceasing to pay those people so that they could use the money to force their evermore draconian policies (of self-interest) on him and society.<p>Furthermore, due to Adobe's clear mistakes, I needed support from Adobe Support.  And despite all the money they had received from me, the experience was absolutely horrible.  Eventually, <i>I</i> was the one explaining (repeatedly) to their support technicians what they needed to do.

You have a Trader Joes that's a 10 minute walk. You have a Michelin star restaurant that's a 10 minute walk. I could go on and on, but basically, you have dozens and dozens of nice, reasonably priced bars, coffee shops, butcher shops, produce stores, movie theaters (well those aren't so reasonably priced) and restaurants that are a 10 minute walk. And you have a 35 minute commute to midtown... 20 minutes to SOHO. That's not bad at all.<p>However if you measure quality of life by the cleanliness of the subway or having to wait 15 minutes because you just missed the last F train or it annoys you that a lot of people commute during rush hour, then yeah, NYC probably isn't for you.<p>Your knock on consumption culture is overstated.

Luckily my dad was an engineer and was more than happy to answer all my questions. In university I was also surrounded by people who were fascinated by how things worked. Because of that I'm still very surprised when I meet people who show no such interest. That said, I now know quite a few people who fall in that category. They're all very smart people, with good educations, but they're just okay with the fact that things exist.<p>The dangerous thing about this attitude though is that these people often underestimate what it takes for something to be created. You see this when politicians are eager to cut on education or when someone looks for a programmer to 'quickly implement their briliant new app'. Note that these people aren't necessarily dumb, but they've just never thought about what it takes for things to be built or designed.",1333130046

When I spend a lot of time programming, however, I tend to become more cautious, analytical, and insensitive. Partly this is because any time spent programming is, generally speaking, spent away from people and in ignorance of our bodies (and hence, our environments). This is one reason why I think it is so important for engineers to have diverse interests.<p>It's not just so that we will be kinder to each other on Hacker News. We are, in a very significant way, the people building the future. We need to make sure that we are in the right frame of mind to build a future we want to live in, and not one that is anti-social and inhumane.<p>Perhaps the reason dystopian sci-fi has so much resonance is because we are already experiencing, unconsciously, the dehumanizing effects of technology.",1333129428

The fact that you said the king is <i>not</i> an ass proves that you had the idea that he <i>is</i>. So I think your alternate interpretation of the principle is not so different from the first. The claim is that negation is a logical/abstract construct that exists at a higher cognitive level not recognized by the (allegedly) more primitive unconscious, which deals in concrete language and images.<p>Another way to put it is that psychologically, a statement and its negation are not opposites but rather go together. The same idea comes up in hypnosis, where it is said that the unconscious mind drops the ""not"" and simply receives the images that are given. For the same reason, it's better to say ""Remember"" than ""Don't forget"", which is a kind of subliminal invitation to forget. And so on.",1333129384

Extreme Programming is not an arbitrary desire to turn all the knobs you can find to 11. It started as a question: what happens if we take certain practices that are good and do them more intensely? E.g. if some testing is good, what if we test pretty much everything?<p>That team found that they really liked turning particular practices way up. But you can't turn all the knobs up, so you are implicitly turning others down. E.g., if you turn up iteration speed, then you are turning down the sort of heavyweight waterfall requirements process ubiquitous at the time.<p>So the ""extreme"" was a way to explore the space of possible processes, not any sort of fundamental principle. Teams trying XP are explicitly encouraged to experiment similarly. I sure have; the process we use is derived from XP but departs from it in a number of areas.<p>I think a lot of the rest of your points are similar misunderstandings along with some cherry picking. E.g., the OM blog post on pairing. He said that people sometimes asked him for basic background materials, so he posted some links. To go from that to ""Brett Schuchert apparently advocates pair programming based on.."" is either very poor reading comprehension or the act of somebody with an axe to grind.<p>As to not doing TDD being unprofessional, I'd generally agree. I tried TDD first in 2001, and have worked on a number of code bases since. For any significant code base that's meant to last and be maintainable, I think it's irresponsible to not have a good unit test suite. I also think there's no more efficient way to get a solid suite than TDD.<p>If you (or anybody) wants to discuss this further, probably better to email me; that's easy to find from my profile.",1333129365

3777024,comment,3776150,3776150,1,0,mindslight,,,"I agree with what appears to be your general goal, but various points:<p>1. You need to refine your argument. I suspect your main point <i>is</i> philosophical and political, but you detract from it by setting up a nebulous security argument. The security concerns you describe are non-issues. Turing completeness says nothing of the available IO primitives, hence why people counter with sandboxing. Solving XSS is as conceptually simple as having any js-initiated request include the identity of what initiated it (in the case of XSS, the other site), and server frameworks having a whitelist of such initiators. But in general, a user shouldn't be even worried about cross site scripting as they're not meant to have control over it - their only input is whether to rely on the total security of a specific site.<p>2. Executable blobs are the lowest common denominator (any concept can be realized in them) so new concepts tend to be implemented in them rather than engineering a more declarative format. Furthermore, users are lazy and auto-updating of software (in this case, on every page load) is a net win. However, apt-get also gives me these very nice properties.<p>3. This is where the philosophy comes in - users should be in control of the software they use! Web 2.0 is actually <i>proprietary software 2.0</i>! Browser extensions can modify the applications to some extent, but are fighting an uphill battle due to the difficulty in analyzing Turing-complete blobs. I presume this is your real motivating factor in wanting to change the expressive power of scripts, but as long as the code has more expressiveness than a simple declarative format, you can never actually tame it. (Imagine a server framework that re-obfuscates the client-side code every hour).<p>4. One fundamental issue to address is <i>naming</i> the code so that end users may gain control over administering it. One doesn't install a new version of CAD software in the middle of a project, as their goal is to finish the project and not get bogged down figuring out how to use a new version. I only dist-upgrade when I'm willing to accept a few days of shaking out changes. Contrast with the current web, where a site will make unilateral changes and the only recourse of users is to complain. One should be able to locally 'roll back to the previous version of this site', and the site should support that by decoupling their code and data model.<p>5. Another major issue is data store and ""network"" independence. If one doesn't like the changes site A is making to the software, they should be able to switch to a competing site B, and have their data and connections intact - akin to several programs using the same file format. This of course requires fundamental site openness, with is directly counter to the standard web-hollywood business model of becoming the middleman in an n^2 network, so I expect eventual disruption rather than gradual change.",1333127937

You can pick an NP-complete problem with a large input data set and make halting depend upon the outcome. It will take a very long time to determine if such an application halts or not, since you have to solve the NP-complete problem.<p>Of course, if you care only about states the application could potentially reach, instead of those it actually does reach, you could do this much faster.

The job market for computational biologists in industry is tight and problem-specific, and you'll generally need some research experience before you can land a gig -- there's not much computational biology going on that isn't considered ""research"" (even in industry).<p>That said, I'd recommend you start off by looking for a programmer gig in a good research lab.  It's not as difficult to get one of these jobs because good CS students usually go into other fields, and academic labs are more willing to train.  Spend a few years there learning the process of research, and you'll be much better qualified for an industry job.  You'll also have a better idea if you really want to pursue computational biology as a career.<p>Other posts in this thread recommend applying for engineering jobs at biomedical startups (23andMe, Counsyl, etc.)  That could be a decent option, but remember:  if you're working on the website (or the robots, or...), you're not learning how to do computational biology.  So it may not be the best long-term choice if you're interested in the science.  Make sure that the position fits your long-term goals.<p>Finally, the general rule in computational biology is that ""biology"" is the most important word.  From the perspective of a biology researcher, programmers are a commodity -- an expensive commodity, but still generic and interchangeable -- but <i>biologists</i> who know computer science are rare.  The only way to ensure long-term success in this field is to be the latter.  So regardless of what kind of job you pursue, make sure that you're spending at least as much time learning the problem domain as you are learning about computers.

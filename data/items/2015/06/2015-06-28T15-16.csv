It&#x27;s also good to learn how to interact with women while not drinking (cue Raj from The Big Bang Theory). Women pick up on a man that is confident in his own skin.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for LA, but when I was living in SF I would usually get on OkCupid or Tinder and arrange meetup dates at local coffeeshops. It was an easy first date. If there were no red flags at the coffeeshop, I would ask the woman to a second activity date doing something we both enjoyed.<p>Hope this helps, Good Luck!",1435506094

9793801,comment,9792454,9793160,0,0,modfodder,,,"My brother is an exec for a large independent oil company heavily invested in fracking.  I live in NYC.  After having long conversations with him about his job, the company and the industry, I&#x27;m glad fracking in NY is banned for several reasons.<p>The industry is too secretive about the chemicals they are pumping into the ground.  I don&#x27;t care they say the chemicals are safe.  Don&#x27;t really care the EPA says they are safe.  What I care about is a private company pumping undisclosed chemicals into huge swaths of public and private lands.  What the EPA says is safe now, we may discover is actually damaging (and the EPA is far from a trustworthy party, they&#x27;ve ignored environmental concerns in the past).  If you truly believe it is safe, disclose the chemical soup.  When you are pumping that much shit into the environment you shouldn&#x27;t have the right to argue trade secrets.<p>The industry doesn&#x27;t care about the public&#x27;s safety if it stands in the way of profit.  Companies large and small will cut corners to increase profit and when that happens, the public pays the price.  The industry will ignore environmental problems until the chorus is loud enough, then they&#x27;ll argue there isn&#x27;t enough information (look at fracking and the Oklahoma earthquakes).  Well, if there isn&#x27;t enough information to free you from blame, there probably isn&#x27;t enough information to prove what you are doing is safe, so stop until we have that information, the risks to the environment and public are too great.<p>The country has bent over backwards for the oil industry for far too long.  It&#x27;s time to make them jump through more hoops than they can imagine.  Let&#x27;s bend over backwards for the renewables industry a change (where I believe the oil companies should be taking a lead anyway, you&#x27;re an energy company, diversify).<p>The EPA didn&#x27;t say fracking was safe and reported several instances of contaminated water because of fracking. What the EPA report said was the number of contaminated wells was small compared to the number of wells.  The EPA believes the problems with water pollution are not systemic to fracking.<p>From the EPA:
&quot;We did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. Of the potential mechanisms identified in this report, we found specific instances where one or more mechanisms led to impacts on drinking water resources, including contamination of drinking water wells. The number of identified cases, however, was small compared to the number of hydraulically fractured wells.&quot;<p>One of the largest concerns with fracking is surface water pollution. The flowback liquid from fracking contains water and a number of contaminants, including radioactive material, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and other toxins. This wastewater is stored on the fracking site in open air pits, injected into deep underground wells or disposed of off-site at a wastewater treatment facility (few small town facilities can handles fracking flowback).<p>The industry has a long history of ignoring old, aging well sites and pipelines that eventually start polluting because maintenance was stopped to increase profits.<p>It&#x27;s very simple.  If the industry didn&#x27;t have a long history of choosing the pollution causing bottom line over the public&#x27;s interest, I&#x27;d have fewer problems with fracking.  The industry has made great strides in trying to be a better neighbor but they have a long way to go before I find them even remotely trustworthy.<p>Edit:  I don&#x27;t have a problem with oil as an energy source, it&#x27;s an important industry.  I have a problem with bad actors and the oil industry has been allowed to become one big bad actor.  You want a pipeline across the country?  No problem, show me that you can build one that one that won&#x27;t break or leak, and when it does, show me you&#x27;ll take responsibility and fix the problem (and all the other problems caused by your leaky pipeline).  The oil industry has a long history of ignoring, dodging or shifting blame.  As long as they continue to do that I believe we should be shifting our focus, our money and our back bending to alternative energy sources.",1435504583

Is it really only coming from other traders like him, but who in that instance happened to make a bad decision? In other words, i would say it would perhaps not be that bad if the pool of cash from which such traders were fishing were entirely made up of inlay by other such traders, such as would be the case at a casino at a poker table... What i&#x27;m trying to enunciate is a vague uneasiness that somehow, making so much cash without contributing anything to society seems... Unfortunate, to say the least? Isn&#x27;t there something useful somebody like that could do, instead of amassing a fortune by &quot;gaming the market&quot;?<p>I have nowhere near enough knowledge on the subject to suggest a workable method of regulation or anything like that, but i really wonder how something that boils down to somebody gaming the market (as somebody else said, the only gambling which is legal in all states) to the tune of millions is anything but detrimental.",1435503825

Elon Musk didn&#x27;t say that in response to the Antares explosion, he said it <i>several years earlier</i>, and the part that&#x27;s quoted is pretty accurate to be fair.<p>When a failure does happen, nobody goes around celebrating it, whether they&#x27;re competitors or not, and honestly I believe that includes Elon Musk. I believe that on a human level, but even on a business level it&#x27;s bad, because it reduces public faith in space transportation generally. Nobody likes to see this happen.<p>:(",1435503803

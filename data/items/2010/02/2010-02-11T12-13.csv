I am 48 and I am ""in IT"" and I work mostly with men between the ages of 21 and 27. Despite their youth, their very long/very short hair, and their t-shirts, some of them are genuine fuddy-duddies (old-fashioned, conservative, set in their thinking, however you want to call it).

We have a lot of rules on describing ingredients and nutrition in food, some statutory, others widely accepted industrial practices. However, even the statutory rules let food suppliers ""forget"" certain things, like IIRC up to 10% of added water in meat products. In other words, they can legally say ""no added water"" with anything up to 10% added, or reduce greater actual amounts accordingly. I'm not sure I see any public interest in that kind of rule, unless it really is an essential part of the production process that literally everyone (including the local butcher with a local supplier competing with the supermarkets) is going to have to do.",1265890291

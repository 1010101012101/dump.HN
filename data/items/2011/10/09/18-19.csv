The comparison should not be made to radio royalties because radio play has been shown to increase sales, since if you want to hear a specific song you heard on the radio, you still have to buy it or sit around waiting for it to come on.

3090992,comment,3090457,3090879,1,0,hollerith,,,">Instead of proving him wrong about 3 things, can you prove him wrong about 1 thing?<p>OK. One of the things on his list is, ""Concurrent url fetching and downloads"". In Emacs Lisp a programmer can call START-PROCESS to invoke wget ""asynchronously"" (i.e., in such a way that the Emacs process can continue to respond to the user's commands). Moreover, Emacs Lisp includes a way (which I do not remember and cannot easily look up) to arrange for code to be run when the wget process terminates. So obviously this code can read the file downloaded by the wget process, load it into an editing buffer, then bring that buffer (or more precisely a window onto that buffer) into the foreground (or notify the user that it is ready in some other way).<p>I know enough about Unix to know that START-PROCESS is doing a fork and an exec, and my reading of the source code file /lisp/man.el told me that Unix signals would almost certainly be involved in notifying the Emacs Lisp code when the wget process is done.<p>START-PROCESS probably does not work on Windows BTW.<p>ADDED. The above example of concurrency is so simple that it might give the reader a misleading impression about Emacs. So let me just say that although I use OS X, I almost never use Terminal or iTerm or such because I prefer to use Emacs buffers (in shell mode) to interact with Unix shells and other programs with command-line interfaces. If I were to start a long-running computation in one (shell-mode) buffer, I could use Emacs for unrelated tasks while the computation is running.",1318185712

Then your project gets delayed, and all of a sudden you're running out of cash to pay the actual programmers. Do you try to make them take a cut and risk them jumping ship, or do you cut your own salary to close the cash gap?<p>These sorts of things happen with (from what little I know) quite alarming regularity. The founders are almost certainly taking out less cash than everyone else up until the equity starts being traded.<p>The same sorts of decisions can occur even if you're not desperately squeezed for cash. Do you bump your personal wage up, or do you use it to hire that kickass designer you just found who can really polish up your stuff and give you a better chance at success?<p>The whole founder-as-martyr approach explains why they feel justified in taking out early cash, and why there's a general feeling that '1st employee' shouldn't get any early cash - they've already gotten their fair share through their wages up til now.  It gets a lot more complicated when your employee is taking a pay-cut to work for you on the hopes you'll succeed, but then it's up to you and them to negotiate some sort of fair compensation scheme when you do get cash in.",1318185659

OTOH, a tyre is a tyre is a trye in most cases, just as most of Intels chips are sold to anybody who is prepared to place an order.<p>Im not making any specific point, just suggesting we be clear about what we mean when drawing comparisons between designing CPUs and outsourcing part or all of the manufacture of an automobile.",1318185398
3090972,comment,3089259,3090209,1,0,jodoherty,,,"No problem, but I would encourage you to reconsider your train of thought.<p>The LPK25 is limited, but it's definitely more convenient for getting down ideas than using a computer keyboard, since once you have it set as the MIDI input device in an application, you can hit keys and play notes without having to worry about what application is in focus and what its keyboard shortcuts are. Computer keyboards also only recognize up to a certain number of keys being held down simultaneously (since they're designed with the assumption that you won't be pressing five keys in the same row at the same time) and don't provide velocity or intensity information, but you always get note intensity and velocity MIDI information out of a MIDI keyboard. As for the limited number of keys, you can shift the keyboard down or up entire octaves with the buttons on the left and then record the left and right hand parts separately in two passes. You can also look at it and see what notes you're pressing instead of having to translate between a computer keyboard and a musical keyboard.<p>So I'd say it's quite useful compared to having just a computer keyboard, and the small size means you're that much more likely to have it with your computer, even if your computer is a laptop and you travel a lot. Your argument that it only does what you could still do with a computer keyboard is like saying the virtual keyboard on an iPad is just as good as using a bluetooth keyboard, since they offer the same keys and basic functionality... so a bluetooth keyboard for the iPad is useless. But you'll probably still want to use that bluetooth keyboard with the iPad if you're doing any amount of writing, because it just makes it easier to type (and it frees up the screen space for what you're writing).<p>If you have the desk space though, Behringer makes some cheap gear that usually works fine, so go with a larger keyboard and check out the Behringer UMX610, which should work perfectly with Linux:<p><a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/672870-REG/Behringer_UMX610_UMX610_USB_MIDI_Keyboard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/672870-REG/Behringer_U...</a><p>You could even use such a keyboard for actual performances if you absolutely had to, but it probably doesn't play as nicely as your Casio, and you should probably figure out your latency problems in Linux. (To be honest, if I were doing anything music related on an everyday basis, I'd much rather use Cubase on a Mac. Linux software is a disheveled mess of parts that can fit together quite nicely, but can also cause a lot of hairpulling too.)<p>Finally, you probably don't want to hear this, but if you have time and energy for ear training practice, relative pitch recognition would make your life a lot easier and solve most of your problems. Then if you can work out what the first few notes of your song are and you figure out the key, you can figure out how to write down the rest pretty easily from there. Then you could use some of the score editing software, trackers, or anything else that people mentioned in the other replies.<p>As it is now, it sounds like most of your musical fluency is trapped away in the muscle memory of your hands, and that's the real source of your current problem, since it's the same as being able to speak and listen, maybe even read a bit, but not write anything.<p>Anyway, just something to consider. Good luck, and I hope you find something that works for you.",1318185327

Double the year, add more risk and zeros to the income/gains figures and you'll see why raising taxes on capital gains will take away the incentive to start a business.

When a save is requested, you make a copy of the buffer in memory (so that what ends up on disk is what the buffer looked like exactly when the save was requested), then you stream this data to disk with aio_write (perhaps making the write atomic by doing a synchronous rename after all the data is on disk).  This would probably take no more than a few hours to implement, and most of the complexity is simple to handle with atomic writes and aio_cancel.  I think the biggest problem is handling the ""userspace"" semantics; after-save hooks expect to run after the data is on disk but before the user has changed the buffer in any way.  What do you do about this?<p>(I've done this before.  I have an Emacs mode at work that saves to a special centralized database in addition to the local disk at every modification.

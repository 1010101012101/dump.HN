We plan to gradually integrate location and purchases into this stream. 
Foursquare integration: A user will see a list of recent check-ins and be allowed to enter purchases made at these locations. Blippy integration: A user's credit card swipes will be pulled into the Spibby stream from Blippy. Points will be earned from a combination of swipes, transactions and Spibby posts (and the conversations around these posts).<p>NOTE: In its current avatar, Spibby might seem like a non-automated version of Blippy / Swipely, but that's quite intentional - we hope to integrate with these services and eventually build our game on top their APIs. The value-add around the user generated posts (that we currently allow) is the ability to discuss wishlists / cash transactions / questions before a purchase, which we think is quite significant.<p>We'd like to a) receive feedback and b) start building a community as early as we can. Spibby, right now, is extremely basic - we let you make simple posts and follow other users, but we've already seen some interesting conversations unfold between our initial users.<p>We're quite sure we're in for some really compelling feedback from the HN community. 
1) We'd love to hear what you think of the concept.
2) We'd like to know if you think the path we're taking (from MVP to version 1.0) and our complete apathy towards stealth makes sense

But it does <i>not</i>, in any way, mean that the people would have the same level of success exploiting it as they do Windows.<p>We could probably safely expect that the platform would be successfully exploited more than it currently is. And people that think OS X is a security panacea are living in a fantasy world. But the argument that ""[i]f everyone jumps to another OS so will the security problems"" is a woeful oversimplification, and confuses two separate issues.<p>Also, as a side note, people seriously underestimate the level of incentive that currently exists for targeting non-Windows platforms. It is <i>not</i> the case that the incentive scales proportionally to audience size. Any sufficiently popular platform is a desirable target to attack. It's not like a platform has to have 90% of the market to be worth the effort. The relative ease of attack is a far more important factor than the potential audience size once we're talking millions of users.",1275353315

You may argue about Z but people should make those decisions for themselves.</i><p>You certainly can argue with numbers. Numbers do not burst forth from the head of Zeus; they are always produced in a particular context and that context provides fertile grounds for argument. Here's an example: is the mean temperature of the earth changing? We have datasets from weather stations all over the globe going back centuries. But there are people who claim that many of these weather stations used to be located in rural areas that have become more developed over time and that this development can introduce heat islands that create the illusion of global warming. This is not an obviously false claim. These people can and do argue with the numbers. Later research by scientists has shown that this claim is wrong anyway, but lay people lack the time and training to figure that out on their own. And it seems bizarre to expect them to.<p><i>If the data is out there, more people will see the truth.</i><p>I don't think this is true at all. People do not generally scrutinize raw data.

So except for the (sometimes small-n) studies on specific cognitive abilities that Stanovich cites, there has yet to be validation of ""rationality"" for occupational counseling or the like. What has been shown, very well indeed, is persistent cognitive illusions that result in irrational decisions, even among persons presumptively selected by high IQ score, such as financial professionals. Behavioral economists have of course been very interested in these issues, and Stanovich cites their primary research papers extensively in his book. Some of those experiments have been replicated by dozens of investigators over thousands of subjects.",1275352049

JPEG and the various MPEG standards for video already take advantage of this, by more heavily quantizing things that humans have trouble distinguishing changes in. Thus, while these compression schemes may increase the L2 reconstruction error, the results look ""better"" to human eyes than the results of PCA, where artifacts are quite noticeable.<p>If you do want to use PCA, then the following method is quite a bit more efficient than straight PCA on images:

Now my opinion: Whether or not somebody is fit for the job is not for the applicant to judge but for the employer. You cannot fake something in order to seem well-fit. For the same reason that a student, who feels she is capable of doing PhD level work, can't inflate her GPA. For the same reason that a student who feels she can make it through MIT can't add additional honors and awards to her MIT application. It is not about who can make it and do an OK job. For many positions, there are many more qualified applicants than slots. The faking of the credentials is extremely immoral and pretty much nullifies her worth to me. 
Human frailty, you say? More like human greed? It's not like she got caught faking credentials during her first year of employment. She was at MIT for 20 years. At some point she must have realized what she did was immoral. 20 years is more than enough time to quit the job, without a public spectacle, just giving a personal reason, and going into some other business without faked credentials (maybe her own business, like she does now). Money must have been too good to take the right path.

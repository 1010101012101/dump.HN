4800153,comment,4795139,4795784,2,0,lsc,,,">am I the only one immune to the this sort of thing?<p>Thing is, techniques that work great on one type of person will repulse another, so it's perfectly normal for a nerd to be completely immune to a sales pitch targeted at a neurotypical.  But that doesn't mean you can't be manipulated;  it just requires different techniques.  To believe otherwise is dangerous overconfidence.<p>>I'm actually kind of confused why this warrants a post-mortem given that I would hope that no one ever duplicates this sort of tactic in a legitimate business. Let the product sell itself, don't ""become the customer's friend"" in order to push it on them.<p>All co-location is sold this way.  As are commercial real-estate leases... and most residential leases, for that matter.  All of us, if we go into business, will have to buy products or services sold by those sorts of salesmen.  Knowing a bit about how their manipulation works is the first step towards self-defense.<p>I mean, it's not usually unsolicited... but if you want to lease some co-lo?  almost nobody except maybe some of the tiny nobodies list prices on the web page... and 90% of the time, those prices are not solid;  they are significantly higher than the 'special for you' price.<p>If you want to lease bandwidth?  same thing applies, only the difference between the first price you get and the 'special because you are my friend' price is larger.  I'm paying 1/5 the 'list price' for my large Cogent pipe.<p>So... it should be obvious why you need to study this stuff.  Well, obvious why I need to study this stuff;  I blow through north of a hundred grand on co-lo, bandwidth, and other related fees every year;  I'd bet money that I'm not within 20% of the lowest possible price, so yeah, it's worth quite a bit of effort to figure out how this bullshit works.<p>All that said, it is bullshit.  I avoid it whenever possible.  I build my own servers from parts, because you don't have to negotiate to get reasonable prices on parts, but you do have to negotiate to get reasonable prices on assembled servers.   The negotiation effort is far greater than the assembly effort.<p>Really, I think this is one of the primary reasons ""the cloud"" seems so much easier to deal with than co-location.  No negotiation, no dealing with the co-lo jacking up your rent every year.  (Yeah, just like a commercial or residential real-estate lease, every time your lease is up, the rent goes up in proportion to how difficult the landlord thinks it is for you to move.)<p>I've tried putting 'real prices' on my website for things like bandwidth and co-lo  (the bandwidth prices were really good, for the amounts I was offering.  The co-lo prices were reasonable but not unheard of.)  Almost no bites.  I did get salesmen calling me up all over the place;  for a 10% cut, they'd send me all kinds of customers.<p>So yeah... as far as I can tell?  this is just how some goods and services are sold.  As far as I can tell, the optimal move is usually to rearrange your life and your business so you buy as few of the products that require negotiation as possible;    But eh, depending on your sector, well, this may be impossible.  In that case?  yeah, learning sales bullshit and negotiation is important, if nothing else, to defend yourself against others.<p>I mean, I've negotiated a fair number of co-lo deals.  Probably more than your average person negotiates residential leases during their lifetime.   But the person at the other side of the table?  they are a professional.  They do this all day, every day.<p>So yeah.   Even now?  I do sometimes come away finding that the professional has manipulated me into doing something stupid.  For me?  key is to not agree to anything in person; take it home, show it to a (more conservative... my problem is that I optimistically buy more for a lower unit cost and end up not using most of it.) friend, sleep on it, and then decide.  I mean, I am in business and my conservative friends are not, I can't completely defer to them, but getting a perspective that is different from your own is super important, because sales manipulations that work on one type of person don't work on another.",1353223840

For example, who in the 90s would have guessed that something like TrustE would exist. It's not that far fetched to imagine that if government wasn't policing restaurants a private organization could exist to provide such a service. Yelp doesn't do that because it's not their mission and no one is going to make that their mission since the government already monopolized that job.<p>I'm not saying we should have 0 government either, but if we're not willing to question the necessity of things as trivial as local government health inspectors then where do we draw the line?",1353222547

4800117,comment,4799381,4799501,1,0,pedalpete,,,"I don't read the data like that. \nWhat's missing in that data is how many solo founders there are compared to non-solo.<p>I think you are assuming that their are an equal number of solo-founder companies as multi-founder companies, but I don't believe that is true. I wouldn't be surprised at all to find that 80+% of companies that are looking for funding are multi-founder. If that is the case, then the odds of getting funded as a solo-founder are equal to the odds of a multi-founder company.<p>However, we also need to consider how we qualify those companies which are likely to get funding or ready. Many solo-founder companies are not ready, but by the time they are ready, will possibly have added a co-founder.<p>Either way, the advice I think should be just to keep doing what you're doing. If YOU think you need a co-founder to be active in the company, you get one, if not, you don't. Investment shouldn't come as a result of that decision, unless investors are thinking that you can't do it without a co-founder, and they might be right.",1353222379

It probably has to be one of the most fun courses I took at uni. I didn't really learn much theory since most of the content is already covered in a standard algos course, which was one of the pre-req. But I think my programming and problem solving skills went up a notch. Our assignments were basically on solving problems from the UVA Online Judge[2]. We had two competitions for the mid-terms and finals. Each had an individual component and a team component that run on a custom grading server.<p>[1] <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/stevenhalim/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/stevenhalim/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://uva.onlinejudge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uva.onlinejudge.org/</a>",1353222281

4253120,comment,4252051,4252851,3,0,justinpeet,,,"More than anything else there needs to be an open source alternative to OneNote. Ironically, it's always been the least popular Office app and the most likely to be supplanted by an open source file format. Once tablets finally become mainstream I believe OneNote will be the most important in the Office suite. OneNote has the potential to replace paper; it'll be the default note taking app for students! It frustrates me no end that we don't yet have a digital replacement for a moleskin notebook. \n<a href=""http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2006/05/desperately-seeking-info-pad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2006/05/desperately-se...</a><p>(Google should have staked out a spot in this inchoate note scene when they introduced pen support in ICS, and Samsung launched the Galaxy Note, but stock Android doesn't even have a bundled Notes app much less something to compete with OneNote)",1342479567

4253114,comment,4252051,4252051,10,0,Avitas,,,"Since Office 97 was released, I haven't noticed any features that I use on a day-to-day basis that have changed or improved much. I'm sure many things have changed in some subtle way; it's just that I really don't see any difference in day-to-day usage. I know that the UNICODE support added in 2003 was a lot of non-trivial work.<p>I haven't noticed a single feature within Excel that has changed the way that I work.<p>In word, all of the mundane features every beginner uses also appear to be functionally identical. Other more involved items I use daily such as styles, outlining, headers and footers, footnotes, indexes, templates, merging and so forth also appear to be unchanged.<p>The biggest change I've noticed was with Powerpoint 2007. They added gobs of features and options that didn't exist before. But, I probably do 5 to 10 presentations a year, so it's not big win for me.<p>I would love to see greater stability in Word. Large and/or complex documents have been a weekly problem with all versions for Word for as long as I can remember. I haven't noticed much difference in stability since '97 as long as Word is hosted on an NT-based OS.<p>In the reporting of this new version, the announcement was made that this version is mostly interface changes and some add-on options.<p>Has anyone noticed a mention of any core functionality changes, re-writes, etc?",1342479379

4253105,comment,4252270,4253008,7,0,jbellis,,,"I appreciate the sentiment, but it's worth distinguishing between the design and implementation here.  Cassandra does take a lot of inspiration from the Bigtable and Dynamo papers, so we benefit from the thinking of a handful of very smart engineers at Google and Amazon, respectively, but the actual code is our [Apache's] own and for the battle testing you need to thank companies like Netflix, Reddit, Spotify, and others. [1]<p>That said, part of the reason Cassandra was attractive to me from the beginning is that unlike master-slave designs like MongoDB (or Bigtable/HBase, for that matter), a p2p design doesn't have the many corner cases around failover and recovery that complicate troubleshooting so badly.  This is a primary reason Cassandra has had a very good reliability story since very early on.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.datastax.com/cassandrausers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datastax.com/cassandrausers</a>",1342479266

4253098,comment,4252046,4252652,2,0,fjorder,,,"One of the big things I noticed in the first link there was that a SVG icon scaled to different sizes didn't look as good as a hand-optimised set of raster icons, largely due to issues that could conceivable be addressed.  e.g. When the SVG icon was scaled, the lines defining the shape also scaled up in thickness so that they appeared far too chunky in the largest version.  What if line-width were kept constant as the SVG was scaled?<p>While that link makes me appreciate that SVG speficially might be hard to work with and that simply scaling everything proportionally might not make for good icons across all sizes, I remain unconvinced that vector icons are hopeless.  Perhaps SVG's have the ability to do what I describe above, or perhaps we need a more powerful vector graphics format to work with.",1342479138

It bootstraps on existing toolchains a bit better(this can make a big difference for debugging), and it affords more flexibility in the build process in those situations where you really need to mix in code native to the target. The extra step of compilation to reach the runtime is treated as a UI issue. NME, for example, already has its own build system in order to deal with asset packaging, and it integrates the cpp target compilation alongside that.<p>This doesn't preclude the possibility of bytecode, but from the Haxe perspective it's seen as an optimization, not a must-have for practical use.",1342478995

4253085,comment,4251986,4252188,2,0,mamoswined,,,"> You're not going to make friends over one dinner. ... Friendship takes repeated exposure in mundane situations.<p>I made two friends at a GrubWithUs dinner. I think in today's climate you have to be so much more deliberate and calculating to have friends. You have to treat friendships the same way you treat online dating- meet as many people as possible and make plans with as many of them as you can. Which is really annoying, but otherwise I frankly would have no friends since I work from home and my colleagues are primarily older married men.<p>How I made these friends is I put cool people I met in my contact list and invited them to lots of things I already like to do on a regular basis. I also formed my own supper club that meets once or twice a month. Obviously it doesn't work out with everyone, but it worked out with two so far, which is great. As a woman who works in tech and has always had interests that are primarily shared with men, it has always been hard to me to make female friends, so I'm really grateful for anything that allows me to widen my net.<p>I would say a major obstacle to making friends for me is that at my age people are starting to couple and making their relationships their priority. I have a few friends whose significant others will not like them go anywhere unless they are also invited (and often these significant others are unpleasant people). It is sad to lose these friendships.",1342478839

If you want to make friends do something you hate or are horrible at.<p>The NYT article sited talked about 'getting over that hump' in a relationship.  Meeting people seemed like the easy part, but forming a friendship was the problem.<p>Ask them if they are afraid of something or cringe at the thought of doing something then organise the effort.<p>Know your limits and cooperate against them.  When failure is obvious everyone is free to have fun and avoid any anxiety to impress or succeed.<p>Example: I went indoor rock climbing with a friend.  It was his second time, and my first since I was ten.\nWe got to the gym, did a few easy tracks and then I suggested we go at the most difficult track on the wall.  We made it about ten feet up the wall then fell off.  Our hands were simply too weak.<p>We knew it was beyond us, but this was the first time all day that we laughed so for the rest of the day we just kept trying the same track.<p>We breaked for lunch and then argued whether we were too spent to go back for round two.  We decided to hell with the fatigue we have to beat that track.  We went back and, again, fell every time we tried.<p>The next day I saw him walking down the street so we got some coffee and laughed about how the both of us needed to find someone else to open doors and jars of peanut butter because our hands were so exhausted our grips had become useless.<p>There was very little `proper` socialising.\nImpossible to talk about anything except grip suggestions when one guys on the ground and the other is on the wall, but we got to know each other better, I think, than if we had talked about work or whatever.<p>Dinner is nice, but you want something you can look back on and say, 'Haha, do you remember when... that shit was ridiculous.'",1342478257

Larry Ellison?  The CEO of Hulu?  Mark Hurd?  Jerry Yang?  Tim Cook?<p>I think Mayer is better qualified than anyone else that is available because she is an expert on the space.  When she joined Google, the mainstream Internet was less than 5 years old.  Her entire career has been built on the Internet.  If she went to any large company like IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, Cisco, EMC, you name it, I would think it wouldn't be a good fit, because she wouldn't be an expert on the space.<p>Mayer has been with Google since practically the beginning, and as an executive, she has participated in the decisions and actions required to create and maintain a world-class engineering organization.  As well, being an early employee and not just surviving but <i>thriving</i>, I'd be willing to bet that Mayer has done more as an engineer than most engineers at Yahoo, except maybe Filo, so that gives her incredible technical legitimacy.  So, yes, I believe she is extremely qualified to run a company like Yahoo.<p>You can't just stick a ""turnaround expert"" in the shoes of Yahoo CEO and expect a great result.  You need someone that understands the space, and can make the tough and right decisions that can put Yahoo back on track.  Everyone that they've chosen as CEO since Yang just felt like they were trying to salvage as much of Yahoo as possible, and sell it to some other company or PE fund, and give up.  By choosing Mayer, it means they are serious about trying to put Yahoo back on the right path again, and not just selling it off.  I'm pretty sure this will motivate the current troops at Yahoo.<p>The only other interesting choice for CEO might be Reed Hastings, but he's taken already.  The Yahoo board could have elected to try to acquire Netflix and put Hastings as CEO of the combined company, which would have been interesting.  I still prefer the choice of Mayer though, because it shows a lot of guts, both on the part of Yahoo and Mayer.",1342476629

You can't expect one person to reinvent a company that does not have typical operations. By that I mean you can't improve processes or introduce vastly better products. Yahoo's only chance at growing is to expand into new product lines. That's why I don't necessarily think Mayer is a great match. I would be far more interested if a Tim Cook type had been chosen. Not because of the ties to Apple, but because of his expertise in operations and real business experience.",1342476020

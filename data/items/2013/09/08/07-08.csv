6348126,comment,6346478,6347358,1,0,tsironakos,,,"Hey, thanks for commenting. Lemme try to answer some of your questions.<p>> 3. Colours is the single most important thing of design<p>Colors are indeed the important aspect of design, but they&#x27;re also hard to choose and understand. In general, you have to know some things about colour theory when choosing a palette. I&#x27;d recommend to you to choose a popular palette from the sites I referred to in the article. Another option is to find a nice presentation and copy its palette. Speaker Deck is definitely your go-to choice for this.<p>>Just a tip here: not all palettes work well for a presentation. Firstly, some palettes have too much contrast.<p>Contrast is (simply put) the difference between two colors. It is often used to create vivid and colorful images, example: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/louisgely/4409863711/in/photostream/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/louisgely/4409863711/in/photost...</a>. That might work great for art and photography, but it&#x27;s not easy for our eyes. In fact, when you&#x27;re having a too contrasty palette it might look great on your computer but it will be difficult for viewers to read it comfortably. Also, consider that the projectors usually have different color profiles and not having enough contrast could become an even bigger problem. Generally you need a nice balanced palette eg. <a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/geeforr/whats-new-in-ruby-2-dot-0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/geeforr/whats-new-in-ruby-2-dot-0</a>. Finally, when you&#x27;re using only black and white in your palette, everything looks plain and emotionless, at least to me.<p>To conclude, colors are hard but there are ways to find good palettes around.<p>P.S.: I should edit my original post and clarify these things, add some examples as well.",1378626593

The author does make a passing reference to the real problems though:<p>1. Simulation is many orders of magnitude slower than the same code running in production (and you see code in production only after many months and dollars). You don&#x27;t face this slowdown when writing software.<p>2. Compared to software, there is much less code reuse in hardware. With software, it doesn&#x27;t cost much if your binary is 10% or even 100% bigger, so your class can be written a more general/reusable but less efficient way. But a 10% increase in the size of a chip makes it significantly more expensive, so as a hardware designer you tend to create one-off &#x27;classes&#x27; that are as efficient as possible, but less general/reusable.",1378626095

Basically if you consider kernel mode to run in ring 0 and user mode to run in ring 3, the Hypervisor runs in ring -1 and just deals with privileges to sum up. At to no instance does the hypervisor deal with the hardware such as disks or network cards. That code lies in the ring 0 kernel. All the Hypervisor says is ... &quot;yeah ok, ring -1 kernel, you can play in that sandbox&quot;.<p>For example when you run a VM, the VM emulates hardware but the OS running in the VM stills need drivers...<p>Now it&#x27;s not that easy to separate the OS from the drivers, because each OS has got some ideas about how the cache should work and how disks should be managed and what is actually a NIC.<p>When you write an OS you make your best so that writing a driver can be done to someone else and the code can be reused (e.g. for writing to multiple OS) but you CAN&#x27;T expect to use a common framework because well, at some point you will want to do DMA and you don&#x27;t want to tell your user that their Intel SSD will run at 10 MiB/s.",1378624914

(Caveat emptor: Choosing a bad prof will bring you nothing but pain!  Your supervisor is not just another prof.  He will have an insane impact on you!) B.Sc.&#x27;s are the Honda Civics of academia.  Universities mass produce them because they bring in the most cash per head.  Grad school is more like a bespoke roadster or F1 car. The resources universities spend on grad students and research are disproportionate compared to what they spend on undergrads.  Also, just as you learn more than just the core knowledge of your major in undergrad, you learn a lot of additional things in grad-school.  Teaching, speaking, etc..  Above all, grad students are placed under pressure to actually <i>think</i> instead of just regurgitating.  If you do another B.Sc. you&#x27;ll be repeating a lot of stuff you already know.<p>A good prof will figure out where your knowledge is lacking and give you the resources to catch up fast.  You&#x27;ll likely be thrown into some grad-level courses that are way outta your league and will have to work like a crazy bastard to catch up with students who have a CS B.Sc., but you&#x27;ll have great student-teacher ratios and your best teachers will actually be the other students.  You&#x27;ll probably have to TA material you&#x27;ll be learning the night before, and teaching something is a fantastic way to learn it well. Eventually, you should do some research, and hopefully you&#x27;ll have chosen a prof doing something you&#x27;re interested in.  Do NOT do a course-based M.Sc., as those are just upgraded Honda Civics!<p>You&#x27;ll be under intense pressure to learn a lot fast, but you&#x27;ll have the resources to do it.  A B.Sc. will likely take longer and you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time slacking off because undergrad courses are pretty damned easy.  Also, a M.Sc. is a better credential to have than another B.Sc..<p>When you&#x27;re choosing a prof, talk to the other grad-students.  DO NOT just choose the guy who was nominated for a nobel prize.

The density is very low because we use cheap hardware which fail regularly and such a small data amount means high recovery speed. 5TB is a soft limit and can be different for server groups, but it is not at the moment. Each group of 3 servers has a total capacity of 5TB because data is mirrored.<p>2) We have a centralised replicated metadata layer which is stored on the same servers as the data itself. All object chunks are stored at one servers group at the same time, so there is no need to connect to multiple servers to serve a file, it is enough to connect to one server from server group to get all the data. Metadata may be stored at different server group though.\nAll chunks are replicated to 3 servers at the same time using a sequential append-only log to ensure that all servers has the same data. This may introduce replication lag and if it is too big for some server then it is removed from the server group until replication lag back to normal (1-3 seconds usually).<p>Actually, it is much simpler than I explained, data layer with replication, data consistency and sharding is completely transparent to the application layer and it is really-really small and simple. Email me at support@s3for.me and I&#x27;ll share with you software details and you will understand how simple it is.",1378624053

6348062,comment,6346567,6346567,5,0,jorleif,,,"The article has an interesting argument structure. First it undermines the science behind psychiatric drugs by referring to their discovery as serendipitous. Then it proceeds to point out that there is no good theoretical understanding for how the drugs work, even if there is understanding in what neurotransmitter levels are effective. Then the author proceeds to drop the &quot;not better than placebo&quot; results.<p>Without knowing any psychiatric science, this narrative nevertheless seems suspicious. First of all, it is entirely irrelevant whether a discovery was made serendipitously or as a result of incremental science, as long as the effect is clear enough to be repeatedly found. This is not true in well understood fields, such as physics, where the theories are mostly not changed every now and then, but in complex fields, such as medicine and social sciences, the fact that something matches pre-existing theory is no evidence per se. The problem is &quot;bumpy&quot; enough that any theory is likely to flatten every bump that is not directly observed, even if that bump would be very useful in practice. This leads to most discoveries of any value being serendipitous. It also leads to incremental research failing to advance rapidly most of the time.<p>So the lack of theory and serendipitous discovery are not problems in themselves. The finding that psychiatric drugs would not be better than placebos is indeed a problem. It does raise the question, of how the serendipitous discovery was ever made. Did it arise out of spurious correlations, so that when the drug was first discovered there happened to be a big incidental recovery in most treated patients? Then in later retrials people managed to trigger a sufficient placebo effect to get the whole thing going. It does seem a little unlikely, but one would have to examine how the first trials were performed.",1378623761

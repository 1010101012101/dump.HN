There are other investors who browse the incoming firehose as well. If we think something is interesting / likely to be a good match, we email it to investors who follow those markets and locations. If the company gets interest, we broaden the send. Investors follow / take intros as they're interested. Keep in mind that 95%+ of businesses are not fundable by early-stage tech-focused Angels. AngelList is not a circular-reasoning walled garden. Most of the value that we bring investors is surfacing them deals outside of their social networks, and most of the value that we bring startups is finding them investors outside of their social networks. If we didn't do that, we would fail.<p>It's very much like a dating site. We can't let all of the guys contact all of the girls whenever and however they want.

Even GAAP is not designed to do that. It's a nuance of business valuation and ultimately in the case of a company like GroupOn the valuation is mostly due to what investors are willing to pay.<p>And yes, it's reasonable for a firm to choose one accounting approach over another b/c it makes the company easier to manage, or b/c it makes it easier to show the company's true strengths to the market (aka investors).",1316829072

In many cases the only people who pay to recoup the R&D costs of a new drug are Americans, while the rest of the world only pays the marginal costs of production.<p>P.S. For the drug companies this isn't a big problem because they still make back their development costs and there isn't much they can do when dealing with big state run health care systems. It's not fair but from a practical standpoint it still works. However, it does put the world's healthcare system at risk because people in the US are starting to think that drug companies are screwing them and they want the same deal the rest of the world has, they want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.

Governments exert themselves in a number of ways that amount to 'soft censorship', and it is often neither illegal nor very difficult to circumvent these measures. They just want to make it inconvenient, and create an appearance of distance/disapproval. Politics rewards such hypocrisy.<p>For example, content filters on government-workplace or government-accomodation internet access. They may not really care if you tunnel around them  it's rarely illegal  they just want to make sure there's no appearance they condone the activity.<p>Even things like the national internet blacklists can fall  into this category. They might require ISPs to block certain direct routes to disfavored sites, making access inconvenient. But the legal mandate is not to block all access via all means, and if you figure out how to access the target sites, you may not have broken any law (depending on what content you then copy/disseminate yourself).",1316826429

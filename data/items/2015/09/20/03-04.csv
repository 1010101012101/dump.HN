10246504,comment,10245673,10245673,0,0,jonhohle,,,"As a fan of immutable objects, I bemoan the builder pattern. The nice thing about constructors (or factory methods) is that you have a compile time guarantee that you have all required components to construct an object and validate its invariants. With a field oriented builder, only the documentation informs you whether you&#x27;ve met all of the conditions to construct an object. Also, a builder which mutates its own internal state breaks the idea of partial application where several variants can be constructed from a parent.<p>Unrelated to builders, the stream example could be simplified further with method references<p><pre><code>    final List<String> filtered = list.stream()\n        .filter(s -> s.startsWith(&quot;s&quot;))\n        .map(String::toUpperCase)\n        .collect(Collectors.toList());\n</code></pre>\nIt would be nice if Oracle back filled some predicates to make them more useful in streams (e.g. &quot;s&quot;::isPrefixOf, etc.).",1442720963

10246481,comment,10245673,10245673,0,0,mindcrime,,,"One thing I&#x27;d add, is that Java is very amenable to static code analysis, and there are good tools like PMD and FindBugs for Java.  I always encourage teams using Java to use one or both.  The biggest downside is that you usually have to tweak the rule-sets to avoid getting lots of false positives.  And if you get too many false positives then people tend to stop paying attention to the notifications from the tool.<p>On a related note, I really encourage Java teams to shoot for a goal of having compiles that finish with no warnings.  If there are generic warnings littering your code (like, for example, all the warnings about unqualified references to generic types that you get when using code written before generics existed), bite the bullet and either fix them, or make it explicit that you don&#x27;t care and add the appropriate annotations to turn them off.  At least that way, when a new, interesting warning shows up, maybe people will pay attention to it.<p>And yes, this is something of a &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot; thing, as I have definitely written Java code that doesn&#x27;t follow this rule.  Especially on my personal projects or code where I&#x27;m not working with a big team.  On bigger projects, I do try to push that as much as I can, depending on my role on the project.",1442719992

In some patients we saw no benefit at all. In others the results were near miraculous. For example, in the span of 2 weeks (the length of the program) one 4 year old child who had never spoken went from zero to 50 words. His mother was in tears.<p>The people who developed the program in Colorado had numerous pieces of coverage, Wired even did an 8 part story on them but couldn&#x27;t ever get an autism study together. Eventually they did manage to get a complete study through regarding PTSD because you could get a control group together for PTSD and it showed statistically significant changes (part of the program affects the amygdala and there was some crossover benefit).<p>The whole thing was both fascinating and shocking. When I found out about the program at first, I was an absolute skeptic too. Looks completely hokey, but for SOME people it works.<p>The problem is that they haven&#x27;t been able to find a way to identify the type of people who will benefit significantly...and that is because of the difficulties of getting together a control group. I know there is one doctor in Indiana trying to classify the symptom patterns across the spectrum. He&#x27;s worked hard to reduce them down...to about 4,000. Prior to the categorization and reduction he was sitting at closer to 200,000.<p>And the problem is that the second that you know that and you start reading headlines about a study &quot;disproving X&quot; regarding autism you click the link and realize that 9/10 times it&#x27;s just a rehashed study on general public diagnostics...because nobody can get together a friggin control group.",1442719531

This sort of shuffling is pretty standard for RISC ISAs, where it&#x27;s typical to have fixed-length instructions that are no larger than the registers.<p>For example, MIPS has no actual &quot;load immediate&quot; instruction. Instead, say you want to load the value 0x12345678 into register t0. You can go ahead and tell your MIPS assembler:<p><pre><code>    li $t0, 0x12345678\n</code></pre>\nbut it will actually emit something like:<p><pre><code>    lui $t0, 0x1234\n    ori $t0, $t0, 0x5678\n</code></pre>\n&quot;lui&quot; here is the &quot;load upper immediate&quot; instruction, which loads the target register with the 16-bit immediate, left-shifted by 16 bits. &quot;ori $t0, t0, 0x5678&quot; then performs a bitwise OR with its immediate to get the lower 16 bits into the register. This can be done in a single instruction if the immediate is 16 bits or smaller by using the dedicated zero register (a read-only register that always contains 0x00000000, which turns out to be extremely handy for minimizing an instruction set):<p><pre><code>    ori $t0, $zero 0xabcd</code></pre>",1442719232

But to be able to support on an article basis sounds great.<p>Some raw numbers, if we read 15000 articles per year ( I read/skim a maximum of 50 per day) then it&#x27;s not a bad thing to say 150 USD per year or 1 cent per article read. Maybe that&#x27;s too much. But I was spending about 70 USD per year for subscribing to 3 publications that I gradually started reading less of. So a 150 USD to read my normal fill where I pay both to support the writer, and not have myself tracked sounds great.<p>I bet I&#x27;ll even make it back in bandwith saved :D",1442718766

But they&#x27;re simply not. Having logic in getters/setters is the only justification for this added bloat. In my experience, in the overwhelming majority of cases (never say all) having logic in getters and setters is a clear indication that your design is flawed anyway, so most of the time you should never have them.<p>On this part:<p>> Further, this class is immutable unless you extend it, so we can reason about it easier as we know that it can&#x27;t be changed.<p>Well, I&#x27;d go further. Make the class final if you really want to guard against people extending it. Of course this is most applicable for writing reusable libraries where communication with consumers may be limited.<p>If you rely on language features to enforce development practices in a team who can freely communicate, in general you&#x27;ve got a much bigger problems than the few rare bugs that extending an immutable class and making it mutable will cause.<p>Obviously though, putting guard rails in can only ever be helpful, even when absolutely everyone understands that there&#x27;s a cliff edge there, and wouldn&#x27;t conciously try to walk over it anyway.",1442718496

I have a huge amount of books (mostly technical) that I enjoy reading, and I spend probably 100 -> 200$ USD / month on new books. Most of the books I read are O'Reilly, Apress, Pragmatic Programmers, and a lot of the other big tech publishers.<p>My question is--should I buy the new kindle? I've always been interested in it, but I have an attachment to my book collection, and worry that I won't be able to find as wide a selection of ebooks for download, or that the device won't be as pleasurable to read as a real book.<p>From a logical standpoint, having a kindle would help me save some money, reduce clutter around my house (I have a <i>lot</i> of books), and be far more convenient to reference old information (via searching a book on the kindle vs. flipping through pages).<p>Do any of you own a kindle? Do you find that it is pleasurable to read from?

I'm the main developer, and we'll have 1-2 more guys full time.  I've 5+ years in this, and we're not building anything that is too complex.  The other guys all have 100% confidence in my abilities, and don't doubt that I can do the work and manage the other coders as well.<p>However, my president has said he'd like for me to have a senior level advisor for the coding and architecture.  Specifically, he wants a person who has done it all, so I can ask questions if needed.<p>I've explained that 1) developers generally don't work for free (we've gotten great business advisors like that, but I don't think that's generally how the dev world operates) and 2) between HN, SO, and a few other communities, I've got a ton of resources for questions.<p>His response: ""if Paul Graham were willing to talk architecture with you, would you do it?""  Of course I would.  But that doesn't seem to be a realistic option.<p>Do any of you guys have advice on looking for an advisor?  The kinds of questions I'd like to chat (with someone who has done this in a startup, successfully) are things like:
- what kind of problems were you initially unaware you'd face? (What do you not know, that you're unaware you don't know?)
- what are some tips for managing a small in-house team and a larger external outsourced team?<p>Thanks for any advice you guys have.  I know (and importantly, my team knows) that I am capable of this, but they still want the official ""development advisor"" person.<p>Also, we'll probably be hiring in a few months, so keep an eye out for a posting regarding that coming here soon.",1278010544

1478868,comment,1478035,1478808,0,0,_pi,,,"Labor laws in the US clearly state that if the person is working unpaid the company cannot receive any immediate benefits for his or her position. This means that you can't have the person ""hands on learning"" while working on your product or working at a client site. That is purely illegal unless they're doing it for course credit. Again if you take on a college student but they cannot get course credit, however even if their university offers it and you derive immediate benefit from their employment it's illegal.<p>I understand if someone cold cases you for an internship and you cannot pay them but they want to learn and have some position in your company it's a bit more acceptable. But essentially if you send out job postings for interns you support a systematic evil in the job market of the US. These people have no choice but to work for you if they want to work in their field, and obviously no choice but to do so for free. You essentially try to write it off by saying it gives them value or experience but you as an employer are more interested in the free labor rather than what they derive out of it. There is no way around that. You aren't hiring them for their sake, you're hiring them because you get free labor that they are excited to do, and that's the best deal for you because you get the profit from it.<p>This hurts what people value their career at a critical juncture when they enter the job market. They see that everyone has to take unpaid internships meaning that companies aren't willing to value their work, this gets them thinking that their work is valueless. Which in turn is worse for any employer because the performance of the employee would suffer because of this diffusion of responsibility.<p>In short posted unpaid internships hurt the job market, hurt companies and most importantly hurt workers in their most critical time. Not only that but you seem to relish the opportunity of a person who is super excited to work on something for you for free, which is disrespectful of anyone you hire. I'm not against all unpaid internships, but most people see it as free labor, not altruistically training new employees for the job market. Even this article is prefaced with ""Yay free labor in the summer!"" which is what triggered my response, specifically this line: ""I’m talking about internships - free, grunt work labor in the hopes of making connections and gaining a little bit of experience along the way.""",1278010257

I am the kind of person who needs some sort of competitive hobby and I having a hard time finding one.]<p>So I too did Counter-Strike and WC3. When I was in college, my friend and I ran a website called thewac.net (kinda dead now, don't bother going there), and it was associated with our custom counter-strike servers with a zombie mod. That taught me alot about programming and community. 
I moved on to create a DC++ Hub on the college network and that taught me more about systems administration, data/user management, social community, etc. etc. 
Then I graduated.<p>I've been working at my new job for almost a year, and my coworker has like 20 years under his belt in experience, and I've learned more from him about programming and technology in less then a year, than I did in 5 years of college. He's also a gamer, so we also discussing gaming as well. (Currently Bad Company 2). 
If you want to keep at programming, I highly suggest you jump into the Unreal Tournament 3 engine or the Source engine (Valve) and try programming for a game.<p>That said, if you want something competitive, I recently took up hiking in the Adirondacks, and I've decided I want to do all the summits of the ADK's and the Catskill's here in New York State. The amount of punishment it is on your body is brutal to me, and yet liberating.You compete against yourself.  
Your other options are to look for local sporting leagues to join, or pick a hobby for competition.<p>Look at yourself and think of what you want to improve and then ask ""What can I do to improve that part of me?""<p>For me, it was my physical shape, and my lack of adventure. Hence, hiking in the largest state park in the United States, and picking Mt. Marcy for my first hike. Eventually I'll move to Colorado and do the rockies.<p>I hope that helps.",1278010093

I don't have an iPhone, I have a Motorola handset.  My Motorola will make calls when the iPhones can't get any signal.  The whole family has to use my phone when we go to remote areas.  Furthermore, my AT&T/Motorola combination outperforms the <i>same model phone</i> on Verizon in the marinas on the Northeast coast (Boston - Baltimore) and in the mountains of W VA and Western Maryland.  These are the only places I've been able to do direct comparisons, but I've <i>never</i> been in a situation where some other service had better coverage than AT&T (that is, I've never had to borrow someone else's phone on a different network to make a call).<p>The reason I haven't bought an Android is that I don't want to give up AT&T service.  Not a fanboi at all; in fact, I've been pissed at them in the past.  But in my observation they are superior, at least in the regions I haunt.<p>I understand the transceiver sensitivity of the iPhone 4 is finally quite good, and I was/am looking forward to maybe getting one.  But until now, it has never impressed me as a <i>phone</i>, which is what I mainly need it for (it's my primary business line and I won't take a chance on inferior coverage).",1278008361

1478740,comment,1478124,1478124,0,0,grellas,,,"The sources of law are as varied as the institutions in place for promulgating them. Some derive from charter documents such as constitutions and are foundational to the society; others from judges deciding cases and setting precedents that in turn affect future decisions; still others from the statutory enactments of legislators who (at least in theory) are directly accountable to voters and which enactments consist of laws aimed at dealing with broad categories of problems and issues concerning the whole society, such as tax systems, regulatory systems affecting commerce, and the like; still others derive from regulatory bodies set up under the various statutory schemes and charged with promulgating and sometimes enforcing detailed regulations under the authorizing statutes, as for example detailed tax regulations covering fine points of what does or does not qualify for a particular deduction or helping to interpret the meaning of otherwise broad language in a statute; still others come from local sources having nothing to do with a national government, such as state governments, local municipalities and the like; still others from international sources such as treaties adopted by a national government; and still others from direct popular sources such as systems authorized by state constitutions by which citizens can place initiatives on a ballot for a popular vote (this breakdown refers to U.S. law but applies generally to any form of Western-based system of modern constitutional government, such as that in the U.K.).<p>Virtually all these sources of law are what might be called ""top down"" - that is, once the mechanisms have been set up in a society that enable citizens to have some form of say in how a government is constituted and how its laws are enacted, the institutions take over and generate the laws going forward, whether through legislators, judges, or regulators, and average people basically get stuck with the results, having only limited recourse to do anything about any of this directly except for the occasional vote at the ballot box, participation in political campaigns, and the exercise of speech rights aimed at influencing the political process.<p>Given this top-down nature of law (in general), a site such as this will inherently have only limited value at best. The idea is to have politicians be more connected with the citizenry and less ""out of touch"" by being able to hear what ails average people and what they want changed. That is fine in itself but, presumably, the ability of an average citizen to sound off generally is already pretty substantial and especially in our modern age where blogs and the like have substantially enhanced that ability. With social media, many of the ideas coming from the citizenry can also take on a viral impetus, magnifying their impact. And, thus, it should be no secret to politicians what the big issues of the day generally are insofar as average people are reacting to them. This sort of site, one would guess, would do little to add anything meaningful to the knowledge base that politicians already possess of what within the law agitates people and calls for some form of change.<p>This sort of site might serve as a filtering mechanism by which the popular pulse might be better measured than from a random sampling of popular opinion but how is this any better than, say, a poll commissioned to sound out opinion on any given issue (even assuming that the input can be meaningfully organized so that it is not just random input from who knows what source)? If the site gets countless complaints about a particularly oppressive law from civil libertarians that business interests might support, or about overweening regulations that businesses hate but civil libertarians support, what does that add to the mix that is in any way meaningful? And how would this serve to influence politicians who already have their own philosophy about such issues, one way or the other? Do they listen to their boosters or to their detractors? If to the detractors, how will this have an impact if the site is not designed to afford any opportunity to make meaningful arguments that might persuade? Even if it could serve to sway politicians in some way, how would this affect the 90%+ of the laws that they don’t directly control (e.g., judge-made laws, constitutional laws, bureaucratic regulations)?<p>I have no problem with participatory democracy and do believe that making government more accessible to its citizens is a good thing. No one wants ""top-down"" rule in any absolutist sense of tyranny and, in a free society, the more accountable the politicians are to those who elect them the better.<p>But, given the realities of modern political institutions, the practical effect of such a site would seem to be negligible except that it gives the politicians promoting it an <i>appearance</i> of wanting to reach out and be responsive to average people. This in itself might have value but far more for the politicians involved than for the citizens affected by their actions.<p>I hope this doesn't sound cynical but, viewed with a professional eye (i.e., as one who deals with law in many forms), the impact of this site as structured on the law itself is very likely to be nil.  Maybe with a different approach the idea could be better implemented. As is, though, I would call it more a stunt than anything else. Of course, I am not directly familiar with the political realities of the U.K. and may be off on this - from a distance, that is how I would assess it.",1278007632

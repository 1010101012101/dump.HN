6356548,comment,6355738,6356378,6,0,breckinloggins,,,"I agree.  In my opinion the whole notion of a baked-in &quot;type system&quot; is silly.  Type systems themselves aren&#x27;t silly, but including one in the language proper seems to be stopping at the wrong abstraction.<p>Let&#x27;s say we see:<p><pre><code>    int add_two(int a, int b)\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re so used to seeing those &quot;ints&quot; as types, but why?  There&#x27;s a better abstraction here, mainly one of:<p><pre><code>    ensure_conforms_to(int) add_two(ensure_conforms_to(int, a), ensure_conforms_to(int, b))\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not arguing for that horrific syntax, I&#x27;m saying that type systems are just another part of your program running at a separate time.  There&#x27;s a LOT more you can do with that concept than just enforcing and deducing the tags and acceptable conversions that go with values.  Contracts, powerful dispatch mechanisms, ad-hoc optimization strategies, complex lambda cube stuff like dependent types... all of these things can be served with the right abstraction.<p>And there is no reason that your editors, documentation browsers, code completion engines, syntax highlighters, debuggers, and every other part of your environment can&#x27;t use it!<p>Shen seems to get that.",1378763902

6356464,comment,6355936,6356272,18,0,btilly,,,"The problem is that most money in circulation was manufactured by creating debt.  When you destroy that debt through default, you destroy that money.<p>The fiction of student loans is tricky because under Bush they changed bankruptcy rules to exclude student debt.  But fundamentally when banks are forced to write down bad student debt, their rosy asset picture becomes non-rosy.  When that happens they are required by regulators to not lend.  And this is ugly for the whole economy.<p>In 2008 we resolved the problem by having the US government find ways to lend tremendous amounts of money on very favorable terms, and then the Fed picked this up with a similar policy that they call quantitative easing.  This creates lots of money in financial markets so that things like banks can continue to operate.  The bigger long-term problem is how we&#x27;ll ever exit the policy.<p>To give an idea how sensitive this situation is, a while ago Bernanke announced that if things continued to improve faster than expected, in a year the Fed would evaluate whether to exit QE 2 faster than originally planned.  You can&#x27;t come up with a milder statement that the policy might end.  The markets went crazy.  A few days later, Bernanke came out and said we won&#x27;t be doing that after all, then markets calmed down.<p>There is no question, a student loan debt crisis will be responded to with more QE.  The problem of exiting the mess will become bigger.  Historically countries have exited this type of policy only after the crisis of a currency collapse.  But so far the market players seem to be betting that they will get out of the USA before the other guy when the crisis hits, and in the meantime the USA looks safer than China and Europe.<p>However the financial economy is always a mess.  And they are always finding another way to kick the can down the road.  That will certainly happen again.  And again.  And again.  Until it doesn&#x27;t.  Every time the doomsayers say, &quot;We don&#x27;t see how we can kick the can down the road again!&quot;  But we do.  The dot com bust was resolved with easy interest policies that resulted in a housing boom that resulted in the financial crisis.

Everyone in the company dials in each morning and sits online while they&#x27;re working. Of course, you can drop out, or you could set yourself to busy. But the crux of it is this, instead of a list of callers, you could lay out a digital office complete with walls and doors where you can sequester yourself or a handful of employees for a meeting. And the volume of a person would be relative to how close you are to them in the &quot;digital&quot; office (I know, I know, Skype&#x27;s volume management wouldn&#x27;t suffice for this project).<p>Again, the technical aspects are beyond my abilities, but I imagine you could let the lines run really cold while there isn&#x27;t a lot of communication so you&#x27;re not chewing up bandwidth. If you&#x27;re closed in an office, it could really just close your VoiP connection and poll the server as to the state of your door and dial you back in when it opens.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s a start.",1378762739

The only thing they truly care about is that the papers they publish get cited. This means highly original work, which frequently doesn&#x27;t get cited much for a long time, is less desirable than a turn-the-crank paper from a respected name.<p>Researchers have been taught to prize Nature publications (thanks to the same flawed metric of merit) and spend a disproportionate amount of time submitting papers to Nature. When you write a paper you choose your target journal, and writing for Nature means you need to avoid rocking the boat too much, because they receive so many submissions that one minor criticism from a referee will torpedo your paper, even if that criticism is demonstrably wrong. Sometimes invalid criticisms are made by referees who are jealous, threatened, or merely lazy, but the editor has so many other submissions to deal with that he/she won&#x27;t take the time to evaluate and understand the referee recommendations. Real science invites debate, but Nature&#x27;s editors run screaming from it.<p>Why do researchers care so much about playing this game if it compromises their writing and even their research? Even a tenured prof needs to hustle for funding if he wants to do more than teach and sit in his office. PI&#x27;s are salesmen even more than they&#x27;re managers! The very language itself is twisted at the core when applying for grants. The average researcher or project must be superlative in every way on paper or no money is going to come. You can&#x27;t say you&#x27;re doing something out of pure curiosity and the chances of it spawning another silicon valley are remote. It has to be imminently commercializable with potential for massive, revolutionary impact! Honesty will destroy you. If every research proposal delivered what it promised the World would be one giant Palo Alto. We would all be better off if some better way to allocate resources were found, but that&#x27;s no easy task!<p>As for the PhD student... There is more than meets the eye here. You don&#x27;t walk away from 4 years of work in the last month without reason. Perhaps his thesis is a hopeless mess. Perhaps his relationship with his supervisor is hostile. Perhaps he&#x27;s mentally ill. The last few months are ridiculously stressful after all! It&#x27;s also very possible he or she is a lot more than one month from finishing. Hopefully there are people who care about this person and will help him/her get back on track and finish.

I know that the prosecution declined to seek the death penalty. And that the trial did not begin with the required paperwork to do so.<p>>This goes back to what I was saying about advocates being near to dishonesty, by the way. You probably read at some point Manning was facing the death penalty, and despite having years and years to correct your initial misperception, you continue to not only remember that incorrectly, but to parrot it as truth.<p>The prosecution declined to seek the death penalty. Instead, they ultimately asked for 60 years. Now, the distinction between being lethally injected and left to rot for 60 years is minimal in my mind (and the injection seems almost preferable), but there&#x27;s nothing dishonest or near dishonest about the fact that Manning faced the death penalty. It was the (surely merciful) prosecution that had the choice and declined to fill out the necessary paper work. Every day prior to their decision to merely seek an effectively life-long prison sentence, rather than an immediate execution, was a day Manning spent uncertain even of whether he would be executed or not, much less whether he&#x27;d spend the remainder of his life in a six by eight foot cage.<p>I am not remembering anything incorrectly. I&#x27;m merely refusing to let misconceptions spawned from paralegal pedantry trump justice.<p>>When Barrett pasted that link, was that information already publically available?<p>Yes. The entire debacle was already blowing up between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day on 2011. Stratfor itself was aware of the problem on Christmas Eve and alerting its subscriber base to the breach and what they were doing about it. Dozens of people were reporting about this &quot;on or about December 25 2011&quot; as the indictment describes, when it lists &quot;<a href=""http://wikisend.com/download/597646/stratfor_full_b.txt.gz&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikisend.com/download/597646/stratfor_full_b.txt.gz&quot;</a> as the link that got Brown in trouble when he copy-pasted it from #AnonOps to #projectpm and in so doing, in the eyes of the indictment, became guilty of aiding and abetting in charges relating to &quot;Traffic in Stolen Authentication Features,&quot; &quot;Access Device Fraud,&quot; and &quot;Aggravated Indentity Theft.&quot; (indictment: <a href=""http://freebarrettbrown.org/files/bb_indictment2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freebarrettbrown.org/files/bb_indictment2.pdf</a>).

The standard is not whether it&#x27;s &quot;news&quot; to whoever is listening, be they readers of a newspaper or users in an IRC channel. That&#x27;s like saying that I&#x27;m aiding and abetting Snowden&#x27;s release of the NSA files because, before Snowden, Greenwald, Poitras et alia released the materials, I was unaware of their existence.<p>>But either way involvement in criminal enterprises has always been itself a crime, to avoid diversion of responsibility in the way you would allow.<p>There is no &quot;diversion of responsibility&quot; taking place here. Those responsible for the initial hack into stratfor have already been tried and convicted. Hammond was also involved in utilizing the credit card data to lodge donations to various entities, along with other &quot;co-conspirators&quot; that the FBI presumably has yet to identify. And are we also forgetting that the FBI was complicit in this whole charade with Stratfor? Sabu was already their man at this point, and when Hammond approached Sabu about vulnerabilities in Stratfor&#x27;s infrastructure, the FBI set up their own servers with which to store the information that was to be exfiltrated! Hell, according to the FBI&#x27;s own press release, <i>Hammond and Co.</i> were responsible for the initial leak of information:<p>&quot;HAMMOND and his co-conspirators also publicly disclosed some of the confidential information they had stolen.&quot;<p>(press release: <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2012/six-hackers-in-the-united-states-and-abroad-charged-for-crimes-affecting-over-one-million-victims"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2012/six-hackers-i...</a>)<p>Is Brown to be considered a co-conspirator for talking about something that dozens if not hundreds or even thousands of others were also talking about at the same time? The indictment&#x27;s line of reasoning swallows itself whole: who&#x27;s going to indict those responsible for listing the link in the indictment? Or those who link to the indictment? Or host it? Is anyone going to go after the FBI for knowingly and willingly permitting the breach and release of materials belonging to a protected corporation of the United States that thereby caused undue economic distress to said corporation?",1378762474

6356369,comment,6355936,6355936,46,0,everettForth,,,"No, it&#x27;s not. Not even close, and this is really terrible reporting. It&#x27;s unfortunate that so many young people are carrying large amounts of student loan debt, but there is no sign of a &quot;bubble&quot; bursting any time soon. I don&#x27;t even understand how the notion of a &quot;student loan bubble&quot; makes sense, since people don&#x27;t &quot;speculate&quot; on college like they speculate on real estate.<p>There are so many things wrong with the idea of a &quot;bubble&quot; popping. People can&#x27;t walk away from student loan debt, like they can walk away from real estate debt. Interest rates are expected to rise, but only slightly with the 90-day T-bill yield. Not the insane rates 20% rates that banks were hitting people with in the subprime crisis.<p>People may find diminishing returns for college vs the rising costs, but that isn&#x27;t the same thing as banks suckering people in with ARMs and then using leverage to make huge speculations on CDO&#x27;s that lost 90% of their value.<p>Here&#x27;s a madeup example from the subprime crisis. Someone puts $0 down and buys a $500k home with a loan from the bank. The bank expects to make $500k in interest over the lifetime of the loan due to ballooning interest. Now, let&#x27;s say variable interest rates from the loan kicks in, and the person can no longer make his monthly payments.<p>In the past, when the real estate market was good, he could just sell the house for $600k, and keep a profit. But, lets say now the price of the home dropped to $300k. There is no way you are going to expect someone who put $0 down on a home he bought 2 years ago to cover $200k in debt for a home he doesn&#x27;t even own any more due to foreclosure. So, now, instead of having something worth $500k in profit, the bank owns something that is a $200k loss.<p>Banks lost over a trillion dollars worth of assets in a matter of weeks.<p>Look at what was happening for years before the crisis though. In those times, it was very likely that a home could increase in value from $500k to $600k in a few years. How was that happening? A lot of it was because people figured out that they could put $10k down, and do this to make $100k, or 10x their investment in a few years. The true speculators are the people who just bought real estate only because they thought the price would keep going up. This in turn drives up the price without being tied to any kind of intrinsic value.<p>You simply don&#x27;t have that kind of pure speculation in the college loan industry because you can&#x27;t just buy and sell college degrees.<p>Also, people aren&#x27;t just going to declare bankruptcy from their student loans in the same way as the subprime crisis because they legally can&#x27;t. Wages can be garnished from student loans, and it&#x27;s extremely hard to have the debt erased due to bankruptcy.<p>The &quot;bubble&quot; scenario is sensational, because everyone sees a trillion dollars evaporate in a few weeks. Instead, in the case of student loans, I think that we may see something just as bad for the economy, but it will happen over years, not weeks.<p>In a lot of ways, I think that&#x27;s why this problem may be worse, because it may be just as bad, but much harder to notice than the subprime crisis. Journalists think that the only sign of economic failure is when a &quot;bubble&quot; pops though, which just isn&#x27;t true. Slowed growth over 20 years could be just as bad if not worse.",1378762228
6356368,comment,6355936,6355936,65,0,msandford,,,"It&#x27;s really too bad that the laws surrounding student loans make them artificially cheap.  You can&#x27;t get rid of college debt through bankruptcy so you&#x27;re basically saddled for life.<p>Normally the interest you pay is the combination of three things:<p>1.  The (inherent) time value of money<p>2.  Expenses the lender incurs to keep up with the debt<p>3.  The average default risk of those taking the loans<p>Student loans only price in 1 & 2 because of the near impossibility of not paying the loans back.  Which is great in the short term as it means that more people are able to go to school because the interest rate is lower and thus they can afford more debt.<p>But a college education is a lot like a house.  The price of a house isn&#x27;t how much it&#x27;s &quot;worth&quot;, it&#x27;s an artifact of how much money you have to pay every month for the privilege of living there. A house of a certain niceness is (everything else equal) going to cost the same amount of money per month whether the interest rate is 1% or 15%.  A $1500/mo mortgage buys you $250k of house at 4% but only $150k of house at 9% and only $95k of house at 15% like in the early 80s. (<a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/history-of-mortgage-interest-rates.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/history-of-mortgag...</a>)<p>By removing all the default risk from the pricing of student loans, more students are able to afford college which is exactly the intended effect of the laws.  But the size of most academic institutions doesn&#x27;t grow; most colleges don&#x27;t admit twice as many students just because more are clamoring to get in.  This excess demand and fixed supply means that colleges can raise prices.  And thanks to the lowered interest rates those who could have afforded college prior to the law (and lower interest rates) are still able to afford it because the lowered interest rate has increased their borrowing capacity.<p>Those on the margin prior to the change in the law still aren&#x27;t able to afford college once the price increases follow the increase in available money and additional demand for degrees.<p>The law was changed in 1978 and it&#x27;s taken quite a few years for this unintended consequence to play out.  It&#x27;s really sad to see it happen.  <a href=""http://www.finaid.org/questions/bankruptcyexception.phtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.finaid.org/questions/bankruptcyexception.phtml</a>",1378762224

You have to go to Moscow.<p>Q: The story is made up, because emabassy in Belarus is not issuing visas.<p>A: Right. That&#x27;s why if your parents live in Belarus, you have to go to another country, like Russia, to have an interview and then stay about a week in a hotel, waiting for your passport. You can&#x27;t go back to Belarus, because they keep your passport at the embassy and not giving it back to you right away, even if you passed interview and your visa was granted.<p>Q: Why did you apply for a new visa if your previous was issued only 2 months ago?<p>A: Both L1 and L2 visas are linked to your blanket petition. Petition is another document, issued by USCIS for 1 year. You can&#x27;t get a visa, which expiration date is longer than your petition expiration date. My petition was approved in August 2012, but I received it in fact only in spring (after more than 6 months).

6356283,comment,6355579,6356058,2,0,gajomi,,,"This is a very good point and I think I would like to refine my comment in response to it.<p>I think it is important to distinguish between individual vs collective accountability, as well as accountability within a field and the accountability of the field to larger society. My argument for supporting basic research in a field assumes that there is internal accountability within that field and that the research makes sense to those within it even if there is no direct application. In this view accountability of the individual to society is mediated by the accountability of the field at large to society. This is what allows for various sorts of bet hedging (if we think of a field as a firm) to improve the chances of hitting the rare event where a basic result has a big impact. If there is a deterioration of transparency accountability within a field, perhaps due to the mechanisms the OP describes in points (1-7) then (8) does become a problem. So I have perhaps a different understanding of (8) then the OP. I do not argue that some particular flavor of esoteric mathematics be supported because &#x27;it will be useful someday&#x27;. Rather I argue that, so long as there is intellectual integrity within mathematics (or whatever other field) that one should expect some small fraction of the esoteric theoretical research will yield big returns, and that these returns will subsidize the failed efforts. This kind of mechanism allows for the possibility to support t=infinity timescale research with accountability checks of the collective at finite timescales.<p>Now, if we start to deviate from my assumption of integrity within a field and my scenario of field as idealized firms, there are all sort of interesting game theoretical questions that pop up. For example, what sort of internal rewards and punishments within a field are needed to keep things honest? I don&#x27;t know, but I think it is interesting to think about.",1378761551

It wasn&#x27;t too long ago that many young people also harbored an idealism about working for big companies: go to college, get a nearly guaranteed job at a corporation, work there for 25-30 years, retire with a pension. But we all know that each of these steps is less guaranteed today than it was for the previous generation, sometimes significantly so. It&#x27;s the same for academia.<p>As we cram more and more people into the same cities, the same companies, the same institutions of learning, they&#x27;re going to experience some failures to scale. This is one of those failures. Academia becomes hyper-competitive. There aren&#x27;t enough jobs. School becomes too expensive. Home prices outpace inflation and wage increases by a factor of three or more. The world is just much more competitive today, and it will continue to become even more competitive.<p>I sometimes think about my grandfather, now dead, who was a sales executive for a major clothing company in the 60s and 70s.

We&#x27;re not doing completely custom clothing eg. an all together different pattern - we&#x27;ll do it, as a service if none of our sizes fit, but I think that is pretty unlikely.<p>What we&#x27;ve done is taken the most overlooked body types - tall and thin, extremely athletic (body builders etc.), and heavier-set guys that want nice shirts, and built sizes that look good on them.<p>That said, I DO genuinely think that our medium shirt (the size I wear) fits better than any medium I&#x27;ve tried before. We&#x27;ve had a TON of feedback to confirm this.<p>Great advice on the checkout forwarding. Will definitely make that change soon!",1378760806

There seems to be some confusion about this visualization, but we can solve it with just two words: Start Clicking!<p>The thing that makes this visualization different than other visualizations is that you can see the individual components of what makes up the large departments. Just double click on any of the boxes. If you single click on any box, you can see how that box changed over time.<p>So, for example, you can see that in 2012 that 2.89% of the budget went to education, but if you double click, you can see that only 13.73% of that went to elementary and secondary education.<p>You can also single click anywhere and see a graph of how things have changed over time. So you can see that in 2009 there was a huge spike in elementary and secondary education, and you can go to 2009 to further investigate, and find there was a &quot;State Fiscal Stabilization Fund&quot; in 2009 that sent $14 billion to education, and then went away.<p>As many have noted, this doesn&#x27;t do a good job at comparing different departments to each other over time. This isn&#x27;t a surprise, since a treemap is the completely wrong format to be able to do that. However, it is a very good format for exploring what agencies, bureaus and line items make up the large departments, which is data I&#x27;ve never seen anywhere else before, and why I built this visualization.",1378760533

It&#x27;s possible to learn new skills, etc., outside a job. Some people are overflowing with ideas for projects and some also have the willpower to put their own nose to the grindstone to get them done and ship, so don&#x27;t need a job to accomplish things. They might only need a job to earn money, especially have a steady paycheck to expect regularly. The opposite of &quot;having a job&quot; is not &quot;doing nothing&quot; or &quot;rotting away&quot; or &quot;being a parasite&quot;, etc. Also, some people are just happier with a less externally structured daily life, and with the power to direct their own daily choices. Seeking greater happiness is quite rational. Obviously it&#x27;s wise to make sure one has the money one needs. But in a high-paying field like software development, and especially if you exercise willpower to keep a lot of your mandatory life costs low, it&#x27;s quite possible to intentionally have periods of &quot;unemployment&quot; and yet still be in the black financially, and get a hell of a lot of productive stuff done.

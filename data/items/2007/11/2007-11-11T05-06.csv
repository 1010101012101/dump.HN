78341,comment,78069,78189,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""But at some point, if you want to build Web apps, you are going to have to learn to install software and set up a database and really learn to use a code editor.""<p>Why?  I mean, yes, you absolutely have to have those skills today.<p>But for a lot of uses, this service, if it actually works would be more than adequate.  And there is a ""code editor"" in the demos.  Probably not a very good one, yet, but I bet it gets a lot better quickly.<p>Saying ""you can't do web development in a web browser"" is like saying ""you can't run office applications in a web browser"" or ""you can't edit photos in a web browser"".  Every day those ""can't do in a web browser"" items get whittled away a little more.<p>Having said that, perhaps you're getting at ""leaky abstractions""?  There will always be something that you need to tweak, as a developer, that the development environment hasn't made accessible to you.  That is certainly true, but I think that could become the exception more and more, and day to day development could happen in a web development environment.  Developing in the exact same environment in which your app is running certainly raises interesting possibilities.",1194759138

78339,comment,78315,78324,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"I am taking Discrete right now, it does include some combinatorics but there is a class that goes into them more in-depth.  Already took Calc I, II, III, and Diff. Eq's as an AE major (kinda rusty though).  Linear Algebra is required for the minor, so it's good that it may prove useful.  Other than Discrete, do any courses typically emphasize set theory?  ",1194758690

-password-protect it with .htaccess, or better yet:
-make the repository only accessible via ssh, and 
-set up Trac or something similar if you want bug tracking and friendly svn browsing over http.<p>I haven't set up either of these myself so I can't help you there, but I would be willing to bet that Google can answer your questions :)",1194758105

I know version control systems have been called ""time machines"", but they show you what's in the past, not what's in the future.<p>Generally speaking though -- if you don't want people to look at files, don't put them only a web server.",1194757428

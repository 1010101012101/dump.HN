I have had serious outages caused by DAS back in the SCSI-3 VHDCI days, so I'm likely to start with the 36 bay system.)<p>for my mass storage project.  they are both well under $1500 with power supplies, backplanes and expanders taken care of.<p>For me, the big thing is that with my storage model, I'm going to be replacing disks as they fail and rebuilding the RAID, so having easily accessible and easily swapped disks is worth paying a premium.  (I am planning to have some cross-chassis redundancy by using zfs snapshots, but I'd rather just keep the nodes going as is.)<p>Also, rack density?  doesn't save you that much money. Most of what you are paying for in a data center is power. At the cheapest co-lo I'm in, here is the cost breakdown:<p>1 full cabinet (44u) with two twenty-amp 120v circuits: $875\n1 full cabinet (44u) with one twenty-amp 120v circuit: $530<p>So, if I can double my density, I save $185 a month;  and even at the disk density for my compute nodes (close to 100 disks in a rack)  I get one disk failure maybe every two months per rack;  so if I have to slide out the whole goddam computer, causing some chance of the power getting disconnected and downtime?  yeah, with my model?  it's probably worth paying the premium.<p>I'm just saying;  if you are small enough that paying five grand for a backblaze pod.<p>Sure, at-scale, it's best to design your systems so that you can get zero downtime even when hardware fails.  But, that's really difficult to do without introducing new failure modes;  even amazon has trouble with it.  My strategy is to accept that hardware failures mean a truck roll and downtime for customers on the hardware in question.  As long as you don't have any one server go down more than once a year, (and a particular server failing once a year is pretty pathetic)  and as long as you don't have a system where any one server brings down everyone, you are going to see pretty good reliability using this strategy.",1318373950

Dart's type system can't even ensure, at compile-time, that you'll never see an integer in a variable typed as a string. It can catch a lot of such cases, but it's fundamentally a dynamically-typed language and can't make really any guarantees at all statically. So non-nullable types in Dart would be a fiction.

(45) virtual currency that can be monetized, re-sold or converted to physical or digital goods or services or otherwise exit the virtual world."" - https://stripe.com/tos<p>I understand that this is about laws regarding money laundering and funding terrorism and all that ""Evil Stuff Which We Need To Stop At Any Cost"" nonsense. However, this position, of automatically disallowing the conversion of virtual money to ""real"" money, effectively makes impossible a viable online economy, and that's simply because people would not be allowed to extract money which they earned through work which benefited an online community.<p>Hypothetically, I create yet another clone of Flickr. My clone's claim to fame is that searching, based on user-generated tags, is exceptionally accurate. This accuracy is due to users being unusually motivated to provide numerous and correct tags for their own pictures, as well as for those of other users. The reason for this motivation is that they are being paid, per tag, in my virtual currency. Also, they are careful with details because inaccuracy costs them money. The whole thing is kind of like HN's karma, but with real value added.<p>They can then use that money to purchase more bandwidth for their own pictures, to trade with other users for favors, or for whatever other reason which makes sense within the economy of my Flickr clone. So, someone without a credit card can earn, through real and useful work, the same kind of benefits that those who do have credit cards, but who do not put in any work for the benefit of the community. Now, what if some people wanted to put in so much effort that they would start to earn significant money? Due to these laws, those people are stuck, because they can never withdraw that virtual money, in the form of ""real"" money.<p>I could have two forms of virtual currency, one which came from credit cards, and one which was wholly generated by my system, but then lazy people, with credit cards, wouldn't be able to pay those without credit cards, to generate tags for them. Other thoughts I've had only serve to add even more complexity. I would like to hear ideas on how to solve this problem without violating laws or the credit card processor's TOS because, to me, it's obvious that the next level of social websites must have the ability to give users more power than simply generating content, and that this power should be in the form of a real economy.",1318372096

Am I happy with that? Sure, but it's not a money-maker. From what I've read, one needs to attract upwards of 100K visitors/month to be able to make some money from it. Currently, 130 people subscribe to my main (Wordpress) blog, though I don't believe WP offered the 'subscribe' widget the entire time I've been with them.<p>In the meantime, I've used the main blog's template, topic-wise, to create around 10 other blogs on other subjects. I eventually got burnt out and consolidated to 3 but then I deleted the least popular and stopped updating the second to last.<p>At my height, which I sustained for around 3 years, I was posting between one and two posts per day. For the main blog, I also made cards to hand out and tees to sell.<p>What I essentially did the majority of my time is curation and curation is a lot easier (if you know how to do it) than coming up with original content, which is what I've been doing with the main blog for most of 2011 when I switched gears. 'Coincidentally', this is also when many readers said bye-bye.<p>People I share links with, who blog on the same topic, usually write personal blogs and a few of them get 20-50 comments with every post. I, on the other hand, am lucky if I get 2-3. Basically, I get more hits but less comments.<p>All in all, I see my retirement from blogging in the near future because I feel I've mastered the topic (culture, by the way).

It was useful if ugly. I didn't fully grasp how much that null possibility permeated my code, since I didn't know any other way.<p>However, in Haskell, if something is an integer, it really is an integer of some sort. Null is not allowed.<p>So if you're writing a function that works with numbers, you really have to think about what are valid inputs and outputs. If you're working with a function whose domain really is all integers, then you can indicate that with a Integer -> Integer function, and you're on rock solid ground.<p>However, if you're writing a function like, e.g. square root, where the domain is not all integers, then you have to worry about what happens if you get a negative one. Now you can <i>choose</i> to bring in ""null"" as an allowable value, but it will have to be explicitly indicated and dealt with. Your function, for all the world to see, will be Integer -> Maybe Integer, and then any other function that uses that function will be forced to deal with the fact that a null might happen.",1318371525

Instead of a .svn directory in every directory in the working copy, Subversion 1.7 working copies have just one .svn directoryin the root of the working copy. This directory includes (among other things) an SQLite-backed database which contains all of the metadata Subversion needs for that working copy.<p>svn patch<p>Subversion 1.7 features a new subcommand called svn patch which can apply patch files in unidiff format (as produced by svn diff and other diff tools) to a working copy.<p>Improved HTTP protocol usage<p>Subversion 1.7 offers a simpler HTTP protocol variant that can be used when connecting to supported servers. This simpler protocol (sometimes referred to as HTTPv2) requires fewer client-server round trips to establish a connection, making Subversion much more performant on high-latency network connections.",1318370643

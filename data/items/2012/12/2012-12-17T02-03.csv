Conclusion was while smart, I was also too slow.<p>Current employer, the CEO explained why they were having a hard time finding me hours is that I have a habit of providing unconventional solutions ( Made a NoSQL wysiwyg CMS for Facebook apps, used sqlite instead of an in house XML powered CMS, and insisted on unit-tests for another client).   Instead of being laid off right there, they were going to try a devops role for me and then if it didn't work lay me off with severance.<p>Still smart, but not providing the results they desire.<p>While I feel like I generally made the right decisions, the impression from the PM's is that I didn't.  I could try and lawyer my way through and try and prove that I was aiming for the least riskiest approach but that is a losing game as I am fighting impressions and not facts.<p>Besides jumping ship and finding employment elsewhere ( and very possibly experiencing the same problems ) is there an alternative direction?  Maybe the devops role will work better, but maybe it won't and the same problems will continue.  Has anyone been in this situation with their career and what did you do in response to make yourself a better/more viable employee?",1355713128

Next you will say man never landed on moon. Move on!<p>I do see that JohnLatter/LatterJohn/<blah> has created multiple accounts to post. But that doesn't make me as a sock-puppet account. It actually makes me believe that he indeed has some issues.
Just because he has a different POV(and that coming from living with something similar, at-least as per his post), it doesn't make it right for folks to simply deflect it as ""stupid"". Things like autism/aspy are something that needs a lot more to be studied upon and folks like us can not view those folks through the same lens of ""common world"" as we know it. They are different and unfortunate thing is most of the time they can't really explain to me and you what that ""difference"" is. We force them to be like us and when they rebel we call them stupid and what not and there by pushing those folks to a corner.

Rather, the idea is that, in dev, you use vagrant to provision a VM (or multiple VMs; you can replicate your whole stack with multiple web servers, database clusters, load balancers, etc.) which is as close to your production environment as possible.  Then you manage this dev environment the exact same way you manage your production environment - with chef or puppet.<p>Vagrant is taking the role of Amazon's EC2 control panel or the order form on your dedicated server providers website.

4930600,comment,4930398,4930398,1,0,cerales,,,"> Why is there this special function that construct these three random types? I dont know.<p>It's reasonable for someone to be confused about this; my rationale is that these three types are basically where go allows ""magic"": all of them support special syntaxes (the range operator, optional multi-value context when looking up a map, the select operator on channels), so they have a magic initialiser, ignoring Go's usual ""declaration is initialisation"" rule.<p>As others have said, it's not too bad a special case in the context of the language. The problem I have with it is that it introduces the possibility of run-time errors that in a language this advanced and generally so well-designed should probably be compiled-time errors: panics when you assign to keys in nil maps or deadlocks when you send to a channel you forgot to initialise are both errors of a class that the language generally doesn't have.",1355712770

You make a few barbed comments about the language designers, but you are nowhere near familiar enough with Go to be justified in doing so (IMO).<p>> If Foo is derived from a struct, and it doesnt work when zero-valued, then there should be a function somewhere called something like NewFoo. Good luck finding the right one.<p>I've never needed luck, here. This isn't a real problem for actual Go programmers.<p>> Why is there this special function that construct these three random types?<p>They're not ""random types"". They're special built in types that are managed by the language runtime. That makes them distinct from anything you can write as a user, and that's why they use the built in make function for initialization.<p>> I think channels are value types, which is strange since its the only other type created with make.<p>No, channels are reference types, too.

4930488,comment,4929279,4930166,2,0,splinterofchaos,,,">  The sort of immutable container logic that people associate with FP is against the nature of C++...<p>My argument is that C++, a multi-paradigm language, benefits from not being bound to purity and that being able to mix imperative and functional code is a good thing. We aren't stuck in pure-land so we can insert IO where it needs to be, not where it propagates, but neither do we need to be stuck in state-land. Functional programming is not against the ""nature"" of the language, it gives us the freedom to choose.<p>> Because the first does not copy the container and its elements...<p>This is a quality of implementation detail. It would have been detrimental to the point of the article to waste time showing optimizations such as ""if F is a function X to X, use the in-place version"". But I assure you, my optimization testing has shown there is little difference between the code generated by this and vanilla <algorithm>. In fact, it is at times better.<p><a href=""https://github.com/splinterofchaos/Pure/blob/master/samples/efficiency-fold-map.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/splinterofchaos/Pure/blob/master/samples/...</a>",1355710007

4930479,comment,4905684,4919001,1,0,mcherm,,,"> this analysis is not at the correct level of abstraction for maximum understanding<p>That, by the way, is exactly the reasoning I used when dismissing the claim that ""women have affairs to increase the genetic diversity of the sperm that compete for her egg"". There are various different depths of causality and levels of abstraction at which one could view women having affairs. That particular level is one which provides almost no explanatory benefit.<p>(Unrelated point below.)<p>In addition, it may also be wrong. At previous points in time scientists have claimed that there was an ""obvious"" evolutionary reason why women DIDN'T have affairs. The argument, as I have heard it, states that in primates the male of the species gets the most genetic diversity by having as many children as possible with as many females as possible. But since the female is limited by biology to a fairly small number offspring, she is better served (evolutionarily) by remaining loyal to a single male in order to increase the degree to which he will help provide for her offspring and thus increase their survival rate. (Remember: it's not the number of offspring, it's the number of offspring times their survival rate that counts.)<p>Of course, this theory was in vogue at a time when lots of people (erroneously) believed that men had affairs but women didn't. MY conclusion is that it's extremely easy to fool ourselves with evolutionary-sounding excuses for social and cultural behavior and that one should approach any such explanation with extreme skepticism.",1355709879

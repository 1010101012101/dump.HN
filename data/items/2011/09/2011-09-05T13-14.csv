2962201,comment,2960111,2961642,1,0,Mz,,,"Thanks for your reply.  But I don't feel that has any real bearing on my point. Investing and building a product are two different things.  Steve Jobs took a class in calligraphy.  He has said that is why the Mac has beautiful typography and that Microsoft basically copied what Apple was doing, so had he not done that, it's likely no computer would have good typography.  I imagine that would have been a significant problem and would have seriously hindered the computer industry.  It's a ""touchy feely"" kind of thing -- I mean it's about aesthetics (or more generally what has personal appeal to humans), which often get dismissed as icing on the cake but, in reality, design of that sort has significant value in terms of legibility and therefore ease of use.<p>So I think it is pretty widely acknowledged that his influence goes far beyond figuring out how to make money. It goes far beyond merely building Apple. Microsoft copied what he did.  His value judgment about what was important (with regards to typography) has thus basically influenced 'all' computers.  What I don't think I have ever seen anyone explicitly say is that without his insistence on good typography, it's possible computers would have never been popularized to the degree they have been.  That's the kind of thing that mere self discipline doesn't fully explain.  I think that's the kind of thing which falls in the ""mystique"" category.<p>Peace and have a good day.",1315231197

2962199,comment,2962087,2962127,3,0,superalloy,,,"The reason that people use (mac)vim is <i>not</i> necessarily the powerful navigation keys etc. For me its the ability to deal with large files and the crazy indentation rules people use and I know its the same for quite some other users.<p>The way people work differs from person to person, the idea that someone should always just keep on trying, even if something doesn't feel right, is in my opinion useless. The real moral here is that people should accept that everybody is different and that its ok for them to be different and how great it is that open-source software such as vim enables them to do so. Something thats unfortunately always a bit harder for passionate users. (No insult intended!)<p>I definitely know that _I_ prefer to browse a project with a GUI that works like in the rest of my platform of choice, but I also know Im very different from the average vim user :)",1315231139

2962189,comment,2962087,2962087,30,0,thristian,,,"I've always been a little puzzled by people who use a file-drawer or file-list or similar addon with Vim, and I now I think I know why: I'm guessing most of these people have Vim open as their One Tool, much like another programmer might have Xcode or Visual Studio open as their One Tool, and they want to get everything done in it.<p>At work, I usually have at least two windows open at all times: Vim full-screen on one monitor, a terminal full-screen on the otheror sometimes one terminal taking up most of the screen and another smaller terminal tailing a logfile. The Vim window gets used for editing (of course), the terminal is used for running test suites and exploring the codebase and finding and opening files in Vim. The reason I've never felt the need for a file-browser plugin in Vim is because I've always used Vim with an external file-browser. :)<p>If anyone's interested in opening files in an existing gvim window from the terminal, here's the script I use in Linux:<p><pre><code>    gvim -f --remote-tab-silent ""$@"" &
</code></pre>
(I believe MacVim comes with a similar 'mvim' script you can use on OS X) If you don't want files to open in tabs, change ""remote-tab-silent"" to ""remote-silent"". If you call the script and there's no existing gvim window, a new one will be created.",1315230879

In fact conspiracy is the least of my concerns...I am more concerned about the money that is being handed out in plain sight.<p>When it comes down to it, you cannot pin responsibility on any one party, but one thing did happen as a result, and some of this result was intentionally manufactured.  That end result is the poor/middle-class getting poorer, and a few (transparently) dishonest people getting richer.  But worst of all, a huge blow was taken on the economy that is affecting everybody, including the (honest) wealthy classes.<p>You can trace the beginning of the recession back 15 years or so.  The funny thing is that people try to point fingers at Democrats or Republicans exclusively, while both parties have done their fair share of damage.  And even US citizens have done a lot of damage, but there is a difference between being reckless and being naive.  The former describes the people who leveraged debt, the latter describes your average US home buyer.<p>When it comes down to it, maybe no one was singularly responsible, but that does not really matter.  What matters is that wealthy owners of private organizations were given tax-payer money.  Executives were given golden parachutes even though their companies were bankrupt - guess who paid for these?  Tax payer money was funneled into private companies with the purpose of ""saving"" them, only to have them trade as junk stock within a few months.  Honest people were given mortgages that would soon turn into foreclosures - no one's fault, but I think they should be the people bailed out, not these corporations.",1315230036

I agree that teaching kids to sit in neat rows has outlived its usefulness, but at this point I think we can write off that observation as being the low-hanging fruit of educational critique. The important question is: what do we do instead?<p>I assume nobody's seriously proposing home-schooling, unless they intend to drop their life's work for a decade and a half to become teachers. The Khan Academy is a long way off being a replacement for, say, a decent literacy teacher. So what's being advocated here? Don't send your kids to school at all? Send them there but teach them to treat the whole thing as an ironic schlepp through antiquity?<p>I, for one, would love to see some treatment of the Montessori method[1] which, although a bit hand-wavy, seems to be based on self-direction and has a promising concurrence with Piaget's developmental research. Or Waldorf/Steiner schools[2], which seem to be a more creative form of education with a focus on art and autonomy.<p>I don't know nearly enough about those schools and other alternative forms of education to know if they actually work, but if anyone's searching for something to say on education and the new new economy, I sure would appreciate some positive directions rather than more ol' faithful Ford-bashing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education</a>",1315229275

On the most expensive, dangerous, environmentally costly common mode of transportation out there.<p>There's no good reason why trains should be <i>less</i> efficient than the car. None at all. That gives us a starting point, which should be easy to beat, of $0.10 per passenger per mile for a 75 mph train.<p>Now, most costs in transportation are labor costs, so it stands to reason (below the sound barrier) that what things ""should"" cost (excluding fuel) can be measured on a per-hour basis. Travel at 300 mph should be <i>cheaper</i>, for this reason-- perhaps not 4 times cheaper because energy costs increase, but definitely 3.<p>That's what's counter-intuitive here: slow travel is more expensive, in terms of what it actually costs the provider, than fast travel because it sucks up more employee time.<p>Realistically, $0.05 per passenger mile would be a substantial accomplishment.

While I am making the transition to a web developer at the moment, I have a graduate degree in Economics and I have spent some time working in the investment industry (Main St, not Wall St). I would just like to share an alternative viewpoint with you:<p>1) I wouldn't think of it as ""cheating the system"", but I would think of it as rational self-interest. Given a set of constraints, people will optimize for the best personal outcome.<p>2) People maximize their utility (utility is a measure of happiness). Whether someone is honest or dishonest is nothing more than a preference input into their utility maximization functions.<p>What this means is that if the punishment for breaking some law is exceeded by the benefits (to the individual) of doing so, then that individual will break the law. Think about how many people casually drive 5 to 10 miles over the speed limit (or 20 to 30 down here in Texas).<p>With that said, whose dishonesty is responsible for the housing collapse:<p>* Were the homeowners dishonest for taking on loans they could not afford to pay back?<p>* Were the lenders and real estate agents dishonest for making the loans to the home owners?<p>* Were the finance guys responsible for thinking that risk could be mitigated using the tools of finance?<p>* Were the investors being dishonest for cheering on returns that were above market-average without considering the risk?<p>Painting a market with the brushes of corruption and dishonesty does very little to advance an understanding of how the event happened and what can be done to prevent it in the future.<p>4) Professionals with an understanding of the financial industry were generally in favor of the bailouts. The government listened to the professionals.<p>Goldman Sachs hires <i>a lot</i> of economists and finance guys, and they hire the people with the best resumes. One should hardly scream conspiracy if it turns out that some of these ""cream of the crop"" individuals end up working in the treasury. Statistically, the probability of it happening randomly is actually quite high.<p><i>""Likewise, I think that the best economy will be produced by many mistakes, and learning from them.""</i><p>I completely agree with this.<p><i>""One thing I am pretty sure we will learn is that no corruptible entity should ever control an economy, because corruption is always the end result. (All hail our new robot overlords :D)""</i><p>There is no need for us to resort to robots. We simply have to understand that people are self-interested and build a system that channels this self-interest into outcomes that are efficient for society as a whole.<p><i>""And I will just leave this here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_von_Hayek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_von_Hayek</a> I'm sure you have probably read up on this guy.""</i><p>Hayek was an amazing logician, but the application of his theories to the modern economy is unproductive. The questions that he asked have been answered by modern economics in the 50 years that have passed since he asked them.<p>I consider myself an advocate for breaking down the wall that exists between modern economics and people that would like to increase their understanding of modern economics without being economists themselves. If you have anything that you would like to ask me about anything that I wrote above (or any of Hayek's specific points), then I would be happy to answer them (regardless of the beating that my karma takes).",1315228155

9690324,comment,9684741,9687539,0,0,pron,,,"> The author&#x27;s point is to avoid interleaving logic and side-effects<p>But with mocks you&#x27;re not really interleaving side effects. They are the same as generating &quot;effect values&quot;, only they use the same API as the actual effect.<p>> The nice thing about the latter is that every action gets reified into a concrete value, on which we can perform any kind of computation we like.<p>That&#x27;s what mocks do. They capture calls and turn them into reified values that can then be manipulated and queried.<p>> Mocks do require a new DSL for capturing and describing effects; it&#x27;s normally called a &quot;public interface&quot;, but it is a DSL (an algebra) for describing effects.<p>Except that API is identical to that of whatever effect API we&#x27;re using.<p>A mock <i>is</i> a mechanism for turning effects into values. It just works automatically by means of interfaces (in the language sense) and reflection. It is an imperative construct that achieves -- without extra work -- the very same functional effect the author is striving for.",1433915975

9690291,comment,9689568,9689943,0,0,boken,,,"As someone else said, there&#x27;s not enough room here. I&#x27;m not particularly fond of Hemingway, but not because I take his carefully fashioned pith as evidence that he has no &quot;literary talent.&quot; And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to conclude, on seeing that my tastes are at odds with some majority, that <i>they</i> must have been swayed by anything &quot;like...some shadowy cabal.&quot;<p>Suffice it to say that breadth of vocabulary is a poor rubric for evaluating literary works, almost without exception. For Hemingway and many others, it is better to have the words at hand than forcibly to use them. For a reader, it is worth reflecting on why a writer chose the words they did, rather than assuming they could have done no differently. Much of the history of high-brow English literature consists of taking old forms and making them more nearly vulgar. More than a century before Hemingway, Wordsworth made a name for himself for his vernacular—to pick an example out of a hat. Closer to Hemingway&#x27;s time, Mark Twain famously cut down James Fenimore Cooper for failing to &quot;[e]schew surplusage&quot; or &quot;[e]mploy a simple and straightforward style&quot;[1], adages that Hemingway can be said to have written by, at least in his best-remembered works. Hemingway fulfilled—or continued to work toward—one of the stronger and more common impetuses in English literature and criticism: to write using ordinary language, and to do so <i>exactly.</i><p>I would add that it is useful in the study of literature and literary criticism to dislike something, particularly if it is an entrenched part of whatever canon you find yourself surrounded by. It means you have something to think about, concerning the work, yourself, and others. Which are the three most important things with regard to art—not in any particular order.<p>[1] <a href=""http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/projects/rissetto/offense.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/projects/rissetto/offense.html</a>",1433915230

9690287,comment,9687681,9689383,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Years ago, I dated a girl who I suspect would classify as BPD. I’m generally good natured, patient, and accepting, but at least at that moment in her life, it would have taken someone with superhuman patience and tolerance for abuse to properly help and support her, and probably not via a romantic relationship.<p>Most of the time she was cheerful, funny, clever, generous, and fun to spend time with, but under stress her personality would do a 180° turn, and she would become self-centered, calculating, and paranoid. She would seize on any thought or scrap of evidence, however flimsy, to blame her distress on other people (her students, neighbors, strangers on the street, her family, me), and would maliciously lash out at people entirely out of proportion to their actions, which were often trivial mistakes or entirely unrelated to her.<p>I tried for a while to be supportive and understanding, but I was in far over my head. I felt like anything I said to her in her “nice” phase could be taken out of context, spun around, and used as a weapon, and to maintain a relationship with her would require continuous self-censorship, impossible amounts of empathy, and an iron skin for disregarding emotional attacks.<p>It was clear she was suffering and wasn’t getting the support she needed from family/friends/school/work/therapists, her childhood and former relationships had been traumatic/abusive, and in breaking things off I felt like a complete failure, under the theory that I might have been able to help if I were stronger. To be honest though, I’m not sure a person/role exists who could have given her the support she really needed at that time. I can only hope that the passage of time has helped her figure out some better coping mechanisms and less damaging ways of relating to people, but we haven’t spoken since, so I have no idea how she’s doing.<p>The experience left me an emotional wreck, and it took me several months to recover. I didn’t date anyone again for over a year afterward.<p>All of which is to say, I can well understand why people, even professional therapists or family members, might be unwilling to engage. It’s extremely unpleasant and stressful, with high risk, for mostly someone else’s benefit.",1433915184

9690266,comment,9690259,9690259,0,0,RodericDay,,,"<i>I sat in on an interview for a new administrative assistant once. My regional vice president was doing the hiring. A long line of mostly black and brown women applied because we were a cosmetology school. Trade schools at the margins of skilled labor in a gendered field are necessarily classed and raced. I found one candidate particularly charming. She was trying to get out of a salon because 10 hours on her feet cutting hair would average out to an hourly rate below minimum wage. A desk job with 40 set hours and medical benefits represented mobility for her. When she left my VP turned to me and said, “did you see that tank top she had on under her blouse?! OMG, you wear a silk shell, not a tank top!” Both of the women were black.<p>The VP had constructed her job as senior management. She drove a brand new BMW because she, “should treat herself” and liked to tell us that ours was an image business. A girl wearing a cotton tank top as a shell was incompatible with BMW-driving VPs in the image business. Gatekeeping is a complex job of managing boundaries that do not just define others but that also define ourselves. Status symbols — silk shells, designer shoes, luxury handbags — become keys to unlock these gates. If I need a job that will save my lower back and move my baby from medicaid to an HMO, how much should I spend signaling to people like my former VP that I will not compromise her status by opening the door to me? That candidate maybe could not afford a proper shell. I will never know. But I do know that had she gone hungry for two days to pay for it or missed wages for a trip to the store to buy it, she may have been rewarded a job that could have lifted her above minimum wage. Shells aren’t designer handbags, perhaps. But a cosmetology school in a strip mall isn’t a job at Bank of America, either.</i>",1433914671

If it doesn&#x27;t, you need to move somewhere that does.  You&#x27;re the reason volunteers spend their time on those phones, so call them.  They&#x27;re gay, and they know where gay people hang out in your part of the world.<p>> Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? How did you get out of it?<p>By joining the university choral society, persistence, and a fair bit of luck.  You&#x27;ll probably do it differently.<p>> None of my friends are gay, nor do they know any gay people.<p>Let&#x27;s do some probability theory.  Trait X is randomly distributed across 10% of the population.  (You can cut the Kinsey scale at different places.  It&#x27;s a round number, and it&#x27;s true for some plausible definition of &quot;gay&quot;.)  The likelihood of your assertion is around P=0.9^(N²), where N is the typical number of friends you or one of your friends has.  Go run hoc.<p>Case 1: P is above, say, 5%.  This is the easy case.  You could be right, and you just need to get out more.  Stop reading HN and do it.<p>Case 2: P strains credibility.  You might have to replace &quot;are&quot; with &quot;say that they are&quot;.  This is the hard case, because meeting more people who say that they&#x27;re not gay won&#x27;t help, and you need some different friends.  A few things to consider at that point:<p>Things like online dating, and events where 30% of people are gay, make it sound like you&#x27;re still at least partly in the closet.  If you fix that, you can start going to pubs and parties where 99% of people are gay, and they&#x27;re 99% sure that you are.  That makes everything much easier.

He mentions &quot;working smarter, not harder&quot; and &quot;no unnecessary logic&quot; which are both hard to disagree with. Certainly we don&#x27;t want a bunch of inlined calls and hard-to-mentally-parse-operations but that&#x27;s not what he&#x27;s advocating. In the very next section he describes code as being a means of communicating with the computer <i>and</i> humans.<p>So what&#x27;s the distinction between simply making a passable program and working smarter, without unnecessary logic? It&#x27;s hard to understand or even believe unless you&#x27;ve seen it happen. Even if you understand and believe, the magnitude of how powerful it is can easily be underestimated.<p>Take prime factors for example; how would you program it? Most people would probably expect they&#x27;ll need some kind of primes against which they can factor a given number. You might create the list of primes or have a data source somewhere, and iterate over it looking for prime factors. The result could easily grow into a (small, but) considerable program.<p>If you practice TDD and &quot;fake it till you make it&quot;, testing the next-dumbest case you can wind your way to very elegant algorithms through refactoring against tests. That <i>sounds</i> easy but in reality it often feels silly to test this one other simple edge case or to test every failure case (1..2..3..) and that makes it hard feel worth doing. It&#x27;s also difficult to look at known-working code and see the other possibilities for how the same result could be accomplished for all cases with a different methodology.<p>If you haven&#x27;t yet, check out Bob Martin&#x27;s primes kata: <a href=""http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata"" rel=""nofollow"">http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata</a>\n(The slides have a lot to be desired but the only video I could find was on vimeo with a lengthy intro and no apparent way to fast-forward)<p>Chances are we&#x27;d rather maintain the simple 3-line algorithm rather than the one with the data source and unnecessary complexity. That doesn&#x27;t mean shorter is always better, but in many of the problems we face everyday there are elegant solutions hiding in the details.

While of course they should be taken with a rather large grain of salt, providing $6-9k/yr to every American doesn&#x27;t seem to produce crazy numbers.

If I had to pick an optimal level of UBI to institute nationwide (which in some senses must exist), I would guess it to be around there.<p>That said, recently I&#x27;ve been thinking of a different approach.  Concerns about scale (and migration) are smaller if we start with a smaller amount.  I&#x27;ve been thinking an approach might be creation of a private institution tasked with designing and coordinating a basic income program for regions (probably at the city or county level, in the US) that opt in and who meet whatever necessary standards.  The program would then apply to anyone who lives or works in a participating locality.  The program could then be gradually rolled out and scaled up as (/if) it&#x27;s found to work.  National benefits can be phased out by treating BI income as income.  One thing that makes this plan seem more workable is that the organization could raise money from supportive individuals to build a buffer for the program, to serve as something of a carrot for prospective localities.",1433913634

In any case, what exactly is a speedy trial?  10 years sounds speedy to us, what the fuck are you complaining about?  The prosecutors are more worried about the conviction rate than whether the right person is jailed.  Are you sure you don&#x27;t want to please guilty and be release for time already served?<p>There have been several news articles and in fact one discussed here in the last week or so about how if you have too much cash the police can just take it.  It qualifies as civil forfeiture.  No bother about the 4th amendment.  You must be guilty of something if you carry that much cash.<p>Reference the following from the lawyer Greenwald:<p><a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/29/denny-hastert-highly-unsympathetic-face-americas-criminalization-pathology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/29/denny-hastert-...</a><p>When a country has a higher portion of their population in prison than any other country, then it is obviously the least free country.  Crimes should be objective, not subjective.  Law Enforcers seem to have free reign to persecute, harass and jail people at will.  Does it really matter when some poor black or brown kid is involved?  The country was founded on slavery.  The way to maintain the slave population is to have subjective laws where they can pretty much lock anybody up that they want.  They obviously like locking up black and brown people.  It makes it easier to identify the slave laborers.<p>Think about this.  The US has a higher proportion of the population locked up than either Russia or China.  Snowden had to ask political asylum in Russia.<p>What the fuck exactly are you expecting?  The US is undoubtedly the land of the jailed.<p>What can we as tech people do to fix this?<p>Also, note how one way to keep a government in check is via the guns and the police departments have been stock piling weapons and tons of ammunition to keep them poor people in line.<p>Voters can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t do much about it.  For the reason see the ted talk by Lawrence Lessig discussing lesterland.  Less than 150 super rich individuals contribute something like 60% of the super pac money.  The people that run the in elections have already been screened and approved up by these super rich fucks.<p>Also, to keep everybody in check, there is super surveillance in place because of the alleged terrorists.  While osama burned us on 911 by taking down the twin towers, what US citizens have done to the US government is far, far worse.  The only way to truly combat terrorism is to treat every single citizen like a terrorists and they most definitely will not qualify a country as the land of the free.<p>Read 1984, things today seem worse than portrayed in the book.<p>So, I ask again, who really gives a fuck about a poor black or brown kid when those rich fucks needs some slave labor working for 10 cents an hour in a private prison?",1433913219

Online dating, singles events, subculture meetups -- if you see them as a guarantee of some people meeting you, they&#x27;re snake oil. If you see them as what they are, just opportunities for you to overcome your fear of meeting new people, they&#x27;ll bear (...) fruit.<p>Maybe you consider yourself quite outgoing and &quot;not afraid&quot; of talking to people.

Some of them will try to get close to you.<p>At the end of the day tho, the thing which works best is to be yourself. So maybe that work on yourself you&#x27;ve been delaying, might be time to get to it. The reason is because when you&#x27;re yourself the people you meet and connect with are right for you, and also what you offer them is truly you.

With Google News, they have done a pretty good job of clustering articles on a single story. They are getting better at deriving the original source in many cases.  The simple act of duplicate detection should enable them to identify sites that scrape content and show them as duplicate results.<p>In the interests of results diversity, you don't want the same content repeated ten times on the first page, although this has the side effect of pushing the original source onto the second page if you guess wrong.",1293944296

Lots of it is in good shape, and we've been working on incremental rewrites to fix up the worst legacy spots. There are certainly bad bits, but they're also <i>working</i> bad bits, whose badness largely comes from being hard to bend to new use-cases.<p>However! I see a lot of developers who would have a hard time fixing a bug / making a small change in an area which has a lot of legacy cruft present without going and rewriting the whole thing. Now, they are <i>right</i> that rewriting it is probably the best course of action from a codebase-health viewpoint... but it's not necessarily the actual best use of their time. If code is working then it's not an urgent priority that it get rewritten.<p>To be slightly trite, ""perfect is the enemy of good.""<p>That's why we'd like to get developers who are okay with the idea of working on a codebase that contains legacy code.

There is significant overlap, and it is most notable in the less technical areas, where he lays out the arguments against the conventional wisdom.<p>That said (and I say this as a very technical reader), there were aspects of Good Calories, Bad Calories that went over my head because of their presentation and placement in the (very long) book. Why We Get Fat's treatment of LPL (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein_lipase"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein_lipase</a>) and HSL (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone-sensitive_lipase"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone-sensitive_lipase</a>), in particular, were described more clearly in the latest book, and the concepts related to them really make a difference in understanding the larger point.<p>Probably the most important thing that I got out of Why We Get Fat is a better technical understanding for one of his core arguments (that the arrow of causation in calories in, calories out may be the reverse of what we expect). Specifically, he clearly describes the mechanism by which fat cells may pull in energy from the bloodstream, resulting in additional hunger and lethargy (ad infinitum).

He has been a very good science journalist for decades, and has won the the Science in Society Award of the National Association of Science Writers three times. He does his homework.<p>Again, I recommend that those whose gut reaction is to be skeptical of Taubes' thesis read at least his latest book, which addresses, very carefully, virtually all of the common reactions people have in these kinds of online fora.

2059382,comment,2057963,2058167,0,0,vibhavs,,,"So I had to go look up noatime. Here's what I found:<p>""Linux [and presumably Mac OS X] has a special mount option for file systems called noatime that can be added to each line that addresses one file system in the /etc/fstab file. If a file system has been mounted with this option, reading accesses to the file system will no longer result in an update to the atime information associated with the file like we have explained above. The importance of the noatime setting is that it eliminates the need by the system to make writes to the file system for files which are simply being read. Since writes can be somewhat expensive, this can result in measurable performance gains. Note that the write time information to a file will continue to be updated anytime the file is written to.""<p>(<a href=""http://tldp.org/LDP/solrhe/Securing-Optimizing-Linux-RH-Edition-v1.3/chap6sec73.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tldp.org/LDP/solrhe/Securing-Optimizing-Linux-RH-Edit...</a>).<p>stcredzero, I'm curious to see how you set up your partitions to take advantage of noatime.",1293941980

2059372,comment,2058810,2058810,0,0,solipsist,,,"It really does seem that there was less of a focus on design back in the day. Sure, times change, fads come and go, and styles change. However, you can't tell me that Youtube's page was anything pretty even with 2005 standards [1] or that Wikipedia invested a lot in their design [2]<p>What's not surprising is that this seems to be changing. Businesses are investing thousands on the design of their websites and it hard to believe that any more money spent in the area could really make them noticeably better. Twitter, an example of a website that is leading the next generation of the Internet, seems to have been quite stylish when it came out itself. They probably didn't spend that much money on design, but it's evident that they spent time on it. Other startups are doing the same - coming out with killer designs the moment they are released. That definitely wasn't the philosophy 10 or 15 years ago (just look at Google [3]), when design took time to evolve and never started out that good.<p>However, all of this brings up the issue of functionality in comparison design. I'm sure there were websites at the time that had spent money and time on a good design, but those aren't the ones that succeeded. The ones that ended up becoming the internet giants of 2011 were the ones with hideous interfaces and childish logos, but evidently with great functionality. Does that mean that all the time we are spending on design is useless, or that design itself is useful and has become a bigger factor in what makes a website successful today?<p>Personally, I think that the time we spend on design is worthwhile, as our usage of the web has increased dramatically over time and therefore a slick and intuitive interface is a key component for a website to have. Users spend so much time on certain webpages, that unless another one can prove to have a more productive and pleasing interface, there is no reason to switch.

On an article-by-article basis, propose articles for final rev in the same way they are proposed for FA class.  This would involve a thorough review, hopefully be experts in the field, to weed out inaccuracies.  Then, the article would be fully protected indefinitely.  Proposed changes could be submitted, but the idea would be to consider it a final product. By moving through many of the articles that would be suitable for this process, we could focus the community's energy on improving articles that needed it.  I think we've written most of what needs to be written.  With the exception of dynamic subjects, we should be archiving those articles which are done.<p>As far as encouraging new editors, we need to stop the manic approach to vandal fighting.  Vandalism is a problem, sure, but there are far more people who are driven away by hasty reverts and unfriendly warnings.<p>As far as admins are concerned, it really needs to be <i>no big deal</i>.  Perhaps an admin review noticeboard, to look at questionable admin actions, and a clear demoppping process.  Other than that, promote editors pseudo-randomly.  I think by throwing mops at editors without requiring RfA, we could eliminate a lot of the politicking that goes on.  If you need more admins, promote more.  We know that the statistically optimum way of promoting people within an organization is to do so randomly, and I think Wikipedia would be a great testbed to try that theory out.",1293941204

This competition among school districts has promoted innovation in programs and resulted in a fair amount of interchange among students who live in different neighborhoods.

Some school districts gain almost half of their enrollment from open enrollment, and correspondingly some of the historically worst school districts in Minnesota have lost large percentages of enrollment to families crossing district boundaries to look for better schools. (Minnesota also has a huge number of charter schools, which is a distinct form of competition for publicly subsidized students, but they cannot offer some of the programs that public school districts can.) This competition keeps all districts accountable for providing a good learning environment, and helps change the psychology of teachers and principals dealing with families from one of treating learners as a burden to one of treating learners as an opportunity to be grateful for.<p>Any other state in the United States could do the same, and a few already have.<p><a href=""http://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=649&Itemid=636"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ecs.org/html/offsite.asp?document=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eecs%2Eorg%2FOpenEnrollmentDatabase"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecs.org/html/offsite.asp?document=http%3A%2F%2Fww...</a>",1317606331

Not all apps are created equally and some are less responsible with their memory and how many CPU cycles they consume. With a true multiprocess OS like Android, this can be problematic as background applications can be unnecessarily greedy. One application that can help determine what applications are consuming CPU, memory, and battery is ""System"" by NextApp, Inc. With System's monitoring capability you can often determine which applications are misbehaving.<p>I once was trying to figure out why my battery was only lasting four hours. I used System's monitoring and figured out that the Facebook app was consuming >90% of CPU cycles. I learned later that the bug was confirmed and that Facebook fixed the problem, but in the meantime, I was able to uninstall Facebook and thus I restored my phone's battery life and responsiveness.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of other good system monitoring applications for Android.

For some people, me for example, professional fulfillment is tied to my personal life in a way that if I'm not professionally happy, i'm not personally happy.  For lots of people, it's the opposite.<p>The grass is always greener...which isn't to say that it's actually not.  A smaller company or startup will be different...that's all you'll know for sure.  You may gain autonomy and pride in your contribution, but find that the overall lack of progress and general lack of certainty just as disheartening.  2 months into a project, the directive might be abandoned...it's just the way it goes sometimes.<p>If you want to test the waters as a consultant or start your own consulting business, take a ~60 hour job and a week of vacation.  If it moves you, you'll know.<p>Culture is important.  But, it sounds like you are bumping into the harsh reality that many companies throw culture out the window when it's not convenient.  That happens almost everywhere, unfortunately.<p>It sounds like you might be just about ready for shakeup.  It sounds like you have the credentials / experience to make a move and if it doesn't work out, take a mulligan.  That being said, if you aren't unhappy enough to quit outright, it might not be that bad (but, clearly isn't that good).<p>Another approach that has worked in the past is a transfer.  Maybe your current project is too big, manager sucks, cross-functional team is composed to biz guys that think all you have to do is toss a code monkey a banana once in a while...maybe you can get on a more entrepreneurial team on, a nascent project, a your current employer.<p>I hope it you find what you are looking for...it sux when someone beats the life out of something you really love to do.",1317605408

881540,comment,881361,881361,0,0,cschick2317,,,"This is a tough topic.<p>On one hand, people really shouldn't end up financially devastated after treating an illness.  I'm sure we all feel some mental stress at the thought that if something catastrophic and unexpected happens we may be financially screwed the rest of our lives.<p>On the other hand...a lot of people do a lot of stupid things that I don't necessarily want to pay for.  Smoking and obesity are two very costly life style choices (Note: I'm aware some people are obese because of medical reasons, I'm not talking about them).  And I'm not sure I feel it's fair to pass those costs onto the rest of us who don't smoke and keep a healthy weight and keep our cholesterol and blood pressure and whatnot in a healthy range.  Ultimately though, we could get way too nitpicky about ""who is doing what to themselves and shouldn't get covered"".<p>In a perfect world I think a non-profit health insurance system should be created that everyone has to buy into.  On top of that, to keep costs down, the majority of people would try to stay healthy and doctors wouldn't be paid per test.  However, I don't think anything we do will work unless we address why health care costs so much and start taking responsibility for our own health.",1255535917

881531,comment,881474,881474,0,0,sachinag,,,"The VC firm I used to work at only took Board Observer spots, even in situations when we'd lead deals.  The reason for this was essentially cultural (it was a captive arm of a much larger company), but I still think Observer roles are OK even without external considerations.  To me, the argument is that every new person you put in that room introduces this element - this is essentially an argument for smaller Boards, not that Observers are bad.<p>Lookit, I refuse to believe that a Board Observer can really wheedle three other high-ego VC Partners to a terrible decision that they would otherwise have avoided.  And if it can happen, then what's to say that the opposite can't happen - that the Observer doesn't save the company from a disastrous outcome?<p>Selfishly, the opportunity to go to a few board meetings - both alone and with the partner - was great for me personally.  I got a much better understanding of how to run a meeting, what's discussed, what materials, and what does and does not come up for a vote.

I don't think they did; I think they happened before the downgrade when they thought times were good because it later says the Harley sat for months before a buyer was found - so it's sold off now. The house and kids situation is similar as well. Obviously the kids all happened prior to this situation when they felt they were moving up in the world. You can't just un-have kids when things get tough later! The house deal sounded like it was in progress when the downgrade came. Now they're effectively trapped there. You can't just sell a house immediately after buying and expect to break even - they'd likely end up taking a loss selling the house (especially if the real estate market there is still dropping). (Of course it's important to consider if the loss of selling now offsets the loss of paying a higher mortgage payment while you wait for things to recover.) If they had canceled the in-progress house deal at the last minute, they'd probably have been liable for some fees or perhaps even a lawsuit from the seller. (I've lived in my house just over 2 years and will be selling it soon due to a job and location change and we'll be lucky to even break even - and we paid a lot extra on principal each month while the times were good!)<p>EDIT: I missed that the house they bought was actually his parents!

Conducted over a four-year period, the project was able to track many students throughout their time at Carnegie Mellon.  By interviewing students once a semester.</i>""<p>2) Education of new teachers of Advanced Placement (AP) Exam for Computer Science in a teacher summer school and alerting them to the gender gap in computing. This summer school took place in CMU, and since it was addressing gender gap, CMU became some sort of Mecca for those who who care about women's involvement in computing.<p>3) Revamping of the admissions process. ""<i>In addition to demonstrated academic competence, the Admissions Office 
began giving more weight to non-academic factors, looking for applicants with leadership potential and a commitment to “give back to the community.” These broadened criteria 
also became important in awarding financial aid .. About the same time, Allan Fisher also conveyed to the Admissions Office his goal of a gender-balanced program.  He felt it was important to get the message out that “no prior programming experience is necessary” to enter the CMU computer science program. The image of a CS student as someone (usually male) who has played with computers since 
early childhood is widespread. This often discourages many otherwise talented students from applying to a computer science program.""<p>4) ""</i>A Supportive Community: The Women@SCS Advisory Council: The Women@SCS Advisory Council was created in the fall of 1999 and has since met weekly during the academic year.  Membership includes undergraduates representing all four years and graduate students representing the various departments within SCS*"".

<i>The most extensive single activity of the Women@SCS Advisory Council has been the
Big Sister/Little Sister program, which pairs upper-class and graduate students with firstyear
and sophomore CS majors.</i><p>Changing emphasis/delivery of (introductory) courses
<i>Even more, insights provided by the Council are likely to have profound impact on the
curriculum. In her green paper circulated at a meeting with faculty, senior Ting-Chih
Shih clearly pointed out that the current CS undergraduate curriculum serves male
students far better than females. For one, the entry programming courses favor students
with more experience (usually men) who seem to get better scores effortlessly As a
result, many women begin thinking that learning computer science takes innate talent
and no amount of hard work will pay off They start to lose confidence and forget their
initial interest in computer science Moreover, the way lectures are presented seem to
appeal to men more. In general, females feel that the birds-eye view of a problem, and the
end result, are more relevant than the coding details in between</i>",1256802902

But who is right or wrong on the subject of flu vaccines itself is an entirely different matter on which I have no opinion.<p>I got the impression that even researchers who are in favor of the vaccine accepted it was uncertain whether it worked, but at the same time found it unethical to test whether it did actually work.<p>If that is really the argument and not just a distorted picture presented by incompetent journalists, then I think ethics is either an excuse for some vested interests or just incompetence in field of ethics.<p>I talked to a philosopher yesterday who specialises in ethics. He confirmed my view that _if_ we didn't know whether the vaccine was effective it cannot be unethical to test it on volunteers.<p>But I think you are right to move on to the question of whether it is actually uncertain that the vaccine works.

But it's good, because it made me realize that I've been insensitive in a similar way without knowing it.<p>My brother and I grew up in a rural town of 6,000 in the Midwest. He went off to Harvard and is now a doctor on the West Coast and I went off to Stanford and now run a business in China. We visit home on the holidays. So you can say the article struck a personal note - I'd never read about the pattern before (though I was intuitively aware of it) and knowing that I'm contributing to it leaves me with a sense of melancholy.<p>The point that you miss, jballanc, is that these are communities of living people - each with its own tiny culture. There are problems with these places that I don't know how to solve, but their gradual decay is sad in the same way that the destruction of cultures all over the world is sad.<p>I have to thank you, though. As a foreigner in China whose invested a lot of time in mastering Mandarin, I've come to strongly believe that the elimination of the other Chinese dialects and the traditional character set is a very favorable thing. I've probably said, at some point or another, that I 'really couldn't think of a good reason for the traditional character set to exist anymore'. Until now, I've never been able to fully understand why, for example, some Taiwanese Americans get so upset about the gradual decline of their character set. When speaking to them about the issue, I must have come off as insensitive as you do to me. In the future, I will change my behavior.",1256801332

909626,comment,909025,909499,0,0,10ren,,,"Just BTW: Regarding the time to prepare the article itself, it's standard practice for companies to send press releases to magazines/articles that are already <i>ready for publication as is</i>. It makes sense: they will benefit massively from the publicity, and they have the best access to the material. Who knows, in this case they may even have included the ""too slick"" passage for verisimilitude (with an ironic wink). Most probably, wired did extra work, and just used the press release as a base. I'm just saying that that base reduces the work they had to do.<p>In the long term, quality will improve, in tiny marginal steps. The company already talks about that extra $1 for fact checking; but if another company is doing the same thing, and starts ranking higher, there will be pressure to increase quality. (That is, assuming the ad-clicks are <i>worth</i> fighting for...)<p>It occurs to me that Google's pagerank is out of date: today, few people will add a link to their webpage/blog to one of these $20 videos, so pagerank can't rank them using links.

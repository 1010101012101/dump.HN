Dont invest money on marketing, I have heard horror stories about it, unless you are someone like EA, amazon or target.<p>There are a few dirty tricks that I have noticed being constantly used by other developers like releasing an update as soon as your previous update gets approved to be in the new release section. We don't do that because we are serving a niche market and we don't want to upset users, but it works. (IQ Test by McPhun is amongst top 5 apps in education for last 6 months and they come out with an update every week. They do it for almost all their apps.)",1249430066
742458,comment,741961,742389,0,0,patio11,,,"The key thing to understand is that Conversion Optimizer is just a user-friendly wrapper around cost per click bidding.  It will look to you like you're paying cost per conversion, but you're not, you're paying cost per click.<p>So, if you start ""shaving"" conversions (failing to report them), here is what happens:<p>1)  I tell Google I am willing to pay 25 cents per conversion.  My website converts 25% of clicks, which for the sake of easy math we'll say is constant.  (Conversion Optimizer is a good idea because it is <i>not</i> constant, in particular, because it tends to be different for every source of clicks in ways which are very time-intensive to track yourself.)<p>2)  After Google's system has figured out the above two bits of information, it will figure out ""OK, he can pay about 6.25 cents per click.  In general, I should bid that much on his behalf in the auction -- avoiding clicks priced at 8 cents, and 'backing up the truck' on clicks priced at 4 cents."")<p>3)  Then you start shaving conversions, so that while your site continues to convert at 25%, you only report a conversion rate of 20%.  Google figures ""Wow, sucks to be him, he can only afford clicks priced at 5 cents now and still make his 25 cent per conversion desired price.  OK, I'll stop bidding on clicks between 5 and 6.25 cents, and continue bidding on clicks priced below 5 cents.""<p>Thus, lying to Google doesn't particularly hurt them, it only hurts you.  This is in sharp contrast to real cost per conversion (cost per action = CPA) advertising like affiliate advertising, where you pay for every conversion you report, so shaving conversions means you get money from customers but get to keep it for yourself.",1249430019

742421,comment,741518,741635,0,0,RobGR,,,"I wish to nitpick your discription of the 1930s federal gun law as taking away the ability of most people to own combat firearms.   That law was rather carefully crafted to try to avoid taking away the right to own ""combat"" firearms, because those firearms are exactly the ones to which the 2d amendment would apply.  Rather, it focused on cannons and bombs, which they could argue were not personal arms, and on what it called ""tools of assassination"",  silenced weapons and automatic weapons.   Automatic weapons were not common combat firearms at the time, most soldiers would have rifles that were bolt action, a few semi-automatic.<p>At the time the law was passed the New Dealers were fighting the Supreme Court, which was overturning a lot of their grand plans, so the gun law was crafted with that in mind.  It doesn't even technically ban the ""class III"" weapons, it just requires an excise tax which is difficult to pay.  It is still probably an unconstitutional law, and it's benefits in fighting crime are probably not very big -- the old tommy gun gangsters of the 1930s were not driven out of business by lack of automatic weapons, they were tracked down and killed and arrested by traditional police work (some of which was unconstitutional in other ways).<p>A larger objection I have is to your claim ""we've already mostly lost out ability to enact forceful change.  Those days are gone.""   I think the general trend from 1776 to now, has been towards a more just, more democratic, more ideal society.  There are major deviations on the way, and we are currently regressing, but still ahead of where we were in 1960, I think.<p>I also think robot technology will not always benefit just the rich and powerful in conflicts.  Hobbiests can already build model aircraft which carry a WRT54G and do auto-pilot; when Palestinians hack a cell phone onto a model plane and send a few ounces of incendiary or a grenade on a long, slow trip to be fairly precisely delivered via GPS or cell tower positioning, then you will know the temporary imbalence is ending.",1249428087

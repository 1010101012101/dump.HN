Of course nothing on Earth has completely escaped the influence of man, but no ordinary person thinks a traffic jam is nature.<p>Van Mensvoort wants &quot;nature&quot; to mean &quot;uncontrollable&quot;. This is doubly misleading, because not only does it include traffic jams (in car-favoring political climates like the US), even the most untouched wilderness is in practice controlled, as it only exists thanks to human civilization making laws to preserve it. The definition of &quot;nature&quot; becomes even more politicized than it already is, as whether something can be controlled or not is largely politics.<p>The traditional definition has its problems, but just because there&#x27;s no clear boundary between nature and culture doesn&#x27;t make the distinction meaningless. Van Mensvoort should coin a new word or phrase for his concept.",1447016362

10529873,comment,10529467,10529467,0,0,unabst,,,"1) This comparison to me says more about religion than it does about parenting. Unconditional love and devotion to your baby? The feeling is physical, and the baby is real. To be able to invoke the same feelings for a deity appears more magical to me than parenting, especially for those who have never experienced having a child.<p>2) American parenting isn&#x27;t killing marriage. Marriages are killed one at a time by the unique parents that choose to do so. And that&#x27;s the problem with statistical conceptualizations. It rarely applies to you for those dealing with it at the present. Only in hindsight do the numbers compile anyway, so it really isn&#x27;t all  that helpful.<p>Anyone in a marriage knows that the will to be together is sacrosanct. Once two capable independent adults decide to part ways, nothing could be easier. The past could have been wonderful, and it&#x27;s easy to feel good about what was good. But for many couples, divorce is the choice, and often a good choice for them. In other cultures, there are more bonds holding couples together. In the US, it&#x27;s far easier to be independent or marry again. It&#x27;s easier to live your life on your terms than on that of social perception or social dogma. Is this a good thing? Who are we to judge? If you feel the stats are tilted in the wrong direction, then we can try and tip it the other way with our own marriages. But &quot;for the stats&quot; is not usually what crosses our minds when we&#x27;re not getting along.<p>This is a classic case of &quot;is as does&quot;. Nothing is killing anything. This is the shape of the new American marriage.",1447016293

I occasionally mentor at startup events and I can&#x27;t tell you how crazy it makes me when first-time entrepreneurs look down on getting revenue as some sort of grubby detail not quite worth their attention. I love it when people go after actual customer money; it forces them to pay careful attention to the heart of the business.<p>There is a risk, though. (I&#x27;m sure you know it already, but I mention it just to balance out my enthusiasm for others.) If a company&#x27;s revenue is $0, investors can imagine anything they want. But if revenue is $1.39, investors may be subject to an anchoring bias [1]. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a huge risk for companies that have a well-understood business model; if you are selling annual software subscriptions, it&#x27;s pretty easy for investors to imagine scaling that up. But I think Twitter and Facebook were smart to avoid revenue for a long time because it let them sell the dream.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring</a>",1447016096

This means that instance resolution never depends on ordering of imports, local bindings, or basically anything other than the raw set of available instances, and also any two instances at the same type must be equal. This buys us great scalability and refactorability, most notably in comparison to Scala, where alphabetizing module imports sometimes breaks programs.<p>That said, in category theory one rarely works with vanilla categories but rather other abstractions formulated in categorical language. Similarly, in Haskell vanilla categories aren&#x27;t as useful as the many well-known categorical abstractions (basically, the core Functor - Applicative - Monad hierarchy is directly category-theory inspired, and they&#x27;ve proven to be insanely useful).",1447015440

They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.&quot;<p>&quot;Such a disappearance is a fundamental consequence not of technology, but of human psychology. Whenever\npeople learn something sufficiently well, they cease to be aware of it. When you look at a street sign, for\nexample, you absorb its information without consciously performing the act of reading.. Computer scientist, economist, and Nobelist Herb Simon calls this phenomenon &quot;compiling&quot;; philosopher Michael Polanyi calls it\nthe &quot;tacit dimension&quot;; psychologist TK Gibson calls it &quot;visual invariants&quot;; philosophers Georg Gadamer and\nMartin Heidegger call it &quot;the horizon&quot; and the &quot;ready-to-hand&quot;, John Seely Brown at PARC calls it the\n&quot;periphery&quot;. All say, in essence, that only when things disappear in this way are we freed to use them without\nthinking and so to focus beyond them on new goals.&quot;<p>&quot;How do technologies disappear into the background? The vanishing of electric motors may serve as an\ninstructive example: At the turn of the century, a typical workshop or factory contained a single engine that\ndrove dozens or hundreds of different machines through a system of shafts and pulleys. Cheap, small, efficient\nelectric motors made it possible first to give each machine or tool its own source of motive force, then to put\nmany motors into a single machine.&quot;<p>Mark Weiser on Ubiquitous Computing: [2]<p>&quot;Ubiquitous computing names the third wave in computing, just now beginning. First were mainframes, each shared by lots of people. Now we are in the personal computing era, person and machine staring uneasily at each other across the desktop.

However, since this site is largely geared to hackers AND startup founders, what is its target market and how can they make money off of it?  Or is the object here to be purchased by Google or one of the other sites that have bad HTML editors as their default?",1189931765

We all know that someone has to pay at some point. So ad based models are basically a way to shift that burden around to where it is most easily enforceable or acceptable for the consumer. Since startups are on average less able to enforce rules or gain consumer acceptance, they profit from ad based models more than others.<p>I believe to a large degree, the overuse of ad based business models is the result of not having an effective micro payment system. It doesn't make sense to buy a subscription to every single news site I'm consuming. It's just not practical. It's not even practical to explicitly agree to terms of service. Unfortunately micro payment systems suffer from a huge number of problems. Privacy being  just one of them.",1189929700

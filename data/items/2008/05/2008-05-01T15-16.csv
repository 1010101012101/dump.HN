178550,comment,177865,178138,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The way I'm reading this, our storage capacity today is basically like a bubble wand or a carpenter's level. If you tilt the right side down then the bubble goes all the way up on the left, and if you tilt the left side down then the bubble goes all the way up on the right. This means that bubble wand can hold two values, 0 and 1. With this new process you can essentially tilt the wand a few degrees and have the bubble move only a couple inches and then stop, and then tilt the wand a few more degrees and have the bubble move a little more.<p>In this way you can store any value within a single ""box."" So instead of it taking 64 ""boxes"" to store 64 bits, with this new process we can essentially store this much information in a single box. And furthermore, each box is going to be an order of magnitude smaller than our existing boxes today.<p>This may well be the single most important day of our lives, technologically at least. The singularity is indeed near.",1209657231

178541,comment,178380,178380,0,0,pg,,,"1. A lot more experienced.  Before YC, the only startups I knew
about were the ones started by me and by friends.  Now I know which
of their qualities were essential to their success, and which were
incidental.<p>2. This answer will sound useless, but it's the same reason anyone
is good at anything.  There's no single secret.  There are about
20 different things we have to do, from recognizing talent to talking
about product ideas to matching people up with VCs, and we try hard
to do them all well.<p>3. By accident.  When we first started YC, we didn't know what to
do, so we started with a summer program.  Most college students
regard summer jobs as disposable anyway, so we figured no one would
mind if the experiment was a disaster and all the companies failed.
As it turned out, that batch did remarkably well.<p>4. This one I already did write about: <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/about.html</a><p>5. That it's not as easy as it looks.  A lot of people think investing
is like betting on horses: you pick, they race, and if they win you
get money.  Actually it is a lot more active than that.  And the
earlier the stage, the more work it is.  If you want to invest at
this stage, you need to have the same qualities you'd need to be a
successful founder.",1209656726

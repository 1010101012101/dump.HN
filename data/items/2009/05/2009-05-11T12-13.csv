603374,comment,603301,603358,0,0,jleyank,,,"No, I think even though it was early in the morning I said what I wanted to say.  We need professionals, not amateurs, in the programming biz.  Whether they're professional engineers, artists or whatever, we need people who approach the problem seriously, do the best work they can and make sure to finish the odds and ends that make good code.  There's far too much ""slap it together"" code dragging down both the user's experience and our collective reputation.<p>One can be a professional artist as well as a professional engineer.  I prefer the former generating visualizations and the latter doing operating systems.  But I really want the #!~!&@$~! to work.",1242046314

603370,comment,603141,603266,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Not really, most of that post is FUD from cable competitors in the US (ADSL and fibre-to-the-home providers). I'm not sure how much of it even applies to Virgin Media as their network has a great deal of fibre-optics in it, though not the last mile.<p>The part about home equipment, where the falling standards of Ars journalism really shows, is just restating ""640K is enough for anyone"" repeatedly, to the point of absurdity. It appears that to actually have a computer connected physically to the internet via ethernet is some wacky use case and the very thought of providing internet access faster than an 11b wireless router is crazy talk.<p>In the UK it is the ADSL providers that market misleadingly, they all use weaselly ""up to X Mbp/s"" language, and for maximum speed you need to be physically located near to the exchange, it drops the further away you are.<p>Virgin Media have consistently provided whatever you pay for, even as it has increased from less than 1Mbps to 2, 5, 10, 20 and now as we speak 50Mbp/s is in the middle of deployment. I see no reason for their talked about 100 and 200 Mbp/s rollouts to be any different.<p>A bigger issues is when can they roll them out to the whole country as they always talk about the next big step publicly before having to deal with the very real problem of bringing the whole network up to the level neeeded. By the time it arrives there will be some who can take advantage of it, those who can't or don't want to will be able to pay less for lower tiers of service, generally the stick to three tiers and users on the bottom tier gets bumped up for free, which probably has a big impact on usage too depending on the ratio of users on different plans.<p>That's not to say Virgin don't have various other things you could complain about but it seems unfair to complain about misleading speed numbers when that is something that (at least from a UK perspective) they are on the right side of.",1242046060

603346,comment,602531,602531,0,0,Ardit20,,,"<i>it’s only journalism that’s essential to a functioning democracy</i><p>Yet<p><i>Stephen Colbert, appearing at the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, delivered a monologue accusing his hosts of being stenographers who had, in essence, let the Bush White House get away with murder (or at least the war in Iraq).</i><p>How is such journalism protecting democracy when it can not hold accountable its government when it matters the most. These papers are hardly journalism they are the establishment and this is clearly shown by: <i>Colbert’s routine did not kill. The Washington Post reported that it “fell flat.” The Times initially did not even mention it. But to the Beltway’s bafflement, Colbert’s riff went viral overnight,</i> Clearly therefore it seems that newspapers are not doing their job of informing the public and the public seems to find the information without their help. Hence if newspapers die then so be it. Their upholding of the spirit of democracy is only empty rhetorics when the actions show that they do nothing of the sort. Their drums of death to democracy if they die is utter hypocrisy when looking at the facts. When there is a void to be filled I doubt there will not be brave journalists to fill it without the help of the newspapers.<p>P.S Funny huh, yesterday we read about Murdoch wanted to charge for papers, today we read a propaganda piece exactly to convince people to pay. I would not pay for New York Times and the sooner they die the better not least because their boss seems to have the power to meet with any leader he wishes promptly.

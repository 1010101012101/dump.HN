<i>studies [show] that a lack of stimulation ... retards cognitive development.</i><p>What studies are those? Would you consider being locked 24 hours, seven days a week, in a dark attic with a deaf-mute mother, and no toys, to be adequate stimulation for a developing child? The child rescued from that situation turned out to have mentally-developed normally, including having a normal IQ. Read all about it, and other cases of rescue from severe adversity, here: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Early+Experience+and+the+Life+Path%22+attic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Early+Experience+and+the+L...</a><p><pre><code>  .

Jensen discusses the case of Isabelle (reported by Clarke and Clarke) on page 113 of the g Factor:<p><i>From birth to age six, Isabel [sic] was totally confined to a dim attic room, where she lived alone with her deaf-mute mother who was her only social contact. Except for food, shelter, and the presence of her mother, Isabel was reared in what amounted to a totally deprived environment. There were no toys, picture books, or gadgets of any kind for her to play with. When found by the auothorities, at age six, Isabel was tested and found to have a mental age of one year and seven months and an IQ of about 30, which is barely at the imbecile level. In many ways she behaved like a very young child; she had no speech and made only croaking sounds. When handed toys or other unfamiliar objects, she would immediately put them in her mouth, as infants normally do. Yet as soon as she was exposed to educational experiences, she acquired speech, vocabulary, and syntax at an astonishing rate and gained six years of tested mental age within just two years. By the age of eight, she had come up to a mental age of eight, and her level of achievement in school was on a par with her age-mates. ... She graduated from high school as an average student.<p>What all this means ... is that the neurological basis of information processing continued developing autonomously throughout the six years of Isabel's environmental deprivation, so that as soon as she was exposed to a normal environment she was able to learn those things for which she was developmentally ""ready"" at an extraordinarily fast rate, far beyond the rate for typically reared children over the period of six years over which their mental age normally increases from two to eight years. But the fast rate of manifest mental development slowed down to an average rate at the point where the level of mental development caught up with the level of neurological development. Clearly, the rate of mental development during childhood ... is largely based on the maturation of neural structures.</i>",1223052613
322812,comment,322778,322778,0,0,dpatru,,,"It took me a while to understand how he built the doubly linked list. Here's my explanation.<p>You want to build a function which takes two doubly linked lists (DLList) and some values and inserts the values in between the lists and returns the starting and ending nodes of the new DDList. Call the function go.<p><pre><code>  go leftDLList values rightDLList -> (start, stop)
</code></pre>
Now start and stop will end up being the original boundaries: RightDLList will be the DLList node which contains the first inserted element, and leftDLList will contain the last inserted element. Thus when we run out of elements to insert, just return the starting and stopping nodes. In Haskell:<p>go startingN [] stoppingN = (stoppingN, startingN)<p>If we haven't run out of values, then we simply build a new DLList node for the first value, and recurse with the new node as the first node.<p><pre><code>  go prev (x:xs) next = (this, last)
    where this = DLNode prev x rest
          (rest, last) = go this xs next
</code></pre>
That's it! now we just call go with starting and ending nodes which we haven't defined.<p><pre><code>  (first, last) = go last (x:xs) first

</code></pre>
Because Haskell is lazy, it doesn't try to evaluate last and first until it needs to. The recursive call to go will bind first to (DLNode last x rest). Last will be bound when the base case definition of go is called. By that time go is called with a real DLNode as it's first argument.",1223052490

322805,story,,,3,1,tstegart,"Can a micropayment strategy make money?",,"So I'm bouncing ideas for business plans around, and one of them involves selling low-cost digital goods. Basically, an online store would sell goods priced at $.99 and the consumer would pay by credit card. I know a place like the iTunes Store makes money doing the same thing, but on a massive scale. They also have an advantage in that many times the actual purchase is higher than $.99, because purchases over time are lumped together and a consumer often makes multiple purchases.<p>But is it viable for a business that would sell small quantities of goods, resulting in a credit card charge of $2 or less? Is there any profit at all in a credit card transaction of $.99? Disregarding the overhead for a merchant account for the time being, what are the transaction costs for a credit card transaction, and what is a good estimate of the available margin left over to spread amongst the interested parties? An example: I sell a digital picture for $.99. How much will I have left over after credit card fees to split with the copyright owner?",1223051941

5347656,comment,5347368,5347368,8,0,cmccabe,,,"It makes me sad that Canonical is doing so many things to split the community.  First they stuck to upstart, after everyone else moved over to systemd.  Then, they decided to snub GNOME3 in order to create a new windowing environment called Unity.  Now, they're trying to build their own copy of Wayland, codenamed Mir.  Ubuntu still uses bzr, when most of the rest of the world uses git.<p>I guess maybe this was inevitable.  They wanted to differentiate themselves from Red Hat and similar distros that were using the ""normal"" stack.  But do we really need so many duplicate projects, so many of which seem to be duds?<p>Ultimately, Ubuntu wants to be Android.  And it never will be, because Canonical doesn't have Google's engineering or financial resources, or a business model that would support such an undertaking.  I understand the idealism, but as they say, ""hope is a good breakfast, but a poor supper.""<p>I feel like Ubuntu's decision to include adware like the Amazon toolbar is the first of many such decisions.\nUltimately, they have to make a profit, and they're going to have to turn to ""traditional methods.""  The traditional method for PC OEMs to make a profit is-- let's be honest here-- crapware.  I fear that this is going to blacken the name of Linux for a lot of people.  Already a lot of people think that ""Linux"" can't do suspend or hibernate properly, because Ubuntu often can't.  Soon people are going to think that ""Linux"" is full of adware and spyware, simply because Ubuntu is.  Sigh.",1362811521

Of course it is configurable. I would strongly advise you to do this as well.<p>yes I'm glad we had this discussion so that I've learned PG has this handy command.   We can't do it by default because it's a PG-only behavior and I don't have an analogue for all the other databases, but we can add it to the Postgresql dialect documentation as a recommended addition for apps that are modifying session state.<p>> As for idle connections, Postgresql uses a process-per-connection model, and therefore idle connections use a fair amount of resources, and having too many connections can have other bad consequences for performance. (Too many is generally considered to be more than 100.)<p>If I'm going over 100 connections for a single PG database, which is not something that occurs with the typical medium-size web applications I work with (they are more like in the 20 connection range), then I'd use PGBouncer.

However, if I were configuring SQLAlchemy, I would just use the NullPool.<p>Probably not, though I'd want to see what kind of overhead psycopg2 has starting up connections and such, I think it's not much.

5347597,comment,5345577,5347508,1,0,zzzeek,,,"Edit: apparently as I finished typing this, the parent post edited itself out...though there's some decent info about how to reset sessions here.  I'll take the more heated quotes/responses out.<p>>   However, lets say you use the SQLAlchemy pool's overflow setting. In that case, new connections will be made as needed, except they will be discarded as they go back to the pool, if the pool has 10 back in it already. Since connections aren't shared between processes, this means many, many new connections will be made and discarded, adding a sizable amount of extra load to a database server already heavily taxed by the high level of traffic.<p>That's the key, that the app is going to be using N number of connections constantly, and the ""max overflow"" is used for spikes. Nothing is stopping you from combining the in app pools with PGBouncer if you're optimizing for this particular case.  There's nothing wrong with PGBouncer.   But there's also nothing wrong with in-app pools.<p>>  Nothing, the PGBouncer solution is superior in every respect.<p>the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.<p>>> The pool emits the ROLLBACK whether or not the application did so. Problem solved.<p>> 2. Really? When did you add this feature?<p>in 2007.  Were you using SQLAlchemy in version 0.2 or 0.3 or something?  That would be pretty unfortunate, it was more or less alpha software at that time.<p>>  I see it, it is called reset_on_return, and was added to SQLAlchemy in version 0.7.6, which was released in 2012.<p>You are incorrect.  reset_on_return is a setting that allows the behavior to be <i>configurable</i> - before that, it was on in all cases.  Users of MySQL with MyISAM wanted to turn it off as they weren't using transactions anyway and it was taking up time they didn't want to spend.<p>> Also, ROLLBACK is completely insufficient here, as things like temporary tables, query planner variable changes, and many other very common things persist on the SESSION level.<p>Those are unusual and exotic cases, which if one were using (haven't seen too many web apps that create temporary tables) would have to be planned for.   If someone really wants to make session level changes, we have an event system by which those changes can be reset when the connection's state is finished.  I've gone and checked PGBouncer's documentation - they deal with it in exactly the same way, which is that you need to set up your own query using ""server_reset_query"".<p>> Additionally, SQLAlchemy doesn't check that the database connection is valid before letting it out of the pool, just when it is returned.<p>by default this would waste a lot of time.  But if you want to do that, here is the documentation to enable that feature: <a href=""http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/core/pooling.html#disconnect-handling-pessimistic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/core/pooling.html#disc...</a><p>>  If the database is restarted, SQLAlchemy will gladly hand you database 'connections' where the TCP connection has been closed.<p>if you're not using pessimistic handling (which most people don't), you will get at most one of these. the entire pool is flushed when this condition is detected.<p>> Right. Or you could just use something like PGBouncer, and not have to do this. Also, PGBouncer will have it's connections pooled and ready to go across application restarts, forks, whatever.<p>so use PGBouncer as well.  Nothing is wrong with PGBouncer, it's simply not universally necessary.<p>> That is something that has never come up for me, and honestly I think it is YAGNI.<p>honestly that's what I think about your entire first paragraph, the vast majority of apps don't really need that level of detailed tuning.  The app servers all hold onto a handful of connections, make some new ones as needed, and it works just fine.  But I won't say that your scenario doesn't have merit, partially because it's too late at night for me to parse all that and it's obvious that very high performance scenarios can benefit from having more automation at more levels, nobody is saying PGBouncer is a bad product.  I've just never had to bother installing/starting/configuring a whole new daemon just to have a medium size web application run adequately.<p>> Well, there are a bunch of issues: worse performance, many more database connections that just sit idle (doesn't matter with mysql, matters a lot with postgres),<p>If the applications are idle, then you'd have idle connections, but I haven't experienced that being an issue - the database is idle too !    If you have some servers spiking and other ones idling, then its an issue, so use PGBouncer for that case.   But that's not typical in my experience.",1362809557

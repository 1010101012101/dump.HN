162245,comment,161927,162201,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I have used ""real"" package management, both on Linux and Mac OS X, and for native Mac OS X applications it's largely unnecessary. I rarely run into OS X apps that require I install a bunch of dependencies, and most OS X applications these days check for updates on their own. For those that don't there's AppFresh: <a href=""http://metaquark.de/appfresh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metaquark.de/appfresh/</a><p>However, I do agree the method ""fails miserably when what you are installing is not an application."" MacPorts and Fink are decent solutions, though I admit they could be much better.",1208064733

162243,comment,162066,162231,0,0,zkinion,,,"Your putting too much faith in the buyers of ads reacting to the changes in prices and knowing exactly how much the traffic they are buying is actually worth.  <i>All</i> mortgage broker's/free i-pod scam/dating site/etc know the exact ROI they get back from each and every little bit of traffic?  No way.  In some industries, theres even a bunch of buyers, some less sophisticated than others, but are yet still able to buy the traffic at a certain rate because they are making a profit at that rate.  That isn't optimization.  In industries with fewer buyers (high traffic dating sites), one site might have to purchase traffic from a multitude of different sources, or indirectly purchasing it from their own affiliates who might purchase it themselves, to keep up their market share against other big competitors.<p>This isn't about spotting temporary market inefficiencies, its about spotting long term ones that lurk beneath the surface.",1208064520

When you find someone who's a good wingman, things just click.<p>I can understand you're concern about getting matched poorly but the experience I had with pair programming is that there is a much greater chance you'll end up working well together and a much smaller chance than you might imagine that things don't work out.<p>In fact, you could say that pair programming is a great way to develop that rapport with a coworker.  It's not just good for the company because the work is done better, I think it's good for you as a person, because people no matter how introverted are really wired to be social.<p>If someone were really just a toad and would be worse than useless as a partner, chances are that same kind of person won't want to do pair programming with you anyhow.",1208064112

But, with Berkshire, almost all of its investments thrive well on their own.  Buffett invests in each and every one because of fundamental reasons within each individual company.<p>My argument is that some companies are making a lot more money off of each traffic batch than the traffic batch is actually worth.  By figuring out such companies, the value of the traffic to facebook would then be higher.  Would this work with every company that advertises on FB?  No.  Could it might possibly maybe work with at least one or two companies?  Yes.<p>Saying any company with a non-functioning business model should just do something else is really stretching it.  I believe FB does have a functioning business model that could use a great deal of improvement.  This, to me, could be such an improvement.  What other alternatives are there?  You have already said yourself that things like ""social graphs"" are just BS meant to inflate valuations to $15 billion.",1208063689

162233,comment,161980,162094,0,0,vlad,,,"From what I understand, the matte screen is a glossy screen before it's coated with an anti-reflective material.  Supposedly, some consumers saw ""unfinished"" displays at a computer show and liked them, and manufacturers noticed that customers were more apt to purchase shiny laptops.  Given the difference in reflectivity between such displays in different laptops, I deduce that glossy screens do have some anti-reflective coating, just not as much as matte.",1208063576
162232,comment,162213,162213,0,0,yters,,,"I always took it for granted economists believed people's attitude had a significant influence on the market.  In fact, this is probably why they say the opposite, so people don't go crazy.  Similar to how telling people they don't have free will makes them more complacent.<p>Interesting how the feedback loop goes both ways so reality resembles what people say.  An argument can seem self fulfilling.<p>However, this is not po-mo in the sense that reality is what people think it is, though, because people don't really lose their free will.",1208063407
162231,comment,162066,162226,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"No, I'm assuming that they could just buy ads with the same ROI in many places. For instance, if Facebook ads cost 20 cents cpm, but they earn 40 cents, then their ROI is 2x. I would assume they would have no trouble finding ads elsewhere with a 2x ROI. In fact, I'd be surprised if the market didn't function to make their ads be a 2x ROI at MySpace, Bebo, Hi5, and maybe Digg, Reddit, etc.<p>Spotting market inefficiencies like that should be really hard to do, considering that all of the mortgage brokers, for instance, already know their ROI on various sites, and the market will make it roughly equal everywhere over time.",1208063100

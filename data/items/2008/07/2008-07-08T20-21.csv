I became very apathetic; being at the bottom of the seniority roster and thinking to myself, ""This is what I have to look forward to for the next 40 years."" really did me in.  That's why I've decided to do a startup -- perhaps I'm being idealistic, but I think I can enjoy what I would consider a better quality of life in that sort of environment.<p>""I have idea's in my head but can't seem to think them out into a good project.""<p>Do you have anyone to bounce them off of?  Say, an old friend from school?  I'm in Minnesota and one of my project's co-founders is California, but we've kept in contact since school and tossed around a lot of interesting ideas in that time.

He shows a piece of code that uses a regular expression over implicitly-defined variables.<p>I agree that's confusing; regex syntax is <i>very</i> terse, and there's nothing in there to help you learn it.  (In regular code, variable and function names can help you infer from context what the other constructs do.)  Secondly, it's hard to reason about code that does things that aren't written.  ""while(<>)"" assigning to ""$_"" for ""/.../"" to use is confusing.  $2 and $3 coming out of nowhere are confusing.<p>The problem, though, is not with Perl; it's with the author's lack of knowledge of how it works.  Regexes are nice once you learn them.  Operating on $_ is nice once you expect that to happen.  $1 and friends are quite handy.<p>Finally, most Perl apps don't look like this.  Sure, there may be something like this hidden over in an obscure subroutine, but most Perl looks like every other language.<p>Here's a randomly sampling of Perl from my git repository:<p><a href=""http://git.jrock.us/?p=Template-Refine.git;a=blob;f=lib/Template/Refine/Fragment.pm;hb=HEAD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.jrock.us/?p=Template-Refine.git;a=blob;f=lib/Temp...</a><p>Basically, it looks like it would when written in any other language.  It's not unreadable or crazy, it's just a program.<p>Finally, here's a more readable version of his example:<p><pre><code>    while ( my $line = <> ){ # or ""readline"" if you hate <>
        while( $line =~ /<!--(?<comment_body>[^-]+)/g ){
            say $+{comment_body};

One more thing; from the article:<p><i>Even so, I supect that most readers that know both languages, even Perl fans, will agree with me.</i><p>Not true.  I don't know Python, so of course I'm not going to be able to use it to write maintainable code.  I do know Perl, though, and I bet I can write much better code than the author of this article.<p>I should note that his program doesn't actually work.  It won't work across lines, and doesn't allow ""-"" in the comment.  A full-file parser would do a correct job, and one is available from the CPAN, so it would involve less code anyway.",1215550055

The difference here is not drastic in this short example but in functions with 50+ lines of code it's very clear.<p>The average person's short term memory is only 5 - 7 items deep. 3 of those slots are already occupied with what they are doing, so you have 2 slots left, maybe 4 slots if they've had their coffee and are really paying attention. Every time you make a code indent, whether it be a loop or nested condition, then you're asking the reader to remember that context switch. Once you have indenting more than two tabs deep then you're in hazy territory where the reader is unlikely to remember all of the conditions that lead to those lines of code being executed.",1215549908

677886,comment,677381,677471,0,0,psranga,,,"Remember that modern civilization <i>ENABLES</i> many people to attain high positions. So I would not consider this expectation to be totally unrealistic. There are <i>SO</i> many ways in which to excel and influence society in the modern world that there is room for many many many (maybe all of us) to be near the top of something or other.<p>One example from the work world: all decent companies have a technical and management ladder so that people who are not completely aggressive can still influence strategy (e.g., Anders Hejlsberg?).<p>And with food/clothing/shelter becoming less and and scarce as time passes, being at the ""top"" is going to matter less and less.",1246211951

A sort of hot one is boring, and no one, not even the geeks will talk about it.</i><p>Hot-hot-hot sauce <i>is</i> dumbing down your product.  What about flavor?  Reaching for yet higher levels of capsaicin content is simple, the result primitive.  A complex, well balanced flavor is much harder to achieve, and has a much higher reward.  (And less excess discomfort the day after.)<p>I'm a geek and not even particularly knowledgeable about hot sauces, but still, let me <i>talk about</i> Baron's hot sauce.  Very plain label.  Good treatment of the aged peppers.  Tasteful addition of a strong garlic note.  IMO, wonderfully flavorful.  In contrast, there's ""Heinie Hurtin Hot Sauce,"" which has good comic traction for marketing.  Colorful cartoon on the bottle.  Nothing remarkable in the bottle, IMO.  (No, I'm not an expert, all of this comes from eating at a neighborhood burrito place with a selection of 6 hot sauces at any time.)<p>As always, appealing to the wannabe segment of the fringe is easier, because they have a shaky grasp of the fundamentals and therefore are easier to manipulate with shallow marketing.  (The guys who reach for ""Heinie Hurtin"" for the bragging rights.)  The clueful part of the fringe is much harder to reach.<p>Semblance is easy.  Substance is hard.",1246211880

677868,comment,677714,677714,0,0,robotrout,,,"A lot of it seems to be tricky math.  It's not MPG, it's MPGe, the 'e' is for 'equivalent'.  However, marketing guys have been playing those games forever, so no surprises there.<p>They're claiming E85 has 1/3rd less energy than gas, so they're actually getting 110*0.66 = 72.5 mpg of E85.<p>72.5 mpg is not as good for marketing hype, but it's still impressive.<p>He seems to be playing some games with the acceleration profile as well.  If you 'gun it', you're in 'power mode', not 'efficiency mode', so the mpg numbers no longer apply.  I'm not certain if this is common practice or not in these kinds of tests.  It probably is.<p>I think he is mainly just taking control of the throttle away from the driver, and doing a ""throttle by wire' system, giving you the most efficient (and probably painfully unresponsive) acceleration profile possible, when you're in 'efficiency mode'.  I'm not sure if that buys him the whole 72.5mpg or not, but it's in his toolbox.  <EDIT: Actually I can imagine such a system that wouldn't be too bad.  When the user makes relatively small acceleration addition requests with the throttle pedal, you use your efficiency optimized acceleration profile to give it to him.  When the user ""stomps on it"", because a truck is about to hit him, then you give him the requested throttle amount.  I can imagine such a system would yield efficiency gains without being too painful to drive.</EDIT><p>Whether there's something else in the engine that gives you the rest of the efficiency gains, or if that's all of it, remains to be seen.<p>Of course, we don't know if any of this is real, but if it is, it's a cross between ""real"" and ""marketing real"".",1246211024

In that respect I don't care how that service is provided and on what technology that is based. It could be a giga-cluster of retrofitted Commodore 64s thrown out in orbit to save on real estate costs, kept in place by a reinforced fiber back down to Google HQ. As long as the service works, I wouldn't care less.<p>This gives google complete freedom in their implementation, so they pretty much built up their own infrastructure from scratch, for a very specific purpose.<p>Microsoft on the other side delivers software, general purpose platforms which you can deploy and build your own solutions on. Granted, they got the whole internet thing a little late, but I can't blame them for trying to exploit the technology they already posses instead of ditching it all and starting from scratch.<p>With Microsoft's solutions, I know I can make them do whatever I want, on pretty much any x86 hardware, and I know it will work. ""Google OS"", for a lack of better name, I doubt would be particularly useful for the general public.<p>I don't think it's surprising for a platform tailored for one specific goal to perform better than general purpose platforms in that specific area, but that hardly means that the other platform is worthless.",1246208547

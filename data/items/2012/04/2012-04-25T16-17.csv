If that is not for you, do not work there.<p>But, having worked in a couple of call centers, I feel obliged to point out not all of them are that way.  I have been in call centers for major products where there were no scripts, the representatives (or ""agents"") were expected to think and help solve problems for the customers as well as provide feedback to other departments making the products.  But I will agree those are a minority and in some call centers they are separated out into ""level 2"" or something equivalent.",1335373176

Even if I could wave this wand over your body and cure you from cancer, chances are I couldnt sell it to hospitals""<p>The core problem is, big manufacturers offer discounts (or bigger kickbacks) for bundling. A niche product is unlikely to succeed, even if it's obviously better. A product that has pros and cons is not going to have a chance.<p>Also, I'd imagine that a detached needle could be a greater legal liability than an infection. It's easy to prove that a needle detached in a patients arm. It's a lot harder to prove that an infection was caused by a needle without safeguards. ""First, do absolutely no harm for which you can be sued for"" is not a great creed, but it's one some hospitals will follow.<p>If you're a supplier, perhaps you're best shot is to license to a big manufacturer, to break in, even if you're capable of producing and marketing your product; because you'll be locked out of the supply stream if you go it alone. That's a pretty sad state of affairs.",1335373174

3889876,comment,3888928,3888928,2,0,lazy8,,,"I work 7 days a week very consistently at my startup, but I don't put in many hours in a given day. I'm too embarrassed to say exactly how many hours. I take breaks when I feel tired or frustrated, and if a problem comes up in the afternoon that I don't know how to solve, I quit for the day. Usually I will be able to solve it in the morning.<p>I worry sometimes about whether I am working hard enough, so recently I started doing some time tracking to see where I am spending my time. I looked around for software and decided on the Web application toggl.com. All you do is write down what you are doing, and the software logs the time. Really though you could do the same thing with a spreadsheet or a piece of paper.<p>It's harder than it sounds to be honest about what you are doing, and why you are doing it. I have spent a bunch of time on Hacker News this morning reading posts and writing this. Is that productive, or is it just infotainment? It's hard to say. I wonder if the author of that article counted the time spend writing the post and responding to people as a part of work hours. Why or why not?<p>I haven't been doing time tracking very long, but I have found that sometimes there is this period of time at the beginning of doing something where I haven't really gotten into the task yet, and I feel like ""Oh man I'm <i>working!</i> This is a drag."" That feeling peaks maybe after 20 minutes or so. I find that if I'm able to keep working, I start feeling better, and then after an hour or so I feel fine, like ""This is what I'm doing. It's comfortable. I could do more.""<p>So I think that maybe sometimes I quit too early, and I could actually be doing more without feeling stressed or overwhelmed. But I think there are limits to how much you can push, and you have to be really gentle with yourself. Because if you force yourself too much, you get burned out and then it becomes very difficult to even get started on work. You can go days or weeks at a time getting almost nothing done.<p>I'm also studying a foreign language at the moment, and I think it is really important to study every day. Over on the language forum I visit, lots of people talk about how many flash card reps they do, and it's almost always more than what I do. What I do seems insignificant, both in terms of reviews and new cards per day. I feel it is another example of how I don't work hard enough, and I don't have enough discipline.<p>But I think the only real way to fail at foreign language study is to quit, so I hope that keeping my standards for serious study low and spending more time on fun stuff like reading comics and watching TV shows in the language, I will be able to stick with it. I haven't missed a day in over 6 months, but it's going to take years to get to fluency. It's a long process.<p>I hope working at a startup is similar. I hope it's just a matter of making progress every day, and not giving up. I hope it's not a competition over who can work the most hours. If it is, I'm afraid I will probably lose.",1335372647

Because as hack writers go, his academic qualifications are better than most.  He's an intelligent guy, and it seems fair to give at least some weight to his opinion.  Equally, it seems unfair to presume a priori that he's not a good source of information. At the least, you'd should argue ""He's looney about X, which we all agree is false, therefore we should not trust him on Y"".   Simply saying ""He's looney about X"" doesn't add much information and merely pits your authority against his.<p>I agree with your summary of computer models, and your basic  judgement of climate scientists, but fear that many of the influential climate science papers don't adhere to this standard.  Frequently the technique is to tweak the parameters of a number of models until each creates ""realistic"" results, generate a small number (1-3) of simulations with each model, and then create an unweighted average of this ensemble so that the high and low estimates cancel.  The meaning of this is much harder to interpret than the case where all the models predict a similar outcome with identical inputs.<p><a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/347.htm#tab91"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/347.htm#tab91</a><p>----<p>CRICHTON, (John) Michael.

In reality the computer market is broken into a number of distinct markets that have overlap and some of these are more lucrative than others.<p>Pricing structure will make a difference here, I wonder if the Linux games will be the same price as their Windows counterparts? I remember a few years ago there were a number of companies that tried to break into Linux gaming but the prices for the games were astronomical. Many 5 year old games that could have had for Windows for about $10 were selling for $40+ on Linux.<p>Linux Steam could also focus on other styles of games too, perhaps there is more demand amongst Linux users for highly cerebral RTS & RPG games rather than the latest COD that could be sold at a higher price? All you would really need is one or two ""killer"" titles that were Linux exclusive (think XBoX and Halo) to make whole categories of gamers take it seriously. Of course it is both a blessing and a curse in the sense that stuff developed for Linux is often easier to port to other platforms than the other way around.<p>As a Desktop Linux user myself I am not too concerned with ""market share"" , to an extent I couldn't care less if I am the only the person that uses it.

The (small subset of) professional statisticians I've spoken to are both similarly suspicious of climate models (not climate change itself), though for more technical reasons than you mention.<p>At the same time, the physics dictate that the general sign and order of magnitude of CO2 forcing in climate models is correct, as surely as doubling solar output would increase mean surface temperatures. The physics also don't preclude the effects being even more severe than the models predict. But there's considerable uncertainty involved in both directions, and when people hear ""well, things might end up better than scientists think is the average case, and at no cost to us!"" they jump for that option and ignore the average prediction, let alone the worst case scenario that's within plausibility.<p>Coupled with an extremely well-funded group of fossil fuel industrialists putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the outright shutting down of climate research, good scientists and especially not-at-all-scientific activists end up on the defensive, overemphasizing the finality of the models and using them as solid predictions instead of tools to vindicate the general thrust of the physics.<p>As far as your particular point, think of the the models in climate journals as tools to understand the issue instead of the final word. It is somewhere between very difficult and impossible to come up with a climate model where CO2 forcing doesn't cause significant warming, but individual parts of those models need to be and often are tested.

I know that it's not super difficult to get Django running off an EC2 server, and unless your server is doing anything particularly complicated, you can probably get away with using Micro instances which are free for light use.
Also, costs of scale are one of those ""good problems"" to have, since if you're getting to the point where you have enough traffic to be expensive, you'll have a much (relatively) easier time raising capital to fund your ongoing operations.",1335371328

I can't vouch for this but I remember reading posts about such things maybe a year ago.<p>It's not necessarily about loosing data or loosing GDrive alone.  There are many scenarios one could think of.  Firstly, if your account gets locked out you loose ALL Google services. If you've been using Gmail for years, it's gone.  Documents? Gone.  Everything Google, gone.  It doesn't matter if you are paying for the service or not.  It's gone and you have virtually no recourse.<p>One possible GDrive scenario (of the many one could imagine) is that of someone going on a family trip and uploading photos to GDrive during the trip to make room on their flash card.  Somewhere along their Google account is suspended because of, well, who knows?  All of their photos are gone.<p>Business trip.  Upload your presentation and other materials to GDrive.  Travel light. Account suspended by the time you get to your destination.  Screwed.<p>With GDrive storage options reaching terabytes there will be many instances of people relying on GDrive for primary storage. That can certainly be the case with Google Docs, where the documents themselves are created online as well.<p>Clearly this is not an issue for the vast majority of Google account holders.  This is due to the fact that account suspensions are more widely reported for users of AdSense and AdWords.  In other words, business users.  Your average Google user would not (and should not) have this problem.  This is good for average consumers yet bad in that there might not be enough of an incentive for Google to be compelled to change their ways and be more reasonable with business users.

Of course anyone who runs the same program gets the same results, so ordinary replication is pointless--instead you answer the same question with a totally different program and see if your answer is close.<p>And then, of course, you wait and see if the predictions of the models come true.  You can't reset the world and re-test it, but you can re-run the models and ask for more prediction in the future and wait some more.<p>Climate scientists do both of those things all the time because they're in one of the most heavily scrutinized fields.<p>Isolating variables just means you compare two setups with everything the same except one.  That's actually one of the things the models are for.  You can't re-run the world without humans, but you can re-run the model with humans turned off.<p>Then someone else can do the same with their totally different model. And if both of your answers match reality with humans on and each other with humans off, well maybe the difference between humans on and humans off is the impact of humans.  Or maybe not.  But adding more different models helps.<p>In short: climate science generates testable hypotheses, does replication, and isolates variables.  It's possible they're wrong (and publishing source code is a good idea) but they don't have a methodology problem.  And they're probably right.<p>Also, Michael Crichton basically wrote Hollywood scripts in novel form. He's not a good source on anything.",1335369783

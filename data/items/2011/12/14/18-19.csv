But if that were the case, you'd expect banks in general to be more profitable.<p>Your bank is in the business of figuring out how likely you are to repay loans. They'll probably <i>ask</i> you these questions, since answering them makes you a better customer. But refusing to answer puts you in a low credit-rating bucket.<p>Banks already use your transactions to figure out how creditworthy you are. If you want to avoid that, you can do all your business in cash, but you will pay for it if you ever want a mortgage. All they're doing is offering you the option: if your privacy is worth, say, 2% per year on a $100K mortgage, then go ahead. But for lots of people, privacy has value, but not an infinitely high value.<p>You can argue that it's unfair for your desire for privacy to imply that you have something to hide. But if you do, better blame the people who do have something to hide and claim that they just believe in privacy: if such people didn't exist, you <i>would</i> be able to maintain your privacy at a much lower cost.<p>Maybe you could use a real-world example. Let's say you're hiring an employee, and your employee casually mentions that he changed his name last year. ""What was your original name?"" ""Not telling."" ""Did you do anything that would give you a good reason to change your name?"" ""Not telling."" ""Can you tell me who you used to work for under your previous name, and why you're no longer there?"" ""Ugh. Stop trying to violate my privacy. Just assume that I have good reasons not to tell you information that you would use to make a reasonable decision; it's totally unfair to lump me in with people who would do that to cover up something terrible they've done, or some unsavory associations they have.

3353001,comment,3349431,3349431,3,0,my137,,,"Instead of comparing the equity of the first engineer with the founders, it is easier to compare how much his lower salary can buy him if he takes another job with full salary and invest the difference in the company as an angel investor. If there is an engineer whose salary is $120k/year and is joining a startup at $90K/year, he is taking a 30k/year loss. Let's say the startup has received $500K investment at the valuation of $2.5M. Since the startup has passed its valuation point already, its current value is somewhere between 2.5M and its future expected value.<p>Let's assume the prediction for valuation at the next round is $10M and there is 50% chance that the company gets there. This would make the value of the company about $5M at this point. This means that the engineer's discounted salary is worth about 0.6% equity (30K/5M=0.6%) for the company. Usually companies make the offer for 4 years worth of equity with a vesting plan. Again it is not correct to multiply 0.6 by 4 because the salary of engineer will reach to its market value after the next round of funding. It is fair to multiply it by 2x. This brings the total equity given to the engineer to be about 1.2%. I made a few assumptions here such as what the expected value of the startup would be in the next round of funding and how much the salary is lower than the market value. This calculation shows that the current amount of equity offered to the first employees is not that different from what it should be contrary to what the author of the blog post has suggested.<p><i>To offer a simple formula:</i><p>Y (expected equity of the first employee for the first year) = X (loss in income for the first year) / V (valuation at the next round of funding) * P (probability of the startup getting to the next round).<p><i>For our example:</i><p>Y = 30K / 10M * 0.5 = 0.6%<p>I know engineers often compare themselves to the founders and wonder why they should get so much less equity considering that they have similar skills and are putting equal effort into the company. One thing they ignore is that what founders have already put in. In most typical startups, the founders have been developing the idea at least for two years and have worked full-time on the startup for 6 to 12 months before receiving the seed funding. They have done this at the time that the possibility of getting to the seed funding round was less than 20%.<p>If we assume their market value was $120K/year, that means they each put in something about $120K at the time that there was less than 20% chance that the company would get to the point of $2.5M valuation. If there are two founders, this would be about $240K investment at the valuation of $500K (2.5M * 20%). That means the founders should get 48% in vested shares in the company. Instead they get all their share as unvested shares and have to work for the next 4 years in the company to earn them. Considering the remaining sacrifice they have to make, it is totally fair for them to receive 60% instead of 48%.",1323887702

Add a JS class to your HTML attribute\nFirstly, as soon as jQuery has loaded you use it to add a JS class to your HTML tag.<p>1\n$('HTML').addClass('JS');\nBecause that only happens when javascript is enabled, you can use it to add CSS styles which only work if the user has JavaScript switched on, like this<p>1\n/* In your css */\n2\n.JS #myDiv{display:none;}\nSo, what this means is that we can hide content when JavaScript is switched on and then use jQuery to show it when necessary (e.g. by collapsing some panels and expanding them when the user clicks on them), while those with JavaScript off (and search engine spiders) see all of the content, as its not hidden. Ill be using this one a lot in the future.<p><a href=""http://www.learningjquery.com/2008/10/1-way-to-avoid-the-flash-of-unstyled-content"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learningjquery.com/2008/10/1-way-to-avoid-the-fla...</a>",1323886542

However, funding the implementation of better PHP runtime implementation may be the most fiscally conservative decision left available to them.",1323886534

Dunning-Kruger[0] is real, and your post doesn't demonstrate the self-awareness the best developers seem to possess.<p>Your writing is sprinkled with emoticons and rife with reduplicated punctuation, both of which (especially the exclamation points) are common signs of immaturity.  Reading this diatribe--and assuming your 50 emails were written similarly--I am forced to accept one of two conclusions: either you're not aware that your writing is unprofessional, or you're aware that it's unprofessional and unconcerned.  Either option does not reflect well on you.  To put it bluntly, if I received an email from you in this style, I would archive it without response, assuming it was from someone who lacked the requisite introspective capability I expect from the people I want to work with.<p>I found it particularly telling that you claim that all five of your phone screens went ""very well"" but marveled that only three companies tried to set up an onsite interview with you.  Unless both the two companies that stopped at the phone screen simultaneously filled the position immediately after your phone screen, you really need to recognize that at least those two phone screens did not go well.  I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.

Take preservatives: on the one hand keeping food fresh prevents various ills, but on the other hand continually ingesting chemical preservatives can cause disease itself such as cancer. The pushback against vaccines is kind of a manifestation of this... or perhaps the <i>perception</i> of risk as I think the science doesn't bear out the fears in this particular case. But in general, the idea that technology is always better seems to be increasingly challenged; often with a legitimate scientific basis.",1323885742

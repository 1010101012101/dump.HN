It doesn't run on Vista/Linux/Mac, but it does run on XP. So I will never upgrade until we upgrade Solidworks versions (unlikely), or Microsoft or the vendor fixes compatibility issues (unlikely). If you want to talk about day to day use, Windows is far inferior.",1224554366

Giving someone the position just because they're famous for inventing a piece of technology is a terrible idea. Schneier would be a much better pick for NCSC because not only is his expertise in security, but he is really good at selling his ideas and motivating average users to get behind best practices. Beckstrom on the other hand is highly intelligent, competent, and intellectually curious, but he isn't really a security expert. He would however be an excellent candidate for national CTO.",1224553380

As a fulltime programmer and xp and vista user - I never felt the need to use macs but for their unix base and cool design. Considered buying one recently but settled for a vista pc with much better configuration at half the price. It has been running great for me with not a single issue in past 6 months. For any need of unix system, I run ubuntu or freebsd vmware appliances on my vista.<p>If apple cannot convince a frugal programmer like me who would love to own a mac - I do not know how even these ads can help them much in the general pc market. I think they will remain limited only to folks who really appreciate their commitment to design and would pay so much extra just for that.",1224552794

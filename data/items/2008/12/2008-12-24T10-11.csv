But when you really think about it, the intent of the two systems are pretty similar:  a mortgage is backed by a physical asset (a home) that is <i>usually</i> worth about as much as the debt that finances it (if not more), and can be liquidated to guarantee the debt if the borrower defaults.  Stock investors have no equivalent physical assets to back their trades, and banks have established the margin-call system to compensate.",1230115893

The post gives the impression you want to be seen as a damaged butterfly. I know someone very like you. He has the same hyper-sensitivities, trolling, avoidance of drugs, obsessive writing and hacking. I class both of you as classic INFPs with a strong need for self-expression.<p>My friend made a couple breakthroughs with his life a few years back. He got into drama/acting and films. These things made him far happier and he began to express himself in a more positive manner. Maybe you should try out this area. It is a good way to get some decent friends.",1230114648

408680,comment,408060,408104,0,0,mattobrien,,,"In the long term we are all dead. Or, to quote Keynes again, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. It's not just a question of whether these real assets will rebound in value within the next few months/years - it's also a matter of how much margin the HMC might need to put up for realized losses. Deleveraging forces you to sell at firesale prices into illiquid markets.<p>The Wall Street firms that bailed out LTCM in 1998 actually made a profit off of LTCM's assets within the next 1-2 years, once the markets returned to rationality. Unfortunately for them, LTCM didn't have the capital to weather that storm. Depending on what else HMC holds, they too might be forced to liquidate what seem like economically sound positions at a loss.",1230113849

408676,comment,394609,408129,0,0,jbjohns,,,"What is the ;-) for?  You think you've found one?  If so, you would do better not to judge people for whom the sum of your knowledge is: ""they don't completely agree with me"". ;-)<p>The last project I did at my last job I did several hours overtime every day until the projects completion.  Not because I was asked, or because I felt it was expected.  I did it because I was 40% into a refactoring that I didn't want to back out of.  I could have, as my manager suggested, gone back to the main branch and added the new business feature requests and avoided the overtime, but the maintainability of the code means something to me.  How ""beautiful"" it is, if you will.  It didn't bother me to invest the extra time because I knew the several-months-long refactoring that was desperately needed (6+ year old code base that had changed hands 8 or so times) could happen no other way.<p>I think you over-simplify and focus in the wrong area.  In any thing people set out to do, the best ones truly love what they're doing.  Micheal Jordon didn't wake up every morning saying ""Oh, god, do I <i>have</i> to play basketball today?"".  This is also why many fighters retire so many times.  They just can't stay away.  The thing to look for in other programmers isn't ""oh, look! He only worked 7 hours today, he's a free-loader!"".  What happens when you ask them about programming projects they do outside of work?  Does the thought create an instant grimace on their face?  It will for most, but not the best ones.<p>Personally, I'd rather have one guy who works 4 hours a day that's passionate about programming then 2 of your non-loafers.  They tend to cause me the most work in the end. ;-)",1230113487

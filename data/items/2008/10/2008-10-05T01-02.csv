323777,comment,323616,323772,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"This is interesting. From life experience (over-educated liberal parents, 4 years in Cambridge, MA, 1 year in Berkeley), the ""left-wing"" is as class oriented as the neo-cons (that is, if you can define ""class"" via degrees granted). I've been on the hook to marry someone with at <i>least</i> a master's degree since I turned 25.",1223171782
323775,comment,323566,323769,0,0,wheels,,,"I too kept a membership as long as was a student.  The fact that the ACM sent dozens of spam messages after I was no longer a student and didn't want to pay the $200 fee also burned me on them.<p>I'd still pay $50 a year.  I'd even pay $20 a month for the months where I'm doing research intensive stuff.  I'd pay $2 for a paper probably.  But given the fact that I can find nearly every paper that I need elsewhere it's often hard to justify $200 a year for an organization that I'm not terribly fond of.<p>Other major annoyance -- even if you get a paper <i>accepted</i> at an ACM conference, you have to pay the several hundred dollar registration fees.<p>I think if there were an alternative organization with backing from a handful of notable computer scientists, that made membership more ubiquitous, built a community around computing research and streamlined things like the peer review process, it could be pretty powerful.",1223171496
323774,comment,323616,323651,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I'm actually another example of an immigrant founding a tech company (though I've moved and traveled so much I have a hard time thinking of myself as an immigrant as opposed to a ""world citizen""). I'm an immigrant to Canada, and eventually (and temporarily) an immigrant to the US. My non-immigrant partners decided to push me out and have since demonstrated their complete lack of creativity and drive. Though they're great at manipulation.",1223171419

323772,comment,323616,323616,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"""There is also another factor at work. A trend is underway in America for marriage to be increasingly “assortative.” That means children of well-educated parents tend to marry one another and the children of less educated parents tend to marry one another. This was less the case a few generations ago. For example, sociologists Christine Schwartz of the University of Wisconsin and Robert Mare of UCLA found that beginning in the early 1970s there was a striking “decline in the odds that those with very low levels of education marry up.""<p>I'd be curious to see if someone has connected this to the rise of the Neo-cons. They're all about classism.",1223171113

323769,comment,323566,323743,0,0,silencio,,,"I can see where you are coming from..but between my ACM and IEEE CS <i>student</i> memberships costing only like $50/year combined (give or take a few for the variety of add-ons) and giving me access to MSDNAA (lots and lots of MS software my school doesn't even come close to providing), Safari Books Online, Books24x7 and other resources, I can still see a reason why I still pay for both.<p>The original writer does have a point about what's showing up in publications like CACM, but there are alternatives for publication (i.e. arXiv) and an organization would have to provide more than just that to be a significant alternative to either one.",1223170802

323764,comment,323653,323731,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I definitely enjoyed the books. The thing about ""quack"" is that that often means ""not of the world"" - his genius is only apparent to the people not practicing the same craft at first, and it's only much much later, that the people who practice the same discipline realize his genius. Because they're caught up in the current fads, getting and spending, commerce, etc. Gaudi was considered a weirdo during his lifetime.<p>I'm not an architect either.",1223169360

I can't imagine my life without Google anymore.<p>Don't you remember the days without Google?

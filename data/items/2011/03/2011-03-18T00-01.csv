But a gizmo which pulls electrical or magnetic energy from the sun or surrounding space by some heretofore unimplemented and unaccepted method is not as much of a pipe dream.

He's a talented businessman who has done a lot of things really well, but I haven't seen him do anything I couldn't have done in his position.

Most likely they'll push for you to be hosted on z10 (mainframe) architectures and DB2. They can run it across a multi-site SYSPLEX in multiple tightly controlled data centers. They've got a handful of customers who have been continuously up since at least the late 1980s in a config like this.<p>This topic came up at OpsU in SF a couple weeks ago. I think the consensus from all was that looking for ""five-9s"" is a very bad proxy for asking the question, ""What is the cost-benefit of downtime mitigation strategies?"" I've worked on systems that required (either because of regulation or health and safety) appreciably 100% uptime. The cost for near-perfect uptime almost never balances against the cost of downtime including lost revenue, lost customer confidence and the like.<p>Now, one of those applications did happen to be a telecom application (a switch), and there was, before deregulation, a universally accepted requirement that billing records must  continuously capture 99.999% of the time.

They reality is the opposite, they withered away while news media grew fat and lazy. It's easier to concentrate on reprints of family circle, regurgitated wire reports, opinion pieces, and facile human interest stories than it is to do the hard gum-shoe work of real reporting.<p>The internet has pulled the rug out from under newspapers by taking away the value of all that fluff, because broadcasting is now effectively free and ubiquitous. That means that the only substantive value newspapers have anymore (outside of tradition, which will only maintain for so long) is in their original reporting and the quality of their opinion. Even in the off chance that there are news institutions with substantial value in these areas it's unlikely that the public is willing to pay enough for that to also support paying money for editing wire reports and redistributing beetle bailey. But newspapers are generally fundamentally incapable of redefining themselves as anything other than the bloated institutions they've been, they would rather go down with ""dignity"" than to change who they are.<p>Why do I care? Because I care about the news and I hate to see it continue to be dragged down by these failing corporate behemoths.<p>I think the future of journalism is, as I said, in much leaner institutions who put the focus on the subject and the quality of reporting first, are not burdened by the bloat of outmoded institutional conceptions of what being a ""newspaper"" means, and who have financial incentives which align with the incentives to produce better reporting.",1300408356

Searching and your getHeavyRotation are examples of ""GET the collection resource, but filter the resources to include in the list"". For this I use the path to identify the collection and query parameters to specify the filtering.<p>Query parameters are appropriate here because they're not being used to specify which collection resource to retrieve. They're being used to alter the representation of the collection. This is just like using start and count query parameters to allow paging through a large collection.<p>For your search, you would use a single query parameter, and for getHeavyRotation you would use one parameter for each field you can filter on. They'd be optional of course, and if none are specified you get the whole collection.<p>Regarding deleting songs ""safely"", I'm not sure what you mean but I'm guessing you want some confirmation or recovery. I assume each song has a playlist attribute; instead of allowing a DELETE method on the song I would have a trashbin playlist, and allow the song resource to be updated with the playlist attribute changed to the trashbin uri. That allows the songs to be recovered if they are moved by mistake. To really clear it out, you could allow DELETE on /{trashbin uri}/{song id}.

2338778,comment,2338121,2338712,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I initially thought you were just splitting hairs, but seeing as you've used this argument somewhere else in this thread I think this might be a genuine thought you have so I will take the time to explain why home-screen web apps are absolutely nothing like other native apps on the system, and actually essentially the same as loading a web page in MobileSafari. So for starters, let us observe that there are three instances where JS can run on iOS that we care about:<p>1. MobileSafari, from a web page loaded from a URL.<p>2. Home-Screen Web Apps, web pages loaded from a URL that the user then 'saves to the homes screen' which are loaded in some mysterious, but APPLE WRITTEN, ""wrapper"" process X.<p>3. UIWebViews within native apps that you buy on the App Store.<p>Now, my position is that (1) and (2) are for all intents and purposes the same, and (3) is possibly different. So, the whole argument about turning it off for UIWebView is that the interaction between native code and Nitro might offer an additional vector of security concern. Well, in both (1) and (2), there is <i>no user native code</i>. It literally just either downloads the JS off the web, or reloads it straight from the web. All the native code is written PURELY by Apple. So in a world where the only user modifiable code comes from the web, then clearly this is the same as where we started with MobileSafari. The additional thing to realize, is that unlike native apps (3), home-screen web apps (2) are NOT code signed, just like web pages (1). So that also nullifies the argument that allowing Nitro on home-screen web apps would go against Apple's code signing policies.<p>Hopefully that explains my thinking a little bit clearer.<p>Once again, I am very willing to believe that they had a deadline to meet, and turning it on for home-screen web apps got punted. That makes <i>perfect</i> sense. The security argument however falls flat on its face.",1300407835

2338757,comment,2334939,2336018,0,0,swift,,,"In both OOP and FP, to know what a function (or a method) does, you need (at a minimum) to check its type signature. There are _many_ OOP languages which do not use explicit type signatures, and many FP languages which do; it seems to me that you have confused the OOP vs. FP issue with the issue of explicit vs. implicit typing, or perhaps with static typing vs. dynamic typing. There are languages available to suit pretty much every combination of those properties, so you can easily avoid whatever you don't like.<p>Further, when you check a type signature, what you read is much more valuable in a pure FP context than in a typical OO context, because OO languages generally (1) allow and encourage the use of state, and (2) do not distinguish in the type system between functions/methods that use state and those that don't. The type signature of a pure function strongly constrains what that function can actually do - so much so that it's possible, and effective, to look up the function you need just by specifying the type that you expect it to have. In a typical OO language, the type signature indicates much less about a method's behavior, because its inputs include not only the parameters you provide, but also the entire ""world"" at the time it is invoked; similarly, its outputs include the entire ""world"" in addition to its return value. As an example, a pure function that takes no parameters can only be a constant, but an impure method that takes no parameters could play a song on the speakers, display a window on the screen, or launch a missile.<p>FP and OOP certainly have both strengths and weaknesses. I suspect one reason that OOP catches so much flak around here is that people are more familiar with it, and the flaws in tools you're familiar with are easier to see. Unfortunately, when you're not familiar with a tool, it can also be easy to see flaws - flaws that aren't really flaws at all, but simply aspects of the tool you don't yet understand. The result of this, I think, is that one should ignore criticisms of OOP from people who aren't deeply familiar with it, and similar for shallow criticisms of FP. Unfortunately, there are a lot of both on Hacker News.",1300407279

In order for all of the existing mechanisms for managing things that look like apps to work in reasonably logical ways (launching the app, switching between apps, resource managing the app while it is in the background, isolating faults from the app, etc.), home screen web applications are each represented by Web.app.<p>On a similar note, in order for similarly interesting behaviors to work with iAd (home button acting as ""close"", address space isolation to keep your process from messing with the ad, etc.), there is an application that backs them called WebSheet.app that also causes these to be in separate processes.<p>Of course, this means that there is no real good reason why Apple has disabled Nitro for full-screen web applications (that I at least yet understand), and so I'd expect that this was frankly just a silly oversight (and I may know more about what reasoning went into this when I get around to pulling apart how Apple grants MobileSafari this privilege).",1300407119

2338738,comment,2338121,2338406,0,0,Someone,,,"The new vector is that, in Safari's case, Apple audited the code that calls the JIT.<p>If UIWebView could JIT, somebody would write an app that dumps the JITs code (I assume that ARM does not have the ability to mark pages as 'executable, but not readable') and run it on a development system. From there, (s)he would figure out what the JIT does to make data executable. That knowledge could be used in an app that can execute code that Apple hasn't seen.<p>Of course, that app would need to pass the app store approval process to be useful, but that should not be hard.<p>A way around this is to move the JIT to the kernel or to a different process. I would guess that that would hinder performance so much that, in typical usage, JIT-ting becomes too expensive to speed up things. Alternatively, Apple could not have spent the time to do so (yet).",1300406974

2338724,comment,2338121,2338662,0,0,tolmasky,,,"For starters, my argument is only about MobileSafari (MS) and home-screen web apps.<p>If you read my other posts I think you'll see I have no issue with the idea that there may be a security issue with JIT. That is fine and acceptable.<p>What I have an issue with is the idea that MobileSafari is somehow the safest place to put it. If there is a security issue, then MobileSafari is clearly the absolute least safe place to put it (vs homescreen web apps), since any malicious web page has access to it. That includes random ads loaded on otherwise safe web pages. The user is not prompted when entering a web page if they want to use Nitro or not, so basically anything goes on the open web. If a security flaw is discovered in Nitro, I have only to place it on an ad that gets deployed to popular sites to take advantage of it. And Apple's only recourse is to issue an entire <i>system upgrade</i> and hope people update.<p>Home-screen web apps are thus at least as safe as MobileSafari, since they are literally just bookmarks that load web pages (in a different process and without chrome, but fundamentally the same, no access to any other native code or anything). They are in fact arguably more safe, because the user has to <i>first</i> grant it ""home-screen"" status. This is a sensible time to ask the user if this ONE app should deserve more privileges than the rest of the wild-west web. In other words, had apple done the opposite, ONLY allowing home-screen web apps access to Nitro, it would make <i>a lot</i> of security sense, especially because Apple could warn the user before they download the app saying ""downloading this app gives it access to the special Nitro engine, which may be less secure..."".",1300406776

Don't worry about making something to get a lot of money/girls/ice cream (I know, that was first on your list of desires wasn't it...). If you have several ideas and they all excite you... Before I finish let me emphasize this point -- they all excite you. You are a lot less likely to finish or even make significant head way if you don't care about the idea. Now back to your regularly scheduled post. ... talk to your friends, see which one they get excited about.<p>Not always, but typically if you have a good idea, it should only take a few sentences (at most a paragraph) to get others excited about the idea. This isn't 100% perfect, but it is a nice rule of thumb.<p>If all else fails, just pick one. One thing all good programmers, from the Knuths to the Zawinskis of the world, have in common is they all program/read code constantly.<p>Last but not least, good luck.

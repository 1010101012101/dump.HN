When he gave this ruling, he never thought his Court was a threat to the democracy or he grossly misinterpreted constitution or completely disregarded founders original intent or violated deeply held belief of most Americans. But apparently gay marriage does all of that for him. His other dissents includes things ranging from teaching creationism in schools (yes, he supported that) to environmental law cases. In all of those dissents he openly accused his colleges for relying on their &quot;private&quot; opinion instead of actually adhering to their job of interpreting constitution. If you look at how he himself did his job so well to interpret constitution so that corporations have same rights as people even years before gay people can dream of, you see how his twisted view of the world is.<p>Overall, I would expect justices in supreme court have display some level of courtesy, dignity and respect to their own colleges on the same bench. Accusing them as being unprofessional, incompetent and even intentionally so malign to declare them threat to nation every time they disagree with him - all these is clear indicator that Scalia is not fit for the bench.

The lack of tools like java findbugs had been annoying me.<p>Luckily the server side &#x27;workflow&#x27; language, and the client side templates are all written in xml, so its trivial to parse.<p>The first version was painfully slow. The second version tracked the range of possible states as it did a depth first search of the AST, and then stored the requirements of each node of the tree before it moved on to the nodes next sibling or parent.
That way if another part of the software later called into an equivalent subtree, I could compare the current range of possible states to the requirements of the first node in the subtree and record any mismatches, then move on.
It went from taking over a minute to evaluate a fairly trivial app, to parsing the biggest apps my company has ever shipped in 1-2 seconds.<p>I&#x27;m sure the technique is quite common.

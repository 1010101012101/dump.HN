8349042,comment,8348473,8348995,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> I know it&#x27;s popular to imagine a society where people stopped owning cars, where cars are always right-sized for the situation, where cars show up on demand and parking lots made obsolete, etc etc, but that&#x27;s a 1950s Popular Mechanics style of sci-fi pipe dream.<p>It does seem kind of plausible. Right now you need a car for everything. To get to work, to buy groceries or anything else from a store, to get to any kind of recreation, etc.<p>Now suppose there exists an autonomous electric taxi that you can hail from your phone and use to get from one end of the city to another for around $1. You no longer need a car for anything but getting to work. Rush hour is the peak demand so the price of a ride during rush hour would be prohibitive for commuting.<p>But the same reason the car operators can&#x27;t justify buying more cars just for rush hour is the same reason commuters won&#x27;t want to do it. Once commuting is the only reason you own a car you start looking for housing and employment near functioning mass transit. Which is going to bring people back into the cities. And once you do that and people give up owning a car the rest of it follows.",1411354581

FAIL!!!\n2) the &#x27;result&#x27; parameter unnecessarily pollutes the interface. reduce can be reduced to foreach (doseq) with state and be implemented like other tranducers that require state.<p>Correcting for these two errors:\na) the 0-arity init function is removed\nb) the 1-arity completed function becomes 0-arity\nc) the 2-arity reducing function becomes 1-arity\nd) a 1-arity error function is added.\nSince these functions cannot be distinguished by arity alone, we give them names: call the reducing function &#x27;onNext&#x27;, the error function &#x27;onError&#x27;, and the completed function &#x27;onCompleted&#x27;, and optionally, group the three functions into an object and voila, we have Rx Observers.<p>Hickey&#x27;s twist here is composing Observers instead of Observables. Whether this buys you anything worthwhile is debatable.<p>Two derivations of Rx often accompany it&#x27;s introduction:\n1) Observable being the dual of Iterable\n2) Observables being Promises with multiple return values.\nThanks to Hickey, we can add Observers being an abstraction from reduce/fold (along with it&#x27;s many other names).",1411354155

In practice, this is bare bones, but strictly that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s required.<p>A process manager then usually provides an abstraction around processes (usually PIDs) called a &quot;service&quot;, implementing a minimum of start/stop/restart/status. Status is most primitively done using a PID file. Other extensions like conditional restart can be added.<p>A process supervisor then ensures that processes are automatically restarted, that inotify(7) triggers are added, that system load is monitored, applying resource limits, emailing an admin upon state change, etc.<p>Such a trichotomy is rarely expressed, but a hypothetical example that would likely work would be sinit + svc + perp.<p>Autorestart should be expressly enabled by the sysadmin&#x27;s choice and disabled by default, due to the possibility of buggy daemons improperly backing up their state, as well as edge cases that may be present in the admin&#x27;s particular environment.",1411354153

I am young myself, and (if I didn&#x27;t know how to program) I&#x27;d probably end up hiring someone at the low-cost end of the spectrum, because $100/hour for good people is... wowzers.<p>But that premium typically buys you more than just people who discuss things more professionally. Paying professional wages gets you people who, when they notice there might be a conflict between what you describe and what&#x27;s possible, propose the best solutions, instead of just sassing you. Sounds weird, but that really is one of the most valuable skills freelance engineers can develop. And the more abstract you can get with your solutions, the better -- if you pitch the idealistically abstract &quot;you will have more money&quot;, your life gets very easy.

Change that and every design parameter changes.&quot;</i><p>I doubt this. The American car (distinct from cars in general) is not only a utilitarian tool but a cultural artifact. For huge portions of the country it is the manifestation of freedom - especially now that we&#x27;ve demolished all of our urban areas in favor of freeways and strip malls. Look at American culture and you&#x27;ll see that personal car ownership is intrinsically associated with freedom, coming-of-age, and a huge host of cultural values that Americans take very seriously.<p>If you think making driverless cars is going to suddenly tilt us away from single-occupant SUVs and into little self-driving pods (Minority Report style), IMO you&#x27;re sorely mistaken. At best we&#x27;re going to get SUVs without a steering wheel. Cars will not get substantially smaller without regulatory intervention, people will continue to own personal automobiles, and they will still have more seats than are needed 99% of the time.<p>Driverless cars will be great, but I think you&#x27;re severely overestimating their impact on car design/ownership/usage patterns.

8348970,comment,8348689,8348826,22,0,bodyfour,,,"The first UNIX machine that I used was a 286.  There were several companies that offered UNIX or UNIX-like environments on AT hardware.  In my case I began with Microport UNIX, but I did get my share of Xenix later on.<p>In our case we had several rs232-connected terminals we used to do development on.  By today&#x27;s standards it was primitive, but the tools weren&#x27;t really that different : we had vi, make, a C compiler, etc.  We also used troff for typesetting documentation.  Primarily we were developing bespoke curses-based apps for various companies.<p>In addition to the serial terminals, the console supported virtual terminals.  You could switch between four of them with Alt+F1/F2/F3/F4 just like a modern linux machine in text mode.  This made the console a coveted spot for doing programming.<p>We certainly weren&#x27;t running X11.  For one thing, it would have taken too many resources.  X11 was barely usable with 4MB of RAM (I think we started with 2.5MB but we did upgrade that a bit eventually) but at that point you wouldn&#x27;t want to run a compile job too.  With 8MB it was actually usable enough to run some xterms.<p>However, even if that machine had the RAM the SVR2-based OS wouldn&#x27;t have been modern enough to run X.  You didn&#x27;t have sockets, the select() system call, gettimeofday() (only second-granularity timekeeping was available from the kernel), etc.<p>You didn&#x27;t have networking of course, other than uucp.  With uucp you could at least hookup with the internet for email and usenet although we never did that.  We did have local email though.  (Only the mailx CLI though; nothing as fancy as Elm or PINE)<p>I remember processes could only use up to 20 file descriptors.  Of course, without sockets there wasn&#x27;t much to spend them on.<p>There was no multithreading, although SYSV shared memory was available.  If you really wanted to you could do MT-like programming using explicit shared memory segments, but it usually wasn&#x27;t worth the bother.<p>Everything on the machine was statically-linked.  Shared libraries would have been pretty difficult to implement on the 286 since it didn&#x27;t have real virtual memory: each process&#x27;s memory had to be contiguous in physical RAM.  Of course this meant that there was no mmap() system call.  malloc() was implemented completely on top of sbrk()<p>There wasn&#x27;t any job-control (^Z/fg/bg etc) -- every terminal was running a single process at a time.  Tools like screen were just becoming available but we couldn&#x27;t use it since that OS didn&#x27;t support pty&#x27;s.<p>The shells available weren&#x27;t nearly as fancy as we have today -- no up-arrow to get the previous command, etc.  In fact, when we started we only had /bin/sh: if you made a typo in a command you&#x27;d have to retype the whole thing.  Very soon afterwards we got a copy of csh so we could do editing like &quot;!!&quot;, &quot;^foo^bar&quot;, etc.<p>For scripting we mostly had awk/sed/sh.  This was before perl became popular; obviously before things like python and ruby were on the scene.<p>Oh, and I should also mention: these types of OSes were sold for around $1000 in 1986 dollars.  There were some cheaper options, primarily Coherent&#x27;s unlicensed UNIX clone which started at around $100.  However, the biggest player in the space was SCO and they stayed eye-watering expensive until they got swept away by the tide of Linux and BSDs in the 90s.<p>Anyway, although it was primitive in every way compared a modern Linux or OS/X machine it was certainly a useful environment for its time.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this sort of history, I&#x27;d recommend checking out <a href=""http://www.tuhs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuhs.org/</a>  You can get even earlier PDP-11 versions on UNIX and run them in an editor.  It&#x27;s fascinating to see what parts of changed drastically and what things are exactly the same 35 years later.",1411351534

I ended up needing outpatient treatment almost every day for over a month. Each day was a $25 co-pay. I then moved on to a once a week treatment for close to the next year. I could afford that, many people cannot. I was also lucky to be able to collect my pay while I was getting treated because my employer provided me disability. The cost just skyrocketed beyond belief and while I already maxed out my co-insurance my treatment was billed like an office visit so co-pays are treated differently.",1411351480

8348961,comment,8347636,8348837,1,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"The beauty is there is always plausible deniability. But take diabetes (I&#x27;m speaking type 2 here, to be ckear) as an example: we know there are safe dietary interventions that result in controlled blood sugars and significant reductions in medication use. These diets have study after study showing their safety. Yet, when a person is diagnosed as diabetic, they are told to eat a diet opposite of what the studies show will manage their diabetes, all while being given a prescription to take more meds. Dietitians are openly hostile to a diet that literally saves people&#x27;s limbs.<p>If you look at how the sponsorship model works in these orgs, companies are essentially buying the ability to provide continuing education. And while I don&#x27;t necessarily believe the sponsors are out-right lying, I do think they are presenting a very one-sided view.<p>There is a further problem that we saw as soon as the USDA published its food guide (a document that hasn&#x27;t changed substantially in 30 years): the government now had a baseline of what research should try to prove. If your hypothesis didn&#x27;t follow the orthodoxy, you lose your funding and perhaps your job.<p>Diabetes is a complex illness. We don&#x27;t know the actual cause, and we don&#x27;t know what actually will cure it, but today&#x27;s pharmacological path sells lots of drugs and results in lots of neuropathy, amputations, heart disease and dementia. Hardly what I would call managing. It&#x27;s not a given that a strong focus on diet would change anything, but it might. It&#x27;s worth a try.<p>I fully admit to being biased. It is not only possible, but likely, that I overstated my case on TLAs caring more for themselves. Certainly, tuberculosis organizations did wonderful things. It does make me wonder if we passed a point somewhere where corporate interests in profits at any expense overshadowed the health of people. I don&#x27;t like that hypothesis (I don&#x27;t believe people, in general, are that selfish), so I am actively looking for alternatives. Understanding the cause helps us solve the problem.",1411351306

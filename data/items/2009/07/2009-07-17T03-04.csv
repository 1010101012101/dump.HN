709253,comment,708615,709233,0,0,tc,,,"There is really no need to pick a fight between the Austrians and the Chicago School.  Austrians are sympathetic to the Chicago School, particularly as they have adopted many Austrian insights.  In fact, many of today's Austrians come from a monetarist background (Friedman as a gateway drug?), but later came to see how it is misguided and incongruous to oppose price controls on rent but support them on capital (interest rates).<p>The real conflict today is between free market supporters (Austrians and most monetarists) and the supporters of big government (Keynesians and the mercantilist-style neoclassicals).  Unfortunately the latter have been commanding government policy for some time.",1247802887

It's made me actually check their blog, which I haven't read in awhile otherwise.<p>It's fascinating from the standpoint of ethics and journalism. Internet journalism to boot. It's fascinating from an IP law perspective, something people here tend to deal with a lot. It's fascinating from the computer security/social engineering perspective. And it's just a fascinating look into Twitter's deepest darkest secrets. It's possibly unethical (I don't think so, but that one's above my pay grade) but even if so it's still very interesting.<p>The wall of shame link is just a political rant reducing a complex First Amendment issue to a diatribe. It's mean-spirited (though perhaps warranted, depending on your viewpoint, but that's irrelevant here). It's not more interesting or relevant than if it were asking us to boycott Rush Limbaugh's advertisers. It's unlikely to be fruitful. And it's not in any way relevant to the tech topics usually discussed here.",1247802441

TechCrunch) have a right to print whatever they want, whether by free speech or by free press.<p>Right,  there are narrow restrictions for e.g. libel.  In that example those restrictions apply to congress's ability to regulate libel, and it has been in the past been a constitutional question.<p>How would you hypothesize that Twitter could go after TechCrunch without invoking a law at either the federal or state level?",1247802305

That triggered the 1st Amendment protections. Here, with TechCrunch, neither the Federal Government or any State Government are trying to prevent TC from printing the information. Therefore, the 1st Amendment does not apply.<p>I admit that I have zero knowledge of journalism practices.

709229,comment,709203,709223,0,0,rwolf,,,"I may be wrong, but I believe the page is not suggesting a temporary TechCrunch boycott by advertisers. While I agree that advertisers are not Arrington's boss, they do have more leverage than your average commenter (as the linked page says, ""A note to the people paying Techcrunch's bills can make a big difference. They care what their customers think.""). The attention-grabbing ""wall of shame"" phrasing makes this a little hard to parse.<p>For people upset about the Twitter leak, convincing the advertisers to support their idea doesn't sound crazy.

Also, as some topics go back and forth between [dead], there needs to be some way to discuss borderline cases. On the topic itself is better than followup stories (like this one).",1247800799

Only people who bought tulips lost money.<p>It's also widely thought today that the tulip mania was brought on in part by a parliamentary decree that weakened contractual protections on tulip contracts -- making it easy to speculate on inflated tulip prices without a correspondingly strong fear of loss.<p>There is also a strong case to be made that, similar to the current situation, the tulip mania was prompted or sustained by a sudden increase in the monetary base.

709213,comment,708095,708823,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"<i>Throughout the 1980s, Sierra sold a ton of games with horrible EGA craphics, but which were basically cinematic games with fairly simple decision-tree gameplay.</i><p>This has always struck me as one of the most interesting aspects of computer game history.<p>Back in the old days, adventure games were all about the story and experience, not the gameplay.  This even continued into the 90s in some cases, with games like <i>Planescape Torment</i>, which contained over <i>800,000 words</i> of text, and the ill-fated (but brilliant) <i>Last Express</i>, a game whose graphics was made by rotoscoping tens of thousands of scenes made by professional actors!<p>These games weren't about brilliant game mechanics, in-depth strategy, or competitive experience.  But few deny that they were great games.  Of course, the genre basically died towards the end of the 90s--and many claim that it killed itself ( see <a href=""http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/77.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/77.html</a> ).<p>Interestingly enough though, I've noticed that despite the proliferation of seemingly mindless entertainment these days, there has been somewhat of a revival of the genre of ""games with lots of text"".  The genre of visual novels, once just an offshoot of silly Japanese dating sims, has begun to turn out some seriously impressive material.  The most impressive to date, IMO, has been <i>Umineko no Naku Koro ni</i> (""When the Seagulls Cry""), a murder mystery reminiscent of a cross between <i>The Last Express</i>, <i>The Usual Suspects</i>, and Agatha Christie's <i>And Then There Were None</i>.  Even more unusually, it has no decision tree at all: it is completely linear.  The ""gameplay"" is the author's challenge to the players--to solve his mystery before he reveals the true answer in the final episodes of the game.<p>In a sense, we've come full circle: we began with simple mostly-linear adventure games, gone to complex, branching plots, and now we're back to simple, mostly-linear adventure games.",1247800250

LLVM also historically has focused on ""normal"" (i.e. AOT) compilation so is more concerned about generating good code even if it takes a while (which isn't the main focus for MS CLR, or Mono's JIT). LLVM have improved their x86 -O0 perf, but it's still not as fast as the fast path on JIT-focused backends.<p>So, yeah, there's a cost.

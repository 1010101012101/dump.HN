8046988,comment,8046461,8046461,2,0,goldenkey,,,"Overworking oneself is foolish. Great labor is made with precise work in clear thought, under a nourished and well-recovered body. Strokes of genius on the other hand, can be better aptly recognized for their origin of the mad spurious scientist. Software development usually does not involve too many strokes of genius. The hardest part is being precise, and being comprehensive. Do not take stimulants, code like a maniac, and kill yourself to build something. Build it calmly and collectively. This will reduce regret, and ensure that you do not sacrifice your health for a lucky strike.",1405598355
8046986,comment,8046568,8046568,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"A phrase you sometimes hear, especially in the context of the 1950s and &#x27;60s, is &quot;Every generation thinks it invented sex.&quot;<p>Over-literate high-tech corollary: &quot;Every generation thinks it will destroy sex.&quot;<p>That said, there is legitimate bad news. I don&#x27;t doubt the numbers ascribed to Japan (25% of men and 45% of women having no interest in sex). In the U.S., among people over 25, you&#x27;d probably see similar numbers. And this is in spite of (or because of?) an over-the-top sexualized pop culture that is obsessed with adolescence.<p>In fact, extended adolescence is the problem. Humans have two sex drives. One is r-selective and peaks around 17. The other is K-selective and peaks around 35. Stereotypically, men have a stronger r-drive than women and women have a stronger K-drive. In practice, probably almost all humans have both, and age/gender differentiations are properties of the aggregate. (Differences within groups are greater than those between groups. There are K-heavy young men and r-heavy older women.) The r-selective drive wants variety, escape, and often not a small measure of depravity. It&#x27;s socially unacceptable and people don&#x27;t really admit to it, and most would rather ignore it. The K-drive is the wholesome one tied to long-lasting emotional bonds and that built civilization.<p>Negative stresses provoke the r-drive and squash the K-drive. This makes evolutionary sense, because the r-drive&#x27;s purpose is to repopulate after a catastrophe, and the K-drive (quality over quantity) flourishes in stability. That&#x27;s why extreme income inequality is actually <i>dysgenic</i>, despite the love for it by &quot;Social Darwinists&quot;. It encourages reckless, r-driven sexuality in rich (to assert power) and poor (to escape). It diminishes the K-drive because people look to the future and don&#x27;t really want to bring children into it. The result is that you have more people born of r-driven couplings than K-driven, and the r-drive doesn&#x27;t much care if the other person&#x27;s intelligent... The good news (and if you don&#x27;t think this is good news, you&#x27;re not literate) is that, thanks to birth control, the r-driven couplings rarely produce new people. No one likes when girls go for bad boys (or when men go for useless ditzes) but <i>thank fucking Xenu</i> that those couplings aren&#x27;t producing new people at anywhere near the historical rate.<p>Japan actually has a low level of income inequality, compared to the U.S., but it has a hierarchical work culture. Being someone&#x27;s subordinate for 8-12 hours per day just murders the K-drive. The stress of subordination stokes the r-drive which would, in 700 AD, be inclined to rape and pillage, and with probably less of the pillaging. However, modern society gives a plethora of healthier, legal and less dangerous outlets for that r-drive: pornography, video games, Internet trolling, prostitution, bizarre and often violent cartoon media, or a casual-sex &quot;pickup artist&quot; &quot;Game&quot; that, while still unhealthy and disturbing, is far better than the pre-modern practice of starting a war as an excuse for society to (a) kill off some surplus, low-status men, (b) acquire resources for the low-status men who survive, and (c) give those angry, low-status, otherwise sexless men a chance to rape people. These surrogate activities are much better than their ancient, barbaric predecessors.<p>In broad strokes, the picture we see is that the pervasive subordination (involuntary extended adolescence) inflicted by corporate dominion squashes the healthy, K-selective, sex drive and that, while it encourages the r-drive, that&#x27;s one that is best met through means other than sex.<p>Is this going to kill sex? Nah. Society is sick, and the supposed &quot;sexlessness&quot; trend is one of the ways people are dealing with it. Technology is providing healthy replacements (and sublimations, like video games) for the r-driven sexuality that wasn&#x27;t much good for human civilization in the first place. K-driven sexuality has been reduced (temporarily) by society&#x27;s over-reliance on hierarchical work structures that (a) make the vast majority of people subordinates, (b) resulting in an epidemic of involuntary extended adolescence, and (c) make forward-thinking people disinclined to bring children into a broken, burning world. The picture looks bleak, and society <i>is</i> really sick right now, but is society going to <i>die</i>? I doubt it (unless an environmental catastrophe intervenes). I think the culture is at or near a nadir. It might be worse (perhaps a lot worse, perhaps violently worse) in 5 to 10 years, but in 30 years, human civilization will be better than what it is now. And so is <i>sex</i> going to die out? Not a chance.",1405598299

That would be circular.<p>So when you place a license on your work, you are just granting people these rights which would normally be exclusive to you as the owner, granted to her by copyright.  Again: copyright is not one of these exclusive rights, copyright is property the author owns.  When people receive a copy, <i>they do not receive ownership or copyright</i>.[2]  They receive a physical copy of a work but the &quot;intellectual property&quot; is still held by the author.  At no point was it transferred.  And you cannot on your own claim and transfer the author&#x27;s ownership of the property any more than you can take his home or car or wife.  What you can do (as the license permits) is to practice these rights such as copying, performance, etc. which are normally exclusive to the owner.<p>Re-assigning or transferring copyright (in the sense that you become the owner and can sue the original author as Alupis intended) quite literally means transferring one&#x27;s property to someone else.  If the author of a work transfers his copyright, <i>he no longer owns the work</i>.  It gets a new owner, just like your car would do if you gave it to someone else.  Transfer of copyright is not at all the same as granting other people the same rights you have.  In the US, such exclusive transfer of copyright cannot happen without black-on-white and the signature of the owner:<p>[1]<p><i>Any or all of the copyright owner’s exclusive rights or any subdivision of those rights may be transferred, but the trans\u00ADfer of exclusive rights is not valid unless that transfer is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner’s duly authorized agent.</i><p>[2]<p><i>Mere ownership of a book, manuscript, painting, or any\nother copy or phonorecord does not give the possessor \nthe copyright. The law provides that transfer of ownership \nof any material object that embodies a protected work \ndoes not of itself convey any rights in the copyright.</i><p>[1][2] <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf</a><p>EDIT: Furthermore, under the Berne Convention, original authors have the moral right to be known as the author.  This right is inalienable: you can&#x27;t give it away, and it cannot be taken away; you have that right even after everything else (i.e. the economic rights) is exclusively transferred to someone else.  I think that makes Alupis&#x27; idea of claiming someone&#x27;s code as his own work illegal.<p>So, in short, no, you can&#x27;t re-assign copyright to yourself and then sue the original author for copyright infringement.  No, you cannot claim to be the original author and to own the work.  No, you do not become the owner of the work when you receive a copy along with a license that allows you to further copy, modify, distribute, perform, etc.",1405596834

While it is definitely not a simple organic construct, it does get stimulated significantly all the time. See [1] what happens when you cut out this factors.<p>Regarding artificial systems, I think more data is the only way to reach super-performing classifiers. The data you supply doesn&#x27;t have to be big but at least the data you extract from raw data should be big. For example, a method called Integral Channel Features [2] is designed to act in such a way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_deprivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_deprivation</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/publication/dollarBMVC09ChnFtrs_0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/publication/dollarBMVC09ChnFtrs_0...</a>",1405595836

I know a company of 5-8000 people who&#x27;s firing 9 managers per month [1] so they don&#x27;t fall into the &quot;group layout&quot; category. They have to persuade them with a resignation package. They plan a &quot;plan social&quot; in a few months. Here&#x27;s documentation about it: [3]<p>It&#x27;s a job. See this agency, at random: [2]. My godfather was a HR manager specialized in &quot;plans sociaux&quot; (=closing factories when famous tech brands moved to Asia), and his job was pretty much explaining CEO of other continents that they have to put money on the table to be allowed to dump a whole factory, which they couldn&#x27;t really get, obviously. The mother company has to help refurbish the local economy so workers find new jobs, or hire a job agency to find jobs and prove workers aren&#x27;t just ditched. When the job is done, he writes the last two resignations: his, and the local director. The length of the process is around 2 years for 500 people. Needless to say, mafia jobs are probably safer.<p>[1] See &quot;New procedures for implementing mass lay-offs&quot; in <a href=""http://www.proskauer.com/publications/client-alert/new-labor-and-employment-legislation-in-france/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.proskauer.com/publications/client-alert/new-labor...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.triplet.com/50-10_employment/50-12_laysoff.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.triplet.com/50-10_employment/50-12_laysoff.asp</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://uk.practicallaw.com/0-503-0054#a362756"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.practicallaw.com/0-503-0054#a362756</a>",1405595820

When you exclude the drugged out parents that other posters have mentioned, and focus on the parents in this story who are generally trying to take care of their kids; I expect they are making mostly rational decisions about how they value their time and resources [e.g., it is worth the extra money to save time and go to a grocery store, because they won&#x27;t actually be starving].<p>This goes back to changing the definition of what you&#x27;re trying to fight from &quot;hunger&quot; to &quot;food insecurity&quot;.

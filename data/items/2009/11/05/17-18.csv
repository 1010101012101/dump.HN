924295,comment,923961,924156,0,0,rdrimmie,,,"I'm a moderately regular (though infrequent) stack overflow user, and I think it's great. I am perhaps biased because some of the work I do is supported by affiliate advertising (though at this point not very much!). And our affiliate links aren't munged onto user-contributed content.<p>Anyway, aside from my bias, I think it's great in part because it makes Stack Overflow money and I Think they deserve that, and in part because it has zero impact on the content the user contributed. It was already a link to Amazon. If anyone follows that link, Amazon is likely to profit and the only reason anyone would follow that link is because it's on Stack Overflow.<p>I'm not sure how I feel about users adding their own affiliations, since in that case they might be taking advantage of Stack Overflow's traffic. I'm also not sure how I then feel about Stack Overflow replacing existing affiliate links with their own (and I don't know how they are handling that situation anyway).<p>It definitely seems a grey area, but I think in this particular case SO is not abusing their users.",1257443920

924286,comment,923889,923889,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"The gist of the article (which is the gist of the headline, and the gist of several comments I've read about this on HN) is that Apple doesn't support X and don't whine about it.  If you want OSX buy a mac, if you want open development don't buy an iPhone, if you want X, don't buy a product that's not X.<p>That's true in a tautological way--it's true by definition.  But it's not useful.  I don't want a mac--I want a netbook that runs OS X.  I don't want an iPhone--I want a phone with an iPhone-quality software stack with an open software ecosystem.  These are not mutually exclusive--they're not inconsistent.  There's no inherent property of OSX that excludes netbooks.  There's no inherent property of the iPhone software stack that excludes an open software ecosystem.  These are arbitrary choices by Apple--perhaps good for a lot of people--but not what I want.<p>And so I want these things--netbooks, phones--that don't exist.  Well, fine.  I'll make them.  But then there are people out there who are actively preventing me from making them, and thus having the things I want.  Not only is Apple saying ""We don't care about X"" but they're saying ""we hate X and will prevent it from coming into being.""  It's being needlessly antagonistic.<p>That's where the whining comes from.  People want things that don't exist, they try to make them, and something actively prevents it.<p>Now you could theoretically go the other way--we have an open software ecosystem and let's construct a great software stack--we have netbooks and let's construct a great OS.  But this must be harder to do, because (as an experimental fact) it happens much less often.",1257443726

Are the hiring companies vetted in any way?<p>There has to be more balance in the model.  Employers can look at you and see how your peers (or actually, anyone with an account) rate you.  Hiring companies should be similarly exposed.<p>As I understood it, we provide the content, we pay for the service, maybe we get job offers from companies that don't suck. Who's getting the most value from this arrangement.<p>(let me state for the record that I really, really like SO. I'm just iffy about this careers business model)<p>It would be good to offer the service free to the unemployed (if that could even be verified).  It's terrible practice to charge people for access to a job if they need the money for food.<p>Maybe a more fair arrangement would be to offer the service free after X number of comments or questions contributed.

I'm not afraid to do that and I don't think other single co-founders should be either.""<p>I think that's the right attitude.  It's like a marriage.  Dual income is a wonderful thing.  Sharing costs, having a permanent partner to plan with, complementary skillsets, etc., etc.  But that doesn't mean you should go grab a mail order bride catalog.<p>There are plenty of successful solo founders out there.  There are also plenty of amputees who overcome that disadvantage and run marathons.  2 good founders are way more than 2 x 1 good founders.  Having a good co-founder almost certainly increases your chance of success and magnitude of it.  It's not just that you have 2x the work output.  You have a duty to someone else all of a sudden-- quitting is less of an option (and quitting ALWAYS kills startups).  You have a second set of brain cells to catch you being stupid-- and you will be stupid about some things.  You have a cheerleader at the low points.  You have someone else keeping their eyes peeled on your market for opportunities that you might miss.  You have a whole new set of connections/relationships to leverage.

To me, it seems like Stack Overflow is taking the affiliate credit for something that a user posts.  I personally don't use Stack Overflow but if I did I would be a little annoyed that they are making money off of the work that I did to find a book for someone.<p>On the other hand, all of the comments I saw on Stack Overflow seemed to indicate that people really liked it [1].<p>1. <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/26964/auto-inserting-stack-overflow-affiliate-into-all-amazon-book-links"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/26964/auto-inserting...</a>",1257440617

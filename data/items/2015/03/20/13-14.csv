JSON has come to be the preferred choice.<p>Which brings me to JSON and complexity: The complexity of retrieving data has been paved over multiple times using libraries.  This has encouraged people to skip XML and go directly to JSON. If retrieval of XML data, or better yet JSON data, were to become simpler, I think more people would structure their webpages to use these types of resources. In the end, it would be a victory for both open Web and open applications.<p>And that brings me to my last point: Dynamic elements. This web ain&#x27;t succeeding without variable based dynamics.

9237716,comment,9232790,9236610,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"I agree that we need to build a mass launcher.  However, I don&#x27;t think we need to build it on the Earth.  I think we need to build it on an airplane.<p>Seriously, the limiting factor in how small you can make an orbital launch packet is atmospheric drag.  The more atmospheric drag, the more mass to surface area ratio you need to reduce the losses to an acceptable level.  The smaller you can make the orbital packet, the smaller you can make the mass launcher.  The smaller the mass launcher, the smaller the capital expense.  A small mass launcher also fits on a smaller airplane.<p>We already have plenty of airplanes capable of flying in the stratosphere which can mount a mass launcher of a few tons weight.  If the goal is getting mass up there, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it is 1000 launches of 1 kg each, or 1 launch of 1000 kg.  But 1000 launches of 1 kg each could be done with much less capital expense.<p>The whole reason we don&#x27;t have a mass launcher is because it is perceived as too expensive.  Sea-level, or even mountain-level mass launchers need to launch large packets by their nature.  But a high-flying airplane could launch many smaller packets with a cost which is actually doable.",1426859844

9237698,comment,9237063,9237459,0,0,jkoudys,,,"XSLT is still good to learn -- I think it&#x27;s conceptually sound, but its implementations are often terrible. I think the big pain points for most people are how finicky XML is in general, but also that any libs you use to generate your XML and translate it require an absurd amount of configuration. Years ago, I saw all the weaknesses in mixed PHP/html for building pages, but all the server-side templating languages looked terrible (still do). I fell in love with the idea that was championed back in the late 90s, where you use your application to build XML, which only describes your data. You&#x27;d then have some XSLT on your web server (or in-browser) that would transform the XML into your document.<p>Nowadays, this isn&#x27;t that different of an approach from using my server-side PHP/python/node/Go to generate JSON, then building my DOM based on client-side templates; since I use ReactJS, my transforms are even still XML. A lot of the best-practices I learned from XSLT transferred over nicely too, e.g. avoiding control logic (<xsl:if>) in favour of <xsl:apply-templates>, since good javascript client-side templates should avoid branching control logic in favour of just Array.prototype.map() wherever you can.<p>I think the real key isn&#x27;t about understanding recursion, though you will gradually gain an appreciation for it, but understanding composition. Templating is too often done in the style common among poor developers, where they think about building a whole &quot;page&quot;, instead of defining the components of that page. XSLT, in theory, would&#x27;ve been great for that, it&#x27;s just a pain in the butt to actually implement.<p>tl;dr if there is a need for this proposal, it would be better met by cleaning out all the cruft from XSLT, and building implementations that don&#x27;t require such arcane syntax nobody can use it.",1426859708

You can set individual icons but you don&#x27;t have icon themes per se, can&#x27;t change the UI theme (and I distinctly remember there was an application that did that very well back on 10.4, and 10.5 broke it along with most other efforts), can&#x27;t change titlebar buttons and so on. E.g. I very much prefer the NeXT arrangement (close button on the right, minimize button on the left), because I <i>really</i> have no use for Maximize on a 27&quot; screen. Good luck with that.<p>To their credit, though, Apple does at least think twice before pushing changes most of the time. Gnome&#x27;s latest effort, with the client-side decorations, is maddening. Now every Gnome application has a thick titlebar that&#x27;s also a toolbar, and every other application doesn&#x27;t. They supposedly did that in order to save screen space - which could have just as well been done by reducing the thickness of that mammoth title bar Adwaita uses - but the effect seems to me to have been exactly opposite. Surely <i>someone</i> must have seen that the result is inconsistent on any system that runs a single application not included with Gnome -- say, for instance, Firefox! Or Chrome! Or Emacs! Or Thunderbird! Whatever.<p>I certainly understand that Gnome developers have a vision for their UI, but the uncommunicative way in which they impose it is pretty unpopular among users (like myself) who moved away from Windows or Mac OS a long, long time ago because they wanted more control over their operating system (well, that and no BSODs, which was a common occurrence at the time when I left Windows behind.

If you keep some and discard others, it is because you already value the ones you keep over the ones you discard.

Rumors are rife, presumably from anonymous peer reviewers, that scientists in China have already used CRISPR on human embryos and have submitted papers on their results. They have apparently not tried to establish any pregnancies, but the rumors alarm researchers who fear that such papers, published before broad discussions of the risks and benefits of genome editing, could trigger a public backlash that would block legitimate uses of the technology.<p>... But scientists don&#x27;t yet understand all the possible side effects of tinkering with germ cells or embryos. Monkeys have been born from CRISPR-edited embryos, but at least half of the 10 pregnancies in the monkey experiments ended in miscarriage. In the monkeys that were born, not all cells carried the desired changes, so attempts to eliminate a disease gene might not work. The editing can also damage off-target sites in the genome.<p>Those uncertainties, together with existing regulations, are sufficient to prevent responsible scientists from attempting any genetically altered babies, says George Church, a molecular geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Although he signed the Science commentary, he says the discussion “strikes me as a bit exaggerated.” He maintains that a de facto moratorium is in place for all technologies until they&#x27;re proven safe. “The challenge is to show that the benefits are greater than the risks.”<p>... Although many European countries ban germline genetic engineering in humans, the United States and China do not have such laws. Research with private funds is subject to little oversight in the United States, although any attempts to establish a pregnancy would need approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In China, any clinical use is prohibited by the Ministry of Health guidelines, but not by law.",1426857861

You can&#x27;t, unless you have super-strong willpower, really engage in any meaningful activity if you spend 8+ hours at work every day and come home tired. So people don&#x27;t.<p>My best friend used to write a lot; she studied journalism and wanted to be a reporter and a writer. After university she got caught in the cycle of shitty jobs. Mind you, she&#x27;s not lazy - she&#x27;s actually the most hard-working and professional person I have ever met in my life. But years of working 8-10 hours a day, six days a week, on bullshit jobs under abusive bosses, made her almost unable to write a single sentence. And constantly asking herself, &quot;will I ever write that book?&quot;.<p>So in TL;DR: no, I don&#x27;t think most people would use universal income to be lazy. They would use it to do meaningful things with their lives. And honestly, if some group of people really decides to spend their lives drinking wine and singing, I say let them. Because if they can and it costs us nothing, why keep everyone enslaved so that some people won&#x27;t get do things we find unworthy?",1426857771

Some of this has resulted in further contract work, some has resulted in contributed fixes or improvements to other libraries.<p>(I&#x27;m now looking to potentially fund a student for some work this coming summer.)<p>Now, I&#x27;m taking a lot of what I&#x27;ve learned from that and starting up a small business (not looking for VC) to produce a new kind of developer tool.

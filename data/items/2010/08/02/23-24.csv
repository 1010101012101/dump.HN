Most mobile sites won't work with it unless Microsoft manages to get IE9 ready for production use with Windows Phone 7. From all the stories I've seen, they seem to think they can restrict users to using IE7 and still have a good mobile experience.

We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job.""</i><p>@volski: <i>""I didn't know Microsoft had a problem, they seem to be doing pretty well. They have some good products.""</i><p>Personally, I use Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Exchange, and I feel they are best in class. For every other product they offer, I feel there are better alternatives.<p>The notion that Microsoft has a problem stems from the fact that most of the new product lines that Microsoft has put to market in the last 10 years, few have been a success. Microsoft's profit comes mostly from licensing and servicing Windows and Office.<p>Meanwhile, in the last 10 years Apple has introduced iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad -- all mega hits. What makes it a sad sight to see is that every time Apple comes up with another iDevice, Microsoft tries to compete, and it simply hasn't worked out for them.

In fact, this should be the norm.  You can't accuse the state of anti-competitive behaviour in this case, because the market you're serving wouldn't even exist if they hadn't created tax filing procedures to begin with.<p>Or, as I like to think of it, governments, by necessity, introduce a certain amount of friction into our lives, and have every right to try and reduce that friction.  If your business is built on reducing that friction, you simply need to ensure that your service stays ahead of the free service, because your profits are not a right.",1280793180

We believe the network at the Pilbara mines to be one of the largest private railways in the world, so although the technology is not new, the scale is.<p>The railway stretches from our Pilbara ports to the mines, which covers roughly 330km. It's a long stretch and train drivers can only physically drive so far before being replaced. We only have a single driver per train, with each train stretching over 2.5km long usually consisting of 230 carriages. We cannot find enough train drivers to maintain our expansion forward and the ones we are hiring are getting older and harder to replace.</i>",1280792796

So at $12.79/month (this is the pricing point I have in mind), the total will be $76.74 per user.  Of course it doesn't make sense for users to pay after their wedding is over.  My plan is to ""freeze"" the account if once user decided to stop paying, however, I'd still let users to login and visit their account page, they just can't make any changes (37Signals actually force you to pay to get back in once you stop the billing, which isn't very nice).  And there will be a 14-day trial (instead of 30 as it said on the site at the moment), but I'll run A/B test on the trial time to see which one is better.  30 days maybe too long and I wouldn't get paid fast enough to survive.<p>But I can totally see that user will want to go with a prepaid package, say 3-month pass at $30 ($8.37 saved) and they don't have to worry about getting charged accidentally after this 3-month period is over.  Or a 6-month package for $50, which is even more savings.<p>I still pretty open about the pricing at the moment, but I know I want to go with a price of $12.79/month (and this number is inline with the response from my survey).  A/B split tests will probably tell me which direction to go in terms of the different pricing packages.<p>TheKnot.com monetize with advertising and affiliation, and in my opinion, despised being a really rich site, their user experience isn't as great.  People who took my survey confirmed this, and a few people replied as ""hated it"" for having too much ads.

They are probably the biggest name in the industry, while Marrily is a one-man product.  Marrily probably won't have that much wedding resources as TheKnot does, but I'll add more and more resources to the site until it truly become a good stop for people to plan their weddings.<p>During the development process, I got an advice from Roy Rodenstein (one of the guys from AngelHackers) to do further market researchs.  This advice was probably one of the best ones that I've got.  I put up a survey (<a href=""http://marrily.com/survey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marrily.com/survey</a>) and ran a couple campaigns on Facebook (total cost: $200).  I got about 20+ responses, and most of them either used or heard of TheKnot.com.  The responses were about 50% hated it, 30% said ""it was decent"", and 20% said ""Loved it"".  I probably need to come back to the survey for more accurate numbers, but basically the survey confirmed my thought that TheKnot is a bit over-crowded, and sold-out.  Marrily is built to be user-centric and keep things as simple as possible.<p>In terms of features, the biggest difference between Marrily and TheKnot is probably the contact/guests management, and the seating arrangement (the rest is probably pretty standard which you can find similar features at a lot of other productivity applications).  Personally I'm truly proud of the Seating Arrangement feature that I built for Marrily.<p>Basically I will respect my users, and I'll do what's best for them, instead of selling out and bombarding them with ads and resources that users won't need.  Users will probably use Marrily as their main planning tool, and TheKnots and other sites to be other sources of inspirations.

1569437,comment,1569172,1569172,0,0,blhack,,,"downvoters: Sorry if this question was offensive; I'm asking about if the ""apple is like a startup"" trend continues into developers being able to choose what kind of tools they want to work with.  My complaining about my MBP isn't meant as a critique of apple, I'm just saying that <i>if it was me</i> I would probably choose a linux machine, not a mac.<p>I apologize for the off-topic question, but is anybody here a coder for apple (or has been in the past?)?<p>Are you allowed to use a non-apple computer if you work at apple?<p>I just got a macbook pro over the weekend (my first mac) and it seems like they've really gone out of their way to make this as difficult as possible to write code on.  No page up/down keys...no dedicated delete key, no home/end keys...it seems like the UI is designed around the mouse.  Alt-Tabbing seems really neutered in comparison to the gnome/kde/windows equivalents...and the solution that is offered is the expose' key (which works, but involves using the mouse).<p>Is there just a steep learning curve?  Don't get me wrong, the machine is very pretty, but it seems like the type of work that geeks do was ignored when they designed this laptop (like having no dedicated right click key?)<p>Obviously they were talking about apple being run like a startup in that the teams are small...one of the things that I see advertised on some job postings for coding jobs is that there is a LOT of flexibility on what your workstation is...is it like this at apple?",1280790231

1569432,comment,1568282,1569167,0,0,Empact,,,"I tend to look at the special interest groups as the problem of distributed costs and concentrated benefits. In the case of the off-shore drilling, the minority has much more to gain individually than the majority has to lose individually, so it's worth the minority's time, money and effort to advocate fiercely, while resisting would expend more effort than the result justifies.<p>So, if we want to dis-empower special interests, we need to empower the general people, specifically by affecting this equation: by decreasing the cost of advocacy, and/or increasing the expected benefit of advocacy.<p>You seem to be attempting to increase the benefits by tying nations to group benefits, and decreasing the cost by redefining advocacy as joining a 'nation.' The challenge here is that for the advocacy to influence the existing system, it needs to result in election results as well, and I don't see that connection quite so clearly.  Could you elaborate?<p>I do think there's something here - with a little help on the advocacy cost/benefit side, voter power could definitely put a damper on special interests in general.   That's the thrust of my own effort in this area, focused on the voter side: <a href=""http://votereports.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://votereports.org/</a><p>P.S.

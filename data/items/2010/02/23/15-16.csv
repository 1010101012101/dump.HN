The mere fact that they are a YC startup, means that they'll get on the front page of Techcrunch, ReadWriteWeb, VentureBeat and dozens of other huge blogs with a ton of PR when they launch. A single post on Techcrunch is worth more link wise, than a million PR1-3 blogs posting about your latest link bait strategy.",1266940762

1145614,comment,1143082,1143312,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"How would he be capable of making that distinction? For us, people who work in the field, it is often simple to say, but would you be qualified to make such judgments on patents about chemistry?<p>Of course, in the perfect world, the patent office would pay enough to employ an expert on everything. But even still, if a world-class researcher on semiconductors, doing experiments nobody in the world has ever done before, walks into the patent office with this piece of germanium that has a few electrodes stuck into it, and explains how introducing voltage between these two modulates the voltage between the these two, would the examiner understand it? Or would he say: ""Oh, this is just the same thing that crystal radios use, on a different material. It's a neat idea, but it's not /that/ revolutionary.""<p>What I am trying to say is that not only would your idea not help, but it could actively hurt, for the same reason giving policemen that are ineffective at catching criminals more power does. If someone is unable to judge on the validity of something, giving him more power to do so can only hurt.<p>Also, from your post one can read that you think the patent office made the 1-click patent as powerful as the patent on transistors. This is just not true -- the patent office does not give strength to patents, the justice system does. Just because you have a patent on the wheel (like a guy in Australia does) doesn't mean you get to charge everyone biking -- for your patent to be used, it must be brought in front of a judge first. There, the patent can be judged much better than it ever could be in a patent office, because it is always adversarial, and the venue is as clean as we can make it.",1266940716

1145609,comment,1145316,1145388,0,0,fexl,,,"Yes, bugs still need to be reported, and not all of them yield to automated tests.  Nevertheless I do concur with the spirit of the article.  I write very demanding test cases, often before anything goes wrong but certainly after it does, even for non-deterministic code (e.g. I'll fork a thousand processes in an automated test and invoke random busy loops here and there to encourage contention.)<p>I don't do a lot of GUI though, other than HTML interfaces, which are fairly amenable to some automated testing.  One time I broke a sign-up form due to a misnamed field, so now I have an automated test for that.<p>For things like ""Capitalization inconsistent in top nav"", that's a prime example of why you still need to keep track of bugs.  Even if you're working alone, just keep a ""TODO"" list.  You can keep the TODOs in a note-taking program such as Tomboy, but better yet, put them right in the code.  Then don't release until ""grep -r TODO"" comes up clean.  (If you want to postpone a TODO change it to LATER.)<p>It might be difficult to create a regression test for that one, and it probably wouldn't be cost effective, but I suppose could have a snippet of code that iterated over the list of navigation items and tested the case.  Again, probably not worth it.  Better just to stomp that TODO and move on.<p>I can't say I have the silver bullet for the examples you list, but the important thing is to keep manufacturing better bullets with higher silver content.  I figure I gotta try at least.",1266940629

IIRC, they were up to their eyeballs in default swaps and CDOs, both of which were beyond toxic at the time.  That 10% payout was going to have to come from <i>somewhere</i>.<p>However, my understanding was that from Berkshire's perspective, it was a straight equity investment for preferred stock.  They didn't really care where the dividend cash came from, so long as they got paid.  So, if it was a derivative play, it was an indirect one.

Roughly what happens is that when an app (actually an Activity.. but we won't get into the difference right now) is no longer visible to the user, the OS automatically saves most of the apps state, and calls the apps onStop method to signal the app to save any app specific state.  If the app <i>is</i> later killed, the next time it's started one of the items passed to the app by the OS is a reference to the previously saved state.<p>The effect for the user is much like you describe it for the iPhone. It's as though your apps never die.  Whenever you restart them, whether it's 5 minutes from now or 5 days, everything is exactly as you last left it.  Except that, unlike on a PC, those ""background apps"" don't take up any resources.

Well, the post is about a company that provides the same service as Backupify but instead steals bank account details.",1266937385

If you are free market, the government can do no good and if you are ""Progressive"" corporations are evil. Munger is mostly above this level of naivete, but not completely. He points out that government spending is too high and that leverage can be too dangerous (i.e. gambling.) However, he seems to be prescriptively mute on the former and favors prohibition on the later.<p>The school of thought to which I am a recent entrant suggests a more uncommonly (expressed) alternative. Keep all the gov debt and spending as low as possible when times are good. Regulate to a minimum. When a crisis occurs, the government should sometimes step in to stabilize a violently turbulent system. (Sounds like Keynes,  no?)<p>However, you don't bailout a company. That ruins the fabric on which capitalism is built. The losers loose their money. An option is a derivative; not all derivatives are options. Bailouts make all derivative speculation, speculation in cheap options. Don't ban derivatives. Ban bailouts.",1266937232

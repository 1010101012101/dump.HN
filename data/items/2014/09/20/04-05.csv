So, these guys won&#x27;t bet their careers on technical material they don&#x27;t understand.  Before 1940, the <i>suits</i> could understand enough about, say, radio and cars.<p>So, do all the pure/applied research you want, those <i>suits</i> won&#x27;t let, or at least won&#x27;t help, the results see the light of day.<p>We did a lot of pure research because (A) that is what the academic world most respects and, thus, for their careers, most researchers wanted to pursue, (B) US research, including workers with pasts in pure research, were a super big help in winning WWII and doing well in the Cold War, (C) the US DoD really liked and respected both pure and applied research, (D) Congress was eager to fund research as part of helping US national security.  Part of the rationale for Congress funding pure research was that (A) the leading researchers told Congress that that was the research to fund and (B) the pure researchers were the profs who trained the <i>worker bees</i> for the more applied research -- so Congress was still happy.<p>What we fund now via NSF and NIH is not too shabby.  If someone actually has some good work background and a really good proposal, then likely they can get funded.<p>But, with some exceptions, take some research results and a proposal for a product to Silicon Valley or the <i>suits</i> in a large company will, get either silence or laughs.  Again, the <i>suits</i> want next to nothing to do with research results.<p>Or, journals will give a serious review of a submitted research paper, but the <i>suits</i> won&#x27;t get past the title page.",1411185981

Alpha particles (helium nuclei) are really big and charged,  so they don&#x27;t travel very far and deposit all their energy near where the decay occurs (as opposed to decay with e.g. neutrinos that essentially never interact and thus deposit no energy). The alpha decay carries a lot of energy so a chunk of Pu238 gets pretty hot.  Couple it with a thermoelectric generator and you have an ideal power source for space applications.<p>Also, alpha particles have almost no penetrative power in human tissue so they&#x27;re harmless as long as the source isn&#x27;t inside of you. Pu238 is almost exclusively an alpha emitter,  so it&#x27;s completely safe to handle for extended periods,  at least radiologically. It puts off a ton of heat and is chemically really toxic though. I&#x27;ve dealt with it in the lab before,  it&#x27;s relatively harmless as far as nuclear sources go. It&#x27;s not suited for weapons either, so it isn&#x27;t directly a proliferation concern, though producing it is because it is related to weapons grade production. You don&#x27;t see it used very often mostly because it can only be made in a specially configured reactor, so it&#x27;s not exactly common.",1411185932

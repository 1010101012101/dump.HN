I mean, without this process the gov wouldn't be able to fund itself other than by taxes.<p>So the federal reserve creates money by loaning at ridiculously low rates (currently it's not a bad idea if there really is a threat of deflation), banks then use that money to fund the government by buying treasuries and in such we just inflate the money supply? So banks are like facilitators for this to happen and get 2% back for it?<p>I dunno, I mean yes they make awe full amounts of money but can you really go about cutting out the middle men completely here?",1255852785

They will pay interest on that borrow, and it can get quite expensive if that stock hard to borrow. They have to return the shares at some point - either when they decide to cover their short, or the lender recalls them.<p>Either way, the lender is still ""betting"" on the price going up, as they will get the shares back at some point in the future.",1255852179

A ""good"" designer may know this and buid a site to cater for these users, but how?

888131,comment,886904,887650,0,0,lispm,,,"I was talking about building them. You switch to coal prices.<p>Mining uranium is cleaner than coal? We had mines here in Germany and they were definitely environmentally very dangerous. Mining in western Europe has mostly stopped, the environmental damages are now transported to other countries. Let's see how the US deals their abandoned Uranium mines. Probably not at all. In Germany we have to deal with former mine. We already have invested almost five billion Euros into controlling the damages.<p>This makes a good read on the work needed to close these mines here in Germany:

The types of coal are different, the mining is different, labor costs are different.<p>The IEEE article is not accurate. The current actions in Germany show the opposite.<p>Reprocessing does not multiply the waste? Wow.<p>Why would you excluded hydro power from renewables. Germany has started to invest in renewables in the last two decades and the trend is clear. The goal is to reach 30% in a few years. That France does not export much  energy from renewable sources is no surprise, they have betted all their money on nuclear power plants.<p>So with the backlog of processing in France, they ship the stuff to Siberia? I wonder if they know what they are doing? Probably not, France just managed to find a bunch of Plutonium in Cadarache. 39 Kilograms of Plutonium dust, instead of the 8 Kilogram the officials knew about.<p>A Blockheizkraftwerk will be run on gas and later on biogas. Sure that solves a lot of problems: it decentralizes energy production, allows easy reuse of heat energy, the energy production can be fine tuned to actual usage, gas is much less environmentally dangerous than nuclear materials or coal, ...
It is estimated 100000 of those will allow us to get rid of two Nuclear Power Plants. 100000 homes with those 'Blockheizkraftwerke' is a moderate goal in a country of 80 million people.<p>Germany already has high energy prices. It is still number one exporter in the world. The German industry is constantly modernizing to lower the demand for energy during production. Countries like China are far behind. It shows in their environment also.<p>The goal for Germany is not to have cheap energy, the goal is to reduce energy consumption, create new technologies and get rid of the old energy wasting industries.<p>That's what the article says, Germany is forward looking and has already started a change that will take many years, with the goal to produce most of the energy in a modern clean fashion and without nuclear power. Some other countries have similar goals. France and the UK don't. Let's see when they wake up.",1255851432

888119,comment,887656,888063,0,0,gchpaco,,,"One of the things that Yossi Kreinin points out over and over again in his FQA is that C++ is full of features that you cannot ignore.  Crockford's <i>Javascript: The Good Parts</i> is made significantly simpler by the fact that Javascript doesn't have the ability to e.g. silently bitslice your objects if you don't write copy constructors at every level, or forcibly pollute your type system with const endlessly, or force you to declare virtual destructors at every level.  It's a much simpler language with numerous weird and positively deranged syntactical and library constructs, but you can ignore syntax pretty easy and ignore the library constructs pretty easy, so you can subset it easily.<p>C++ is much harder to subset, because the various (mis)features lean against each other for support like a tower of cards.  It's not stable, but it's even worse if you leave some of the cards out.  Even compiling C under a C++ compiler lets the nose of the camel in, as it were, due to const correctness.  And (depending on your runtime, but this is required by newer standards) the moment you use new, which you have to use in many ways, you now have a situation where your program can throw an exception.",1255850497

I don't think VW trades in US exchanges and I am not sure whether naked shorts are a factor in Germany. NAked shorting should be differentiated from ordinary legal shorting. Legal shorting is not that problematic because there is a natural limit to it. Theoretically naked shorts can crash any company because they can flood the market with an enormous amount of shares.",1255850129
888115,comment,887656,888063,0,0,jomohke,,,"Such a distinction between good and bad parts is much more difficult to define for C++ than Javascript. Javascript hasn't had the problem of programmers using separate subsets of the language. The bad parts of Javascript are design/implementation mistakes. The bad part of C++ is the overabundance of language features/complexity.<p>However, I think it would be great for someone to design a sensible subset of the language. Provide a lint tool (like Crockford's JSLint) which can enforce the subset. Marketing will be the hard part - a buzzword/name will be extremely useful for branding/word-of-mouth to work.

888114,comment,887656,888007,0,0,kragen,,,"There are other languages you could make it small in, but those languages probably aren't among them.<p>Haskell: Hugs 98 is 723K, but it depends on /usr/lib/hugs, which is 7.3M.  GHC can <i>almost</i> do it; I compiled a ""hello, world"" program with GHC and it ""only"" came out to 366K, which is 84K bigger than μTorrent's reported size.  With UPX, however, it packs to 130k. (ocamlopt's tax is in the same range.) Maybe Haskell would be an option? Or does it bloat up when you include the libraries you'd need for this?<p>Erlang: My Erlang install is 97M. I don't know how much of that is minimally necessary to run things, but /usr/lib/erlang/erts-5.6.3 is 3.6M, 12 times the size of μTorrent. Stand Alone Erlang (<a href=""http://www.sics.se/~joe/sae.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sics.se/~joe/sae.html</a>) is 1.5MB compressed.<p>Common Lisp: All the Common Lisp implementations are pretty big (SBCL, say, is 53M, of which 25M is the image sbcl.core), and they can't produce a standalone executable without including most of the environment. So you're starting at 25M.<p>Java: The JRE on my system is 98 megabytes, so a Java application to run on Win32 will be 98 megabytes plus the application code. Even if you compile your app with GCJ, libgcj is 33 megabytes.<p>Now, you could argue that the size of this stuff isn't relevant because it isn't specific to your hypothetical Common Lisp implementation of BitTorrent, but could also be used by whatever other Common Lisp programs the user has installed. But you would be treating a very-low-probability event as if it were normal.<p>Languages — or rather, language implementations — that <i>could</i> make a 300k runnable BitTorrent client include not just C and C++, but also Forth, assembly, Pascal, Eiffel, and any number of other fatally flawed niche languages that don't require hundreds of kilobytes of libraries just to initialize a process and exit. There are probably also Scheme implementations that would work.<p>Just about anything that has a reasonably small bytecode interpreter and lets you package the rest of your program as bytecode would probably win. x86 code is pretty grossly bloated by comparison to a good compact bytecode. (But compressible. See comment above about UPX.)<p>The only other <i>practical</i> alternative I know of would be Lua, which only costs you about half of your space budget for the interpreter itself. Lua's ""bytecode"" is actually wordcode, but presumably UPX or something similar would squeeze it down to a reasonable size.<p>It's my understanding that μTorrent does not need to ship with any shared libraries to run; the <300k of the executable alone is sufficient. You may think this is unimportant but I think that is an unconcern based in unusual wealth: you probably own your own computer to install software on persistently, probably several of them, you probably have several hundred kilobits per second of bandwidth to download software with, so you probably don't care how long it takes to download something or how much of a 256MB USB pendrive it takes up.<p>It's certainly true that there are any number of languages you could write a BitTorrent client in that would be just as <i>fast</i>.",1255850109

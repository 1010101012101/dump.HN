Most of the Bitcoin fanatics are drawn to Bitcoin in part because of a bizarrely deep anger at the notion that units of their functional currency -- usually dollars -- are being inflated.<p>(Ignore for the moment that, though the dollar did decline in value from 2002 to 2008, it's actually not clear what it's currently doing; it may be experiencing deflation itself.)<p>The irritating and incorrect thing about this anger is that nobody's forced to hold the currency that they're upset at.  Even for ""fiat currency"" that needs to be used to pay taxes or offset debts, nothing requires that it be held long-term and thus subject any individual to inflation.  Choosing to experience inflation in a government's currency is thus, in all modern governments, an investment choice like any other investment choice.  Many people hedge against inflation, and it's very easy for any even moderately aware investor to do this.  The argument that Bitcoin's needed even partly because people have no way to avoid the oppressive inflation of a corrupt regime is, basically, economic, financial, and political nonsense.",1307108746

And given that most of the edge cases are likely to involve 90, 180 or 270 degrees of rotation, the additional computational requirements to cover those would appear to be significantly less than required for true non-translational calculation  - i.e. wouldn't rotating the low frequency image 90 degrees and generating a second hash + creating reverse order hashes of the original and second hash work?<p>It seems to me that for applications such as cryptography where the costs of false positives are high, a SIFT algorithm makes sense. But for a free consumer oriented search tool, might it be considered overkill?<p>Link to SIFT:

For performance, a modern compiler is going to destroy you 99% of the time -- I've been writing x86 assembly for many years and in the vast majority of cases, I can't write faster code than MSVC.  However, if code <i>size</i> is what's important, it's easy to beat any compiler.  You can often get your code down an order of magnitudes, sometimes even two.  Sizecoding has become my passion in recent years, and it's amazing how much you can do that the compiler can't if you really care; for instance, this is a bootsector I wrote that reads a kernel from NTFS: <a href=""http://demoseen.com/ColorblindBoot.s.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demoseen.com/ColorblindBoot.s.txt</a>  As far as I know, this is the only NTFS reader that actually fits into the boot sector (510 bytes, of which it uses every one), which is kinda neat.",1307108457

A job well done on a project hardly can compare the moments you capture with your spouse or your children. 
I think from some of the comments, it could be that you just haven't reach the point in your life that this difference becomes apparent. I would have never guessed before having children that I could be so happy -- they are just entirely different emotions. I suspect a lot of folks under hospice care are old enough to recognize this difference, and regret spending their early years trying to earn their way to happiness, and missed their childrens youth.

That may sound like a dismissive and superficial stance to take... but it happens to be the most honest out there.<p>There is a key aspect of knowing something in terms of a rigorous scientific understanding that is forgotten so often in conversations about it that it just drives me insane.  In any experiment with a control, all your other variables have to be fixed...<p>... or you don't know shit.<p>Now apply this to the bitcoin debate.  Let's take it for granted that deflation in a debt, fiat, gold based currency system is a bad... bad thing.  We're going to grant it for the sake of argument.<p>Well - you still don't know crapola about whether or not deflation in a bitcoin based currency system is bad.  For there are key differences in each case.  Once you move from any of these to bitcoin, certain variables flip.<p>In a debt based currency system, deflation amounts to the actual destruction of available cash in the system.  That's the chief reason why deflation is so bad for our economies.  If you get to the point where we're at now where the system can't soak up any more debt, then your deflation becomes a real problem since you no longer have any means to create the inflation you need to stimulate growth.<p>But deflation in bitcoin does NOT entail cash destruction.  For that is fixed by the algo.  So here is a key difference.  And it's just one of many I could mention for this case.<p>In a fiat based currency system - where a government prints the money (as opposed to having a central bank buy government debt) - any deflation can be offset easily because printing more money is not limited to debt saturation.  Bitcoin is just not comparable to this kind of system for this reason.  We need to compare it to systems where deflation is a real possibility.<p>Maybe it's closest to a gold backed system?  Maybe.  But there are flipped variables here too.  Gold is not infinitely divisible.  It can't be exchanged with any degree of ease like bitcoin can... etc...<p>Now of course, a little bit of a priori speculation is all well and good, and a necessary part of hypothesis formulation.  But for heaven's sake stop getting into these discussions under the pretext of actually knowing anything.<p>The article is essentially right.  We don't know.

There's <i>going</i> to be a clean-slate development approach put forth as the recommended way to develop for 8. There's no way around that.<p>It'll almost certainly look a lot like current Windows development (likely just a new iteration of Silverlight and .Net).  And just as certainly, legacy apps will stick around in a sort of ""XP Mode"" for x86 Win8, but they're going to be phased out.<p>If MS isn't talking yet, it's probably just because they have a new slew of buzzwords and marketing to finish drafting before they introduce it.",1307106115

As soon as they began taking on the role of curation or reporting on top of their cache of data, that's when things really took off (according to Assange).",1307106070

I've buried both inlaws and my father since late January this year.  When you lose your health, you also lose the little things in life from a very real perspective.  You can't hang with your friends any more.  Your free time evaporates because of all of the doctor visits.  You may need help getting there.  Also, the idea of spontaneous activity becomes a memory, because you have to plan yours around medication and appointments.  And, of course, that affects the plans of those who love you (although they will deny it).",1307106040

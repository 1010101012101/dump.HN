3217126,comment,3216580,3216836,7,0,yelsgib,,,"If you lived next to a diamond mine, you probably wouldn't buy diamond rings. I say this because I assume you are a compassionate/empathetic person to some degree, and I think it would be very difficult for you to separate out your feelings towards the terrible conditions/bloodshed involved in diamond mining and the shining ring that you just bought from the smiling slave-driver. The only reason that you could ever be comfortable buying such a ring is that you are far removed from the suffering involved in your purchase.<p>There are two complicating factors here: visibility and paucity of influence. You can't see the bad thing happening and you, individually, don't have the power to stop it.<p>The interaction between visibility and morality is a complicated one, but the fact is that if people in the most affluent nations boycotted diamonds then diamond mining would cease. If people boycotted Coca-Cola and Fiji spring water then villagers would get their water back.<p>The fact that you can't control these situations also complicates things. You can stop buying Coca Cola but, unless everyone else does to, CC is just going to just keep on stealing resources.<p>I think that the thing I really dislike about your comment is that you have the audacity to condemn the wrongs committed, but lack the integrity to acknowledge that you play, at least, some very small part in those wrong things happening. Because you do. If you don't buy that diamond ring then that is real $$$ that the diamond miners don't get. The hole created by your boycott has a non-zero probability of shutting down a diamond mine. The fact is that you don't care. I'm not saying you should - I'm just saying you don't. And the people doing these ""wrong"" things don't care either. Perhaps you could say that you would do differently in their situation, but my guess is that you are REALLY not in their situation and you have no idea what their situation is AT ALL.<p>I get it. You're in a comfortable position. There's no reason for you to change. You probably don't care enough about people in China, etc. that you're actually going to significantly, or even insignificantly, change your day to help them out. In fact, it's not even clear that you can. This may sound like a criticism, but I really don't care what you do.<p>The main element missing from your comment is the answer to ""what to do?"" My guess is that your answer is ""Nothing. There are bad people elsewhere, and I'm not to blame, so I do nothing. Let them figure it out."" I guess I hope this isn't actually your answer and that you realize that it's a lot more complicated. These people are ""unscrupulous"" not because they're full of demons, but because globalization exerts pressure and men sacrifice their better intentions when faced with that pressure.",1320868783

You see, without any context of changes or explanations for the mistakes that have been made and corrected, I as a viewer may as well just wait for the final product - as the learning is limited.<p>If this was with programming (a potential target use) for example, I may be none the wiser why the person writing the code suddenly deleted a chunk of code and replaced it with something else, unless of course some annotation / narration was provided to accompany the replay.<p>Don't take this as a negative point, the idea is great, but I think it could be far more useful with this added feature.",1320868681

And I could go on.  Huh.  Okay, I guess the only things that are ""proprietary"" are the authoring tool (although you're welcome to make your own) and some very important parts of the actual Flash Player (if Adobe had open sourced the player 5 years ago, we wouldn't even be having this conversation).<p>""The full web.""\nFlash is still an important part of the full web.  There's a lot of stuff that you will just never be able to do with the browser alone (capture video, do p2p networking, etc.) or that will be so difficult to implement amongst the many competing browsers that it's only economically feasible for giant companies to develop web applications.  But Apple doesn't want web applications to be able to compete with the capabilities of native apps that they make a profit on in their app store.\n""Touch""\nAdobe's APIs for Touch work pretty well, but they require developers to update their applications. Not particularly hard (compared to porting a flash game to Obj-C anyway).<p>True:\n""reliability, security, and performance""\nEnough said.\n""Battery life.""\nSoftware based rendering of graphics and decoding of video is obviously going to be way harder on battery life.\nMiddleman lock-in\nApple was burned in the past by this, but it doesn't seem like that much of a threat now.",1320866012

Specifically, they're looking for individuals with a focus on creating back-end systems that can scale to millions of users.  If you like to architect systems, have a background in low-level languages, and like working on the database and business logic layers then we want to hear from you. Our team is comprised of top design, front-end, and industry talent.  We're backed by investors with a solid track record picking winners.  Our market is $10B, has grown 25% yearly for fifty years, and is undergoing massive disruption right now.\nIn short, they're looking for amazing people to join their great team in a huge market solving tough problems that will be used by millions to change the world -- and we play Starcraft. What more could you ask for?\nTheir technical challenges aren't easy, and neither is joining their team.  But if you think you have what it takes we'd love to hear from you.<p>What they're looking for:<p>We are looking for backend engineers. We want persons who have worked on low-level languages, have architected systems, or otherwise have built things from scratch that scaled. If you think elegant, well-documented code is as beautiful as anything you'd find in a museum then you're the type of person we want.<p>We are not looking for accidental hackers. We want people who have written their own framework, rather than used one to create a website. We don't specifically require a CS degree, but we generally expect to see one in a backend engineer. A great candidate will be able to point to a body of work used by others or accepted pull requests on Github (ie, not just lots of forks.) Inflated titles like CTO are not impressive to us; a well-followed blog or project is.<p>Above all, we want A players. Our standards are very, very high but we are at the very early stages and want high-quality talent that will attract other high-quality talent.<p>We are a Python/Django shop. We trust the right engineer will not have a problem switching to these but without knowledge of either the hiring process will be very difficult.<p>Tools<p>We don't have religion on tools. Our basic principle is to use the simplest tool that will get the job done. While things may change, you should have a good understanding of the following:<p><pre><code>    Amazon Web Services\n            EC2 for front-end servers\n            S3 for serving content\n            RDS for backend MySQL databases\n\n    Redis\n            Use for our newsfeed and other streams\n\n    Python\n            We use Django for our front-end CRUD\n            twisted (for our asynch API)\n</code></pre>\nIf you feel that you meet these requirements, please drop me a line at aaron.lara@zelos.com or call me at 925-300-7524",1320865853

Macros are one of the ways out of this mess that we've created for ourselves.

At one time features were being added to database systems you could build command-line interfaces for the end-users.  These days the database is mostly just used as a storage engine.<p>Not that I really care about ""back in the day!""  But it can be helpful to understand why certain things were done in a certain way.  It seems like ancient history, but there you definitely will find some old code when you start working at companies that have been around for more than a few years.",1320865385

Certain things were broken that used to work fine. The only support allowed is to sign into my account on their website and use a feedback form. Email support is not allowed, nor is there a product forum. When I filled in the form it told me that I was not a registered user of version 2, therefore support was not available. So then I went and wrote a scathing public review advising people to avoid the product for specific reasons.<p>Compare that to another product I have and seldom use which I also wanted to check the upgrade out. I tried the demo, and there were essential features missing. I emailed the developer using the link in the program and explained myself. He wrote back saying that feature would be added in version 3 and I could upgrade 1 to 3 when it comes and skip 2, no problem. And so that was the end of it for now.",1320865375

Put a big ""contact"" button in your app, make it easier to give them direct feedback to you instead of in the app store.<p>And, obviously, don't release software that's not ready for production. The mindset ""we'll just release without proper testing, the users will point out the bugs"" - is so 1995",1320865309

This isn't really Google's fault though -- but did make the Dear Sophie ad a little confusing due to this legal restriction. Presumably you have to sign up using your own age since it is an account managed by you. When your child turns 13 you can transfer the account to them.<p>GMail users are not subject to any Real Name policies. Nice straw-man, though. It probably eluded most.",1320865305

Current work is concentrated mostly on making nuclear plant as passive as possible, resulting in graceful shutdown in the event of supporting equipment failure. This involves finding a coolant that behaves predictably and nicely when various subsystems go down (water does not).<p>Additional reading:\n<a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/423307/newer-nuclear-reactors-might-not-have-failed-in-japan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/423307/newer-nuclear-re...</a>\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety</a>",1442912306

10257444,comment,10256702,10256702,0,0,ivanr,,,"I quite like the idea of TinyCert and often wanted to do something similar myself. Although creating a private CA is not a lot of work initially, maintaining it is a hassle, especially when you&#x27;d rather be doing something else. TinyCert could be useful for development teams (and other similar non-security-critical uses) to get rid of self-signed certificates altogether.<p>However, for me, the fact that they have all the private keys is a deal breaker. Further, I&#x27;d like to see the certificates name-constrained to specific development hostnames. And I don&#x27;t like the fact that the keyUsage and extendedKeyUsage fields are not locked down. If I am going to install a private CA root, I want to have the smallest possible attack surface.<p>Overall, if they offer this as something that can be locally installed, it could be a useful product.

I occasionally use them to connect backend services securely, so I have to install the root cert to every server OS and every JVM based app (here we create a keystore). Then I have to install each private key and certificate to the appropriate service. If the service is JVM based we also have to adjust its command line switches. Should a private key get stolen and we have one root CA for all services, we should delete and recreate everything. PKI is complex and with tens or hundreds of services its almost impossible to manage.

Basically the killer app of F-35 is providing better situational awareness to the whole coalition force operating in the area. It&#x27;s much more valuable as a force multiplier than on its own.

I live in a coal mining town that also has a coal-fueled power and heating plant - the number of people who suffer in some way due to this is also huge. People get lung disease due to coal dust. In winter, everything is literally covered in soot - snow is blackish, with dark dots on everything. Pretty much every house was damaged in some way by the mine - most had their walls split at least once. There are lakes around the city which are contaminated with mining water - salty solution pumped from the mine - it&#x27;s prohibited to swim in it or grow any produce near it. And there&#x27;s plenty of places like that in the entire country.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that the author still calls nuclear energy dangerous, especially since he comes from the same country I do.

There are only two colors - white and black.<p>Only the very center of the image (where the number is) needs to be updated for each frame. This area is 400x65 pixels, so up to 26,000 pixels could be updated on each frame, minus the space between the numbers, etc., so I&#x27;d guesstimate an average of 10,000 pixels changing each frame.<p>Each of those 10,000 pixels can actually only be one of two values, but each occupies exactly one byte when uncompressed. So uncompressed (which GIFs normally are not), it&#x27;d be about 481,402,880,000 bytes (~0.5TB), plus the full first frame.<p>However, GIFs use LZW compression. While I do not know a lot about it, I would guess it would probably do quite well in this case. Perfect 100% compression would mean 1 bit per pixel rather than 8. But let&#x27;s assume LZW would only manage - say - 2 bits per pixel. That&#x27;d quarter the total size, making the total about 120GB.<p>Of course, this all assumes that it is actually a single GIF, which I believe is extraordinarily unlikely. I would expect it&#x27;s actually rendered on the fly.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m also assuming that the overall image is actually 1280x960 as the image in the article suggests.",1442909731

I certainly was ridiculing the viewpoint that political correctness has gone overboard.<p>I personally think ridicule is the right response to that sort of complaint.<p>My intent was to ridicule the idea, though, not the previous poster.  Especially considering how the previous poster framed it as &quot;some people think...&quot;   which is a less personal, and I think better way of arguing.  I think my personal anecdotes (for example, where I mentioned that I work in an industry where I get a large advantage for being white and male)  are a weakness of my debate style; they tend to make debates more personal, more emotional and, in my opinion, less interesting.<p>I would argue that ridicule is different from bullying, especially when that ridicule is directed at an idea rather than at a person.<p>But... I could also see how you could make the argument that ridiculing an idea is ridiculing the people who hold that idea.   And ridiculing a person is certainly a component of bullying.  So maybe it was bullying? But I also think of Bullying as a pattern of abuse directed towards a particular person, and I&#x27;m certainly not doing that<p>I do have plenty of friends who are openly racist and/or sexist, and while I do ridicule their ideas (and yes, to their faces, I&#x27;m not afraid to call people out.)  they&#x27;re still friends, so make of that what you will.",1442908970

The Republicans could field a decent president if they 1. recognized what a spectacular embarrassment and failure GWB was, and that we&#x27;re not going to elect anyone who is remotely connected to him, and 2. quit letting the crazy wing of their party run things.   I mean, there are crazies on both sides, but when it comes time to elect a president, you pick a centrist you think might be acceptable to the other side, too.<p>But that aside, yeah, I just don&#x27;t see how asking you to use one word instead of another to describe a person or a group makes you gagged or incapable of dealing with reality.",1442908951

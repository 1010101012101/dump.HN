But if you are (rightly and accurately) timid, you're less likely to.<p>One might think that bullshitting only works with people, and that if you act over-confident/over-optimistic with the computer, it won't be impressed - but it <i>is</i>. When I've approached programming problems is an aggressive way, I learn more, see better solutions and perform better. There's still a need to clean up the disasters afterwards, and it does make me feel dumb to make mistakes - but it's a more effective way of learning. For me, timidity is a mistake.<p>Being so timid that I don't try anything until I understand it 100% perfectly is not as effective. But I do like timidity. It's more authentic and accurate.<p>PS: @nostrademons: that confirms something I wondered about you... :-)",1244872654

Not <i>all</i> hackers are lisp/fp-hackers.<p>Of course, I understand that that's the domain you have, and your starting point is ""what to do with it' - so you have to use it! And it's quite alright with me if your site is targeting lisp-hackers only. And it may be that the interests of lisp and non-lisp hackers substantially (or maybe totally) overlap. And, for example, the name ""Y-combinator"" doesn't seem to have done any harm.<p>PS: I do about 3-6 hours vi per day when typing, but most of my ""coding"" is done on paper or in the shower. <i>Do I count as a hacker?

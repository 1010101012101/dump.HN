Image based systems (like Common Lisp) are particularly nice because you can just recompile the functions that have changed and have the changes instantly take effect on a running image. Unfortunately, ASDF (the most common build/packaging system) doesn't have particularly good support for incremental builds yet, but it's an area of active developement (particularly with XCVB and other new build systems).<p>But don't GCC, Java, and Visual Studio all support parallel builds pretty easily? I've never looked into it, but I know I've read articles about it.<p>What sort of language/env. does FogCreek use? I vaguely remember hearing that they had written their own compiler in Java that transformed ASP to PHP or some other such ludicrous thing.<p>Edit: Some googling showed that they decided their software had to run on Windows and Unix boxes, and that the best way to do that was to support ASP (pre .NET) on Windows and PHP on *nix. They already had a large ASP code base, so they wrote a compiler (named Thistle) that could translate a subset of ASP into PHP. Then, it seems like MS deprecated ASP (and they started to realize how much it sucked) so they wrote their own language (Wasabi) that is based on VBScript and can be compiled into ASP, PHP, or JS. My God. I would gouge my eyes out if I had to work there. From the fragments of code I've seen, it frankly seems horrible.

But what if it was possible to match against any feature within the source image, rather than the exact, entire source image you search for?<p>For each image in the index, break it up into 4x4 tiles, then store a hash code for each tile.  Then repeat the process, but offset the boundary of each tile by 1px along the X axis.  Repeat 2 more times.  Then, for each offset along the X axis, offset down along the Y axis.  So you store 16 hashes per 4x4 pixel area.<p>Now, when someone searches for an image, repeat that hashing algorithm for the source image.  The results page then returns any image that contains a 4x4 tile that is also contained in the source image, ranked by the number of tiles within the image that is common between the source and result image.<p>The end result is that you can see how the features within an image are used in other images -- so if someone takes the red stapler from Office Space ( <a href=""http://www.yunasville.com/img/102005/milton.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yunasville.com/img/102005/milton.jpg</a> ) and puts it into a different image, and you search for that red stapler, the results page will still return the photoshopped image, because it'll match the 4x4 tiles on the stapler in both images.<p>I've explained this in a convoluted way, but hopefully I've communicated the essence of the idea.<p>On one hand, there will be more results to filter through, and it's more computationally expensive.

535921,comment,535675,535837,0,0,rkts,,,"Kool-Aid-free answer:<p>""Functional programming"" can mean one of three things.<p>1. <i>Higher-order programming</i>: the use of higher-order functions to make code more general/compact.  Since you know Ruby, you're already doing some higher-order programming, but you may not understand it well enough to take full advantage of it.  The best way to learn higher-order programming is to read SICP.<p>2. The use of <i>immutable (aka persistent, nondestructive) data structures</i>, i.e. data structures that can be updated without mutation.  For example, linked lists allow you to prepend an element without changing the original list.  This makes code cleaner in some cases and has advantages for concurrency.  For specifics, look up Clojure.<p>3. <i>Functional purity</i>, aka <i>referential transparency</i>: the property that, for any input <i>x</i>, a function must always produce the same output <i>x'</i>.  That is, all functions must be functions in the mathematical sense of the word.  In practice, this doesn't really mean eliminating impure functions, but rather partitioning your program into ""provably pure functions"" and ""possibly impure functions,"" using a clever hack (monads) to ensure that the output of possibly-impure functions is invisible to the provably-pure ones.<p>So, supposing you had a pure function whose behavior you wanted to randomize, you couldn't just throw in a call to the random() function, but would also have to convert it and all the functions that depend on it into impure (monadic) functions, replacing all function calls with the bind operator (>>=).  It's quite complicated and I have never found a reason to believe it's a good idea, other than some theoretical stuff about ""safety"" and compiler optimizations that make your program 2% faster.  I suggest not wasting your time on it.",1238199320

Like Men are Mortals, Socrates is a man, so Socrates is mortal. So Mortals could be the superclass, men could be the subclass, and Socrates could be an instance of the subclass men, and would be a member of superclass Mortals. But it would be nice to have a way of defining these classes at runtime, so in a chatbot if the user posed such a scenario to the chatbot, the chatbot could use some pattern matching, construct the classes on the fly, and figure out the relations, thereby sounding ""intelligent"". Can this be done? Classes made at runtime instead of compile time?",1238198971

The nature of our business requires either capital to contract out graphics work or have a graphic designer on board.  Since we have no capital we have been looking for a graphic designer.  Ideally it would be another student, but we have been unable to find anyone.  The other option is contracting out, but since we are college students thats not really an option.

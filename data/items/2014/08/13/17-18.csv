The most telling was when I sliced open the back of my hand with an industrial fan. We cleaned and bandaged it, then applied ice, and I sat until the pain subsided and felt good enough to go the nearest clinic.<p>By the time I arrived, the pain and nausea had returned, but no biggie. I presented my healthcard and described the situation, which caused the three people behind the counter to pause and eye me as one asked &quot;But you didn&#x27;t break the skin, right?&quot;<p>I did not get a chance to complete my reply, which started with &quot;Yes, of course...&quot;. &quot;Drop your card, come with me now&quot;.<p>The waiting room was more than half full, but I was priority number 1 for the next 15 minutes. A nurse carefully, delicately removed the dressing, then used a thin metal instrument to ever so carefully widen the cut and examine the tissue underneath. When satisfied, she sent me back to the waiting room where I sat for an hour and half.<p>I learned the full story when I returned for an x-ray the next day (I hurt myself on a Sunday, the basement x-ray lab was closed): Had I severed - or even cut - any of the tendons leading to my fingers, I would have rushed to the hospital to save my hand before the tendons shrank and dried into uselessness.<p>I didn&#x27;t mind the 1.5 hour wait on the Sunday, or the combined 1.5 hours on the Monday, because when it came to what really mattered, there was no wait at all.<p>They only took my healthcard once the initial careful inspection was over.

This seems to be a completely plausible claim, and that would be a reason why many American voters or leaders of countries allied to the United States might desire the current leadership of NSA to resign and be replaced with more competent leaders.<p>There is a troubling problem with any increase in government firepower: be it heavy weaponry in our police stations, advanced monitoring capabilities that can be used on the entire populace at once, or drones that can hit targets on the other side of the planet.<p>What happens when these weapons are used against us?<p>Let&#x27;s just assume for a minute that our government has our best interests in mind and is basically benevolent. With a database of potential intelligence against every person in the US, you create a dangerous situation: what happens if the Chinese or Russian government has covert access to this system and strategically leaks information with the purpose of influencing US elections? This feels completely plausible in my mind: there are real risks to having so much information available in one place. The fact that the controls were so weak to begin with makes me almost certain that foreign intelligence has continued access to these databases.<p>Every weapon we develop can potentially be used against us. In the case of cyberwarfare, those weapons can be used against us without our knowledge. The scariest part of Snowden&#x27;s leaks is how awful the government is at technology: most people on the Internet were pretty sure the government was spying on everyone anyway. Geopolitics gets messy, so that stuff is forgivable. But when a single government contractor is able to walk away with so much information and they don&#x27;t even know what he has?",1407950825

The screen cracked in the top corner.  I tentatively touched the screen, to see if the crack was dangerous.  I did not cut my finger, but did succeed in transferring a very small piece of glass to my finger.<p>People touch their eyes frequently, often unconsciously.<p>Six hours later, after attempting self-irrigation on the plane and at the airport, I was at a hospital in Chicago seeing an eye doctor.  Time from arrival at proper floor to being taken to room: three minutes (&quot;glass in eye&quot; cuts down on paperwork quite a bit).  Time to arrival of doctor: approximately four minutes after that.<p>They successfully treated me for, possible misquote, &quot;non-traumatic introduction of a foreign body to the eye.&quot;  (The attending physician&#x27;s first words, after reading the chart, were &quot;How in God&#x27;s name does an iPad screen end up in your eye?&quot;)<p>Treatment was approximately 15 minutes of a resident&#x27;s time and 5 minutes of the attending physician&#x27;s time plus one cotton swap and some iodine.<p>Total cost: approximately $300, plus twenty minutes of dealing with the billing clerk (after approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the billing clerk to be ready).<p>Most of the time with the billing clerk was a result of the clerk getting the run-around from a Japanese commercial travel insurance company.  I customarily travel with private insurance which, among other things, covers me for medical emergencies while traveling.  (Normally I&#x27;m covered by Japanese national insurance, which doesn&#x27;t normally cover treatment of Americans in America for all the obvious reasons.)

Programmers are capable of writing rigid programs in any language but I do feel in my little experience of using FP languages it is harder to do so, or more obvious when you are doing so. I&#x27;ll give it a try anyway.<p>I think the modularity comes from most FP languages having fewer building blocks to work with than most OO languages. It&#x27;s the same reason why users of OO languages with a ton of different building blocks (Java, C#, etc.) find more &quot;minimalist&quot; OO languages like Ruby refreshing. FP languages tend to take this simplicity even further. You essentially have just functions and modules (a place to group related functions). FP languages also usually don&#x27;t have state, unless you want to emulate that in your program somehow.<p>To me it is about ditching the OO way of creating some representation of the circle of life or Kingdom of Classes hierarchy in your applications for just treating your program as data that goes through a sequence of transformations. Linear programs are always easier for me to understand than hierarchies.<p>Rich Hickey&#x27;s Simple Made Easy[0] talk is a great overview of the subject. Now his talk isn&#x27;t about modularity per se, but I think modularity is one of the many things that fall out of simplicity.<p>0 - <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1407949935

Right now our economic system is predicated on rewarding those who deserve wealth (as judged by ability or hard work). The converse of that is that we as a society accept that the undeserving (stupid and/or lazy) will be punished economically.  We rationalize this because we convince ourselves that it was their own fault, therefore it&#x27;s &quot;fair&quot;  . But what happens when intelligent, hard-working -- and therefore deserving -- people are unemployable? It&#x27;s going to be a massive shock to people and to the system.

If you just have a slow growing self-contained app, then monolith is probably the way to go.<p>If you have an app that has the potential to grow quickly, or is already integrating with multiple external services, it may make sense to look at microservices.<p>We switched from monolith to SOA a couple of years ago, and it&#x27;s been a net win in terms of price, reliability of site performance, and ease of development. There were the obvious drawbacks you stated above of network timeouts, lag, and async issues, but it&#x27;s just a different set of problems.",1407949277

I don&#x27;t know, you gotta try right?<p>That said, Dart seems to have an easier time with people who come from languages other than JavaScript or with people who only briefly learned JavaScript to do some stuff and wonder why they have to avoid 90% of the language and every library out there uses a slightly different not completely compatible set of conventions to emulate classes, promises, packages …",1407949243

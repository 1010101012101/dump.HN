The sugars in fruits will have higher concentrations of simple glucose (though they still have plenty of fructose) than a soda does.  Fructose and Sucrose (depending on what is state-subsidized where you live) are likely the only sweetener in sodas, and they require extra processing (by insulin and others) to be useful.<p>Usually the body transforms Fructose/Sucrose into lipids instead of consuming them on the spot like simple glucose.  I suppose the body is trying to save the sub-standard fuel for when it has no other choice.  Not sure what this has to do with cancer, but I suppose if there are too many insulin needs in the body that the pancreas will break down eventually (and cells turn into cancer sometimes instead of dying when they wear out in rare cases).",1265671461

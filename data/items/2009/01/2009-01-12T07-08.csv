430268,comment,428785,429754,0,0,grandalf,,,"I consider the government one of those ""large, centralized power structures"".  It has its pluses and minuses.  At present I pay it thousands of dollars every month to help fund a massive war in the middle east and an enormous bailout of Wall Street and Detroit.  If I stop doing this I will be put in prison.<p>Dow Chemical is one other such organization, as is General Motors, as is Google, as is Canada, etc.<p>Why do you presuppose that it is necessary to diminish the power of some of these organizations?<p>I would argue that one of the main reasons that corporate interests become ""large, centralized power structures"" is because they are able to manipulate government regulation to their advantage.<p>There was a Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders talk where one guy said how much he loves starting companies in heavily regulated industries -- because there is such a high barrier to entry that once you do the extensive paperwork and legwork and politicking get approved there is very little competition.<p>The real ""sweet spot"" for firms is to be in a heavily regulated AND heavily protected industry (aka too big to fail).  The military industrial complex is one such example, as is the financial services industry (as of the past few months) and also now the US automotive industry.<p>So rather than viewing the world as one in which government protects me from these entities, I view it as one where these entities conspire to prevent revolutionary innovations from threatening their dominance.<p>Further evidence that countries do this is the big trend toward treaties to prevent ""tax competition"" between countries.  France doesn't want Poland luring companies in with low corporate taxes, etc.  This is blatant collusion.  Why are state taxes typically lower than Federal?  Not because state regulators aspire to less grand programs than Fedreal ones do, but because it's easy to move to a different state, not so easy to move to a different country.<p>Consider how many businesses spend more money on a presence in Washington DC than they do on innovation.  Google learned from Microsoft's mistake and now has an active office in DC trying to build influence -- and with Schmidt's appointment has the ultimate influence in the new administration.<p>To maintain its status as legitimate, one of these entities, government, must constantly reinforce its own story through pageantry and pomp.  Did you know that George W. Bush conducted more ceremonies than any other president?<p>We're supposed to believe that all other ""powerful, centralized power structures"" are evil (various companies, Saddam's Iraq, Castro's Cuba) and that the only hope lies in unquestioning, unthinking loyalty to the US government.  We're taught to see all regulation only as the ""grand vision"" associated with it, not as a law that creates incentives, winners, and losers.  We're taught to fear and to trust.  We're given black and white messages like ""good and evil"", etc.<p>I just refuse to believe this.  I live in a country where ""The Patriot Act"" takes away rights and where the financial services industry -- for quite a while the biggest industry donor to both major parties -- gets a massive bailout from the Treasury department.  We live in a place where eating according to the USDA food pyramid will lead to heart disease while benefiting the dairy and beef and corn industries.<p>Why do I not just think we should strive to improve regulations against ""evil corporations""?  I think people are capable of processing information and using basic cognition.  In many cases, such as the SEC, regulations only lead to a false sense of security.  Isn't it a bit crazy that in the same period that Madoff's firm conducted the biggest scam ever, the SEC was warned of this by multiple parties and instead chose to shut down prosper.com on a technicality?<p>I'm not anti-government, but I would like to see more competition -- in the form of more being handled at the state level so that we can see the effects of multiple approaches to solving the same problem, as well as move to a different state if we find its regulatory environment preferable.",1231746582

You are being interrogated and judged on how well they think you can actually be trusted with a security clearance(along with other factors in your application).

430252,comment,428785,429683,0,0,mindviews,,,"I think you mistook my comment as an argument against Libertarianism - it was not intended to be such.  My point was that people oversimplify both the implementation and the analysis of Libertarian principles.  A system with many, many free actors can be amazingly complex, and what I'm suggesting is that for people to see the value of the system they need to recognize and embrace that complexity.<p>For example, the basic principles of a free market (e.g., supply and demand) are easy to state but result in complex transactions.  When things don't ""work out"" for someone in the real work and they raise an argument against ""free markets"" (as in the current housing bubble), we need to be ready to point out all the complex ways that the free market worked correctly but where the non-free parts distorted it (government policies encouraging loans to unqualified applicants).<p>In complex systems with non-linear behavior, we need to be very careful that we understand the full context of an event or we won’t be able to extrapolate the results.  That’s why first-order approximations fail so often in mathematics and in real life.",1231744973

On twitter, favorites are tantamount to me printing out my browser's bookmarks list and posting it on my front door.<p>FF likes communicates that you are interested in an item to the FF system, the poster, and other people who come across it.  Activity on things you like reset their freshness (for you) so you don't need to go hunting for things that have had activity.  The poster can immediately see if people are tracking activity on something, and get a feel for other's responses to their entries.  And as for other people seeing who has liked what, I've found other interesting people to follow more closely based on their name showing up in the like list.  When start seeing someone's name pop up often, it's a way to learn what they are interested in (other than from their own posts, of course).",1231744930

430245,comment,428785,428915,0,0,grandalf,,,"Capitalism and human nature tell us that lobbying and corruption will be a consequence of regulation.  Libertarians simply realize that regulations are not just the ""grand vision"" that they are presented as... they create winners and losers, beneficiaries and those who are made worse off. As such libertarians constantly re-evaluate how effectively regulations accomplish the grand vision in the environment of the perverse incentives that are often created and grow over time.<p>At a very basic level this is simply a scientific, non-political world view.  It's evidence-based. If you read through many of the threads on HN you can feel the deep sentimentality that people feel about things like Social Security, etc.  It's an emotional, irrational, unscientific response.<p>Why are you critical of libertarianism?  Do you support some special interest group that stands to lose simply from smaller government?  Or are you sentimentally attached to the grand vision presented as the persuasive argument for some piece of historical regulation?  Or are you a career burocrat :)",1231744528

I usually visit the link first then come back to the comments on Hacker News.

For me if a discussion needs to happen, it should be where the people found the link.

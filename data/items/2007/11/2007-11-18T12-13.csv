More importantly though, do what you would do for free, having passion for what you do is the most important thing. I love what I do; I'm not even that busy. I got a total of five phone calls all day yesterday and one of them was a wrong number. Ms. B from NFM had passion, that's why she was successful. A few months ago I was talking to another MBA student, a very talented man, about 30 years old from a great school with a great resume. I asked him what he wanted to do for his career, and he replied that he wanted to go into a particular field, but thought he should work for McKinsey for a few years first to add to his resume. <i>To me that's like saving sex for your old age. It makes no sense.</i><p><a href=""http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/clubs/investment/WarrenBuffett.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/clubs/investment/WarrenB...</a>

81193,comment,80915,80915,0,0,icky,,,"The trick with MVC is to realize that it's not some immutable magic spell, it gives results by enforcing a separation of concerns:  data-modeling (and its manipulation and constraints) in the model, control-flow (and selecting and ordering the data to be presented) in the controller, and rendering it a certain way in the view.<p>If you, as you suggest, have the view (essentially a glorified HTML template) request the data it needs (e.g. from multiple sources), then your data-selection and visual-presentation become tightly coupled. (The point of a view is that you can have <i>multiple</i> views of the same data).  If the original view is handling things like data-selection and complex control flow, then when you want to create an alternate presentation of the same data, you'll end up copy-and-pasting code (c.f. ""Don't Repeat Yourself"").<p>So the best solution is to get a really good feel for separation of concerns, code-non-duplication, etc., and then   organize your code accordingly. When using MVC, use every bit of it to keep your code simple and decoupled; if you just slap code into units called ""models"", ""views"", and ""controllers"" wherever you like, then you will receive NO BENEFIT (or negative benefit!) from using MVC.  But, used properly, it can be a powerful tool.",1195387628

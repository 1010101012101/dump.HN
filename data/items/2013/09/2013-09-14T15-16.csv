6385990,comment,6385468,6385866,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I could imagine hardware built to grab public keys, and I could imagine such in a general purpose computer.  However in the end there are a large number of problems so this is not a scenario to worry about. Yea, just generate the key and be done with it.<p>But the problems include:<p>1.  So suppose you build into a computer an effort to recognize some public key generation routines and intercept the key from memory.  This could be done, but updating the firmware code (since it is hidden from the user of the computer) is pretty hard so it only works on versions current at the time of manufacture.  If you have had the computer for a few years, such recognition would seem iffy.  Additionally this gets more complex when supporting more implementations....<p>2.  Ok, so the computer malhardware has got the key, so what can it do with it?  If you send the key over the internet, someone at some point may detect it.  Likely the best scenario would be to store it and wait for some attempted handshake on, say, a firewire port, and then send it out then.  Or one could wait for an SSH connection to an NSA-used cert for something like Google, but certs expire so that attack won&#x27;t be worth it.<p>Tinfoil mode is interesting but part of the benefits are thinking through the possible exposure of something like a compromised piece of hardware.<p>Again, suppose the RNG is compromised. usually this means one can guess future values based on past values.  An attack without past values is worthless, so it is unlikely to be helpful with regard to public key encryption as you point out.",1379174376

A feminist advocates or supports the rights and equality of women.[1] It&#x27;s not about superiority, simply equality.<p>I, as a male, have yet to read a piece of scholarly feminist literature that was based purely on misandry. In fact almost  all of the literature I&#x27;ve read argues against the conditions and cultural values that both men and women are exposed to that allow them to identify and carry out sexist behavior in a justified manner rather than simply blaming the individuals. Instead most asks that we all think critically of our own responsibility to others, what we value culturally and why we value it.<p>The &quot;rope ladder&quot; example you mention can be related to a &quot;BARGAINING WITH PATRIARCHY&quot;[2] where women who are invested in a patriarchal system and receive some benefits are less likely to give up those benefits even if it improves their own situation in the long term.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism</a>

One interesting thing about news coverage is it covers NEWS - stuff that is new or that happens rarely. Once you&#x27;ve seen something happen a thousand times before, it stops being news. Auto accidents, being common, don&#x27;t get national news coverage. High-profile kidnappings and large-bodycount school shootings, being much more rare, do.<p>The fact that news has this dynamic means you can&#x27;t take the amount of news coverage as an indication of how serious or common a problem is. We DO do that due to a cognitive error called &quot;availability bias&quot;, but if anything, the reverse strategy would be more sensible.<p>In short: if you see a threat in the newspapers, you should assume it&#x27;s news because it happens so rarely that it isn&#x27;t worth your worrying about anymore (if it ever was).",1379173966

The whole thing was 4 years where there was a steady availability of actual new developments: The race to try to find the baby; finding the body; the hunt for suspects in what was now a gruesome baby murder rather than &quot;just&quot; a kidnapping; the court case, with a suspect that insisted on his innocence; the execution, with a suspect that still insisted on his innocence.

This problem can only get worse as population density increases.<p>> At the same time, evidence shows better status and education yields fewer births.<p>That&#x27;s very true, there&#x27;s no dispute about that.

6385791,comment,6384181,6384654,1,0,vubuntu,,,"All of these are strong triggers of sleep apnea, if your jawbone, throat, body structure etc, already make you susceptible to sleep apnea. All of these worsen my sleep apnea condition.  I am starting to believe there is a strong connection between sleep apnea and these sleep paralysis episodes. Not that it cannot happen in other situations. But mainly here&#x27;s my conclusion<p>1) Sleep paralysis is your brain waking up before your body and experiencing the &#x27;unable to move&#x27; condition.<p>2) Lot of conditions can cause it. Mainly Insomnia, stress/sleeping-less due to work etc<p>3) Most folks who are saying that these episodes are not accompanied by irrationally terrifying &#x27;presence&#x27; feelings probably have no other health conditions<p>4) Sleep apnea is your brain not getting enough oxygen. 
    - Your brain goes into alarm/warning mode at some point and wants to force the body/mouth to change position so that you can start breathing normal again.
    - The way it does this is to try to wake you up, which results in most times you waking up short of breath, snoring very loud that it wakes you up. But in some cases, your body is very deep in sleep, so you first go through partially wake state...the sleep paralysis. 
   -  The brain is then further trying to wake you up fully, by recalling from memory things/experiences that have awaken you in the past - Someone bending over your face (your spouse giving you a good morning kiss) ,  some child running into your room (your kid running into your bedroom in the morning), sounds of walking steps (people walking in the morning close to you while you were partially awake, getting up), some frightening movie event/character that had made a strong impression on your brain in the past and which jolts you up (get adrenaline going, thus making your body recover from paralysis) etc.
   -  These experiences that the brain induces, would feel more terrifying if you were in a state of paralysis and could not move. Thus the irrational terror. Especially if you are also living alone.
    - I think loneliness also is a trigger, as I have had sleep apnea induced breathless wakeup episodes (on some days when I neglect to use my CPAP machine), when my wife is next to me, but so far never the irrational &#x27;presence&#x27; feeling when I am not alone. Even the sleep paralysis episodes are rare when my family is around. I just wake up straight short of breath when not using CPAP. But it is possible that my CPAP usage has improved my breathing. The last sleep paralysis episode I had was about 1.5 yrs ago when I was not yet using CPAP for my sleep apnea.<p>I have done this analysis so many times and very convinced that it is very likely to be accurate. But even then the fact that most people similar to me, have experienced &#x27;the ghost bending close to your face and breathing over you, the demonic child standing in the room or walking/running towards you, the sound of steps&#x27; is still irrationally terrifying. That is why I do not watch horror/supernatural  movies that much...to avoid giving more terror inducing fodder to my brain :)",1379171478

6385774,comment,6385265,6385265,1,0,spaboleo,,,"Yes, I agree with you that the way we manage our contact date is outdated.<p>The problems nowadays are:<p>1) If you include pseudonyms and literally all user data, you will earn the distrust of millions of users that don&#x27;t want this data centralized in the databases of one company. 
(I know it is possible to figure out almost all the interconnections e.g. via IP, Cookies, Location data, your browsing history. But still they are given implicit. Handing all your user data to one company firsthand plays in a totally different league.)<p>2) This system, especially the automatic updates via sent out API calls, requires deep integration in countless pieces of software. Windows, Mac, Linux and all their ways of managing contacts, the corresponding mobile systems need to adapt and what about the business sector?
You could counter that it is a standalone app and the user has the choice on every platform. And that would be the next problem. All the existing services (about.me, dooid.me, even the Gravatar, or even providing a downloadable or scannable .vcard file or QR-code on a self-hosted webpage) are not used by any majority of people. Why?  The majority simply does not submerge that deeply into the technology. 
Yet another service that bring yet more responsibilities (setting up privacy boundaries etc.) might be appealing to the techy-nerdy kind, but not at all to &quot;Joe Average&quot;.<p>3) What this would need is huge company&#x27;s backup. And to be honest, Google has had the chance...but they screwed it up. Google+. The idea behind the circles is great (hence the resemblance to your &quot;spheres&quot;?). But tying it to yet another social network and forcing it upon it&#x27;s users is not the way to build a user base that trusts and accepts the platform.
I don&#x27;t believe any piece of statistic released talking of 400 Million registered users (of course, because they force it upon the Google Play and YouTube users) or the 100 Million active users (of course, YouTube commenters, still want to comment). If I check my Google+ Stream it is dead to 95% of my contacts. There is less going on than on facebook. (Which we all apparently distrust and has seriously lost the contact management game.)<p>All this leads me to the conclusion that the introduction of an important functionality like the one you describes can&#x27;t be done by any kind of service.<p>It should become a &quot;protocol&quot;. Maybe a vcard-protocol. And in the best case a P2P based one that is encrypted. Why?
- My user data doesn&#x27;t change every second, so there is absolutely no need for 99,99% availability.
- Our smartphones are online almost 24/7 anyways. And in addition our various other internet access devices even increase that number ;)
- Ot the information could be circled around in the P2P-network, highly encrypted. As the data size of maybe a profile picture and a bunch of contact details is not really an issue, this actually would be feasible.
- It could be combined with PGP, maybe even use the very same keys. Which could and should increase the number of users encrypting their conversations.
- The information would not leave the users hands unencrypted. 
- The possibilities are defined by the protocol and the user has to set up allowances (sphere permissions) accordingly on the platform he uses.
- As you now can setup various IMAP mail accounts you could create various vcard-information snippets for all the various identities you want to manage.
- A unique ID of course is necessary, this could be used for the NFC/BT or just motion-sensor/timestamp/location based (&quot;bumping&quot;) handshake to exchange the information. The encrypted vcard-information package can of course be published directly or in form of a link/QR-code via NFC/BT/local Wifi.
- It should not be file based to the user.
- The encryption (I don&#x27;t know if PGP allows this) should be able to terminate itself if the user didn&#x27;t refresh the permission or didn&#x27;t prolong the availability.<p>The big problem is...how can a protocol like this be made attractive to be used.
One would need a group of manufacturers/companies, like Google with Android and it&#x27;s web-based contact database and Apple with iOS and it&#x27;s horrible contacts App.<p>The problem is...there is too much money in user-data...

Assistants, butlers, maids, chauffeurs, live-in nannies/governesses, dedicated gardeners, etc. are a very rare breed nowadays used by tiny numbers of ultra-rich, while a hundred years ago many &quot;upper-middle&quot; class specialists (doctors, lawyers, civil servants) employed other people for their personal needs.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s entirely the opposite - the rich don&#x27;t need or want the common people anymore, they can do almost without them; so they&#x27;re not associating with them and not redistributing the wealth to &quot;common laborers&quot; by paying for their services, almost all of the wealth is invested in capital not in labor.

It just sounds, let&#x27;s say interesting :-)<p>So, why is the pirate party not on the top with all the NSA turmoil? Well, basically they let slip any chance to exploit the topic for their benefit slip. They used to have an pretty good start with a not too weak stand at first. But then leadership and politics within the party started and the whole thing basically just started to crumble. They might have gotten over it with their new party lead, though I feel that girl just screams too much; at least their leadership and inner politics have subsided (or thats what you get as a bystander).<p>The whole NSA stuff has come up over the recent weeks and basically intensified--but that might be my biased reading as well--and the pirate party has not made any visible attempt to get hold of the issue, make statements, propose solution, ... nothing.<p>So what does the pirate party stand for? I&#x27;m not quite sure. At least I don&#x27;t feel like they are the ones who would ensure that the NSA spying would get thoroughly investigated as well as the general surveillance that is happening all over the place.<p>Neither seems any other party to be particularly interested in handling that topic. The two big parties CDU/CSU and SPD have their focus on other things. FDP seems to see a popular interest in the NSA/spying/surveillance, and tries to position itself. Though with the FDP this is always a gamble. Maybe they /really/ /really/ want to do something, but just can&#x27;t because they are always forces in a coalition? Or maybe they didn&#x27;t want to fix that in the first place, but pay lip service? DIE LINKE, well I don&#x27;t really know what to say about them. One thing though, their Gregor Gysi is a hell of a skilled speaker.<p>EDIT: Completely forgot about the Green party; they do seem to be interested in tackling the problem, though it&#x27;s just not their core competence.<p>Bottom line, I find it hard to single out a party that would truly attack the privacy issue.<p>EDIT: Thinking about it, it&#x27;s probably the imperative form leading into the sentence.

It repeats an old saw often repeated by people who don&#x27;t understand the Logistic function and its role is describing biological systems:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function</a><p>The Logistic function concisely describes the behavior of biological systems that don&#x27;t have any control over their numbers, as humans most certainly do not.<p>At the left, the function&#x27;s curve is nearly flat because there aren&#x27;t enough living organisms to support a higher birth rate.<p>At the right, the functions&#x27;s curve is nearly flat because <i>mass starvation and death prevents a higher birth rate</i>.<p>The Logistic function models a growing biological colony in a finite world, and it applies to any biological colony. For such a biological colony, eventually <i>mass birth is balanced by mass death</i>.<p>Does this model have any bearing on the human biological colony? Let me answer by saying as time passes, more and more accounts of mass death are met by less and less surprise or alarm among the world&#x27;s population.<p>At Sandy Hook, a boy has a fight with his mother, so -- being a healthy young boy, possessed of normal instincts -- he kills her, then goes to a local school and kills as many people as he can possibly manage. The story makes national headlines for a few days, all those innocent children systematically killed by an amateur, acting on a whim. But that story evaporates, pushed out the public&#x27;s consciousness by another story of mass death, and another.<p>By contrast, when the Lindbergh baby was kidnapped in March 1932, it made national headlines for years -- <i>years</i> -- until the perpetrator was apprehended, tried, and executed in 1936. It&#x27;s the story of one family, one child, one murder. Today that story wouldn&#x27;t be able to compete with the latest mass murder account. &quot;Oh, Bashar Assad has killed 1,500 people in a nerve gas attack. Oh, well, they&#x27;re not anyone I know personally. What else is in the news?&quot;<p>The author of the linked editorial concludes his article by saying, &quot;The only limits to creating a planet that future generations will be proud of are our imaginations and our social systems. In moving toward a better Anthropocene, the environment will be what we make it.&quot;<p>Both claims are likely, but with one important difference -- future populations will wonder what we were thinking, as we struggled to avoid considering the consequences of our own actions. As to &quot;the environment will be what we make it&quot;, that is certainly true -- we will gradually tolerate more and more mass death, a process that has already begun.<p>At the next Sandy Hook mass killing, people will say, &quot;Hey, what can you do? Boys will be boys. But this can&#x27;t be allowed to stand in the way of progress.&quot;",1379170896

Period.<p>""Fighting the system"" is a different can of worms. Being a revolutionary is also different. But Civil Disobedience means that you put civility -- the willingness to not fight -- at the same level as your moral outrage. Civil Disobedience is doing the right thing, being willing to take the consequences without a fight, and daring the public to put up with such an immoral system. The person who is being disobedient is asking ""How can our society continue in a practical way when we treat people this way?"" It's both a moral and a practical question. It's not just outrage.<p>It's an important distinction. I'm fine with revolutionaries, after all, the U.S. started with a revolution. But we were very clear in the Declaration of Independence the reasons for our taking up arms. We had a job to do, and the king had a job to do. The king wasn't doing his, and after trying our best to meet his demands, power then reverted to the natural legislature of the people.<p>This wasn't a moral crusade. This was a reluctant servant taking the only action possible.<p>If you want a moral crusade and a revolution, then you have to answer one key question: what makes you so right? After all, if we're talking morals, other people have morals too, and I betcha they're not going to agree with yours. What do we do? All get clubs and run out into the street and whoever wins gets to decide what's right? Been a lot of that going around, and it never ends well. Majorities don't decide the correct construction of a society that's going to last. All they get to do is bully folks into getting their way.<p>I can't make a call on Aaron because I have no idea what his intentions were, and the story never finished. So the reader is free to add whatever he would like onto it (one of the reasons it is so powerful, probably)<p>But I know from Civil Disobedience. Powerful concept. Poorly understood.<p>ADD: Was going to link to MLK's letter from a Birmingham Jail, but that might derail us. MLK put this in religious terms, ""So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?"", but the core of the question in my mind is not religious, it is this: how are we all going to continue getting along together if things continue like this?",1360259862

You could do similar things in Scheme, or CL, or even Python or Ruby.<p>What's cool about this isn't that we've managed to put functions in a data structure.  It's that doing this in a particular way allows us to describe computations in a declarative way.  This declarative specification opens up lots of interesting avenues to do new things with our code that weren't available before.<p>Of course the idea of declarative programming isn't new either, but we think this particular instantiation is cool because it's <i>extremely simple</i> and close to the language.  Writing a Graph doesn't feel any heavier than writing the corresponding non-declarative code, and this is crucial for making it actually useful in many kinds of situations (rather than just cases where heavy lifting is necessary, like distributed stream processing for example).",1360259787

They were clearly in talks with Yahoo! about being purchased (and potentially others as they were putting out surveys every few months about usage and purpose that I filled out each and every time), but didn't inform any of us that the site would literally be shut off late one day and we would be unable to retrieve (or even look at in read-only mode) all of the data we'd put on the site.<p>We were initially able to grab a PDF or HTML file of the links we'd posted, but none of the additional descriptions we'd place along with them. They told us to try Kippt and Diigo but the way they'd formatted the file wasn't friendly to either of these services, which would lump them all together instead of separate them by the categories we'd placed them in (although it would ""tag"" them with the category, but that doesn't help me navigate when my tags aren't listed out anywhere). When I complained about the descriptions issue on their Facebook page, they added them a few days later and another service (keeeb) tried to reach out and ask them how they could better serve the fallout (not sure if they responded, but keeeb looks like a neat service). I got in touch with Kippt to ask if they could figure out a way to get the imports to work correctly since they were being advertised, and they asked for my export file and said they'd work on it, but I haven't heard anything back.<p>I don't care if your service is free or not (and I even informed Snip.it I would have paid for the service, as some people replied on the linked post did as well), you owe it to the users that gave a shit about you and wanted to see you succeed to have some sort of grace period, and better, to escort them to similar services so they aren't left completely in the dust, having spent months and years of time contributing to and advertising for your company. At least in my situation, they tried to do the latter, even though these services weren't actually anything like their own and couldn't parse the data.<p>Whatever Yahoo! plans on doing with the Snip.it team, I won't be using it. I hope they're happy they've alienated a vibrant and growing audience.",1360259739

I believe right now my mid-grade Comcast connection is now primarily speed limited by my wireless router, rather than the Internet connection itself. This was not true when I signed up for it four years ago.

Many of us don't even dream about getting rich -- we just dream of having enough income to pay the bills.  Based on my experiences, and that of my peers, middle class life around the country is changing drastically.  I've watched a number of families formerly in the upper middle class fall into the mundane middle class, and middle class folks fall into the lower classes.

5183464,comment,5181742,5181831,8,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"People are way too hasty to label Aaron Swartz action as hacking, thieving or any word with illegal connotations. It is well known that Aaron by way of his associations with MIT had the right to download JSTOR articles there. All he did was to create a simple program that exploited his access with a program that went through the motions of downloading automatically instead of having to manually click on each articles. This is not hacking. It is a very common type of script used by software developers all the time. He already had legal access. He only accelerated the downloading of articles.<p>People have been attributing the fact that Aaron tried to hide his actions on the MIT campus as a sign that he knew what he was doing was illegal. I believe it is actually a sign of the opposite. All parties thought that the downloading he was doing was probably legal (or at least a gray area). However, it broke some Terms of Service agreement (you know the long documents you have to press 'accept' to when you want to install software). Everyone involved knew that, since they didn't have a good legal defense, the only thing the university could do to stop him using their network in a way that they didn't like was to physically stop him and kick him off campus as a trespasser. Therefore he had to hide from them to avoid this. It wasn't right for him to trespass and ignore Terms and Conditions but it certainly shouldn't have been a felony.<p>Why do I believe that Aaron thought what he was doing was legal? Aaron was not a naive person when it came to laws. Exhibit A: The amount of books Aaron read and reviewed, often more than 100 per year! If you look at the list there are lots of them on politics, economy,philosophy and law ( <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010</a> ).<p>Take a glance at Aaron's last blog post which is a review of a Batman movie. It is all about the strategic uses of game theory to affect the balance of powers in the legal and political system (<a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdk</a>). He seemed to have a very keen eye that saw all the weird ways laws and powers can flow in political systems.<p>It seems that Aaron was not trying to hack computer code but instead hack legal code. That is find legal means (or at least gray areas) that he could then exploit politically. Once he had the articles, he probably intended to release them publicly and confront the courts where he thought he could set favorable precedents for information freedom (like he had done in the past). He probably wanted to get caught for the act of releasing the articles but that required him not to get caught trespassing for a while.<p>Aaron's misjudgment was that he would face a legal challenge in broken but still somewhat reasonable copyright laws and maybe some kind of trespassing violation (and the civil disobedience would be on the level of trespassing) when instead he was confronted with completely disproportionate and unreasonable Anti-Hacking laws meant to deter terrorists from penetrating vital systems. These laws were way too broad by stating that anything that violates Terms and Condition (something that most people do) can be considered a felony. That is what is supposed to change with Aaron's law (<a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/02/aarons-law-amending-the-cfaa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/02/aarons-law-amending...</a>)<p>I think Aaron's misjudgment was a perfectly understandable. My opinion is that even MIT, in favoring prosecution, thought that he would face reasonable laws and would get a slap on the wrist. That is why they didn't tell the DOJ to drop the charges and are now internally investigating what happened.",1360259353

When the white section filled up, she was asked to move back some more and she refused. The police were called. They came and arrested her. She understood during this whole time that she would face prosecution and punishment, but she was doing what she believed was right. She fought the punishment in a very public way, and she became a symbol of the overall struggle through that.<p>Mr Swartz on the other hand was trying to be anonymous about his actions while he was doing them. Even though he was affiliated with Harvard and Harvard had access to JSTOR, but traveled to MIT specifically to use their network for this. He started taking the documents by WiFi, and when that was blocked, he found a closet in the basement to plug his laptop and external hard drive into. His program was designed to download the document slowly, to avoid being so obvious to be caught. He snuck in and out of MIT each day to swap hard drives, sometimes hiding his face from cameras. Much of what he did during this time was trying to avoid being caught. When caught, he gave back the data immediately and agreed never to release it. He was quiet about his legal struggle over the 2 years, not really pounding the drum to try to get attention to the injustice. Didn't blog about the case specifics, didn't do media interviews. Apparently he was trying to keep quiet about it not to upset the prosecutor. He was trying to convince prosecutors to drop the case entirely.<p>It's a subtle point perhaps, but Byrne is saying Swartz was not prepared for the consequences of his actions whereas other people fighting injustice usually are. After his arrest, he was not fighting publicly to rally support for what he did, but rather just trying everything he could to avoid prosecution.<p>I wonder if Swartz would have said he regretted the whole JSTOR incident before he died. Certainly Rosa Parks would not have regretted refusing to move seats, even if she landed in jail from it.",1360259087

Academics did, and publishers will wither away because they add no value and have relatively little power over the academics upon which they are parasites. I then break the law.<p>Certainly in computer science, it is not the publishers who have not built up brands people trust (except ACM and possibly IEEE). Academics forming program committees and organising the conferences have built up the trusted brands.<p>Now, in the past, it made sense to get a publisher to produce paper proceedings for attendees and distribute proceedings to libraries.<p>However, now publishers make very little contribution to conferences  attendees all pay a significant fee to attend. The programme committee and referees are not paid. The authors produce digital works (and the referees do minor proof reading, not the publisher). Paper copies are often not distributed. I've not been on a programme committee, but I'm pretty sure publishers are adding no value whatsoever.<p>The reason this hasn't withered away already is that all universities pay for access to all publishers so academics don't really see it as a problem; it's easier to just stick to the status quo when it's not your rights being violated.<p>But eventually, conference organisers will realise they can just tell Elsvier or Springer or even the IEEE and ACM to get stuffed. They'll then put the proceedings on arxiv or some other free place (hell, just torrent them) and merrily continue doing everything else exactly the same sans publisher.<p>Civil disobedience time: <a href=""http://robinmessage.com/wwv07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robinmessage.com/wwv07.pdf</a> is a conference paper I wrote. In order to participate in that conference, I was coerced into giving my copyright to Elsvier. Note they did nothing to make it happen; it was my work, and the work of the organising committee and referees. But I no longer own the copyright to that paper, and so probably broke the law posting it here.<p> Interestingly, apparently all publicly funded UK research will soon be required to be published somewhere open access, in direct violation of the requirements of most publishers. So academics have a fun question to answer: don't publish anywhere good, or break the law?",1360258698

Two things have happened here to make me see it:<p>- Taking on a role with more responsibility, leadership requirements and business knowledge<p>- Starting my own business where I get to make decisions (with my co-founder)<p>I see how many times as as developer I've either not cared about decisions that directly affect me. Or maybe I've just rolled over and accepted the things I don't like. It's the nature of (most) developers. Don't stir the pot. Don't dissent. Just get in and get my work done.<p>Here's the reality. Knowing more about your business makes you a better developer. Knowing how to say no and stand up for yourself makes you a better developer. Knowing how to talk and communicate with your users, your bosses, your co-workers (or anyone really), makes you a better developer (and will improve your work life). Being a strong technical person with strong Business, Marketing or Personal Communication skills makes you unstoppable. This applies to more than technical folk. The more you do - The better you are. Take this advice you might find that the skill you thought you were bad at, or hated, or avoided is actually very rewarding - Difficult, but rewarding.<p>And finally, to Amy: Thank you for all the work you do on showing people the power that they have. I started a business 5 years ago and have had to sit through the whole ""YOU NEED TO GET FUNDED"" and ""YOU NEED TO GET BOUGHT"" that seems so prevalent in the startup ecosystem. Me and my partner did everything ourselves. And now we own a business that makes decent money that goes DIRECTLY TO US.<p>But when you're overexposed to the opposite line of thinking, it's really easy to get caught up in the ""am I doing this wrong?"" and questioning yourself. You are one of the few people who puts an emphasis on growing and trusting YOURSELF. I'm very on board with most the things I hear you say because they are the very values that I have held in high esteem, yet was still questioning. So thank you for that.<p>ps.

IIRC they went from 30 billion to 4 billion in quite a short time and Apple was literally on the brink of bankruptcy (I believe Steve Jobs said in an interview that Apple had about a month left when the Microsoft deal came through).<p>I think it's fine for a company to have a nice amount of cash ready in case of some big setbacks. Especially since Apple seems willing to take huge gambles these days to enter new markets (iPod, iPhone, iPad and soon the Apple-designed TV I'm sure). And I think Apple needs these gambles to succeed, because eventually competitors will eat away profits at the lower ends of the ""older"" markets, slowly taking a bigger piece of the pie.<p>I don't think most stock holders are that much interested in the company or it's products but would rather make a quick buck. The interests are different. And spending money on stockholders would mean having less money to spend on the company. I don't see what Apple could gain, except perhaps some goodwill from stockholders.<p>I truly believe the Apple designed-TV will come either this year or next year and I also think this TV will revolutionise the market. I can imagine Siri being used instead of a remote control, for example (Steve Jobs had said he had gripes with the remote control). Once Apple enters this market, I think there's a very good chance Apple's stock prices will rise like crazy again. Stockholders will be able to sell the stock with huge gains.",1360258107

If you just look at the expenditures on production (Eg: buying the equipment used to make their products) it seems to have grown ~%33 in the past year.)<p>It could easily be the case that Apple spends %10-%20 of its cash <i>each year</i> on these efforts, as it needs to scale its business at double digit rates.<p>Having 10X your annual CapEx spending in the bank doesn't seem exactly irresponsible.  Quite the opposite.<p>You seem to be operating without a deep understanding of how the economics of companies and stocks work.

The other time was a domain that was owned by a Fortune 500 non-profit that a chinese buyer wanted. I was the go between. The non-profit didn't want to sell (buyer was willing to pay $50,000 nothing to sneeze at and the domain was not that valuable and well worth it to sell at that price). They buyer came to me because they had bought another domains from me and thought I could help them get this name. I still feel I had an angle to get the domain from them but the client didn't want to pay more money to try that angle. (Bonus points to anyone who can figure out that angle it's not a legal angle by the way.)<p>No matter what this seller tries to feign my belief is there is a weak point that would make him sell for way way less than 10,000,000 which of course is absurd for this domain. There aren't many buyers for this domain at even a $500k value. He may say he does not need the money but more than likely he is what I call the ""lottery ticket"" mentality where he is hoping that some big fish comes along and buys the domain for millions. While that <i>could</i> happen and he could be proven correct I don't think that <i>will</i> happen based on my 17 years of experience doing this.<p>The other thing is he is trying to hard to justify why he won't sell the domain and isn't interested. Shakespear comes to mind. As someone who owns plenty of domains I know exactly how many inquiries someone gets when they own a ""good"" short domain.  Guess what? You don't get that many inquiries to be annoyed when you own 1 or even 10 domains.<p>I could write a book on this obviously but the way to approach (a seller like this) is not to send an email but to dangle a formal offer in front of him with a deadline and see what he says then. Or I might get into a plane and fly out and try to casually meet him to determine what makes him tick or uncover some other info about him that will help me buy the domain (which could be 6 mos. later so the events aren't tied together).",1360257633

Companies incorporate under statutory frameworks that explicitly contemplate shareholder lawsuits in addition to other mechanisms for shareholders to assert their interests. Investors, in turn, buy stock with full knowledge of (and indeed, often because of) the fact that lawsuits are an option shareholders have to assert their rights.<p>In this case, you have to distinguish between ""I think Apple should be managed differently"" and ""hoarding cash amounts to a breach of fiduciary duty."" The former is about general corporate strategy, and that is governed by majority consent of the shareholders. The latter is a right specific to each shareholder, and so cannot be waived by majority consent.<p>Why is the process structured this way? For obvious reasons. Say you're buying a 25% stake in Apple, but back in the 1970's before it was Apple (remember, the rules of the arrangement as decided prospectively, before anyone knows how things will turn out, not retrospectively, after everyone knows the company will be a hit). You might be willing to leave general corporate strategy to a majority vote. However, if you think the company's actions actually amount to misuse of your capital investment, you want to be able to sue, not just submit your grievance to the majority vote.",1360257569

Of course none of those 3DP will market as ""print your own LEGO bricks"", but kids will figure this one quickly.<p>It will work a bit like a baking machine. Turn it on, leave it overnight and bunch of blocks roll out when you wake up in the morning. theLegoBrickBay.se will arise where kids will be able to download any STL file for any brick, LEGO set, minifig, etc, and LEGO with their tiny revenues (comparing to MAFIAA) will not be able to shut down the site.<p>Even if, arguendo, price of that printer will be $2,000 or more, its a cost of couple StarWars sets and any parent understanding the basics of financials will go with ""print your own"" instead of ""keep buying new sets"" thought.<p>Material will be cheap and reusable. After you are done with playing or simply dont need so many 1x4 bricks in grey color, you will put them all in a ""melter"" and within couple of hours all your grey bricks will become one solid cartridge ready to be used in printing new bricks, trees, horses, flowers, or whatever you want to.<p>You will see this coming in <> 5 years.

One is to sit quietly and wait for the animals you are interested in shooting to come by; the second is to try and sneak up on them (stalking); and the third is to go out and make noise to flush them out so you can shoot them.  This last method is what's used for things like rabbits, squirrels, and birds (although for different reasons -- rabbits and birds typically need to be flushed out from their hiding spots and squirrels will just freeze in place a lot of the time when they hear something, which makes them really easy to shoot).  Jefferson is probably referring to this type of hunting, which can often resemble a relaxing walk in the woods with one's dog.",1284974485

In some case, however, B is either a fundamental right, or is necessary to exercise that right.  Here, B is the right to privacy and free speech.<p>To exercise your right to free speech, the only reasonable way is to use the Internet.  And you need to run computer code to do that.  Similarly, to protect your privacy, the code you run (all of it) has to be trustworthy.  And I say that to be trustworthy, the code must be free, at least for you.  Conclusion: running free code (and only free code) is necessary to exercise some fundamental rights. Therefore, everyone deserve it.<p>The positive/negative freedom argument comes from the facts that (0) the four freedom are way more important than the freedom to proprietarize software, and (1) they conflict.  If you want to preserve the greater freedoms, you have to sacrifice the lesser one.  Now, people could be reasonable, and respect the four freedom even when they are allowed not to.

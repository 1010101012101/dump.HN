On one hand, you'll see hand-to-hand combat go on seemingly forever, with the combatants absorbing huge amounts of damage, yet continuing on without any apparent loss of stamina.<p>On the other hand, guns are depicted as instant killers. A single shot, even in an extremity or the belly, is immediately incapacitated and no longer a factor (except possibly at the end of the battle when we discover they've been playing dead). In reality, there's <i>nothing</i> that a single shot will do to <i>immediately</i> incapacitate someone, short of outright destruction of the CNS. Even a shot to the heart, femoral artery, etc., leaves at least several seconds of consciousness during which a determined attacker could get off another shot of his own. And according to my self defense firearms instructor, in a conflict it's likely that you won't even notice you're shot immediately, or at least not be aware of the severity.",1278510949

The odds of a (non-hypothermic) cardiac arrest patient being viable after an hour are slim to none.<p>However, the good news is that drownings are one of the few times where Hollywood-style CPR ""Do a couple rounds and they wake up"" can occur. Their heart stopped beating because it stopped getting oxygen, not due to some other type of damage. So if you do CPR for a little while and get their heart oxygenated again, it can start back up in its own (most pools nowadays have an AED as well)",1278510065

This is so as it is very easy to speak of a truth in one particular focused narration, which very much contradicts with other circumstances. The quote above being an example in point.<p>Why would anyone want to avoid pleasure, let alone be protected from it? I think watching telly for two hours can be pleasure, it is more difficult however to find out of when it becomes not self indulgment but not pleasure.<p>The riches of the world are useless entirely if they do not grant you access to pleasure. The entire point of existence is pleasure. Making money is pleasure, disciplining yourself to not waste time is done so as to gain more pleasure later than very little now, spending a lot of money is pleasure, as is making them, and of course the greatest pleasure of them all is sex so have plenty of it :P<p>My point Paul is that we do not need protection for pleasure. To the contrary, we need protection from non pleasure. It is however extremely hard firstly to identify what is pleasurable and secondly to acquire it. Investment for example can be pleasurable but only if you make a profit out of it and you feel comfortable with making the investment. That is, you can afford to loose what you invest and thus can only gain pleasure either way. When, however, large sums of money are invested, outside of that comfort zone, you are not protecting yourself from pleasure, you are instead denying yourself pleasure and giving in to its enemies, such as envy, irrational hope, lack of discipline, too much confidence in yourself or others while the alarm bell inside does ring so very softly that this might really not be right.<p>Thus perhaps, time and money should not be our currency, but pleasure.",1278509497

It's presents perhaps the highest form of risk in the payments industry. This is especially true with new businesses because there is no track record and typically very little financial stability or backing.  There is a graveyard in the payments industry dedicated to peer-to-peer payment startups, including some extremely well funded and connected companies, which is why it's so hard to find any payment provider willing to accept the risk. A lot of money has chased this for a long time now. Last time I checked, even Paypal won't allow provide payment services to other peer-to-peer providers, because, as they've stated, the ""excessive risk"". To date we've (Braintree) not approved any true peer to peer payment method as you described above, but we do process for a lot of merchants that use an aggregation model similar to Groupon, whereby the merchant accepts payment on behalf of another merchant. It's a small but significant difference.<p>In terms of revenue. It's always helpful if a business already has a track record and some external funding for validation as well as some stability.  That also clearly presents a catch-22. Some providers are wiling to take substantial risks: new business, peer-to-peer track record and no funding while others are only willing to consider this type of high risk businesses who have an established track record.<p>I would offer a friendly word of caution.  All too often new companies will find a provider to approve this type of business model only to be shut down at the worst possible time. This happens because sometimes the sales rep doesn't properly explain the business model to the underwriters, the underwriters don't understand it, and/or an application gets auto approval because it's new and has low expected volumes. I'm not suggesting that there are not providers that won't approve this type of business, and I'm also not suggesting that everyone approved for this type of payments model will eventually get shut down. What I am suggesting is that we see merchants getting shut down too frequently, so I'd be cautious if I were you.<p>Best of luck to you.<p>Aggregation more fully explained: <a href=""http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/blog/high-risk-mechant-account-third-party-payments-aggregation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/blog/high-risk-mech...</a>

Basically, without pre-orders, there would be no WakeMate. They were in the tough position of having to prove the product's viability to investors and the investors wanted actual credit cards to prove that viability. At the end of the day, it worked out as best as could be hoped for given such a bad launch estimate: roughly 90% of customers were never charged (PayPal being the exception, though the money remains PayPal's) and investors ponied up enough cash to hire the necessary people and pay for everything going into the first big run, which all together will end up costing waaaay more than what those $5 could have bought.<p>Don't get me wrong, it's still embarrassing to everybody that we've had pre-orders waiting for so long; that was never the intention. It's a shitty way to treat our first customers, but it was an honest mistake.

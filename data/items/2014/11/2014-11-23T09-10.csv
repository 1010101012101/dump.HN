8648308,comment,8646787,8647242,0,0,throwaway_yy2Di,,,"Actually, the majority of the weight would be in steel rope.<p>For one type [0], the safe limit is a tensile load of about 134-150 MN/m^2 (= MPa) [1]. At a density of 8 g/cm^3, the limiting length of a uniform cable is ~1.7 - 1.9 kilometers. If you have a stationary, suspended cable of this length, its own weight puts it at its maximum load; it can&#x27;t lift anything else.<p>Steel rope on McMaster is around $10,000/ton [of rope]. So, these assumptions are a dead end.<p>You can&#x27;t solve this by using shorter cables, because that decreases your energy capacity at the same rate. If you use cables of 1/10th the length (~100 m), you get only 1/10th the potential energy storage per ton. The cable thickness per lifted ton is constant.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wire-rope-strength-d_1518.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wire-rope-strength-d_1518....</a><p>[1] The <i>breaking</i> limit of rope is far higher (~700 MPa), and the breaking limit of a single wire strand -- the tensile strength -- is higher still (1,770 MPa according to [2])<p>For the cross section area, I&#x27;m assuming a circular rope (not accurate).<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gabaswire.com/en/overview/grades-of-wire-rope.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabaswire.com/en/overview/grades-of-wire-rope.htm...</a>",1416736717

There are a lot of &quot;obvious ideas&quot; that have only come to fruition recently where the technology was already basically proven, but only entered productive use after several generations of systemic improvements made it a competitive choice. For example: LED lighting was around for several decades but only had niche application until gradual cost/quality improvements pushed it ahead of older lighting tech - and now every major city is rushing to replace all their old street lights. With the Gravitricity tech there are factors like the cost of drilling, the strength, cost and density of the materials used, and lifetime maintenance costs relative to other solutions. There&#x27;s lots of room for expertise to know for sure what the issues and bottlenecks are.<p>I&#x27;m looking through all the dismissive comments to see if any of them are pinpointing it as a scam - because this is, after all, the kind of idea that is simple enough to captivate laypeople and lift dollars out of their pockets. But judging from this kind of response, it seems like it&#x27;s also the kind of idea that is simple enough to be dismissed as a &quot;they would have done it already if it worked,&quot; rationalized via fuzzy back-of-the-envelope math.<p>Ultimately, since I have no stake in this one, I&#x27;ll just wish them luck.",1416735381

In first aid, one would not put a finger in the wound. I would like to clear this up for laypersons:<p>It&#x27;s either direct pressure on the wound, if possible with some padding, like this: <a href=""http://www.roteskreuz.at/typo3temp/pics/17_EH_Blutung-Arm_3923b750bb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roteskreuz.at/typo3temp/pics/17_EH_Blutung-Arm_39...</a>
If you don&#x27;t have gloves, or while putting them on, have the patient do it - with a wound of this size, this usually works well.<p>If the wound is too big, apply direct pressure on the artery between the heart and the wound, like this: <a href=""http://www.citizencorps.fema.gov/cert/IS317/medops/images/ic_04_02_0130.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citizencorps.fema.gov/cert/IS317/medops/images/ic...</a><p>Apply just as much pressure as needed to stop the bleeding, use your fist if your fingers are not strong enough. Wait for the ambulance to apply a more permanent solution.",1416733249

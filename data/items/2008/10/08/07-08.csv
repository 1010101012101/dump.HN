And in countries like Egypt have low economic growth and huge inflation in marriage prices, so males have to work long and hard into their 30es to get married. And they can't just get a girlfriend and marry her in a inexpensive ceremony with only a civil unions - the religious leaders made sure its illegal (they have a interest in preserving the expensive traditions, you see).<p>Most men in the Middle East can hardly afford a single wife. Only really, really rich men have harems.<p>Of course the reasons are way more complex.<p>I'll recommend this excellent article from Fareed Zakaria:\nThe Politics of Rage: Why Do They Hate Us?\n <a href=""http://fareedzakaria.com/articles/newsweek/101501_why.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fareedzakaria.com/articles/newsweek/101501_why.html</a>",1223450768

If 100 people want to try to create an entrepreneur network and see if they can get a real user base going then that's fine. I doubt many users find networks to join by browsing through them on ning.com anyway, but instead probably come across them from elsewhere online.

As a freelancer, I find that often I need to steer clear of ""better"" (though perhaps technically complex) solutions at times because I know it may create a panic when I leave. It's frustrating to ""play to the crowd"" but I have also found it can be just as bad to leave companies with elements their in-house employees can't figure out.",1223449468

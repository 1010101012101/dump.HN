For many people, to find your global optimum you have to first traverse several local minima.<p>In this thread there are going to be stories about people who worked a Normal Job (TM) for years and started a successful business with the savings, stories about people who bootstrapped a startup before puberty and kept it small, stories about people countering the other people with <i>their</i> amazing story, and stories following all kinds of patterns.  And unless you&#x27;re extremely fortunate, all of these stories have one thing in common:  they are most likely nothing like your life and ultimately you won&#x27;t be able to completely integrate them into <i>your</i> life story.  Otherwise you&#x27;d be the one writing the story and not asking the questions ;)<p>While you can, and should, learn from others, at the end of the day you really do have to find your own reason to do the more difficult thing each day.

7622535,comment,7621747,7621747,1,0,demallien,,,"Heh.  The one and only time that I ever wrote a parser in my professional career was for a build tool.  In my defence, at the time I didn&#x27;t know much about command line tools, and had only really programmed in IDEs.  So when the new project was to be compiled on the command line, I quickly discovered that maintaining dependencies, changing targets and doing all the other things that a build system generally does by hand quickly gets old.  Not knowing that autotools, cmake, ant, and about a bajillion other tools already existed to do just this, I wrote my own language, with a parser in ruby, no less :D<p>I have since repented.  I find autotools (with occasionally a script of [ruby|python|perl] to handle something that would otherwise be tricky to do in make or m4, which is then called by the makefile) works a treat. Just don&#x27;t try to do anything tricky in the auto tool files - as I said, boot anything exotic out to a separate tool.<p>Also, any discussion of build tools without also discussing package management is but half a discussion.",1398103135

That show is a typical paint-by-numbers sitcom, the kind that CBS has been cashing big checks on for the past decade. They aren&#x27;t particularly funny. I think Chuck Klosterman wrote something that these shows are &quot;in the form of funny&quot;, which means that they follow a common comedic timing and use the laugh track as a cue. Once you start looking for it, you always see it.<p>The three camera and laugh track are usually indicators that the show probably isn&#x27;t &quot;smart funny&quot;, but it&#x27;s not always true. I can watch Seinfeld reruns and pick out the camera cuts, laugh tracks and joke timings, but the show is still pretty clever.<p>But most people capable of making shows of Seinfeld-quality aren&#x27;t going to go do a CBS sitcom. Seinfeld&#x27;s set up was mostly a relic of its era. Today, you can get a single-camera comedy greenlit thanks to the cable channels. Even networks took some chances. I don&#x27;t watch too many network shows anymore, but I know Scrubs and Arrested Development were single camera shows without laugh tracks and they were on NBC/ABC and Fox, respectively.<p>As for Silicon Valley, I was expecting more from it. It&#x27;s a Mike Judge show and the reviews were very positive. I&#x27;ve only seen the first two episodes, but they were at least good enough to make me want to watch more. It sometimes takes these shows a while to build the characters and build enough background for more jokes to connect, but at this point, I&#x27;m more worried about the story lines being thin than the comedy. That&#x27;s what ultimately lost my interest in Entourage. That show started out as being a fun 30 minutes, but it was very superficial and once you realized that the plots were ridiculous and the characters didn&#x27;t make that much sense, it became tedious to watch. Since both Entourage and Silicon Valley are both based on specific, unique cultures, I think they&#x27;re fairly comparable.",1398102407

We can observe the universe. We can&#x27;t create any meaningful controls when we do so, but we can use the observed data to construct models. If those models fit our observations, then they are accepted. If we find a situation in which the model does not correctly describe a system (i.e. it has been falsified), then we can modify it, or discard it entirely.<p>One can adopt entirely the same process to research the effects of lead. We can observe that, based on available data, a certain phenomenon occurred. We can use other sources of information to compensate for other possible causes. If there is information available which contradicts that conclusion, then we can discard the model. Like other scientific disciplines, there is never 100% certainty about the validity of a model, however if adequate contradicting evidence can be shown, then it will be shown invalid.<p>The &quot;black swan&quot; is a simplistic view of falsifiability.

First you have to deal with whatever router configuration / NAT is present. And sometimes your friend&#x27;s IP changes, and you&#x27;re stuck setting up dynamic DNS or a reverse proxy.<p>The Broadway box was generally panned in reviews for not including a workaround for these networking issues, and I suspect the technical complexity of friend-to-friend streaming is why TV broadcasters have never been worried about it in the past.

The only way to get around these obstacles would be to feed one group of people doses of lead and compare them to another in a controlled setting, or isolate two groups of people, give one group the right to birth control and abortions, deny the other group those rights, and keep them from finding out about each other.<p>Uh, no, statistical controls are a real tool of real science.

In my imaginary language, the declaration implicitly tells the computer to store the value as a float, because the kilogram type has been defined as such elsewhere. But that&#x27;s not all it does! It tells us and the compiler that this float <i>represents a real-world quantity measured in kilograms.</i> It prevents us from mistakenly passing kilograms where a pounds were expected, or seconds where kilograms were expected.<p>On the Haskell front, you might be interested in the Dimensional library, which does just that.

It simply measures running js time for initial rendering, which is the ugly, unavoidable cost of frameworks that authors don&#x27;t like to talk about.

TL;DR: The main differences is that Mithril is a lightweight MVC, whereas React is a powerhouse at doing only the &quot;V&quot; part.<p>There&#x27;s actually a project that uses React to enable HTML-y Mithril templates here ( <a href=""https://github.com/insin/msx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/insin/msx</a> ), so the two can certainly coexist.<p>Mithril&#x27;s light weight is mostly a result of picking a very small set of tools that are simple but useful on their own, but that also happen to come together nicely and that can play ball w/ Javascript&#x27;s FP capabilities and the JS ecosystem as a whole.<p>Mithril is also a bit of a experiment in making a framework that gets out of your way - more hacking and less figuring out what is the syntax to do X.

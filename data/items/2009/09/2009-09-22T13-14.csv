I've long ceased being a vocal advocate of pair programming, but when done well, you're having an ongoing dialogue with your pair partner. If the code isn't amenable to working that way, or if you or your partner aren't amenable to working that way (i.e., thinking out loud almost constantly), then it's probably a poor choice for you and your group.<p>In a healthy environment, I prefer pairing, for most of the same reasons that are described in the NYT article.

Only an atrocious pair would say something like ""Oh... yes, that function... I already thought of that, and here's why it can't work."". When pairing, thinking is talking. If the one not typing at the moment is allowed to get bored, then the pairing is not done correctly.<p>Also, in my experience, two developers working as a pair will have better work ethics and discipline than any of the two taken separately.<p>BTW, you're calling the one not typing the 'passive' one?

It describes a fairly simple, but non-trivial task (creating an RSS feed from your email inbox, generating the RSS feed, and directly interacting with the POP3 protocol over SSL)<p>Also, most of the code will require slight modification to work with the most recent version of Erlang. This seems like a bad thing, but it forces you to actually understand the code and determine what broke, rather than just copy-and-pasting everything.. For example, the regexp module had changed name, so I prodded around the erlang library code to see where it went, and if the arguments had changed - in doing so I realised how simple (most of) the code was, something I wouldn't have done if the tutorial was ""better""..",1253627449

I love the idea of 'walking a mile in our shoes' to better understand what it means to be a developer, but to suggest that a non-techie should learn to program, and that it could take 2 or 10 years, is the best way to guaruntee that not only is that dream never realized, but the whole world has passed them by in those 10 years and they've lost multiple opportunities that they could have capitalized on because they were so focused on learning how to program.<p>Instead, build your network, and that goes for us developers as well.

I've spoken with a lot of ""entrepreneurial"" developers and many of them just don't have what it takes, particularly on the consumer side, to complete the loop and take a product to market successfully. That's not to say they aren't amazing developers.<p>I'm a big advocate of teams, ~3 seems to be a good mix to move quickly and thoroughly at the start. Developer, UX/Designer, Business/Marketer. The 3rd you can do without if the first two are competent enough, business and marketing isn't that difficult (especially with a great product) unless your revenue is reliant on software sales/licensing. Then having a deal-guy is pretty good if he has a big rolodex, reputation, legal understanding to protect the company, and of course – is a closer.<p>The reason I feel designers are pretty important now is that the web has matured and consumers generally have an elevated expectation compared to the early 00's. Most matured web apps are pretty damn impressive and I think it would be a mistake to assume a developer can handle both the backend and frontend.",1253626833

What R Hickey is addressing is modeling.<p>I think the modeling problem could be alternatively addressed by unlearning the notion (conceit?) that every program is a representation/simulation (which is where (domain) state creeps in) and instead embrace a descriptive/measurement approach.  Or more precisely, to accept that a program is always orthogonal to the domain model and give up chasing after the holy grail/folly of seeking a paradigm to express ""reality"" in computer instructions.<p>One could argue that this is what FP is all about, but suggestion here is that the issue is fundamentally the conceptual view of the programmer and it can apply equally to OO or any other paradigm of programming.<p>For example, the ""Date"" case he outlines conceptually works if one is to suspend disbelief and accept the notion that a ""Date"" type object is really a point in time.  ""How can September 22, 2009 change?""  But at some level this is just semantics.  Would calling the ""Date"" object ""DateDatum"" cause a similar conceptual problem?<p>DateDatum lastUpdate = now ();

That seems to indicate that ""we"" are all idiots, or masochists.<p>I found the analogy to garbage collection just right.  It's obvious now that for large parts of the problem space of writing computer programs, having garbage collection built into the language makes programs significantly easier to write and understand.  Joel Spolsky made the argument that object oriented programming didn't do nearly as much to make programming more productive as automated memory management did, and I agree.<p>So why not take this other problem that is very hard to reason about, and build constructs into the language that take care of it for you automatically?  I think the fact this seems so obvious to you that it's hardly worth saying points to how powerful the argument is.  If it's so obvious, why is almost everyone still programming with mutable state and with so little support for ""time management"" constructs?  Isn't this the same thing as stubbornly clinging to free and malloc in programs where garbage collection would work just fine?",1253625674

None of the physical reasons the author brought up applied: it was in a decent, private room, with decent hardware. The social problems did not apply: it was with cool, friendly people.<p>It turns out that, in pair programming, while the active person hacks with all his neurons firing, the passive one sits bored out of his mind. I found that passively following someone else's programming, and possibly even fixing minor mistakes, barely uses up a fraction of the mental energy of actively coding. The passive ends up being a distraction. When the passive makes a comment (""have you considered changing this function to do XYZ?""), the active looks up, completely distracted and torn from his concentration, and stares at the passive. ""What?.. What did you say?.. Oh... yes, that function... I already thought of that, and here's why it can't work."" Basically, I found that being passive in a programming pair also blocks the kind of forward-thinking analysis which leads to good programs.<p>One more thing. The author claims that pair programming helps avoid duct-taping problems. I completely disagree, at least when it comes to my own work. When I look at my code, and I see the beginnings of something bad, I ask myself: ""Could someone else understand this in two months? Will I, when it breaks?"" Then I go back and fix it. Whereas in pair programming, two people will likely look at each other and say, ""Oh yeah, that's an obvious workaround! Let's keep going!""",1253625095

You aren't going to hook people with an address and a promise to offer ""strategic solutions"" (a phrases that as far as I can tell means nothing to anyone). I don't care who your business contacts are. I don't care what your ""third industry"" is. I definitely need more than one big ad to get me to choose you. I think if you take just 5 minutes to look through 37 Signals home page, you will see how it is at least 100 times better than what any profile on there could be.<p>Above the fold of 37 Signals home page, I learn that they develop web apps, that they offer 4 main products, and what those products do. If I scroll down a page, I hear their pitch of their best strengths, see that I have access to video customer testimonials (awesome!) and learn that they have two regularly updated blogs (awesome, that means they didn't just throw up a website and leave it there hoping something would come from it). I also learn that they have a book and some more smaller apps. At the bottom of the page, I learn some cool stuff not directly related to their business. They developed Ruby on Rails, they have an affiliate program, etc. I also see that people care about their business and are talking about it.<p>If I compare a Prospect Vista profile... I see an update at the top, pushing down the main content of the page to give me information I don't care about. I see a quick profile with nothing that I care about in it. I see a list of contacts that I don't care about. In the middle, I see a big banner ad that I may or may not care about depending on how talented the person who made it was. I see comments and a discussion board, both of which are likely to be quiet and therefore not worth caring about. Finally, I see a huge amount of contact information which I have no reason to care about because nothing has hooked me.<p>I don't mean to be harsh.

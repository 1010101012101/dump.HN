8591476,comment,8590347,8590347,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"This reminds me of Belousov–Zhabotinsky reactions, which can be modeled by cellular automata, or realized by chemical reactions, slime molds, and coral reefs. (Of course, after staring at them for as many hours as I have, everything reminds me of Belousov–Zhabotinsky reactions! ;)<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_r...</a><p>The essence of a cellular automata rule that exhibits BZ reactions is:<p>There are two forces at work playing off against each other: stimulation and inhibition. Stimulation is implemented by observing your local surrounding neighbors. Inhibition is implemented by a delay. The result is beautiful spiraling oscillations!<p>A cell can be stimulated or quiescent (one bit). And it has a timer to remember how long ago it was stimulated (typically another bit). When it&#x27;s quiescent, and the stimulation condition is true, it becomes stimulated, and sets the timer. In subsequent steps, it finishes being stimulated, then the timer expires, and it can&#x27;t be stimulated again until the timer expires.<p>The stimulation condition is usually a counting rule, like Life: it sums the number of stimulated neighbors, and then uses that to index into a look-up table to decide its next state.<p>The effect is that waves of stimulation spread out throughout the medium, and the wave&#x27;s leading edge propagates into areas that are not stimulated, until it hits another wave, and they cancel each other out or reflect waves in other directions.<p>The trailing edge of the wave is caused by the inhibition, and consists of cells that have just been stimulated and won&#x27;t be stimulated again immediately -- that way the wave spreads in one direction instead of all directions at once.<p>By changing the stimulation condition, you can generate different shapes of waves, which usually develop into interlocking spirals forming around stable nucleation patterns.<p>One metaphor for how this rule works is to the worm-like animals in a coral reef, who come out of their shells to feed, then pull back inside their shells when tickled by adjacent worms pulling back, only to come back out after a short time. That&#x27;s why this particular CA rule is called &quot;WORMS&quot; (in Toffoli and Margolus&#x27;s &quot;Cellular Automata Machines&quot; book).<p>Here&#x27;s some JavaScript code that implements three kind of worms, with three different kinds of stimulus conditions (alarms), which I call &quot;Yuppy Worms&quot;, &quot;Hipster Worms&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Worms&quot;:<p><a href=""https://github.com/SimHacker/CAM6/blob/master/javascript/CAM6.js#L5293"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SimHacker/CAM6/blob/master/javascript/CAM...</a><p>The &quot;Yuppy Worms&quot; are all uptight, geometrical and diagonal. The &quot;Hipster Worms&quot; are more relaxed and rounded. And the &quot;Bohemian Worms&quot; are all rough and fuzzy and organic.<p><pre><code>        // The personality is a key into the dict of alarm arrays,\n        // which are indexed by the count of excited neighbors,\n        // and contain 1 if the cell should be excited or 0 if\n        // not.\n        var alarms = {\n\n            // This results in spirals with tight straight diagonal diamonds.\n            yuppie:   [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n\n            // This results in spirals with loose smooth rounded diamonds.\n            hipster:  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n\n            // This results in spirals with looser rustic fuzzy spirals.\n            // That is due to the anneal-like discontinuity in the alarm table.\n            bohemian: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n        }[personality];\n</code></pre>\nThe Yuppie and Hipster look-up tables vote with the majority (for different definitions of majority), while the &quot;anneal-like discontinuity&quot; in the Bohemian alarm table is kind of like a non-conformist tie-breaker voting the other way when the vote is almost even (which is the essence of the &quot;anneal&quot; CA rule). That causes turbulence and roughness, so it looks much more organic than geometric.",1415731954

8591453,comment,8589674,8589674,0,0,Johnie,,,"A confluence of events that are coming to head in the last year and coming year is creating significant opportunities in the retail point of sale space. The retail technology stack has become pretty stale in the last 10 years. What you see at many retailers is decade old technology. The existing legacy players have carved out their domain and have fought hard to fight off any change.<p>All this is changing due to a number of events that are coming to head now.<p>* EMV liability shift in October 2015 is forcing merchants to upgrade their payment terminals. When merchants are upgrading, they all want to future proof their investment. So, they are all looking at the latest and greatest technology. The new Verifone and Ingenico terminals are filled with every type of technology that they can think of. This includes wifi, BLE, high res lcd screens, etc. In addition, both Verifone and Ingenico have opened up APIs for third parties to write apps for these terminals outside of the secure PCI sandbox. Then you have newcomers like Poynt that is trying to disrupt this entire space.<p>* Windows XP deprecation: many of the existing pos, like micros and Aloha, run on top of Windows XP. With the Windows XP deprecation, retailers are required to upgrade their pos to maintain PCI compliance. Instead of spending thousands on upgrading to the latest Micros and Aloha POS, they are now looking at tablet based and cloud based pos systems. This allows companies like Revel, Square, and Clover to move into the space of existing legacy players.<p>The largest challenge for these newcomers (that many underestimate) is the depth of software in the aloha/Micros pos. These pos not only handle order management and payment, but they also run the entire store operation (ie inventory, payroll, scheduling, etc). For a newcomer to come in, it&#x27;s very high cost to replace all of these functionalities. At Money2020, one of the speakers stated &quot;Changing a Pos is equivalent to changing the way they run the business&quot;<p>* POS as a platform. Micros and Aloha treated their platform as an ecosystem that they wanted to protect. They make it very difficult for third parties to innovate on it. For example, to get access to the Micros SDK, it requires a $25k license plus $1k per deployment. This is a great barrier to entry for startups. The new players have all created open ecosystems to enable third parties to write apps on them. Verifone, Ingenico, Poynt, and Clover have all gone as far as to create an app store to enable third parties to sell and distribute their app.<p>Where we are at now in the pos space is where we were then in the mobile space when the iPhone first came out. There are lots of opportunities to innovate in this space. Lots of developers and startups are waiting at the gate for the entire retail technology stack to refresh to get into this space.<p>Definitely very exciting times.",1415731709

You only plot a point if it&#x27;s a prime, but it&#x27;s still always going to trace a spiral!<p>Still, this only-plotting-primes business leads to new, unexpected patterns emerging. Yet, if you think about it, that&#x27;s not altogether surprising really. Patterns emerge not so much in where the primes are, as where the primes aren&#x27;t. Once you go beyond two, anything divisible by two can&#x27;t be a prime anymore. Same with three. Same for all numbers, because that&#x27;s what prime means. As a result, you get a pattern. It just so happens that this is what that pattern looks like when you plot it on a spiral rather than a straight line, or in a grid like the OP.<p>The grid has a similar effect, but the pattern forms vertical lines depending on how many of the prime factors within the set divide evenly by the modulo divisor chosen. Or the divisor +/- 1, which gives rise to diagonals (try adjusting the number up/down by 1 to see this effect).",1415731529

Though it took a lot of time and effort, I managed to get both the approval and funds needed for a small scale - 10 user - install (on my 3rd try, gov&#x27;t is really against change).<p>Our current &quot;enterprise&quot; VCS is PVCS (so old I had to look it up). The idea was to get github installed on a small scale, gain support and extend it to the entire agency over the course of a couple years. Everyone who deals with PVCS wants git, but the management don&#x27;t care to put in the effort to get it initially, so gaining the support would be easy.<p>A couple months ago, the entire thing collapsed on my face and we went with gitlab instead. Why? Because github&#x27;s sales team f*ed it up. Apparently, the $5k minimum order was too small for them to care (at least that&#x27;s what my side says). Too bad, I really wanted to get them in the door.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a bad egg in the sales, but seriously there are some people trying to fix/modernize gov&#x27;t tech from the inside and thing&#x27;s like this don&#x27;t help. I guess my only recommendation is that if your company usually sells to private and the gov&#x27;t asks for a small-sized purchase please be flexible. The guy who caused this request to happen has likely been putting in a huge amount of effort and has larger plans for integrating your service over time. The person who is contacting you is not that guy, has no idea what your product (or any tech) is/why it matters and is usually doing the originator a favor.",1415730635

The charged particles in the flare are following magnetic field lines, which run (typically) from one point on the Sun&#x27;s surface, up through its atmosphere, and then back down to another point.  The diagram you linked illustrates this very well.<p>There is one other wrinkle, which is that the video shows only a relatively narrow frequency range of light.  The full list is at  <a href=""http://aia.lmsal.com/public/instrument.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aia.lmsal.com/public/instrument.htm</a> ; the video was made from just one frequency band from that list.<p>Each band is sensitive to plasma within one particular temperature range.  So, as plasma heats or cools, it can disappear from the image even though it is still there.<p>By combining the information from the various temperature ranges (i.e., various frequency ranges) you can reconstruct heating/cooling of packets of plasma as they travel through the solar atmosphere.  The ranges were chosen to sample about equally in log(temperature) -- rightmost column of the list above.<p>The reason this is so important is that the temperature of the atmosphere increases dramatically as you go up, and we don&#x27;t understand why.  This is the &quot;coronal heating problem&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona#Coronal_heating_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona#Coronal_heating_problem</a>).<p>If you look at the video, you could get the impression that the pictures are just giving a visual impression of where flaring is happening.  In fact, because of the sampling process described above, they are used in a quantitative way to initialize 3D magneto-hydrodynamic models so that the flows can be modeled and predicted.

Obviously, this requires you placing trust in TradeMore, but we will work hard to win this trust. One option is to start lending a small amount through us so that you can see what using our service is like. Full disclosure: we do not return lender funds in certain &#x27;force majeure&#x27; events, such as a number of exchanges being undermined or entering bankruptcy. Hence, your funds are more secure in your own wallet or, even better, within cold storage. But if you are interested in earning a modest return on your holdings you might want to give us a try.",1415730037

Everything else was perfect except for that VitD level. I was shocked, but after reading up on Vitamin D it made sense: I&#x27;ve had maybe two tans in 15 years, I don&#x27;t get anywhere near enough sun exposure, and diet hardly makes a dent in the amount of VitD it takes to bring your blood levels up to a 40 or 50 range.

That&#x27;s theoretically possible, but it&#x27;s incredibly unlikely if you believe that the probability estimates provided by the probabilistic tests are correct, since you could set the probability to be below 1/2⁵⁰⁰ or whatever.  The idea is that it&#x27;s reasonable to use things that are merely probably correct if you can set the probability that they&#x27;re wrong to be well below the probability that something else in the system has already failed in a worse way (such as a cosmic ray causing a bit flip in the private key parameters that caused them to be composite).<p>So to summarize, we can already find large primes very quickly (and quickly enough to generate the crpyto keys we want), we&#x27;re just not sure that those primes are prime, but we&#x27;re sure <i>enough</i> to use them!<p>Now there is also the EFF Cooperative Computing Awards (which I run), where if you can find and prove <i>really</i> large primes, like world-record size, you can win cash prizes.<p><a href=""https://www.eff.org/awards/coop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/awards/coop</a><p>There is a reference in <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i> that may be intended to allude to this and seems to be based on the idea that these large primes would be useful for cryptography.

Whereas our prize does require that you publish your primes first...)<p>A lot of people who contact us are a bit confused about the relative sizes of the primes involved.

Of course, primes this big are found with special techniques that are only applicable to numbers of special forms.

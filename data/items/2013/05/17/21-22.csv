They potentially have access to an incredible amount of data including the exact amount of time a user takes to engage with a lesson, how fast he or she is typing / is able to complete tasks, even the varying levels of difficulty at which different concepts are being learning, etc. This is all stuff that none of the current online education platforms have even tried to do anything with yet.<p>But to say that an online education platform will never be as good as a teacher in a classroom is like going back to 60s and saying that computer image recognition sucks so we might as well stop trying.",1368827603

Sorry for being confusing.<p>>Anyway, when you accelerate a car, you are not feeling acceleration, you are feeling the force of the car on you.<p>According to [Force = Mass * Acceleration] you can take them as equal (apart from the constant factor of your mass). In the freefalling box that is accelerating (and thus no longer in free fall) you'd also feel a force. No need for experiments if you have your normal senses. You'll be pressed against one side of the box. (And if the acceleration is 9.81 m/s^2 you couldn't distinguish it from a box on earth.)<p>That is actually the basic premise of general relativity - the equality of 'inertial mass' that resists against acceleration and 'gravitational mass' that happens because of, well, gravity. \nIt's like the idea of constant speed of light for special relativity.<p>edit:\nUnless you're talking about gravity, which accelerates all parts of the setup equally, thus no force results.. but that would need something else in the experiment, either a great amount of matter or energy. But then you'd have a reference frame right there. (Mathematically. As for an experiment.. hm. Check for perturbances from space-time distortions that result from rotating gravity sources, maybe.. most gravity sources in this universe are rotating. There's an experiment done that checked that for Earth.[1])<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B</a>",1368825572

So I'll re-examine the simple while loop like oneeyedpigeon posted:<p><pre><code>  while (*t++ = *f++)\n      ;\n</code></pre>\nThis code really packs a lot of punch. The value of f is copied to t and then both pointers are incremented. If the value is 0 the loop is terminated. So there's always at least one character copied.<p>In my initial rash response the loop would exit without copying the 0. So to fix it I might just add a new line<p><pre><code>  *to = 0;\n</code></pre>\n(if I'm not mistaken the pointer is already incremented when the loop exits).<p>Another option would be a while loop with a break statement, It looks weird, but does express the correct intent, which is ""continuously copy from source string and exit if you've reached the end"":<p><pre><code>  while (true) {\n\n    *to = *from;\n    if (*to == 0) break;\n\n    from++\n    to++;\n\n  }</code></pre>",1368825468

For example when and when not to align notes, etc.<p>The OP does seem to favour a table-like grid layout for source code, yet I rather feel like source code describes hierarchical trees (that is why we like the indenting). Arranging things in a tabular way is not principally beneficial. Sometimes you encounter things like this:<p><pre><code>    int                x =       get_width();\n    const long double  y = 1.5 * get_width();\n</code></pre>\nBut what use is the aligning? Type, identifier and value of `x` are far apart, it is easy to switch lines here.<p>Now most programming languages have a big problem with indentation and layout because their syntax is weird. C's habit of putting types in front, etc. That is probably why the GNU C styleguide is proposing something like this:<p><pre><code>    int\n    strcpy( ....\n</code></pre>\nType and identifier on separate lines.

Having a personal tutor that helps you with your homework and example problems is much further into the future. But my biggest problem in school was not that I didn't get help to solve problems and do homework, it's that the teachers often didn't explain high-level concepts in a way that made it click for me. It's the one-to-many teaching that is especially bad today if you get a teacher that either can't explain well, or just doesn't understand the subject deeply enough to explain it well.<p>Edit: As an example, listen to Feynman talk about anything and everything, and compare that with your average or below average college lecturer. The difference in your understanding is immense. A good teacher helps you build a mental model of the world and gets you excited about it. A bad teacher just regurgitates what the course material says with no real engagement. I wish I could have had Feynman-level lectures on everything from the start, it would have saved me years.",1368824457

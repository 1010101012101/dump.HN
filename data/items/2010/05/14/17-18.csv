It also makes it diffcult to maintain code within a team of programmers using Scala unless they come to some agreement on style.<p>On a side note - Scala is not my fav.

There will be a lot of ups and downs, so just remember to enjoy the good times and hang in there and be persistent through the bad.<p>I have a couple suggestions for your landing page:<p>* The current overall payload is 382.1K. You could significantly reduce this and speed up the load time if you enable gzip compression on your web server. Seems like you're running this on IIS 6.0--there is a configuration option for HTTP compression buried somewhere in the submenus, I believe.<p>* The rounded corners have a white background, whereas the page background at the top is gray. This causes the top corners to have a very visible rectangular edge. The IE-6 friendly way to fix this is to change the background color for the top corners to match the background color of the top of the page. If you don't care about IE 6, you can simply give them transparent backgrounds.<p>Good luck!",1273858468

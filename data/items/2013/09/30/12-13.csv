If you&#x27;ve always been one, if you want to do things, but can never do it, it could be a sign.<p>ADHD is a real problem, and has real solutions (and those solutions aren&#x27;t all addictive).<p>If you feel like you are always running behind, always trying to catch up.  If anyone says you are a great developer, but that you&#x27;re always playing catch up, get checked.  It can help change your life for the positive.",1380545972

From riding myself I remember many times when a ride went a bit further, or a bit wider than expected and one of the group would need to top up, so there would need to be a lot to make this viable and relaxing.<p>For commutes, it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s almost like it should be a sporty tourer, but then that&#x27;s no fun on a press release.<p>I think given the Formula E plan of having 2x cars per race, racing is actually more applicable. Racing will challenge how these bikes are recharged/replaced quickly.<p>The most often overlooked issue with press-release-bikes, is that many motorcycle owners will show terror at the thought of having a no-brand bike. The cost of parts, servicing, or replacement if it gets crashed (it will) is so high, that it really is only a toy for the naive or rich (or both).",1380545907

Designing a hardware true random number generator takes a lot of effort that this design is evidently lacking. For example, there is no whitening whatsoever. Even worse, the firmware includes a line of code that ensures that the &quot;RNG&quot; never outputs the same &quot;random&quot; number twice in a row.<p>Also, usually HW RNGs include a firmware module that is constantly monitoring the entropy output and shutting off the generator in case of it sinking below a certain threshold to detect hardware failure and prevent it from causing predictable output.<p>Some more information on this subject can be found at Wikipedia: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator#Performance_test"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generat...</a>\nI do not want to discourage anybody from working on such things.

South Africa is a resource-rich country with good ports. How come economics doesn&#x27;t &quot;favor industry controlled by&quot; South Africa, while it will favor Mars that way?<p>Kenneth Burke gives an example of gradatio, a rhetorical technique: &quot;Who controls Berlin, controls Germany; who controls Germany controls Europe; who controls Europe controls the world&quot;. That construct is well-enough known that a Google search for &quot;who controls * controls the world&quot; finds dozens of different examples in the first few pages of hits. Here&#x27;s a baker&#x27;s dozen of them:<p><pre><code>   - He who controls food, controls the world\n   - He who controls information, controls the world.\n   - Who controls the moon controls the World\n   - Whoever Controls Princess Diana, Controls the World\n   - He who controls the water controls the world\n   - Who controls Eurasia, controls the world\n   - He who controls the internet controls the world\n   - He who controls the branding controls the world\n   - Who controls money, controls the world\n   - who controls Jerusalem controls the world&#x27;s memory.\n   - He who controls the calendar, controls the world\n   - he who controls the seas controls the world\n   - The person who controls the oil controls the world\n</code></pre>\nYour argument so far is essentially &quot;Who controls Mars controls the industry of the Solar System.&quot; I believe that&#x27;s highly speculative and not reasonable.<p>I can be wrong. How is it likely that Mars will be the center of industry within the next, say, 200 years? What is the process of getting to that point?<p>You suggest that it&#x27;s easier access to &quot;most of the resources in the Solar System&quot;. How does the economics of that work out?

The kind of person who reflexively genuflects towards the current state-sponsored ideology, whatever it is (quick test: is Obama on your side?), because he loves the rush of feeling holier-than-thou.<p>Ah yes, someone who writes a simple tool to check for red flags and warnings common in job postings for their industry is totally a fascist looking to hunt down fellow citizens for the state.<p>> As an example, the lint checks that &quot;bro culture&quot; is bad, but female-friendly (like Minted.com[1]) is assumed to be good. All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. Very predictable.<p>Bro culture is bad, it implies the people working and doing the hiring are looking for a very narrow type of person and aren&#x27;t really open to having different kinds of people employed. Further, being woman-friendly is a huge plus, because usually that means women are able to access leadership roles in various capacities, something that isn&#x27;t common in our industry. Unless, of course, you think that companies that actively look to correct that imbalance are the problem, in which case I would pose that you are the problem.<p>> Like any neo-Puritan, he then comes after profanity, and beer, and even (god forbid) competitive-sounding job descriptions! His vision of the startup future: an HR drone stamping on a programmer&#x27;s face, forever.<p>Some people don&#x27;t like profanity in the workplace or highly competitive environments, those people have a right to know that info up front when looking at job descriptions. Nobody is forcing anyone to use this tool, there is no censorship being applied here.<p>Moreover, mentions of beer and alcohol in a job post are highly suspect, as such posts will automatically exclude people who don&#x27;t drink or are alcoholics. These types of places often base social activity around drinking and that can be highly alienating to a wide variety of people.<p>> People like this will spend their time being Adria-Richards-esque thought police rather than shipping code. Contrast with Max Levchin, who actually sold a startup for a billion-plus dollars:<p>Ah yes, because calling people out on dick jokes at a professional conference is exactly like the thought police. Also, that Max Levnchin has made money off of creating mono-culture workplaces doesn&#x27;t mean that is appropriate or correct for every company or potential employee.<p>>  If you want to work in an environment full of rowanmannings, that is your prerogative.

They have the same thesis.<p>TJ&#x27;s succeeds by having, to first order, zero to one brand of everything: If they stock it at all, it&#x27;s probably the TJ&#x27;s brand (secretly rebadged from its original manufacturer). This isn&#x27;t true for every category, but it is true for most.<p>This reduces many shopping decisions at TJ&#x27;s to binary ones: Is the TJ version of X good enough? Or not? The bad news is that any given packaged product has a decent chance of being lousy. But you may only need to learn that once, because there&#x27;s no other TJ&#x27;s product in its category to confuse it with.<p>When TJ&#x27;s is deemed good enough, your work is done. You do not need to decide between the deluxe and the basic version.  You do not need to try and remember which brand reminds your wife of her childhood and which brand she thinks tastes &quot;off&quot;. Your buying decision now fits comfortably in a single byte of memory.<p>When you stumble upon a TJ&#x27;s product you actually like, you can always find it again. The shelves are relatively free of the usual booby-traps, like the &quot;fat-free&quot; flavorless versions of everything that masquerade as the regular versions, or the Curse of the 174 Premium Brands All Named After Somebody&#x27;s Grandma that is the bane of Whole Foods shoppers who are trying to remember what they bought last month.<p>Having one brand of everything feeds viral loops. The word-of-mouth on TJ&#x27;s brands is astonishing. The canonical example is their two-dollar wine. Some people can&#x27;t tell the difference between two-buck-Chuck and vinegar, others can, but everybody knows which wine I&#x27;m talking about. I can send you out to buy a bottle (&quot;this is a product you will never forget&quot;) and be confident you will come back from the store with the right thing, which is frankly more than I can say for any other bottle of wine in the world.<p>Half of TJ&#x27;s products have their own cult. You bite into an appetizer at the party and exchange knowing glances with the host. Do you like what you&#x27;re tasting? Does the label look like a TJ&#x27;s label? You will be able to buy your own box tomorrow, with near-100% confidence.<p>It is true that if you don&#x27;t eat packaged products there is little point in Trader Joe&#x27;s; the produce is average At best, awful at worst. And if you&#x27;ve taken the time to develop actual taste in packaged products TJ&#x27;s is also useless, because unless your favorite brand is the TJ&#x27;s brand, your favorite brand is not there. My wife and I are\nbuying less and less stuff at TJ&#x27;s. But the one advantage that never goes away is efficiency. TJ&#x27;s stores are pretty small.

Humans are not rational in this way, and the abundance of free apps kills it for everybody else in the  market. If one company would start giving away really awful-quality  chocolate (or any product) for free in every supermarket, the chocolate prices & industry would crash.<p>Dan Arielly did a couple of interesting experiments on this. He had people paying for products in a cashier line (i.e. people who had their wallet out anyway) choose between two really good offers: Hershey chocolate for $0.10 and Lind chocolate for $0.20 (or something like that, I forgot the detailed numbers, it may have been $1/$2 or $0.5/$1). In that case, most people choose the more expensive Lind chocolate as it was clearly the superior product (i.e. higher quality). \nWhen he repeated the experiment with $0.10 for the Lind and $0.0 (i.e. Free) for the Hershey&#x27;s, the game changed. Everybody took the Hersheys. Even though the pricing didn&#x27;t really change, they only both became cheaper, by the same amount.<p>The verdict, really, is that if there&#x27;s something free around, we go nuts and quality doesn&#x27;t matter much anymore, because it is free. \nIf free apps, on the app store, would be at least $0.50, or even $0.10, I think it would totally change the game. (I.e. if Apple would change the Free Tier).<p>But as it is right now, I think the downward spiral will continue. The only way out is to create a high quality superior product (many features, etc) with a high price tag and hope that you get enough customers to survive.

Most of the time, I grossly over estimate how long something will take, i.e. &quot;all day&quot; when it&#x27;s probably only a 15 minute issue.<p>Of course, there is the opposite issue of grossly underestimating the problem. I&#x27;ve had &quot;close old checking account&quot; on my todo list for well over a two months now. I thought it would take 15 minutes to just call them, maybe scan a signature or something, and be done. They actually want me to come into the office, which is over 3 hours away (hence this issue of wanting to close the account). It is experiences like that that help to keep the gross-overestimation/procrastination game in business.<p>How do I fix it? I choose a day where I decide I will be fine if the only thing I get done is I find out how long it will take to get one thing done. Usually it&#x27;s not that bad, though.

Shouldn&#x27;t that cost more?<p>The reason that the prices are low is not because people are not prepared to pay for them. It&#x27;s because Google and Apple want it that way and also because developers are slashing prices to the extreme to compete.<p>Imagine if App store and Play store didn&#x27;t exist and you&#x27;d have to individually find developers and buy/download their apps. That would certainly result in higher prices.<p>The bottom line is app developers have no one to blame but themselves for creating this perception about their apps and allowing this expectation of $0.99 apps to grow.<p>People also have no freaking clue how hard it is to make apps. For example most people think mobile apps are a lot easier to make than software/web apps, perhaps because mobile devices are &#x27;small&#x27; so they tend to think of mobile apps as &#x27;tiny&#x27; little widgets that someone pushes 20 buttons and it magically gets created.<p>If a large enough group of people start raising awareness and refusing to release their work for peanuts we&#x27;ll see a shift in the market price towards more realistic numbers.",1380542653

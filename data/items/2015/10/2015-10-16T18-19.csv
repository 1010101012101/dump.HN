Placing a bet, notionally, has no impact on the event the bet covers; the fact you have entered into a bet over the outcome of a horse race is completely independent of the outcome. On the other hand, if you put your money into training a horse, and win back a share of its prize money, or stud value, or whatever, that is an investment, because your money contributed to the overall realization of value.<p>Insurance, I&#x27;ll grant, is a bet, but it&#x27;s a bet where you have skin in the game - a bet against yourself, to hedge against loss outside your control.

10401324,comment,10392044,10398200,0,0,gamegoblin,,,"I didn&#x27;t provide an example of the flexibility for sake of brevity.<p>The key point I want to make with regard to flexibility is the ability to have <i>multiple</i> &quot;instances&quot; and switch between them based on run-time values.<p>For a trivial example, consider searching an ordered array. Let me define the typeclass:<p><pre><code>    class Container a where
        type Item a
        size :: a -> Int
        contains :: Item a -> a -> Bool
</code></pre>
Now consider that I have the type SortedArray that I want to make an instance of Container.<p><pre><code>    instance Container (SortedArray a) where
        type Item (SortedArray a) = a
        size = sortedArraySize
        contains = ???
</code></pre>
What should my `contains` be? I could linear search or I could binary search. Depending on the size of the array, either could be faster (due to cache performance and constant overheads). For small arrays, linear search could be faster, and for large arrays, binary search could be faster.<p>I could write my method like this:<p><pre><code>    contains x xs = if size xs <= 64
        then linearSearch x xs
        else binarySearch x xs
</code></pre>
But having that 64 hard coded in is sort of lame. Suppose I am writing software that will run on unknown hardware. I don&#x27;t know the cache properties of it. Perhaps 16 is better. Perhaps 256. Since my application could be super high performance, I need it to be nearly optimal.<p>So on application start-up, I call a function which instantiates arrays of varying sizes and tries linear search vs. binary search to find the point at which one outperforms the other.<p>How can I use this value? I can&#x27;t inject it in place of that 64 above (without unsafePerformIO...).<p>The solution is to instead represent the typeclass at the value level:<p><pre><code>    data Container a b = Container
        { size :: a -> Int
        , contains :: b -> a -> Bool
        }
</code></pre>
Now I can have code that looks like:<p><pre><code>    main = do
        n <- findOptimalSearchSplitPoint

        let sortedArraySearch x xs = if sortedArraySize xs <= n
                then linearSearch x xs
                else binarySearch x xs
        let container = Container sortedArraySize sortedArraySearch
</code></pre>
Then I just inject that container &quot;instance&quot; wherever it needs to go.",1445021433

There is more of a science to it than one would believe at first glance.<p>For those who do that, the rewards can be significant.  One example is qualification.  Work smart, not hard.  Opportunity costs on poorly qualified deals is huge!  Often, the fall back is just to entertain a ton of deals and hope for good numbers.<p>A technical approach to this will yield dividends.  Good qualification requires a keen understanding of the prospect, their ability to buy, their willingness to buy and what their value perception is as opposed to what they are telling you it is.  Their process is critical too.  A poor selection process can have a major league impact on the overall potential for success.<p>Critical analysis of these things will focus you and your team onto closable deals more of the time.<p>It&#x27;s been a lot of fun, and I really do enjoy the more complex, high risk, high reward scenarios.  When you are part of, or are leading a great team, it&#x27;s all kick ass great!<p>The other place I&#x27;ve found I really enjoy is competitive analysis. Competing products overlap, and or offer different approaches to value.  How people see that value is complicated, and the competitive analysis can yield very high value information useful to your team, you as a sales person for qualification, and the product managers seeking to maximize the product.",1445021135

In lucid dreaming, I basically realize that I&#x27;m sleeping and then from there can direct the dreams.  In sleep paralysis, I&#x27;m in bed with my eyes open and experiencing hallucinations.  It&#x27;s not the same as dreaming as you are looking at real (and unreal) things.  For me, I can&#x27;t catch that inconsistency that makes it a dream.<p>To give you a good example, in a dream it is practically impossible to read.  If you are dreaming that you are reading, one of the tricks I have played to get into lucid dreaming is to try to say what I am reading.  It is either impossible, or it becomes absolute nonsense because there is nothing for you to read and your dream is skipping over that detail.  To get into lucid dreaming, you just need to notice that and then decide not to wake up.<p>For sleep paralysis, you actually <i>are</i> looking at your room.  You can see the pattern on the wallpaper in exact detail.  Everything is real (except for the hallucinations).  Also, you can&#x27;t move.<p>When I&#x27;ve got sleep paralysis, I usually feel like someone has broken into the house and I need to warn people.  But I can&#x27;t move a muscle.  I can&#x27;t speak.  Sometimes I will literally see people in my room.  Sometimes I will see other things (even bizarre things like flowers).<p>It&#x27;s interesting, though.  A colleague of mine opined that sleep paralysis was the absolute most terrifying thing on earth.  I said flippantly that I had it and it didn&#x27;t bother me much.<p>Unlike lucid dreaming, I don&#x27;t seem to be able to catch the inconsistencies in sleep paralysis.  But as soon as I realize that I can&#x27;t move, I get really pissed off and it overrides my fear.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I have a kind of internal explosion that starts in my stomach and gradually forces it&#x27;s way out and shatters the sleep paralysis.  Often I end up shouting something incoherently as I emerge from sleep.  As soon as I wake up, I feel absolutely pumped up and amazing -- empowered, I guess.<p>I hadn&#x27;t really thought about it, but I wonder if the lucid dreaming has allowed me to subconsciously recognize the paralysis and trigger a way to get out of it.",1445020662

Thus, if they get something working which seems to solve a problem, they stick with it. If this kind of software development is applied to the same source code throughout its entire life-cycle, we’re left with large amounts of code, a totally screwed code structure, and a flawed system design.

At the time of purchase, the ticket is worth exactly the price of the paper it&#x27;s printed on.<p>Here&#x27;s a better, less extreme but real example. I just purchased a mandolin from a seller of vintage guitars. Paid $750, and were I to be patient I could probably get $1200 out of it. I have no plans to sell it, as I bought it to play, but let&#x27;s supposed six months down the road I do sell it. Do I send a spiff back to Jimmy&#x27;s Vintage Guitars? Nope. Jimmy admittedly doesn&#x27;t know jack about mandolins.

Two reasons for that: such an instrument is worth several thousand dollars even in rough shape, and I don&#x27;t expect a person selling Grandpa&#x27;s mandolin at a yard sale to have any idea of its value. They&#x27;re not in the vintage instrument business, they shouldn&#x27;t be punished (too much) for not knowing what they&#x27;re selling. They get 10x what they were asking, and I still get a steal, everyone goes home very happy.<p>In the end, someone got lucky and it wasn&#x27;t the person that sold the picture.

Recipes vary from bean to bean, machine to machine, and based on personal preference, but they all generally specify the same 3 things: the mass of coffee going in (&quot;dose&quot;), the mass of the resulting shot, and the time for the extraction to complete.<p>I typically am pulling shots with Madcap&#x27;s Third Coast blend.  In their shop they target an 18.5g dose yielding a 31g shot completed in 25 seconds (with no pre-infusion).  The dependent variable here is the shot time.  Anything +/- 4 or more seconds is dumped in the sink as completely undrinkable.  The difference is not at all subtle - the shots are awful even to a novice palette.<p>The reason we have PIDs (and rotary pumps, heated group heads, calibrated tampers, doses measured to the 1/10th gram, etc) is to control every last variable that will impact this process.  Every variable here can and will create wild swings in the resulting shot time, so we fix everything we can as accurately as we can to avoid dumping $1 worth of espresso down the drain.  With everything else fixed, what we then control as the independent variable is the size of the grind.<p>This then is how espresso is tuned to land within the time given by your recipe.  Grind finer (smaller particles), the process will take longer.  Grind looser (larger particles), the process will run shorter.  Anything more than 3 seconds one way or the other is another dollar bill down the drain.  Very small changes in grind size can yield very large changes in the resulting extraction time.  Every time you miss the mark, another dollar bill hits the sink.<p>As a result, grinder performance is probably the single most important piece of the espresso puzzle, and it&#x27;s easy to quantify the difference.",1445020206

(mostly low level / embedded type programming)  Just for context.<p>Do you have people skills?  I got them from the performing arts and various other activities in my life.  Basically, if you have a personality and can just engage people, you may be well suited for sales.<p>Secondly, will you close?  This is the qualifier.  Lots of technical people will support the sales process, but are reluctant to close.  Asking for the business can be extremely difficult for some people.<p>Based on that qualifier, you may consider pre-sales, which is basically supporting sales people by defining the value proposition, technical proof of concept, discovery, demonstrations, competetive (fun), etc...<p>Or, you might consider sales and lead others to do your pre-sales support.<p>If you think you are the latter, you could do very well in enterprise sales as you have technical qualifications that really help you directly understand the deal, it&#x27;s worth, viability, etc...  You can also get some credibility strictly sales only people often find more difficult to establish, though the good ones do establish it by selling their team as well as the software solution.<p>Suggestions:<p>1.  Consider a VAR.  Many VAR type organizations aren&#x27;t always the best places to work longer term, but they are also more willing to take risks on good people wanting to get into sales.  Many are technically hungry and or wanting to improve on their close rates with better / more sales people.<p>You could approach a VAR for either pre-sales, or sales and perhaps accompany an existing team to learn the ropes.  From there, you would get your number and start hunting!  Or, you find you are more pre-sales oriented, and join a team and start helping put deals together.<p>2.  With no direct sales experience, you might also consider applying at an enterprise company for pre-sales.  This is a more formalized environment, and you will get a lot of exposure to the sales process, network with sales people, and maybe get some opportunities to close deals.<p>Good pre-sales people can be hard to find.  If you are personable and able to communicate complex concepts to people successfully, you probably won&#x27;t have much trouble.<p>Startups are a mixed bag, compared to established B2B enterprise companies.  Risk is higher, but so is the excitement level.<p>One thing you need to consider is risk / reward.  Many technical people are risk adverse and prefer consistent income.  If this is you, target pre-sales.<p>On the other hand, if you are fairly secure taking some risk, sales can pay very, very well.<p>Good luck.  Have fun!",1445019816

If the skill-set is worth more than 100/hr, then the company cant recruit the right talent, and complains of &quot;shortages&quot; whereas in reality, the &quot;shortage&quot; is because too many third parties have their hand in the cookie-jar leaving too little to pay the actual market wage.",1445019779

Here in the US, the typical cut is 20 to 75%.  For those recruiters who have negotiated higher cuts like 75%, it is usually due to an executive-level relationship...but they don&#x27;t keep the full 75%, they then sub-source the talent from secondary or even tertiary recruiters.<p>Lets take an example -- the worker makes 100/hr, the tertiary (recruiter who actually found the talent) gets 25/hr, the secondary (who vetted from multiple tertiaries) gets 25/hr, the primary (who plays golf with the CIO) gets 25/hr.  OK, perhaps the worker is well off at 100/hr, but this is a huge loss to the company -- three extra parties have taken a cut just because the HR manager didnt want to vet their own people.",1445019583

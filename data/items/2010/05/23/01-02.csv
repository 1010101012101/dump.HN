For instance, I am coerced by society into wearing clothes on a hot summer day; I might choose to strip naked, walk down to the river, and take a swim, but because I'm afraid of being arrested, I don't do such a thing.<p>Coercion can happen even when there isn't a direct threat of violence, however. You might make someone believe that they have no choice but to take the job you're offering at a strip club; even if in reality, there are other choices they could make that they might be happier with, if you convince them that it's your way or the highway, you've managed to coerce them.<p>This is a bad thing; it's a kind of fraud, something where you convince someone to do something on the basis of a lie, making them do things that they might not out of fear. Not everyone is a perfect, rational, utility-maximizing agent; everyone has fears, poor judgement about certain things, and the like. Manipulating that for your own ends is evil and wrong; and yes, there are sometimes small, mundane manipulations and coercions that you're never going to eliminate or are too small to be worth worrying about, but that doesn't excuse them, nor does it excuse more egregious coercion and fraud.",1274579909

Often as not, before Hangul was introduced in Korea, or Latin alphabets were modified for Vietnam, many people wrote their venacular using Chinese logograms, with the meaning known, but the word order and pronunciation adapted for their own language. Korean in particular has a whole class of special characters to capture the particulars of Korean grammar and language when written with Chinese characters. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja</a><p>Most Koreans will likewise pronounce Hanja using Korean words not Chinese ones. Like 'Dae' (대) for 大, 'In' (인) or 'Salam' (사람) for 人, 'Sal' (쌀) or 'Bap' (밥) for 稻.<p>You are right that, in the old days, because of the nature of the political ties betweem 韓國 and 中國, it was expected that formal government documents were written, read and pronounced in Chinese. But in general, most Koreans today do not know how to read Chinese out loud in a way that a Chinese speaker would understand. Most of the time Hanja is just used to clarify homophones from Koreanized loan words from Chinese.",1274579703

It requires a lot of patience because it takes months (some people have done it in one month, but they must be totally obsessed) and at the end of it you still can't read a thing, and, let's face it, learning 2000+ kanji is a beast of a job regardless of what technique you use. But if you can handle delayed gratification, it'll do the job. I can't say how it compares to brute force, but I don't think I would have finished 2000 kanji the brute force way. I don't think kanji are really a big problem after Heisig book 1, especially if you're reading online with Rikaichan or something like that, but you'll still see quite a few unfamiliar ones.<p>If you do it, check out <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kanji.koohii.com/</a> and read the stories that other people have posted, if you haven't already.

It was the rigid simplicity,the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission.

I'll get to the point, but first let's define clearly, what is an allergy, an intolerance and what's coeliac disease.<p>Some raw numbers, wheat (gluten) allergies affect less than 1% of the population (it's something like .48%). It's not something you can hide, you either swell up and stop breathing when you come in contact with it or you don't. It's actually hard to find in adults as most people grow out of it when they enter puberty. If you don't die within a short time from eating wheat (without treatment) due to an IgE antibody surge, you aren't allergic -- full stop. (yes, there are emergent allergies that occur later in life, gluten allergies are generally not considered to be in the class of those types of allergies). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgE</a><p>Wheat (gluten) intolerance is more prevalent. But so are most food intolerances. For example, it's generally considered that 3/4 of the adult population of the U.S. has a dairy intolerance. Intolerance != allergy. You can eat foods you are intolerant to. It might give you an upset stomach or bad gas or some such, maybe diarrhea and a really bad headache. But by those symptoms most of us are intolerant of high fiber diets, coffee and all forms of strong alcohol. It might be worse, like dizziness or some such, but if you don't have IgE antibodies in your system after contact with the suspect food it's not an allergy. In other words, probably 100% of the population is intolerant of <i>some</i> food some of the time. People often mistake ""allergic"" with ""intolerant"". Allergies are far more severe and critical than intolerance. Intolerance comes from a lack of an ability to process a given external agent due to some genetic predisposition -- like how many East Asians can't process alcohol properly or MSG makes my Aunt get a headache.<p>Coeliac disease occurs in about .75% of the population (as identified so far). It is a distinct and different disease from gluten allergies and gluten intolerances. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the body destroys the lining (the villi) of the intestine as a response to the presence of the <i>byproduct</i> of gluten after it's been improperly modified by a faulty enzyme causing an IgA antibody flareup in the gut. It's only now really being diagnosed as it is easily confused with other bowel diseases prior (like IBS or Ulcerative colitis or granulomatous among others). Recent IgA antibody tests do a pretty good job of positively identifying the disease (but you have to be on a gluten rich diet for it to work, otherwise you'll have no antibodies to test for!). The number may grow, but probably not much, even wildly high estimates put it at under 3% of very localized, genetically predisposed populations. Whatever the case, it presents as a chronic disease, not an allergy. You don't eat wheat, then blow up, stop breathing and die. Your intestine slowly rots away, you become malnourished and your feces turns white.<p>Likewise, food intolerance != Coeliac disease != food allergy. The three things are different. You may as well bundle people with sun allergies and who have dry skin from harsh soap into your numbers if you are going to do that. The <i>only</i> common factor is that the causative agent is the same -- wheat. But even if you add up all the numbers of people with wheat allergies and people with coeliac disease, you likely end up with something less than 3-4% of the general population.<p>""Dangerous Grains"" is an interesting book. But if all you look for is a duck, suddenly everything starts to look like a duck. I'd caution anyone from self-diagnosing based on descriptions of layman oriented symptoms from a book written to popularize an interesting theory. Many things cause precisely the same symptoms as gluten intolerance (and visa-versa). Dangerous Grains, while an great way to popularize recent science with the layman, is not the same as medical science.",1274577459

Maybe the officer could fabricate a traffic charge, which you could contest. (I'll agree you're likely screwed there - when it comes to traffic infractions you're guilty until proven innocent.) The officer might decide he smells something and force a search which makes you late for an appointment. Unfortunate for sure, and spiteful on the officer's part. But I don't think this reaches the level of martyrdom, and it'd be worth the shot of pride I get from defending my rights (though I understand not everyone would feel that way).<p>Am I missing something? What else could a cop do that doesn't require documented evidence of wrongdoing? I suppose Chicago-level corruption could wreck your life, and if that's the environment you're in then it's probably best to keep your head down.

And in Western countries, people's survival needs have mostly been fulfilled. Thus the majority of people choose to turn their attention to emotional needs/goals (love and belonging, friendship, confidence) instead of value creation because this type of activity gives them immediate (versus lagged) rewards by being part of a larger social group, even if the activity itself is not rational (does not create value).",1274576594

This is because there is no doctrine of precedent in Germany. Previous decisions don't bind courts the way they do in common-law jurisdictions.

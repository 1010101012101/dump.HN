In both cases, there is extensive content that you <i>cannot</i> complete without large raiding teams.<p>The Diablo series however has always been a single-player game with an added multiplayer component.

There used to be a lot of different GPU manufacturers for PC's out there also 15 years ago.<p>These sort of things tend to become more standardized after at least a few years have past, and not only the OS is more compatible with different hardware, but there are fewer manufacturers to worry about, too, once the leaders of the market have been set, and the manufacturers themselves work on making their own hardware and drivers more compatible with previous versions once the market is stable.<p>The author actually says that Android fragmentation is <i>less</i> of a problem than on the web or even on Windows!

It's inherent in the game design, and it serves more purpose than just preventing copying.<p>Blizzard actually has a pretty lenient and I'd say modern approach to DRM. Which is that you buy a product key and you can then download and install the game -- for Windows or OS X -- as many times as you want on as many computers as you want. Any friend can come over and play on your computer on their own account -- assuming they have a valid account -- by simply logging in. I think that's pretty solid.<p>Now, whether you agree with Diablo 3's online only design or not is a different story. But it's not a DRM issue any more than the fact that WoW, EverQuest, Second Life or many other games cannot be played without being online. To label it as a DRM issue is disingenuous.<p>Personally I think the Real Money Auction House is stupid, and it definitely wasn't worth the tradeoff. But the decision has long since been made, the time for this discussion was long ago when the RMAH was announced. It was obvious at that time that local play would never be an option.

However, each company operates within its own context and the popular way may not be the appropriate way for a particular company.<p>For Yottaa, from our background and industry experience (In my previous life, I  started and grew an enterprise software company to profitability. I have also been involved with quite a few startups from initial formation to successful exits),   we knew there is a $billion market for what we do because it is a proven market (It really doesn't take a genius to know there is a big market for web performance, monitoring and security). We also knew that we can execute on the ideas (normally it would take some real work to convince others about one's execution capability. Fortunately in our case, our decisions don't require us convincing other people to make). So we can skip the some of the initial ""validated learning"" process (not entirely, but a part of it). It is risky to skip some of it - however, that is the risk we decided to take anyway.<p>More importantly, as I learned from personal experiences,  the biggest startup challenge is growth. The major hurdle to success is not financing, getting the first 10 customers,  getting to the first million dollar revenue or even the first $5M revenue - we have done these before and lots of people have done these before. However, it is exponentially challenging to grow from $10M to $100M in revenue. Out of 1000 startups, there may be 100 get funded and 50 actually get to a million dollar in revenue, but there are probably only 5 get to $50M revenue.<p>Another important aspect to take into consideration is the kind of product that we are building at Yottaa. As highly distributed software service that optimizes and processes Internet traffic in real time, it takes more than five smart engineers to reach the basic level of performance, reliability and scalability.<p>There are quite a few other reasons that drove this decision that I wont bore you folks further. In the end, we decided to take the approach we took. After a lot of real hard work and experiments, we have figured out the right process, people and methodology to be extremely effective and scalable. We have been able to roll out a major product every 3 months:<p>Late 2011: Site Optimizer
Jan 2012: Web Performance API
Feb 2012: Yottaa CDN
May 2012: Yottaa Mobile Acceleration Service
(lots more coming soon).<p>The pace of development and efficiency is fairly rapid. In 6 months, our Optimizer has grown to from 0 to over 100M unique visitors per month. So we are definitely seeing the benefits of our model now.<p>How successful can this model be? Time will tell.",1337708378

In many, they're better - being able to rap with Justin Kan about PR or Garry Tan about design is gold.<p>The one noticeable weakness is the decreasing familiarity between founders in the batch. My first time through, all the founders knew each other by name. This second time, there were other founders I still had trouble recognizing in the bathroom line at demo day.

Metro with a mouse kind of sucks, if I'm being honest. Metro with something like this would feel a lot more like direct manipulation, which is what touch UI delivers.",1337707947

It's what made McDonald's famous.<p>The idea was that the warming bin would always be stocked with product and historical data was collected to know <i>how</i> much to stock at a given hour of a certain day of the week.  But food could only live in there for 10 minutes before (by the rules) being trashed.  Of course, a sudden bus arrival or freak rainstorm could wreck all of those plans.  And (hint hint), the 10 minute rule was disobeyed a lot because management was tracking food waste percentages.  Wasted food took away from profits...which took away from their bonuses.<p>The other downside was that food that had been sitting in that warming bin for 9-12 minutes (typ) started to taste bad.  People liked Wendy's and BK <i>because</i> their orders were fresh.  Customization was another problem.  McD custom orders could throw the entire workflow off if the grill staff wasn't in a good rhythm or if they weren't actually making product at the time of the order.  Oh, you want a Filet-o-Fish with no salt?  Get ready to wait 7-9 minutes.<p>So, fast forward 25 years and McDonald's is now making single orders in a bespoke fashion, ala Wendy's or BK.

I'd also never use a laptop on Muni.<p>My own pro-tip (as a four-year resident) is learning to ride a bike in the city is an outstanding way to improve your accessibility while avoiding the Muni/parking headache. It's much easier in some neighborhoods than others, but in general, almost any part of the city has routes that avoid hills and high-traffic streets, and you may be shocked at how easily you can get to places that used to seem like a major hassle. Personally, it's made SF an easy and enjoyable place to get around, instead of a constant pain.<p>For anyone considering it, just do it, but follow a few key tips: avoid riding too close to parked cars (dooring risk); wear a helmet always and use lights at night; consult Google Maps bike directions or the official SF Bike map for ideal routes; ride conscientiously and follow the rules of the road, even if you see others breaking them (e.g. stop at lights/stop signs and yield to pedestrians); don't ride too fast, especially through intersections, since being able to stop quickly can save you from almost any collision; do your first ride sometime when there's very little traffic, like early on a weekend morning; get a practical city bike, not a speed-demon road racer. Cycling with a friend who knows what they're doing is also extremely helpful.<p>Some people have a bias against cyclists because there are plenty of inconsiderate riders, but that shouldn't prevent you from taking advantage of this super useful and generally safe mode (if you ride safely). If you do take it up, please add to the ranks of considerate riders, and enjoy cutting that multiple-transfer-bus-ride or multiple-parking-ticket car commute out of your daily schedule.",1337706795

If people like muraiki could say ""yeah, I trained pretty hard for CounterStrike in my college days. Almost went pro but decided I wanted to focus on other things. Got fond memories of it though"".<p>That is, is the difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" obsessions purely subjective and cultural? (Example of a good obsession: recently I read the book ""Mastery"", where the author describes his years of practicing Aikido almost nightly. Aikido is probably close to useless in real life but the author was greatly enriched by his training. And the enrichment wasn't despite the fact his training was often repetitive, it was <i>because</i> it was so repetitive and ""dull"").<p>Or is there an objective criteria for distinguishing between good an bad obsessions? Here's my criteria, good obsessions are good for at least one of:<p>- your health
- your wealth
- your social circle
- etc<p>And bad obsessions are bad for at least one of those. So if you're an avid gamer, but you don't let it go so far as to effect your health, and you actively go to LAN parties or gaming expos and make real friends through that, then that's a healthy obsession.<p>Or if you're an online poker player or day trader that loses significant money, that's an unhealthy obsession (because it would be rational to stop). If you make money, then it's a healthy obsession. If you only lose insignificant amounts of money, then it's just a hobby and isn't really good or bad.<p>I actually only admitted to myself this year that I'm actually obsessed with startups. I realised that most close friends I made over the last few years had ever a strong interest or active involvement in entrepreneurship and instead of trying to fight it (eg, like thinking it was kind of lame that I've been to more tech conferences than music concerts), I should just double down on that and build a social circle out of my startup obsession.",1337706238

4008703,comment,4007047,4007520,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The genius of google's ads is that they can be so much different. When you search for something targeted ads are far more common to be relevant and useful. Facebook is still struggling with its ad technology and paradigm, and right now they have a very clunky, old fashioned system. Throw ads in the user's face, collect money. The principle being that a well made ad can get someone to buy something they didn't want to buy before. But that's the old and busted way of doing things. It's the way that shows adult diaper ads to 20 year olds, and baby diaper ads to 60 year olds.<p>It's based on the premise that you can auction off people's attention to the highest bidder. And to some degree yes, that still does work, a little. In the 21st century there are better ways. The best ""advertising"" is not recognizable as advertising at all. It's greasing the wheels of people buying something they already want. If you look at amazon, for example, they have the recommendations system, an extensive product review system, and a referral system. All of these are there to help guide people into buying <i>something</i>. Amazon is best served when a customer buys something they actually want, as is google. It strengthens their brand and deepens user engagement. This is precisely what facebook needs to be doing but haven't, partly because unlike with google, any degree of advertising is intrusive on the experience of using facebook. And if they get into the cycle of just dumping more and more generic, ""attention auction"" ads on their users then they will have failed. People will merely ignore the ads or they will spend their time elsewhere if the site becomes too obnoxious to use.",1337706183

If you paid close attention to what they were actually investing in, you might have seen that the prospectus wasn't telling the right story.<p>In all honesty though, I don't think people would have invested that much differently had they known.  People are so used to FDIC insured bank accounts, they don't realize that maturity mismatching in an uninsured account will always lead to bank run.  Of course, because of the perception that the government was going to insure the accounts, the government actually did have to insure the accounts.  So no one has actually lost money in the money market funds.  It was all paid for by the inflation tax.",1225198195

If you're waiting on someone to type an essay (or 5 full blog entries) before you've even set up your font grids, then you'll be in trouble.<p>If you're working with specific copy, attention-grabbing copy, then the exact wording of that is on every bit the same level of detail as the rest of the design and it's pretty necessary to have a good rough draft of the wording before you start crafting the appearance.<p>At the end of the day though, I find myself using Lipsum all the time to very good effect.",1225197131
346240,comment,345148,346033,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Well, you know - I liked Kevin. We were friends and collaborators and I think in the first half of 2005 we did great stuff. If I had to say who built digg into what it is, it was really a collaboration between Kevin, Daniel Burka and me, with valuable support from Ron Gorodetsky. By the time of the series A we had huge, huge momentum.<p>It was in a way sort of like the Beatles, just the right people put together mostly by accident and we worked magic. Then Yoko (Jay Adelson) came along, and the ego stroking began. Kevin was a genius, I was just a ""contract programmer.""<p>And I'd say the results speak for themselves. Digg is stagnant and boring. Almost every feature on there was actually created in that early 2005 timeframe, though obviously greatly refined since then.<p>I'm trying to move on, involved in a great project again, with great people, and I regret saying nasty stuff or sounding bitter, but sometimes I'm reminded how much fun it was, and how easily it was turned to not-fun.",1225197043

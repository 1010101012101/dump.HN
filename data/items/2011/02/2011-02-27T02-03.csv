It's amazingly important to have someone around whose job it is to handle tasks not related to the core business, but which are not easily outsourced.<p>Obvious? Maybe. But I've worked for, and observed, too many small companies in which either a co-founder founder ends up doing office-manager crap or it gets offloaded onto the first tech employee who's convenient.  It should not be the tech staff's job to restock the fridge, replace office supplies, handle invoicing, pay the rent, ...",1298775501

The comparison is considered fair whenever it favors Northern Europe, so why is it unfair when NE doesn't do as well?<p>> US is a single country with a common language and culture.<p>True, but that doesn't explain why the comparison is fair in some cases and not others.<p>>> So, why is their GDP so much lower? We keep hearing how much better they are, so why doesn't it show up in output?<p>> In my opinion it's not a good comparison.<p>How about some support for that opinion?  (And, as I noted, no one complains about such comparisions when they're trying to make the US look bad.)<p>> If we look at the GDP per capita, you will find lots of states with lower rates than many European countries.<p>Actually, you find a few states that would be in the middle/low europe and a fair number of states that are over the top.<p>But, so what?  There's variation between and within European countries.  There's variation between and within US states.<p>That doesn't change the fact that US per-capita GDP is significantly higher.<p>> If there was something special about the US political system that generates wealth, you would expect the results to be more evenly distributed.<p>Why would you expect that?<p>The US poor fare rather well on an absolute scale.<p>You seem to think that what your neighbor has matters more than what you have.  I disagree.<p>As to ""relatively similar culture"", the US TV culture is fairly uniform and the areas that techsters see are fairly similar, but go to south San Jose and tell me that it's just like Palo Alto.  Heck, go to East Palo Alto and Redwood City.  (They're not the same.)<p>If you're willing to travel a bit more (the US is big), there is lots of cultural diversity.  Do you really think that Madison Wisconsin is much like Dry Creek Missouri?",1298775478
2267177,comment,2266788,2266788,0,0,brianstorms,,,"My discomfort with AngelList stems from what I see as a disproportionate advantage on the buyer side (the investors), with less advantage going to the seller side (the startups).<p>For investors, AL is a firehose of Shiny. If you're a Shiny junkie, then connecting the IV tube of AL into your veins will keep you wired into dealflow like nothing before.  Instant gratification, severe acceleration.<p>For startups, you hear the occasional startup praising AL with stories like ""we posted our profile and 3 days later we have $600K woo-hoo!"" but my question is, until I see AL post detailed stats and analytics, I assume that for every success story there are dozens, scores, or even hundreds of stories where basically nothing happened.<p>I would gladly be proven wrong: Nivi, Naval?<p>Lastly, I get the brilliance of AL, I get that it works because there are tons of investors signing up, but it's the scale that worries me.  As it scales, the win rate for entrepreneurs will just get worse.  Has to.<p>A similar thing exists in the publishing world with literary agents and editors.  (Heck, there, writers (the entrepreneurs in this analogy) have to go through TWO hoops not just one, to get an advance (investment)).  There are too many writers and not enough agents and even less publishers, it's a very very tight funnel and rejection is the norm.<p>AL will probably wind up this way too, unless AL thinks of ways to improve the service to better balance the features, acountability, and responsiveness of each party.  I want to see investors being forced to respond to investors who've submitted their pitch to them specifically, within a set amount of time, or lose reputation points.  AL should facilitate rapid communication between both parties, but it seems that all AL does now is email investors when entrepreneurs submit companies to specific investors, and at that point AL's job is done and the ball is in the investor's court.  Not enough.  AL should be all over the investor and help the entrepreneur get closure as soon as possible with each investor they submit to -- even if the answer is no.  Any answer is better than silence.",1298775469

2267152,comment,2265790,2265790,0,0,runningdogx,,,"I don't understand the fetish with caching every variation for every user.<p>Here's a thought: dynamic apps should render a page exactly one way in html, and rely on javascript and cookies to post-process the site so it APPEARS to be customized for that particular user.  That includes admin widgets.<p>That particularly applies for displaying how many minutes ago something was generated.  Serve it with a date-time format, use javascript to post-process into ""x seconds ago"" or ""x minutes ago"".<p>If someone isn't logged in, or isn't an admin, and they hack their javascript to display user or admin stuff, who cares?  The user/admin requests sent to the webserver won't succeed anyway, because they rely on having an admin session cookie.<p>If there's meaningful rather than just UI stuff that users or admins get to see, then you have to cache that separately, but you can even do stuff like loading it dynamically with js so the publicly visible (cached) content can still be used, and you cut down the amount of stuff your server has to auto-generate.  It can cache the separate pages (xml, json, whatever) that serve the logged-in user content, as well.",1298774518

In a large company with many quasi-independent units (such as various R&D groups, a group running production simulations, etc), I've seen ""private clouds"" allow a generic infrastructure to provide dynamically-sized resources to those varied groups.

If you want full persistence, everything's going to have to hit the disk anyway no matter how you phrase it and how and when you store it.

If google wants to fix their search results, they should focus on fixing adsense. The technology to more accurately measure a viewer's exposure to an ad are there, it just needs a trustworthy player to bring it to market. Someone trusted by both users and advertisers.<p>Google made click/impression-based advertising appealing to both groups and it made them what they are now. It's time to get away from it.",1298772806

Small and new brands are walking on eggshells trying to balance self-promotion without pissing off Google.  Meanwhile larger brands regularly practice black- or gray-hat SEO and survive because Google can't as easily remove a larger brand from their results.  But if you're small, Google can and will kill you in an instant without recourse.  The ramifications of this are bad for the internet -- it means higher barriers to entry for startups.",1298772661

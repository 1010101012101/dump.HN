9320079,comment,9319822,9319901,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is a freeze, not a forfeiture. Also, it won&#x27;t affect people in terms of legal advice, plea deals etc. because it only applies to people who launch attacks on critical infrastructure from outside the country, and thus beyond the reach of US police. The differences are subtle, but significant. It&#x27;s basically the same mechanism we use against other sanctioned targets such as terrorist organizations: <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/t11sdn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/t11sdn.pdf</a><p>This would not affect, for example, the people who engineered the Sony data breach or any of the various cyberattacks against retail or service companies that have been in the news in recent years.<p>Your worries about the constitutional basis for executive orders are misplaced, I think. Bear in mind that the President <i>is</i> in charge of the executive branch; this order promulgates a policy rule for executive agencies, ie, should the relevant event occur, DoJ is instructed to launch proceedings* to have the assets frozen. Think of it as a statement about how the administration will exercise its lawfully delegated powers going forward.<p>Edit: I said DoJ but the process starts with Treasury adding the person to the SDN list and proceeding from there by established means, though the doJ would get involved with that down the line, most likely. Sorry if that was confusing.<p>* by applying to a court for the authority, not on its own authority or on the authority of the order itself",1428127037

9320073,comment,9319822,9319822,0,0,legutierr,,,"I think that people participating in this thread might have a substantial misunderstanding of this executive order.  This does not seem to create a policy whereby law enforcement can arbitrarily seize property owned by accused hackers.  Asset forfeiture as a drug war tool is extremely problematic, and deserving of debate, but this is not that.<p>Instead, this allows &quot;the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State&quot; to add a list of foreign hackers &quot;located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States&quot; to the &quot;Specially Designated Nationals&quot; list that Treasury maintains (at the Office of Foreign Asset Control).  All US businesses, but especially financial institutions, who have an affirmative requirement to know their customers, have an obligation to not do business with entities listed on the SDN list.<p>I am not a lawyer, but I have in the past written software intended to detect transactions by people on the SDN list.  It is of finite length, it is publicly available for review, and individuals and businesses can only be added to it if an explicit decision is made at the cabinet level (as per my recollection).<p>In general, I would think that HN would see this executive order as a good thing, because it will create a tool for the US to penalize criminal hackers that otherwise would be hiding in Russia, Iran or China.  It is profoundly unlikely that these powers would be directed at any US persons, unless they were found to be dealing directly with the people enumerated on this public list.",1428126922

9320064,comment,9317567,9318560,0,0,dasil003,,,"Hm, I&#x27;m not sure about the parallels between Lisp and Haskell, and the conclusion that they are primarily valued for showing off.  Yes, they are appealing to programmers with that mentality because they are powerful languages that are difficult to learn and use effectively.  However beyond that they diverge dramatically.<p>Lisp is a language with no syntax, it is like an unshaped lump of clay.  It gives you total freedom to implement any computational construct you can imagine.  This does allow greater productivity for very small teams, and maybe it&#x27;s <i>the</i> most powerful tool for <i>the</i> smartest programmer, however it doesn&#x27;t offer anything to improve the practice of maintenance and reuse.  This is why no viable ecosystem ever coalesced around Lisp, and in fact why there are so bloody many Lisps to begin with: because it is attractive primarily to individuals who want to build their own special flower.<p>Haskell gains its power in an almost opposite way by its type system, it&#x27;s an extremely rigid structure which contributes tremendously to code reuse and maintainability.  It works because great effort was put into the type inference so that it is strong yet lightweight.<p>IMHO as a seasoned programmer who has spent 5+ years and 7+ years on individual projects, I can definitely see that Haskell is addressing real world problems in a way that Lisp can not.  I use ruby day to day, and frankly it&#x27;s good enough in its meta-programming ability to solve most of the pain that Lisp solves compared to say Java or C++.  However when I look at the problems which creep in over a period of years, the code rot, these are things which Haskell trivially prevents while half-hearted type systems like Java don&#x27;t really put a dent in.<p>I think the reason Haskell hasn&#x27;t seen more adoption is simply because of the current value of shipping fast.  However we are in the midst of a Cambrian Explosion of software, and I believe that as the maintenance costs become apparent (as well as parallelization increasing), that the scales will tip towards many functional programming ideas.  Maybe it won&#x27;t be Haskell that sees mainstream adoption, but at the moment it has the most powerful embodiment of these ideas.  I wouldn&#x27;t bet against it based on the parable of Lisp.",1428126751

Given the sheer number of breaches, and the variety of organizations that have been breached, I suspect that most Americans have had their information compromised by hackers at least once.<p>We&#x27;re also regularly seeing breaches of major companies for the purposes of economic espionage, and disruption of service as a political or economic tactic.

Doing a opsworks/chef setup like this isn&#x27;t appealing - over time we want to have many microservices which can be scaled independently, and you don&#x27;t want to be doing a lot of setup for each one. It&#x27;s also complex to setup the kinds of scaling and rollbacks with git deploys like you can get on Heroku.<p>Right now Deis or Flynn looks best, giving most of the advantages of Heroku, but they are also pretty immature. Deis only just got the ability to send logs to a syslog instance, and can&#x27;t be upgraded without either building a new cluster and migrating across (lots of work), or doing a in-place upgrade, which could mean up to 10 mins of downtime.<p>Flynn has no ability to send logs to an syslog server from what I can see, and seems even more immature than Deis, but looks like it might have a better technical foundation.<p>I&#x27;ve also been evaluating Amazon&#x27;s Elastic Container Service, but that is unfortunately also very immature - No load balancing integration yet and also no information on logging, rollbacks, etc.<p>Elastic beanstalk is also interesting in a way, but we already have one app deployed on it using Docker and it&#x27;s not great - logging is a kludge using a logger running in each container, and you either use your own docker repository (in which case you can&#x27;t do rollbacks), or give them a zipfile with a Dockerfile and your app, which allows rollbacks but means the docker image gets built by every server in the cluster. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to have any way of easily running and scaling multiple processes per app like you can with the Procfile on Heroku.<p>Anybody else in a similar situation? It seems that there are a bunch of interesting projects that will be very competitive with Heroku soon, but nothing that&#x27;s really matured yet.<p>I wish Heroku would just introduce a new range of PX (running on their own EC2 instance) Dynos without the crazy pricing - right now the only PX dyno they have is $500 per month when you can get a substantially faster instance on EC2 for ~170 per month.",1428126214

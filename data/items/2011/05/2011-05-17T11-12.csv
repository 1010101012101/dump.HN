They derive their long-term profits from sales of fabricated fuel assemblies."" :)<p>The principal difference of this type of reactor is that all the stuff (fuel, fission products, etc) aren't piled and accumulated in the reactor core. Instead, it is flows in, burns, flows out, filtered/reprocessed, flows in ...<p>General scare tactic utilised by the industry to preserve status-quo is expressed nicely here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor</a><p>""As one director of a U.S. research laboratory put it, ""fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve: advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes. The technology may be proven, but people are not""<p>Basically - if you force us to make something new, it will be even more risky and we've warned you.<p>Another quote from there : ""Nuclear engineer David Lochbaum has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. "" .<p>Complete BS - nor Chernobyl, nor Fukushima have nothing to do with their technology being most recent as 1.their technology hasn't been most recent 2.it has to do with morons - Chernobyl, and unplanned for high tsunami - Fukushima and if i remember TMI was also not about new technology.",1305632896

We sell a hosted daily deal solution for online retailers, and we manage everything from marketing to the actual sales transactions of the deals. I was wondering which business model would make more sense for both our customers (the retailers) and ourselves.<p>We currently use a recurring billing model (with 30-day free trial), but we haven't been seeing good sales with that model. Should we switch? Make the monthly fee cheaper, or shorter/longer trial period? Or should we move to a pay-per-sale a.k.a. commission model? Or a combination of both, i.e. monthly billing + small cut for each sale?<p>No doubt, we can analyse which business model would be more profitable if we had a lot of data, but we don't. I was wondering if you guys have a preference based on gut feel, experience, or some reasoning.<p>Pay-per-sale seems to align our interests with those of our customers, thus making it a softer sell, but if we don't make much sales for our customers, our revenue will be pretty much stuck. Monthly recurring billing ensures predictability of revenue (allowing for churn), but would seem to leave a lot of money on the table if our customers get a substantial amount of sales out of our tool.<p>What do you think?",1305630678

The increasing practice in some other European countries is to allow a greater scope for English in the sciences and engineering.<p>In particular, any official thesis or report must be in French, which means that the thesis itself won't be widely read/cited internationally, <i>and</i> means that it can't be directly chopped up to make English-language journal articles; the student would have to translate their own thesis to republish parts of it in journals. In addition, they aren't generally required to be able to: since everything official is done in French, it's not necessary for a student to have English writing skills of a level sufficient to write for a scientific journal (though they do generally need English <i>reading</i> skills sufficient to read papers in their area).",1305630653

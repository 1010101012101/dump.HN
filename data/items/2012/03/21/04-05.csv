3733159,comment,3730896,3731301,2,0,secretwhistle,,,"Charles, I'm the author of the idiotic article and I thought I'd wade in and explain my comment about not wanting to hear another rundown on why the system is the way it is.<p>Over at Techdirt, a site I've been reading for a half-decade and contributing to for nearly a year, IP issues compose probably 80-90% of the posts. The reason I inserted that particular paragraph was to head off discussion centered around rehashing multi-national licensing nightmares and instead get some sort of explanation as to why this isn't being fixed faster.<p>Obviously, there is a multitude of systems already in place and extricating ourselves from this won't be easy and won't happen quickly. But rather than working to streamline these processes, representatives of content industries are spending a great deal of their time (and lobbying power) trying to do the impossible: stamp out piracy.<p>Most people don't need an excuse to pirate content, but situations like this push people who otherwise would have purchased something into finding an alternate route or doing without, neither of which will make the labels (or studios or whatever) happy.<p>There's a lot of numbers thrown around equating each torrent to a lost sale. Actual lost sales due to speed bumps and hurdles in the distribution are rarely discussed by the industry and when they are, they result in horrendous ""solutions"" like Ultraviolet or the ""drive your DVD to the retailer in order to rip a copy to the cloud.""<p>So, if I'm ignoring the ""why"" behind the situation (which I don't believe I am), it's because the point of the article was ""Don't cry about piracy if you can't give me an option to buy.""<p>We know the system is a tangled mess. We know there are many more middlemen than there needs to be. We (and every time I use ""we,"" I'm speaking broadly from my experience as a writer/reader of Techdirt) don't believe ALL middlemen are useless. Many of them DO add value, but when you've got several middlemen guarding turf in several different locales, all hoping to carve a slice of a digital good, it leads to this. And knowing every detail of ""how"" and ""why"" a particular band can't sell a particular album via the internet to you simply because of where you live doesn't change the fact that it's frustrating for fans who want to support artists and, I would imagine, greatly frustrating for the artists themselves, who need all the paying fans they can get.<p>So, we can engage the real nature of the problem, but unless someone towards the top starts slicing away at the undergrowth surrounding worldwide distribution, not much will change.<p>There are some great comments here. I found yours to be very informative as well as the contributions from commieneko and Gfischer. Both raise very good points about this situation. In short, the systems in place can't adjust as quickly as the market does. (Or in some cases, won't.) But back to the point of my post: you (this would be the royal version, not you personally, Charles) really shouldn't be hollering about piracy when you're unable (and in some cases, unwilling) to let would-be paying customers give you their money.<p>(P.S. I don't really consider myself a journalist. I'm sure many, many people would agree with me.)",1332304813

In the chatroom example, there isn't much involved because it appears to be so generic, but as you innovate more and more, this ID/UX becomes increasingly challenging.<p>One slightly related design problem would be, for example, how the buddy list on facebook chat works. One could classify users into groups, allow you to 'pin' a user at the top, expose more ways to have group conversations. While, one could always argue for the simplest possible solution (i.e. one big list!), it's not always the best for the user and I would read anything that helps in guiding processes to discover and decide what is best for the user. In my experience, good UI is often far less controversial than good ID/UX and less of an issue when keeping a team happy and excited about a product.

Nine Inch Nails - Year Zero (2007)-- This album was released by Reznor as a free digital download and Reznor also released the master tracks and encouraged remixes of the work.<p>YZ was actually the last album in Reznor's contractual obligation to Interscope. He leaked a number of tracks as part of the accompanying ARG, but the album itself wasn't free. I seem to remember him having to jump through a number of hoops to get the masters released, as well.<p>Also: keep in mind that Saul Williams had attempted a pay-what-you-want model with the Reznor-produced <i>The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</i> prior to any of the other releases you mentioned.",1332302804
3733061,comment,3732385,3732385,37,0,Lazare,,,"Watch a bird take off.  Start with some pigeons, then some sea gulls.  If you can, watch an albatross - on YouTube if nothing else.  As you get larger, you get heavier; as you get heavier you need more lifting force (ie, bigger wings, moving faster).  Recall that weight is a function of volume and increases with the cube of your dimensions, while lifting force is a function of surface area and only increases with the square of your dimensions.   Very <i>very</i> roughly if you're twice as big, you get four times the surface area but eight times the weight, meaning that as you get larger flying goes from being ""difficult"" to impossible.  And a man is large, and the batteries and motors he was allegedly using just add weight.<p>All of which is a long way of saying that he runs very slowly, his wings are very small, and they flap very slowly.  The first couple seconds of him after take off our patently absurd; you need to be applying - somehow - hundreds of pounds of force to the air to push you off the ground.  Yes, fine, he has a wonderful wing design and some amazing motors and (apparently) zero weight batteries.  Fantastic!  But none of the components in that video are producing hundreds of pounds of force.  (A commenter at Wired estimates that the servo motors are theoretically applying enough force to pick up a two ton load, in fraction of a second.  If we had this tech, we could fly, although <i>that</i> wing design probably couldn't.  We could also make Iron Man-style powered armour.  Unfortunately, we don't have this tech.)  The whole thing is multiple orders of magnitude off from the realm of ""remotely possible"".<p>There are just so <i>many</i> red flags.  The bizarre edits, the poor filming, the ridiculous design of the wing, the secrecy, the way nobody in the video acts right, the way the wing magically changes designs in different shots, the fact that the wing is clearly not fully loaded, the weird clothing and gear choices, etc., etc., etc.  Wired has been hoaxed <i>hard</i>.",1332302751

In the very end of the compilation the compiler emits machine code or some kind of byte code, which is imperative by nature.<p>Before that, the compiler must do a lot of analysis and optimization. All of which happens in some intermediate representation, which is as little imperative as possible. In order to get there, the compiler does different control flow and data flow analyses such as live variable analysis, the goal of which is to turn mutable variables into immutable values. It has a resemblance to functional programming in some sense (you can read research papers about SSA, single static assignment and it's equivalence to CPS, continuation passing style, if you're interested).<p>So in the end, we get assembly or some kind of byte code, but a lot of magic happens to get there. Back in the 1970's, C was like portable assembler. These days the compiler does so much magic that it's not true any more.<p>We could use any language as the source language for compilation but yet we stick to an ill-fitted C-based languages that are really painful for the compiler and the programmer.",1342780602

You can 'extend' an existing table by specifying the child identifier as a primary and foreign key referencing the parent table (this is called 1 to 1 mapping).<p>Most of the time when you see 1 to 1 mapping you won't see it, because in relational databases you add those columns to the same table. There are some scenarios where it makes sense to split the table into two tables, such as a User and an Account table (AccountId = UserId), so you can better model the relationships.<p>Most people would advise against it and tell you to denormalize those tables (put everything on the user table), but if you use an orm that does class-per-table mapping it really reduces friction (ex. anything referencing an Account is accessable from an account, everything referencing a User specifically won't be directly accessable via the Account).<p>There's also a difference between key-value stores and object-oriented-databases (both being NOSQL). The reason why using NOSQL is 'closer' to your actual objects is because you would be storing actual objects (they get serialized into a graphs and stored).<p>I'd also suggest you check out Brewer's CAP Theorem: <a href=""http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theor...</a>",1342780421

I had the same fear not with sending invoices but more precisely pricing proposal. I would fear that my prices would be too high, that perhaps I would lose the job because of that. That maybe (deep thoughts) that I wasn't worth the money I was asking for (Thankfully I'm not longer thinking this way).<p>And every time I would send that pricing proposal only after re-reading it 10 times to make sure I leave enough space so I can back down without looking like a total idiot, I would receive an email accepting the pricing proposal and thus re-enforcing that I wasn't charging too much and that everything was ok.<p>It's important to understand that through your pricing you are setting the perceived value of your services. If you price them too low, people won't bother taking you because their perception of your value will be low. If your price is too high you might be perceived as too greedy.<p>The last part of your blog post resonated really well with me as well, as an entrepreneur you need to build an entourage of good people who can support and help you overcome you inner fears but also challenge you when they think you're wrong.

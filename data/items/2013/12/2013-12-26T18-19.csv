Have you never wondered why you can learn python in a day or two, but not English or Chinese?<p>First of, you need a huge dictionary of all words and rules for their conjugations. \nThen you need a huge rule set for bound morphemes. Which adjectives can you add &#x27;ly&#x27; to in order to make them adverbs? There are literally hundreds if not thousands of bound morphemes and they can sometimes only be applied to certain words within certain word-classes.<p>Then you need a huge rule set for when each word acts as a specific word class (is bank a noun or a verb? Is anime a noun or an adjective? Is like a verb or preposition? You know, &quot;Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana&quot;, actually like can behave like several wordclasses)<p>These are not solved problems yet, but we are getting very good at them now. We weren&#x27;t 4 years ago.<p>Failing that, you could also take and annotate word classes in thousands of pages of text, and then use a machine algorithm to apply similar annotations in the the text entered into the program. Unless you are expecting people to write articles for the Wall Street Journal, this might not be such a good route either.",1388084394

Such a course is often called &quot;Advanced Calculus&quot;, and is a required course for a Bachelors-level education in Math. I also understand in the European-style approach to teaching Math, students start off with a foundational approach to Calculus through Real Analysis, and not the hand-wavy & computation-driven Calculus course.<p>The equivalence class approach attributed to Cantor is more generalizable in discussing sets. The theoretical foundation of Fourier Transforms lies in a similar completion of functions.",1388084348

Everything is bad, from the developer hardware/tools to the red tape.<p>The bug tracking system looks like an HTML 1.0 web page.  The &quot;database version&quot; is a required field, even though the product you work on doesn&#x27;t even use a database. I seem to remember having problems linking to issues, because the the URL was just a hashed session so you couldn&#x27;t even bookmark things.<p>You want to use that open source library that everyone else is using and does exactly what you need?  All you need to do is fill out a bunch of on-line forms where you explain the material impact of using this library and how much money your BU makes and how this affects the bottom line.  Once you get through all that, your request needs to travel all the way up the food chain to the office of the CEO which can take months of harassing administrative assistants of very highly payed people for that to actually happen.  This doesn&#x27;t even take into account the legal approval steps that need to happen which also takes a while.<p>While this is going on, you have to work with your 3rd party library and hope that it gets approved or risk months of wasted work.  In the end, you notice that other people don&#x27;t even try and use 3rd party libraries because it&#x27;s so frustrating.  In the end they just try and re-invent the wheel, and because a certain percentage of your team has to be in a &quot;low cost center&quot;, the library ends up sucking.<p>Recap: Amazon has nothing to worry about, because nothing innovative or powerful is going to come out of Oracle.",1388084325

I&#x27;d like to amplify it.<p>A lot of <i>imperative</i> languages end up being really similar once you&#x27;ve learned a few of them. I&#x27;m not an expert on PL history but, AIUI, ALGOL was the progenitor for many modern languages, especially imperative ones. So it makes sense as to why, but there are paradigms other than imperative or even functional.<p>Of course this is not to say that all imperative languages are the same. Rather it is to say that alikeness is relative. Relative to C, Java is quite different. Relative to Prolog or Forth, C and Java are more similar than not.<p>If anyone really wants to expand their brain to new ways of thinking wrt programming, I think exploring these off-the-beaten-path programming languages is a great idea.

There&#x27;s always an offset, and the fuzziness I&#x27;m speaking of is how much slop is included to trigger simultaneity. Generally, it&#x27;s little enough that it gives the appearance of FIFO in practice, but the law specifies positional yielding. I&#x27;m speaking in reference to OH and OR law, here. The laws don&#x27;t say “whomever stopped first gets right of way.” They say something to the effect of, “You must stop at a stop sign. If there is another car to your right at the intersection, you must yield to it.” The relevant phrasing from the Oregon revised statutes is “After stopping, the driver shall yield the right of way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when the driver is moving across or within the intersection.”[1] It&#x27;s actually quite fuzzy. Many laws are, which is part of why we rely on human juries and judges to make sensible decisions about conflicts.<p>1.

Secondly, Ireland had to go through 70 years of near-poverty, only briefly managing to getting close to digging itself out of its economic hole in the 1960s. Thirdly, with independence, Ireland lost most of its industrial homeland due to partition, as well has having to effectively buy itself back from the UK through the payment of land annuities, and the subsequent trade war that happened when the Irish state refused their payment, owing to the size of the amount demanded, utterly crippled the Irish economy.<p>Arguably, from an economic point of view, Irish secession from the UK <i>was</i> foolhardy. The fact that almost a century later The Economist <i>now</i> considers the Republic largely a positive example has zero relation to how they would consider and independent Scotland. Ireland was a basketcase for decades.<p>Also, &#x27;secession&#x27; is the act of gaining independence. There&#x27;s nothing pejorative about it.<p>Also, Ireland does have substantial oil and natural gas reserves off its coast.

However, my advice would be to keep things as simple as possible, especially since it seems you guys are starting out.<p>For the frontend, I&#x27;d recommend either just having very thin pages in your Rails stack that are fully or at least heavily cached that then ping your API, or relying on something like Jekyll to generate static pages that then do the same.<p>Eventually, when the project becomes larger and/if you start feeling pain points, you can abstract this frontend layer away from the stack into its own little app.  You could also make it its own little Rails or Sinatra app that just serves basically HTML (again, heavily cached, since the dynamic content will come from the backend).  I keep recommending keeping it in Rails or Sinatra just so you can use some goodies like layouts, easy caching infrastructure, you&#x27;re already hosting rails, the asset pipeline.<p>As for your marketing site, I&#x27;d go for something that&#x27;s hosted elsewhere, like Tumblr if you need a blog, etc.  Just try to minimize the things you need to host and support yourselves.",1388083873

Here&#x27;s some general ones:<p>* More instances will give you more requests/second, but only so long as secondary system (database, search server, whatever) can keep up with the load<p>* N+1 queries will kill your performance. They can add a lot of time to processing requests.<p>* Everything in the most used parts of your site should hit an index on the database. If it&#x27;s not I can almost guarantee it will be slow.<p>* Look for work that you can move &quot;offline&quot;. As long as they go out within a minute nobody will notice that you aren&#x27;t sending emails at the exact time they are being generated. Move that work to a background queue so your web server can just add a queue entry and get on to the next request.<p>* Cache anything you reasonably can. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper (i.e. faster) to read from a cache than to do a database lookup. It&#x27;s cheaper to read from a cache than to render an ERB template. Caching can introduce its own difficulties, but the performance gains can be worth it.<p>Without knowing some specifics of your implementation I really can&#x27;t give you better advice. Depending on the specific libraries you use it might not even be possible to move to JRuby due to support for C extensions.

They had a choice to do it this way.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it was that simple, considering that the Nortel portfolio covers a wide array of different technology areas and industries. What other feasible choice did they have? Transfer the patents to themselves? Six companies were involved, each infringing different subsets of the portfolio: who gets what patents? Even if they did divvy up the portfolio somehow, they certainly weren&#x27;t going to keep them lying around, not after paying so much for them -- They had to be licensed. Splitting the portfolio would not only make it weaker, but it would mean multiple individual licensing efforts. Rockstar currently fulfills the same function that MPEG-LA does.<p><i>> And &quot;operate autonomously&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean much when you first fill the subsidiary with nothing but litigators and patents that have already been licensed to everyone meaningful other than the parent&#x27;s competitors.</i><p>If you read the document linked in the comment I cited, no, those patents were not licensed to anybody meaningful until the auction. But licensing efforts were on the way years when they were still owned by Nortel and before Rockstar was created, so pretty much everybody knew what was coming. That is why all these companies, including Google, were bidding for these patents in the billions.<p><i>> It&#x27;s like setting loose a rabid animal near your competitor&#x27;s business and then trying to disclaim responsibility because the animal was &quot;operating autonomously.&quot; What did they expect to happen?</i><p>Well, they paid billions for these patents. Is it fair to them that other infringers get away scott free?<p><i>> Lawsuits against Google&#x27;s customers instead of Google.</i><p>Google makes pretty much no money directly from Android. This inherently makes it difficult to extract damages from them. Not to mention that since Google bought Motorola, they do have lawsuits directly against Google as well.<p><i>> Suppose Apple files a suit against an Android manufacturer, then a year into the litigation they show up and say &quot;oh hi, we just bought some new patents, so let&#x27;s throw out all the work we did getting to this point in the trial and start over.&quot; That clearly stinks of harassment...</i><p>That&#x27;s not how patent lawsuits work. Dozens or hundreds of patents are involved in a portfolio, but it&#x27;s not feasible to sue over more than a handful of them, because court resources are extremely limited.  If you see how past patent lawsuits have progressed, companies assert a small bunch of patents and over time winnow them down to an even smaller number that are mostly likely to prevail. It&#x27;s actually rare to see new patents being asserted partway through a lawsuit because, as you said, it annoys judges -- typically a whole new lawsuit is filed instead, which is a whole lot of extra work.<p>This is intrinsically unfair to the patent-owners with large portfolios, because no matter how many patents are being infringed, they only get to assert a few, and even if they prevail, damages are limited to the patents asserted. This is why companies try to get injunctions -- that is the only way to get enough leverage to properly license an entire portfolio.<p>Multiple lawsuits seem like harassment only if you disregard the flip side of the coin, which is widespread infringement.<p><i>> By filing the litigation through Rockstar, they get a separate trial with two bites at the apple in front of two juries, the litigation costs more for the target because they have to defend two overlapping cases in different courts instead of having them consolidated, and they can do it again and again with different troll subsidiaries until their smaller competitors are destroyed.</i><p>If different patents and/or different products are involved, the cases are not overlapping, so it&#x27;s not the same apple that they&#x27;re getting bites at.",1388083365

It is meant to imply the intuition that real numbers are what we typically think of as &quot;numbers&quot;, notably that they extend to infinity, are ordered, and are dense (for any two distinct real numbers, there exists a real number between them). Of course from a rigorous perspective, this does not even suggest a difference between the reals and the rationals.<p>The line you are talking about in the rest of your post seems to be an &#x27;unrelated&#x27; object that is used in geometry.

No one is making &quot;Oracle-like margins on enterprise applications&quot; in the cloud...yet...not anytime soon in this competitive market.<p>This is the opportunity in IaaS/PaaS as I see it: every large company in the world typically outsources their operations systems infrastructure. Here&#x27;s an example - a company based in Europe that does €7b in revenue. Let&#x27;s call them Big, Co. They have a myriad of technology partners - Oracle, SAP, HP, IBM...you name it, they have it. Anyway, one of their partners, Atos, provides infrastructure services for them based in Austria. So, let&#x27;s say the CIO decides that the HR department is going to use SAP HCM to support HR. Some manager at some level calls up Atos and says &quot;Alright we need 6 HP ProLiant servers, Oracle 10g installed on 3 of them, and SAP HCM installed&quot;. This process takes months. To everyone in the web world who&#x27;s unfamiliar with enterprise - this is the equivalent of installing a LAMP stack on EC2. So you can see the disparity between the two (months vs minutes). The problem is - none of the enterprise technologies (Oracle 10g or HP ProLiant blades for example) are sold as commodities...they&#x27;re &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;enterprise grade&quot;. So here&#x27;s the opportunity - do what Amazon did for the web in the enterprise. So, let&#x27;s say you want SAP HCM, well that&#x27;s simple, have support spin you up a server with a pre-installed set of technologies (like a LAMP stack!) and then let some implementation managers go and install it. Here are the problems for Oracle (and pretty much anyone at this point):<p>1- Cross-platform ecosystem is shit when it comes to APIs (integration is normally much bigger of a challenge than the implementation itself)<p>2- Oracle isn&#x27;t good at integrating all of it&#x27;s &quot;parts&quot;. They have a strong hardware/OS company (Sun), a strong db brand (oracle), and very strong best in breed software (Peoplesoft, etc), but they&#x27;ve been working in silos their whole lives. It isn&#x27;t their strong point to do integration (just as SAP has been abysmal at acquisitions)<p>3- The margins absolutely suck in SaaS. Look at Salesforce, Workday, Amazon, etc. They are all negative or razor thin. Oracle and SAP are used to 85% gross margin on software. This will take a lot to gut (mainly from stockholders)",1388082827

Normally inmates could only visit the library once a week and check out two books, but I read about 4 books a day during my time there.<p>I fixed up the computers and supported them once they got a teacher, read my books, helped people with grammar in their appeal letters, and stayed out of trouble.<p>The only stress I felt was from being thrown into an environment with totally alien social structures and ways of interaction. I was a upper-middle-class white kid who had learned to talk logically out of situations, and most of my peers in prison were people who grew up in settings where the only way to solve disagreements was with intimidation or actual violence.<p>Once I learned that I should give a little to intimidation so the other party feels in control and powerful, but refuse to be totally controlled because the other party wouldn&#x27;t risk their early release dates to beat up someone for no good reason, then I did well. It also helped to be able to pay off the local gang leader once a week with a pint of ice cream from the commissary. Protection was relatively inexpensive, all things considered.<p>The library was outdated, but there were enough books on physics for me to refresh my understanding and my friends and family ordered books for delivery for me on a regular basis. I discovered a life-long love of Mark Twain, especially the book he wrote about Joan of Arc.<p>6 Months seemed to crawl by and was full of home-sickness. Then, all of a sudden, it was over. After that, the world seemed a lot more magical for a few months. Everything was brighter and more colorful than I remembered. There was such joy in being able to listen to a CD or eat chinese food.<p>All in all, it wasn&#x27;t a terrible experience. It was very interesting sociologically and a good experience for me to see how a different ecosystem worked. I also got to eat a balanced diet and exercised. I was in marvelous shape back then. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or anything, but if you go with the right mentality, you can make the most of it.<p>The obvious downside is that prison sticks to you for the rest of your life. It takes several months to stop walking without your hands behind your back or saying &quot;Sir&quot; all the time. Also, the stigma of having a criminal record sticks to you forever. Even now, in my middle 30&#x27;s, it&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to get a tech job even though my felonious history was from when I was a teenager. You pretty much have to resign yourself to the fact that you&#x27;ll work at 50% of the salary as your peers or have to make your own future by starting your own companies and projects.",1388082780

On the latter note, there is also this sobering paragraph:<p><i>...Here in Colorado we have what is called &quot;mandatory parole&quot; - which is probably not what you think it is.  It does not mean that it is mandatory to release you early, it means that even if you are released after serving your entire sentence, you will be considered &quot;on parole&quot; and will have a parole officer assigned and live under the threat of being sent back to prison (even if you already served your entire sentence).  Hence, you could do almost 15 years on a 10 year sentence because if you are released after doing the 10, you will still have to do 5 years of &quot;parole&quot; and could be sent back if you violate any of the terms of parole.  In fact, nearly 40% of the intake into Colorado prisons is from &quot;technical&quot; parole violations, which are violations of parole conditions that are not felony crimes.  This system has created a terrible sense of hopelessness among those caught up in it.  My assessment (admittedly based on anecdotal data) is that Colorado parole officers think it is their duty to try and find reasons to violate a parolee and get them sent back to prison.  They seem to go out of their way to make success difficult for a parolee, rather than just expect compliance with the law.</i><p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Prisons-and-Prison-Life/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-geek-in-a-prison/answers/3504930/comment/3226629\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.quora.com/Prisons-and-Prison-Life/What-is-it-like...</a>",1388082180

When you have less java code and more xml, it is often faster to come up to speed on a new spring project because the xml more quickly describes how the project is integrated - maintenance and tweaks can often be more straightforward.  In contrast, Java code and annotations often feel friendlier for the actual process of developing.<p>I do think I prefer the java way more, because it&#x27;s a bit easier to debug.

Very understandable because Atlas Shrugged is a novel, not a formal philosophy treatise, so how would you know any better? (Without spending a crap ton of time studying other Objectivist literature, that is, like I did.) Major because Objectivism is induced from reality, not deduced.<p>For instance, take ethics. The Objectivist ethics looks at the nature of man and then figures out what man needs to have a happy life. Well, how do we know about the nature of man? We don&#x27;t deduce it from A is A; that would be impossible. Rather, we look at lots and lots of examples of men and determine what is always common vs. what differs from one to the next.<p>Almost everything in Rand&#x27;s philosophy is very bottom-up, based on looking at tons and tons of examples out there in reality and then forming a generalization that holds in a specific, delimited context.

I&#x27;m just accurately labeling the situation.<p>Google&#x27;s dominant position constitutes a &#x27;monopoly&#x27; and &#x27;monopoly market power&#x27;, in a common understanding of those words, and in the senses often used by economists and regulators. Their search market has very high &#x27;barriers to entry&#x27;, in terms of costs-to-compete, ability-to-reach-customers, returns-to-scale, and network-effects. (Separate from all the specific things I mentioned which make it extremely hard for entrants to get a foothold, you can also just look at the profits. Whenever there are big profits, there are business &#x27;moats&#x27;, or else someone else would grab a bunch of those profits themselves.)<p>This makes them a likely target of government antitrust action – an observation which is true whether or not such antitrust laws, and related enforcement actions, are a good idea or not. Again, I&#x27;m interested in accurately describing what exists, not making moral or policy judgements.<p>Qwiki? Really? They never offered ranked search, abandoned their &#x27;visual explainer&#x27; product long ago, and are now part of Yahoo with their multimedia storytelling app.<p>DDG, Blekko, and all search sites other than Google/Bing/Yahoo/Aol/Ask are together less than 0.3%-1% of the US market. And yet this market is wildly profitable for Google – and almost no one else. (Bing, the distant 2nd-place, has lost hundreds of millions every quarter since 2007.) That&#x27;s not an indication of vibrant easy-entry competition: one company dominates market-share and profits, and the number of competitors and new entrants have been declining over time.<p>By the way, the founder of your &#x27;compete easily&#x27; example Blekko also disagrees with your assessment, and has since the outset of Blekko. In this 2007 post he describes how it&#x27;s impossible to compete for market share head-on with Google due to its &quot;immense and amazing power&quot; in a &quot;winner-take-all market&quot;:<p><a href=\"http://www.skrenta.com/2007/01/winnertakeall_google_and_the_t.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.skrenta.com/2007/01/winnertakeall_google_and_the_...</a>",1388081523

Or Coinbase have some sort of a preferential treatment program? My Case # is 73898.",1388080825

Cats  and dogs are evolved with different priorities, as are primates, and have ingenuities that surprise one another, except when the others stop watching.   I&#x27;ve seen cats learn how doors work by just watching, doorknobs, etc.   They are clever, geometrically, but humans seem to resonate with the more vocal/verbal and generally cooperative nature of dogs, as it&#x27;s a very primate characteristic.",1392116388

Outrage ensued from all sides. Two &#x27;workarounds&#x27; were created:<p>* People just donate to the pub owner to pay the fines if the inspector came around
 * Certain bars had no personnel, just the owner; ergo, no personnel, so no requirement to create a smoke-free environment for personnel, so, smoke away.<p>Others are things like speeding (everyone does it, gets a fine on rare occasions, only the extreme ones get their license impounded), downloading music/software, etc.",1392116304

7216946,comment,7216658,7216899,4,0,arethuza,,,"Personally, having worked on AI research in the late 80s and early 90s I don&#x27;t observe a lot of progress in replicating general intelligence. Of course, there has been a huge amount of progress in special purpose systems leveraging the huge amount of computing power we have now - but the fundamentals of general intelligence look as puzzling now as they did 20 years ago. I don&#x27;t believe that we really have the right algorithms and it&#x27;s simply a matter of scaling up the underlying hardware.<p>I think the most likely way to achieve a &quot;real&quot; general intelligence will be by reverse engineering how functioning brains and minds work. At least is an area where continual, albeit rather slow, progress is being made - <i>eventually</i> we will know how the mind works (assuming that there isn&#x27;t anything fundamentally weird going on - which seems unlikely).<p>Once we understand how minds actually work I suspect there should be a good chance that we can upgrade/optimize these structures - either by architectural improvements or by throwing more resources at the areas that constrain current performance in biological brains. At that point things really could get rather exciting - but I don&#x27;t expect this to happen in my lifetime (I&#x27;m in my 40s).",1392116171

7216933,comment,7211514,7211514,1,0,Kuroi,,,"I think I understand the idea behind the video, but to me it looks like an experiment made by a very inexperienced advertiser. This guy could be a <i>god walking between mere mortals</i> on AdWords, but he surely lacks experience with Facebook advertising. Let me summarize why:<p>- <i>wrongly setted advertising</i>: Google AdWords and Facebook Ads work in a completely different way. If you try to do advertising with Facebook the same way you do with AdWords... you are going to fail for sure. I work in a start-up that does Facebook Advertisng (AdEspresso [1] ) and I struggle to make customers understand the equation <i>new instrument</i>=<i>new things to learn</i>. The problem with fake clicks exists and has a lot of reasons, but is marginal and partially avoidable. It worsen if you do everything to avoid really interested people (fake page, wrong targets), I don&#x27;t find it strange that you only get fake clicks (and really expensive ones!).<p>- <i>how to evaluate the effectiveness of an advertising campaign</i>: the classic and easiest way to measure ROI is the LCA (Last Click Attribution) and is when you click on the ad → do the conversion, some browsing or less than 30 days in the middle are usually not a problem to keep the connection between those two actions. The classic example is AdWords when you are looking for a new razor. But what happens if I see a cool advertisement on Facebook about a cruise but it&#x27;s not time yet for my holidays? I may like the page, visit it, and keep in mind that  there is this really cool agency that sells fantastic cruises. It will come a time when I can ask for holidays at work, I&#x27;ll remember the agency name and I&#x27;ll google it looking for their website, also I may click on one of their ads because is between the top results. Next I buy the cruise: who gets the goal an who is the real dealer? That&#x27;s why you look for Multi Touch Attribution models (MTA). Brand building and brand awareness are serious stuff.<p>[1] <a href=""http://adespresso.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adespresso.com</a>",1392115933

As a strong believer in the &quot;subsidiarity principle&quot; (things should be decided as locally as they can), I&#x27;ve been appalled at the push towards centralization of policies and control in many European countries the last decade.<p>It seems that everybody thinks that if local issues are made national policy, and national issues European policy, things will automatically be better. Usually it starts because in one locality, something goes wrong, resulting in media outrage and a call for more regulation by a higher government. If we don&#x27;t watch out, small town sidewalk planning will be done in Brussels.<p>The recent Dutch drug policy changes show that with enough effort, the subsidiarity principle can still win. This gives me some confidence for the future. We need to keep underlining that not every place is the same.",1392113870

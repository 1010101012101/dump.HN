There was almost nothing similar to those days except the basic names of some of the parts &quot;video card&quot;, &quot;case&quot; etc. I also build my last machine some 7 years ago and even from then the industry has moved fast enough that almost nothing is recognizable.<p>Slots are all different, the variety of RAM types is astonishing and there are more form factors, cooling solutions, hard drive types and motherboard types than you can shake a stick at.<p>Turns out the internet is a <i>very</i> good resource these days for benchmarks, price comparisons, compatibility reports etc. It really only took me 3 or 4 evenings to get back up to speed with the state of the art (ASUS had a great series of videos on NewEgg about their latest motherboard line), put together some rough sketches of systems and started to price them out. A couple iterations later and I settled on a configuration and placed my order.<p>A few days later everything arrived, and even though I had never touched an SSD before, had everything assembled in 2 very lazy evenings. Instructions are provided these days with most of the parts and aren&#x27;t too bad. I probably did a couple things not-quite-right, but everything seems to work fine so.<p>I expect this system to give me 5-7 years of service and it ran well under $2k. Has an SSD for the main drive and 4TB of secondary storage, 32GB of RAM, not &quot;quite&quot; top of the line video (but pretty beastly), 4 cores on the latest intel architecture. It chews up games and emulation with ease and I actually do my day-to-day work inside of a couple of VMs that you barely notice are running.<p>So yeah, it took a few more days of my time for research, but now I know the hardware scene a lot better and the time from order to fully usable system wasn&#x27;t terribly longer than ordering a complete box.<p>For fun, I tried to spec out an Alienware and came up with a system not quite as fast, with less storage for about a $1k more.",1389105423

That complaint has been raised against Google <i>many</i> times, because Google&#x27;s index captures not only what you say in public, but what others say about you, even if you feel that it is misleading. For example, if a news story comes out about me being implicated in a crime, and 1 week later, I&#x27;m completely exonerated...but whoever wrote the headline used poorer SEO, and fewer people cared 1 week later...Google, via algorithm, may rank the outdated story higher.<p>There&#x27;s very little recourse because, on technical grounds alone, it is tricky to do. But in a &quot;moral&quot; sense, once you make that move for someone, how do you argue that you don&#x27;t do it for someone else in a similar situation?<p>The Googler spoke in a place that would not legally be considered private and he is not naive about technology. Is the OP a jerk? Sure. But that&#x27;s not the topic here....the topic is, would <i>Digital Ocean</i> have been a jerk to say &quot;Sorry buddy, but we can&#x27;t just take a blog down because you regret your comments&quot;?<p>IMO, No. And it&#x27;s not because DO is a jerk. Anymore than Google is for not taking down clearly harmful -- but not <i>illegal</i> -- results. As Matt Cutts put it:<p><a href=""http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/remove-page-from-google/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/remove-page-from-google/</a><p>> *Unfortunately thereâ€™s not much I can do. The page you pointed out is not spam, and pretty much the only removals (at least in the U.S., which is what I know about) that we do for legal reasons are if a court orders us. We typically say that if person A doesnâ€™t like a webpage B, only removing page B out of Googleâ€™s search results doesnâ€™t do any good because webpage B is still there (e.g. it can be found by going to it directly or through other search engines). In that sense, the presence of that page in Googleâ€™s index is just reflecting the fact that the page exists on the wider web....There you have it. People usually arenâ€™t happy to hear that reply, but I hope they can understand the reasoning behind it.<p>So if you&#x27;re talking about ethics, what DO did here, IMO, crossed a line, because now it sets a very low bar for what is privacy and what is defamation. If the OP quoted the Googler correctly...and the Googler offered his opinion knowing that it was being read...he may not like how his comments were interpreted or published, but he doesn&#x27;t have legal recourse.<p>For the record, &quot;off the record&quot; has no real legal standing. It&#x27;s a term reporters use to set the boundaries with their sources...if they break it, then it&#x27;s unlikely sources will talk to those reporters again. In this case, of course, the Googler can exercise that right to not speak to the OP again. But it really shouldn&#x27;t be up to DO to intervene on his behalf in such a ham-fisted way.",1389103524

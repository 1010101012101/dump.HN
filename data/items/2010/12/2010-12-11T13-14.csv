Used your invite code to get an account.<p>I was a little skeptical about the idea, but when I saw my own timeline after they pulled information from my social accounts, I must say that I was impressed. Actually seeing your timeline laid out in an easily accessible manner is a powerful (and more than a little nostalgic) experience.<p>One thing though is that they put the same emphasis to all my posts/tweets/facebook events etc. And there is a lot of 'junk' in my timeline. I wish they had some way of figuring out what is important to me and have display emphasis on the important nodes (mirror the way I think). Pretty neat in it's current beta stage nonetheless.",1292075996

Do for loops in delphi/pascal iterate 'up to' or 'up to and including' ?<p>If they iterate 'up to' then:<p>It would seem to me that on the initial call to 'quicksort' the '1000' gets passed in to 'r', the value of 'r' then gets passed in to 'j'.<p>Now if ""'a[j]' < p"" will refer to the uninitialized value in a[1000] and compare it to p, the first decrement will not take place, i<=j and now the code will swap with a[i] with a[1000].<p>This should cause the uninitialized value (0?) to end up as the first element in the sorted output array.<p>I hope I analyzed that correct, I don't have access to a pascal/delphi compiler here.<p>When you run your code do you see the output starting with a '0' element ?<p>Is there another element from the input array missing in the output ?<p>If pascal/delphi loops iterate up-to-and-including did you actually intend to sort an array of 1001 elements ?",1292075932

In many cases it is the simplest starting point to ensure you have a working environment.<p>As far as familiarizing myself with a new language, I usually write a Hello World, then add some variables, and some functions or whatever is relevant, and just focus on the syntax of the language, or in the case of a platform or framework, take a look at building trivial components.<p>Not a language, but a platform example: I recently explored ExpressJS (If you're not familiar, its a framework for node.js web apps.) and my workflow was: Make a hello world server, Add a few routes and a static handler, Add some views, Add some middleware, Build it into a basic blog. (Because it's always a blog first, right?)<p>The whole process was quite quick and gave me a very strong jumping point for ExpressJS.

(act well grounded, speak slowly and softly, look people in the eyes when talking to them, act caring)<p>nurturing broad interests is also not too hard: decide often you think somehting is interesting... nobody likes everything, but not liking (or disliking) something clearly raises barriers in getting to know new people. for instance i dont care much for football (soccer), actually i dont care much for sports in general: by this i miss out on a lot of easy socializing. [i consider to start liking sports just for this reason]<p>for making intimate relations (opposite sex or same sex, im openminded here) i suggest using the friendship route. just build a friendship, but make sure to let know you are interested in getting intimate in a polite manner: a long hug, a kiss on the cheek, a hand kiss, expressing you really like him/her. rejection is not a big of a deal when you build friendship first -- it is not bad to have friends that you would like to get intimate with but are not.<p>it helps to get intimate with people if you feel comfy with your body. so dance, practice yoga, taichi, sports, gym, or what ever... i prefer dance. :)<p>please let me know if this was helpful advice.",1292075211

It seemed like ever business man in America could not figure out how to get on this outsourcing craze and fire all of their development staff. A lot of us saw it happen to our good friends, and some of us where too close to the hot seat for comfort. It's unfortunate and it's unfair to you personally, but people like to attach a face to their outrage given that it was Indians taking their jobs naturally they became the face of their frustration. Not everyone thinks like this, and I don't believe that their is racist intent, eastern Europeans experienced this as well, they where late to the cheap outsourcing game so it was less sever, I imaging that if they had been as early to the game as India, they would see the same amount of discontent taken out on them.<p>The second and I believe more sever issue, is cultural differences in the way India and America do business. It is no great secret that as a culture you guys do not like to deliver bad news. I think it is because as a culture you are as well far more respectful than Americans on average. Coming from the American south, I see this all the time. As a culture we in the south had a concept called southern gentry (this culture has died out) part of there culture is that your are considered of a less social status if you are not hospitable and respectful, there are a group of people that see this as a weakness due to a mis-match of cultures. I was part of the first generation in the south that was more culturally compatible with the rest of America so I see the contrast between the two very well.<p>Anyway I am derailing with back story to get to my point, the point is this aversion to bad news when applied at the management and project management level can be disastrous to a project. Not getting a complete picture of the bad issues can leave people in the dark and hamper their decision making process. 9 times out of 10, when I hear an India outsourcing horror story it has everything to do with the management of the project and nothing to do with the quality of the developers.<p>You guys experienced a gold rush, when we decided to outsource development to you, some of your business infrastructure and practices where not ready to do so, it is a natural product of two cultures colliding. I would not take it personal, and would recommend trying to look at the human issues involved, something American developers would be well served to do as well.",1292074978

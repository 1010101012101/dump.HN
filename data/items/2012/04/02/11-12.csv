You don't get the ""Go Away!"" message, but instead you get an insufficiently tested experience which exposes the lack of attention on quality - that's something that's going to turn away an audience geared to wanting to see quality.<p>If you are going to publicly stop supporting an entire browser range, make sure your developers don't leave obvious gaps in that non-support.

However, I first programmed back in 1985 on a Compaq Deskpro Portable computer (640 KB of RAM! 40 MB hard disk! Only 30 lbs!). I started out with a custom AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and then moved into programming in GW-BASIC after a friend of my parents gave me a manual and encouraged me to poke around.<p>Later, I migrated to BASCOM and then QBbasic. Then I pretty much stopped programming completely after high school until I started again, more or less by accident, around 1999 when my boss asked if anyone knew how to make a web page. I thought, ""How hard can it be?"" and that became my gateway back into programming.<p>I started programming web applications in Classic ASP. I was somewhat astonished to see that the programming language was VBScript, which looked an awful lot like QBbasic with a few objects bolted on. Once Classic ASP was deprecated for .Net, I jumped over to Python as part of a more general move away from the Microsoft platform onto Linux.",1333366525

This is <i>not</i> what ""falsifiable"" means.<p>Falsifiability is the property that states, there exists some hypothetical evidence which would be accepted as conclusive disproof of the theory. For instance, newton's third law (""equal and opposite"") can be falsified by the discovery of a method of applying force which avoids any opposite application.<p>Extrapolating some, we can see that for all falsifiable theories, there is an extensive class of evidence which doesn't quite prove the theory wrong, but does weigh against the theory. Non-falsifiable theories don't have this property - for any method of assigning a probability of correctness to a non-falsifiable theory, there is a positive number below which that probability cannot go.<p>The reason the giant-collision theory should not be said to be ""proven"" incorrect is that it has not been. Its probability of correctness is still non-zero (and significant). However, it's not true that scientific theories cannot be ""proven"" incorrect - classical mechanics has been, for instance.",1333366319

Well, fast forward to about 8 months ago I came up with an idea for a web-app and decided that now was the perfect time to become good at programming.  For about 2 months straight I spent at least 3 hours every day following tutorials and tried to create little algorithms in PHP (sort an array, find largest number in an array, count the instances of a character in a string, etc...).

But the effort, I suppose, is to increase the surface area of the strengths.<p>So one of the claims of Julia is that you write code in the most natural manner, and depend on the compiler to make it fast. So, for example, the claim is that adding the optional type parameters do not necessarily make your code faster... type inference is good enough in most cases (there are obvious counterexamples, eg with global variables, but its true in the majority of cases). Also, unlike for eg. Matlab or R, vectorising your code does not necessarily produce performance gains, arrays are good enough. One of the side effects is that the standard library is implemented in the language itself, and thus extending built-in types is a breeze.<p>Therefore, I think its a very interesting effort in itself. Whether it is good enough to displace any other language is a completely separate issue. As said below, the base of useful libraries in languages such as R is phenomenal. But that should not, I think, preclude admiring a very interesting new language, for the possibilities that it hints at, if only as a highly engaging mental activity.<p>Personally, and subjectively, I think the combination of the above, and multiple dispatch, causes the language to have a highly pleasing sense of elegance.",1333365834

As an example, recent versions of Java include the compiler in Java, and therefore the classes for the AST (though undocumented). That's a DOM; you can use it to implement macros. (There's also ANTLR and BCEL to do AST twiddling - just consider them part of the standard classes of a Java variant).<p>But I think to be <i>homo-</i> (same) <i>iconic</i> (symbols), the language has to <i>be</i> those symbols. By this strict definition, it has to be a lisp. Maybe there's a looser definition possible, between a DOM and Lisp. I think a parallel lisp-syntax would do it (i.e. you can write <i>everything</i> using a lispy syntax; but there's also a friendlier syntax.<p>hmmmm, you could do this for any language, provided a AST representation (i.e. lispy) syntactically unambiguous with the rest. That <i>subset</i> of the language would then be homoiconic. e.g. add a first-class AST syntax to Java. Is that the kind of DOM you were thinking of?",1333365117

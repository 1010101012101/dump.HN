No, it means that they're assuming that you're not stupid and that you know how to read a chart. NASA very clearly labels the chart, and anyone who isn't astoundingly stupid or willfully trying to misunderstand the data can see very clearly that this chart starts at 160.",1287968699

Why not just allow anyone who wants to become licensed to do so, while charging a fee which covers the cost of the licencing process?<p>The OP's article lists the obvious dangers of completely deregulating, but it doesn't explain the cap on medallions.<p>(Please, no comments about ""because the taxi cartels control the government!"".   I understand the incentives for existing taxis to erect barriers to the market.  I'm more interesting in the rationale of those who argue that a limited number of medallions is in the public interest.)",1287968554

Taxis are one place where regulation is good. We all know what it's like to deal with a shady taxi driver. The tendency is to gouge vulnerable travelers, not to set lower prices.

I'm, uh, somewhat less good at actually getting things done on time.   I mean, I won't make stupid excuses or try to shift blame, but I am quite often late on actually getting the damn thing done because of my own personal failings, so if you just measured a willingness to accept responsibly when accepting responsibility is unpleasant, you'd think higher of me than you ought.<p>""what is the most costly (to your employer) mistake of your career?""   is a good interview question to probe the willingness to take responsibility.    I know I've made some expensive mistakes, some of my worst were simply because I typed the wrong thing out of fatigue or inattention.  (as I have grown older, I think one of the most important things I've learned is how to tell when I am likely to make a mistake, and when to log out.)<p>I'd argue that a person who claims not to have made expensive mistakes is likely the type to dodge responsibility.  (this is eminently true in the ops world.   I imagine it's true elsewhere, but I've got a lot less room to speak.)<p>You could also give them a hypothetical where, say, they could have prevented a mistake but it wasn't something they actively caused.    Then ask them if it was their responsibility.  ""If you hired a guy who did something stupid that cost us a lot of money, is it your fault or his fault?""  I'd never hire anyone for management who thought it was the hiree's fault.<p>showing up on time, in my experience has nothing to do with a willingness to take responsibility when something goes wrong.<p>As for ""gets things done"" eh, I'm not the right man to ask about that.

There are two things that separate cab service and black car service. 1) black car service drivers are not allowed to pick up passengers by street hail or any other method that is not dispatch by base station, and is booked on a private hire basis. 2) black car service is basically a private transportation in which a limo license has been granted, is suited by it's luxurious demeanor as a vehicle appropriate for ceremonies and uses of luxury or prestige.<p>The cars that UberCab dispatches are in appearance and in license compliant with black car services and are hired on-demand on a prearrangement basis through a phone application. In addition, a customer must register for the service and provide a credit card to use the service.<p>This are not random people calling a cab station, this are specific customers arranging for private transportation they could do by phone, but do so using an application instead.",1287968482

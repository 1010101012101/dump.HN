3365426,comment,3365289,3365289,19,0,jaysonelliot,,,"This really hits home for me.<p>I could have written this, except that I can already see 30 a ways back there in the rear view mirror.<p>I have just two things that I think are very important to say about this.<p>1) Don't worry about the fact that you're 30. That line about artists in their 30s or 40s is BS. There is no magical age at which you have to have produced your magnum opus. Never let the desire to ""do something great"" prevent you from doing the work. In fact, that's most likely what is keeping you FROM doing your great work. As someone who suffers from the same ""idea addiction,"" I can say that one of the reasons people like us always chase new ideas is that we are trying to have our great moment, and are always afraid that if we buckle down and commit to one of our ideas, it might not be that Great Work, and we'll end up missing the next great idea when it comes along. So, we are always looking for the Best Possible Thing, and we don't get down to the work that really has to happen.<p>2) Even superstars have to do the dishes. We hear so much about the famous artists, businessmen, inventors, musicians, whatever, but all we hear about are their glories. It's boring to talk about all the days of the long grind, just plugging away to make the donuts. For every eureka moment, there are hundreds of hours of everyday work. 
I'm 40 years old, and I've produced, in my estimation, one ""amazing art."" It's a magazine I started and ran for eight years. In retrospect, I feel like it was a non-stop party, but if I really think about it, the only reason it succeeded was that I had no choice but to slug it out and put in the 90-hour weeks of boring copy editing, ad sales, bookkeeping, etc. It's because at the time, it was the ONLY IDEA I HAD.
Now that I have dozens of ideas at any given time, ironically, I get none of them done. 
Don't try to create a Great Work. Pick something you enjoy and have fun making, and just make the hell out of it. If you're lucky, it might even be ""amazing art.""",1324166312

3365424,comment,3365052,3365200,5,0,stan_rogers,,,"Pentacene is synthesized from benzene, and the primary source for benzene is currently petroleum. It doesn't <i>have to be</i>, but benzene has always been a relatively cheap ""garbage"" byproduct of other products (first coke, then petroleum fuels). It is unlikely that over the long term extraction of fossil fuels would be a cost-efficient means of deriving chemicals that are now heavily subsidized by the primary products; bacterial synthesis would probably much more practical. That is to say one shouldn't dismiss non-fuel petrochemicals simply because the current cheapest source is petroleum -- it won't always be unless the demand for petrochemical fuels (or coal/coke) remains high. Ironically, then, things that are now petrochemicals could spell the end of the petrochemical industry if they contribute to a reduction in demand for fuel.",1324166274
3365422,comment,3364437,3365376,1,0,_dps,,,"I think ""libertarian"" is close but not quite right (unless you are coming from Chomsky's viewpoint, which is a niche within a niche, at least as far as US libertarian thinking is concerned).<p>If you take libertarianism to mean ""allow anything that is consensual and does not involve externalities"", then proprietary software as implemented today is totally fine. The user consents to an agreement that amounts to ""I'll give you the output of my compiler, but I'm not going to give you the input. Also, you have to promise not to redistribute it.""<p>Of course, setting up the details of that arrangement for every creative work would be a huge hassle, and copyright is an attempt (in my opinion a failed one) to streamline it. One way to envision copyright in a libertarian framework is a legal presupposition that when I tell you a ""creative secret"" (copyrighted work), you'll keep it secret (won't redistribute) unless I give you explicit permission (a license).<p>*Edit: to elaborate on why I think copyright is a failed streamlining of the above framework, I'll just give one example. If I broadcast my ""creative secret"" out loud (or over the EM spectrum) then I can't reasonably expect it to be secret. The people who listen to it and hear my ""secret"" have never formed a consensual agreement with me. Thus, copyright as it stands gets twisted into ""you can't participate in public communications without promising to pretend that various things you hear are owned secrets""",1324166240

The problem is that the skirt/pants idea doesn't make for much of an interesting discussion.<p>I think this comes down to two problems with your wording (and having English as my second language, I had to rely on taking your words by their default meaning): One, the use of dress vs. skirt that we have cleared up and Two, the difference between ""message about sexual availability"" and ""have their sexuality judged"".<p>That's why I initially thought you were making a joke (I found it quite funny, actually) - the difference between those two is simply too great to be making a point. Women in a skirt are judged for whether or not that dresses them to be attractive. Men in a skirt are judged for whether or not they are men at all. A man wearing pants may be judged for how attractive the specific pair of pants makes him, but a woman in pants is judged for that AND for how much it makes her appear to try to be ""more manly"".<p>To sum this up - I think you were wrong implying that women are not being judged, sexually, in pants. Furthermore, the man in a skirt point doesn't hold that much value and has only little to do with that and with what you were originally commenting on - the external judgment of sexual availability.<p>P.S.: As for the absurdity of a cleavage being essential for a dress - it may be debatable to what extend that point really carries, but it is a fact that a dress (again, very specific, check the wiki) is specifically cut to the female anatomy, allowing for unique features of a woman (narrower hips, cleavage).

If I am, I am very flattered that something I said got you thinking along those lines.<p>However I'd argue with you about Apple. Like you said, Apple didn't hit the time-frame requirement. Wouldn't you also agree that a true startup needs to have the requirements you listed but at the same time start from zero. Companies that just start out, have the growth you talk about in the time frame you talk about would definitely be startups. Companies that have been around for a while and suddenly have explosive growth and hit the other requirements only resemble startups. Google, Apple, and Facebook <i>feel</i> like startups but have certainly grown out of that phase. Being a startup in my opinion a one-time phase that you cannot go through again once you're established no matter how explosive your growth is.<p>In any case I like your definition and I think it's important that we have one.

(Apologies for not trying to reproduce the breathless style of headline.) As is common, the article presupposes that decentralization is unambiguously progress, but that isn't true in all respects.<p>People often complain about the idea of using version control for large binary files, as if it is unreasonable to want such a thing, and that as a point of principle version control systems should contain only text files, and the fact that many version control systems support this poorly is proof that you don't want it anyway. But there are actually people who create, with their own hands, large binary files, often of the completely-unmergeable variety, and they deserve version control just as much as the programmers do.<p>(And then once you have a system that works well for them, you can then use it to solve all manner of problems that might previously have involved storing files in public folders, mailing them round, or maybe just waiting for them to compile again. No need for any of that crap any more - just check the files in, they're there forever, and you can get them back quickly.)",1324163882

Are ISPs required to check if people are trying and/or keep lists of who tried to access certain servers?<p>* Does it have any legal sledgehammer to use against people who access the same info over a VPN or TOR, or is that just way over their heads?<p>Finally: What's to stop someone from putting out a daily/constantly updated and diffed hosts file, that people can automatically download, to let them easily access any site they want to?<p>[edited for readability]",1324163222

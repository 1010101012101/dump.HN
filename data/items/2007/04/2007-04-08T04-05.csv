Or, to stay with MS, you could use a hidden IFRAME.<p>Really no rocket science... so, the killer apps these days are small, simple and FAST desktop apps (whatever desktop people use). We will see...

But it still a good solution if using a DB is an overkill.<p>I believe there's a Prevayler port for Ruby.<p>

Great find!<p>Here's a personal account of ball of mud code: <p>(from my comment on <a href=""http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2007/04/07/how-to-wreck-your-brand/"">http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2007/04/07/how-to-wreck-your-brand/</a> )<p>I worked with them [Sony] on the development of their <a href=""http://musicstore.connect.com/"">http://musicstore.connect.com/</a> site that was their attempted 'iTunes Store killer' (just saying that makes me chuckle). Wow, what a mess. Talk about spaghetti code that had mushroomed into a giant ball of mud. It was <i>way</i> over budget and took much longer than anyone anticipated. And a year later, it still only supports Internet Explorer and Windows.<p>My take on what went wrong in this instance: they did not manage complexity.<p>They let it grow and grow and did not believe that 'code debt' was a reality. It soon took 10 times longer to make even the simplest changes because of the very poor state of the code.<p>I have seen this happen at several companies and it's usually the same story. There are B and C level coders that don't understand the dangers or code complexity or code debt and thus create loads of both. The A level coders that do understand this try to explain the growing problem to management. The management doesn't know any better, so they see code cleanup as a needless expense that will only slow down rolling out new features and so they side with the B and C level coders. Of course, the irony is that development will eventually crawl to a near halt because the code is undecipherable. Along the way the A level coders get so frustrated with the state of the code base that they leave the company for greener pastures. This is the critical turning point since the B and C level coders will only hire other B and C level coders - and the project will die a slow death as the cycle continues.",1176006949

Did they improve that? NO. That shows 0 creativity or understanding of things. Only thing MSFT is good at is putting nice colors and popping things here and there and calling it cool tech. Inane people dont see that for this cool thing they are putting pressure on hardware, RAM guzzler cool things eh?",1176006552

Microsoft has a huge partner network of over 80,000 companies who enjoy working with Microsoft.""<p>Eh.  I personally didn't enjoy working with Microsoft.  Strange mix of arrogance and mediocrity.

Think about it -- how often do you buy a Microsoft product directly from Microsoft?  Never?  You always buy it through someone else, through the ""channel"" -- which might be a reseller, a var, or an oem.  This disconnection from the customer is killing microsoft in the NEW world...

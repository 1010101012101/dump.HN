How about:<p>o increasing funding for monitoring temperatures on a worldwide basis so that we can get a better handle on where we are.<p>o increasing funding for monitoring CO2 levels (along with other greenhouse gases) to see if can get more data about the here and now.<p>Certainly we will need better monitoring of both temperature and CO2 gases to understand where we are and to monitor the effectiveness of any interventions that are agreed to.<p>It's often more effective to work from areas where you may agree and to tell if you are having a values conflict or a disagreement over facts and competing hypotheses for explaining them.<p>Another way to look at this would be to ask ""what would prove to you the reality of both global warming and C02 as it's cause?""

Main reason is that the barrier to entry is extremely high.  Without tutorials, and the way the ui is setup, it requires you to be a former civ player, and a former civ player likely has civ on their computer (or at one point).  So with the free advantage gone for a lot of them (eg i have civ4 installed right now), how is this better than multiplayer civ4?  my hope is that u have some cool plans for it that takes it beyond the commercial civ titles.",1261273453

1005551,comment,1005238,1005311,0,0,unalone,,,"That flies in the face of conventional thinking, which says ideas are cheap and delivery is everything. Unless conceptually you've figured out such an enormous breakthrough that the solution is literally in your hands right now, you have no competitive edge over anybody, and you're working with a concept simplistic enough a thirteen-year-old could understand it. That's not a good thing, if the concept's all you've got. It means the thirteen-year-olds at Google and Skype have figured it out too.<p>But you're adept at saying very simple and ugly things with enough words that it sounds almost swallowable. I had to reread what you posted twice to make out what you were saying. Basically, you're admitting that Skype has an alternative that's cheaper and more effective, and that it works perfectly save phone companies don't like it. Your solution is to price gouge the same way phone companies are right now so that people will be tricked into thinking there's a profit. But phrased like that, it sounds more like a concept without an idea, artificially priced at a level beyond its actual value.<p>I wish you luck not for Avecora but for whatever idea you have after this. The best way to learn quickly is to pursue a wild, failing ambition. Two years from now, if you've learned, you'll have a savvy that's the envy of your peers. Just make sure that for the time being, you're enjoying your work. Then failure really doesn't matter.",1261273189

That, too, is an interesting information-theoretic problem.<p><i>""That would be interesting if they weren't using so poor an approach.""</i><p>You missed the forest for the trees. In case you didn't notice, the people who wrote the paper are electrical engineers. They used the information-theoretic approach that is used in communications theory to a problem outside the traditional scope of application of the theory. Sure, natural language is hard, but if you start your research by focusing on all the little details you will get nowhere. To me, the paper looks like a first shot at a difficult problem. If you can do better, I would love to hear about it.<p><i>""...it sounds like the parameters of the study were determined by someone with very little understanding of how ASL actually works.""</i><p>That is not the point.

So how do the Japanese communicate as effectively as we do?'<p>I speak some Japanese. Japanese is actually a bit harder to communicate in than most other languages. The emphasis on social unity and modesty has evolved to make the language incredibly nuanced and complex. Nowadays, there's some factual statements that are almost literally impossible to say in Japanese because the words/phrases/grammar to say them don't match up.<p>Feynman touched on this in ""Surely You're Joking"" - there's different verbs for the exact same action based on the social situation and how well respected the person you're talking to is. So if you want someone to look at your garden, you say something like, ""Would you please take-a-pasing-glance at my barely suitable garden?"" But if you want to look at someone else's garden, you might say, ""May I look-with-admiration upon you're beautiful garden?"" If it's an official figure or a temple, it'd be something like, ""May I quickly-glance-my-eyes-over-reverently on your most majestic of gardens?""<p>Different verbs. All mean ""view"" - but with different levels of politeness and appropriateness. One of the HNers who lives in Japan could probably comment more, I haven't spent all that much time there.

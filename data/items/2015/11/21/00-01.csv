After all, that&#x27;s why you hire and delegate to managers in the first place.<p>What this really means is, no acquisitions for Facebook once leave starts (except maybe the ones he&#x27;s already greenlit). At the CEO level, you focus on direction, strategy, and top-level execution of said direction and strategy. You&#x27;re not designing and doing grunt work. If anyone can step back from a large corporation and watch things keep on humming along, it&#x27;s the CEO.",1448067592

Currently I am using iPhoto with iCloud and my wife and I have to have seperate accounts in order to have files automatically save to the cloud. Which isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. I just uploaded the 5G of photos she had on her phone to my computer so  that I could free up enough space to upgrade her phone to iOS9. I then logged into iCloud.com using her credetials and started uploading everything into iPhoto. But wait: only the JPG files will upload. Why can&#x27;t I upload .MOV or .PNG?<p>Dropbox won&#x27;t work because I can&#x27;t do any type of a family sharing type thing and I don&#x27;t want to have to pay for two pro accounts and have each one use 5 Gig. The other problem is that I want my cloud to save the originals in the cloud and have the client store low res photos and dynamically load the high res when I am browsing or request for the original (similar to iPhoto).<p>Does anyone know of a good photo cloud solution? Or am I going to have to spend a week building my own?",1448066402

Wouldn&#x27;t such disclosure jeopardize ongoing operations? The NSA has no obligation to reveal anything more about its operations than federal law requires it to. The legislative branch has the responsibility of enforcing any requirements placed upon the NSA.<p>The legislative branch is responsible for checking the power of the executive branch, which includes the NSA. That is why congress regulates its operations, and enforces the regulations with specialized committees.<p>Unfortunately, even if congress can tightly regulate the NSA, it cannot publicly enforce its regulations. Public enforcement would jeopardize ongoing operations within the NSA. If Congress limited its regulations to only those that it could publicly enforce, then it would restrict the scope of the regulations, making it impossible to properly check the power of the NSA.<p>Given the catch-22 of asking congress to regulate the NSA, but in a publicly provable manner, we are left with two choices: sacrifice the intelligence apparatus altogether, or continue funding it while trusting the regulatory power of congress.<p>Ultimately the power of the NSA depends on the power of its overseers on the intelligence committee. A powerful group of senators and congressmen could enforce regulations on the NSA.<p>The challenge is finding trustworthy congressmen, who are capable of regulating the NSA. Americans should really stop worrying about the behavior of the NSA, and start worrying about electing the right congressmen to ensure the NSA is operating for the best interest of the American people.",1448066185

It could also warn you (or someone else) if you did not take your prescriptions on time or if you were running low on something necessary.

10604721,comment,10598766,10604523,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Oh, where to start!<p>So Asana is a todo list. Everything is a task. Tasks are assigned. Tasks can have subtasks. They can also have comments, tags and attachments. The top-level organizing construct is the project; projects have tasks and also team members. Oh, and within a project, tasks have order (something which doesn&#x27;t really work in practice).<p>So far so good. Most of the problem with Asana is in the UI. Asana is all about lists. Unlike Trello, for example, Asana only has one view: A vertical list of tasks. This list UI is very much like a classic outliner or even text editor, in that there&#x27;s almost always a cursor that&#x27;s editing something. You can use the keyboard to navigate around. This leads to some immediate weaknesses: Since there&#x27;s usually a cursor, typing something will typically have the text land in some random, unpredictable place. Hitting Enter creates an empty task. So if you&#x27;re not super careful, your lists will be littered with errand characters and empty tasks.<p>This information-dense view means there is never a place to &quot;rest&quot;. I can&#x27;t keep a single task open. There&#x27;s a split screen that allows you to maximize a task, but it&#x27;s not quite the same. So in Asana, you never feel like you&#x27;re in a specific location. It&#x27;s always the list. It&#x27;s easy to get lost because there&#x27;s little or no sense of hiearchy, even though the data model is hiearchical. This UI is doubly problematic because Asana is a heavy single-page app (it takes several seconds for it to &quot;boot&quot;) that doesn&#x27;t lend itself to being opened up in multiple tabs. So it&#x27;s not very web-app-like.<p>Really, this kind of editor-like &quot;live&quot; UI seems more appropriate for personal todo lists, but not for collaborative ones. In my mind, a task is a kind of mini project, and a task with subtasks is a <i>bigger</i> kind of mini project (usually you use these for multi-step tasks like launches or big features), but Asana treats them all with equal lightweightness. In fact, in your &quot;My Tasks&quot; view (also a list), Asana will comingle subtasks and top-level tasks, making it confusing because subtasks don&#x27;t carry their context with them — so &quot;My Tasks&quot; will list something like &quot;Add CNAME&quot;, which on its own makes no sense, until you click on it and see that it&#x27;s a subtask of &quot;superproduct.com launch&quot;.<p>There are lots of minor flaws. The editor is horrible — pasting and undo/redo tend to make the cursor lose its place, there&#x27;s basically no support for pasting code (no syntax highlighting), the keyboard shortcuts are non-standard and weird (they use tab (!) instead of alt or ctrl as a modifier), and you can&#x27;t turn off the stupid rich text mode (no Markdown). As mentioned, startup time is bad, and the main page loads as a POST, so if you restart the browser, the browser needs to ask if you &quot;want to submit this form&quot;, which is bizarre.<p>The more I talk about, the less I like it. Unfortunately, so far I haven&#x27;t found any alternatives that look good enough to migrate.",1448064203

It would be cool to think people here know who these guys are.)  In any case, the original point remains: even on Hacker News, Marie Curie is far better-known than Lev Landau, and it's not because she was the greater scientist.",1210740342

It does not fit the general ""decline of the news"" theme, and for a good reason -- it's a great product. It is getting harder and harder to sell bad products, convenient delivery is no longer sufficient for success.",1210740325

189265,comment,189260,189260,0,0,kyro,,,"I had the same question about a year back, and I'm sure some of you will remember it. I saw myself as the 'business major [I don't have a major] who loved the web and had a good idea about a web based business.' And there's one thing I found out through posting on web bulletins, posting flyers around school, and trying to network - it's extremely difficult to find a hacker cofounder who is willing to jump on board. How could I, a non-hacker, possibly play an equal contributory role has my hacker cofounder? And furthermor, how could I accurately convey my ideas coming from a frame of mind completely different from that of a hacker? I realized that if any sort of relationship was forged for the sake of having a team, these issues would soon arise in the future and cause much bigger problems, and would ultimately hinder the success and growth of a startup. So I started to learn how to hack, and it literally changed the way I think about ideas. I try to conceptualize how I can tackle problems with code, and how feasible it'd be to do so. And it's this newly found understanding that will help me play a more integral role in my team, and allow me to communicate with hacker cofounders on a leveled playing field. Even two of the Auctomatic founders eventually learned how to hack.<p>At the beginning, I was irritated by the response I got here. People told me left and right that business people are useless and that if you don't know how to hack you can't go anywhere. But, after getting my feet wet and thinking about it, I understand where they were coming from.<p>So I guess a business guy can in fact lead a successful startup. But do I think that business savvy guy who knows a bit about hacking will have significantly higher chances of succeeding in the web world? Yes.",1210740082

Can the business major who loves the web and has a good idea about a web based business succeed in the cut throat, competition heavy web space?

The problem that I could surmise from their actions and meetings they posted was that they knew what they needed to do but were reluctant to do it.<p>They refused to work within the tech community and just tried to attract anyone who had an idea. Instead of going for the people who could execute and have ideas anyway and promoting the ""contracting + equity"" aspect of the ventures, they wanted to have a hand in every project.<p>Also, they seemed to have a clear strategy, but just not follow it. They were always hiring, when it probably would have been more prudent to contract out and actually<p>building the site that was supposed to make them special.<p>They were always hiring, but no one could figure out why they weren't improving the site like the community wanted. No one could figure out why they looked so busy on the videos, but nothing was ever completed.",1210739027

Especially since this is now happening all over the place.<p>I know how it feels like. I&#x27;m a Romanian and I felt powerless countless of times, especially in recent years when the local lefties have been on a power grabbing race, with countless of abuses and bad decisions, also leaving a hole in our budget due to electoral alms, but lo and behold, they&#x27;ve lost the presidential race by a brutal margin, even though they were the winners of all polls and they also control the media. What happened is that a large percentage of people that never voted showed up this time. People called their families, people talked on Facebook, people took it to the streets. Just like the protests from a year and a half ago that stopped a corrupted and damaging gold mining project. I&#x27;m telling you, it works - and btw, mass-media is in general corrupted, which is why the Internet is such a disruptive force.",1417805974

He wanted to potentially hire me as a freelancer to help him with the graphics side of a little game he was working on.  He explained what he wanted done, and at the end of it I was left feeling like &quot;This is so easy it would be wrong of me to exploit this guy like this.&quot;  I didn&#x27;t phrase it quite like that, but I said something along the lines of &quot;Okay, so at this point, most people would take your money and do the project.  But I feel like I should do you a favor and not do that, because this is actually not a hard problem.  Here&#x27;s some tutorials that are pretty much exactly what you&#x27;re asking: x, y, z&quot;<p>Next thing I see, he&#x27;s disconnected from chat and never said another word to me.<p>The lesson for me (besides that I&#x27;m an idiot for not taking the money) is that the amount of value you think you&#x27;re providing is almost always wildly different from the actual value you&#x27;re providing.

I think at Thumbtack we blocked all AWS IPs, a good deal of foreign IPs, in addition to the specific IPs of people who were abusively crawling.<p>At the same time, the onus shouldn&#x27;t be on QVC to have to block this, result.ly should either be a good citizen or have to face a lawsuit.

Pursuing my interests? As a PhD student you get to choose some interesting problem and work on that, right? That&#x27;s what I naively imagined before I started at the institute. Some day at lunch I told my supervisor about this idea I had. We could take his fluid simulation method from computer graphics and apply it to a problem related to molten polymers. There was this experiment by a group of applied physicists that would fit nicely. He asked me how many people would be interested in the problem. Maybe a handful, I said. And then I realized that there was no way I could work on that problem. Success in academia is measured in the number of citations your paper receives. What point is there in writing a paper that is only interesting to such a small audience? To be successful you need to target a large audience, and not just pursue whatever obscure problem takes your fancy.<p>If you aren&#x27;t paid well, and you&#x27;re not well respected, and there is no great job waiting for you at the end of the tunnel, and you can&#x27;t even work on what you&#x27;re most interested in, I can&#x27;t really blame anybody for leaving.",1417805653

This was a good deal for me, and a bad deal for PG&E apparently.

But ask yourself: &quot;Does the client I&#x27;m working for have the capability to hire someone full-time for the service I&#x27;m providing? Would they know how? Would they be able to attract the right talent? And: would it make any business sense for them to do that?&quot; If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then please, think of it this way: <i>no more than 50% of the value you&#x27;re providing comes from actual code</i>; the remainder is business value you create by being available to solve a problem for your client in the precise scheduling and format they need.<p>When you grok this, you see why your rate has nothing at all to do with full-time salary for a comparable tech position. No full-timer can do what you&#x27;re doing. By definition. Because they&#x27;re only available full-time.<p>Also: please, for the love of all that&#x27;s holy, don&#x27;t bill hourly.

The outdated &quot;privileged ports&quot; restriction means that most services must run or at least by started by root, making the OS effectively single-tenant by default. Simply removing that legacy cruft would improve the situation a lot. There&#x27;s also no way to assign IPs or network interfaces to users. Network interfaces should have uid/gid and permissions like files, and a user should have a default interface. (Sharing of course would be possible.) Firewall rules (e.g. iptables) should also be per-user as well as global.<p>Another major weakness is libraries. DLLs should be implemented using either per-user or even better with cryptographically secure content-addressable lookup of binary objects. This would allow the OS to cache symbols globally but in a secure way. The whole binary/DLL paradigm is outdated and needs a modern rethink.<p>Software installation is broken.

What if I have a type called SanitizedString or OracleString? What about character arrays retrieved from C ABI calls?<p>And even if 3. is true, you are encoding implementation details in your interface. If you need to optimize your type later to use a trie, you&#x27;ll have to do extra allocations and copies after all.<p>My point is that interfaces should require what they need: a character sequence if they need a character sequence and a character buffer if they need a character buffer. Hence my comment about std::string being more appropriately named std::string_buffer.<p>Even string_ref isn&#x27;t perfect because it assumes your sequence is in contiguous memory. I&#x27;m hoping developments in the C++ language and standard library comes up with a good answer to that problem, perhaps one that leverages the concepts proposals. But even a concepts-based solution will have drawbacks, such as requiring even more code to go in your header file.",1417803739

That thread doesn&#x27;t need any JS-level synchronization because it has nothing to do with JS. Furthermore, you can kick off multiple requests like this in parallel.<p>When a request is done and has data to pass back, the external thread will queue up a V8 event. When V8 is free and is ready for the next event, it will see the finished request and trigger your callback with the data.

He was extremely excited, to the point that he was able to sit still for a half-hour just listening to the announcements of various system checks. Even without being able to watch the actual launch live (we watched a taped version a few minutes later), he still seemed to be catching quite a bit of excitement, and asked a myriad of questions (&quot;How does the rocket return to earth?&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s that flame?&quot;).<p>When I was in grade-school in the early-mid 90&#x27;s, I brought a news clipping of a Shuttle launch in for a &quot;current events&quot; classroom segment. Many of my classmates responded with disinterest: &quot;Why do you care? There are Shuttle launches all the time.&quot; We were young enough not to remember Challenger, so space-flight seemed routine and boring. As tragic and disappointing as the Columbia disaster and end of the Shuttle program were, I think they actually reminded us not to take manned spaceflight for granted.<p>I work with an astronomer and physicist with a PhD from MIT. She was actually less excited about today&#x27;s launch than I expected, mainly because she&#x27;s more interested in the science being done by robotic missions. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s right that they&#x27;re much more cost-effective and able to deliver almost as many results, but I&#x27;d place a small wager that manned spaceflight was at least partially responsible for her interests and career path.<p>Also, I realized this morning (while looking at diagrams comparing the sizes of various launch configurations) that just seeing a picture of a Space Shuttle with its rockets still makes me a bit emotional. I can&#x27;t say for sure what effect it had on me growing up, but I&#x27;m sure that it played a part in my development as a civic- and tech-minded individual.",1417803708

I&#x27;d like to enlighten why choosing a license is important.<p>Many people can be picky about the license, because even though you may be full of good intentions, the data you provide is non-free as-is in that it can&#x27;t be reused elsewhere. Having a license is the clean, boring way to tell everyone &quot;do whatever you want with this data&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s even a problem for Github, or more precisely Github users, because many people push some code without any explicit license, making this code hardly usable by default: it may be available but you don&#x27;t know if you have the right to reuse it, even if the developer said &quot;yeah, use this as you want&quot;. That&#x27;s not enough. Just because the developer didn&#x27;t take a few minutes to select and put a LICENSE file.<p>It is also important to think about it in the other direction: If you&#x27;re going to take content from Wookieepedia, their license is CC-BY-SA (<a href=""http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:Copyrights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:Copyrights</a>), which means that you MUST say it comes (at least partially) from them (not that you wouldn&#x27;t anyway) and that you MUST redistribute your content with a &quot;similar&quot; license. Even though you may think that everything is fine, there are some actions to do on this side.<p>Now, I&#x27;d understand that if only &quot;amateurs&quot; come and play with the data, we&#x27;re all among good behaving adults and all is fine. But you may not be able to predict what will happen with how data is used, so unfortunately this step is important.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t like restricting people, so I try to use CC0 as much as possible. Be aware that Creative Commons licenses may not be best suited for data (they were designed for work of art primarily), as can be seen by OSM&#x27;s decision on the matter (<a href=""http://www.osmfoundation.org/wiki/License/We_Are_Changing_The_License"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osmfoundation.org/wiki/License/We_Are_Changing_Th...</a>) so you may want to avoid them.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not even talking about money, which is an orthogonal problem.",1417802977

Take a look at how Python 2.5 handles generators; yield is an expression, and then the external interface to a generator is a stream with a send() method you can use to resume the generator.  (As another poster pointed out, a stream is a much more precise description of the abstraction than an array - arrays support constant-time random access, while streams are just ordered collections of elements.)<p>I do think that combining futures/promises with generators gives a much cleaner programming model.  Take a look at how Python 3.4 handles generators & async programming; here a generator is implicitly a Future, and &#x27;yield from&#x27; runs a future to completion, letting you compose coroutines regardless of how many yield points they have.<p>But my point is that these are all programming <i>models</i>, different ways to present the underlying abstraction to programmers.  It&#x27;s silly to talk about &quot;the fact that coroutines require...&quot; or &quot;generators <i>need</i> promises&quot; or &quot;pretending that...&quot;, as if there were only one way to do async programming - these are not universal abstractions, they are models to present the underlying scheduler to programmers, and we choose between them based on how convenient they are to programmers.",1417802564

It&#x27;s a tool that solves problems fast and cheap. It&#x27;s not for every application but it  fits for some VERY well. And most of PHP&#x27;s problems are the newb programmers it attracts, just like JavaScript. The language itself has tons of quirks but you can write good PHP just as well as anything else, and you can solve certain problems very fast with it.",1417802502

I have seen many, many, DOS attacks from IRC bots to Ukrainian web scrapers to Chinese get-lucky wordpress exploit scanners. Most of these can be ignored and blocked with little effort.<p>By FAR the most annoying of any of these is when Google, Bing and/or Yahoo decide to wake up and crawl your infrastructure with little regard to your robots.txt or webmaster settings, if available. I think they have got better in recent years, but they used to be the absolute worst. It came down to: Let us DOS you, or have your ranking suffer. Suing Google, Bing, Yahoo isn&#x27;t exactly an option.<p>Some context: I was the lead architect/engineer combo for a CMS that hosted ~500k domains for a fairly large international company. Some days I could login and see them crawling every domain from A-Z. Some days I would get caught by Google and Bing at the same time. They were the largest consumers of data on this system.",1417802426
8705810,comment,8705216,8705714,0,0,abakker,,,"I would point out that most ROI models for solar look so good because of very generous subsidies. If subsidies aren&#x27;t counted, the ROI time is not nearly so good.<p>Additionally, the  Total Cost of Ownership of Solar will be higher in areas where panels/solar systems are prone to damage from weather etc. Wind, Rain, Snow, freeze/thaw, dust can all damage solar arrays, or negatively impact their performance.<p>If there are batteries involved, those will likely also need to be replaced before the system has initially paid itself off. Even if batteries get cheaper and better every year, the disposal fees for old batteries and their current inability to deal with house-sized loads well can easily add significant cost.<p>I don&#x27;t want this to sound like I am anti-solar. I am a big proponent of solar, but there are many problems with the current system. It is a somewhat unfair comparison no matter what, since the energy we buy from fossil fuel generation does not accurately reflect the cost of the pollution it makes or the environmental harm it does.",1417802417

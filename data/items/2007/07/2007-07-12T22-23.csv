Recursive queries are generally a no-no, as they drag your performance down fairly quickly.  Selecting based on the newsid gives you every single comment on the item, and then you'll have to do a lot of work (basically building up the full tree structure in memory) to find out which are children.  For a site with traffic like news.yc, it's probably acceptable, but it's still more complicated to code than a simple select.",1184279349
33922,comment,33919,33919,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"My first reaction is that the word is elegant but with 4 syllables is a lot to ask.  It seems like the most successful names are simple with fewer syllables making it easy to remember.<p>For the logo, there is a visual conflict between the abstracted lines of text and the ""study stickies"".  Maybe if you choose either just the lines or the letters that would help, or you could differentiate the two more with thinner abstract text and thicker font lettering.  For the small version, you could just use the open book look with an abbreviation of your name.  We did a similar thing at <a href=""http://www.streamfocus.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.streamfocus.com</a>  (see the little logo in the address bar)",1184279346
33921,comment,33886,33886,0,0,Alex3917,,,"On the topic of community makeup, here are some interesting findings that come from Yahoo's social scientists (using Yahoo lists as the dataset):<p>1) Small groups have higher numbers of core users<p>2) Private and semi-public groups have higher numbers of core users than public groups<p>3) People in private groups remain in the core for longer<p>4) A user who is in the core of one group is more likely to become a member of the core when joining another group<p>5) New members who eventually become part of the core are more likely to receive messages from other users who have been long-time core users<p>6) New members who eventually become light users are more likely to receive messages from other light users, if they receive replies at all.<p>This suggests some strategies for building a strong group of core users to transmit social norms. For example, having an idea of who the core users are in other similar communities and making a special effort to reach out to them if they visit your site.<p>Unhappily I lost the original paper and all I have are my notes, so I don't know exactly how they defined the core users offhand.

33920,comment,33886,33902,0,0,vlad,,,"Why not just store the parentid (can be another comment or the news topic), username (instead of userid so you don't have to access the users table), and votecount for each comment?<p>Also, each comment should have a newsid field that points to the original newstopic.  The left-most posts would have the parentid and newsid that were the same (or parentid can be zero, depending on how you do it).  But any replies would have the parentid to the parent comment, but the newsid would still point to the newstopic.  Then you just run an SQL query to find all comments with the newsid for that newstopic.  You won't have to join any tables.  After that, with everything in memory, you can just sort the way it has to be.  Finally, you can cache the page in memory or a file in case the page doesn't change for the next set of visitors.",1184278633

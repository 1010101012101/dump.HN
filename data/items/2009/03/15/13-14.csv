Something tells me that this cultural inclination for drug usage makes it much more difficult to justify legalization.  We're a country that can barely handle a free-market debt system -- I don't even want to know what we would do with a liberalized drug market.<p>Then again, I am one of those people who doesn't do drugs, drink, smoke, or eat processed foods, because I understand that it's extremely expensive (in that you lose long-term quality of life / life expectancy - the single most important non-renewable resource for a living creature); I am obviously a minority...",1237125323

516811,comment,516678,516790,0,0,usuallyuselss,,,"> The assumption most people seem to base their conclusions on is that making drugs illegal reduces consumption. All empirical evidence so far - even from less biased sources than the wildly free-market Cato institute - shows that this is not the case. In countries where more drugs are legal, consumption actually goes down.<p>We have empirical evidence on cannabis, true. In that case (Netherlands) statistics say that ""everything is roughly better"", but differences are so small that it's difficult to say it's due to the drug laws.<p>We do not have empirical evidence on drugs that make you physically and/or psychologically addicted after one shot.<p>And there should be no toying with this. Getting of cannabis after years of using it is a piece of cake compared to getting of heroin after less than five shots. It's a totally different story.",1237123979

It got distracting.<p>One of the harder things to do in a large company when introducing agile is to get people back to the whiteboard. Large non-agile teams are so used to having their own electronic tools and document templates that when you ask them to work ""without a crutch""? It's like speaking in Klingon.",1237123879
516808,comment,516162,516162,0,0,yason,,,"There's the thing between how good you think you are and how good you are when compared to others.<p>To be honest if you're any smart you will, no matter what, eventually realise that you're actually pretty bad. There's so much you don't know yet and lots and lots of things that bug you because you know you could have done better! This will keep you on toes which in turn makes you better than others. Conversely, it'll be quite a shock to a smart person to realise that others really aren't that smart, far from it.<p>This phenomenon has actually been studied: after doing some tests good students tend to think they did bad and assume that everyone else is at least on the same level, while bad students tend to think that they're actually pretty good and then assume that most other people must have done it worse.",1237123876
516807,comment,516276,516764,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"To my understanding: When git looks for changes it scans all the tracked files (checking timestamps before hashing) and hashing those that look changed. Commits generate patches for all changed files, then generate hashes for each file, then hash the set of files in each directory for a hash of the directory, repeated until the state of the entire repository is collected into one hash. This is normally pretty fast, and has a lot of advantages as a way to represent state changes in the project, but it also means that if the project has several huge binary files sitting about (or thousands of large binaries, etc.), it will have to hash them as well. This requires a full pass through the file any time that they look like they might have changed, new files are added, etc. (Mercurial works very similarly, though the internal data structures are different.) Running sha1 on a 342M file just took about 9 seconds on my computer; this goes up linearly with file size.<p>Git deals with the state of the tree <i>as a whole</i>, while Perforce, Subversion, and some others work at a <i>file-by-file level</i>, so they only need to scan the huge files when adding them, doing comparisons for updates, etc. (Updating or scanning for changes on perforce or subversion <i>does</i> scan the whole tree, though, which can be very slow.)<p>You can make git ignore the binary files via .gitignore, of course, and then they won't slow source tracking down anymore. You need to use something else to keep them in sync, though. (Rysnc works well for me. Unison is supposed to be good for this, as well.) You can still track the file metadata, such as a checksum and a path to fetch it from automatically, in a text file in git. It won't be able to do merges on the binaries, but how often do you merge binaries?",1237123863
516806,comment,516215,516712,0,0,jyu,,,"Most people buy with their emotions, and use logic to justify the purchase. To maximize the number of people that get into that emotional buying state, you give out sales info in several different ways to cover most readers.<p>For something like a $79.95 ebook on parrot training, it would probably take you a fair amount of convincing to buy. That's why they give you a long list of reasons in storytelling format. If it were free, you would need less convincing, and the copy would be drastically shorter.",1237123854

Here's mine, which has worked pretty decently the last few years for me:<p>Japan and America trade about $200 billion a year with each other.  Roughly half of that is technology which didn't exist in 1950.  Less than one American engineer in 10,000 speaks Japanese.  You're looking at one of them.  Were you happy with how your last US/Japan programming project turned out?<p>I wouldn't call it a superpower -- just enough to get people to remember why they have my business card in their folder.  They're almost always asking right after they come to a pain point for lack of a bilingual engineer and the great thing about the pitch is it means I've got excellent odds of being the only responsive hit in their business card book.<p>(Sidenote: business cards.

516793,comment,516276,516612,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I'm a different person from jrockway, but my position is while git <i>alone</i> does not scale when tracking with very large binaries, it's an easily solved problem, as it is intentionally designed to work with other tools better suited to such tasks. Git + rysnc solves that problem for me in full, and should scale fine.<p>Git doesn't include a source code editor, profiler, or web browser, either. The Unix way of design involves the creation of independent programs that intercommunicate via files and/or pipes. The individual programs themselves can be small and simple due to not trying to solve several different problems at once, and since they communicate via buffered pipes, you get Erlang-style message-passing parallelism for free at the OS level.<p>Like I said, if you track the binary metadata (checksums and paths to fetch them from) in git but not the files themselves, your scaling problem goes away completely. If you have a personal problem with using more than one program jointly, that has nothing to do with git.",1237122105

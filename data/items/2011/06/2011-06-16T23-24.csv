2663768,comment,2657745,2660763,3,0,drivebyacct2,,,"You described the reasons I stuck with my own psuedo ActiveRecord on top of NHibernate's basic Transaction and Session support. It's called ""unit of work"" and it makes much more sense to me. We're very specific (for simplicity and sanity) that all HTTP operations to our webapp are autonomous (from the user perspective) and stateless. No multipaged forms, etc.<p>So every request is given a session and whatever needs to happen as a result of that request is encapsulated in that session. If something goes wrong, that transaction in that session can be reverted. If NHibernate determines that it needs data modified early in the session for something later in the transaction, it handles it behind the scenes. Then an ActiveRecord pattern can be thrown on top of that and you still get CRUD within a ""unit of work"" context.<p>I like it. :)",1308268696

I actually wasn't sure if this would be the best subreddit, if there is one I will gladly ask my question there.<p>I applied for an exchange to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in January, but I could actually finish all my schooling and find a job asap. I want to go to Hong Kong to do some traveling, and take a few interesting CS courses like web search and data mining. I won't actually need those courses - I will have enough credits to graduate, but I figure doing this exchange could be a great experience. Plus I would like to learn some Cantonese as well (background is half Iranian and half Italian/full Canadian). They also have a great CS/Engineering program. I figure it would look great on the resume as well.<p>The problem is, if I was to do my last semester in Hong Kong, usually in your last semester is when you are looking for jobs... And of course, there is the opportunity cost. How much could I be making instead of travelling? But at the same time, when will I ever get a chance to live in a different city again? Maybe for work, but doing it for school would be a bit more carefree. Also, I have not ruled out the possibility of doing my own startup, it is a dream of mine, but I may need another year or two of experience before I do that, I haven't figured that out yet. When my friend and I are ready, that is the plan.<p>ALSO, one last thing - I have already done an exchange to the Czech Republic, but it was more for fun, I did not do Comp Sci over there, just some arts courses.<p>I appreciate any advice you can give me :)<p>tl;dr - Get a job and make money, or delay graduating and do one more semester of school in Hong Kong?",1308268502

It represents the only attempt I've seen to document the procedure many self-taught programmers followed to learn programming by exploring.  At first, reading the instructions about carefully typing in the exercises, it took me some time to realize the point (and I don't think someone would get much value out of <i>only</i> typing in the exercises); however, once I read some of the ""Extra Credit"" exercises it made perfect sense as an introduction to learning by exploration.

It takes practice.  I do a lot of it.  I never really fit in anywhere I go.

Present your views as a standing-on-your-own-two-feet position, not a shooting-down-the-opposition thing.<p>Show some respect -- agree to disagree, make no attempt to ""win people over"", much less ""win"".<p>Stick to the issues.  When you dissent, inevitably there will be enormous social pressure swirling around your lack of going along to get along.  Anyone who speaks to you will likely try to put all kinds of crap on you about what they think you are saying. Politely clarify, as many times as it takes.<p>Judge the timing and context carefully.  There is a time and place to offer an alternate point of view.  There are other times and places where it's so not worth it.<p>Word your dissent very carefully.  If your goal is to get people to really think and not just punch buttons, like it or not, the burden is on the minority voice to make an effort to communicate effectively.  If you are going along with the majority opinion, you can express yourself sloppily and people won't care.

I went to school in Waterloo (where RIM is) and worked for 4 months in product design at Apple, so I am pretty aware of the differences between the two companies. Here are my thoughts on your points:<p>1) Very true. Apple is anal about the smallest details, RIM isn't. RIM has too many products in parallel development to dedicate the kind of resources they would need to match Apple. Just can't happen. Just accept it and come with your own style.
2) I absolutely love this. RIM does have a lot of manufacturing done overseas, but they have a very modern manufacturing facility right in Waterloo. Bring it all here and hype that up. It might flop, but it's a ballsy move that people would appreciate.
3) I am not sure if this is the case anymore, but for a while there, BlackBerry's were being shipped without App World on them. Wtf!
4) I disagree here. Their acquisition of QNX was brilliant. Use the playbook and you realize that it's an entirely different operating system than OS6. I think it could be very successful on their phones.
5) Interesting. Would help to become the low-cost smartphone while keeping margins relatively high.<p>In my opinion, it all comes down to how well QNX can create a compelling smartphone operating system. Do it well, and RIM will do just fine capitalizing on their legacy customers and getting those who want a keyboard. Screw it up, we might be looking at the next Palm.",1308266529

Bear in mind that <i>RIM</i> probably has more profits in mobile than Google.  Would you argue that profits as a metric is still useful in this case?<p>Usually, unless there are serious switching costs (see Microsoft-of-the-90s), production learning curves (see Exxon), etc, excess profits invite high levels of competition and the mobile market seems pretty crazily competitive and innovative right now. (HTC 3D?!  Gimmicky?  Sure.  Super cool?  Totally!)",1308265503

Periodically, I need to rebuild the squashfs to reclaim space in the aufs writable directory.<p>I once had a script something like this:<p><pre><code>    mksquashfs /usr /squashed/usr/usr_tmp.sfs -b 65536
    umount -l /usr
    umount -l /squashed/usr/ro
    rm /squashed/usr/usr.sfs

    rm -rf /squashed/usr/rw/*
    mount /squashed/usr/ro
    mount /usr
</code></pre>
Guess what happens if you hit Ctrl-C during the mksquashfs?  That's right, bash runs all the rest too, including the deletion of the old squashfs file.  I was left without a /usr, and it was brutal.  Managed to recover (it's incredible how resilient a linux system is, as long as /bin and /lib are intact), and immediately put ""set -e"" in almost every bash script on my machine (I also fixed the script to keep the system in a recoverable state at all times...).",1308265482

I'm not saying ditch the touch screen completely, but they need to stop following so closely in Apple's product development footsteps.<p>2. RIM needs to stop being shy about where they manufacture their products.  They need to bring manufacturing completely (as in 100%) in to North America and advertise the heck out of that.  Apple relies on inexpensive, cheap labor - hit them in the marketing cahones.<p>3. RIM needs to build a profitable developer marketplace.  The only reason anyone cares about iOS Apps is because there is a chance small developers can make a lot of money developing.  RIM needs to create a system where developers can easily earn money.  From in-app purchases, to a robust in-app ad serving platform to flexible purchasing options, RIM needs to take a giant step back and let a developer develop any app they want and charge any way they want.<p>4. RIM needs to remember that it is first and foremost, a hardware company.  They've <i>never</i> been good at making pretty software that works well.  Palm, Handspring, HP, Microsoft, and Apple have all at one time or another beat RIM time and again with software - but rarely hardware.  Mobile Internet Devices don't need to be complicated or even revolutionary - they just need to be sturdy, refined and fashionable.  Forget about saving money on Curve keyboards, forget about trying to breakthrough some crappy ""clicking screen"", build really great hardware, even if that hardware doesn't conform to the latest trends.<p>5. Last, RIM needs to kick cellular providers in the butt.  They need to step up where Apple hasn't and make their consumer level data plans inexpensive, open and user friendly.",1308265457

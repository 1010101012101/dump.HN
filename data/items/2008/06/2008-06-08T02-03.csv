All the novices have significantly lowered the average PHP developer's salary compared to other languages.  Basically, there's no skill and no money in PHP, so the good people don't use it.",1212893839

Of course, I've also seen tons of horrible Perl (and PHP, and even Lisp).<p>Basically, in the hands of incompetent programmers, everything is unreadable.  If you are disciplined, you can write easily-readable Perl.  I (and my coworkers) do it every day.<p>Oh, one other thing... the linked article is from 2000.  In the last 8 years, the Perl community has figured out how to program... so most of his points aren't relevant anymore.  Nobody writes 2000-style Perl anymore.",1212893430

211847,comment,211782,211782,0,0,thorax,,,"I loooove Python. But if asked to ""bet the farm"" on a web app, I'd go with PHP because it's been successfully demonstrated again in again in every form of web app you can imagine. In a year, I'd recommend Python, but I still find Django and the other web frameworks a bit too immature and clunky to do things that PHP has been hacking with for years and years. As much as I hate to say it, for the Python community the web server has been an afterthought until the past two years. PHP was bred there.<p>I probably would say it's a closer call if we hadn't found a great MVC framework for PHP called Code Igniter that just makes PHP (of all things) much more pleasurable to hack in than it used to be.<p>All this being said, you're not risking much by going with Python/Django. But if the farm is on the line, I'd personally have to go with LAMPhp.",1212891263

The Yahoo team has done an astonishingly good job of demonstrating what javascript looks like if you treat it as a language worth using well, as opposed to forcing it to pretend it's something it's not (eg. prototype).  I've been working with it for a year and a half, recently migrated a substantial Rails app from Prototype/Scriptaculous, and couldn't be happier.",1212890974

Both are pretty much just like Perl and Java with only minor syntax changes.<p>If you want to expand your understanding of computing in general, while <i>also</i> learning a new language, <i>and</i> while doing a webapp, if I were you I'd learn Common Lisp and try out Hunchentoot.

My progression was PHP -> Python -> TurboGears -> Pylons -> Django.  I can say with confidence that it is the best of them all.  Yes, many choices have been made for you, but they have been made in an elegant, Pythonic way, and you retain the ability to get under the hood to a healthy extent.",1212890851

The site will be highly configurable/maintainable by its community from establishing/interacting within groups to tweeking page layouts.</i><p>How much of your app can be built by hooking together existing Drupal modules?<p>If the answer is ""lots"" -- and because your brief description sounds like a long list of stock parts from the Social Network aisle at Costco, I wouldn't be surprised if it is -- perhaps you should consider Drupal. Which means PHP, alas, but that's a small price to pay for avoiding the annoyance of building every single one of your site's 120,000 proposed features yourself, from scratch.<p>If the answer is ""a lot, except for features X and Y, and I hate Drupal's existing, buggy options for Z"" the Drupal community will be really happy to see you develop and contribute open-source code that can do X and Y. And we probably <i>all</i> hate Z, so fix it and you'll be our hero. You'll have plenty of time to work on Z because you won't be spending time redeveloping things like ""basic user logins with emailed password reminders"", or ""users can create and join groups which have their own subsites"" from scratch -- yet again -- in a language whose idioms you haven't learned yet.<p>If the answer is ""not much""... may I suggest that you seriously reduce the scope of your first project?<p>Of course, if the proposed app is less of an actual future product than it is an excuse to broaden your mind by learning a language that's not Perl or Java, you should probably grab onto Python or Ruby with both hands. PHP has many practical features, but it doesn't have much to teach a Perl programmer.",1212890672

211837,comment,211782,211782,0,0,treed,,,"Python. For a lot of reasons. It's easy. It has a lot of libraries. The Python based CMSs are better. And most importantly it's easier to find decent python programmers. The vast majority of PHP guys I have interviewed ONLY know one language: PHP. The python guys tend to be much more well rounded. Of course the PHP guys are usually cheaper. You get what you pay for in this case. I would also have to recommend against perl. I did perl for 10 years before I switched to python 4 years ago. I think their philosophies say it all: Perl: There's more than one way to do it. Python: There's one obviously right way to do it. Sure, that's a huge generalization but I find it true in a lot of cases. Perl really is line noise compared to Python. And reading someone else's Perl is a real challenge.",1212890559

The Reddit product scales independantly of the number of redditors or subreddits, because the Reddit product isn't hosted.<p>This is all a tangent, though. My fault.",1212890557

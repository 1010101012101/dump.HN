Everything was suddenly more vivid and memorable. She ordered a smoked-turkey and Boursin cheese sandwich on French bread, with lettuce and tomato, and a large Diet Coke.</i><p>Is the NYT so hard-up for revenues they're asking their authors to slip these in?<p>I can't imagine Lewis wrote that on his own.",1188139252

Selfish programmers, however talented, don't fix bugs.<p>Filtering out selfish talented programmers is not easy. Yet they probably are the reason why organizations get paranoid.<p>An extreme solution is to make sure bugs are fixed (somehow) BEFORE new code is created ; selfish programmers won't stand the heat very long.<p>Fortunately test suites, automatized non regression testing, is becoming popular.",1188137803

I didn't ask or entitled that YC's jobs section should be devoted for anyone, but instead provoked the subject for discussion for openinng maybe a new open category, assuming this is not about YC news anymore.<p>not my fault if you want to look YC friendly and pitch with anything that doesn't look like so.",1188137550

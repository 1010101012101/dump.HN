At a place like Microsoft, Oracle, Apple - the answer is that the big guys built the place and gave everyone their jobs so therefore they answer to them. Who are you? Some guy who just went through college and took no risk in joining some giant in their field. Who are they? The guys who took the risks to start those places. So if they think your ideas are shit, then they can say it and you have to take it. But at a company of 4 people, who are you? You are just a co founder of a (probably as of yet unprofitable) little startup company. Where are you getting the power to call their work shit from? Plus, if its a guy like that their time is extremely valuable and you are wasting it with your shit ideas.<p>I bet if you go into microsoft and sit in on the development meetings between a team on basically the same level on the org chart, they aren't nearly as hostile as top down reviews.",1239253174

It's all about your SEO goals & priorities.<p>Sure, in general, the more content, the more Google traffic you are going to get.  I'm not really disputing that.  All I'm saying is if you take away stuff, the ranking that is left will be concentrated on what is left on the page.<p>For example, take the situation where you really convert on one key phrase and not much on anything else.  In that situation, you really want to concentrate on that term and you probably want to strip out things that don't help you rank on that term.

My main gripe with them is I expected my priorities to at least somewhat translate into what pages were indexed, and at least on my sites, these priorities seem to have no effect.  A second gripe is that for some people they are difficult to set up, and so if you were going to pick whether to do link building or sitemaps, I'd choose link building.

The more content I add to my website, the better it ranks in aggregate and the better the front page ranks in particular.  If you want I can even show you a graph of amount of content versus traffic as a result of Google.  Let me spoil the surprise: it fits n * (# pages) ^ (1 + y).<p>Your pages do compete against each other in some narrow senses: for any given query, you'll typically be capped at two results in the SERP (results page), so if you had a third best option on your site it gets left out in the cold.  However, pages on your website are (and <i>should be treated as</i>) comrades in arms.<p>The more links my page on, e.g., Jane Austen bingo cards collects, the more trust my domain will have and the more juice that individual page will pass to the literature category its in and the other page it links to.

I was only trying to point out that ""there's only one way to do things"" may not actually be the opposite of expressiveness.  Liberally
 applied it's possibly neutral or better.<p>[1] An argument could be made that accurately communicating the feel of the code is the most efficient way to communicate it, although I'm more concerned with the time it takes both to read and to write the code - surely at some point of massaging your code for readability you reach the point diminishing returns :)",1239250000

Another example is I now rarely abbreviate in variable and function names. I've decided I waste more time remembering my abbreviations than I would spend typing the word.",1205416686

To know its limits you should probably learn about other things that aren't Javascript but closely related to it eg other programming languages, web browsers, HTML, DOM etc.<p>Good luck!<p>Let us know how it works out.",1205415391

135930,comment,135596,135596,0,0,andr,,,"1) I have a little switch on my laptop that turns WiFi on. When I need to focus, I just turn it off. I only allow myself to turn it on if it's a development-related thing I need to do.<p>2) I use my down time (subway, boring classes, etc.) to work out what I need to do next. I start with a high-level todo of features then iteratively break them down to smaller pieces, usually going as detailed as function signatures and database table design. Not only does it make it easier to get work done once I get to the computer, but putting the design of a feature in the back of my mind for a few hours will usually bring out the design flaws before I write a single line of code. (My red pocket Moleskine works great.)<p>3) If I haven't done the feature design ahead of time, when I start a new complex method, I write the method as English comments, one step per line. After that, I write the implementation of each comment in code.",1205414939

I'm not talking about N.YC readers who <i>think</i> they are bad programmers.  No, I'm talking about the fact that there are reams and reams of plain old bad advice on JavaScript out there that still outrank the good stuff in most search engines.<p>99% of the time a Google search on a JavaScript problem will score you pages of hits with antiquated, non-standard, buggy or IE-only approaches.",1205414648

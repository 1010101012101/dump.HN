1592183,comment,1589650,1590668,0,0,icarus_drowning,,,"Regulation is a form of power for the government. Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but government and corporations certainly share a desire to be as powerful as possible. Giving either power should thus be a carefully considered move. In some instances, it makes sense. In some it doesn't. But one can be sure that, either way, the entrenched institutions will not willingly give up any power granted to them.<p>I think the most salient factor here is that regulation requires good information on how that industry/space works. I don't think its questionable that we are not sure what future the wireless/mobile internet holds, only that it big. Regulating it properly right now seems like a dubious proposition-- either through the traditional kind of government regulation or through the ""self-regulation"" of large corporations, who will naturally shape such self-regulation to their own advantage.",1281459493

1592181,story,,,2,5,rwl,"Ask HN: How do you explore a Lisp/Scheme?",,"Most of the programming I have done is in Python. One of my favorite features in Python is that<p><pre><code>  >>> help(X) 
</code></pre>
gives useful information for just about any object X.  This is great for exploring modules, learning about the methods and member variables of classes, and finding out what functions do; it's an important ""bottom-up"" tool for exploring the language. In Python, I can often think, ""I need something similar to, but not quite the same as, X; X is defined in module M; so let's do help(M) to see if M has the function I want."" Often, I can tell at a glance over the docstrings that the function I need is there.<p>This is complemented by the quality of documentation for the Python standard library, which provides an excellent ""top-down"" reference. Between these two features, I usually have no trouble finding just the function I need when I need it.<p>In my efforts to learn Lisp, particularly various Scheme implementations, I often find myself thinking: ""I <i>know</i> there's already a library function to do this; now how do I find it?"" I find it more difficult to browse modules, particularly in the ""bottom-up"" way I'm used to from Python.  I find this somewhat surprising, given Lisp's reputation as a language for doing bottom-up, exploratory programming.<p>How do Lisp hackers explore their language, particularly when they're starting to learn a new implementation?  Is there some Lisp equivalent of help() that I'm not aware of? I can't believe that the answer is just: ""Read R?RS. Read the HyperSpec. Read the code."" Am I missing something?",1281459483

Some of their techniques don't fit my personality.<p>The way I learn mathematics is suited only for a small percentage of the population.  As an example, I have little use for diagrams.  I don't think in terms of geometry but in terms of abstract definitions.  I don't need a diagram to conceptualize and understand that pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.  Even with diagrams most of my students don't understand what this means.<p>Meyer's enthusiasm is contagious and I appreciate that about him.  It's exceptional, in fact.  It's also not duplicable by most teachers.  He's found a style that works for him.  It doesn't work for everyone though.<p>One of his methods involves watching videos of water pouring out of a container and experimentally verifying whether or not his calculations make sense.  For me, this is a great big yawn.  I could not bear watching such a thing in a class as a student.<p>The real problem in education, as I see it, is that schools do a terrible job of matching student personality with teacher personality.  I believe that solving this problem would significantly increase retention and learning.<p>It's hard to fit a teaching method to a personality that isn't predisposed to such a method.  It just doesn't work.  The human interaction dynamic of such a class is a mess.",1281459330

1592144,comment,1591225,1591225,0,0,Quarrelsome,,,"If you _really_ want more money the most effective method is to to ""play hardball"". This play can double or even triple your income from a entry point salary if you're worth it and you play it right.<p>The deal with hardball is that you have to leave your current company. You may not actually leave the company but you must be _prepared_ to, otherwise it wont work and you will back down too quickly.<p>As usual, look around the market for better pay and try to get a job interview and a position for pay that you like the sound of. Once this is done and dusted, hand in your resignation and state that the reason you are leaving the job is due to pay. State a figure that would keep you at the company but obviously keep this very private between yourself and your manager. You can be a little cheeky with this figure, depending on how much you want to remain there.<p>If they value your work sufficiently they will accept your figure and modify your salary to keep you there. If they don't you leave for the other job that pays better.<p>For best results you need to get the timing of the hardball perfect. You need your employers to either be desperate, guilty or a bit of both. Desperation is achieved by doing this at a critical moment. Say, the most senior member of staff on your project leaves, thus leaving you with the most knowledge of the system. Or in my case, regulation of the mortgage market was about 8 months away and I was the only member of staff with sufficient knowledge to implement their new system.<p>Guilt can be even better though depending on the type of manager you have. Essentially you want the manager to feel as though they owe you something. For example, if your pay review was supposed to happen six months after your start but it has been twelve or eighteen months then they will feel guilty about not doing it sooner. If they have cancelled a project you worked hard on or did you some other kind of disservice your guilt ratio increases and you can cash in.<p>I managed to push my salary from £12k to £36k in one fell swoop this way about 8 years ago. It's how I started contracting.<p>For context, the company had cancelled my own software development project (which despite being poor code (when i look back on it) was fit for purpose and worked). They replaced this with a system bought in (which they had to buy on a management agreement from joining a particular group) that was just a confusing mess of VBScript and SQL stored procedures. It didn't work, wasn't built for purpose (a common operation would lock up the database server for 2 minutes+) and I only _just_ managed to stitch it together in time for regulation day (actually it was a few days after, I had to manually do a lot of the quotes in the first few days of regulation.. ). And when I say stitched this process involved a bunch of programs I had also hacked together to cover the gaps.",1281459051

After being unemployed for a while, my resources are finally almost depleted.<p>About a week ago, I found a job for a software tester that asked for experience with a number of programming languages, so I assumed it would at least be a technical position and it might be a nice change of pace.<p>They called me for an HR interview n Thursday, and that's when I discovered that they apparently no longer needed anyone in my area. They said they could need me in another city relatively nearby (4-5hr. drive from here, so I'd need to relocate), but the position was just black-box, no-code testing. They also asked me for my salary requirements, and when I hesitated (as I knew it would likely be below my expectations), she spoke up and told me the typical range for the position - about $10k less than I was making before.<p>I decided I needed the money, so I did their technical interview the next day. I think it went really well (there were at least two instances where I answered a question she was about to ask as part of the question preceding it) so I'm expecting an offer, but it still feels like a major blow to my ego to even be considering taking the job.<p>I figure I'll set a one-year limit on the job, training however I need to in order to get out of there by then, and I'll use my salary to help fund a project I want to build. Lemonade from lemons.<p>The point is, sometimes you just need to do what you need to in order to keep going.

However, it's important to keep in mind that essentially <i>all</i> of the things a newbie needs to get started with Rails are in a single, self contained framework that is (in my opinion) incredibly easy to use.<p>I had well over five years of Java experience when I took on the latest in Java-based web framework.

1591976,comment,1590524,1591161,0,0,roc,,,"The persistence of paper indicates nothing more than a failure of existing software, not of concept.<p>The biggest shortfall is that computers do not allow arbitrary input at arbitrary times. You have to prime them to accept a certain type of input, which takes a wasteful amount of time.<p>Further, you are then typically locked into a certain rigid type of input, which may not be appropriate.  E.g. The default for text entry boxes is to only allows text, not annotation, so work that involves annotation is poorly suited to most text entry software.  Similarly, post-it applications tend not to allow arbitrary diagrams, even though that may be the most effective way to record a note.<p>There's no reason it <i>must</i> be that way, it just tends to be, because thoughtless software development is cheaper and easier.<p>Paperless certainly isn't feasible for everyone today. But that doesn't make it unattainable.  And let's not pretend for a moment that just because pure paperless isn't feasible for many, that a dramatic <i>reduction</i> isn't possible.  Despite the remaining valid uses, the overwhelming majority of paper produced is pure waste.<p>As for the 'acting' commentary you cite, that isn't omitted in a paperless future.  It's absolutely preserved in the context of the visual/textual exchange of sending someone an email with the report as attachment/link/etc.<p>If anything, it's amplified by the asynchronous nature of drafting the message; you're forced to think about its presentation and have the time to give it the right delivery; versus a time/space-constrained physical exchange.",1281456550
1591975,comment,1591493,1591493,0,0,Zak,,,"I nearly went in to law enforcement, and the arguments made by police and prosecutors in this article sound like bullshit to me. The strongest arguments, in my opinion are the lack of a chain of custody, and privacy for third-parties.<p>Chain of custody simply means knowing who had control over a piece of evidence and when. It comes in to play when someone in a trial claims that a piece of evidence does not match reality and may have been tampered with. In a criminal trial, deciding the credibility of evidence is generally a matter for the jury. In a non-criminal complaint about an officer, it's a matter for the officer's supervisor. In no case that I am aware of is it illegal to collect evidence because the chain of custody may be difficult or impossible to determine.<p>Privacy for third parties is a bit more tricky. I think it might be a good idea to have some restrictions on distributing videos of police encounters with other people without permission from those people (but not the on-duty police officers involved) or obscuring their identities. Many states already have rules against recording conversations without permission, and an exemption for recording police officers wouldn't necessarily apply to recording interactions between a police officer and a third party, so this may be a non-issue in certain debates.",1281456507

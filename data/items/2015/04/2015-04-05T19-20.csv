Previously he famously offered students money to drop out of college. This is especially scary considering his sphere of influence and amount of money-power he can throw in. Why someone as smart as him would do this?<p>To me it looks like he has got it all wrong here: Higher education is <i>not</i> an investment. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> a preparation to get a job. People should not be considering higher education as a way of getting lots of money in future. Higher education is an opportunity to delve in to subject that you dreamed about all your teenage life. Did you wanted to become astronomer? Physicists? Mathematician? Painter? Were you interested in learning why biggest wars in history happened? How our ancestors lived 10,000 years ago? Do you want to build airplanes? If you asked these questions and were intensely interested in some subject, higher education is a tremendous gateway to do what you love for rest of your life as opposed to possibility of becoming millionaire first and <i>then</i> do all these things. No one should be persuaded to be turned away from it. Not everyone needs to be in rush for making million and retire before 30. Some people wants to do what they love to their last dying day. Not everyone needs to be startup founder either. As Guy Kawasaki said, jobs are for rest of your life (even if you are &quot;boss&quot; - it&#x27;s still a <i>job</i>), education is just those few early years when your brain is hungry and eager to absorb everything. Your best years should be spent in studying something cool and worthwhile rather than selling underwears and rental apartments to people. You should take advantage of it. I consider advising youth to drop out from their selected area of study with a lure of making millions in startups a sin.",1428263817

It would reduce the number of cars in existence at any given time potentially freeing up space (garages, driveways, parking garages, street parking, etc.) for other things.  Also, cars would wear out faster (in time) which means you would shift the average age of cars on the road down.  So on average it would also increase the safety and efficiency of cars on the road as well.<p>Imagine 10 people who drive 10k miles per year who own cars that last 100k miles (just for the sake of simplicity).  Right now, those people would each own one car for 10 years.  In the system you suggest they would all share one car which would be replaced every year.  So they would be driving a (technologically) new car every year.  Of course this assumes that none of them ever want/need to drive at the same time.

9325094,comment,9324433,9324433,0,0,jhayward,,,"This is an interesting calculation to do but the specific example needs improvement.<p>First, the calculation of the available supply is based on known,
existing reserves economically retrievable at current prices.  Changes
in demand will change both the known reserve quantity and the price.
Lithium is currently about $1/kg, so there is plenty of room to grow
price to increase supply without affecting the cost of batteries.  So
a reasonable estimate of lithium supply has to include both demand volume and price.  Reserve
growth based on demand volume and price is a very tricky thing to forecast.<p>Second, the choice of 3.4 billion vehicles to &quot;bring the entire world
to North American levels&quot; as a goal is an unrealistic number for many
reasons. Regional economics, geography, and social density vary quite
radically around the world.  The built infrastructure varies and
supports many different transportation modalities.  It also doesn&#x27;t
take in to account changes in technology, infrastructure, and social
organisation during such a radical transition.  So a more reasonable
estimate would be to simply replace all vehicles on the road with
BEVs.<p>Last, the note could also be improved by doing sanity checks.  For
instance, could the world production capacity of any other energy
storage mechanism, including oil, hydrogen, ethanol, etc. support 3.4
billion vehicles?  It&#x27;s always useful to compare what you are
calculating to the alternatives.<p>There are currently about 1 billion cars in use in the world.  Using
just the reserve numbers quoted in the article it seems economically
feasible to replace them all with Lithium chemistry battery electric

That&#x27;s a quality of life factor but ultimately it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s important. The important thing is supply, mostly of energy.<p>(It&#x27;s also important to note that to a great extent the West has cleaned up its environment by outsourcing polluting industries to Asia, Africa, and South America.)<p>Last I checked we still got more than 80% of our energy from fossil fuels. That has changed very, very little in the past 50 years. My grandparents drove a gasoline car, my parents drove a gasoline car, and I drive a gasoline car, and the power grid where I live is powered by 60% natural gas and 15% coal. Where I grew up it was almost 100% coal, same as it was three generations ago.<p>We were supposed to be driving EVs powered by fusion reactors by now.<p>If you&#x27;re rich you can buy solar panels and an EV and convince yourself there is no problem, but until that stuff falls geometrically in price to the point that it achieves mass adoption it&#x27;s a luxury toy that will make no impact. Either that or the future will require that 90% of humanity be reduced to medieval subsistence-level poverty. That&#x27;s not <i>quite</i> the collapse some have predicted, but I highly doubt that sort of neo-feudal civilization is going to go to the stars. So it counts for the Fermi Paradox. The universe may be filled with such small, limited, planet-bound intelligences.<p>I&#x27;m slightly encouraged by an apparent Moore&#x27;s Law in solar, but storage is now the bottleneck. I&#x27;m also very cynical about technological advancement outside of IT and a few other narrow areas. I agree with Peter Thiel that basically all major technological advancement outside of computers and some biotech stopped around 1970.

This typically means memorizing implementation of pretty much all popular solutions in these contests, mastering odd tricks while ignoring general insights, less attention on elegance and maintainability, less incentivized to work in group, more tuned to getting <i>any</i> solution as quickly as possible instead of striving to get best possible solution, ignoring any areas that are not popular in such contests etc. This kind of brain training obviously has its negative. However on average, winners from contests will usually out perform your average programmer any day, they just won&#x27;t outperform our super stars who would probably disqualify well before semi-finals because they were busy in learning other things that are not useful at competitions.<p>My observations from dealing with one such person (I know, a great statistical sample size) very closely was that they are extremely fast learners and usually gravitate toward working on small very well defined problem that they <i>already</i> know how to solve but they suck at getting big picture, learning something large and complex and understanding the intricate interdependencies involved in complex systems.",1428261735

It assumes that we are not worthy of visiting but an argument like that suggests that they’ve already found us and interstellar travel is feasible. They’ve also solved all the logistic problems you’re referring to. Whether they like to make contact or not is somewhat irrelevant to this context.<p>For the sake of argument let’s linger on that assumption for a while. How for example did they found us when our civilization achieved radio signals transmission in the last couple of centuries? That means that they’re close by, unless FTL travel is feasible in which case we can safely assume the whole galaxy should be teeming with life. But if they’re close by shouldn’t we be able to spot them? And if they’re far away that means they should already have colonized half the galaxy before they decide to launch an expedition to a planet thousands of light years away.<p>The worrying factor relating to the “Fermi Paradox” is that it suggests that maybe life is extremely rare. We could very well be the only living souls in this part of the Universe and that’s kind of heart breaking considering the sheer size of the whole thing.<p>By the way, your assumption is called the &quot;Zoo Hypothesis&quot; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_hypothesis</a><p>Oh, and while we&#x27;re in this scenario I&#x27;d urge everyone to read the following SF short.

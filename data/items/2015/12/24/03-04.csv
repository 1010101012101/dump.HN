10787033,comment,10786512,10786815,0,0,derefr,,,"How about being build-system defined? As in, let me specify a &quot;target behavior profile&quot; as a switch to the compiler, which would be shorthand for a bunch of switches that define specific results for specific undefined behaviors: &quot;-foverflow=checked&quot; (add explicit checks) vs. &quot;-foverflow=wrap&quot; (do what most ISAs already do, but even on target ISAs that <i>don&#x27;t</i> do that) vs. &quot;-foverflow=clip&quot; (do something weird that no target ISA does, like making short 65535 + 1 = 65535.)<p>I would expect that a single-pass compiler like gcc would look at the toolchain&#x27;s target ISA, compare it to these switches, and then generate extra shim code to adapt any cases of target-arch-does-X into code-does-Y-on-X, while letting do-X-on-X just translate directly. Basically the same way floating-point code gets compiled: architectures that support it get it, architectures that don&#x27;t get a shim.<p>Meanwhile, a two-stage compiler with an intermediate representation, like clang, should generate IR with granular types specifying the chosen behavioral semantics on each operation. The second step in such a toolchain becomes much more formalized: rather than taking code that can contain undefined behavior as input, and then &quot;defining&quot; it during translation in some random heuristic manner, you just take code that already <i>specifies</i> the behavior it wants in full, and then attempt to generate target-arch code that does whatever it says in the most efficient manner possible <i>while not breaking any of the guarantees the IR asks for</i>. In other words, your code-generation stage becomes a static recompiler, like this one[1] for the NES ISA.<p>And you can always specify a switch at code-gen time that will error out the compilation if you&#x27;ve done something that has caused shims to be inserted. Or even a switch to throw away the behavioral semantics the IR asks for and substitute your own, like happens in most performance-focused emulator software.<p>[1] <a href=""http://andrewkelley.me/post/jamulator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewkelley.me/post/jamulator.html</a>",1450929459

10787025,comment,10786512,10786716,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> But why can&#x27;t it just produce something different on each system?<p>It could. That is indeed how Rust, for example, defines it.<p>But in C &quot;unspecified values&quot; have a way of turning into undefined behavior really quickly.<p>Here&#x27;s an actual bug we have in Rust [1]:<p><pre><code>    let index = 1.04E+17 as u8;\n    let array = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, array[index as usize]); // segfault\n</code></pre>\nWhy does that segfault instead of emitting a safe panic? Because the IR looks something roughly like this (in C notation):<p><pre><code>    double tmp = 1.04e+17;\n    uint8_t index = (uint8_t)tmp;\n    vector *array = make_a_vector();\n    if (index >= array->length)\n        panic();\n    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, array->ptr[index]);\n</code></pre>\nThe optimizer correctly determines that the cast from double to uint8_t results in an undefined value. In LLVM terminology, <i>undefined values can arbitrarily change value over their live range</i>, and this is allowed per the C specification. So LLVM is allowed to replace the conditional &quot;index >= array->length&quot; with &quot;false&quot;, and this is indeed what it does, leading to this code:<p><pre><code>    double tmp = 1.04e+17;\n    uint8_t index = (uint8_t)tmp;\n    vector *array = make_a_vector();\n    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, array->ptr[index]);\n</code></pre>\nAnd with that, LLVM optimizes out our bounds check, and safe code is able to perform arbitrary memory reads and writes. Note that all we needed was an unspecified value resulting from a floating point cast!<p>The fix is probably going to be to stop using LLVM&#x27;s floating point conversion instructions and to instead use some &quot;safe conversion&quot; intrinsics that we&#x27;ll define.<p>> What compilers do today should be the recourse of absolute last resort, and the sort of thing that makes its authors feel bad. But it seems to be treated as a matter of course. I don&#x27;t know what to say.<p>You might think that I would think this way too after fighting bugs like the above, but I actually don&#x27;t. I appreciate the performance that undefined behavior brings to C, and I think we&#x27;d have much slower programs without it. Undefined behavior resulting from strict aliasing is the reason why a for loop setting an array to zero can optimize to a 10x faster memset, for example. And heavily inlined series of functions, as well as generic libraries like the C++ STL, frequently require these optimizations to get reasonable performance. I think it&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that much of the software performance we take for granted—stuff you care about, like codecs, games, browser implementations—is the result of optimizations that are enabled by undefined behavior.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184</a>",1450929332

I recently opened an account for my new mobile game on Facebook, to do some Facebook ads.

So if anyone working at Facebook sees this please please help me out here. Thanks!<p>PS.\nIt is unbelievable that Facebook could just do this, shutting down your account, without giving a why.

Instead of thinking of it as an optimization, think of it as a check that doesn&#x27;t need to be inserted into the code. If you can tell the compiler &quot;I promise I won&#x27;t overflow this variable&quot;, that&#x27;s a lot less error checking it needs to insert on every iteration.<p>> I don&#x27;t believe C should be a language where the compiler does all sorts of high-level optimisation; it should be a straightforward &quot;do what I say&quot; type of language where you get almost exactly what you write<p>Well, you could just compile with -O0 then. I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with C on this, but it&#x27;s pretty clear the community has made the decision to prioritize speed over safety. Nothing wrong with that, but if safety is your priority you should probably look at things other than C.

And, every single one of those retirees is drawing a huge percentage of their salaries as their pension, for life, as well as enjoying tremendous paid benefits.<p>The problem here is the divide between people who have business experience and those who do not.  Any small business person understands, without having to run any calculations, that having the cost of a position multiplied by 6 (because you are paying 1 active worker and 5 retirees) is utterly unsustainable.  Or that, installing a series of automated welders while not being able to lay off 50 people is a formula for bankruptcy.<p>Do you hire a gardener, cleaning service or pool person?  Imagine having to continue paying them 80% of their monthly fees after they retire.  And then you have to hire a new service to do the job.<p>Now you go out and buy a robotic lawn mower, vacuum or pool cleaner.<p>And you can&#x27;t fire them.<p>You have to continue paying those service providers for a service they will not be performing because their contract says so.  Forever.<p>Get the point?<p>We can engage in the fallacy of attacking the source all we want, yet, it is impossible to attack the math, which is the point here.  These arrangements are mathematically predetermined to result in the destruction of companies and jobs unless Superman comes down from the skies and brings with him a supernatural solution of some sort.<p>Or, we pretend all is well, grab some tax money to continue propping them up and shift the problem forward to another generation.

As both theory and practice are showing, you&#x27;re never going to be able to get the consensus you want out of C. There&#x27;s no &quot;saving&quot; C... not because that&#x27;s somehow mathematically impossible, but simply because the project is too staggeringly large for us to even wrap our heads around. It would literally be easier to get people to start using another language...<p>... so, why not do that then? We have, for perhaps the first time in 40 years, a candidate for a systems language that can truly replace C, that has truly different semantics (i.e., not C++, which is still profoundly C with a lot of stuff bodged on the side). I&#x27;d suggest trying to use Rust, and working with that team to nail down whatever remaining issues may yet be undefined in Rust that may cause trouble in the future. Whatever remaining practical problems there may be (and my impression is that that isn&#x27;t really a long list), work on resolving them.<p>Again, I am not being sarcastic or cynical; it is truly my estimate that it would be easier to get people behind that than to fix C at this point. Probably by a good two or more orders of magnitude. Obviously we&#x27;re not going to rewrite all existing code. Obviously there&#x27;s a lot of code still to be written that is so deeply embedded in C that there&#x27;s no practical alternative to adding more C to it, even in a world of FFI support and such. But if the people who care about the idea of BoringC or Friendly C start getting behind Rust, getting their hands dirty with it, and doing what the Mozilla project is doing to find places where they can start slotting subsystems in cleanly to existing code bases, you may just be able to start creeping out of the mess we&#x27;re in now.<p>And... who knows. If this becomes acceptable, then generally considered a good idea, then best practice, then perhaps even something you need to do unless you want people to think poorly of you... perhaps real change will prove to be less intractable than we thought. People consistently overestimate change in the short term but underestimate in the long term. It is, perhaps, not too much to hope for that huge swathes of our fundamental systems could be running on Rust in 20 years, instead of C.<p>So I&#x27;ll reemphasize once again... yes, I know I&#x27;m proposing a staggeringly enormous change. The only thing that it has going for it is that I still think it&#x27;s easier than the staggeringly-enormous-squared other choice.<p><i>Something&#x27;s</i> gonna happen.

10786867,comment,10786512,10786716,0,0,overgard,,,"I think the problem is that some of these optimizations aren&#x27;t just compiler makers being greedy, they&#x27;re actually a huge benefit. IMO what&#x27;s missing is the ability to mark areas &quot;unsafe&quot; -- IE, tell the compiler &quot;it&#x27;s ok to take advantage of certain optimizations here&quot; while marking other areas &quot;please don&#x27;t goof with this&quot; (ie, security critical code). You can kind of do this with pragmas, but not really.<p>Here&#x27;s a good example from the llvm blog: ( <a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-...</a> )<p>> Signed integer overflow: If arithmetic on an &#x27;int&#x27; type (for example) overflows, the result is undefined. One example is that &quot;INT_MAX+1&quot; is not guaranteed to be INT_MIN. This behavior enables certain classes of optimizations that are important for some code. For example, knowing that INT_MAX+1 is undefined allows optimizing &quot;X+1 > X&quot; to &quot;true&quot;. Knowing the multiplication &quot;cannot&quot; overflow (because doing so would be undefined) allows optimizing &quot;X*2/2&quot; to &quot;X&quot;. While these may seem trivial, these sorts of things are commonly exposed by inlining and macro expansion. A more important optimization that this allows is for &quot;<=&quot; loops like this:<p>> for (i = 0; i <= N; ++i) { ... }<p>> In this loop, the compiler can assume that the loop will iterate exactly N+1 times if &quot;i&quot; is undefined on overflow, which allows a broad range of loop optimizations to kick in. On the other hand, if the variable is defined to wrap around on overflow, then the compiler must assume that the loop is possibly infinite (which happens if N is INT_MAX) - which then disables these important loop optimizations.",1450926298

Just say ""Navigate me to x"" or ""Directions to y"" or ""Find the nearest z"" and you get it right away in Google Maps/Navigation. Probably my favorite non-passive feature of it.<p>Then when staying at the hotel, it knows I'm staying there and tells me when I'm driving elsewhere how far away I am from it with traffic and how to go back via a notification.<p>Other times, if you call a place, like to order carryout, it knows you called it by the telephone number and then gives you a notification of how far away that place is and offers directions.",1363849196
5413421,comment,5412980,5413245,5,0,tolmasky,,,"I would actually agree to sign a contract the bound me to upgrade my Apple hardware every 1.5 years if it would guarantee they stop ruining Mac OS X. My problem isn't so much the fact I have to replace these things so often, its that its not even that great day 1 anymore. With the exception of AirPlay perhaps, just about every major facet of OS X has gotten so progressively worse for my workflow: Safari (bogs my computer down no matter how much ram I have), dual display support (a joke since Lion), Messages (<i>buggiest</i> piece of software I've ever used in my life, by a long shot), iTunes (same as Safari), etc etc etc<p>Edit: I'd like to point out one other thing. Before anyone chimes in with how Windows or Linux or other PC makers are worse, I completely agree with you. My position is that while Mac OS X may still be the ""best"", it has been a long time since it has been ""good"". I find little consolation in the fact that it is not ""as broken"" as everything else, nor do I think that's anything to be particularly proud of. Especially with the amount of money I've given them.",1363849184

5413418,comment,5411811,5411811,1,0,calhoun137,,,"A lot of comments are saying that Vim will massively increase your productivity, but I think that is completely missing what being a productive programmer is all about.  Just being able to type and edit things quickly isn't even half the battle, it's less than 1% in my opinion.<p>Productivity in programming is measured from the time you start a project till the time you finish.  So much time is often spent trying to find and fix bugs, and being productive is all about writing code in a way that minimizes the amount of bugs that show up, and being able to quickly find and fix them when they do.<p>Writing code at the optimal level of generality is a major factor,  No amount of editor tricks can make up for choosing the wrong level of generality to write your methods.  Too much generality and you are wasting time, too little and you have to deal with a bunch of special cases, or else rewrite large portions of code at some point.<p>It's important to be able to learn things very quickly on the spot when you have no other choice, but it's better to be able to immediately deal with situations without having to incur all of the productively losses that comes with doing that.  So much time is saved by being able to get the algorithm's and the numbers right on the first try.<p>It's also about a psychological battle of how hard you can push yourself without burning out, which is no trivial matter.<p>Once you are good at all that, then basically it's nice to also be able to pick up an extra few seconds here and there with a keyboard shortcut, an editor trick, or some precision mouse mechanics.",1363849111

I'm terribly sad to see it go, but I appreciate the value I've gotten out of it while it existed.<p>Plenty of web services -- maybe most -- die after a while.  Maybe the company offering it goes under, maybe nobody uses it, or maybe it's just not accomplishing the goals the company set out for it (ahem, Reader).

But, I've never seen <i>anything</i> to indicate that we consider Google's payments to us in any security/privacy decision.<p>DNT is not the ultimate solution to tracking on its own. It is part of a solution.<p>Consider this:<p>Let's say you go buy a box of doughnuts and take it to work, open it, and leave it open on a table next to your desk. Some people will think ""Hmm, I want one of those doughnuts but I'm not sure if it is OK to take one, so I won't"" and other people will just assume that it is OK to take one. (Why else would there be an open box of doughnuts? And/or isn't it better to ask forgiveness than permission?)<p>Let's say you write ""Do NOT take these doughnuts! They are mine!"" on the box with a big fat marker. If somebody were to take a doughnut, they would be <i></i>clearly<i></i> in the wrong in that situation, according to any kind of mainstream social convention.<p>Lots of people will say that it is wrong to take a doughnut without explicit permission. But, many, many people see the situation as being open to interpretation.<p>Now, let's say the doughnut shop pre-printed ""Do NOT take these doughnuts! They are mine!"" on every box. You might argue that that is the same thing as the hand-written sign. But, I would bet that the pre-printed message would get drowned out as people would normally share doughnuts out of these pre-printed boxes: ""Just ignore the box, they all say that; it doesn't mean anything."" The pre-printed message becomes less and less meaningful, even though the words are clear, unambiguous, and explicit. And, worse, you may be discouraged from writing your handwritten """"Do NOT take these doughnuts! They are mine!"" message on the box because, well, the box already says that. Effectively, that message pre-printed on the box is harmful, as its meaning is in the eye of the beholder--just like the open box sitting on the table with no message written on it at all.<p>Do you see how that could possibly be problematic? This is the problem that Sid and others at Mozilla are trying to solve. ""DNT: 1"" means it is <i></i>clearly<i></i> wrong to track this user because they've gone through special effort to tell you they don't want to be tracked.<p>It has nothing to do with Google's money.",1363848252

I'm aware that you can navigate by screen lines by using gj and gk).  The way this makes the text scroll by unpredictable amounts when you have paragraphs of text is pretty jarring.  You can hack around that by getting the text to auto-format and break lines up into screen lines, but there's all sorts of niggles with that (and FWIW, it causes some of its own problems, such as making it harder to search for phrases, because words may no longer be separated by just spaces but also possibly linebreaks).",1363848237

As a student, I worked at our school's environmental advocacy clinic. We called up politicians, bureaucrats, the media, etc, to drum up support for our cause. That's lobbying! Chris Dodd aside, that's the bread and butter of what lobbyists do--explain to intelligent but not technically-specialized public officials the mechanics of how specific issues work and paint a narrative for them that convinces them to care about the issue.<p>So yes, the tech industry needs more advocates. People who can engage in the political process and translate from the value systems of the tech industry to the language politicians understand: jobs, growth, votes. That doesn't have to mean huge campaign donations and a senator or two on the payroll (though those things help). It does mean developing a real base that cares about tech issues (and keeps caring about them!) and having dedicated, politically-saavy people willing to champion them.<p>Again, a comparison to the environmental movement is relevant. There are probably 100x as many (number I pulled out of a hat) people championing environmental causes as there are people championing tech causes. I know a number of very qualified people who opted out of private practice to work at environmental non-profits. Nearly every law school has an environmental law center where students participate in addressing local issues at the grass-roots level (things as mundane as nagging the City of Chicago to do better lead testing for its municipal water). Meanwhile out of all the lawyers I know with technical backgrounds (which is actually quite a few), approximately zero went to a non-profit to champion tech issues. There are some organizations that do great work on tech issues, like the EFF, but I'm not even joking when I say there are probably more environmental issues organizations in Chicago than there are tech issues organizations in the whole country.",1363847943

Even setting aside Adria's histrionics, we still have a situation where the online response was overwhelmingly out of proportion and either nobody did much in person or it was completely resolved in person, depending on which comments above were true. This stands in sharp contrast to the other five or six of these fiascos from the last year, where in nearly every case the offended parties tried to be polite and were shrugged off, told to get a sense of humor or not take things so seriously or told they should have been approached in private rather than publicly. In other words, this is the first fiasco we've had in recent memory where the response actually was out of proportionprior, NYC got napalmed because the bed bugs were still there after trying everything else.<p>I find it disingenuous to rewrite history from this single event to paint the sexism problem in our industry as being an overreaction by people who didn't speak up in person when this is really the only example of that.

5413307,comment,5413077,5413077,3,0,mdasen,,,"I think there's an easy solution to this: when one first launches Firefox (or another browser), it can prompt the user.  Firefox already has a ""know your rights"" thing that comes up.  Internet Explorer asks what search engine and other stuff you want to use.  Having a ""Do Not Track"" option as part of that would be reasonable.<p>As for Mozilla and this letter, Do Not Track isn't legislated.  Basically, it's a way for you to tell websites that you don't want to be tracked, but they have no obligation to follow your wishes.  Some advertisers [citation needed] have indicated that they will follow Do Not Track if it's an opt-in system.  A cursory search shows that Yahoo ignores the setting from IE10 because Microsoft made it a default (<a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/26/yahoo_to_ignore_ie10_do_not_track/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/26/yahoo_to_ignore_ie10...</a>).  As the article notes, the W3C says that Do Not Track should be opt-in.<p>So, on the one hand, advertisers seem to be saying ""if Do Not Track is a default setting, it isn't a user choice and we'll ignore it.""  If Mozilla makes it a default, it doesn't help anyone.  However, I think browser makers could call their bluff by making it a very apparent option when starting the web browser.<p>I think Do Not Track should be the norm.  However, it isn't.  The norm <i>is</i> tracking.  Once a norm has been established, it's hard to replace it with a new norm.  Cigarettes would never get approved for sale if they were invented/discovered today.  If subways were a new invention, it seems like they would be built with walls preventing people from being pushed onto the tracks.  But norms were established and it's hard to move away from them.<p>In this case, I think there's an easy solution: explicitly asking on first launch.  Browsers already ask to be the default, some try to tell you about rights, some ask you about search engines, etc.  Just add Do Not Track to that process.  Then we explicitly have a user opinion on the matter.",1363847098

5413245,comment,5412980,5412980,37,0,beloch,,,"I hate to break it to you, but Apple is very focused on increasing product turnover.  Every other PC and laptop vendor is going through rough times because the obsolescence curve on Windows PC's has gotten so slow to fall off.  A five year old PC can run Win8 (or Linux) pretty fine actually, so sales are in the scuppers.<p>Would you want to install Mountain Lion on a five-year old Mac?  Hell no!<p>Apple saw that hardware was starting to last longer and took steps.  Part of their solution was to try to innovate.  Retina screens, multi-touch trackpads and an increased focus on gestures to justify their use over mice, etc..  Another part was to drive costs, and prices, down.  Besides placing price pressure on the competition, occupying a lower price-bracket means people are more likely to upgrade more often rather than trying to nurse their old hardware along for as long as possible. This is the good.  The other parts of their attack on long obsolescence cycles are not so good.<p>All traces of easy upgradeability have left Apple's product line.  You now need special tools to get into pretty much any Apple laptop, and they use propriety connectors for everything.  Want to pop an off-the-shelf SSD into your Air?  Not gonna happen.  Yes, you can order Apple compatible parts and tools online, but this is not by Apple's design.  They'd probably sue those guys into oblivion if they were really doing a lot of business.<p>Apple laptops feel great in the hand, as if they're built to last generations, but they're actually horribly delicate in some respects.  The Air can be bricked by a mere drop of liquid in the wrong spot (this actually happened to me.  One drop.  I'm not kidding.).  The proprietary screws and integrated battery mean you can't remove the potential to stop the damage before it happens and then clean things up yourself. It's a horrible feeling watching your laptop fry itself knowing it could have been saved if it had been designed with a removeable battery.  You'll get no sympathy from Apple either.  Their warranty does not cover spill-damage.  When this happened to me, the repair bill was literally larger than what I paid for my air in the first place!   Subtle hint?<p>Software glitches and poor support for older hardware are only the latest in a long sequence of Apple's moves to keep you buying new hardware.  Have the geeks looked at your obsolete macbook, tsk'd, and subtly hinted that while you could continue suffering with that old beast, a new laptop would be very cheap and work much better!<p>Apple is not stupid.  They're actually really freakin' smart.  I'd be willing to bet OSX users replace their laptops, on average, more than twice as often as Linux or Windows users.",1363846061

Other recipients of these documents won't be so scrupulous about not posting sensitive information. I imagine Twitter is going through a lot of hassle around resetting security codes, reaching out to interview candidates, employees taking measures to protect identity theft, etc. Just a nightmare.<p>The other scary scenario is that this ""hacker croll"" has more documents which he hasn't shared yet.

But how to manage that profitably remains the tough question.<p>I've heard that music artists increasingly make more money from concerts etc than through their music, which is so readily copied / stolen. My business is very mindful of the value of our intellectual property (business frameworks to aid growth), but ultimately my clients pay mostly for their relationship with me / my team. Would giving away IP help attract more clients, or would it create competitors who would then undercut my relationships by competing on price?",1247640148

705275,comment,704976,705172,0,0,kragen,,,"I don't know if this is the case here, but often in benchmarking, ""min"" is the real answer of how fast something is going, and any time on top of that is some kind of overhead that you weren't trying to measure — some other process was taking up CPU time, you had to page in part of libc, crap like that. ""avg"" serves to tell you whether that overhead was reasonably small, or whether you need to run your tests again (on a quieter machine, say) to get a smaller ""min"".<p>This depends on the assumption that what you're measuring is actually a deterministic process.  There are cases where it's not; as an example, the Self papers have all kinds of moaning about the measurement imprecision caused by physically-mapped direct-mapped caches without OS page coloring, but with more than one page of cache, on old SPARCs.  For any particular logical→physical mapping, your measurements would be reproducible, but when it changed (if you got paged out and back in, or if you restarted the virtual machine in a new process) you would get different results.",1247639929

A hash index is perfectly useful for queries that return multiple rows: the index just stores all the duplicate values for the search predicate in the matching hash bucket. And hash indexes can certainly be used with aggregate functions: you first use the hash index to evaluate the query predicate (WHERE clause), and then you evaluate the aggregation or grouping clause over the results of the hash index.",1247639825

705267,comment,704092,704886,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>As opposed to a guess based on ignorance.</i><p>Nobody is arguing for ignorance. That's not an argument made in either the original post or in mine. The thesis is that what people call planning is usually guessing and should be treated as such, not that making informed decisions is bad, not that guessing is bad, and not that planning is bad.<p>You say planning is preparation, but preparation for what?  You are necessarily making predictions about what will happen in the future and what the appropriate course of action will be.  The ideas are inseparable.  Again: not that this is bad, but it is still guesswork--still map, not territory--and should be de-emphasized relative to dealing with the territory itself.<p>How much you devote to it depends on the costs associated with speculating on a course of action. Is this time spent planning going to save more time of work? Are the consequences of these possible situations worth the effort expended to prepare for them? If you're (say) coordinating hundreds of thousands of people to invade Europe, the cost of speculating and preparing is dwarfed by the cost of changing course to react to new developments. On the other end, especially when it's an individual or a small business, sometimes the cost of speculating on a course of action is higher than the cost of just putting it into practice.",1247639656

An external hash index is also designed to do as few I/Os per read as well (typically just a single I/O to read the page that holds the target bucket).

Pricing and positioning this and future aspects of our business model has been my focus for the past 8 months.<p>The value of Xobni is built on two pillars: search and relationship management.  This offering builds on that first pillar.  Future offerings will build on the other pillar.   We actually priced this offering below what we think was the optimal ARPU (average revenue per user).  We did that for 3 reasons (1) we want a huge % of users on this paid product - upselling to future offerings will be one-click easy (2) we believe paying users are more evangelical (humans justify decisions they've already made) (3) as a business in our stage we believe it is less risky to monetize a larger user group at a lower ARPU than very few users at a higher ARPU<p>We are optimizing for the 2-5 year revenue scenario (not 6 month scenario)  - in the not too distant future Xobni will be launching an enterprise offering, a blackberry application, and other premium offerings.

705257,comment,704979,704979,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>10% selectivity is the minimum selectivity necessary for a b-tree index to be helpful.</i><p>That's probably on the high side. Suppose that records are stored in 8KB pages (which is probably too small for a modern system, but nevermind), the selectivity of the scan is 10%, the records that satisfy the scan are randomly distributed over the pages, each page holds, say, 40 records (which is conservative, even for small 8KB pages), and we're considering scanning a secondary index[1].<p>That means that a typical page in the heap has 4 matching records, which means we are very likely to have to read every page in the heap anyway. Worst still, the order in which the index scan returns results is unlikely to correlate with the physical storage order of the heap pages, which means that the 4 IOs per page are going to be random, not sequential. Add to that, in a scan of a secondary index, you need to read both the index page and the pointed-to heap page, which is an additional I/O (compared to a sequential scan of the heap). So it's easy to construct a realistic scenario when you wouldn't want to use a secondary index when the scan selectivity is ""only"" 10%.<p>[1] And that an index-only plan can't be used: i.e. we need to fetch the pointed-to heap page.",1247638827

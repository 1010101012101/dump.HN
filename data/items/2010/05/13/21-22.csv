If it's something that makes sense to you and you can think algorithmically, you'll do fine no matter when you start.<p>I often encounter the assumption that all ""good"" programmers start early in life and/or that all ""good"" programmers have an innate drive to build things and that's why they got into programming in the first place.  (I think the two assumptions are related).  And while it's true that many good programmers meet those two criteria (probably the majority), they're not universally true.<p>There are other reasons to love programming besides just the end result; I myself was drawn to it because I'm fascinated by the intellectual challenge of taming and organizing complexity, and of the way program construction can be seen as a series of rapidly-evaluated scientific hypotheses (i.e. ""I think I can do X this way"" and a short while later, relative to pretty much any other discipline. you have confirmation or rejection of that hypothesis).<p>I did, however, leave school with a bit of a complex precisely because I don't fit the traditional grew-up-tinkering-with-computers mold for software engineers.  I thought that all those other people must be better than me, or be lightyears ahead of my skillset, or that because I came to the profession differently I must be somehow inferior or have a lower ceiling on my abilities.  It took me a couple of years of programming professionally to realize that wasn't the case and to be confident in my abilities.<p>Anyone with the right set of cognitive skills can do fine in a college CS program regardless of their background, and anyone who has the skills to make it through a college CS program and who enjoys what they're doing will do fine as a professional programmer if they're willing to keep learning, regardless of their prior background.  (And I don't mean to imply a CS program is by any means the only way to go, merely that someone with no prior background who goes through such a program will likely be fine.)",1273786127
1345753,comment,1343753,1345317,0,0,lincolnq,,,"""Normal"" git development (without rebasing) naturally creates a branching history when two people make changes based off a common root. As was explained above, rebasing causes this branching history to be rewritten into a linear one. The alternative is merging, where you cause Git to record what actually happened -- which is that two changes occurred simultaneously and you explicitly brought them in sync again.<p>Sometimes (often) this is what you want -- it's especially useful for longer-lived branches of work, where having the history of the branch can be valuable in itself.<p>Also, if you share a commit with someone, you can no longer safely rebase it! The reason is that part of the definition of a commit is its set of parents -- the commits it depends on (usually 1, but can be 2 or more for a merge commit). When you rebase, you are rewriting all the parents, so you end up creating a whole stream of new commits and discarding the old ones. If you then attempt to share history with someone who has the old ones, presumably Git will become confused. (I've never actually run into this problem, but I don't use rebasing much.)",1273786116

It reads like an optical Wittgenstein: a series of short, numbered observations about the way light and vision work that you'd never have thought of, but once you read, you can't stop noticing.<p>E.g.: you can always predict exactly where a rainbow will be, you can tell leaded glass at a glance, wire meshes only cast vertical shadows, the green flash is very real, sunsets look <i>exactly</i> like sunrises, you can navigate by a polarized lens, hills look steeper from above for the same reason that steeples look shorter than the shadows they cast on a cloud (related to the harvest moon), and the line of the sun on the ocean always points right to you. Have you ever noticed atmospheric perspective, or how drastically colors change with distance? You will after reading this book.<p>Minnaert makes some interesting claims about the harvest moon in particular. For example, lie on your back and look at the sky for a while: the flattened dome effect tends to wash out rather quickly, and the moon looks roughly the same size in any direction. He also claims that binocular vision is closely related to the perceptual flattening of the celestial dome, and one-eyed people do not perceive the harvest moon. I'm not sure if he's totally correct, but it's interesting to think about, isn't it?<p>It changed the way I look at the world.

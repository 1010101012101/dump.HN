In fact investors are so slow that even the most eager generally take around a week to put together a term sheet.  <p>My hope is that as t approaches infinity, demo day will approach an auction.  But t is still pretty far from infinity.",1186634795
40771,comment,40576,40603,0,0,staunch,,,"If he's talking about interpreted server-side code that's not very realistic. The third party has total physical access to the machine. It's pretty hard to have the code run and remain encrypted at all times -- impossible in most cases. The closest real thing you can do is obfuscate your code, which can make things painful for you as well.<p>If you're a US company and the third party is as well I'd just rely on copyright law for protection. If they're a foreign company it's more difficult.",1186634618
40770,comment,40472,40649,0,0,pg,,,"I think the reason men do less dramatic stuff after they have kids is not just that they don't need to impress women anymore.  After all, women also get less done after they have kids. The kids themselves are a big part of the reason both parents get less done.  Maybe the main reason.  And not just because they take up all their parents' time.  Once people have kids, they often think of their kids as the most important thing in the world.  And that means whatever project they were working on before is now at best number 2.",1186634465

40765,comment,40690,40690,0,0,david,,,"3. This one bugs me. It seems like smaller reddit type communities work best, but every social news site I've seen has only a few big feeds that the entire community has to use. I think the way to fix reddit/digg is to just open it up so anyone can create their own social news community, invite like-minded people (or not like-minded people, whatever they want), and have a mini-social-news site with stuff that interests everyone.<p>Then we could have social news sites follow kind of that same model that mailing lists and message boards and IRC channels do.<p>reddit has been saying for some time that they were going to allow user-created subreddits, but still haven't done it...",1186634176

I think that younger people have an advantage with this regard, but then again, those who are more ""tied down"" may take more time to analyze a market opportunity because there is more at risk.",1186634146
40763,comment,40412,40572,0,0,portLAN,,,"> pg was absolutely classy,<p>Definitely.<p>> and we really realized that YC was cheering for us even though we didn't get funding.<p>...Except I look more at actions than words.  In these days of a pool of billions of dollars being sunk into start-ups, if an investor won't put in $15k, that's pretty telling of their opinion.<p>(Yeah, I know, the value is in the advice, and their limited time is the deciding factor.  Still, investors who are <i>really</i> rooting for you will put their money where their mouth is.)  Acting nice is insurance in case you do turn out to be a big deal -- always keep your options open, don't burn your bridges, it's a small world, etc.

40761,comment,40472,40649,0,0,portLAN,,,"That's the thing about being young -- you can fool yourself into thinking that whatever form of scientific, artistic, programming, mathematical, or entrepreneurial achievement you're working on is ""really cool"" and going to get you some action. <p>Only one thing on that list actually works, and that's why so many guys are in bands... and why the Rolling Stones are still touring.

40760,comment,40690,40690,0,0,nickb,,,"Great questions!<p>1) No, I do not find Facebook relationships meaningful. I got sick of FB after I hit about 200 ""friends"". I ended up getting a ton of notifications & spam and it was all pointless. I'd rather spend an hour with someone over a beer than spend an hour going through messages on FB. So I gave up on it and never really missed it.<p>2) I don't watch TV period. I have no spare time and if I did, I'd spend it reading a book rather than vegetate in front of a TV (of any kind).<p>3)... no comment =)",1186633148

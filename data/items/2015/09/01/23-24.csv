It would be exploitative for them to pay below a reasonable wage because their employees have no other options for employment.<p>That is not the case for Uber in California and will likely not be the case in the future.  Uber mainly operates in heavily populated areas where alternative employment is available.  Additionally, Uber drivers are not geographically restricted in their employment by the nature of the job.  They have a car and drive all over town for Uber, so they would be able to find a job &quot;driving distance&quot; away from where they live.",1441151992

10156594,comment,10146892,10150984,0,0,niceguiman,,,"In order of your comments:<p>1.  In most cases, Google services are free to the user and leverage ads to cover the R&D and operational expenses of the service, and of course for profit.  The difference between that model and a device you purchase for what certainly appears to be a non-subsidised price seems pretty stark to me.  As a result, I balk at your blanket, unsupported statement such as &quot;This will no doubt be any different&quot;.  Are documents such as <a href=""https://support.google.com/onhub/answer/6246642?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/onhub/answer/6246642?hl=en</a> outright lies?  If so, please provide some citation or reason.<p>2.  HN is not an entity to whom I need to explain.  The accounts are throw-away by design.  It exists because HN requires I have an identity in order to operate in its context.  Requirement set.  Requirement met.  Here we are.  Freedom.<p>3.  I am sad to hear you found my comment &quot;minimal and non-contributing&quot;.  This concept has resurfaced in many conversations I&#x27;ve had in regard to this and similar topics.  Allow me to expand and hopefully add value.<p>I think of opposition to Google (or other corporate entities) as having two distinct brands:  people who consider them as adversaries and people who disagree with or dislike their business models.  The difference in my mind is that an adversary is an entity that is expected to be malicious and should only be trusted if bound by strong technical controls.  If you believe that Google is an adversary in this sense, then your position makes sense to me.  Deliberately avoiding Google&#x27;s products/services/devices is one of the very few technical controls available to you as a private citizen.  I disagree with your assessment, but the course of action you&#x27;re advocating is consistent with your world view. You can can hardly be blamed for discarding the policy I referred above as patently false.  That&#x27;s the long winded version of what I said.  Fair?<p>There is an alternative:  you disagree with Google&#x27;s business model, and don&#x27;t trust Google to act with your best intentions in mind.  It is not evil, but its actions may have effects you do not condone or expect.  Yet, from time to time it releases products/services/devices that solve some problem you have.  In that case, I&#x27;d argue that you can afford to operate in &quot;mixed mode&quot;, where you make decisions product by product based on some analysis.  This analysis could be something like auditing Google&#x27;s products where feasible (e.g. AOSP, CrOS, Chromium, etc.).  Hurrah for open source.  The demands this option places on you are quite high.  The return is comparatively low.  I claim the return is low because meaningful analysis requires a lot of time and less than common skills, and in return you may get a tool to solve some primitive problem (e.g. browse the web, make a call, send an email, etc).  I expect that the the vast majority of people will not go down this path.  Certainly nearly no one will review all post-facto software updates for adherence to initial audit criteria/standards.  Another flavor of &quot;analysis&quot; is to delegate the decision to trusted parties.  For example follow EFF&#x27;s recommendations to minimize risk. (e.g. HTTPS everywhere, Privacy Badger, and their &quot;Who Has Your Back&quot; reports, etc).  This approach scales quite well.  It allows the user to do some basic inspection (e.g. reading reviews, articles, maybe skim the source, etc) and make up their mind.  They feel informed, but are in fact removed from underlying details and reasoning.<p>The questions I have for you are as follows.  Which camp do you belong to?  If it&#x27;s the first, I&#x27;d be curious to understand why. Is Google your sole adversary or is Cisco/Juniper, Asus/Netgear, etc in the same boat?  They all play a role in mangling, mirroring, and forwarding your packets.  The vast majority of network devices are upgraded, patched, reconfigured without your input or knowledge.  Is that not a concern?  If not, why not?<p>If you&#x27;re a mixed mode sort, then why advocate a response tied to the more extreme position?  Also, unless you&#x27;ve done first hand analysis or can cite some, I don&#x27;t grasp how you could have arrived at your conclusions already.  OnHub code will be open sourced at some stage.  It can be audited.  You can even wait for someone to audit it and defer to them.  Why jump the gun and call to abandon ship?",1441151647
10156593,comment,10151566,10156246,0,0,patzerhacker,,,">But claiming someone has privilege isn&#x27;t a value judgement on the person, or a sin...Saying someone has privilege is just pointing out the state of the world, it isn&#x27;t a judgment.<p>That is exactly the same argument that bigots use when they talk about {minorities, poor people, immigrants, LGBT people}.  &quot;That person fits into category X, and everyone in category X shares some characteristic Y because they&#x27;re in that category.  I&#x27;m just saying that because it&#x27;s true!&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t matter who that generalization is made about, whether they&#x27;re the dominant group in society or not.  It&#x27;s still a terrible generalization and an intellectually lazy argument and in and of itself carries a judgement.  If you grant that something like &quot;white privilege&quot; or &quot;male privilege&quot; exists (and most people that buy into the concept do) then by that logic a homeless, illiterate white man has more privilege than a black woman millionaire CEO.<p>>People without food allergies have privilege in that they don&#x27;t have to constantly worry whether what they eat will kill them.<p>That&#x27;s absolute nonsense as well.  There exist people without food allergies that have other conditions where they constantly have to worry about what they eat, diabetes being an example.  So check your cis-gylcemic privilege you fascist!/s  Do you see how ridiculous and divisive that sounds?",1441151629

10156583,comment,10152867,10154719,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"DRM is dying.<p>CSS, AACS and HDCP are all broken, Flash is on its last legs and music downloads have largely abandoned it to positive consequences. Streams seem to be the last bastion, but that doesn&#x27;t even make sense -- the reason people subscribe to Netflix is to watch new content every month, not to watch the same content over and over. If they wanted to do that they would just buy the Blu-ray (or, if so inclined, pirate it once). And pirates have no reason to rip a 6Mbps stream when they can rip a 40Mbps Blu-ray.<p>DRM is a box you have to check when a suit was bamboozled by a DRM snake oil salesman into putting it in a contract. How the DRM works is irrelevant because it won&#x27;t actually work anyway. A fig leaf doesn&#x27;t need codec support.<p>That&#x27;s what EME is about, and that&#x27;s why you hear the free software people griping about it but not the actual pirates. EME makes piracy easier. It separates the DRM into its own little box which makes it easier to circumvent. Which is what the pirates will do because they don&#x27;t care about breaking the law, but which law-abiding free software people are proscribed from doing by DMCA 1201.<p>But the most fundamental flaw in your argument is that you misunderstand who decides what DRM gets used. DRM is not content. What gets supported is ultimately decided by the platform companies. When Apple says there will be no DRM on iTunes, <i>there will be no DRM on iTunes</i>. The only thing Disney or Universal can do about it is withhold their content, but that costs them more than it costs Apple or Google. Which means it isn&#x27;t something they can credibly threaten unless the dispute is of a make or break significance, and the particulars of DRM implementation are not on that level.",1441151511

(Amazon&#x27;s A/B testing is much more traditional split-testing, where they show one variant to half the population and one to another half and then pick the best one.)<p>The biggest problem is that many of the folks involved had encountered very surprising and counter-intuitive interactions between features, and because of that, they didn&#x27;t trust the textbook models.  For example, at one point we had a very convenient embedded-Python experimentation framework that let us rapidly try things out.  Our main data-scientist on the project decreed that we were not to use it, because a number of the externalities that framework introduced - higher latency, and potential error conditions - could confound the metrics in ways that were not well-understood at the time.  Data is useless unless you can trust that it actually represents reality.<p>Stats textbooks all make certain assumptions about reality when they present the models, and if reality doesn&#x27;t conform to the assumptions, the models won&#x27;t conform to reality.  Certain factors were well-studied enough that we could build useful models from them - that was the point of all the experimentation around color, after all.  (I wonder if those conclusions still hold, anyway: data has an expiration date, and I recall personally running an experiment that directly contradicted an experiment Marissa Mayer had run 6-8 years previously.)  But that requires a lot of hypothesis testing and verification: it&#x27;s never a matter of &quot;well, the model says so, therefore it must be&quot;, but rather &quot;well, the model says so, let&#x27;s run an experiment to see if the model&#x27;s predictions line up with reality, and if they do, we have a pretty strong - but not ironclad - indication that we can use it for future calculations.&quot;<p>tl;dr: Largest and best-funded social science program I&#x27;ve ever seen.",1441150741

In the degrees most relevant to Silicon Valley, engineering and computer science, it is 16%. The average is pulled up to 30% by much higher concentrations of women in physical sciences (40%), math and statistics (42%), and biology (58%).<p>16% of the engineering/CS degrees going to women lines up very nicely with the 15% he cites for the number of tech jobs in the Bay Area being held by women.<p>Many of the comparisons of Silicon Valley to national averages are comparing very different types of companies. For example, the comparison of executives is comparing to the S&P 100. I see no reason to expect that, say, a pharmaceutical company absent discrimination would be expected to have the same percentage of women executives as a computer software company absent discrimination.

You can also imagine an &quot;SSA&quot; category of a static single-assignment intermediate language of a compiler. Compilation would be a functor from C to SSA. Likewise you can consider an (endo)functor from C to C which turns a function from direct style to CPS, and then run the compiler to get SSA. You can then ask is the SSA generated in both steps the same &quot;semantically&quot;. Actually proving that in all its gory detail is simplified by making the right setup as explicated by user tel and then applying the Yoneda lemma at the right moment to conclude the proof.<p>More interestingly you can ask questions like does an SSA optimisation, an (endo)functor on SSA correspond to some optimisation in C that could be a source-to-source transform.<p>Etc, etc.<p>The purpose of mathematical abstraction is simplification, even though it may transmogrify the concrete into a seemingly unpalatable form.",1441149693
10156476,comment,10151566,10151566,0,0,ghufran_syed,,,"This entire thread is the most amazing Rorsach test, on the basis of the flimsiest data. Many of the points made in the comments may be true, but it&#x27;s a disappointing for a HN thread to have so much impassioned comment but so little critical analysis of the underlying data.<p>The first issue worth noting is that the definition of &#x27;employed&#x27;(not discussed in the article or the original paper) vs self-employed incorporated vs self-employed non-incorporated are based on self-reporting from the census [5]:<p>&quot;CURRENT OR MOST RECENT JOB ACTIVITY. Describe clearly this person’s chief job activity or business last week. If this person had more than one job, describe the one at which this person worked the most hours. If this person had no job or business last week, give information for his/her last job or business.<p>Mark (X) ONE box. \n- an employee of a PRIVATE FOR-PROFIT company or business, or of an individual, for wages, salary, or commissions?  \n... several other answers elided...\n- SELF-EMPLOYED in own INCORPORATED business, professional practice, or farm?\n- SELF-EMPLOYED in own INCORPORATED business, professional practice, or farm?&quot;<p>So if you are getting a salary from your startup, do you think there might be some ambiguity about which one you tick? If you are working at company A, but working on your startup on evenings and weekends, you would mark &#x27;employed&#x27; if you followed the instructions.<p>Once you understand where the data came from, you might not infer the same meaning to the underlying paper, whose abstract is here:\n&quot;We disaggregate the self-employed into incorporated and unincorporated to distinguish between &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; and other business owners. We show that the incorporated self-employed and their businesses engage in activities that demand comparatively strong nonroutine cognitive abilities, while the unincorporated and their firms perform tasks demanding relatively strong manual skills. The incorporated self-employed have distinct cognitive and noncognitive traits. Besides tending to be white, male, and come from higher-income families, the incorporated—as teenagers—typically scored higher on learning aptitude tests, had greater self-esteem, and engaged in more disruptive, illicit activities. The combination of &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;illicit&quot; tendencies as youths accounts for both entry into entrepreneurship and the comparative earnings of entrepreneurs. In contrast to past research, we find that entrepreneurs earn much more per hour than their salaried and unincorporated counterparts.&quot;<p>So they are using &#x27;incorporated&#x27; as a proxy for entrepreneur, by comparing them with &#x27;unincorporated self employed&#x27;. Let&#x27;s see if that makes sense, and if their &#x27;entrepreneur&#x27; is the same as what we might call a &#x27;startup founder&#x27;:<p>- The ratio of unincorporated to incorporated is 2:1 (approx 10 million vs 5 million in 2009 [1])<p>- The SBA says 600,000 new ventures are started each year (that they know about) [2]<p>- There are around 70000 angel deals in one year (2013) [3]<p>- There are about 4000 venture deals in one year (2014) [4]<p>We can probably agree that the angel and venture deals are &#x27;real&#x27; startup entrepreneurs. Some small indeterminate proportion of the incorporated and unincorporated self-employed probably are too. However, doesn&#x27;t it seem a little silly to analyze the 5 <i>million</i> incorporated self-employed vs the 10 <i>million</i> non-incorporated self-employed, and assume it&#x27;s telling you anything about <i>start-up entrepreneurs</i> ?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2010/09/art2full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2010/09/art2full.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_Sept_2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_Sept_2012.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/data/Documents/Resources/ACA-AngelBackground2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/data/Documents/Resour...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://nvca.org/?ddownload=1868"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvca.org/?ddownload=1868</a> (2015 NVCA Yearbook)<p>[5] <a href=""http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaires/2015/quest15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/ques...</a><p>Edited to fix formatting issues",1441149691

If society depends on something, we regulate it. There are many different possible degrees of regulation, so this is not a boolean condition, even though painting such situations as a boolean choice between pure laissez-faire and <i>nationalizing</i> an industry (instead of merely regulating).<p>If you don&#x27;t like this idea, I suggest that Google (or any other business) should find a way on their own to handle the situation (possibly by making their metrics more available, transparent, <i>and verifiable</i>?), or the choice may eventually be taken out of their hands.",1441148513

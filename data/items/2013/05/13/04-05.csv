5697164,comment,5695070,5697003,2,0,graycat,,,"Well, apparently Plenty of Fish did it!<p>So, for a first answer to your question, have to\n'plan', that is, think of a Web site that can\nattract that much traffic, at least from publicity,\nviral effects, other network effects, happy users,\netc.<p>How to do that?  Well one way is just to think of a\n'business idea' (John Doerr said that business ideas\nare easy and plentiful; bad business ideas are;\nmaybe good ones are more difficult and rare!),\ndevelop a prototype, use 'lean' methodology and/or\nthe Steve Blank approach of continually 'iterating'\nwith the customers and revising the prototype to\nachieve 'product/market fit', 'pivot' if this\ndoesn't work well, and keep trying.<p>I have another approach in mind borrowed from\nproject planning examples going back over 100 years.\nA joke version is, a good recipe for rabbit stew\nstarts out, first catch a rabbit!  More seriously\nthink of what one venture partner calls a ""big ass""\nproblem.  I would add detail:  Want a problem that\nis 'big' in the sense that we are sure that the\nfirst good or a much better solution will be a very\nvaluable 'must have' and not merely a 'nice to\nhave'.  To keep risk down, want no doubt about this.\nIf there is any doubt, pick another problem.\nAnother local, mobile, social, sharing app has too\nmuch doubt.  Similarly for another 'social graph'\nrecommendation site.  From all I can see, mobile\npayments also have too much risk from regulations\nand need for 'critical mass'; if try this, then be\nready to jump quickly on the first good acquisition\noffer.<p>The obvious example of such a ""big ass"" problem,\nalthough not from information technology, is a safe,\neffective, inexpensive, patentable one pill cure for\nany cancer.  Then don't have to worry about\n'product/market fit'.  Instead, a sad reality and\nnot at all a joke, have to hire security guards to\nkeep desperate customers from breaking down the\ndoors to the lab and trying to steal the pills.  Why\ndon't we have such a pill?  No one knows how to make\none.  But the first person or group that figures out\nhow to make one and patents it will have a low risk,\nfirst good or much better very valuable solution and\na very successful business.<p>So, right, we are getting a hint:  For the success\nwe want, it might help to do some original research!<p>So, for step (1), think of a suitable ""big ass""\nproblem.<p>Step(2).  For this ""big ass"" problem, want to find\nthe first good or much better solution that will\nclearly be a very valuable 'must have'.  For the\nvery valuable part, in part want a barrier to entry.\nFor a cancer pill, could use patents.  For\ninformation technology might use Fred Wilson's\n""large network of engaged users"" (but apparently now\nhe is moving into mobile payments instead!), a\nnetwork effect (everyone uses it because everyone\nelse uses it, e.g., LinkedIn; nice to have; usually\ntough to get started), a brand name, etc.  Or have a\ntechnological barrier to entry, that is, have a\nsolution too difficult to duplicate or equal.  The\ncommon claim that there is nothing new to permit\nsuch is just not true.  Uh, the technology might be\noriginal and not on the shelves of the research\nlibraries -- right, that's commonly called\n'research' and venture capital won't fund it,\nevaluate it, review it, or even think about it and\ninstead will throw it into the bit bucket because\ntheir backgrounds in bizdev, marketing, and selling\nmade them afraid and jealous of it; also they want\nalways to be ""the smartest guys in the room"" which\nraises a risk of the other guys not being smart\nenough to make money!<p>So, to get this solution, do something different for\nrecent information technology entrepreneurship but\nnearly standard for much of engineering going back\nover 100 years:<p>For our step (2), faithfully convert the real\nproblem into a mathematical problem, e.g., as in the\napplied mathematics in each of most of the fields of\nengineering.<p>E.g., notice that the wings don't fall off Boeing\n747 airplanes.  Why?  A major part of the reason is\nthe applied mathematics of mechanical engineering.<p>So, from our step (2), we now have a clearly\nstated mathematical problem.<p>Although we are in information technology, notice I\ndidn't say we have a computer science problem.\nWe're talking applied math, complete with theorems\nand proofs and possibly with some advanced pure math\nprerequisites, common in engineering going back over\n100 years, e.g., to Maxwell's equations, but\nrecently rare in information technology startups.<p>Step (3).  Get a solid mathematical solution to the\nmathematical problem.  Have two advantages here: (A)\nGenerally it is relatively easy to check such math\nfor math correctness.  So, get lower project risk.\n(B) The math approach can yield solution techniques\nmore powerful and too difficult to think of\notherwise.  So, get a better shot at the first good\nor much better valuable solution with a\ntechnological barrier to entry.<p>Step (4).  Write software to do the data\nmanipulations specified by the mathematical\nsolution.  There are two advantages here: (A) The\nmath really should provide a\nprecise, usually succinct,\nspecification of\nwhat the software needs to do.  E.g., we\nare not trying\nto write an 'artificial intelligence' application\nbased on, say, 'rules' and Forgy's RETE algorithm\nwhere have to keep 'tweaking' the rules until they\nappear to work, i.e., keep throwing the software\nagainst the wall to see if it appears to stick.\nWe\ndon't have to keep trying maximum likelihood\nestimation of 'machine learning' to see if it\nappears to stick.  Similarly for neural networks.\nInstead, if the software just does the data\nmanipulations specified by the prior math, then\nlikely the software is essentially correct, has done\nits job.  So we lower project risk.  And such\nsoftware tends to be easier to write than the\ncommon, elaborate user interface software.  (B) Such\nsoftware is relatively easy to check for correctness\nbecause of the fundamental advantage that we have a\nprecise, and usually succinct, specification of what\nthe software is supposed to do (the lack of such a\nspecification is the main problem in establishing\nsoftware correctness).<p>Step (5).  Deploy the solution.  Get publicity.\nLikely have built into the problem specification\nthat want a lot of virality.<p>The steps (2) through (4) typically are\nchallenging and high risk.  But there are two\nadvantages: (A) Typically these steps can be done\nessentially just on paper, e.g., as an applied math\nPh.D. dissertation or engineering project planning\ndocument.  And, as for most applied math research,\nthe work usually needs just one person.  So, the\ncost, 'burn rate', is low.  (B) The work, the\napplied math and software, are relatively easy to\ncheck for correctness thus lowering project risk.<p>If can't get through the fourth step, then return to\nstep (1) and another problem.<p>Back to step (1), picking the big ass problem:\nHere definitely want no doubt.  But 'social' is not\nwell understood so that for highly 'social'\napplications we will usually have too much doubt.<p>More generally this 'way' of doing projects won't\nwork for all projects and would not have worked for\nall successful projects in the past.  Right.  But\nthe intention that, once step (4) had been completed\nsuccessfully, the 'way' gives high financial return\nat low risk for an appropriate project and enough,\nbroadly, to get the business progress we have in\nmind.<p>So, that's the plan to get the page views!",1368418622

Any law school that refused to participate should be rightly viewed with suspicion.<p>The point is that it doesn't matter what the scale is.  Just that it be comparable between schools.",1368417883

While that's not quite as slow as the public internet, it's possible some of those applications could fare well with increased parallelism to make up for public internet connectivity.<p>Bitcoin's computational power numbers aren't relevant for another reason though: it's entirely confined to computing sha256, and only in a special way...",1368417876

Unfortunately, if I want to go to another grad school or apply to non-law jobs, they will look at this and not understand. Undergrad transcripts are riddled with high As due to grade inflation, but they see the law transcript and think you're mediocre because you only got one A in 3 years.",1368417845

One suggestion:<p>1) Put the thread reply text field at the top of the comments and show new replies at the top, at least for the user who made the comment.<p>2) Replying anywhere else should require clicking on Reply under that comment.<p>This makes it intuitively clear that thread replies are not replies to a thread comment.<p>This would take users some time to adjust to, but should fix the problem.<p>I know at least one site that does this. Ahem.<p>EDIT: Looking more carefully at the second screen shot, it looks like they did this. Seems like a non-issue in that case. The first screenshot for some reason doesn't have that change. Who knows if they are A/B testing or what. Strange that the OP did not notice this difference.",1368417810

What you're talking about is data refinement. As you said, linking things together and trying to look at your data in different contexts and dimensions than what you do normally. This can be done on a nearly any data set small or large. Big data gets into the realm of literally having so much data to process that data refinement becomes nearly impossible without a significant combination of thinkers, doers, machinery and money.",1368417774

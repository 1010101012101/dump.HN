When I got DSL I chose ATT because they offered 20 MB storage, only to find that you could not actually have a simple, static website. They hashed the filenames upon upload AND each time you edited online, so it was really storage only.<p>These days even a static website can be jazzed up nicely with some JQuery and/or HTML5.

We have been looking at this issue in particular lately. \nThere are a few ways we can beef up login security, but the bottom line is that it&#x27;s a balance between that security and the inconvenience of lost login names. Many, many, people forget their logins, and this makes it easy to retrieve. This is more of a problem with accounts that you log into once a year or two, like registrars (Hint: use password storage software!). \nThat being said, we are actively working on a more convenient way to configure logins to provide security than this legacy method.

In my case there&#x27;s no real reason to do that, because the foreign tax credit I get for my Danish taxes zeroes out my US tax liability.

Meditation is observing and (hopefully gently) directing your mental focus.<p>Try it sometime for 10-20 minutes. Sit down someplace quiet, close your eyes, and choose some very simple thought to focus on. Try to keep your mind from flailing about. It&#x27;s <i>incredibly</i> difficult. There&#x27;s absolutely no way I could make it through a 10 day exercise like this without guidance.<p>Some people do this for specific purposes such as working out a problem that they&#x27;re having, or just promoting attentiveness, and sometimes it&#x27;s just a matter of exercising general discipline so that other discipline will follow outside of meditation.<p>In support of my original comment, this is the easiest place I&#x27;ve found to apply the lens of metaphor.

If you just think of these terms in the context of focus - the intensity, oscillation, and well, flow of focus, it gets a lot easier to accept.<p>Edit:<p>To answer your &quot;what types of guidance&quot; question directly, there are all kinds of non leading guidance to be given. Simple examples include &quot;sit someplace comfortable,&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t feel guilty should your mind start to wander.&quot;",1372438285

Interestingly enough, the peaks you list are nowhere near Firefox 4&#x27;s release date (March 2011), while Google&#x27;s advertising for Chrome began near those points [1]. Both StatCounter and Net Applications show this trend (decline after Q4 2009).<p>Whether or not StatCounter or Net Applications is more accurate is an argument I don&#x27;t want to pursue (page views vs unique visitors, country weighting to remove bias vs no weighting to preserve data integrity, etc.).<p>> I know many others share this opinion, as well.

Essentially you&#x27;re not allowed to do anything that would distract you (or others) from meditating, and that&#x27;s it. (E.g. you&#x27;re not allowed to talk with others or eat junk food, as with most similar programs.) The teachings obviously come from a certain sect of buddhism, but that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re there. Yes, Goenka does make some counterintuitive claims about the underlying nature of the universe, but the basis for those claims are phenomenological experiences that people have had while meditating; they come from the same set of experiences that you yourself will have if you stick with it.<p>There are certainly a few aspects that are less than ideal, e.g. there isn&#x27;t really any way to get medical advice if you need it apart from just quitting the program. But other than that it&#x27;s hard to complain. It&#x27;s free, the food is amazing, the quality of instruction is very high, the people are great, etc.",1372437030

At the lowest end of the spectrum are the widgets containing information from within the network. That&#x27;s a reasonable way to direct users from a Web site into a network (eg. a user visiting a newspaper&#x27;s site may go and visit the newspaper&#x27;s Facebook page) but it&#x27;s useless at getting people from the network to go to a site. Nobody goes to Bob&#x27;s Web site to check his Facebook status; they do it from within Facebook.<p>The situations where this can work well are:\n1) Consumer APIs with machine-readable results. The simplest mashup, data visualisation, interactive game, etc. can be made really interesting when it has real-world data to play with. As an example, one of my first programs was a balls-on-springs physics simulation, but I drove it with artist similarity data from last.fm (audioscrobbler at the time).\n2) Producer APIs allow data to persist once the static page is closed.

Once the program started to take over 20 minutes to complete I decided to look into improving performance. Making the code run use both my CPUs in parallel was trivial.

You may not speak out against the Commander in Chief, you may not be a part of &quot;extremist&quot; political groups (extremist is defined as what your command says it is), you may not participate in many types of demonstrations. You can of course vote however you please.<p>#2 You are explicitly ordered not to obey unlawful orders and there is a process in place for refusing to follow an unlawful order. If you refuse to follow what you believe to be an unlawful order then you had better hope you are right because if you just feel you are right by the UCMJ and you are in fact not then your life will become miserable.<p>#3 Being in the military is a day job that bleeds over into many other areas of your life, the computer systems at work contain lots of sensitive information, things that you might find mundane. If you are deployed you may find it convenient to use a computer on NIPR in the TOC for personal use. Use that gov&#x27;t hardware wrong and you can get in deep doo-doo. As a soldier I&#x27;d be happy to know they&#x27;re helping me not do things on their hardware that would get me in trouble.<p>#4 Each soldier signs agreements to follow the rules around classified information, including not reading documents they do not have clearance to read.<p>#5 Being a good soldier requires shouldering an immense amount of responsibility without the frivolity of youthful indignation. In combat arms especially attitude and indignation get people killed. Indignation is reserved for private citizens, so use it on their behalf but don&#x27;t expect them to rise up in defense of themselves.<p>#6 If a soldier is truly being wronged he or she knows they can go to IG, and if IG isn&#x27;t working out they can write a letter to a congressperson and things will actually happen.<p>#7 If you think the way the military works is ridiculous, I understand, but don&#x27;t assume that you know better. The military exists to kill people and break things not further social agendas (right or wrong). Most rules and regulations are written in blood, meaning someone had to die or get hurt, or some major loss of expensive or sensitive hardware happened to create that rule which you are ordered to follow.<p>#8 Most of your comments sound ridiculous to me (as a soldier), it&#x27;s a different world with a different set of &quot;BIG PROBLEMS&quot; to deal with and you really don&#x27;t understand it.",1372435484

Actually the chromebook pixel and the htc one are the only two devices off late which had this effect on me.",1372435397

5958682,comment,5957850,5958528,4,0,alan_cx,,,"Yup, I agree. Same sort of thing where people put down the use of things like Dreamweaver, claiming note pad is better. Same mentality, I think. And even though I would argue logically for Dreamweaver, I would still sort of feel the notepad advocates had a point. Yeah, typing feels more &quot;real&quot;, even more exciting.<p>I then think is it a generational thing? But only yesterday was I sat there on that genetic car racing site watching live as people tried to hack the chat box. Command line again. I assume these were kids. Yet there they were in 2013 excitedly hacking away using the keyboard.<p>To tangent even more.... That was great to watch. Kids (I assume) excitedly trying to hack the chat box, by typing stuff, while the admins updated and updated them away. A wonderful race and frankly a joy to watch. YES hacking and defacing is bad, it even pissed me off to start with, but then I realised that there was something so energetic, or alive, about it. It was like sort of watching life or something. It reminded me of one of those movies where we see the &quot;geek hero&quot; furiously typing away at a terminal trying to stop a nuke launch or some such. Dunno how to describe it really. Anyway, the admins won easily and quickly, and that&#x27;s as it should be.<p>Edit: All that waffle and I forgot the point...<p>Basically, those kids reminded me of back in the day. I guess the spirit me and the OP were talking about. So, IMHO, it is still alive. Heh, unless such kids end up in US jails....",1372435382

I hated the chanting, the obvious eastern cultural bias (an overzealous assistant told me not to point my feet at the TV while GoenkaHeadroom was talking), the vague conservative morality, the claims to nonsectarianness while still referencing reincarnation, etc.  But the technique really works, and the gestalt of their teaching method does work, and I was, also, literally a different person than when I went in.<p>I&#x27;ll say this for the chanting: by the time it starts up at about minute 55, it is the sweetest sound you can possibly imagine.",1372435376

There haven&#x27;t been intelligence abuses because this is all legal to do, and the laws are publicly available knowledge if anyone would care to look.<p>If the issue is people think some of these things should be illegal, then the challenge is to get the appropriate legislation changed. But if you&#x27;re only champions are people who think foreign intelligence should be shutdown altogether (as Snowden has been moving his message towards), you&#x27;re not going to get very far (because it&#x27;s an obviously stupid idea).",1372435344

There might be a question where you have to provide a model that makes the logical formula come out as true or false - the sort of question which has an infinity of possible answers.<p>They never follow the particular method I suggest for working through these which would lead them to the simplest answer in each case (usually a model with only one object in the domain).  Yet, somehow, one paper after another, they all come up with the exact same model, with the same number of objects in the domain, the same extensions... everything.<p>So they all just copy from one another.  One student complained to me this year that a large group of them were copying answers from one another right in front of the office where they have to submit papers.  Largely the university can't do much more than turn a blind eye - for without absolutely concrete evidence the students can (and often do) sue, and win.",1289731894

And even in that extreme case there are still choices, just not very many happy endings.<p>There are plenty of scientists that would do the most unethical things if it means they get to work on their pet project.<p>From that wikipedia article you quote there:<p>""We knew that we had created a new means of warfare, and the question as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else. We wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured.""<p>The hypocrisy in there is so thick it's almost comical.",1289731775

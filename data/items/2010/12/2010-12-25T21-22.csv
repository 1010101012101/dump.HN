For example, what if you knew of a treatment for diabetes or AIDS that could benefit others? Wouldn't you feel the need to tell others with diabetes and AIDS rather than leaving them to stumble across it on their own?<p>Likewise, we feel that the morals and lifestyle we advocate are beneficial and can help many improve their lives. Therefore we want to tell other people about it. At that point other people can either say ""I don't like it and don't want to hear about it,"" or ""I like it and want to find out more.""<p>I'm sorry you have had some bad experiences with Witnesses visiting your door in the past. Naturally there are unbalanced and insulting Jehovah's Witnesses just as there are unbalanced and insulting atheists. People differ. However, I can assure you that every Jehovah's Witness is encouraged to be very respectful and polite about sharing his/her beliefs and listening to the beliefs of others. Some people's personality traits aren't up to par, but we can't stop them from going out and talking to others. Remember that every Jehovah's Witness is a volunteer so naturally some of these volunteers are going to be good, and some of them aren't going to be so good.<p>If you experience someone who seems rude or confrontational you can tell them to leave your door, or you could get their name and complain to the local congregation (using the phone number in the local phone book). Somebody will probably talk to them and ask them to please be more polite.<p>At any rate if you would like to try a decent, two sided conversation about religion or the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses feel free to contact me:<p><a href=""http://about.me/nathanpeck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://about.me/nathanpeck</a>",1293313938

This is why Elastic Block storage is  two to three orders of magnitude slower than SSD attached to a server in your garage.  1 EC2 compute unit is analagous to a 1.6 Ghz 2005 Opteron, or performance wise it's similar to a fast Atom processor.    I can build a 4 core server with 8 Gigs of RAM and 120GB of SSD and 2 TB of spinning disk for around $600.    SSD latencies are low enough that they can be thought of as slow local memory.<p>So, for the cost of a  3 to 4 months of medium / large instance EC2 instances, you can have roughly 8 times the processing power and 2 orders of magnitude more local memory/SSD.<p>By setting up a couple of cheap servers in my garage, I can get as much processing power as 20 to 30 EC2 instances.

2039438,comment,2039029,2039150,0,0,samdk,,,"It really is very good advice, and installing Ruby/RubyGems through the package manager is almost never a good idea (<i>especially</i> on Debian-based distros) for several reasons.<p>Ruby is a language that moves very, very quickly. On ""cutting-edge"" distros like Fedora and Arch it's not nearly as much of an issue, but not having to wait to get new language versions is very convenient.<p>More importantly, though, is that the version of RubyGems distributed through Debian's (and Debian descendents like Ubuntu's) package repositories is crippled. Gem normally includes a very important command called 'gem update --system' that lets you upgrade gem itself. The opinion of the Debian package maintainers is that all upgrades should be handled through the package manager. This makes sense from a system administration perspective, but it's a huge pain when you're trying to do Ruby development, because important gems like Rails often require a fairly new version of RubyGems. (And Ruby libraries get updated much more frequently than the language itself.)<p>For the above reasons, doing Ruby stuff on Debian/Ubuntu without using RVM is a huge pain. Even if you manage to get everything working, an update to gem or something else may break it a week later.<p>While RVM isn't <i>as</i> essential on other distros (like Fedora, which I did Ruby dev on for a long time before learning about RVM), it's still massively convenient. You can ensure that you have a consistent development environment across computers and operating systems (which I find is especially useful when deploying to a server, since I use different Linux distros for everyday use than I do for hosting things), you can easily switch between Ruby versions (I have one project still on 1.8.7, and I do the rest of my stuff on 1.9.x--switching between them is as simple as typing <i>rvm $VERSION</i>), and it deals with all of the icky bits of managing multiple versions of gems (to go with your multiple versions of Ruby) for you.<p>RVM is awesome, and makes lots of the headaches that surround Ruby development go away. Use it.",1293312682

It is just that the culture of Jehovah's Witnesses is one of self-sufficiency without overwork. We don't see the value in working long hours and overtime to make lots of money when it is possible to live a self-sufficient and enjoyable life with a medium to low income.<p>Jehovah's Witnesses definitely do visit people's homes here in the U.S, and some people are certainly annoyed by that, but one possibly little known fact is that if you tell a Witness that you don't ever want them to come back we'll add you to a ""Do Not Call List"". If you are really irritated by our visits you can easily stop them.<p>I certainly don't feel that we are a ""pyramidal sect"". We are a sect in the definition that our beliefs differ from those of the dominant world religions, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Pyramidal would imply that some members are better than others or that we have some complex structure that oppresses the common member in favor of an elite class of members. On the contrary I can assure you that every member is treated equally. Naturally some members who are better at coordinating things take the lead in organizing functions and operations but these individuals are not assumed to be better than any other member, and there are no extra perks, pay, or glory going to these volunteers.<p>I'm not sure why you would not be seeing someone after they became a Jehovah's Witness. I know that the Russian government has put major pressure on JW's in violation of their own laws on freedom of religion and as a result local JW's may find it beneficial to maintain a low profile. Another possible explanation is that after becoming JW's many choose to stop associating with former friends who they find to be living lifestyles which are immoral and who they feel might be a bad influence.<p>As for ""dropping your job"" the only case where I can think of a Jehovah's Witness leaving their employment because they were a Witness would be a situation in which the person was working in the army, or in some industry directly connected to immoral activity.<p>At any rate I'm sorry that you see the ministry work being done in Russia as ""spam"", and ""annoying"". We just want to give you free reading material that you can consider and compare with your own beliefs. If you don't like it, tell us and we'll leave you alone. If you do like it, tell us and we'll be happy to explain more to you.<p>In my mind there are tremendous advantages to being well informed and learning about alternative cultures, so I am willing to consider ideas and reading material from numerous sources. In the end, I am the one who makes the decision about how to live my life. Jehovah's Witnesses feel that we have a very beneficial way of life that others can benefit from, so we advocate it. Why not have a serious talk with a Jehovah's Witness?<p>In the worst case scenario we are just crazy people and you wasted your time talking to us.

Have user locally install apps-with-web-frontends on the desktop. Use P2P technologies for communication between the apps.<p>2. Have user locally install apps with native UIs.

8201582,comment,8198481,8199906,1,0,pi-err,,,"Surprised by the hate - didn&#x27;t suppose people were so attached to the Roman Empire. So:<p>- Sanitation: &quot;invented&quot; in India, perfected in the middle east and imported to Rome from there<p>- Medicine: aryuvedic, greek, chinese and babylonian medicine all eclipse Rome&#x27;s. The Empire definitely did not invent anything there. Lookup Hippocrates for a big founder.<p>- Education: also a Greek and Egyptian tradition.<p>- Wine: strange claim. &quot;Invented&quot; as far back as Neolithic. Massively used in Greece. Rome improved the way wine barrels can be reused.<p>- Public order: not sure what you mean. There was order and dense cities before the Empire. Codified political systems and local law enforcement as well. If the &quot;city&quot; order is your point, then Rome and Babylon are &quot;inventors&quot;.<p>- Irrigation: like most others, Rome imported fertile crescent know-how. Zero roman invention.<p>- Roads: the technology for smooth, paved roads existed before Rome in most middle-east. What Rome brought is empire-wide cheap labor and strategic need for straight lines (legions move faster). You could compare it to high speed rail today. Did France &quot;invent&quot; it, or did it get most clues from Japan? Most roman roads, being actually built for the military and not for trade, were abandoned quickly because they were too steep for long-distance cargo.<p>- Fresh water system: water supply in urban area has not been invented in Rome, imported as well. Like roads, cheap labor and cheap capital turned existing tech into massive, continental infrastructure<p>- public health: like therms and public baths? Common in the whole mediterranean world (still today).<p>---<p>In comparison, the Mediterranean world before Rome discovered within a few centuries:\n- the pulley<p>- the screw<p>- the water mill (greek invention just before roman conquest. The windmill was invented later on in Europe during the &quot;middle ages&quot;)<p>- cement (also greek-born)<p>- millstone (india)<p>Were the Romans great engineers? Yes. For instance they brought together cement and arch technology to build some of the larger structures of that time.<p>Yet the Roman empire a time of great inventions? No. Few innovators in tech and abstraction. Ptolemy was egyptian. Archimedes was actually killed by the Romans when captured.<p>--<p>@vacri and others below: where did I say &quot;roman republic&quot;? I only mentioned the Roman Empire. A deeply flawed regime built on clientelism and which survived through a flow of capital from new territorial extension towards the insiders. It was indeed crazy archaic - the integration of religions, private interests and decision making is hard to imagine to modern minds. For centuries, the Emperor actually fed a large part of the capital, paid by capital inflow from new conquests, with many critical decisions taken upon Omen interpretation <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augury"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augury</a><p>I know how much love there is in the US for roman law -- but roman empire?

In each case, it feels like it&#x27;s all about linking one big advancement to the next big advancement.<p>What you get from Jason&#x27;s documentaries and presentations and sites however, is this really raw and honest look at what real people were actually doing at the time.

It&#x27;s also fun to think about the remarkable advances in things like geared devices, automatons and water wheels in the Hellenistic period through to the end of the Western Empire. Most famously the Antikythera device: <a href=""http://hist.science.online.fr/antikythera/MORE-DOCS/Greek%20Gears%20Plasma%20Seminar%208-31-071.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hist.science.online.fr/antikythera/MORE-DOCS/Greek%20...</a><p>It&#x27;s tantalizing to imagine the next steps from these sorts of devices, like windmills, clocks, programmable mechanical looms, steam power, etc. Given the quality of the engineering in the Antikythera mechanism, it might have been within the technological abilities of Greco-Roman society to develop a classical era version of industrialization. Of course, then you get into the whole debate about whether a slave society has an economic impetus to industrialize (I think they do, following Sidney Mintz&#x27;s point in &quot;Sweetness and Power&quot; that Caribbean sugar plantations in the 18th century were proto-industrial, factory-like spaces, but that&#x27;s another discussion).",1408523191

Consistency of quality is pretty random as well.<p>So you have to make sure you inspect the goods before you take them.\nAlso, almost all manufacturers and distributors will make you pay before at the latest at the time the goods are departing. No 60 day or 120 days credit here.<p>You get the cash, you get the goods, most of the time.<p>If you&#x27;re a larger trading company, you can have the support needed to inspect and ensure that the goods are up-to-spec.<p>Then there is Alibaba.

At least you have buyer protection and the sellers are very careful about maintaining their reputation so they are usually prompt and efficient.<p>Finding a factory for something you want to manufacture (or for large orders) can be fraught with issues, the first of which is that I&#x27;m yet to find a factory that can honestly tell me they can&#x27;t do something; whatever you ask, you&#x27;ll get a &quot;yes&quot;.

Think Occam&#x27;s razor - you would need massive political pull to put this in every tiny jurisdiction, not to mention equipment maintenance and the massive attack vector exposed by hundreds of &quot;internet of things&quot; devices piping data to some endpoint. The recognition results would need to be geolocated, time tagged, and encrypted to NSA specs. To access the data it would have to go through some kind of unclass->classified firewall, get decrypted AND they would have to keep the public in the dark, blah blah blah.<p>The tools <i>already revealed</i> for large scale surveillance are cheaper, more effective, and more robust to outside attack than the mentioned ideas. More importantly, they are <i>already there</i> - there is no rollout cost at all! And up until recently it was also easier to keep the public in the dark...<p>I <i>do</i> see applications at the places you mention, but for a very different reason - border inspections (coupled with human oversight) are an excellent place for automation where a small amount of effort could lead to a massive increase in throughput per person.<p>The only downside is that officials who deploy these things will want <i>guarantees</i> on effectiveness, which you can never truly give due to statistics. Couple this with the fact that neural networks are very difficult to tune for false negatives and false positives and it would be a difficult sell.<p>One alternative would be to use these types of networks as black-box preprocessing, followed by a &quot;tunable&quot; algorithm like logistic regression where you could effectively control the ratio of false positives - a high rate of false positives coupled with human oversight could still lead to a large boost in human performance if most of the border inspection process is uninteresting.<p>But still there are unions... which is a whole separate issue to itself.",1408522495

What&#x27;s not mentioned here is that it came out in the trial that Schmeiser had very deliberately infringed the patent by using Roundup to select the Roundup-Ready plants, saving their seed and planting them separately. Schmeiser made a very good job of rousing the media in his support, but he definitively broke the law.<p>I&#x27;m sorry you find his story inconvenient to your Monsanto cheerleading, but I (and I feel many others) don&#x27;t think this should have violated any law. Someone contaminated his property with Roundup-Ready canola. He chose to take advantage of that, isolate it, and replant it. <i>He</i> never agreed with anybody to not do this, or signed contracts to control what he does with what ends up on <i>his</i> property.<p>The idea that a patent can exist on a lifeform is utter nonsense to me; I think a lot of the outrage comes in discovering that Monsanto&#x27;s patent is on the actual lifeforms themselves, not on the process for turning a regular seed into a roundup-ready seed.",1394999875

7410956,comment,7410519,7410838,4,0,hibikir,,,"Even without terminator seeds, replanting seed that you harvested is not necessarily a good idea. For instance, most commercial corn seeds are hybrids, made by crossing two highly inbred plants. This means that the seeds in the bag have pretty much the same DNA as each other. Those plants produce far better than their inbred parents, and they are quite predictable in most agronomic ways.<p>Now, what happens when you get the next generation? When Hybrids cross with hybrids, the actual genetic makeup of the offspring will produce quite a bit more variation. With that increased variation, come less average yields. So even if a farmer didn&#x27;t sign anything that would stop him from planting the seeds, chances are that a farmer would have higher profits by just buying a bag of seed anyway.<p>Not so much for Soybeans though, but that really is a place where Monsanto has pretty much a monopoly: Roundup protection increases yields so much that non-GMO soybeans are barely planted, because they are far less profitable for the farmer.",1394999837

But I am no expert.<p>But compare it to a corporation that has a patent on some computer code which would distribute itself as a worm and every victim with an infected PC has to pay to the corporation. Only because you have it on your PC does not make you a copyright pirate. There must be clear evidence that you downloaded patented software willingly.

Already, many apps such as Tinder ask for your FB account and import your photos.

This place shouldn&#x27;t be a centralized social network, it should be an open-source server.<p>In this way, people can upload and manage their own videos, photos, and more.

For an example local to me, the Australian developer/mall operator Westfields has formed a joint venture with another developer to combine two local malls and redevelop them into one huge mall, which make Westfields 3rd huge mall in London:<p><a href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/croydon-westfield-set-to-go-ahead-after-planners-support-1bn-scheme-8963792.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/croydon-westfield-set-...</a><p>Maybe large parts of the US just has too many/too large ones, given how many of them were developed pre-online shopping.

If the mall owner does not actively manage changes due to changes in the surrounding area, it can easily become obsolete as a whole.",1394998571

There is a trend in public health to move away from educating the populace and towards regulation, especially food distribution and composition. Regulating industry can affect food consumption much more dramatically than attempting to get people to change their behavior voluntarily.<p>But I don&#x27;t think enough people are examining the recommendations themselves, and demanding very good science to back up the advice.

Monsanto are a real pain in my ass as a plant scientist because they&#x27;re nucleating an all-out war on rationality. The original Monsanto, a chemical manufacturer, were hated because of their US government contracts for Agent Orange, and their massive environmental abuses in the 1950s. In the 90s they developed some nice genetic technology. In 2000 that company was bought out by Pharmacia. Then, in possibly the biggest PR fuckup ever, a newly formed company taking only the agricultural IP from the old Monsanto decided to <i>keep the name</i>. The name carries so many associations with the evil things they did in the 50s-70s that it has utterly polluted the public discourse on GM crops.<p>It&#x27;s also very tiresome to have Percy Schmeiser trotted out over and over again. What&#x27;s not mentioned here is that it came out in the trial that Schmeiser had very deliberately infringed the patent by using Roundup to select the Roundup-Ready plants, saving their seed and planting them separately.

By eliminating individual identities (except on a few niche boards, almost nobody posts in any identifiable way) from a group, you are left with no way to form personal cliques.<p>You can identify people by their actions, sure. Like &quot;that person who draws those video-games comics&quot; or &quot;that person who knows a lot about kernel development and posts help in the programming threads&quot; (this is a hypothetical person, I haven&#x27;t met one like that on 4chan yet) &c. But you don&#x27;t have a name on those usually and even if they do use one, those people only use it to post that content, rather than in general. You don&#x27;t know if the person is male, female, or a raptor butterfly from Venus.<p>The threads are also flat and you cannot upvote posts. This prevents the upvote-echo-chamber effect you can see on reddit. If you wish to drown out another opinion, you have to actually post more than the other anon, you can&#x27;t just call your friends on IRC and have them upvote via puppet accounts or whatnot. And there is an enforced minimum time between posts, which is greatly increased if you attempt to post the same thing twice in a row. Every dissenting opinion is given equal opportunity for being heard (as long as it&#x27;s not about posting gore pics out of sheer asshattery - that shit gets you banned).<p>This does sound very unstructured and some kinds of groups do arise, but they&#x27;re centered around shared interests and not identities. It&#x27;s kind of strange putting it like that, but 4chan is probably one of the sites on the internet where it&#x27;s hardest to hurt a specific person. You can post hurtful remarks about some other person&#x27;s post or opinions, but without an identity to attach to that person, you can&#x27;t go on to hurt them in other threads. Or even in the same thread in many cases. Now, there are people on certain boards that voice general opinions that will hurt you and make you angry. I suggest posting right back at them.<p>4chan&#x27;s design won&#x27;t work in all cases, though. For instance, StackOverflow and friends work perfectly with the reddit model.

Princeton was the only one (IIRC) that offered all its financial aid in the form of grants (no loans). In that sense, it has the most undergraduate-friendly financial aid process.<p>HOWEVER, &quot;demonstrated financial need&quot; is a murky term, and I have seen it be abused in practice, at all of these schools. An unfortunate consequence is that it can create a &quot;doughnut hole&quot; - the burden often falls on people who are <i>just above</i> the line that the school draws for financial aid[1].<p>This can hurt the middle class families who have enough money not to qualify for the same level of financial aid, but not enough to pay for the college without significant financial pain[2].<p>Of course, the schools often have little incentive to solve this, because the &quot;significant financial pain&quot; that these families feel takes the form of either private student loans (which the students pay for later), or subsidized federal loans (which are subsidized by taxpayers).<p>So, costs keep going up and up. I saw a graph recently that compared the tuition (and also tuition + other expenses) of private education compared to inflation, and it was staggering.<p>[0] They all <i>also</i> have an agreement not to provide any merit-based scholarships (only need-based).<p>[1] It&#x27;s usually stepwise, not a single line, but the same idea holds<p>[2] The &quot;demonstrated financial need&quot; can also be very easily abused by the affluent. I know one student who received very heavy financial aid, despite her family being incredibly well-off. I can&#x27;t remember, but I think they structured their assets and income on paper so that it looked like their daughter was an &quot;independent&quot; payer.

7410689,comment,7408576,7409286,5,0,pcwalton,,,"> We keep hearing about how Rust 1.0 is supposedly going to be released sometime later this year. Yet instead of seeing things stabilize, we&#x27;re still seeing breaking changes like the one mentioned here. It starts to make some people skeptical about when Rust will actually be seriously usable.<p>It&#x27;s better to get the breaking changes out of the way <i>soon</i> rather than delay them to later. We intentionally front-load all breaking changes precisely <i>because</i> we want stability soon; that is why there are so many of them recently.<p>You keep posting this same exact comment over and over in every Mozilla-related thread (even ones unrelated to Rust), without any more evidence that Rust is not headed toward stability.",1394996649

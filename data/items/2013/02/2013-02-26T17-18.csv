If your doing a CS corse without BCS accreditation everyone knows it will be a bit suspect.<p>However, the BCS you've probably never heard of, they aren't exactly at the forefront of anything, they are also quite stuck in the past.<p>In a world where dynamic or at the very least JIT'd languages are the norm, teaching Pascal or Delphi I really doubt is in the best interests of the students.  Yet in 2003 that is what I was taught for first year.<p>So the idea that a CS graduate will be able to go in to software development immediately is a bit missleading.  It's more a case of someone who has a CS degree will have demonstrated they have the aptitude to become a software dev.<p>tl,dr: its education, not training.",1361901542

Im really excited about this opportunity and thought Id turn to this community and ask for advice.<p>Background on me: I sold my first small company at 15, and started my first start-up company my sophomore year of high school. Im a great networker and have great connections with investors and entrepreneurs in the Valley. Im one of the youngest founders ever to speak at SXSW and love technology/start-up companies (enough bragging)
I'm getting ready to graduate high school and want to explore a few alternatives before I jump back into school. I'm planning on taking my first semester off from college to pursue opportunities that are on the table for me right now (which might not be available after college).<p>If you ask me which career I would like to pursue, I would not have a direct answer. I know him still some-what young, and want to work with start-ups, Im a great iOS/web (UI/UX) designer, and hope to take the venture capital/angel investor route someday.<p>I would love to hear your advice or comments on this opportunity or if your company/venture capital firm is looking to hire an associate intern/mobile designer.<p>Thanks!",1361901473

</code></pre>
Before I learned that command, I'd seen git as a backup tool with some scary options for manipulating history that I didn't want to touch for fear they'd blow up on me. After learning about git reflog, I finally understood that this was like being scared of pressing backspace on the keyboard. Yes, it can erase commits you really really needed--but all you need to do to get them back is:<p><pre><code>    git reflog
</code></pre>
(to find the commit hash you want to get back to), then<p><pre><code>    git reset --hard ${old commit hash}
</code></pre>
to get to it.<p>Now, without any reason to fear experimentation, I can use git like it's meant to be used. I can edit my local history without fear, then push it to the remote repo.<p>(One reason to still stay slightly cautious--some git commands run garbage collection automatically, and garbage collection will destroy any disconnected commits. Running ""git config --global gc.auto 0"" will fix this--I prefer to manage the garbage collection myself anyway, personally.)",1361901202

Looking at the current BCPL compiler code, it seems that it does now allow { } for section brackets, but the comments in the compiler suggest that it wasn't added until 1995.  BCPL's section brackets were neat in that you could add a label to them and they would be parsed much like HTML tags.  I think it's likely that B introduced the curly brackets in lieu of BCPL-style section brackets and omitted tagged brackets altogether, then B begat C, etc.",1361900236

This does not sound logical to me.<p>Your problem is with definition of ""trade"" and ""hoarding"". If you rephrase your statements using words ""buying"" and ""selling"", then it'll be clear why you create a paradox.<p>When people ""trade"" they are doing an exchange: one buys coins for a product, another one buys product for coins. If the demand for coins grows, buyers of coins will compete between each other to offer more of their products for coins. Hence the growth of the coin price in terms of other products.<p>But the trade (or ""hoarding"") can only happen if someone is willing to sell, right? So the actual exchange (at any price) will happen only where people are selling coins.<p>The trade does not happen continually, it is discrete. In the night people sleep and do not trade. And when trade occurs, it is instantaneous. 100% of time money and products simply stay on someone's account.<p>If at some point everyone expects price to rise and nobody sells, no trade occurs. But still everybody is willing to buy at the last known price. What can we say about price without recent trade? Nothing - we only know last price from yesterday (or last week). Do coins suddenly lose all their value since nobody is trading? No, because people are still willing to buy.<p>When a single seller expects that the price will not grow further, but there are real products to buy for coins (since everyone is still willing to buy), he will sell his coins and establish a new price. Maybe the same as yesterday, or lower. And the market will find another price. Maybe lower, maybe higher.<p>Please point out logical problems in my statement before repeating that ""no trade means no utility and total collapse"".",1361900187

The second part, the ability to think, is a skill that people must have AND use in their everyday life to be successful in whatever they do. Zuck, Gates, Dorsey, Houston, etc. are all encouraging people to learn to code for this reason, and because programming is an extremely empowering skill--not just in one field but in all...if you want it to be. The fact that programming can be used in all fields is why there is such a huge push for people to learn. It is a self and world-empowering tool that is simply being encouraged to be taught/learned by the incoming generation.<p>The current generation needs to realize that programming exists everywhere, just as we are taught that subjects like math, biology, chemistry, physics, and history are. There is a HUGE distinction between learning to code just for the sake of getting a job or improving the economy and learning to code because it can empower us to THINK and then DO. Not to be philosophical, but part of societies' problems has been always knowing what problems exist, but not actually doing anything to solve it--until now. Programming, more than anything, accelerates our ability to solve problems, little or big.<p>In a world where so many problems exist, programming is many times the means to achieving the solution. And that is why these successful programmers are pushing everyone to learn.",1361899286

It's certainly hit a chord with me.<p>I went to a secondary school (ages 10-14, first half of high school?) where the senior teachers gave the speeches about a ""Zero-Tolerance Approach to Bullying!"" and how they had only had three cases of bullying in the last few years. They lied, cooked the figures and redefined bullying to cases of systematic physical abuse which was rare. Because they did have a zero-tolerance policy towards violence.<p>I have two sets of parents, my dad and then my mum and step-mum. Starting secondary school someone found this out and like a lot of people suggested here when they tried to use it to verbally abuse me I exacted violence against him. Not wanting it to explode into something more, the school kept it very quiet and I didn't get punished, but neither did he. Instead, if he ever told anyone else what happened or about my parents he'd get off scott free. To his defense no-one found out for three and a half years. Instead, I got three and a half years of verbal abuse, the little physical things one can get away with in corridors, my possessions taken and hidden. Some teachers tried to help but there is only so much they can do when most of them don't care. ""Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will break them for you"" is something I remember hearing from a sympathetic teacher.<p>Then one day, it suddenly became common knowledge. I found myself faced with what felt like a third of the school who wanted to see me beaten. Fortunately, I appeared to be the only person who didn't know this was going to happen, there were almost as many if not more people behind me (and quickly, around me) who were adamant that I was going to be okay. The next six months were basically hell. Then as the natural progression of things, I shifted schools to a school that had a teacher who kept everyone in line and looked after those who needed help, be they the abused or the abuser. I was lucky in that I found a support network that let me rebuild myself and my self-esteem after. I am who I am despite, not because, of what I've been through. Even if there are still days where I have to look a little closer at the mirror to remind myself of that.",1361898775

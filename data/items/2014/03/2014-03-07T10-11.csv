7359560,comment,7358792,7359343,3,0,GuiA,,,"I think a deeper issue is that a lot of nerds (term that I use here broadly to define people who grew up using usenet, BBS&#x27;es, wrote/contributed to the open source tools that power most of the internet, etc.) have a strong sense of ownership when it comes to the internet, and feel strongly about respecting netiquette (which includes not doxing people unless there&#x27;s a crime underneath with extremely strong evidence, like for example when that teenager posted a video of himself torturing a cat on YouTube). It&#x27;s pretty telling that acts like that are typically frowned upon even by websites where morals don&#x27;t fly very high (e.g. 4chan).<p>Sadly, a lot of people who are foreign to that internet culture (like the Megan McGrath who penned the Newsweek article) aren&#x27;t aware of these implied rules, or, if they are, they just don&#x27;t care about it.",1394189981

7359545,comment,7355449,7356273,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"I don&#x27;t follow what you mean by &quot;the actual historical reason&quot;. The article clearly indicates that 1 went through a long period of not being commonly considered a prime (for bad reasons), then a brief period of being commonly considered a prime (for bad reasons), and is now once more not considered a prime (for good reasons). It calls out the reason why we switched to the current view as being, at the very least, extremely closely related to the reason you&#x27;re claiming is not &quot;the historical reason&quot;.<p>Your parent comment is correct (or so close that I think correcting them is a bigger mistake); that is the reason 1 is not prime. We don&#x27;t consider 1 &quot;not prime&quot; as an accident of history, we have the knowledge now to make an informed decision. The &quot;historical reason&quot; has fallen by the wayside.<p>This is related, by the way, to the question of 0! (zero factorial). By definition, it&#x27;s 1. The most obvious reason for that is that it fills a bunch of different holes in various formulae that use factorials (Taylor series, virtually any combinatoric formula...). But that&#x27;s an extremely instrumentalist approach. Is there any reason why we might predict that 0! = 1 without knowing in advance from combinatorics that we&#x27;d really like it to be the case?<p>Sure. What happens if we multiply together the first zero positive integers? Obviously, we get the empty product: 1. Hence the definitions I learned, where a prime number has exactly one factor (not two), and 1 has zero, not enough to be prime.",1394189515

Investor comes in and wants 20%. You would issue him 50 shares and that would dilute your percentage to 80%. Total shares issued now is 250 shares.<p>Your shares don&#x27;t change and you don&#x27;t just get issued new shares. That&#x27;s why in startups people reference actual shares of stock rather than percentages. Percentages is just a way for people to communicate. That said, in an actual startup we&#x27;re talking about tens of thousands to millions of shares initially rather than this dumb down version.<p>As for why your version isn&#x27;t always the case, it&#x27;s obvious that if everyone shares get increase accordingly, and retain their percentage ownership, there&#x27;d be no new shares/percentage going to new investors of employees",1394186836

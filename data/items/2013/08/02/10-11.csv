I would consider it unlikely that there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> at least one way to do calculations on a modern CPU that results in arbitrarily-tunable EM emissions roughly in the radio (or wi-fi, or bluetooth, or...) band. Giving access to a <i>screen</i> makes this even easier; those emit EM <i>by default</i>.",1375441152

So we don&#x27;t know, and won&#x27;t until society has matured to the point we can face these questions.<p>(I understand what little evidence we have points to maternal health/diet/wellbeing as the single biggest causal factor. Handouts of food - or simply money - to mothers in the latter part of pregnancy are the most effective intervention we know.

6146312,comment,6145261,6145261,6,0,MarkCancellieri,,,"Long-term behavior-change is extremely difficult, but the strategy that I have been experimenting with recently and having success with is context-sensitive rules (commonly called &quot;implementation intentions&quot; by behavioral researchers). The form of these rules is &quot;if-then,&quot; although I often phrase them in a way such that the &quot;if-then&quot; is implied.<p>For example, like you, I was procrastinating far too much at work. This was driven mainly by two problems: 1) I&#x27;m somewhat addicted to the Internet, and 2) there are many things with my job that I&#x27;m either bored with or just uncomfortable doing. The result was that I would procrastinate by going on the Internet.<p>I finally decided to make a rule: &quot;No non-work-related Internet at work.&quot; Or in the &quot;if-then&quot; format: &quot;If I am at work, then I will not use the Internet for non-work purposes.&quot;<p>This rule has worked for me. It forced me to confront the discomfort that I was having with the task at hand. I also try to focus on completing only one particularly challenging or distasteful task that I have been procrastinating on per day, and I try to do it first thing in the morning. The positive feeling that it generates is amazing.<p>I have adopted other rules as well, such as to lose fat. I have a rule to only eat during an 8-hour feeding window from 12PM to 8PM (intermittent fasting). While I am at work, I also only eat a huge mixed salad (with grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs, and tuna salad) every single day. I don&#x27;t allow myself to use the vending machine or to eat goodies that people bring in or eat pizza on Fridays (pizza day). When I&#x27;m not at work, I&#x27;m a little more flexible.<p>I try not to design rules that expect me to be perfect all day every day. My rules are designed in a way that help me to be perfect only during specific contexts.<p>I think the reason that setting rules for ourselves is so often successful is because it eliminates the need to make decisions. Every time you allow yourself to make a decision, you give yourself the opportunity to make a <i>bad</i> decision, which you <i>will</i> do at times of low willpower, which pretty much everyone goes through (willpower is an exhaustible resource).<p>So my recommendation is to try to design some context-sensitive rules (i.e. rules that you will follow at certain times or certain places) and adapt them as necessary so that they work for you. Remind of yourself that your rules will make your life better and that you are free to change them if you find that they don&#x27;t serve you, or else your brain might rebel at the perception of the pain of discipline.<p>If your rules take a lot of willpower, they will eventually fail guaranteed.",1375441114

OTOH, if you go out and play football (or something you&#x27;ve been practising for years), and manage to score many goals for your team leading to victory, would you enjoy the activity?<p>Your discontentment arises from a simple mismatch between what you want to do and what you are actually doing.

One big clue is that collagen fibers in skin and bone are piezoelectric. So when you &quot;tap&quot; on a acupuncture point or puncture the skin around it with a needle, an electric charge is created. It is also well established that there is less electrical resistance between acupuncture points on the skin than other. Those acupuncture points form daisy chains that connect with every organ in the body.\nFirst time I saw an acupuncture meridian chart I thought &quot;this is an electrical diagram!&quot;.\nIf you want to go deeper down the rabbit hole I recommend, for starters, the book &quot;The Body Electric&quot; by Dr. Robert O&#x27; Becker. It&#x27;s a classic on the subject.",1375439566

And learning to look objectivly on yourself and accept that you fuck things up from time to time. Don&#x27;t say that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m lazy or that is because of X. Just note that you are doing something you know it is bad. And try to accept that. It&#x27;s easier to deal with it.<p>Things that helped me (that you could try before going down the military route):<p>Heavy exercise (running 10km a day, martial arts training 2-3x a week). This is probably related to fear - without that level of exercise I&#x27;m feeling unable to even start with other habit forming activities. As others noted it&#x27;s tough to keep sticking to it.<p>Meditation/Relaxation: Medition is pretty hard for me. But doing relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation or even yoga and then vipassana makes a difference for me. Never works without the heavy exercise for me through.<p>As far as I remember when I was able to implement these 2 habits for a longer period of time everything else worked quite well or at least I was able to work on the issues. E.g. facing long worn in fears, structering your day. Learning to plan. Actually long term planning.<p>If the level of stress or fear rises, everything breaks apart for me through. It&#x27;s been a pattern for some years now.<p>Also: Get some real friends, not people that talk only about their great ideas for apps with you but that are honest to themselves and also struggle with life. I&#x27;m always feeling that a lot of my issues are superficial when I&#x27;m around other people that are working on their problems. It keeps you grounded and gives you motivation. Maybe.<p>Actually I don&#x27;t have a solution. But if you want to feel better about yourself exercise and meditation worked for me.",1375439413

Regulating the market drives the prices way down (you could have retail prices for a brick of coke that are the same as that of a package of coffee if you&#x27;d let the market work unrestrained), which causes people to not have to resort to crime to fund their habits.<p>(note: not advocating unregulated heroin or cocaine markets, just stating the obvious socio-economic implications of prices within the bounds of affordability for regular people with a regular job, leaving aside their ability to do said job)",1375437648

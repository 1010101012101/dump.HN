He founded the site and has written the essays that have struck some resonance with most of the users and drawn them here.  They upmod him a lot.  What else would you expect?",1208433002

It is easy to replicate the computer technology, but not the social aspect of the site.<p>Except that eBay has stopped innovating (in either the technical or the human/social part of their technology), while Facebook is constantly trying new things.",1208432500

166234,comment,165905,165905,0,0,mbleigh,,,"While I strongly believe that an engineering school is going to give one a much stronger CS foundation, what ultimately was most important in my undergrad and after was doggedly pursuing internship and real-world experience opportunities. Of course, going to a good engineering school will mean these opportunities are more readily available.<p>If you work hard at it, you could have nearly four years of relevant industry experience by the time you graduate from college, making you a much more attractive candidate to a company compared to contemporaries who have no practical experience.",1208431739

The attackers ended up DDOSing themselves. When they set the DNS back properly, for some reason the attackers had stopped. I guess they felt too ashamed to try again!<p>EDIT: It might also be possible, of course, to blacklist certain IPs and force those to be redirected to their localhost.",1208431108

6868302,comment,6868098,6868098,1,0,jamestnz,,,"This got me thinking, as I have many primary-school clients (&quot;K-6&quot; schools) making extensive use of Google Apps for Education to give the students access to various services like gmail, drive, sites, blogger.<p>So I just did a search, and found the following question and answer on productforums.google.com[1] from 2009...<p>Question:<p><i>We currently have Google Apps Education in our school. Our teachers in the elementary and middle school have expressed a great interest in using Google Docs in the classroom. I read on the web that there is a age restriction of 13. Is there anything in the terms of service that indicates this and what is Google&#x27;s position on using Google docs in  k-5 classrooms.</i><p>Answer:<p><i>If you are using Google Docs within Google Apps Education Edition for your school domain, your school assumes the responsibility for complying with COPPA and the information that students submit. When offering online services to children under 13, schools must be cognizant of Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  COPPA is a regulation that requires parental consent for the online collection of information about users under 13.  Per the Google Apps Education Edition Agreement, any school administering Google Apps Education Edition acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compliance with COPPA, including, but not limited to, obtaining parental consent concerning collection of students&#x27; personal information used in connection with the provisioning and use of the Services by the Customer and End Users.</i><p><i>Parental consent and notification could take place in form of a permission slip granting use of Google Apps and/or other technology services at the school. For more information on complying with COPPA see the FTC&#x27;s website at www.ftc.gov/coppa.</i><p>EDIT:<p>From [2], google have also said:<p><i>Asking for age information helps us provide features like age-appropriate settings to our users, who are interacting more every day with the people they know. Under our policies, Google doesn’t allow users who are under the age of 13 to have Google Accounts, unless they are using Google Apps for Education accounts through their school. This is similar to a lot of online services, as it&#x27;s very complicated for many providers to offer better solutions for children that meet the relevant regulations.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-education/K2PJEQyl754"" rel=""nofollow"">http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-educati...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hey-google-thanks-for-making-my-daughter-cry/2011/12/12/gIQAhYx9pO_blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hey-google...</a>",1386460560

6868249,comment,6867072,6868137,13,0,ISL,,,"My apologies for the terse nature of my summary above. We measure the deflection of light bounced from a mirror attached to a test mass hanging from a very fine wire.<p>That said, the geometry of some of the Texas Instruments DLP MEMS chips has interested some of us for years. The chips are designed to be robust in consumer products, but if they instead designed their mirrors to have very soft springs, we&#x27;d be interested in playing with them. Once a year or so, I do a survey of the available MEMS accelerometer chips to see if it&#x27;s worth building an array from them. They&#x27;re still a few orders of magnitude away in sensitivity from anything we could put to use.<p>For the second half of your question:  Physicists do indeed measure interactions at scales far smaller than the diameter of a proton. The &quot;trouble&quot; with gravity is that it&#x27;s so very weak. On a handwavy charge-for-charge basis, gravity is 10^40 (that&#x27;s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) times weaker than electromagnetism. For an experiment that&#x27;s purely sensitive to electromagnetism (atomic spectroscopy) or other comparably strong forces (particle colliders) to see gravity, it&#x27;s necessary to resolve the other forces incredibly well in order to see a tiny residual effect from gravity.<p>For our work, achieving sensitivity to gravity at the scale of tens of microns isn&#x27;t that hard. Proving to you that we&#x27;re not seeing another force/experimental influence (the flip side of that 10^40) is very hard, and is what I spend almost all of my time trying to do.<p>Thanks for your interest; it&#x27;s sharing the stoke about this stuff that keeps us going when it&#x27;s hard (and, if you&#x27;re a US citizen, you&#x27;re paying for it!

He cites a paper that directly contradict what he&#x27;s saying.<p>2. a) He cites a paper to ostensibly support his theory that patent offices are pro-individual, but the reference actually says, without paraphrasing, &quot;The patent laws do very little to prompt this view.&quot; It actually concludes that the lone-inventor rhetoric &quot;has done little to stave off the increasingly anti-individual-inventor changes in substantive patent law.&quot;<p>2. b) He perpetuates the same &quot;Watt stopped Steam&quot; myth that Boldrin and Levine make. And to support this, he cites the Turner/Selgin paper that asserts precisely the opposite!<p>3. Further, regarding steam, he insinuates patent law didn&#x27;t work as expected because Watt&#x27;s patents promoted steam research by forcing workarounds. In fact, innovation through forced workaround has long been a known (though possibly post-facto) rationalization of the patent system.<p>4. All the examples  he gives of &quot;multiple independent invention&quot; are actually examples of multiple individuals independently inventing <i>different</i> inventions. And he further proves it by saying that many of those inventors secured patents for their own inventions as well!<p>5. All the other parties working on the &quot;genius&quot; inventions did contribute to overall knowledge, but a) their work was not wasted since they did things differently, exploring the problem space further, and frequently got their own patents, and b) those inventions that ended up being remembered as genius were actually the commercially more successful ones, typically because they were either technically superior or their inventors were sharper businessmen.<p>6. He implies accidental inventions are less deserving of protection, completely omitting that those inventions all happened in labs or research environments by people who were actively experimenting.<p>Throughout this paper, Lemley consistently makes two mistakes:<p>* He conflates the broad “idea” of something with the specific implementation that makes that something work;<p>* He conflates popular narrative about patents with the patent system;<p>And based on these two, he enumerates flaws in <i>popular narrative</i> where most major inventions were not invented only by those that got all the credit.<p>And then he completely fails to show how this flawed narrative has anything to do with the patent system, which, by his very own examples, does reward individual and incremental contributions.",1386458749

Lets look at the classical version, suppose there is a red billiard ball at the middle of a billiard table. I shoot a white ball, such that one ball ends up in the upper left pocket and the other ball in the upper right. Then the state space is white ball in the left pocket and red ball in the right pocket or the white ball in the right pocket and the red ball in the left pocket. Because of momentum conservation it is impossible to have both balls in the same pocket and billiard balls also do not spontaneously change their color. So the moment I do look at one ball, I know the color of the other. It is exactly the same thing with &#x27;quantum entanglement,&#x27; some conservation law demands that certain outcomes are impossible, and therefore the possible states of the system are restricted compared to a &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; configuration. ( In the billiard example, I put one ball in one pocket. And then roll a dice two determine where to put the second.) But on the other hand, claiming that entanglement is somehow &#x27;bizarre&#x27; lends itself to a Einstein quote. And we know that Einstein quotes are the pinnacle of modern science journalism.<p>[Edit] The parentheses are misleading. I mentioned a dice as a shorthand for arbitrary, not to imply that it has anything to do with some quantum process. So the point is, that in the classical case I follow a specific process, which leads to outcomes which are restricted compared to the case where I just put the billiard balls into arbitrary pockets.",1386458684

6868136,comment,6866916,6866916,4,0,mtdewcmu,,,"The stack is a concept that&#x27;s built into the CPU to handle function calls. Every time you call a function, there is a return address that needs to be stored. Since you need to hang on to a return address for every function that is currently in progress, and you use them in the reverse order that they were stored, what you need is exactly a stack. The stack is usually (always?) located at the top of memory and grows down. In addition to return addresses, it can be used to store data associated with an in-progress function, like arguments, local variables, and cpu state data that needs to be temporarily stored.<p>So that&#x27;s the stack. The concept of the heap, on the other hand, isn&#x27;t built into the CPU, and is sort of a vague abstraction implemented by programming languages. The first thing to know about how it differs from the stack: it&#x27;s not a stack. Stack reads and writes follow LIFO; reads and writes to the heap can potentially be in any order. The heap is usually (always?) located close to the bottom of memory, and grows up. So the stack and heap grow toward each other. At the lowest level, the heap is basically just memory that can be used as the application sees fit. Data on the heap isn&#x27;t inherently tied to an in-progress function call, so it can last indefinitely (at least, until the process ends). The programming language or the C library typically provide a means to subdivide the heap memory into discrete blocks as needed in response to an explicit or implicit memory allocation request (e.g. malloc(), new), and keep track of what memory is available and what is currently allocated.<p>Differences between the stack and the heap:<p>* the stack is limited in size, so it is easy to overflow and crash if you try to store too much data there. the heap, in contrast, is designed to grow as much as needed\n* the stack is managed primarily by instructions built into the cpu. the heap is managed by library calls and system calls\n* the difference in speed between the two refers to the speed of allocating or freeing a chunk. the stack can inherently do this quickly, because the location for the memory is predetermined. since the heap can do allocations and deallocations in any order, finding memory for blocks is inherently more complicated and slower.\n* since the fundamental purpose of the stack is to store data about in-progress functions, it follows that every executing thread has its own stack and usually only accesses its own. the heap, on the other hand, has no association to a thread of execution, which consequently means that multiple threads can share the same heap, and locking and synchronization must come into play when the heap metadata has to change. The locking is typically transparent, but the net result is to make allocations and deallocations even slower in threaded code.",1386458065

Every variant is in every person.<p>Another important point is that its latent phase is just so dormant - and for so long (relative to other viruses).  We have pretty effective drugs to kill those viruses that are not latent.  But there are always survivors.  In fact there are a number of therapies that do nothing but try to <i>force</i> the virus to become active, so that the other therapies can (reliably) kill it. And even then, there&#x27;s some that stay latent ready to stochastically turn on at some point.",1386457406

This was right during the dot-com bust; Akamai was losing customers left and right, and cash was very short.

As much as I favor memory optimizations, I think that merely trying to linearize the access patterns is completely futile in the case of graph databases. On that level of brute-force approach to speeding things up, you&#x27;ll most likely gain more performance by using lower-latency memory modules, or simply by using different data structures to accommodate for your specific cache line sizes and latencies, then by trying to linearize generic graphs.",1386457353

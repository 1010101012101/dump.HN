Users make mistakes - I just watched a customer this morning type name@domaincom instead of name@domain.com when entering his address. I've even seen users enter their names instead of email addresses when prompted for an email address. This happens all too often and can make database management a hassle. Checking the syntax first can make life a little easier for the DB guys.",1236653875

The reality is different in each region, even in each block.<p>After Soviet Union was collapsing, we've got this so-called free market (free from a regulation of the goverment). First, we got unlimited supply of the low-quality alcohol, after some failed attempts of the soviet goverment to combat drunkness.<p>The result? Almost 1/5 of population were died in 10 years with direct or indirect involvement of alcohol consumption. The cases of the mental degradation and illness were never counted. But the next generations afrer looking at their animal-like fathers and mothers, at least trying to avoid the booze.<p>The heroine problem is almost the same, but more brutal and fast-going. After you saw several tens of the lethal cases you will try to stop, and even with some success.<p>I think (as a person who actually did it) that the most effective solution is the natural one - when you saw the results, you, sooner or later, will try to figure out the cause.<p>And what people or goverment can do is to show the results to the youths, to educate them, because they just trying to imitate an adults - in our case - tired and hopeless creatures, who become happy (actually just relaxed) for very short periods of time with booze and sigarettes.<p>And be sure, there never was a problem to get any stuff among a low-income and uneducated.

509416,comment,509195,509195,0,0,patio11,,,"That gives some interesting possibilities for computers in a few years -- one relatively expensive drive for code, another cheap drive for data, for example.<p>Probably 80% of your hard drive is stuff where the access speed is irrelevant -- movies, for example, since your capability to read from the disk far outstrips your eyes' capability to watch the movie.  Photos, Office docs, email, ditto ditto ditto.<p>Then there are programs -- or even a subset of programs, really -- that actually have appreciable startup times.  Office, Eclipse, etc, I'm looking at you.<p>You could put those programs on the ""fast"" disk (along with most of the OS, presumably) then make it as big as you pleased with cheap spinning platters.  With a little bit of software trickery, you could present the two disks as one physical drive to the operating system (or to the end user) and shift data between them using some sort of caching policy (LRU, whatever).<p>It sounds like a sexy idea for servers too -- can't afford to keep the entire working set in RAM?  No problem -- back up the RAM with solid state and only write to spinning magnetic media when you need long-term non-volatile storage.",1236652589

But Microsoft's product decisions are largely driven by ""PMs"", whereas open source is driven by technical merit and Apple is driven by industrial design.  Microsoft occupies this weird middle ground, call it ""pragmatism"" (or even MBA-driven design :-).<p>This middle ground results in weak consumer products like Vista and Microsoft Mobile.  They aren't bad products, but lack the polish an industrial design-driven process could have produced.  They also lack the technical depth that open source is producing.  As a result Microsoft is getting squeezed from both ends.<p>Joel's products are similar: a good middle ground. Neither awe-inspiring (technical) or fun to use (design).",1236651120

509392,comment,509127,509272,0,0,joey,,,"Thank you very much for trying Voxli!<p>We require an install program because gamers require push-to-talk outside the browser. This cannot be accomplished with any amount of Javascript or Flash coding. The only way to break out of the browser sandbox is to write a piece of native code and install it as a browser plugin. This is why we have separate mac and windows plugins, for instance.<p>I agree that the MSI is pretty annoying. I don't really like to install random binaries either. At the end of the install, the browser should take you into your room without any user interaction -- which is why we don't show a ""install done"" dialog. But as it is confusing and not how most other apps do it, we'll look into making it more clear. The only other alternative for Windows was to use the Mozilla plugin installer as we do on Mac -- but that requires a browser restart and it was very confusing to users in our user tests. Overall I agree our install process has a lot of room for improvement and continued user feedback such as yours will help us refine it going forward.<p>You must hold down the push to talk button to talk. While you are holding it down, it says ""ON AIR"" and shows the waveform of your microphone recording. Agreed, we should probably add some help text to say that it is a push-hold button like a walkie-talkie and not a toggle button you click once.<p>If you want background noise, just click the 'always on' checkbox and the mic will stay on, giving you all the background noise you want. We don't default to this state because we are tailored for large groups. The background noise from 20 people would be pretty distracting, so we default to radio silence. Sometimes we think of it more as a walkie-talkie system for groups than a conference call.<p>The ""Add Rooms"" feature is definitely a work-in-progress. To clarify, people who aren't in the same ""room"" can't hear each other. This way, large gaming guilds can all be in the same channel and know who's online and what's going on, but still be broken up into smaller teams for communicating on specific tasks. One way we are working on improving this feature is to allow string names for rooms: for example, ""PVP Group 1"" or ""Room for Bored People"" instead of just a number. Also, you can only be in one room per browser tab. If you want to be in multiple rooms, open another tab to the same page.<p>Thanks again for the feedback! Seems I should start a FAQ on the website, or maybe add some help tips to the interface.",1236650591

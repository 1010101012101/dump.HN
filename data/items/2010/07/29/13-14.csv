Though, not sure if weekends are any different for most hackers, eh?<p>The thing is I want to spend my time this weekend building a web-app. But I don't want to work on something useless. I was wondering what do you guys think about having a hulu like service for programing screencasts, not just related on pure languages but also like learning Photoshop, WordPress blogs and what not. There are tons of these screencasts out there available freely but I think it would be nice to have it aggregated at one place with a clean UI. I know there are kinda related services out there, but most are paid and the free ones are just...Or maybe I haven't found the right one yet.<p>So, back to the question. Do you think it's worth it to spend my weekend on it? Would you use it? I think I should be able to build a functional prototype pretty easily in a weekend.<p>I would also love to hear if you have any ideas you want to give away for a weekend project :)<p>Thanks!",1280411938

What started as ""1/3rd of first years salary, paid on day 1 regardless of whether the employee works out or not"" can easily be negotiated into ""We'll pay you a flat rate of $10K after a 6 month probationary period where we determine if the employee is a good fit or not.""<p>Recruiters do have a large database of resumes, but more often than not I suppose people are using LinkedIn to find jobs, so recruiters are becoming irrelevant.  If you're having a hard time finding someone with the right experience though, a good recruiter can come in handy.  It's just hard to find a recruiter that actually knows the industry and isn't a trained monkey that rattles off acronyms.",1280411875

1557530,comment,1557209,1557405,0,0,araneae,,,"Sort of mostly right.  You can't artificially inseminate with an embryo though, only semen.<p>What was interesting about the experiment is that while they only selected for tameness, a lot of the characteristics you see in modern dogs arose.  For instance, piebald fur, curly fur, curly tails, floppy ears, shortened snout, etc.  Basically what was happening was that by selecting for tameness, they were both selecting for a lengthier juvenile period and more paedomorphic traits.<p>So this answered the question of how humans managed to select for traits in domesticated dogs that don't appear in wolves.  How do you select for piebald color if it isn't present in the initial gene pool?  Or a curly tail?  Well, those variations are a consequence of domestication.<p>For instance, only in domesticated animals do you see that characteristic white forehead star, and they made that discovery of what was happening from these animals.  As an animal grows, cells containing melanin migrate throughout the body.  But if you length the juvenile period and make them move more slowly, some die before they reach their final destination.  The white star on the forehead, seen in these foxes as well as horses, cows, and others, is because the melanin containing cells reach there last, and they don't quite make it.",1280411542

1557520,comment,1555083,1556171,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Well... You have to factor in the cost for the added HA infrastructure when you talk Windows. Patching Linux seldom requires more than a couple seconds for downtime for the system and I can often patch and bring up machines before memcaches and varnishes start expiring. Patching Windows often takes half-an-hour of downtime following another similarly extended period of horrible performance when the patch installer is doing whatever it needs to do, per server.<p>It's different to design a HA cluster that can sustain a minutes-long usage peak (due to a node going down for maintenance) than one that can sustain an hour-long outage of one of the nodes.<p>It all depends, in the end, on how the applications are designed to run - they are the ones that will decide how many servers you can take down at once. In any case, the shorter they are down, the better.<p>Consider a site with 3 front-facing web servers that are affected by a 0-day. If a server can be patched in 2 minutes, it will result in 6 minutes of 150% load on the servers not being maintained. If the patch takes an hour, you will have 3 hours of 150% workload. The internet user may not see the downtime, but you have to factor in the higher load. The best solution could be to use 4 or 5 servers instead of 3, but that would also increase your vulnerability window.",1280411387

Of COURSE there’s going to be a learning curve.'<p>As pointed out, Textmate is a new editor and you don't come to a standstill when you use it for the first time. But Vim is a fundamentally different KIND of editor than Textmate. It's not that it's a different program. It's that it's probably the first modal editor you've ever used. As far as I'm concerned, the whole bulk of the first and hardest step in learning Vim is just wrapping your head around editing modally. Whether you want to disable your arrow keys and obsessively leave Insert mode, in order to cultivate good habits, or you just want to muddle through and implement Vimisms where you can is wholly up to the reader. It's analogous to whether you want to cover your keycaps and use dvorak all the time even when you can't touch type, or just ease into it.

I'd be very wary of letting one of them (or one of the 'tame' ones above) near very young children though.<p>Dogs have been bred for many thousands of generations and yet there still are plenty of them that bear careful watching in spite of being tame, with these animals I'd be extra careful, their roots are much more wild than any regular dog you'll ever meet.<p>The brother of one of my ex employees in Canada had a half-wolf, half Sheppard. An absolutely amazing animal but imprinted on one person only, dog to him, wolf to the rest of the world. I imagine these foxes to be <i>much</i> more tame than their wild cousins but until you've seen them in stressful situations you'd have to be careful with individual specimen, even if as a breed they're considered tame enough for being around the house. The same goes for dogs.<p>In Australia there are people that hold dingos as pets, that's another interesting option.",1280408654

IIRC they were part of a science experiment to see if it was nature or nurture that was the key factor in the domestication of dogs.<p>Basically with each litter of foxes they selected the most friendly, and allowed them to breed, creating more friendly / domesticated foxes. They also selected the most vicious and bred them separately as a control. Later when the behaviours became more pronounced they artificially inseminated the vicious foxes with the domesticated foxes embryos to find out if they would be aggressive or domestic. They turned out to be domestic.<p>Interestingly because foxes are solitary animals they behave more like cats than dogs.",1280408639

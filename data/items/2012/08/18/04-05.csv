I just take a bunch of them each quarter and stash them in a notecard container (my less binding notebook, I guess), so I can carry a few blank cards on me on the go with a pen if I'm in a creative mood and when I get the chance I stash them in the back of the stack to keep things chronological.<p>So compared to my system, I love this and I think I'd love to try it out!

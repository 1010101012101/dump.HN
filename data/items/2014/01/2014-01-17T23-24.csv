I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s how they&#x27;re attached to the frame or an actual mechanical difference in the switches (or maybe it&#x27;s just all in my head?).<p>Laptop keyboards are pretty much universally terrible, but my MBP is probably the least. That said, my daily worker is a variable-weight Topre 103UB and it&#x27;s been pretty good despite missing an extra windows key to remap.<p>Take some sand paper to the sharp edges.

The sum is not infinite, but it’s neither a finite number, simply “not exist”.<p>The correct method is to calculate the partial sum of the first N term: S_N=sum_{n=1}_N (-1)^n. When N is even the amount of 1 and -1 are equal and the partial sum is 0. When N is odd then there is an additional 1 and the partial sum is 1. So the partial sum has no limit and then 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ... is not convergent.<p>Conditionally convergent series like 1-1/2+1/3-1/4+1/5-1/6+ ... =ln(2) are much better. (The problem is that 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+ ... = infinity.) You can operate with them almost freely, but you can’t rearrange the order of an infinite number of term.<p>The unconditionally convergent series like 1+1/4+1/9+1/16+...=pi^2/6 are almost like finite summations.

It&#x27;s still mostly considered a consumer brand, especially as they&#x27;ve focused on features like photo syncing with mobile phone partnerships. They&#x27;re an ideal fit for enterprises though and still have huge opportunities.<p>2. An app platform or what I call &quot;Bring Your Own Data&quot; (not unlike App.net and to some extent Evernote). This is a rising paradigm where users own their data and 3rd-party apps hook into it. Instead of the prevailing cloud model where apps and data are silo&#x27;d. An early example is Tunebox, which plays and manipulates MP3s within your own Dropbox instead of hosting them on your behalf. Another example is the way 1Password uses Dropbox to sync data instead of doing its own hosting and syncing.<p>The app platform is really big as developers don&#x27;t have to think about syncing. Traditionally data sync has been one of the main benefits of the web. But Dropbox API means developers can write rich, native, apps on any platform and assume the syncing &quot;just works&quot;.<p>This is a bit like the other fork in the road that Twitter walked away from, ie to be the underlying cloud infrastructure for apps. (I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if Dropbox acquired App.Net or similar to provide a powerful pubsub layer too.) Developers focus on making awesome user-interfaces and delegate all the network infrastructure to Dropbox.

(e.g. $str->pos())<p>- Speaking of which, since the strings don&#x27;t have methods, they stick out like a sore thumb in OO code. String and array handling code invariably ends up ugly unless you write everything procedural style (and then you have other issues).<p>- Sort() cannot be made to sort unicode on windows, regardless of which parameters you give it. In fact, the only way to sort unicode on windows is by using the Collator from the intl extension. Part of that is microsoft&#x27;s fault by not supporting UTF-8 in the windows API&#x27;s at all, but PHP isn&#x27;t helping.<p>- If you don&#x27;t care about windows, the proper way to sort text is first calling setlocale(LC_COLLATE, &quot;en_US.UTF8&quot;) and then passing the SORT_LOCALE_STRING argument as second parameter to every call to sort(). Ugly, ugly, ugly.<p>- natsort(), aka &quot;natural sort&quot; cannot be used to sort text like a human would expect, in any context. It always produces invalid results, even for ANSI codepages. (e.g. try to sort resume, rope and résumé)<p>- The use of utf8_decode and utf8_encode is actively harmful in almost all circumstancces. There is never a good reason to use them, since the very rare case where you need them iconv or mb_convert_encoding are better suited. Yet, the PHP documentation doesn&#x27;t tell you this, causing lots of people to be led astray (as I once was).<p>- Oh yeah, and there are no less than three API&#x27;s for unicode string handling, the mb_ functions, the iconv_ functions and the grapheme_ functions. What&#x27;s the difference? I don&#x27;t know, and I really can&#x27;t be bothered to read PHP&#x27;s source to find out.<p>- htmlentities() always requires the parameters ENT_QUOTES, &quot;UTF-8&quot; to do its job securely (well, almost, as it doesn&#x27;t encode forward slash which OWASP recommends). Unless you use a wrapper, your code is yet again uglified.<p>- The secure way to JSON-encode text is, and I kid you not, json_encode($data, JSON_HEX_TAG|JSON_HEX_APOS|JSON_HEX_QUOT|JSON_HEX_AMP). Try typing that three times in a row, I dare you.<p>- And finally, mysql is by far the worst database for unicode handling, because it cannot sort unicode text according to the standard, at all, no matter what you do. That&#x27;s not PHP&#x27;s fault ofcourse, but since I&#x27;m bitching... :)",1390001178

It&#x27;s my primary desktop OS because of being both a rolling release distro and being a rolling release distro that distributes packages in binary form. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Gentoo, but I find my patience waiting for large builds (KDE, X, Firefox, etc) diminishing over time. The AUR also has such a vast number of packages, I can&#x27;t really think of more than one or two circumstances where something I needed wasn&#x27;t available (or I was too stupid to know what to search for which was probably the case).<p>ABS is a godsend for exactly those reasons you cite since you don&#x27;t have to worry about installing tons of rubbish into the file system for cleanup later (if there is a later). Though, I&#x27;ve found using the ABS SVN repos handy once or twice in the event I needed an older version (and wiped my cache, not realizing ARM was available at that time).<p>All things considered, Arch is the best of both worlds in terms of a strong, binary package manager and the ability to tweak packages through custom builds. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it&#x27;s a panacea but it comes darn close. I&#x27;ll risk coming off as an evangelist, but I can&#x27;t help myself: When I discovered Arch, it made Linux a tremendous joy to use and helped me rediscover the passion I felt when I first discovered Gentoo many years ago. The difference is that this passion has been sustainable. :)",1390000454

Second, you assume that people who challenge Libertarians want central control and are opposed to the free market. Why does everyone have to think so black and white?<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, if Libertarians actually stayed true to the underlying principle of Libertarianism (the sovereignty of the individual over his own person, body and labor), and also stayed honest about what it means to have a free market (which follows from individual sovereignty over their person and labor), then I would become an ardent supporter. Unfortunately, as this article points out, most libertarians completely betray these principles when they argue for 100% sovereign rights over land and any other of the finite resources of this planet. If you understand the free-market, and you looked at it honestly, then you would realize that land ownership (defined as ownership in perpetuity) is completely antithetical to the free market, because you can essentially buy an infinite amount of something (perpetual ownership) for a finite cost.<p>In my opinion, a true Libertarian would realize that some things are part of The Commons, and by necessity we need to figure out a communal way for managing The Commons. If we want the free market to manage the commons, then we have to first treat it like the commons (e.g. we are all owners, and are all owed a share of the ground rent).",1390000406

Programmers often remap caps lock (I personally use this tool [1]), and it&#x27;s nice to have a big target for the pinky. Remapping is of course possible with these new keyboards, but the split key design that replaces caps lock leaves a much smaller target. In addition, I&#x27;m sure there are hunt and peck typists that still legitimately use caps locks instead of shift because it requires less coordination and hand contortions, so leaving caps lock alone also has accessibility benefits.<p>One area where keyboard designers aren&#x27;t innovating enough is the spacebar. The left 2/3 of the space bar is rarely used by most touch typists and hogs very accessible real estate. I like how Microsoft split the spacebar on their new keyboard [2] and replaced the left half with backspace, the most commonly typed (but normally most hard to reach) key.<p>I&#x27;m disappointed to see thinkpad/lenovo make these mistakes given their reputation for quality laptop keyboards.

I can&#x27;t really understand why anyone would even _think_ that would be the case?<p>In fact, I just don&#x27;t understand the problem people have with the &#x27;parallel construction&#x27; of evidence. By its very nature, if the original evidence existed, and new alternative sources can be found, these it must be believed that they point to the fact a crime has been committed. In which case it should be prosecuted, and the criminals brought to justice. Or are people suggesting that if the NSA finds evidence of a crime, that crime can no longer be prosecuted even using alternative, non-NSA sourced evidence? That we should just wait until investigators stumble across the crime by accident, and allow many criminals to avoid prosecution?<p>My feeling is that if a valid and uncontested, un-tainted evidence trail exists, showing that a crime has been committed, then morally there is no problem. We are not talking about the use of torture to obtain the original evidence, for example, rather it is a side effect of the intelligence gathering process. This sort of cross-pollination between intelligence agencies and law enforcement has always been present, and the source of the original &#x27;tip off&#x27; was generally inadmissible due to classification or to protect sources.<p>This is not even a new idea. Law enforcement has to deal with &#x27;tainted&#x27; and inadmissible evidence all the time, from protected sources, conversations overheard in bars and so on... Sometimes the evidence has even been allowable at the time it was collected, but circumstances change later. Anyway, in these situations it is standard practice to try and obtain different, non-tainted and admissible evidence pointing to the same outcome.<p>We now have a new word for this, in &#x27;parallel construction&#x27; but the outcome is no different.",1390000244

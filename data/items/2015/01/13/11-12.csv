I had hopes that Steam Machines may leverage Linux to consumers but trying to configure my father&#x27;s Linux machine to his needs brought me back to reality.<p>I even think that the consumer perspective is the one that hinders Linux. Want to develop something for Linux? What&#x27;s the display server? Proprietary or free drivers? What Desktop Environment? QT or GTK Application? All those things are fine to develop for, but what do you develop for when you don&#x27;t have time to test and support every existing configuration.",1421150325

That&#x27;s meant that as the SoC has been getting smaller and more efficient, the battery has also been getting smaller due to the reduced phone size.<p>Now in the case of the iPhone 6 it can&#x27;t get any smaller as its only slightly thicker than the headphone jack. Removing the headphone jack only gets you an extra few millimeters before you hit the Lightning port. So without a major redesign it&#x27;s as thin as it can get for the moment.<p>So from this point onwards I would expect so see battery life increase as extra space in the case grabbed from size reductions from the SoC goes to battery. The 6 plus seems to follow this design pattern.<p>(Assuming there isn&#x27;t a major advance in battery technology)",1421149617

I have no more dandruff, no rash or other headskin condition.<p>The body took it very well. Using only water and a turkish rubbing cloth. I didn&#x27;t smell. I even asked a few colleagues ( female too ) to tell me if they noticed something about me, and there was nothing out of the ordinary. My armpits were sweating but no unpleasant smell would be produced. Some women found me even more attractive ;), but this might be subjective.<p>Reason for the lack of smell is most probably the natural bacteria that eat all of my body output ( sweat, dead skin, etc ). The cold shower was keeping this bacteria alive, since hot water has some effect ( dilutuing fat and killing some of them ).<p>In the end, was a positive experiment.

Pieces of broken glass are very suitable for GPU raytracing, because rendering them is not a &quot;branchy&quot; task since there is no scattering, only definite reflection/refraction. The reflections also make it look like there were a lot more triangles. With Monte Carlo sampling you need 4x samples for .5x error, which means that a lot of samples are needed for scattered indirect illumination in a typical scene (I think in the order of 100 to 1000). In VCT you only need 7-13 samples but a lot of preprocessing.",1421148832

I can spot those days in advance, they&#x27;re not surprises.<p>So I found a remarkably simple and obvious solution: I spent £50 and bought an external battery pack, something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/RAVPower-15000mAh-External-Generation-Portable-Black/dp/B00OJXVDAU/ref=sr_1_14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/RAVPower-15000mAh-External-Generatio...</a> . It charges overnight, weighs not all that much at the bottom of a shoulder bag, but on those crucial days when battery is getting slim, I can just pull a cable out, plug it into my phone, and bingo: the phone is charged.<p>It&#x27;s capable of charging an iPhone several times over so <i>easily</i> solves the problem for you and even some of your friends.",1421146864
8879048,comment,8875445,8878304,0,0,lmm,,,"> def toVector: Vector[B] = fold(Vector[B]())(_ :+ _)(_ ++ _)<p>> To a Scala veteran, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s easy to understand; to someone who&#x27;s been learning the language (like me) it looks like gibberish.<p>Compare what the same code would look like in Ruby; something like (hope I get the syntax right):<p><pre><code>    def toVector = fold(new Vector()) {|x, y| x :+ y} {|x, y| x ++ y}\n</code></pre>\nAre the extra |x, y|s actually clarifying anything? Or are they just syntactic ceremony? Maybe it&#x27;s just my scala experience talking, but I think the scala example is clearer; there&#x27;s very little performance to get in the way, just the meat of what the function&#x27;s actually doing<p>(You can think that&#x27;s a good or bad function to have, but that&#x27;s a library question, not a language question).<p>> simply because of the underlying api that other co-workers have built.<p>You can write bad APIs in any language; with a more sensible one that would look like:<p><pre><code>    client.post(args).map{\n      case Success(response) => response\n      case ServerError(ex) => throw ex\n      case UnhandledError(ex) => throw ex\n    }\n</code></pre>\nExplicitly handling the different cases is exactly the kind of debugging advantage I was talking about; it takes up-front effort to distinguish between ServerError and UnhandledError, but the result is code where you can see all the possibilities and know exactly where any given failure might be happening. (And again, the language doesn&#x27;t force you to do this; you <i>can</i> just write the happy path and allow any kind of exception to happen at any point. But you&#x27;ll pay the price in debugging, as I have in Python, and as I presume you have in Ruby).",1421146822

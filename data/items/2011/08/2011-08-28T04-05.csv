Calling 911 from a cell phone connects you to a big regional call center that gets your location and transfers you to your local one, whereas calling 911 from a land line connects you to your local emergency call center immediately.<p>Also, calling 911 from a land line gives the dispatcher your address.

But few people have legitimately good ideas that are connected to the ability of the organization to execute, the general competitive landscape, and the needs of the marketplace.</i><p>Thank you for pointing this out.<p>For startups, the truth is that it takes a <i>lot</i> more than vision to succeed. You need the ability to sell people (investors and employers) on something that doesn't exist yet, a certain tactical acumen, nerves of steel, and quite a bit of luck. You also need a deep technical knowledge because you can't evaluate your first technical hires unless you're technical yourself. This is a tough bill to fit, and vision alone is not enough.<p>Large-company vision is different, and the problem there is that the people who have the necessary skills essentially cannot rise to the top. They tend to be way too passionate to pay their dues, shut up when bad decisions are made, and plod along accruing influence at a pathetic, glacial pace rather than attempting to seize power (which doesn't work in a corporate context; you just get fired). Would Steve Jobs get to the top of any large corporation today? Fuck no, not a chance.<p>Generally, people who rise to the top of large companies are mediocre in terms of visionary ability but extremely <i>reliable</i>. They're not all political sociopaths or assholes; most are perfectly nice people. What they are is very good at performing well no matter what is going on, what kind of work they get, and how they feel about what is going on-- people whose performance has an abnormally low sensitivity to morale and who can therefore sustain middling to high performance, without faltering, over decades. People who have vision almost never meet that description, because vision comes with passion which is another word for getting pissed off when the wrong thing happens.",1314507216

It's also common to restrict defamation and false advertizing (expressing ideas which are not true in order to harm another, either in reputation or in an economic transaction).

2933265,comment,2931234,2932182,3,0,kijiki,,,"This was true of pretty much every CPU generation before the P4.  Deeper pipelines result in lower FO4 (and thus higher attainable clock frequency), but a higher penalty for branch misprediction, among other things.<p>Historically (pre-P4) this was a great tradeoff.  The Alpha 21064 was a barn-stormer; it ran at nearly twice the Mhz of its brainiac competitors at the time.  This more than made up for a deeper pipeline and simpler execution units.<p>What killed the P4 was that they hit the power wall.  Moore's law scaling of gate size no longer resulted in a corresponding scaling of power usage.<p>It is hard to blame the P4 designers too much for this, since people have been prophesying the end of Moore's law since the mid-80s at least.  They happened to be designing when it actually happened on power.  Current designers should look to that lesson when relying on increasing density...<p>Of course, these lessons are pretty useless, because much like a stock market bubble, Moore's law continues on a given metric until it doesn't.  And it is always obvious in retrospect.",1314504869

2933248,comment,2931234,2932579,8,0,kijiki,,,"The P-III has 8 general purpose registers, just like all pre-64bit x86 CPUs, all the way back to the 8086.  x86-64 (aka amd64) CPUs have 16.<p>But it gets a bit more complicated.  I'm talking about (and your references to compilers suggests that you are as well) architectural registers; the things assembly programmers and compiler writers see.<p>The actual register file in the CPU has many more registers on out-of-order CPUs like the Pentium Pro and later; these are physical registers, and are mapped to the architectural registers dynamically by the register renamer.  This is done to prevent false dependencies from preventing parallel execution of instructions in the same instruction stream.<p>The work done by the compiler to map live variables into architectural registers is mostly orthogonal to the work the CPU's instruction scheduler does to map architectural registers to physical ones.  In some sense, more architectural registers are better, but there are diminishing returns, and eventually other considerations make more worse.  x86-64's 16 architectural registers is a pretty good compromise for current generation CPUs.<p>Your comparison between ARM CPUs and x86 is somewhat spurious, since the instruction set defines the architectural registers: 16 for x86-64, 32 for ARM.  A given out-of-order implementation can choose whatever number of physical registers gives optimal performance, and given the stakes and available engineering resources, both ARM and Intel/AMD will choose optimal (or exceptionally close to optimal) numbers for this.<p>Long story short, the number of architectural registers is an extremely small part of why ARM is or isn't ""pWning"" Intel on low power platforms.",1314504122

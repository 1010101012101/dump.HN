At least, once you understand it, it has less gotchas than bash scripting.<p>It&#x27;s the rest of the utilities that they&#x27;re trying to couple to it that are bullshit. Starting with the journal - asking for the last few lines of the journal can take half a minute for some reason.

And then the exam was worthless as an indicator of how good you are. Even my friend who tried to copy and paste off Yahoo Answers got a 5 (the highest you can get). You can look at the course description[0]—it&#x27;s easier than Programming 101 (of course not even close to the MIT version). It&#x27;s all in java and you don&#x27;t have to know what a pointer is.<p>> <i>The languages are getting easier and more powerful.</i><p>Definitely agree with you on that one. I am learning swift right now and it has come really far from objective-C.<p>> <i>I think the world will soon just have 2 groups of people - people who program or make things, and people who don&#x27;t.</i><p>Now that is an interesting perspective.<p>> <i>If I am to choose an easily, portable skill to harness, programming is better than box-packing or coffee-pouring.</i><p>That&#x27;s a really unfair comparison. Those are jobs you get for minimum wage. You can&#x27;t major in box-packing in college, but you can major in software engineering.<p>As I said before, maybe you&#x27;re right. My fear is that really, my skills are not unique or specialized. They are just “Oh, I know some C, and some Objective-C, and some Python, and some JavaScript, and some Java, and some shell scripting, and barely any C++”. I feel like nothing stands out from that. With the exception of Objective-C (I&#x27;m including the native frameworks here), those are all languages that every programmer should know (C) or would be able to pick up fairly quickly (Java).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-computer-science-course-description.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-c...</a>",1409398629

8246175,comment,8239251,8239251,1,0,duffx,,,"Keep in mind that after 2-3 weeks of habitual coffee drinking, your body acclimates to the effects of caffeine and you no longer receive a performance benefit. At that point all drinking coffee does for you is ward off the effects of withdrawal and return you to baseline performance levels - until the effects wear off and withdrawal kicks in again, at which point your performance is below average.<p>Caffeine is best used strategically, which means not every day. Save it for days where you&#x27;re feeling particularly low energy, or need a boost to tackle a problem you&#x27;re not particularly excited about doing.<p>That said, the half-life of caffeine is around 6 hours, which means if you have a coffee at 3pm, at 3am you still have a quarter-cup&#x27;s worth of caffeine in your system, preventing you from entering deep sleep. So even then I&#x27;d keep caffeine as a first-thing-in-the-morning type of deal.<p>Naps I&#x27;m a big fan of. I take one every day after lunch. The trick is to simply lay down and close your eyes for 20 minutes. Don&#x27;t worry if you fall asleep or not - just give your eyes a rest. For the first few days/weeks, you might not fall asleep. But eventually your body grows accustomed to the ritual and it becomes easier to actually fall asleep at hat time.",1409398582

8246139,comment,8246030,8246030,6,0,dctoedt,,,"Most lawyers get to see this movie from time to time with their own clients; the bar has developed some folk wisdom that gets preached at continuing-education conferences and in bar-association publications.  <i>(Usual disclaimer: Don&#x27;t rely on the following as a substitute for legal advice, YMMV, etc.)</i><p>1. If you signed the client&#x27;s contract form, that likely is what governs; it&#x27;s unsurprising that they don&#x27;t want to sign yours, because that could lead to confusion if the terms are inconsistent.<p>2. [EDITED] It&#x27;s super-important to put task expectations in writing, UP FRONT, even if just in a quick email, in part because:<p>(a) Putting expectations in writing will help you keep the client happy about your results. Whether or not the client <i>should</i> be happy is of less importance than that the client pretty much always gets to decide:<p>(i) whether to hire you again, and<p>(ii) whether to recommend you to others.<p>(b) If a dispute arises later, it&#x27;s easier to dissuade the client from behaving badly if you can show them a writing to which (you can argue) they previously agreed, even if only implicitly.<p>(c) In the (unlikely) event you end up in litigation, courts tend to give more credence -- other things being equal -- to contemporaneous written documentation than to after-the-fact witness testimony. Courts realize that memory is fallible in the best of circumstances, and also that witnesses can have axes to grind, scores to settle, agendas to advance, etc.<p>3. It&#x27;s not unreasonable for a client to want to cap what they pay for Task X.  It&#x27;s a different question if they want to do that after you&#x27;ve already finished Task X on an agreed per-hour basis.<p>4. To get a better &quot;estimate of the situation,&quot; you might want to consider whether you&#x27;re really an independent contractor, or whether instead you&#x27;re an employee and thus entitled to certain legal protections (which can vary depending on where you are). [1]<p>5. [ADDED:]  I agree with the commenters who suggest having a tactful conversation with the client in a collaborative tone.<p>6. If you still have problems going forward, you need to think seriously about whether to continue working for this client. Some clients just aren&#x27;t worth it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employ...</a>",1409396716
8246137,comment,8246030,8246030,3,0,IgorPartola,,,"I do not generally insist that people sign my contracts. This is a bad sign. The logic of &quot;each task should take no more than 2 hours is flawed&quot;. You can easily combat this by breaking up tasks further into subcategories. In fact, that is generally a good idea for tasks over 8-16 hours when creating estimates. So there are things you can do on your end.<p>Having said that, I would give them a call and explain politely that you are a professional and your work is worth what you are billing them. If they are not going to pay you, then you will simply stop working for them (assuming you can afford to do so). You can even say &quot;if you cannot afford to have me work X hours, that is one thing. Let&#x27;s talk about that. But otherwise initially you agreed to pay X for Y. I delivered the work, and you are not paying. Why should I continue working with you?&quot;",1409396649

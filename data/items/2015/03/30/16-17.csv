9290800,comment,9267224,9285067,0,0,crpatino,,,"You keep talking about bugs and therefore you keep missing the point. As a matter of fact, I tend to agree with you that the Infosec community would benefit enormously by adopting some of the best practices that we lowly programmers take for granted. There would arguably be less bug and less high-profile bugs that way.<p>What I am trying to point out is that you cannot fix a flawed Security Design by incremental improvements. I am not talking about individual coding defects or even desirable features that have been left temporarily unimplemented on purpose. I am talking about Stupid!Ideas that get implemented because there was nobody around that recognized them as such, and then the usual traits of human nature (denial, previous investment bias, rationalization, etc) prevents the incumbents from scrapping those ideas until insurmountable evidence is assembled.<p>The article in question talks about using One Time Pads (OTPs) to conceal secrets. This is an idea that sounds good, OTP is mathematically proven to be &quot;unbreakable&quot; and all that... The problem is when theory meets practice and nobody asks the hard question: How are sender and receiver going to share the OTP prior to sending the real message.<p>This is not a trivial question to ask, giving the fact that OTP must have the same amount of bits as the message it is protecting. You can also not &quot;recycle&quot; a single OTP for many messages (that would be a Many Time Pad, which by definition violates the very preconditions that make OTP secure).<p>So, you end up with the scheme used in spy movies (I have no idea how real spies worked during the Cold War). Each spy carries around a code-book of OTPs that he received in hand by a trusted contact. The fact of being in possession of such book is itself a proof of being a spy so he was to take great care to hide it, which is hard because it is a whole book (OTP, lots a lots of messages). Also, the spy agency will have the cumbersome work of providing a different code-book to each spy (because otherwise, when the enemy catches one spy, they could theoretically run the OTP on all previous communications from suspected spies and have each one of them rounded and shot before the word comes out that the first spy was in prison).<p>This example also serves to illustrate another point. Maybe a Bad!Idea can be made to work in a limited way, if need is dire and resources are plenty. But any organization which kept secrets of real importance and tried to rely on this kind of solution would end up eaten alive by any adversary that had heard the words &quot;asymmetric cryptography&quot; spoken together.",1427734461

Do you need to have this type of unassailable position if you&#x27;re going to root out very powerful corrupt peers/figures? Or do you root our very powerful peers so you can have an unassailable position?<p>I wonder about the premise: I think the widely accepted theory is that &#x27;assailability&#x27; and corruption have an inverse relationship; that is, the less assailable you are the more likely you are to be corrupt. I think the real chicken and egg question is, &#x27;do you need an unssailable position to root out your political opposition, or do you need to root out your political opposition to become unassailable&#x27;.<p>Democratic leaders are far more assailable -- they have limited power, they can be removed from office, and they are open to public attacks by the media, the public, and competing politicans -- but are considered, partly for that reason, to be less corrupt.",1427734300

When I teach engine out emergencies in multiengine aircraft one of the challenges is to quickly identify which engine is failing. The most obvious effect of an loss of thrust on one engine is yaw (rotation of the airplane about the vertical axis), pilot&#x27;s natural reaction is to compensate for the yaw by pushing on the opposite foot pedal (because pedals control the yaw). So one leg is pushing hard on the pedal, the other one is not. Now it&#x27;s easy to identify the failed engine &quot;DEAD FOOT = DEAD ENGINE&quot; where dead foot is the relaxed one. If the left foot is relaxed then the left engine has lost thrust.<p>The next thing is establishing so called zero sideslip, which means banking few degrees into the good engine.

For instance, the purpose of a high school class many might take to be to learn how to take derivatives and integrals and apply them to a few common types of problems. After all, that&#x27;s what you spend your time building up to, and what final exams on the class cover, so that&#x27;s the point, right? But to the contrary, the skills and problem solving you get from doing those things in more rigor, with the details fully fleshed out instead of glossed over, and with motivation properly explained, is the real purpose.<p>In short, what I think this book will do is teach to the test, where the test is a template final exam from the type of course it purports to cover. But as we are all well aware, exams are not always proxies for whether you learned the whole of the material. Based on the depth of information provided, I&#x27;d say if your goal was to pass that class for your GED and never touch the information again and never try to apply it outside of the small template given by the textbooks, maybe it&#x27;s useful. If you want practical knowledge that you can apply in a variety of situations and use to continue your education past this point, you&#x27;re going to be missing a lot of very important details.",1427733728

But it doesn&#x27;t really seem to look that way.  While I suspect that there&#x27;s some truth to the adage, it&#x27;s definitely not absolute.<p>> Science that says &quot;This 1000ths gallon of water is gonna be as good as worthless&quot; seems to favor the point rather than oppose it.<p>That&#x27;s not the point.  The point is that as you have more of a thing, it takes more to move the needle.  EVERYTHING has decreasing marginal utility, and money does too.  But I don&#x27;t think the marginal utility of money ever becomes zero, or goes negative.  Do you think that?  If so, please start sending me your money so that you can be happier!<p>Here&#x27;s a great example for you.  Raises are nearly always percentages right?  Why not just give everyone a $100 a year raise?  I mean, that $100 is supposed to be the same to everyone, isn&#x27;t it?  10% more money increases your happiness approximately the same, no matter what number that 10% increase is applied to.<p>> As for your graphs, what I was saying is precisely that, unless you&#x27;ve been trained to read graphs (and most people are not), you&#x27;re going to be &quot;fooled&quot; more easily by the second one, won&#x27;t you ?<p>I think that if you want to understand the way a system works across many orders of magnitude the only way to do so without fooling yourself is to look at a log/log plot.

As usual, the less you pay, the more you get, and now apparently that includes the wholesale American Dream of home ownership.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand from a legal perspective, is how statue of limitation can possibly apply. The time limit would have to be filing of the case, not conclusion right? I know there were issues with robo-signing and all that, but did the loan servicers really drop the ball so badly?  (Edit: The answer is in the actual case PDF I found and linked to below -- the original foreclosure was dimissed without prejudice because the bank couldn&#x27;t produce the necessary documents, namely an original copy of the mortgage.)<p>Mortgage servicing is outsourced by the government in fairly lucrative contracts. The bank you get the loan from is almost never (credit unions are the obvious exception) the company that collects your payments each month.

Introduction:<p><pre><code>  “No one gets a free house.” This Court and others have uttered\n  that admonition since the early days of the mortgage crisis, where\n  homeowners have sought relief under a myriad of state and federal\n  consumer protection statutes and the Bankruptcy Code. Yet, with a\n  proper measure of disquiet and chagrin, the Court now must retreat\n  from this position, as Gordon A. Washington (“the  Debtor”)  has\n  presented  a  convincing  argument  for  entitlement  to  such\n  relief.  So,  with figurative hand holding the nose, the Court,\n  for the reasons set forth below, will grant Debtor’s motion for\n  summary judgment.\n\n</code></pre>\nEdit 2: The lawyers for the bank seem like complete neanderthals?! The statue of limitations is 6 years from the date of maturity, which was accelerated, so debtor claims it&#x27;s been 6 years since the accelerated date. But the statue specifically says the bank can <i>extend</i> the date of maturity by written instrument. So... write a note de-accelerating the acceleration by 1 year, and re-file the foreclosure.<p>It&#x27;s also not even clear the statue in question was effective in this case. The judge assumes that based on a prior statue which did say it was to be effective for all foreclosures filed after that date, but the law in question says no such thing.<p>And a final closing remark, as I just got to the last sentence in the PDF:<p><pre><code>  &quot;The Court will proceed to gargle in an effort to remove the \n  lingering bad taste.&quot;</code></pre>",1427732717

9290508,comment,9288329,9288329,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"He&#x27;s more right than most people are on the Dunning-Kruger effect. What it actually tells us is that self-assessed competence estimates carry low signal: the correlation is almost zero. This might be a regular, pointwise regression to the mean, or it might be an artifact of the aggregation (i.e. it could be that some people are great self-estimators but others are way off the mark).<p>What Dunning-Kruger tells us is that, with regard to certain abilities and especially social skills, people are bad guessers of their own competence and that most people think of themselves as slightly above average.<p>I think that he&#x27;s also somewhat right on money vs. happiness. Self-reported happiness is not the same thing as actual happiness. You might rate yourself a &quot;7&quot; at two times of life, but be behaviorally different. Your &quot;7&quot; when you are poor might be, &quot;commute sucked, but no one yelled at me at work today&quot;; but when you&#x27;re rich, it might mean &quot;hotel is nice, but staff forgot to fold the toilet paper into a triangle&quot;. Self-reported contentment is the same, but stress levels and behavioral measures of happiness are very different. It is true that after $75k per person, other factors have more of an effect on happiness than money itself. You have to account for cost of living and family size, of course.<p>Then there are job quality issues. A writer who reliably makes $100k per year is a smashing success; a professor earning that, at 40, is more than respectable; but someone who&#x27;s a &quot;Software Engineer II&quot;, making that, at age 40 is a failure. I think that success is much more strongly correlated to happiness than income. People with Harvard MBAs making $250k per year are often the most miserable people on earth, while famous artists who make a fraction of that often love their lives.<p>His relating this to type systems is a bit silly. You can&#x27;t put all &quot;static typing&quot; languages in the same bucket. Java&#x27;s static typing is a hindrance with little power. Haskell&#x27;s static typing is extremely effective-- if you know how to use it. Also, quality of the engineers matters more than the language itself: I&#x27;d much rather work on a disciplined Clojure or Ruby team than a sloppy Scala team that&#x27;s still using Java patterns. If it is properly used, a Haskell-like type system can make code quality very high indeed. That said, most businesses aren&#x27;t willing to budget the time for quality code, and that&#x27;s a language-independent problem.",1427732174

Google is now paying about $4B a year to people to host (or white label) a search box that goes back to Google. Then if you want to offer advertising on your search you generally have to get it from Google too, but that isn&#x27;t as valuable as it once was and that is a problem for Google.<p>But perhaps the most interesting thing I&#x27;ve learned from my 5 years at Blekko doing search is that &quot;phase 2 or 3&quot; of the Internet is here. Crawling everything is a waste of resources because 95% of the &quot;new&quot; stuff coming online on the Internet is not information, it is just spam. This combined with advertiser burnout from getting scammed again and again on advertising that claims to generate leads or sales but leads only to click farms. And the whole eco system of the web is in being rocked, along with media distribution. The world is approaching some sort of climactic shift of orientation.<p>Blekko&#x27;s key mission has always been to try to find the needles in this exponentially growing pile of hay. And it is something that the folks at Watson really liked about our technology when we first met at their outreach program to connect with startups. That is what lead to their asking us to join them, and no, they weren&#x27;t particularly interested in the stuff we had done to provide more topical advertising signals. So as a technologist this has been both a validation of our work on finding the real information in the web and making it useful to people, and, when I&#x27;m honest with myself, a welcome step away from working on still more advertising technology.<p>Having the resources to pursue that, and an engine (Watson) that can put it to use, seems pretty exciting.",1427731704

9290412,comment,9289500,9289500,0,0,at-fates-hands,,,"Here&#x27;s some solid advice which I used to make the transfer myself.<p>First of all, pick a niche industry and own it. Too many agencies I see are just out to make money by developing as many apps and sites as possible. This means a lot of cold calling into different industries and talking to a lot of different people with different needs. If you stick with one industry, pretty soon, you&#x27;ll find areas where you can really start to focus. This in turn makes you valuable to not only business, but then your name starts to get passed around since you have specific ways you&#x27;re helping other people in that industry. Less cold calling and more referrals is what follows then. I would also start locally, get as many customers in your local niche then broaden out, go regional, then national.<p>Secondly, the one thing that has made my agency successful is minimizing overhead. It&#x27;s basically me and my partner. We work from our homes, but are in constant contact with each other (technology is great ain&#x27;t it?). This means, no employees to pay, no office rent, no heating bills, no additional hardware or furniture. It allows us to keep our rates fairly low and still have a very nice profit margin since we have so little upfront costs. This also benefits our clients since it saves them money too.<p>Lastly, I use a progressive billing system. I start out working with my clients on an hourly rate - mainly doing consultation work. Then once we start having steady work, I go to them and say, &quot;Hey, you&#x27;re paying a lot for my hourly rate since and we&#x27;re always doing work for you, why don&#x27;t we just set up a monthly total (a 5-8% discount off my hourly rate) with a minimum of hours I need to work for your company each month and go from there?&quot; 90% of our clients have switched over to a monthly or yearly billing subscription. This is a biggie since you don&#x27;t have to worry so much about where your next project is coming from, you can really focus on your clients and know you have a steady stream of revenue coming in. This also allows you to continue to cold call and bring in new business - makes a huge difference compared to working project to project.<p>Hope this helps!",1427731447

There was obviously no design or usability testing involved anywhere in the process. It practically requires familiarity with the CLI client before you can figure out how to do anything at all.<p>It frequently shows active buttons and menu items that don&#x27;t actually do anything when pushed. So they can&#x27;t do one of the most basic GUI operations correctly-- dim stuff that&#x27;s not relevant.<p>Simple mistakes like the process for undoing the latest commit being to click the commit <i>before</i> it, then selecting &quot;rewind to here&quot; (or something; this is from memory.) Because God forbid you just let the user click the latest commit and choose &quot;undo&quot;, they might discover that without having to Google it!<p>But what really prevents me from using it is how goddamned slow it is.

That&#x27;s human nature. But also, maybe you already understand some parts and want to skip ahead to the more difficult parts. Sadly, in the excessively constrained format of video, sometimes the teacher will choose to focus on the topics you already understand, and neglects others. Such are the limitations of video format -- and indeed, of brick and mortar classes! Only the full, unabridged text gives you a (relatively) unconstrained explanation of all relevant topics. Of course, it also comes with some disadvantages: it can overwhelm the student, or present topics in the wrong order, or -- even -- focus on the &quot;wrong&quot; things, because after all written notes are also space-constrained. But I find it a way less constrained format anyway.<p>I find taking notes to be an uninteresting artifact of &quot;live&quot; classes. What truly matters is that you do the exercises and understand them.<p>If I gave the impression that I favored the &quot;lazy&quot; approach, I apologize. To be honest, I think watching the videos is both the lazy approach (only reading the notes seems like the serious approach to me) AND a time-waster. You are both more efficient AND gain a better understanding of the source material if you read the written notes/book and also do the exercises.",1427731389

If it helps, think of the clients as users of an app, who go through an onboarding process. How do they discover the app? What do they associate with the brand? What steps do they go through and what is the conversion rate on the &quot;funnel&quot;?<p>You simply build your brand, including a website, a blog and attract people to it. Get known widely (by having content that people share) and deeply (through good work and referrals). This takes time to build. But it&#x27;s like any other brand.<p>Basically, you need a brand, and cultivate relationships. Probably the best two pieces of advice I can give you are:<p>1) Make it safe to fail, so you can iterate and try better things. For example, have 100 users and only try a particular pricing or offer with 5 of them. A/B test various website designs, email marketing strategies, etc. Partner with one or more business developers who are passionate about client relations, and give them % of PROJECTS, not the company. This way, if anything fails, it doesn&#x27;t bring down the whole thing. And you can do this &quot;all day&quot; because your expected value is always nonzero, so the more you do it, the more you get. You can even hire others to do your job for you - again, on commission. Like 2 levels of MLM.<p>2) Establish relationships before you need them. Network, and let people know what you need without pushing them. Over time when you really need something, you do 90% of the work (set up the whole experience etc) and let them know how they can be of help by doing only 10% of the work. Something simple and well-defined that starts off your onboarding process. Inbound leads basically, and &quot;warm introductions&quot;.",1427731324

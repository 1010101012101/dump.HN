You join to defend your family. At least that's the story they spin. Once you buy into the story, it becomes even harder to convince yourself that it's a good idea to leave.<p>I do not claim to know your past. But I know my parents were also poor, and the difference between them and the other kids who were poor around them who never moved up was in their parenting and their education. They ended up in a situation where they could pull out because of that education, and they ended up with certain mindsets that stemmed from the parenting they received. If you don't have one or, often, both of those, you're basically hosed. Not completely, mind you, but the jump needed to pull yourself out of poverty becomes <i>massively</i> bigger. And if you're immersed in a culture where violence is the norm and gangs are the only way to gain serious social acceptance at a young age, you've got even more working against you.<p>I'm really not sure why you're bringing greed into this.

Its considered a hard problem because after 30 years a fast algorithm hasn't been found and a majority of experts think there isn't one. Also, a prime modulus is used for Diffie Hellman since the set {1,2...,p-1} mod p forms a cyclic group (under multiplication) which makes the method as simple as possible. However, a slightly more complicated variation of DH could be used for a composite modulus (where the group is not usually cyclic).",1325482489

At least, it topped the list when I last looked into it as a result of my brother in law having his 1995 Honda Civic stolen from the third floor of a casino parking garage in Las Vegas. This was on Christmas, and his car was full of the presents that he and his family had received that year. They were covered with a blanket and it's unlikely that the thieves knew what they were getting, but they got quite the ""bonus"" from that job. We watched the security camera footage as the thieves walked up to the car and got into it and drove off within 60 seconds. The thieves were not caught and the shell of the car was found a week later abandoned on the side of a road. There was a lesson for my brother in law to not load his presents into his car until he's actually going out the door to begin his eight hour drive back to Reno, but it was a very expensive and very heartbreaking lesson to learn.<p>Please, if anyone knows someone who is willing to do this to another human being, make it stop.

I then decided to switch to Tumblr, which I liked overall, but this was back when they were having erratic downtimes, so I ended up switching to Posterous. I was pretty happy with Posterous for a while, mostly because it let me just email my posts in from anywhere. However, I really don't like the control panel in Posterous. It's such a pain to use for various reasons. I recently switched to running my blog with Jekyll on GitHub, which I am so far very happy with. It's simple, fast, and secure. I can write my posts in any text editor, and just push the changes to github.<p>Overall, if you're a hacker, definitely look at Jekyll (<a href=""https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/</a>). The easiest way to get started is to fork an existing jekyll blog and start customizing.<p>If you're not a hacker, I'd probably recommend Tumblr. It offers the best balance of features and ease of use, and they seem to have solved their downtime problems. If for, some reason, you don't like Tumblr, check out Posterous. If that still doesn't suit your needs, Wordpress.com would be my third recommendation.<p>I would not bother with self-hosted blogs unless you really have a need for that level of control, since the cloud-based or static options are so powerful these days.<p>I also recently discovered OhLife (<a href=""http://ohlife.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ohlife.com/</a>), which is a great way to keep a private journal.

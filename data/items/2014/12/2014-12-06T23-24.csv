I did not want to insult anyone, so I avoided the general term &quot;feminist&quot;, because not all of them want to enforce every aspect of gender-neutral language, which can be quite annoying in a language like German, where everything has a gender. Of course this case (listing women next to wine and singing) is quite extreme.",1417910393

Precision munitions from 30,000 feet?<p>As others have already stated, that&#x27;s pretty much the job of any CAS; go get your butt shot off while trying to destroy the other guy first.<p>Just because MANPADS are becoming more dangerous and more ubiquitous doesn&#x27;t mean that the job of CAS no longer exists, it simply means that the ongoing battle of offense versus defense continues.  You adapt, you move on.<p>If the Air Force wants to create a new, better, A-10 (as the A-10 was a new remake of the A-1), and then retire the A-10, I don&#x27;t think many people would be complaining.  But the fact is, the Air Force keeps coming up with rather asinine, nonsensical, and downright lies about why they should get rid of the A-10, but yet they have nothing to replace it with.<p>The whole argument of &quot;But it&#x27;s a dangerous environment, it might not survive&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite fly when you&#x27;re talking about fighting wars.  That&#x27;s what wars are, dangerous environments in which people might not survive.  It doesn&#x27;t mean that you still don&#x27;t fight them (ignoring the fact that yes, we&#x27;ve certainly have made poor choices in which wars to start/fight in lately).",1417910383
8710673,comment,8709744,8710200,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> That&#x27;s a classic problem (exploration vs exploitation, aka coverage vs convergence) in optimisation problems.<p>The nicest approach to exploration/exploitation I&#x27;ve seen for simulated annealing is to run two searches side-by-side. Their relative &quot;temperatures&quot; (ie. probability of accepting a worse solution) depends on their relative fitness: if both are the same fitness, both have the same temperature; if one has higher fitness than the other, its temperature lowers (so it can &quot;focus&quot; on that high-fitness region) whilst the other&#x27;s temperature raises (so it can &quot;spread out&quot; to find higher-fitness regions).<p>Also, regarding the No Free Lunch Theorems, I don&#x27;t give them much thought since they don&#x27;t take the computational complexity of the problem into account. They say that every search algorithm, when averaged over <i>all</i> problems, achieves total performance that&#x27;s the same as random search. The real world doesn&#x27;t contain <i>all</i> problems; in particular, we care more about (computationally) simple problems than unrealisitically-complex ones. Worrying about NFL for search is like worrying about adversaries with infinite computing power in crypto; yes your algorithm will be weak against such an attacker, but it&#x27;s unrealistic to care about.",1417910376

If you turned issues off and put in the README that you had stopped maintaining the project I&#x27;d think that would be enough.<p>Really, I think once you open source something you should be prepared to maintain it for perhaps somewhere between 3-6 months at a minimum.

Uber&#x27;s profits are extremely lopsided, almost all revenues are generated from just 5 cities with NY heading the list with twice as much revenue as the next city.<p>Given that it makes some sense to try to brand a particular presence in NY. A bit like how a fashion store might want to have a strong presence in Paris. And given NYC alone has a runrate of more than $300m alone, it&#x27;s not strange to approach this as its own market, just like a company might have a US, UK, JP, DE etc domain for those country markets. Only Uber is more city-segmented than country-segmented right now, each city has its own taxi ecosystem and legislation.<p>In any case, it&#x27;d be an easy redirect and for a company worth tens of billions, outspending a $3k bid to get a branded domain for your company&#x27;s largest market makes sense. Even if you don&#x27;t use it, grabbing it and redirecting may be useful.

The tolerances and requirements in rocketry are much more severe, the dimensions unfortunately super-human scale, and the ability to test the system limited by the scale, expense, and speed of the final product, not to mention the usually-100% chance of destroying your machine in the process. (Even reusable systems, which are rare, are expensive to run simply due to scale.)<p>The actual spacecraft part is easy in comparison. It&#x27;s of reasonable dimension, you can test and fiddle with it on the ground, and plenty of common practice is available due to submarines and high-altitude aircraft as well as decades of continuous operation in space.<p>The history of manned space systems will present plenty of examples of the booster being the pacing element. But we don&#x27;t have to look much further than the very system we&#x27;re talking about here. Orion is ready and flying a projected 4 years (and probably longer in reality) before its booster. And that&#x27;s not because they got a head start.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that rockets and manned space craft are similar problem domains; they&#x27;re not. Any expertise SpaceX will need in that area will have to be developed separately. But the techniques are well known (thanks largely to NASA, who make no secret of it) and are just plain not that hard. They&#x27;re already flying a pressurized and temperature-controlled Dragon (which spends time as part of the ISS), and are in development of a crewed one.<p>It is true that SpaceX has yet to operate any space stations, which NASA has, and which are the closest analogues we have to an interplanetary spacecraft. But again, ISS systems are a known quantity, and SpaceX could easily replicate them. Or, if they don&#x27;t want to bother, could contract with Bigelow, who is currently flying two (unmanned) pressurized space stations, with designs for manned versions ready to go and awaiting a way to get there. SpaceX and Bigelow have already announced plans to partner for orbital station operations.<p>A Dragon and a Bigelow station would provide a nice ride to Mars. Getting to the surface and back would be a bit of a problem, but a SpaceX/Bigelow team could possibly land on Phobos and return in the next 5 years. And on a darn low budget, too. If you want to walk on Mars without too much tech development, Dragon 2 should be able to land just as it does on Earth. Dunno how you&#x27;d get back up, though. Maybe you could land a Falcon-ish booster loaded with a storable oxidizer (like peroxide) on little enough juice that it could get back into orbit. Haven&#x27;t looked into the numbers there; F9-1 is certainly single stage to orbit on Mars, but down-and-up on the same fuel load seems unlikely. It&#x27;d certainly work with ISRU propellants, but that&#x27;s a nice can of worms.",1417908865

They pointed out that there&#x27;s a perception in the Arab world that the United States supports status quo regimes which, of course, are brutal and oppressive, and does so in order to secure its own interests in obtaining oil, and then they said, well, it&#x27;s hard to counter this perception because it&#x27;s correct. They said it&#x27;s natural for the United States to link itself up with the status quo regimes and try to sustain them and to pursue its interest in obtaining oil. So the end result is that there&#x27;s a campaign of hatred against us among the people who we&#x27;re basically robbing and on whom we&#x27;re imposing harsh, brutal, repressive and corrupt regimes, and it&#x27;s pretty difficult to counter that campaign.<p>The notion that the US actively fights corrupt, despotic regimes and supports radical movements for democracy doesn&#x27;t rhyme with US history of the past few hundred years. Look at support for Cuban Batista, or support for Chilean Pinochet, support for Iraqi Hussein, for Indonesian Suharto, Spanish Franco, Iranian Mohammed Reza etc. The list is very long.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t want to get into too much of a political discussion. But this notion that US foreign policy (or any country&#x27;s foreign policy for that matter, by the way) is dictated by good will, trying to curb radical movements that sweep away freedom, rather than geopolitics, is clearly missing something. US has practiced realpolitik for a long time now, first under the guise of fighting ideologically different communists, now under the guise of fighting ideologically different islamic extremists. It&#x27;s simply the enemy of the week now, the product of the whole neoliberal clash-of-civilizations movement. The real motivation has always been geopolitics. The US isn&#x27;t unique in this by the way, it&#x27;s just easy to pick out as it&#x27;s been the most successful at this the past 200 years and therefore it has the most stories of supporting crap regimes for its own good will.",1417908724

That is, I think your distillation of his argument misrepresents it by stripping out the logical inconsistencies (and the irony).<p>Montier&#x27;s letter is rather more muddled than your comment. He suggests not only that optimizing returns in the short run is a poor strategy for creating long-term value for shareholders, but that the benchmark of share value (even over the long run) is a deficient measure of corporate performance. Everything Montier writes suggests that he believes companies did better (in some sense that he never quite articulates) in the era when managers ran their firms as they saw fit, before the idea took hold that they should try to maximize share value.<p>So the irony of his argument is the incongruity of demeaning the very benchmark he uses to suggest that J&J has somehow been a better managed company than IBM; the major arc of his argument vitiates the evidence he uses to support it. It is ironic, in the comedic sense, that Montier seems to be so imbedded in the culture of maximizing shareholder value that he invokes that criterion, seemingly reflexively, in the course of his argument against it.<p>But it&#x27;s a logical and rhetorical mess, too. Montier&#x27;s argument is analogous in your maze-solving formulation to claiming that the final distance from the exit is a poor measure of the performance of a maze-solving algorithm while at the same time maintaining that greedy algorithms are worse than random algorithms because it turns out that the greedy ones end up farther from the exit.

And if you notice the list becoming unwieldly then delete them all and start again, you won&#x27;t miss anything, nothing is that important.<p>The same idea applies to many things, remove the impatience of &quot;now!&quot; and it&#x27;s easy to view and prioritize them.

8710565,comment,8709376,8709960,0,0,ANTSANTS,,,"Tonemapping is an essential component of modern video editing and rendering, and for that matter it has been common in photo editing (through the processes of &quot;dodging&quot; and &quot;burning&quot; the film as it was being exposed) since at least the &#x27;40s. Tonemapping is what actually lets you see the depths of light and dark in the same scene without the darkest and brightest parts of the image being completely blown out to black/white. Our pupils control global contrast (average brightness for the entire image) and our retinas can account for some degree of local contrast, so <i>not</i> applying the tonemapping and having i.e. the view from a window appear blindingly white makes things look <i>more</i> unrealistic.<p>(start at page 53) <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/naughty_dog/lighting-shading-by-john-hable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/naughty_dog/lighting-shading-by-jo...</a><p><a href=""http://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/a-closer-look-at-tone-mapping/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/a-closer-look-at...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams</a><p>The Disney Research team purposefully exaggerated their tonemapping far beyond what was aesthetically pleasing in order to clearly demonstrate the artifacts of other tonemapping techniques that their novel approach avoided.

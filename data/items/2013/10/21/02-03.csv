6582999,comment,6580372,6582426,2,0,saraid216,,,"> Why is our collective violence de rigueur but individual violence is immediately presumed to be evil and wrong?<p>The difference is one of authority. Goldman&#x27;s authority to kill isn&#x27;t accepted by society at large, whereas the due process of election, appointment, induction, training, and periodic evaluation <i>is</i> so accepted. You can argue about whether or not that acceptance is a good thing or a bad thing, and Goldman likely felt it was a bad thing, but that acceptance is the fundamental difference.<p>The presumption that individual violence is wrong <i>follows</i> from this systemization of it. When it wasn&#x27;t, we <i>did</i> commit individual violence with no reason. This is rapidly apparent in watching children interact without intervention: they exhibit the full range of human extremes in both cooperating spectacularly but also in conflicting violently. By systematizing it, we&#x27;ve made it rare and remarkable.<p>And because it stands out, it&#x27;s now considered wrong.",1382324341

6582986,story,,,1,0,IshU,"Ask HN: Quit formal education in order to pursue programming?",,"Hi HN.<p>I&#x27;m facing an interesting dilemma in my life, and since the HN community seems to be comprised of self learners and CS grads, which is something  I figured I might ask for advice here.<p>I&#x27;m in my 4th year of my business administration degree. A year ago I picked up python and haven&#x27;t looked back. I&#x27;ve been writing scrapers, parsers, coding minor Django stuff to finance my living costs while I&#x27;m studying.<p>I want to quit my degree.<p>I have two reasonably big local(geographically) Django projects(one is filling up a niche that is almost entirely unsupported, related to ecommerce, the other consists of automating processes at a local company) lined up that would seem to be award me with enough experience to call myself a junior Django developer after I&#x27;m finished with them. Because of studies I can&#x27;t seem to be able to consistently work on my programming projects and, sort of, reach that quantum leap if you will.<p>I need money to finance my studies, but I can only get that while working. I can&#x27;t work properly because I am studying. I am not exaggerating here - I often go days without sleep working on random freelance projects at night and going to class during the day.<p>The rational approach:<p>Cut losses. Quit school and pursue something that has a better cost-benefit ratio than staying in school. Especially, since I&#x27;m planning to make a career out of it eventually. Additionally, I&#x27;m utterly uninterested in my classes, since they&#x27;re mostly management classes(there are some gems in between such as econometrics, comparative econ, but those are fairly hard to come across, since I go to a strict liberal arts college.)<p>The emotional approach:<p>There&#x27;s so much time invested up until now. The culture I live in (eastern europe) is generally very averse to risks and even acknowledging losses. Thus, I must tough it out for another year somehow, and see where that goes.<p>The third option is combining the two and taking academic leave for 6 months and see what that takes me.<p>tl;dr - want to quit school, want to pursue web development, so much time invested in a college education.<p>p.s. I&#x27;m generally a self-learner and classes do almost nothing for me. I prefer plowing through a book rather than going to classes(which is sort of how I acquired my english skills), which I guess makes the case for leaving school.<p>I&#x27;m not seeking sympathy; I&#x27;m seeking advice from industry professionals and what some might consider rather independently thinking people(you know, recurring income, remote work, knowledge work, lifestyle design et cetera).<p>I.",1382324170

6582982,comment,6581253,6582558,5,0,gwern,,,"> My guess would be that the typeface on your site is so small (you&#x27;re running that one now still?) that the lighter font might have made it harder to read.<p>Well, except that the bigger fonts are performing noticeably worse, and it&#x27;s a pretty linear relationship. You can see it in the current simplified-model estimate of -0.002, but it jumps out when plotted: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/SKw3ScN.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/SKw3ScN.png</a> The 100% group performs best, and it just gets worse, even though you wouldn&#x27;t think, say, 105% would be much different from 100%.<p>> Couldn&#x27;t it be that changing all four variables at once will make for a big boost in conversion, but changing one at a time runs into the limitations of the others? For example, increasing font-size by itself will lead to taller paragraphs and more black exposed.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s entirely possible. Actually, it&#x27;s probable that the fitness landscape looks like that. There&#x27;s no reason to expect features to be independent and design so easily optimizable.<p>The problem is, it&#x27;s hard to explore a high-dimensional landscape. Factorial designs, where you test every possible combination and estimate interactions, let you do this, but things can increase, well, factorially. 2x2 isn&#x27;t too bad, but let&#x27;s take just your 3 variables which can be tweaked by CSS: if I use just 4 differing shades of black, 5 font sizes (like the one I&#x27;m running now), and 5 differing line lengths (something like `max-width:`), then that gives me 4x5x5=100 different variants to run, and each one will need something like 1000 page views to start to become accurate, so it would take quite a while to accumulate 100,000 page views. (To put this in perspective, getting to #1 on the HN front page is worth ~20,000 page views.)<p>And that&#x27;s just with 3 changes each with relatively few possible choices. You can see the problem. If you are really worried about interactions and decide to do a full factorial design to explore them, you can quickly get into infeasible sample sizes.",1382324156

The other half is the expectation that 1) threatening something that hurts the country(which he admits) is a good thing if you can pass your political program and 2) the other party will simply fold and its members will pass your program<p>1 simply denies that the opposing party should be able to represent itself in the democratic process but 2 is simply bizarre. No one is going to help their opponents pass their agenda on the basis that if they don&#x27;t the other party will cause the economy to collapse. If that worked, the Soviet Union would have threatened to start a nuclear war anytime they wanted something and would expect the United States to back down.<p>The line of reasoning that validates such a tactic is just totally bizarre. Even if you can get some type of leverage over the other party you will never get enough concessions to justify the economic damage. Economic damage occurs in the present while entitlement spending cuts occur in the future. Even if the economic damage is minimal it seems quite a stretch to assume that statutory changes today are the only way to stop a future congress from overspending.

Unfortunately, such system routines\n    often allow and process a much larger set of formats than those\n    described in Section 3.2.2.\n\n    For example, many implementations allow dotted forms of three\n    numbers, wherein the last part is interpreted as a 16-bit quantity\n    and placed in the right-most two bytes of the network address (e.g.,\n    a Class B network).  Likewise, a dotted form of two numbers means\n    that the last part is interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in\n    the right-most three bytes of the network address (Class A), and a\n    single number (without dots) is interpreted as a 32-bit quantity and\n    stored directly in the network address.  Adding further to the\n    confusion, some implementations allow each dotted part to be\n    interpreted as decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, as specified in the C\n    language (i.e., a leading 0x or 0X implies hexadecimal; a leading 0\n    implies octal; otherwise, the number is interpreted as decimal).\n\n    These additional IP address formats are not allowed in the URI syntax\n    due to differences between platform implementations.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.2</a>:<p><pre><code>    A host identified by an IPv4 literal address is represented in\n    dotted-decimal notation (a sequence of four decimal numbers in the\n    range 0 to 255, separated by &quot;.&quot;), as described in [RFC1123] by\n    reference to [RFC0952].  Note that other forms of dotted notation may\n    be interpreted on some platforms, as described in Section 7.4, but\n    only the dotted-decimal form of four octets is allowed by this\n    grammar.\n\n      IPv4address = dec-octet &quot;.&quot; dec-octet &quot;.&quot; dec-octet &quot;.&quot; dec-octet\n\n      dec-octet   = DIGIT                 ; 0-9\n                  / %x31-39 DIGIT         ; 10-99\n                  / &quot;1&quot; 2DIGIT            ; 100-199\n                  / &quot;2&quot; %x30-34 DIGIT     ; 200-249\n                  / &quot;25&quot; %x30-35          ; 250-255\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123</a><p><pre><code>    Whenever a user inputs the identity of an Internet host, it SHOULD\n    be possible to enter either (1) a host domain name or (2) an IP\n    address in dotted-decimal (&quot;#.#.#.#&quot;) form.

Since the Kindle OS counts as an incompatible version of Android, no major OEM is allowed to produce the Kindle Fire for Amazon. So when Amazon goes shopping for a manufacturer for its next tablet, it has to immediately cross Acer, Asus, Dell, Foxconn, Fujitsu, HTC, Huawei, Kyocera, Lenovo, LG, Motorola, NEC, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba, and ZTE off the list. Currently, Amazon contracts Kindle manufacturing out to Quanta Computer, a company primarily known for making laptops.

A smaller individual insurance plan<p>* Has to pay more for drugs (less bargaining power vs a big plan)<p>* Has more statistical risk (# people goes with N, stdev in # people with a given illness goes with sqrt(N), so risk/person goes with sqrt(N)/N and larger plans have less risk)<p>* Has larger legal/consulting overhead<p>* Forces doctors to incur overhead with nonstandard forms<p>* Is vulnerable to the bandwagon effect (if, by accident, it happens to favor X group of costly individuals, the costly individuals proceed to pile on and sink the plan)<p>* Has the ability to discriminate based on fine-grained geographical knowledge and other factors<p>* Has an under-leveraged customer base (if the plan is &quot;secretly evil&quot; and dumps people who need expensive treatment and 1% of people require expensive treatment, a 100 person plan will have 0 or maybe 1 person being screwed at any given time, while a 10000 person plan will have ~100 people being screwed who are much more able to band together and fight a legal/PR battle)<p>Previously, small plans were able to flourish because of #6 and #7, incurring #1-5 as costs of doing business. This was bad for everyone except insurance companies. The best way to turn a profit in the insurance industry is to sell insurance priced for a medium-risk person to a low-risk individual(or hi-risk price to a medium-risk person). If you look closely, this kind of &quot;innovation&quot; is actually just restoring the pre-insurance reality of charging sick people a lot and healthy people very little. It defeats the purpose of insurance while increasing costs (#1-5) and letting the people in charge of the purpose-defeating process pocket a hefty cut of the proceeds by fooling people into buying overpriced coverage.<p>Exchanges are designed to put an end to the tragedy of the commons. The savings from #1-5 can be recouped at the expense of eliminating #6 and #7, which were perverse incentives anyway.<p>Even if you disagree with my explanations, it is objectively true that employer plans are much more efficient than individual plans (E(payout)/E(cost) is larger). You can then see the ACA exchanges as an attempt to reform individual plans to emulate employer plans. Of course, it remains &quot;cargo cult economics&quot; unless you can figure out why you expect the emulation to close the gap in value, which is what I was doing with the list in the first place. In other words: I have provided 7 possible explanations that I think make sense but there are even more out there which I don&#x27;t agree with and haven&#x27;t listed.",1382320978

I don&#x27;t really know what the solution is, but there seems to be a very hard line in RMS&#x27;s mind as to what the domain of &quot;hacking&quot; can be. He&#x27;s extremely clever, a hacker, and a genius in certain areas (the GPL is such an amazing hack) but at the same time keeps banging his head against the wall using failed strategies instead of trying to hack his way to a solution. When was the last time you heard about something RMS did in the way he presented his ideas to be more receptive to others and thought &quot;hey, that is pretty clever and a nice hack.&quot; I certainly can&#x27;t think of anything, but he&#x27;s clearly capable of doing it.<p>I think he probably has some personal moral code that prohibits him from trying to hack systems above a certain level of abstraction. Computers and security policies are below it, people&#x27;s minds, emotions, and opinions are out of reach. In other words, the art of marketing is completely outside it.<p>YC on the other hand has a much higher bar for what is hackable, including things like getting user growth through clever marketing and viral loops, and keeping your startup solvent by selling breakfast cereal. RMS wouldn&#x27;t go near these types of things, but they are in line with the hacking ethos.",1382320977

At the risk of sounding reckless, unless the app needs to support high CUD throughput I sometimes opt for sqlite. Doesn&#x27;t get much easier than that and it&#x27;s read performance is impressive from what I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Even then you can sometimes get away with staying on sqlite for your admin side CRUD and redis for the heavy / concurrent writing from the public facing side (obviously situational).",1382320948

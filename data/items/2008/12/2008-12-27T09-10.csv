America has a wide number of skilled labourers, not just in the prominent professions like engineers and doctors, but also things like human resources, accounting, etc. There is massive skill value in the U.S, and even if there were a total destruction of the money markets, the skills are not going anywhere, making it very easy to recreate industries. China does not have the same - they have a large quantity of unskilled labour.<p>Most electronic components are produced in China. If China decides to increase their currency, their electronics will get expensive, and phillipines, malaysia, thailand will be happy to take over this role.<p>Political unrest is really the least problem we face right now. Since I was born in 1980, I cannot remember a time when the news had so little conflict.<p>I'm not saying the U.S is perfect, the U.S has big problems. What I think the root cause of the problems is is that a lot of power is given to big companies. It's a sort of self-sustaining monopoly. Americans are now looking upwards - look at big VC companies to give them money, look at corporations for jobs. Small to medium business should be the backbone of any company, not massive shareholder companies.",1230370401

It's sort of a definitional thing--there isn't much way around it. Perhaps the author would have been better changing his thesis into an argument in favor of such a revision for the specific case of Florida and the telecoms.""<p>I don't agree. What do you call a situation where the original investors go bust because most of the benefits accrue not directly from their investments but from spillover effects? Calling it helpful effects of a bubble is not a bad way to describe it, I think.<p>But even so, this doesn't answer the question of whether the bubble had a positive overall effect. The author of the article isn't mentioning the dampening effect of busts on the willingness to take on risks down the road. It's not just the wasteful use of resources during the bubble that has a negative macro economic effect. On the other hand, the feeling that you can get rich in a bubble if you get out in time increases the hunger for risk. Maybe not for the right kind of risk though.<p>Anyway, it's very hard to make macro economic calculations like this. There are so many more factors that haven't been mentioned and surely there are some of those unknown unknowns lurking somewhere as well :-)",1230369396

410925,comment,410593,410709,0,0,jbjohns,,,"Actually it is patent law that's messed up. US patent law, anyway.  It's not that patents shouldn't exist, of course they should in some form.  And I disagree that the problem is with the examiners.  People always say that more money needs to be invested to have specialists from every field doing the examining, but this is a waste of time.  The point of the patent office is to deal with merging new technologies and fields, by definition they will always be behind.<p>The best thing would be to simply lower the cost of invalidating a patent.  For example, in the UK anyone can challenge a patent without having to go to court.  Just forward your prior art evidence to the patent office and when it is verified the patent becomes invalid.<p>I know of cases where individuals have gotten patents invalidated for things didn't compete with their business or affect them in any way.  They challenged the patent just on the grounds that it was false (i.e. the owner of the patent didn't invent the idea).<p>The mistake the US makes is this idea that <i>everything</i> has to be proved/disproved by the court system.  That's way to expensive and way too much trouble for things like patents.  There are so many laws, patents and so on that shouldn't exist, but do because no one has been willing to challenge it in court to get it thrown out.",1230368880

I've had it for 2 years, moved cross country twice in it, and I still love it more every time I drive. The attention to every little detail is astounding. What makes you love it are the little things you wouldn't even think matter that much like the backup camera (I laughed at this and let me tell you, I couldn't live without it now), rain sensing wipers, automatic lights that turn on and off themselves and turn with you as you steer, ample cupholders including one by a vent so you can keep your drink warm in the winter, ability to save seat positions and revert to them with one button push, homelink garage door built in, variable temperature seat warmer, phenomenal traction control (I drove 9 hours home in a blizzard once, laughing at all of the cheaper cars swerving uncontrollably off the road), the suspension that makes railroad tracks nearly unnoticeable, seats so comfortable I'm trying to figure out how to get one for my office. I could go on and on.<p>And their GPS is unbeatable. Now when I rent a car, I get those Garmins and just end up pissed at how unusable they are. I test drove an Accura and the GPS crashed on me.<p>Despite being an SUV, it's fast enough that anything faster would just get me into trouble. I laugh at douchebags who have racing spoilers on their Civic, since me in my soccer mom car could smoke them off the line.<p>And you'll be able to fit luggage for 4 with ease. Buy that car, you won't regret it. The total cost of ownership is surprisingly low for the sticker price given Lexus's value retention and craftsmanship. I'm pretty sure mine was just under $50k fully loaded.",1230368700

That one black mark is plenty for a determined administrator to get her fired.  That a balanced review process would show see is a good teacher is simply immaterial.  At least, that is how teachers see things.<p>Part of the reason you see so much backlash from teacher's unions against these initiatives (despite the fact that virtually all teachers acknowledge that some are better than others, and have a pretty fair idea who the worst ones are) is that they don't see this as a way to fairly evaluate teachers and improve the quality of education.  Rather, they see it as a weapon to be wielded by school districts, school administrators, and angry parents (""Mrs. X told little Johnny (age: 17) where babies come from!"" ""Mr. Y is a member of $MARGINALIZED_SUBGROUP!"" ""Ms. Z believes something that is the current scientific consensus""  ""Mr. Q gave my son an A-"") against unpopular teachers.  It is an unfortunate fact of life, and even more unfortunate that so few are willing to admit it (especially here on HN, where the quality of discussion is usually above average).<p>We would probably have much greater buy-in from teaching unions if these evaluations were perceived as something other than politics as usual.  Unfortunately, the proposals all seem to keep a some level of human involvement in the firing process (so only the very most outstanding teachers are immune to the usual political pressures).  It's useful at this point to recall a bit of history: Teachers today are so hard to fire because they have tenure.  Teaching unions successfully forced tenure the tenure system on school districts because school administrators of the past abused their authority to fire good teachers who happened to be politically unpopular.",1348447430

4562671,comment,4562211,4562211,2,0,chrismorgan,,,"I see both pros and cons in the Go approach.<p>I find Python's exceptions model to be something that <i>does</i> occasionally frustrate me. For example, I'm used to using NSIS for some things (the PortableApps.com Launcher being one thing); its model is that a command may set the global error flag. This means that some sorts of things will fail silently - occasionally bad, but generally good. Some styles of Python scripts (generally automation scripts rather than full-blown programs) would do much better ignoring most errors. When you have a script merrily chugging along and all of a sudden due to some obscure corner case (perhaps not even documented) in a small, incidental part of the script the <i>whole thing</i> quits, it can be rather annoying.<p>The Go approach lets you catch errors if you want, or drop them, much more easily than Python approach. My inclination at present is that the Go approach is more likely to end up with error-resilient code, as it encourages dealing with errors each time, while Python typically encourages you to let the caller deal with an exception if you can't - but often I think the caller doesn't realise that he should. Or after a couple of levels of indirection, it's not even documented that that exception can occur. (This sort of thing, I believe, is something that Java's checked exceptions were supposed to help with - either deal with the exception or declare it.)<p>For myself, I've had lots of experience with Python and am now dabbling with Go, using it for two smaller projects to decide which to use for my next major project. At the very least, I think the approach is worthwhile trying in a serious project that its merits and those of the Python approach may be more completely analysed.",1348446926

My work in molecular dynamics has convinced me that we aren't too far away from enough computing power to completely <i>simulate</i> many phenomena that are too complex to otherwise understand.<p>Biology in particular is very complex, and I'm not entirely sure researchers can come up with models that are subtle and complete enough to accurately describe significant processes without becoming too mind-boggling for a human mind to grasp.<p>On the other hand, if you can just simulate all these processes, drug development becomes a series of algorithms that optimize the desired effect while minimizing undesired effects.<p>Some types of technology will require quantum computers.  To simulate a system of N qubits using a classical computer requires 2^N states which quickly overpowers even the most advanced supercomputers.  But if we can make even rudimentary quantum computers our simulation efforts will be significantly advanced (hey, we can factor the number 21, so it's a start!).<p>To give you an idea of the current state of simulation research, we still require a lot of approximation models.  What would you do if you wanted the most accurate simulation of a system you could get?  Well, you would create one wavefunction of all the particles in the system and simulate its time evolution (Dirac equation).<p>Of course, we can barely do this for simple atoms right now, so instead combinations of experimental data and basic QM simulations are used to get information about atomic/molecular interactions.  For a large molecular system, these interactions are studied to create a new approximation model (like coarse-grain simulations).  The problem is that each higher abstraction loses touch with experimental reality.  Current biological simulations are really only ""suggestive"" instead of predictive.  On the other hand, argon and nitrogen simulations match up almost exactly with experimental data.<p>Again, as computing power develops, less abstractions will be necessary and simulations will become closer and closer to their experimental counterparts.<p>To give an analogy for some of you computer graphics people, consider the huge number of ""tricks"" used in rasterization engines for video games to make the images look photorealistic.  However, even a simple global illumination algorithm (bidirectional path tracing, photon mapping, Metropolis light transport) give incredibly realistic results but require far more time.  It's a tradeoff between models (hard to come up with good ones) and computational capacity (but doesn't require much thinking).",1348446196

Web frameworks usually catch exceptions that arise while a request is being handled, finish the request, and keep handling new requests.

4562603,comment,4562211,4562211,1,0,ericbb,,,"On the topic of when to use error-returns vs. when to use panic:<p>I struggled with this aspect of Go coding too and what I decided was that, in order to choose your approach to errors, you should think about how important it is that your function can be composed into an expression:<p><pre><code>    x := foo(a) + bar(b)
</code></pre>
vs.<p><pre><code>    c, err := foo(a)
    if err != nil {
        ...
    }
    d, err := bar(b)
    if err != nil {
        ...
    }
    x := c + d
</code></pre>
It's a trade-off. By using ""panic"", you enable more concise and compositional code. By using error-returns, you are being more explicit and making it easier for the caller to handle errors at the call-site.<p>Usually, functions that can fail are not the kind you desperately want to use in expressions anyway. So error-returns are more common. But there are many situations where errors can happen and where composition is a big win. In those cases, you reach for ""panic"".<p>If you look at some of the built-ins that can panic--I'm thinking of array-indexing and division and regexp.MustCompile(), for example--you notice that these would become very cumbersome if they used error-returns instead.<p>There's also the issue of initialization. That's the justification given in the case of regexp.MustCompile(). An initializer must be a single expression.<p>The words ""panic"" and ""error"" probably lead people to think that you should make the decision based on severity but I don't think that's right.<p>(That's just my take on it. I'm no Go expert so there are likely better ways to think about it.)",1348444973

4562599,comment,4561533,4562514,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"I probably wouldn't consider it. When it comes to how people react to injustice, shallowness, stupidity (such as age discrimination) there are exploders and exploiters. Exploiters figure out how to use peoples' superficiality, stupidity, and moral deficiency to their benefit. Exploders get angry and try to rally the good to the cause-- they're the whistleblowers.<p>I'm an exploder, not an exploiter. It's my nature. I'm way too honest and blunt to be an exploiter. (Fuck, here I am being honest about the fact that I don't think dishonestly is always bad and that for many minor forms of it, even though I could never pull them off myself, I'm ethically OK with it.)<p>But ask your local Googler whether I'd recommend whistleblowing as a career move.<p>In movies, people like exploders and whistleblowers, but in real life, people think of exploders as a pain in the ass (killing the messenger) while exploiters get ahead. I used to think that exploiters were all unethical, but I've come to realize that some people can be exploiters without being harmful or unethical.",1348444892

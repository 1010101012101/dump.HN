It looks a lot like an NOC, actually.<p>Finding people to drive trucks for 100k+ is actually not <i>that</i> hard. You basically advertise a job: &quot;drive trucks. Make big bucks&quot; and people flock to it.<p>But getting 2 or 3 different people to drive the same truck in shifts, and accommodating them, and flying them in and out, and feeding them ... it adds up. To an overhead that could run past a million dollars per year, per truck. And if you have an idle truck, that&#x27;s lost money.<p>But it&#x27;s not even the money. Rio, like BHP Billiton, enjoys <i>insane</i> free cashflow right now.<p>It&#x27;s about protecting production from union activity.<p>In the 80s the Western Australian mining industry was repeatedly crippled by huge fights between the mining giants and the unions, particularly the quite-militant CFMEU. A mix of legislative changes by a long-serving conservative government beginning in the mid 90s, plus generous individual contracts, broke the unions&#x27; grip on mining. And just in time for the mining boom.<p>In 2007 a Labor government was elected and dramatically tilted the legislative tables back in favour of the unions. Then the GFC struck with full force and it so happened that Rio had <i>just</i> prior to it borrowed heavily to buy assets at the top of the market. So any prolonged interruption to production would be death.<p>And so Rio have moved to make their mining operations as union-proof as possible. Automatic trucks is part of it. The ore trains too, parts of their port systems ... everything that can be made autonomous and/or remote is being made autonomous and remote.",1377395832

6270556,comment,6270436,6270436,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I am a Distributist, which is a sort of &quot;post-Capitalism&quot; approach that started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries largely as a critique of both Capitalism and Marxism.  I totally agree with the need for a post-Capitalistic view, but we have to be careful to define what Capitalism is and what the alternatives are.<p>Distributism has evolved a lot over the years.  There are a lot more non-Catholic distributists these days (I am a Heathen, for example).<p>The definition I like to give is this:  Capitalism is the system where people with capital buy land, build facilities, buy tools, and hire labor in order to start businesses.  Therefore Capitalism necessarily reduces to ownership of the means of production by the financier.  This leads naturally enough to control over production.  Since, as Belloc noted in 1914, control over economic production amounts to life itself, Capitalism means that the financial class ends up controlling life for everyone else.  This concentration of power is unhealthy.<p>Of course the Marxists think we can solve this problem by taking away that control from the financiers and placing it in the hands of an even fewer number of bureaucrats (something Belloc also pointed out in 1914), and Belloc was mostly right in what he saw as the consequences of that.<p>What we need to understand is that what is necessary is the option of self-employment being open.  We have vast amounts of policies from complex tax frameworks (SSTP) to means testing in welfare which prevents this.<p>The Distributist narrative is different:<p>Businesses are built collaboratively by workers working and those with capital financing what is necessary.  Workers are the business although financiers should have some interest in things too.  The best business is one where the workers and the financiers are on the same team.  The ideal businesses are the family businesses.<p>Anyway such a move would require a lot of rethinking our current approaches to economic inequality.  The estate tax should be considered harmful because it privileges corporations over unincorporated family businesses.  Other tax approaches should be used instead.  Our anti-poverty programs are ways to chain the poor to low-paying jobs and a way to subsidize cheap labor, and we should redesign them along different lines.<p>(Interestingly enough, venture-capital-stage startups are more distributist than large corporations because the employees tend to have a larger share of ownership in the business, and a greater level of personal empowerment to change things.  The only problem is with exit strategies ;-).)",1377395451

It tried to associate but didn&#x27;t wait long enough.<p>I ran it with the &quot;-v&quot; option and saw a line that said something like:<p>&quot;Waiting 5 seconds&quot;.<p>I downloaded the source code and searched for that message:<p>grep -r Waiting * | grep second<p>I got 5 results or so.  I opened up the code and I saw a line like this, right above the debug message.<p>timeout = 5000;<p>I added a 0 (making it 50 seconds) and saved the file. I ran ./configure && make and killed /usr/bin/wpa_supplicant, then used my copy and like magic, it started working. Go me!<p>I think any average non-wizard programmer could have probably done the same.  I didn&#x27;t have to know all any big-picture detail of wpa_supplicant&#x27;s design nor did I have to know the 802.11[anything] protocol.  No need to do packet dissection or anything like that.<p>I looked at the screen, I grepped for where the problem was and I added a 0.  Fixed.<p>It took all of 20 minutes or so. A lot less time then the productivity I had already lost by putting up with the issue in the first place. [1]<p>Those kinds of experiences are the kind that make me stick with linux.<p>I have an identical problem with the same networks on my s3.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because of the same thing.  But my stock install of the developer-unfriendly OS has made the barrier to doing the same process much much higher.<p>I had a different, but also easily solvable problem on a MBP once in 2012.  I tried the same process.  But the man pages were half a page long and dated 10 years ago.  The developer documentation was non-existent, the source code was inaccessible, and everyone that was experiencing the problem were unsophisticated users who recommended things like &quot;going to the mac store&quot;.<p>Basically, I was stuck with the problem.  I would have had to have been in my top form hacking zone to even find out what and where to mod; and then I&#x27;d have to write assembly to fix it; using tricks to maintain byte alignment, function pointers, all that noise.<p>After a few experiences like that I realized the machine in my hands was a sophisticated consumer appliance.<p>That&#x27;s nice. But what I really wanted was a &quot;feasibly reprogrammable&quot; computer.<p>---<p>[1] Here&#x27;s another example: I had an idea for a way to switch application windows where you type in string matches of the window names, all these weird UI ideas... The problem was I couldn&#x27;t program in X - I had no idea how to do that.<p>Good thing is that I didn&#x27;t need to.  Because of the openness of the system, I was able to execute my idea with a perl script; calling programs to move around and manipulate windows.<p>The existing tools gave me enough control, power, and information, in order to execute this sophisticated idea; and all without having to learn xlib (which I intend to do one day). It&#x27;s become part of my must-have list for my long-term environments. Here&#x27;s the link <a href=""https://github.com/kristopolous/alttab"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kristopolous/alttab</a> . I still don&#x27;t know exactly how to create an x window.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that although initially daunting, the &quot;here&#x27;s the blueprints&quot; philosophy of linux actually makes sophisticated ideas simpler to execute, however counter-intuitive that sounds.",1377395444

6270534,comment,6269332,6270346,2,0,rdtsc,,,"I agree with you, hopefully you see that, but hopefully you can also see why for heavily IO bound application event based systems (basically code woven around a giant epoll/select/poll/kqueue system call) <i>can</i> be faster.<p>Modern machines are different than those 10-15 years ago. Caches and SMP typologies sometimes play serious roles in what could be an outcome of a benchmark. Threads are often heavyweight memory-wise. That is why the 10K problem had started to be solved better by event based systems.<p>Even looking at your benchmarks link, I would say more on the top are actually event based. &quot;cpoll&quot; ones look like event based centered around a polling loop. So is openresty -- which is a set of Lua modules working in nginx, also an evented server (but it is also mixed with a set of worker processes from what I understand).<p>And I like what you said about even if they are the same threaded ones are better. Yes. Not only that, for me it is 10x. Even if threaded ones are 10x slower and that is tolerable, the I would rather pick that. Why? Because code is clearer and matches better which the intuitive breakdown of a problem domain. That is why I like Erlang, Go, Rust and Akka -- actor models just model the world better (a single request is sequential there are clear steps that work in one after another to process it, but there is concurrency between each requests). An actor models that perfectly and I like that.<p>I also, like you, dealt with an evented promises/futures based system for years and it wasn&#x27;t fun.

The Windows Install is Windows 8 (ala Bizspark) and currently runs a BitNami DjangoStack with Aptana Studio 3 and Notepad++ (Web Dev), as well as the free Visual Studio 2013 Dev Suite (just messing with that for now). The Linux install is Ubuntu Desktop 12.0.4 LTS and I use it for Design with Gimp and Inkscape. The OSX install is an older osx86 release of 10.5.2 (Leopard) and that was just more for fun, not really used for Dev or any work because it&#x27;s such an old version and will not run any recent versions of Xcode. The only real problems I had were with WIFI and USB Support on the Linux / OSX front (but I got those fixed).

6270462,comment,6270254,6270345,4,0,davidhollander,,,"To me the most important factor for developing on a laptop mentioned in the article is the use of a tiling window manager.<p>For me an incredibly common task in web development is to have a web browser and 1 or more terminal windows tiled horizontally, side by side, in an [ A | B ] or [ A | [ B | C ]] configuration, where A is a web browser, and B and C are terminals.<p>In order for this to work for me on a screen resolution <= 1920x1080, the ratio ( width of A ) / ( width of screen ) should be dynamically adjustable using a single key combo, without causing window overlapping. If this ratio is fixed, and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the window manager, I experience one or more of the following problems at any given moment:<p>1. the web browser window is too narrow, causing wide documents to be clipped and a horizontal scroll bar to appear.<p>2. A terminal window is wider than 80 characters, causing unnecessary screen area to be consumed which could be better allocated toward the web browser.<p>3. A terminal window is less than 80 characters in width, preventing the entire line of code from being displayed.<p>To me Linux is the ideal laptop OS because it&#x27;s the easiest OS to install a tiling window manager on, and a tiling window manager is what maximizes the platform&#x27;s primary constraint: small screen area.",1377393056

I&#x27;m a Mac user, and ever since Snow Leopard, Apple has been continually removing features for power users such as true two-dimensional workspaces support and excellent window management in favor of a Frankensteinian nightmare called Mission Control. Changing the OS&#x27; appearance requires hacking and reverse-engineering, and Apple has continued to put in consumer-friendly features that are useless for a power user. Launchpad is ridiculous. The iOS apps ported over are unnecessary bloat. The removal of Save As in favor of automatic versioning for those who don&#x27;t know how to use Command-S drives many mad. The removal of scrollbars as default should be heresy.<p>Most of these things can be solved with preferences and a bunch of &quot;defaults write&quot;s, but it just solidifies the reasoning behind that statement.<p>Let&#x27;s not even start with the hardware. Apple&#x27;s decision to remove antiglare and high-res, 1:1 pixel panels (non-Retina) is egregious. The removal of upgradeability for the sake of 2mm in thickness has to be one of the most short-sighted and absurd decisions I&#x27;ve ever seen a company make.<p>So, he&#x27;s right. With Mavericks, the trend seems to be changing, and I hope it does, but for now, I&#x27;ll reserve my judgment until it releases officially.<p>What&#x27;s also more depressing is that in an attempt to chase consumers, pro manufacturers are making the same awful hardware decisions Apple made, while alienating their true markets.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me?

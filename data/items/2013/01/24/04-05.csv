I cant help but think of potential future employers that are no longer potential.</i><p>There's a big responsibility that comes with being well-liked and nice.  When someone with a good reputation and the means to broadcast it speaks negatively about someone, it matters much more than someone who is routinely rude, frequently negative, or unknown. I know that if the most well-liked and nice person in my lab were to criticize my ability as a scientist (in the same manner), I would worry about what everyone else thought about me now, that someone who never seems to say mean things would so something like that.<p>These individuals do good things: they contribute voluntarily to communities, they help high school kids learn to code, etc. And these individuals are visible. And if you search steveklabnik on HN, his comments don't seem mean or negative.<p>It's easy to forget, and it's a little paradoxical, but when you're really nice, there's a different standard. Perhaps there shouldn't be, but it does have a different impact.",1359003593

Damned if it doesn't take 30 lines of XML to do it in maven, but these kinds of see-spot-run situations are pretty easy.<p>Extremely difficult in maven and five minutes work in make or ant is things like ""running LaTeX to generate a PDF of some of your documentation, because it is math laden and HTML isn't suitable"".  This is not theoretical; I had to do this at the place that was using maven and we depended on some semi-obscure mathematical formalisms like the stable distribution.<p>Intermediate between these two is driving things with maven plugins, which is either easy (because you're doing something trivial) or fiendishly difficult because the debugging output is terrible, the docs are worse and the only thing left to you is to Use The Source, Luke.  Every nontrivial maven plugin I've ever used has tripped this at some point, be it loading config files, including the dependencies, or something else.",1359003542
5107470,comment,5105164,5106841,12,0,gizmo686,,,"My understanding of dasil003's point is that it is not a complaint about IDEs, but rather about languages that are designed in such a way as to require IDEs. For example, in Java, if you want to sort a List by a given field (using the Native Collections.sort method), you would need to do something like:<p>Collections.sort(myList, new new Comparator<E>() {\npublic int compare(E o1, E o2) {\n return 01.val-02.val\n}\n}<p>(You could also make your class implement Comparable, but then you need to own the class, have only one ordering used in the entire program, not mind making the ordering a property of the class).<p>If you are in an IDE, then writing all that out is not to bad because of auto complete. If you are stuck in a plain-text editor, you would much prefer something like:\nCollections.sort(myList, lambda<E->int> x->x.val);<p>Java 8 does incluse lambda's, so maybe this particlar case has been solved. But languages with a strong CLI pressense in the community tend to need alot less IDE than languages with a strong IDE pressense in the community.",1359003539

5107451,comment,5105928,5107404,2,0,rayiner,,,"> Why is this like sneaking into a factory and not like reading a list of their other customers' email addresses that AT&T has mistakenly printed on the back of everyone's billing statement?<p>Because it requires intentional effort to find information that is intended to be private. It requires you to ""walk through the door."" The digital equivalent of your scenario is if AT&T accidentally e-mailed their customer list to everyone along with their e-bills.<p>> I still think the whole notion of ""unauthorized access"" is the wrong way to go. If someone breaks into your computer and intentionally deletes your data, vandalism. If they take credit card numbers and use or sell them, identity theft. So on and so forth. If all they do is fiddle with a URL or prove to you that your security is not what you thought it was without damaging anything or committing any other crime, why does that have to be a crime in itself?<p>I disagree. I don't think the digital world should be treated any differently than the real world. In the real world, we enforce boundaries in their own right, with minimal penalties unless it is accompanied by another crime. We do so to discourage people from poking around where they shouldn't, because such poking around is highly correlated with actual crime. Allowing people to poke around freely makes enforcement hard. Everyone who actually did something wrong is going to claim ""oh I was just poking around."" This rationale translates just fine into the digital world.<p>> It seems like all that does is chill the propensity for security experts to point out vulnerabilities when they see them<p>Why can't security researchers get consent from their subjects to do experiments on them, like every other kind of researcher? Should my doctor be allowed to test his pet theories on me while treating unrelated conditions, on a ""no harm no foul"" basis?",1359003263

The bigger problems are:<p>1) The trains don't run nearly often enough. If you happen to miss one or need to go at a non-peak time, it is going to be really inconvenient.<p>2) Not only does much of our population live in suburbs, a large amount of jobs are located outside of downtown, too.

That's part of the problem: I think legutierr is on to something with the issue that every time we talk about the CFAA we try to come up with strained analogies, because we can't conceptualize why the specific thing that someone did to a computer is wrong. Why is this like sneaking into a factory and not like reading a list of their other customers' email addresses that AT&T has mistakenly printed on the back of everyone's billing statement?<p>I still think the whole notion of ""unauthorized access"" is the wrong way to go. If someone breaks into your computer and intentionally deletes your data, vandalism. If they take credit card numbers and use or sell them, identity theft. So on and so forth. If all they do is fiddle with a URL or prove to you that your security is not what you thought it was without damaging anything or committing any <i>other</i> crime, why does that have to be a crime in itself? It seems like all that does is chill the propensity for security experts to point out vulnerabilities when they see them, for fear that embarrassing the system's operator will result in retaliatory pressing of charges, and give prosecutors a catch all to charge people with when they can't make a case based on anything else.<p>This is almost a case in point. These defendants are royal jerks. They're sitting around contemplating everything from blackmail to securities fraud, but in this specific case it doesn't seem like they've actually done anything like that, just talked about it like pompous idiots. So they get charged with the CFAA, because it catches almost everybody whether they've really done anything or not, even though from what I can tell all they actually did was publicize that AT&T's poor security was putting AT&T's customers' personal information at risk.

I would take your argument a step further and explain that mvn fits into common development workflows much the same tr fits into the word-counting example.  Mvn is composable.<p>Let me illustrate what we do at work to explain.  We use Jenkins as a build server and a hosted git repository.  Every accepted pull request to mainline-dev is picked up by Jenkins, Jenkins runs mvn test on the commit, if the build passes, Jenkins integrates the change into mainline-stable, and Jenkins runs mvn deploy to get the latest build on a mainline-stable server.<p>Setting up this workflow required little customization because mvn's output was well-defined and designed to be <i>composed within other environments</i>, and jenkins is one common place that understands it.  So are the IDEs at your work.  So is the next person to tweak the environment who can look at docs to figure out what's going on.  It's no different than how sed knows how to interpret tr's text output.<p>Does this workflow work for everyone and every language?  No, not at all.  Does mvn the tool work for everyone and every language?  No.  But I see it as an example how mvn, a build tool, fits into larger process and is a composable tool the author lauds.<p>P.S. The biggest benefit for our shop is twofold:<p>1) Dependencies get resolved automatically in all environments.  Unlike my last gig, developers run the same version of libraries as the prod machines do.<p>2) Developers run the same test cases locally as jenkins does.  We've only had one build break.",1359002595

Because of the impressive lighting effects it's famous for producing, people view it as some ""holy grail"" of superior computer graphics technology that we just need to optimize a bit for use in games.<p>As Carmack described, those highly realistic ray traced renders come at a price: <i>billions</i> of ray calculations. You don't get all that pixel-perfect refraction, etc. for free (and probably never will - at least not with ray tracing.) He also explains that for most people, this (e.g. pixel perfect refraction) really doesn't matter, when rasterization techniques exist that achieve extremely high quality approximations at a fraction of the computational cost.<p>Conversely though, ray tracing and related concepts (ray casting) are not at all without value. Many modern video games today actually use a sort of hybrid rasterization / ray casting approach. Macrostructure objects are rasterized the normal way, while smaller high resolution detail patterns (like a brick wall, or stones in the ground) are ""added"" to surfaces via per-pixel displacement mapping, which is ray casting at its core. This is one of the few cases where you can take advantage of the ""log2"" efficiency Carmack mentioned -- in a highly specialized implementation without a huge time constant.",1359002253

Gang activity is directly linked to the money involved in the drug trade. So the best technological approach to reducing gun violence would be one that took all the money out of the drug trade, giving the gangsters less to shoot at each other over. There is precedent for this. The fact that crime, including violent crime and violent crime committed with firearms, is so low now compared to the 80's and early 90's is directly linked to the collapse in the price of cocaine.<p>We've made it almost impossible to stop everyday copyright infringement, why not make it almost impossible to stop physical smuggling or fabrication of narcotics? Commoditize the gangsters straight out of business. Part of what made the bottom fall out of cocaine was crystal meth. So there's one direction: freely distribute the information and materials necessary to manufacture competing drugs. Then there's the distribution: Silk Road is a start, but find a better way of doing it that will pull in more producers, consumers, and distributors.

This can lead to improved policing: e.g., if it's found that firearms used in Los Angeles come via straw-purchases from Arizona, then police attention can be directed to CA/AZ border.<p>2) For classes of firearm owners that are licensed or registered (CCW in different states, handgun owners in some states, NFA), it may be helpful to keep track of what licensing procedures were used, the demographics of the owners, the type of firearm, and then correlate this with any crime involving either the firearm or the owner -- using this as a feedback loop to improve licensing and registration laws. E.g., if it is found that there is no significant difference in terms of incidents/accidents with CCW holders that had 15 hours of training vs. 30 hours of training, there's no point in maintaining the 30 hour training requirement.<p>3) I think 1 and 2 need significant buy-in from gun owners, manufacturers, law-enforcement officers, and gun rights group. When the previous scientific studies come out with proposals these three groups (whose buy in crucial) find non-sensical (for very good reasons) and backed by poor data, that leads to loss of trust and the belief that studies that find facts contrary to a pre-conceived agenda will not be permitted.<p>It makes perfect sense, for example, for CDC to investigate gun violence -- yet given the previously shoddy and biased studies on this matter, the significant stake holders are less likely to cooperate. This, in turn, leads to lower quality data, further perpetuating the cycle.<p>So if a group can manage to persuade congress to drop wildly unpopular and non-sensical measures (like Feinstein's semi-automatic ""assault weapon"" ban proposal), they have far better credibility for starting a  conversation with the stake-holders.<p>Law enforcement, for example, have often found ways to work with organizations like the ACLU to ensure due process is observed, when implementing legislation opposed by those organizations. There's no reason why SAF, NRA, as well as ACLU (in regards to avoiding racial profiling, protecting the rights of mentally ill, and other first/fourth/fifth amendment issues -- especially with the #1 ""tracking"" proposal) should not play a role in a more in depth data-backed gun violence studies.",1359001881

We got a commuter rail train in 2002 for the olympics, which was pretty much limited to a small area in downtown Salt Lake, and then a straight line down through sandy. Then a few years ago we got Front Runner, which is a somewhat fast commuter train between Ogden and salt lake, but which costs somewhere around $250/month last time I checked.<p>Buses are OK, about as good of a system as you would expect buses to be, but if you are looking to go from where I live to salt lake you are probably looking at an hour to an hour and a half, which seems pretty good when you consider that it takes 45 minutes - 60 minutes on Front Runner (30 miles).",1359001642

We do not have to use some bullshit mechanical assumption that ignores the simple fact that humans can do a pretty good job of guessing what other humans intend. You cannot tell me with a straight face that just because AT&T's security was trivial to get around that a reasonable person would conclude that AT&T had intended to grant open access to their member's e-mail addresses.""<p>I think you are getting into the weeds here talking about legal standards.  Do you know what the standard is when a party mistakingly discloses something (leaves confidential info on a park bench, or throws it out with the trash, or publishes it on a public website)?  Do you know what the duties and obligations are of a person that discovers such a mistake?  This is the area of established law that should be applied in this case.  The ""unlocked door"" analogy is rediculous.  Accidentally publishing something via a public URL is the equivalent of accidently publishing something in the newspaper, and equally negligent.<p>In other words, I belive that you are wrong.  Any reasonable and computer literate person will assume that if information is available via a public URL without authentication it is intended for public consumption.  If this were not the case, then it would fall on every internet user to iterpret the intent of the publisher based on the contents of the accessed document, which is largely impossible without first obtaining access in the first place!<p>2) ""Actions taken in a given frame of mind are criminal. The same action could be criminal or not depending on the intent.""<p>There is a certain class of action for which this is true: actions that are expressly prohibited when undertaken with mens rea.  Not all criminal acts require mens rea (drunk driving), and certainly not all actions can be treated as criminal even if there is some kind of ill intent (ridicule of a public figure, stealing someone's girlfreind).  You are making very broad assertions about how the law works and they are not fully correct.<p>With regards to the matter of the CFAA and ""exceeding authorization"", in order to assert that what weev did was criminal you have to establish that the underlying action is illegal when undertaken with mens rea, not just that there was some ill intent.  The underlying action of accessing a public URL is not criminal, as the world wide web is inherrently a public medium, with very well-established means to make content private (authentication, firewall restriction), none of which were employed here.<p>3) ""All law is based on analogical reasoning. Analogies allow us to illustrate operative principles to help translate from familiar situations to unfamiliar ones.""<p>You missed my point.  I have no objection to using analogy to illustrate a point.  What I am saying is that you find it impossible to describe what weev did as criminal without resorting to analogy, and that you entirely rely in the correctness of your analogies to support your assertions.  If you had to make your argument without analogy, you would be unable.",1359001559

I wanted a larger test pool than the two or three of my friends who were online at any given time allowed.<p>So I made my post, and received almost entirely negative feedback from it.

For example if you have a clean record for 10 years after serving your time, you get your voting and firearm privileges back, but a judge or parole board can deny the latter at their discretion if your crime involved illegal or grossly irresponsible use of firearms.  My thinking is that there should be paths for redemption and rehabilitation for all but perhaps the most violent, most serial or most insane criminals, because while crime needs to be punished, if a criminal's life is ruined by the consequences of his/her first crime, he/she has no incentive to even try to become a productive member of society if it's impossible.",1359000472

Let's be honest - in some cases it can be quite fun to do. The underlying problem is the ego, and the corresponding lack of objectivity that results.<p>From reading someone else's code - even glancing at it in some cases - one can infer a great many things. For example, if the indentation on some code is totally borked, most programmers will immediately be extremely doubtful about whether that code contains any interesting or useful ideas (though of course this is not always the case, counterexample being intentionally obfuscated code). In some cases, they will simply refuse to continue attempting to understand the code and dismiss it as useless. A similar thing can happen at the semantic level when the programmer detects a mismatch between the language/framework being used and the problem space; this dissonance is likely what is irking all of the people who are so childishly ridiculing your replace utility.<p>Sometimes when you're looking over someone else's code you spot some perceived inconsistencies/flaws/bugs. The crucially important part is <i>what you do next</i>. If you choose the route of publicly shaming them to stroke your own ego, then you have not only hurt yourself by appearing childish, insecure and unsociable, but you have also hurt their feelings. It's important to remain objective in these situations, and take the self out of the equation. If you HAVE to indulge yourself by tearing the code apart in a humorous manner then at least keep it between with your friends!<p>As I alluded before, I would guess that the reason people where poking fun at it was probably because there exist a lot of other utilities which have the same functionality and are readily available on most any system. Personally, I thought your code was interesting, and I thank you for choosing to make it public :).",1359000110

To use maven, you really need to run your own repository server, and that comes with huge overheads.

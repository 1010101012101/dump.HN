271369,comment,271226,271226,0,0,bullseye,,,"Being a programmer isn't necessarily a prerequisite for starting a tech company.  Thoroughly understanding the technology you are pitching is though.  If you don't have the technological knowledge base to do this, your chances of getting funding on your own are probably not very good.<p>Assuming you have a solid grasp of the technologies you wish to work with, and just not the implementation skills, you might try to develop a design of the concept first.  This is as important for you as it is to anyone else.<p>Do you have the funds to hire a contractor to put together a small proof of concept?  Or even complete the product?  If you are looking for capital for marketing purposes, a finished product may go a long way to helping your cause.<p>Take everything I said with a grain of salt.  I've been in front of investors a few times, but I am not a VC, so their opinions may differ.",1218254159

There is a lot of value in networking that shouldn't just be limited to those selected for ycombinator. We're a niche community and it stands to reason that we can all help each other.

Usually this first course is either real analysis or abstract algebra, and since all analysis and algebra classes tend to build on the fundamentals of these courses, this may show up in the subsequent classes that you take within these fields.",1218252881

It would still leave open an option for the following to happen,<p>A farmer after a poor harvest faces the prospect of starving to death, goes to a local landlord for money in exchange for which he becomes a bonded labourer for life. The next season he tries to run away. But the government, which operates under principle A, catches him and forces him to return to slavery.
I am uncomfortable with the government actually doing this and this is why i reject A.<p>There is an argument made in the context of minimum wage that it actually hurts the people whose work value is less than the minimum wage as employers wont hire them anymore. I am not arguing for or against minimum wage, but want to point out a counterargument which might work in the example given above.
When the landlord knows that if one person refuses slave labor in exchange for money, he can hire some else. But with a law forbidding such contracts in place, the landlord doesn't have this option. In effect, the law enhances the bargaining power of the labourer by restricting his options.<p>In effect, this is the same as the as argument pointed out in the thread above of there being a Prisoner's Dilemma.",1218251394

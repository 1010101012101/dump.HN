You already know what you like, you just need to start working yourself in something big.<p>Listen to music you like, read the books you enjoy, talk to people.\nThere are plenty of projects you can get involved. Start using Debian. Go to a new restaurant. Eat something new. Go and walk in a new park. Count the stars. Start contributing at Wikipedia. Meditate, Kriya Yoga. Smile more. Greet everyone. Buy a present for someone you like (a flower to your mother). Write a real letter. Just do.<p>People too smart and not so intuitive, tend to use the mind more then they should. You, of course, need to use your mind but you also need to use your intuitive felling (some call just &quot;heart&quot;).<p>When you start to go to the right path, you will feel that. No one can say to you, only you can sense.<p>This is just what I think and what I do.",1372935574

I did Aerospace Engineering in Milan, and it was all books and nothing else (I started supplementing my studies with high powered model rocketry just to keep me interested in the courses, it didn&#x27;t last long).<p>If you&#x27;re passionate about a profession, that you know you have talent in it, then use it. A degree is just a piece of paper showing that you&#x27;ve gone through the usual path that says &quot;you know the subject&quot;. What most companies look for is what&#x27;s in your portfolio. What kind of projects do you help out on github? Do you make your own programs, just to make them and see what you can do?<p>I&#x27;ve heard stories of some game developers that literally did a game a week and posted them on their own site. Sure the games were crappy most of the time, but it showed how that person advanced in their knowledge in game development and design. And if that&#x27;s not your thing, grab an Arduino and start messing around with it, make some projects (like an internet or android remotely controlled robot, make a weather station and a website for it, anything like that).<p>Your business card as a programmer is not what courses you finished or how well you did, but how well you know how to apply your knowledge to the real world. These small projects are your calling card.<p>Even if you&#x27;re down in a rut, just look around for inspiration, or just pivot and try something else for a while.

But the important number here is not the multiple, it&#x27;s the Enterprise Value! The multiple is the by-product of the valuation (Enterprise Value/EBITDA = Multiple), and not vice-versa. By using a multiple you are potentially omitting the company&#x27;s future growth, capital structure, increase in profitability/margins, etc. That is why the smart way of valuing a business is via DCF. By using a DCF you are able to critically test if the operational metrics, implied growth, revenues, costs, profitability, etc assumptions are realistic and achievable.

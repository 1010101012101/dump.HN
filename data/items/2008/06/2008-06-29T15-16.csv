231221,comment,230832,230984,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"In Diablo3 it seems they still do not allow players to rotate the camera - I was very impressed by that. Another thing I noticed was how Diablo-a-like every single screen of that game already looks. Improved all over, but still every detail just cries out ""Diablo"".<p>Btw, I guess I won't buy that game. D2 was just too addicting for me. I completely lost half a year on that and I don't want that happen to me ever again.",1214754704

Even if those cars went to infinite efficiency, you'd still benefit more by raising the 10MPGs to a higher number.<p>(No upvote from me though, this is way too obvious!)",1214754596

231217,comment,230877,231095,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"I highly doubt a sovereign wealth fund would invest in Facebook.  Most of their recent equity investments have been in dividend-paying stocks of US banks; they also tend to buy a lot of fixed income assets.  Facebook won't be able to pay dividends any time soon, and while I recall them doing a debt offering, I can't imagine it's on the scale that would appeal to an SWF.",1214754282

231206,comment,230955,231088,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Just as one example, some languages (including English) derive a lot of meaning from a word in where it appears in the sentence (in ""I like smoked salmon"", smoked modifies the salmon, rather than referring to something I may have done), while others conjugate or otherwise modify words (frequently with suffixes) to mark what role they play in the sentence. Most of these sentences have to do with subverting expectations based on word order.",1214753096

Although to make slightly more clear:<p>""If you had had 'had' here"" => ""If you would have put 'had' here""<p>""you would have had"" => ""you would have needed""<p>""to have had 'have' there"" => ""to have put 'have' there""<p>That is the kind of really amusing sentence we say every day without thinking about it. I've caught myself saying similar things while speaking to non-native speakers, and it's always a crapshoot. We really are lazy and use the verb 'to have' a lot.<p>Nice example.",1214752511

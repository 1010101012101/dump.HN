6799249,comment,6789631,6789982,1,0,PeterisP,,,"GUI application code actually is one that often can be very clearly thought as a DFA.<p>In particular, the UI often is non-static and can be in certain states, with the effect of user actions (and possibility of certain actions) depending on that state. If it is implemented or &quot;grown&quot; ad-hoc, it sometimes may turn into a jumble of interdependent code and flag/visibility variables, but very often the exact same behaviour can be modelled and implemented much simpler if you think of it as a DFA.<p>For example, the UI of recently popular single-page webapps, where JS is used to change &#x27;screens&#x27; without page load, or change functionality by hiding/adding large parts of the page, can often be naturally be thought of as DFA, planned (on paper or wireframes) as states=&#x27;screens&#x27; and transitions between them, and then implemented as DFA.<p>Thinking of UI as a DFA also forces you to consider the &#x27;proper&#x27; effect of every user action in every state, which is just good UX practice. For example, in a classic url-based web app you may draw a graph/process of how an user proceeds through making a purchase on your site. Usually it will include only the typical process - but if you think of it as a DFA, you define behavior for actions such as &#x27;requested url /ordervalidation/step2-address&#x27; at <i>every</i> state, since the result likely should be different depending on if the user went there from step1 by clicking &#x27;ok, i want to buy this&#x27;, step3 by clicking the back button, or two weeks later by clicking on a link that he accidentally bookmarked.",1385441990

6799245,comment,6795158,6798937,9,0,cmsmith,,,"Without getting into the general argument here, I&#x27;m just going to dispel a few misconceptions about earthquake engineering:<p>No one (basically) who is involved in earthquake engineering would ever use the term &#x27;earthquake-proof&#x27; to describe one building, much less an entire country&#x27;s construction practices. Instead, we generally design buildings to not require any repair after earthquakes which occur more frequently than once per century, and design buildings not to fall down after earthquakes which occur more frequently than once per 2500 years. There is always a chance that an earthquake will occur outside of those limits, and nothing is designed to withstand those.<p>While you are correct in assuming that adding weight to a structure (all things being equal) will increase the seismic forces it experiences, the contribution of sound insulation to the weight of the building is pretty insignificant. And for lightweight structures it is much easier to increase their strength than to decrease their weight.<p>Third, earthquake resistant &#x27;technology&#x27; [re: design practices] is not as ever-changing as you might think. While there are some examples of innovative solutions like putting water tanks at the top of skyscrapers, for low-rise structures there really isn&#x27;t that much to it. If you take a 100 year old house, screw some plywood sheets between the floors, and bolt it to the foundation, then it will be 90% (estimated) as safe as a brand new house. Earthquake resistance is not so much about technology, and is more about making very sure that all of the force generated in the house can make it to the ground without breaking anything (though physicists would say that the force goes in the other direction from the ground to the structure). This means that earthquake safety is fairly proportional to the amount of time and money spent on construction, which is very much not incentivized by disposable construction.",1385441890

While obviously there&#x27;s a wide range of examples in all countries, certainly modern Japanese housing seems to be of far higher quality and far better finished than &quot;equivalent&quot; modern U.S. housing (U.S. housing from 100 years ago is a completely different thing).<p>It is very true that there is a somewhat different conception of what housing <i>should</i> be like, with Japanese housing being relatively small, compact, and lightweight (though there are those heavy tile roofs on more traditional houses...).  The concept of &quot;insulation&quot; seems to be rather unknown in Japan, which is a real shame given their energy issues (I don&#x27;t know the amount to which home heating contributes to energy usage though).<p>I think it&#x27;s a mistake, though, to conflate all this with with a lack of quality, or to dismiss the cultural differences.  Granted, if <i>you</i>, as a European, are trying to find housing, you&#x27;re going to want what <i>you</i> want, not what the average Japanese wants, but your post does have a whiff of condescension about it (&quot;These poor Japanese, how ignorant they are of our superior European practices!&quot;).<p>[I&#x27;ll note that in my experience living in Japan, it&#x27;s <i>much quieter</i> than urban living in the U.S., despite the higher densities and relative lack of insulation, simply because people take more care to not be obnoxious.  There&#x27;s some noise but it&#x27;s more likely to be quiet conversation on the balcony next door, or children laughing as they play, and not so much douchebag-practicing-his-electric-bass-at-3am.  The urban U.S. is <i>noisy</i>.]<p>I once visited a fairly wealthy Japanese family who had a big, newly built (and very cool) house in the countryside.  It was a fairly cold windy winter&#x27;s day when I visited, but the whole family was sitting in a small room with multiple glass doors to the outside wide open, with the wind blowing in, huddled around a portable electric heater watching TV...<p>I also totally disagree with your dismissal of the kotatsu; it&#x27;s a <i>fantastic</i> invention (right up there with bathtubs you can easily completely immerse yourself in, with a friend), and there&#x27;s very little more cozy and wonderful than snuggling up under a kotatsu on a cold winter&#x27;s evening.... also, cats <i>love</i> kotatsus!! :] [and heating an insulated 0.5m^3 space is a lot more efficient than heating a whole house!]",1385440155

I talk a bit about plans for durability in that overview document.<p>I promise that I have every intention of making InfiniSQL a platform that does not lose data. I have a long career working in environments that demand 100% data integrity. If I de-emphasized it, it was not intentional.<p>PostgreSQL doesn&#x27;t scale for OLTP workloads past a single node. There are a handful of products similar to InfiniSQL (google for the term NewSQL for a survey of them).<p>And yes, a redundant UPS-backed in-memory cache. I have some ideas on how to do regular disk backing as well (which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read).<p>And if a more traditional log-based storage layer is added, InfiniSQL will still scale nearly linearly across nodes horizontally. Multi-node scale and in-memory are not dependent on one another. Though I believe that redundant UPS systems managed by a quorum of administrative agents, and provide durability just like writing to disk.<p>Are you familiar with high end storage arrays, such as from HDS or EMC? They write to redundant memory, battery backed and managed by logic in the arrays. I&#x27;m just moving that type of design to protect the database application itself, up from the block layer.<p>And some people trust their datacenter power--they use pure in-memory databases without UPS already, or they do things like asynchronously write transaction log, which also sacrifices durability. For those groups, InfiniSQL ought to be just fine, without UPS systems.",1385439928

The judge reasoned to that in part with this:<p><i>&quot;First, the Court must determine whether the BTCST investments constitute an investment of money. It is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money. It can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shavers stated, used to pay for individual living expenses. The only limitation of Bitcoin is that it is limited to those places that accept it as currency. However, it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money.&quot;</i><p>The key here is that the judge is trying to understand if the transactions involved met the standard of being an &#x27;investment of money.&#x27; Which he reasons to by establishing that you can convert currency to and from BTC and you can buy products with BTC. He doesn&#x27;t address the question of people who create BTC out of the act of &#x27;mining&#x27; it. Let&#x27;s say Van Gough was alive today, you could use his paintings as &quot;money&quot; in exactly the same way, except Van Gough could make new money just by painting something. Which makes other things more complicated (are bottles of tide &quot;money&quot; if you can trade them for drugs? [2]) It sounds like this ruling simply allowed the SEC to move forward with their case, but I&#x27;ll be interested to watch it to see if it gets appealed (the ruling). Clearly ruling to overly broad here would put the onus on people with collectibles to follow FinCen rules when trading them, which to date they have largely avoided.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/08/06/Bitcoin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/08/06/Bitcoin.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/why-are-criminals-stealing-tide-detergent-and-using-it-for-money/254631/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/why-are-...</a>",1385438896

There are many trojans that go undetected for enough time to do serious damage. I personally know a guy that, even with having anti virus installed, had 2500 BTC stolen from his personal computer.<p>So really, so far the most secure way to store Bitcoin is either to encrypt private key and only then store it somewhere, or print it out, store it in a safe and remove all traces from the computer. Better yet - use a locally hosted javascript app to generate the pair and never write it to disk, from where it could be recovered even after deletion.<p>I'm now working on developing a Bitcoin platform that will enable you to do exactly this - your private keys will be generated on your computer, encrypted with PBKDF2-derived passphrase from your password and only then stored on our servers.

It's not the fact that patentable subject matter has economic properties that warrants protection, it's what those properties happen to be.

Vast swaths of the law can be seen as basically existing to address various economic problems that undermine markets, and the free-rider problem is a common one and propertization is a typical solution.<p>There are economic issues created by laws and regulations (regulatory capture, etc), but they are not the kind of problems amenable to being solved by propertization.",1364842457

Homeopathy (which I'll take as a stand-in for bad science) has nothing to do with folk theory.  Think instead of ""folk theory"" as the informal models we use to interact with the world and to communicate with others about the world.<p>For example, a former employer of mine had problems reported with an internal search facility used by a branch of the customer service team.  A coworker and I shadowed members of this team (ala contextual interview) to learn about their work and workflow.  We were very interested to find that each user of this system had formed their own folk theory about the idiosyncrasies of the (very difficult to use) existing software, theories which let them get their jobs done.  These theories had little to do with the inner workings of the software machine and everything to do with the tasks to be accomplished.<p>As such, creation of folk theory happens automatically in virtually any environment where humans use tools and processes.  Even when this theory is backed by ""science"" or ""inside knowledge"", what emerges is still the working practice, mental models, and language forms of a folk theory.  Back to the article's point then: the idea of invisible interface is problematic because it denies the formation and elevation of culture (folk theory) that will naturally form around an interface.",1364842443

It's a hell of a lot safer than Bitcoin.<p>Castronova, have you ever heard of things like 'margins' or 'fungibility' or 'walking and chewing bubblegum'? You know, people can buy <i>both</i> bitcoins and gold - shocking as this may seem. The question is not 'are people physically on the island of Cyprus who would be buying gold instead buying bitcoins?', the question is 'on the margin, are people worldwide buying bitcoins because of Cyprus?'<p>Nor is pointing out the recent rise an objection. The rise over the past months to $30 was relatively slow and gradual. The rise to $50 and then $105 has been meteoric and directly correlates with the sudden Cyprus crisis. Bitcoin literally started with criticism of bank failures and bailouts (check out the first block, by Nakamoto, in the blockchain) and immunity to this sort of shit is one of its main selling points.

We (thankfully) don't have too many scaling problems on the technical side, but we have a ton of opportunities (product and partner-based) that we could move on much faster with a few more hands on deck, and we're always looking for ways to provide more control to our support team so they can provide top-notch customer service.<p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.<p>We're also looking for a part-time designer/front-end person!

This isn't about wanting something ""over the fence"", it is about wanting the ability to use something that you have in your possession to its fullest. If someone builds you a house for x dollars but but installs some kind of access control to a room so that you can't use it unless you pay an extra 20% of the original price (and you didn't know about this extra room when you ordered the house), would you be happy? The room has been built and the cost of building the room has already been incurred by the builders but they would rather have it empty, wasting space than have you use it unless you pay extra. Would that not frustrate you? If they can afford to build it, without you paying extra, then they are either ripping you or someone else off.<p>><i>...but don't want to do the work to get it.</i><p>Where do you get that from? This isn't about not wanting to pay for extra features, it is about not wanting to own something that you cannot use.<p>><i>I always find this mindset amusing.</i><p>Thanks for that extra piece of information, it really added an arrogance to your post that would have been lost without it.",1364841198

While this may sound silly and academic, <i>net</i> confers a sense of finality -- it includes all costs, marketing, discounts to sell remnant inventory, depreciations... everything.  Learning this distinction will also introduce you to inventory management, promotion cycles, and all sorts of other crazy business skills to help you get to the next level in building a game business.  There are hundreds of years of wisdom built up about manufacturing that all has to funnel through.... accounting...<p>For example, having >50% net profit is fantastic for manufacturing!  Having >50% gross profit is on par for low-scale, specialty products.  Jon's 11.37 is a gross profit and on par.  Knowing nothing about this specific market, the standard advice in this case is to focus on growing the market rather than reducing costs at this point.  (This is a business-model version of the 'don't scale prematurely' mantra you hear in tech considering his price of $20/game doesn't seem insane).<p>Back-of-the-envelope calculations show the gross revenue for all 333 sets is $6,660.  Assuming he's included all costs, this means:<p><pre><code>  Revenue:    $6,660
  Costs:      $4,660
  ==================
  Net Profit: $2,000
</code></pre>
Which means a net profit of $6/set, a little more than 25% of the sale.  Depending on how aggressively he wants the market, he should offer discounts to influential or trend-setting groups of people in the 25% range.<p>Another way to look at this business is he would get a return of $2,000 for $4,660 in capital (since he has 1 production run), or 50% ROI... also not too shabby (if sold at retail price).<p>And yet another way to look at this is manufacturing the product over 8 hours yields $2000, or $250/hour... better than most.  It's unclear how much time he spent on the admin and design tasks, but since this is a labor of love... let's assume it was leisure time and free :)  It also means a second production run may get him an economy scale from re-using the design and website assets for even more $$$/hour.<p>All-in-all, this looks great across the board, and I wish the Jon the best of luck in bringing Space Dice to the world!",1364840696

If this line of reasoning were true then we would never see anyone selling anything that appreciates in value. But this is a very one-sided way to consider this scenario--it only takes into account the supply side. When the asset is appreciating, the demand side takes this into account as well and is willing to discount their asking price to take this into account. You saw this play out with real estate several years ago, and with gold more recently. It may blow out the bid/ask spread a bit, but eventually there will be people who need to sell their asset to buy something else, or there will be people who want the asset badly enough to pay what people are asking.<p>I think this argument can be discounted simply by looking at the current state of things--people are still spending bitcoins even though the recent appreciation dwarfs any built-in deflation.

In the seventh paragraph it says ""O'Reilly is the Bernard-Henri Levy of Route 101"". Do you understand what he means by saying that? Do you know who Bernard-Henri Levy is?  Do you know why the Baffler crowd holds him in contempt?  Can you give a detailed explanation of the disagreements between the New Philosophers and the post-structuralists?  Most Baffler readers can answer these questions, and it is assumed that someone reading the article could fully answer what ""O'Reilly is the Bernard-Henri Levy of Route 101"" means.  If you don't understand that, you won't understand the article, and can not dismiss it other than to say you don't understand it.<p>As far as verbosity - Noam Chomsky often says if you repeat popular propaganda bromides, you can just stop there.

Bitcoin is <i>not</i> a hash function, nor is Bitcoin a digital signature system.  Bitcoin is a digital cash system, and so any discussion of Bitcoin's security must be based on the notion of security in a digital cash system.<p>There are two minimum security properties a digital cash system should have (informally):  first, that the units of value cannot be counterfeited; second, that each unit of value can be spend by exactly one party at any given time.  In both cases, it is commonly assumed that the attacker's work is bounded by some polynomial in the parameters of the system itself, so the system is secure if <i>no</i> polynomial time algorithm can break either property (but an exponential time algorithm might e.g. a brute-force approach).  It is possible (and usually desirable) to prove that a system is secure using mathematical arguments, for example these systems:<p><a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11889663_20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11889663_20</a><p><a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5689448"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=568944...</a><p><a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/5326/5550332/05443458.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/5326/5550332/05443458.pdf</a><p>(Sorry that these are paywalled, you can probably find them elsewhere)<p>Unfortunately for Bitcoin, while it <i>seems</i> to satisfy the first property (but no security proof is out there as far as I know), it fails the second property.  Double spending in Bitcoin requires work that scales <i>linearly</i> with the parameters of the system (the ""51% attack""), which is basically worthless as far as cryptography is concerned.  The fact that Bitcoin uses a secure hash function and a secure signature system is <i>irrelevant</i> because the problem is with the protocol itself.<p>An easy way to illustrate the difference between <i>using</i> a secure cryptosystem and <i>being</i> a secure cryptosystem is the ""surreptitious forwarding"" problem.  Suppose you receive a message from your boss that was signed with his secret key then encrypted with your public key which said, ""You're fired!""  Now what you might do is to re-encrypt the signed message with another person's key and send that to them; they would now believe that <i>they</i> were being fired.  It is not the encryption system or the signature system that you attacked, it was the fact that composing signing with encryption in that manner does not prevent such forwarding (but there are ways to do that).

Customers drop our SDK into their app (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.), then they can go to our elegant web interface to send push notifications, setup triggered events, segment their audience, create a pass/offer for Passbook, and more.<p>There are over 1 billion app installs with our SDK in it.  Many customers are huge brand name apps you would recognize (10M+ users each).  That's a lot of devices we push data to, and it's a lot of data coming back when devices phone home (analytics data, location data, etc.).  Our engineering targets for push are 100,000 messages sent per second or more.  It's interesting because a lot of our traffic is outbound (us sending things to phones) as well as inbound (phones calling back to us).  It's kind of crazy, we have to make sure we don't DDOS ourselves and our customers.<p>I work on Audience Segmentation.  Customers can slice and dice who they want to send to.  We do a lot of GIS/location indexing, as well as indexing based on the preferences and behavior of mobile users.<p>Our engineering roles are available in Portland or San Francisco, your choice.  We also have a Digital Wallet team in Palo Alto that is going hard at Passbook and other digital wallet tools.<p>If you interested email me at ben (at) urbanairship (dot) com.  It's fun!<p>-Ben<p>Back-end Stack: Java (modular/modern), Protocol Buffers, Kafka, HBase, Hadoop (Mapr), some Cassandra.

No.<p>Smart money will simply shift out of cash in an inflationary environment, and the value will not necessarily be productively invested.<p>An opposing viewpoint more thoroughly articulated:<p><a href=""http://mises.org/daily/4618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/4618</a>",1364839295

With an afternoon of instruction and a few practice sessions, you can hit 1000 yd targets with a normal scoped precision rifle without much difficulty.<p>I gather that it must be more publicity stunt than anything; or perhaps at best a vehicle to a lucrative government R&D contract.  Shooters don't need or want this and those who don't shoot because they think it's too hard won't pay for it (if such a person exists at all).  The government has no possible use for it beyond automated weapons systems which they already operate, but I wouldn't put it past them to pay for additional development just for the hell of it.",1364839272

When a steady state is reached, that's apocalyptic to inflationary money systems since debts all the sudden can never be repaid.<p>Edit: I don't think space colonization matters here. Sure, it may be possible. But Mars is sufficiently far from Earth and the energy cost of transport sufficiently high that a populated Mars would effectively be an entirely separate economy for everything but intangibles. I don't think a Mars colony would permit Earthly exponential growth to continue, even though Martian exponential growth could occur for quite some time.

Second of all, non-Keynesian mainstream economists reach similar conclusions; and in any case, have you actually read the Keynesian economics literature and economic data in enough depth to have reached an intellectual (as opposed to political) conclusion about its validity?<p>Finally, U.S. income in real terms has increased substantially since the 1960s; there is no credible measure of inflation, not even some of the alternate ones, by which U.S. real GDP per capita today is lower than in, say, 1965. What has failed to increase, or even declined somewhat, is real <i>median</i> income; real <i>mean</i> income has not similarly stagnated or declined.

I never took the time to learn about endianness until I had that project to play with and i'm glad I did. Would I like to program like that all the time and implement every new protocol as a bitstring? Hell no. But sometimes you're handed an edge case which is just perfect.<p>A protocol which transmits data that dynamically changes according to the use of the application servers, which is implemented by services using a language which makes it <i>easy</i> to communicate raw memory and not need to parse it, passing a tiny low-latency message over an unreliable transport layer without even a concept of whether messages are ordered properly or not.<p>Forget the common developer. Forget compatibility. Forget usability. Forget reliability. This thing only has one function: <i>tell the frontend proxy i'm alive and how many slots are active or busy</i>. The only thing that matters to the backend server is how fast you can spit out a packet, and to the frontend how many machines are alive. Shit, there might not even be a valid checksum on the udp packet. And you're worried about how much effort it takes to implement this? It probably takes less time to write the code than it does to add the source into your makefiles and make a unit test. The existing function that parses these packets is one small function, which without parsing a string would be one memcpy (or the slightly-less-flexible sscanf as shown by wheels earlier).<p>There is no crime in writing apps in a way that fits their use. Not all apps are the same, and not every ""default"" design decision is appropriate. Sometimes you just do what you're familiar with. In this case the Apache guys used an HTTP query string for a heartbeat packet. I would have used something more akin to a network protocol packet. It doesn't really matter as long as it meets the application's requirements and works.<p>But I still like my way better. :)",1330017801

In 1967, the Fourth Amendment was extended to areas in which a person had the ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" (Katz v. United States). This is well established precedent which, in the worlds of Justice Scalia, ""[Katz] has been around \nfor so long, we're not going to overrule that"". In a recent case, United States v. Antoine Jones, both a right leaning justice (Alito) and a left leaning justice (Sotomayor) expressed strong concerns in favor privacy.<p>The above illustrates that the problem is not with privacy, as you seem to think. Thinkers across the ideological spectrum generally believe people have the right to keep things private in many areas of their lives. The question is to what should this right apply and to what extent. Privacy is not doomed just because it is linked to Roe. It has well founded support in a range of cases.",1330017444

Reading this now, it's clear that what I was doing was protecting myself from failure. When I'd do badly on a test in a class that I thought I should do well in, I'd stop taking the class seriously so that when I got a 'C' I could kid myself and say ""I did that and wasn't even really trying""<p>Oddly enough, I never made much of the fact that if I really wanted to do well in a class (because I was in love with the subject teacher for example ... :D) I could actually put the work in to get to the top of the class ... I just put it down to being smart.<p>This had a lot of bad repercussions when I went to college. For the first time in my life I was not only competing with a shitton of people just as smart as me, but almost as many people who were WAAAAAY smarter. Trying really really hard to only make B's was a huge blow to my psyche and I was very demoralized and uninspired for a long time. It wasn't until I realized that not only did it take hard work, but for me, inspiration or passion was necessary to truly excel at something. That's when I realized that I just had to shun things I really wasn't interested in and devote myself to things that I really wanted to be good at.<p>Even nowadays, I still look at people in this field who I consider quasi geniuses (DHH, Yehuda, Resig) and wonder if I can ever get to that level, and whenever I doubt myself, I go back and read this very deeply inspiring article from John Nunemaker <a href=""http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2010/01/12/i-have-no-talent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2010/01/12/i-have-no-tale...</a>",1330017085

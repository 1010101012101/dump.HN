490070,comment,489731,489731,0,0,unalone,,,"Cory Doctorow irritates me. Possibly it's because his name is thrown out as a big name when the only real thing he's done is launch a popular blog - and not a particularly good blog at that, considering most of his work involves just aggregating submissions. Possibly it's because he's a terrible, imprecise writer who finagled his way into a Nebula nomination on fame alone, who goes about making proclamations about the state of literature without ever seeming to have the faintest idea of what literature is about.<p>His opinion on newspapers is correct, though blatant and obvious. Unstated, however, is the need for publications that <i>aren't</i> reliant on advertising, papers like the Atlantic and the New Yorker. These papers won't be going away. The New Yorker is more popular now than ever before, and it's likely to continue that way. If anything, we'll see new methods of aggregation that allow for much more copious doses of quality publishing, which will increase the magazine industry's potential. (That's a goal of the site I'm working on now, so it's a subject near to my heart.)<p>The discussion of movies is a mixed bag. The thing that will cease the production of big-budget movies is the decreasing cost of special effects and powerful cameras, combined with the new-media concept of celebrity that lets most anybody become a star. Talentless celebrities will fade away. The really powerful actors, however, will still command top bill. So perhaps a big movie goes down to a hundred million dollars or fifty million, because things are cheaper and the top price for actors lowers slightly. That won't remove the need we have for big cinema.<p>Doctorow ignores and always <i>has</i> ignored the inability of piracy and open media to impact <i>physical</i> media. Look at Broadway, which has suffered very little from new media. Look at opera. Movie theaters are a rank below in terms of being special locales, but if anything we'll see a shift towards larger and grander - but fewer - theaters. Larger-than-ever movies will be displayed there; the movies that aren't positively enormous will find other distribution methods.<p>This quote in particular irked me:<p><i>Which isn't to say that no one will make these things henceforth -- give it a decade or two and there may well be rich weirdos who fund these productions the same way there are lovely old codgers who can be coaxed into putting up the dough to mount 15-hour, all-singing, all-dancing Wagner operas. Not a mass medium, nowhere near as culturally relevant as BBMs are today, but still a going concern as a vanity/prestige form.</i><p>Excuse the language, but going to attend Wagner isn't a fucking <i>vanity.</i> Wagner wrote incredibly powerful, demanding music, that requires performers who are all virtuoso in every way. Doctorow very obviously has never attended opera before, because opera is one of the sheer most powerful things you will ever see in your life. The people who attend it don't do it for vanity, they do it because opera offers an experience beyond anything else you will see in your life. Similarly, the power of, say, an IMAX screen, offers a moviegoing experience you will never see anywhere else, and so the power of cinema isn't going to up and vanish.<p>With music Doctorow makes some good points. I doubt talentless bands will disappear, because people genuinely enjoy listening to Nickelback (for instance), but this is his area of expertise and he's correct in a lot of ways.<p>Books: Doctorow is wrong about e-book readers. They're going to be huge among the small part of the population that enjoys reading. He's wrong about books shifting entirely to poetry: if anything, that's the best <i>disproof</i> for what he's saying. My friends read poetry. The love of poetry occurs when people learn to love and appreciate language, and Billy Collins has done an incredible job of spreading awareness of poetic appreciation to youth. Poetry <i>and</i> prose is selling incredibly well. (Has nobody noticed that despite these claims of the book as a dying form, sales of books in every genre have gone <i>up</i>?)<p>Doctorow refers to literature as ""culturally relevant"", which - excuse the language - is bullshit as well. Guess how many people read <i>Ulysses</i> when it was published, or <i>Moby Dick</i>, or <i>The Great Gatsby</i>? These are all hailed as masterpieces not because the <i>culture</i> picked them up, but because people with <i>taste</i> fell in love with them, and because those are the people who get followed as time goes on.<p>That's the clincher. Doctorow makes these assumptions that quality and appreciation rely on the masses, and they don't. They never will. Appreciation stems <i>entirely</i> from the power of the piece being made. Most people will never watch <i>Citizen Kane</i>, or even <i>2001</i>. They won't read <i>King Lear</i> or <i>Dune</i> unless they're forced to. The people who <i>do</i> read them won't do it to look sophisticated. They'll do it because they're in love with cinema, in love with reading, in a way that most people never will be. A rare few of those people will go on to make something just as powerful and moving, and things will pick up and continue. That's what keeps these so-called passed-over mediums afloat: not mass, not relevance, but quality. It's why opera will never die, why playwriting will never die, why there will always be novelists who care more about the quality of their work than they care about how many people will read their work.<p>A final thought on the state of the novel:<p>When <i>Moby Dick</i> was published people called it the end of the novel. When <i>Ulysses</i> was published people said the same, and again after the <i>same writer</i> published <i>Finnegans Wake.</i> They said it after every novel <i>Beckett</i> wrote, and they said the short story was dead after Borges became known in America. They said it after <i>Gravity's Rainbow.</i> They said it after <i>House of Leaves</i>, which was published in 2000 and is one of the greatest pieces of literature I've ever had the joy of reading. They say it after every writer, even the lesser ones like Steven King and J. K. Rowling, who offer something to literature nonetheless. The novel is still going strong.<p>So: can somebody explain to me why Cory Doctorow has the following he does? I've never seen him say anything remotely unique or interesting. He just seems to get noticed because he has such a large blog readership, which makes noticing him make about as much sense as turning to Michael Arrington for writings about cutting-edge technology.",1235249892

490061,comment,489827,490042,0,0,frig,,,"Eh, don't read more into an argument than is really called for.<p>The crux of the above argument is usually something like:<p>In most nontrivial programs you'll wind up with a lot of ""sophisticated"" code that performs some task but has a ton of parameters and behaviors it'd be at least theoretically useful to be able to tune or override at some specific point-of-use of said code.<p>Sometimes the right decision is to just hard-code in all the non-essential parameters to sensible defaults, and do only what you need; in places where this approach is warranted (""keep it simple, and only do what you need to""), Java is as annoying to use as ever but doesn't do much to shoot you in the foot beyond being more verbose than it needs to be.<p>It's also sometimes the case that the right decision is to make the code as fully-articulated-as-possible: as many parameters as possible are tunable, and as many behaviors as possible can be overridden. We'll call this the ""complicated"" scenario.<p>In the ""complicated"" scenario, you have at least the following choices for architecture:<p>- approach 1: a tower of interfaces and base classes; each interface+base class combination augments or extends some of the behavior or adds or removes points-of-articulation from the layer beneath it. Once you've built the tower, whenever you get to a point where you need to call on this functionality you pick the appropriate item from the tower, subclass+augment its behavior further (if necessary), and go to town.<p>- approach 2: similar to 1, but make heavy use of reflection (at least at certain points) to try and achieve some level of genericity (in the core methods and algorithms) and to make the implementation less dependent (at time of coding) on the specifics of any particular interface implementation.<p>- approach 3: have methods that're like void openConnection(IConnectionSpecification connectionSpecification, Map<String,Object> options), and then be smart about how you extract options from the options Map.<p>approach 1 and approach 2 have their problems but fit well into the tools Java gives you. Approach 1 is more suited for writing code that other people will use (ie, call into), whereas approach 2 is more suited for writing code that other people's code will be used in (ie, called) (yes, that's a bit vague, but it's good enough for today).<p>Approach 3 is common in the scripting languages, because it allows for a lot of ad-hoc extension / parameter setting without excessively cluttering the interface.<p>Approach 3 isn't impossible in Java, but the lack of literal syntax for eg maps and lists makes it unwieldy. If it were possible to write something like:<p>- ConnectionBroker.openConnection(cSpec, {""port"":80,""username"":""username"",""password"":""password""});<p>you'd see a lot more use of Approach 3 in Java. As-is, you'd have to explicitly construct a Map of the right type, then one-item-and-line-at-a-time populate it with keys and values, and so on, at which point (especially if used often and in a big project) you're better off coding up an IConnnectionOptions interface, etc., and going from there.<p>So it's less: lack of data structures == bad design.<p>It's more: lack of literal syntax for the basic data structures means that it's a royal pain to do certain ad-hoc friendly tasks in an ad-hoc way. Assuming laziness (always a good assumption), given an idiomatic way to handle cases with lots of potential parameters most programmers would handle things the ad-hoc way, and save the ""over-engineered"" tower-of-interfaces for the situations which are actually necessary (eg: real-honest-enterprisey-software).",1235249497

I often wonder what the hell it's doing for those 10-30 seconds. (depending on the motherboard) EFI in Macs is definitely snappier, at least until you start booting into Linux or Windows and the BIOS emulation kicks in and waits around for a couple seconds.<p>Interestingly, you used to be able to get a decent speedup with hibernating (suspend to disk) but nowadays, with the bootup improvements and larger amounts of RAM (my workstation has 8GB; 4GB is pretty normal these days) it only helps if you've got lots of stuff open in your session.

490050,comment,489827,489972,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"My commiserations. Sounds really horrible. But I still think it's more a matter of ""enterprise"" culture than of Java's deficiencies, even though I agree that Java's lack of expressiveness does contribute to these problems.<p>However, it's not unimaginable that a posting like yours could be submitted here 7 years down the road with Java replaced by Ruby/Rails or Python/Django. Piling on libraries is widespread in other communities as well. Attempting to avoid any knowledge of the DBMS even counts as cool in Ruby/Python circles.<p>At least many Java libraries are reasonably high quality. The same cannot be said about something like Django's ORM for example. I looked at the code the other day. They have no optimistic locking, and there is one completely useless existence check before each and every update. It's completely beyond me how anyone could use an ORM that doesn't support optimistic locking. But nobody seems to care. There are even postings in the archives with people claiming it's not necessary for web apps. That's just plain incompetence.<p>The whole idea of abolishing the separation between the database and the application is a huge disaster in the making. Up until now we could at least throw away legacy applications and still have a reasonably well designed database schema. Not any longer. In my view, that's the main contribution of Rails and it's rip-offs to software design.<p>So basically what I'm saying is that incompetence is is widespread and coolness trumps competence for extended periods of time, leaving behind a whole lot of crap like that one you're working with right now. The next generation of crap is piled on as we speak and it's written in today's fashion languages.<p>I'm all in favor of better programming languages because they improve the productivity of good programmers.

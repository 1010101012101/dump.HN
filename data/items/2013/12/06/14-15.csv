It was basically a jab at how terrible the Windows 8 UI overhaul was, rather than a boast about how great the Mac UI is.<p>EDIT: Incidentally, the Windows 8 UI overhaul <i>was</i> terrible. <i>Really terrible</i>. I mean, that does need to be pointed out. Apple got a lot of stick for some slight changes to the way their icons appear on the newer version of the iPhone (forgive me, I&#x27;m not an Apple user so I can&#x27;t comment, I just know the word &#x27;skeumorphism&#x27; was thrown around with various levels of anger), but Microsoft seemed to get a much quieter and meeker acceptance of their terrible UI overhual. Yes, there were articles at the time saying &quot;what is Microsoft thinking?&quot;, but it seemed -- at least to me -- to just be wearily accepted that Microsoft had dramatically changed their UI so that it was unusable for anyone coming from a previous version of their OS.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure why there wasn&#x27;t more consumer outrage about Windows 8. Every Windows 8 user I speak to hates its UI, but they just seem to hate it and get on with it. Maybe it&#x27;s because Windows users are generally less excited by their OS than Mac users? I&#x27;ve never really known a Windows user to speak at any great length, positively or negatively, about their OS.",1386341691

6861289,comment,6856851,6861026,3,0,scott_s,,,"First, you sometimes <i>do</i> want to call exit deep within a program. That is the situation I am addressing, not normal operation. Of course you want to always free unused memory and prevent memory leaks. I am quite familiar with the importance of memory hygiene, and have even written documents admonishing students to use valgrind before coming to me for help: <a href=\"http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs3214/fall2010/projects/esh3-debugging.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs3214/fall2010/projects/esh3-debu...</a><p>Second, please re-read my last sentence. I specifically addressed things that the kernel does <i>not</i> reclaim. This would also include System V shared memory segments and the like. You must manage these yourself, and it is always messy. Typically, rather than calling exit directly, you&#x27;re going to invoke a routine that knows about all such resources, frees them, then calls exit. But you still don&#x27;t need to unwind your stack back to main.<p>Third, the kernel always gets back all of its memory that was granted through conventional means. That&#x27;s what operating systems <i>do</i>. I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what malloc is, and where it lives. Malloc is a user-level routine that lives inside of your process. When you call malloc, it is granting you memory <i>that you already own</i>. Malloc is just a convenience routine that sits between you and the operating system. When you say malloc(4), it does not go off and request 4 bytes from the operating system. It looks into large chunks of memory the operating system granted to it, and gives you some, updating its data structures along the way. If all of its chunks of memory are currently allocated, then it will go ask the operating system for memory - on a Unix machine, typically through a call to brk to mmap. But when it calls brk or mmap, it will request a large amount of memory, say a few megabytes. Then, from that large chunk, it will carve out 4 bytes for you to use.<p>(This is why off-by-one errors are so pernicious in C: the chances are very good that you actually do own that memory, so the kernel will happily allow you to access the value.)<p>Now, even if you are a good citizen and return all memory to malloc, the operating system still has to reclaim tons of memory from you. Which memory? Well, your stacks and such, but also all of that memory that malloc still controls. When you free memory back to malloc, malloc is very unlikely to then give it back to the operating system. So all programs, at exit, will have memory that they own that the kernel will need to reclaim.",1386341520
6861288,comment,6859767,6859968,7,0,sophacles,,,"Some things just aren&#x27;t relationally shaped. You can model them relationally, but it can be a pain.<p>For instance, graphs are totally doable with a traditional rdbms, however it is painful. You end up joining a table against itself (or via an edges table) multiple times, or alternately bouncing many queries off the table as you iterate the graph. One common type of NoSQL db is the graph database that is designed with graphs in mind and you don&#x27;t even have to think about this access. It is nice.<p>Another case that you can do with traditional RDBMS but is annoying is loose user defined fields, such as &quot;tags&quot; where you have to create a tags table and a join table to make it work, with a lot of potential inefficiency there (even with indexes). Or even worse, when you have user defined attributes - lots of custom table creation per user, or big joins against a star topology to do it properly. (Or if not, you end up with something that looks like an sql database to a bunch of frontend code).<p>Of course other times you&#x27;ll find yourself doing something in a NoSQL database that is effectively doing a bunch lookups against a table then combining a result (at which point switching to RDBMS is the solution)...<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that lately the data store is being looked at as a component more like a library than a subsystem. I&#x27;m not sure if this is good or bad, but it certainly has helped a few cases I&#x27;ve dealt with nicely - ripping out a horribly complex data layer and replacing it with a NoSQL solution where the data model is shaped like my data.<p>Basically it&#x27;s a matter of the right tool for the job.",1386341517

They do this slowly, over a period of time, hoping that no one will notice. Only once they are satisfied with their position do they announce their &quot;pump&quot;. They broadcast the idea of &quot;pumping&quot; that coin by a massive coordinated buy. The masses intend to buy in, bidding up the price and then selling off at the higher price.<p>The problem is that the people coordinating the pump already have their coins. And so as the people they recruited are buying, they&#x27;re buying coins from the coordinators. When that activity starts to taper off, the coordinators will dump whatever they have left, completely trashing the price, often below the starting point. So the coordinators are the only ones who benefit at all.<p>There&#x27;s various tricks they also use to make it more convincing, with bid walls and talk of &quot;noob traps&quot;, but at this point it&#x27;s happened so often that willing dupes are getting hard to find.<p>Most pumps these days barely move the price at all. Fontas is so infamous that his pump announcements often result in the price immediately going <i>down</i>.<p>Almost all this activity is on one exchange, BTC-E, which is the only exchange with a variety of alt-coins and the volume for a pump n dump.  There have been attempts to get them going on Cryptsy, with its much wider variety of alts, but that site is so awfully coded that it runs too slowly to allow for any sort of coordinated activity.<p>There have been rumors that there are less public groups running pump and dumps on BTC, which would require substantially more money at this point.  There&#x27;s also clear signs of &quot;dump and pumps&quot; on BTC, where someone will sell a large amount of BTC in hopes of causing a price avalanche, and then they will buy in at the resulting cheaper price.<p>Given the amount of money to be made, those are almost certainly true rumors.<p>Having said all that, I think some of the smaller pumpers on Twitter are just looking to drive the price up on certain coins, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re necessarily looking to take advantage of their followers.",1386341155

I don&#x27;t want to speak for all Chinese, but from what I&#x27;ve read -- please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong -- is that there is more of a culture of deference to authority in China. Compare this to Americans, who have a history and pride in rebelling against authority. Now, you might point to China&#x27;s communist revolution, but realize that with this government came the need for them to propagandize and popularize a love and respect for the government in control, much more so than in the U.S. So back to my original point, protest culture isn&#x27;t as much of a thing there as it is here, because there&#x27;s more of a sense of working for the collective good (economic growth of China).<p>So I&#x27;m hoping that there will by outcry, but I think it is unfortunately less likely than it would be in the U.S. due to Chinese culture.

The moment it hits disk, performance is terrible.<p>This is an over-simplification for any mature database unless all you care about are massive, completely random read workloads[1]. RAM will obviously be faster but there&#x27;s a difference between terrible and performing at the level of the underlying disk subsystem. With a decent system, commits per second should track the underlying storage array&#x27;s IOPS, large read / write traffic should be capable of approaching disk bandwidth, etc.<p>Where things do get bad is when the database is doing more random I/O than required by the workload – if storage is fragmented, it&#x27;s playing sim-MySQL and creating lots of temporary tables, etc. you will see performance which is pathologically worse.

6861210,comment,6860987,6860987,12,0,DanielStraight,,,"So this is very interesting. It&#x27;s not exactly a strength estimator (note that Microsoft isn&#x27;t calling it one, Bruce Schneier is) because it doesn&#x27;t really retroactively evaluate the whole password. For example, &quot;Entrolax&quot; passes the test even though it&#x27;s the name of a drug and therefore likely in dictionaries used for attacks. It passes though because the letter sequence is sufficiently strange. Similarly, the relatively unobscure &quot;omnipresent&quot; gets 4 checks for the same reason.<p>This also seems to discourage passphrases because even though any good passphrase (such as &quot;correct horse battery staple&quot;) will get 5 checks easily, you have to get through a lot of Xs to get to those checks, each one suggesting that what you are doing isn&#x27;t a good idea.<p>The tool does however suggest an interesting alternative to passphrases: Only use as many letters of each word as are unpredictable. In other words, only type each word until the next letter is predictable. For &quot;correct horse battery staple&quot; this gives &quot;c h bat stap&quot;. I really have no idea if this is a good password, but it does get 12 out of 12 checks and only one less check than the full phrase.<p>As with any password evaluation, there are patterns it doesn&#x27;t know how to check. It takes a long time to figure out the pattern &quot;a1 b2 c3 d4 e5&quot; and still gives a check for each space. It doesn&#x27;t detect spiral patterns on the keyboard at all (&quot;gtrfvbnhy&quot; on a qwerty keyboard for example).<p>Still, it will be interesting to see what they can do when they get more data and think through some of these issues.<p><i>EDIT</i><p>You can also use this to choose letters that make sense but aren&#x27;t in the prediction. I came up with the password &quot;pitabakes&quot; (pita bakes), which is obviously pretty easy to remember and presumably fairly weak simply by deliberating taking something which seemed likely but not in the top 3.<p>One also has to wonder whether deliberately being unpredictable somehow becomes predictable. This tool, to some extent, suffers from the fundamental mistake of gamblers: seeing patterns where there aren&#x27;t any. See jerf&#x27;s post about getting X marks in a LastPass-generated password. If you tweak your random passwords to not be predicted by this engine, are you actually making them somehow more predictable?<p><i>EDIT AGAIN WITH MORE NEW FINDINGS</i><p>You can also get high numbers of checks (and a relatively high ratio of checks to X marks) using common dictionary words if you switch words in the middle. So, taking the words &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;pasta&quot; and &quot;toffee&quot;, using &quot;grapastoffee&quot; which gets a 50/50 ratio of checks to X marks (6 of each). This actually seems like a pretty good way to generate hard to guess passwords. &quot;Pen&quot;, &quot;noodle&quot; and &quot;duck&quot; giving &quot;penooduck&quot; does even better, 7 out of 9 checks.",1386340808

The schemaless approach provides faster iterations and the ability to simply express things that require elaborate language features in a static-typed language.  The difference is that in a DB, you have to support the data created by all your previous versions, so a DB requires far more discipline than the application code.<p>I can see the appeal, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth it.",1386340801

The difference is that its wrapped up in the fractional reserve banking system.<p>2. Due to inflation uninformed people are bullied into investing in mutual funds, stocks, housing, etc. with their savings. Just the <i>existence</i> of bitcoin as a major worldwide currency could transform the traditional saving model.

He can avoid speculative bubbles and bad mutual fund managers.<p>3. National currency reserves are currently done with sovereign debt - with the idea being that if a nation goes bankrupt they&#x27;ll just inflate their currency anyway and the currency reserve may as well be in bonds. If Bitcoin were to become a major world currency, the reserves could be in actual Bitcoins.<p>All of this to say I still think that there is a 90+% chance that bitcoin will fail, but on that remaining percent, the limit higher than 100 times today.

While transfer fees accrue to the shareholders of Western Union, the transfer fees of BTC transfers do not accrue to BTC owners. In fact, the transfer fees are quite small to zero and they accrue to the miners.

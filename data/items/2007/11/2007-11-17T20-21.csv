81015,comment,81006,81006,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"At the risk of sounding like an old prude, I'm not crazy about dragging somebody out by name and then everybody gathering around and critiquing his life. Seems a little perverse to me. Perhaps asking about his work, the general lifestyle, or his theories might be a little more fertile ground? Instead of asking opinions about the man himself. I mean really, who the heck really knows Wolfram here? He's just some guy we read about in the media.<p>
Having said that, I'm glad to offer positive feedback about what I know about him. I can certainly admit that I envy his lifestyle of setting up a company and then pursuing science with the resources available. I'm a big fan of NKS and the computational universe. But heck if I can understand it all. I admire it the way I would a great painting -- it's obviously the work of a master, and whether it's expressionist or impressionistic I have no idea. He's a interesting and unusual person. It'd be cool to have a beer with him and discuss The Matrix.",1195332949
81014,comment,80563,80623,0,0,apathy,,,"> They are counting on you...<p>More often than not, they're counting on a risk-taker to try and bring financial stability to the household, as well.  If you are spending so much time away from your family that it's wrecking your family, there's a problem.  But there are plenty of ineffectual workaholics that do the same thing for some overlord's profit.<p>If you're going to sacrifice something as valuable as time with your family, it better be for a good reason.  Chalk up another benefit for making these choices concrete.

81009,comment,80933,80986,0,0,boucher,,,"Also, its worth noting that you can not reclaim the memory of an object in Java, C# (<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/clyon/archive/2004/09/21/232445.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/clyon/archive/2004/09/21/232445.aspx</a>), or any other garbage collected language.  If you could, you would no longer have managed code.  What you may be able to do in some languages is say ""hey GC, I've got this object, I know its got no references, verify that and free the space now please"".  You can't do this in Java (or C# so far as I know).  This is what I meant when I said destroy.  <p>Why might someone need that level of control?  Well in an ideal world you would not, but in reality (at least in Java), GC is highly JVM dependent, and on the JVM I use (and probably most if not all of them) GC makes no guarantee that objects available for collection will actually be collected.  The OS X JVM in particular is pretty bad here (again, I'm guessing others are too), when you run out of memory, it doesn't even try to GC.  Even if you call System.gc() you might not get any space reclaimed.  Its ridiculous, but lots of people actually have a method that is basically ""System.reallyGC()"" which loops a whole bunch of times on System.gc() calls until it either gives up or reclaims some percentage of memory.

81005,comment,80933,81002,0,0,boucher,,,"And I wasn't arguing that the title wasn't misleading. Just that while it may be slightly misleading, the article itself clearly puts it in context.<p>perhaps: ""used to express reluctant or qualified agreement or acceptance.""",1195330481
81004,comment,80951,80996,0,0,boucher,,,"I agree that this particular argument is pretty pointless, and I even believe that there are plenty of examples of people programming with TDD and having great results.  <p>My only problem with the TDD paradigm is that it doesn't work with the way I think about software.  It isn't so much about having a formal correctness proof, but when I'm writing code, its incredibly more valuable to me to think it through, reason about the various inputs and outputs, and convince myself that it is a correct solution.  And although I usually don't, I see the value in writing tests to verify some of the assumptions you made.  I don't, however, see the logic in starting from a set of tests (especially ones that can't possibly know about the specific ""pressure points"" of the code you will eventually write) and then deriving the solution.  But that's just me, and as they say, different strokes...",1195330136

I should, but I need to get my Indonesian and Arabic fix before I can tackle Python and Ruby on Rails and Sugar-Coated Sugar Bombs.<p>That is part of the reason that I love WordPress, the blogging platform this blog runs on.

44760,comment,44509,44704,0,0,kevinl,,,"Just my feeling:)\n1. It's better to run web application with more screen space, not every app need menu bar, toolbar, etc brought by every instance of browser.\n2. For browsing, tab is excellent. For web application, tab is not enough. For example, I can't implement an ""always on top"" thing using  tab, I can't let browser remember every application's location and size. These features are good for productivity.<p>Current browsers are designed for maximum surfing productivity and not dedicated to provide a perfect web application container.",1187701032
44759,comment,44580,44651,0,0,koolmoe,,,"I agree with this.  I also think that the REPL of Lisp, Ruby's irb, and Python's IDLE are very valuable for the new programmer.  I knew a few languages when I hit graduate school, but I ended up doing most of my ""programming"" in Matlab because of the interactive shell.  When I first picked up Python and later Ruby and Lisp, I was delighted by the interactivity.  The instant feedback, even when it's negative, just feels more forgiving than compiler errors, and the whole process of trying things out at a prompt feels more like learning than code/compile/run.",1187700947

Well, the decision was mainly a result of three factors. First, someday I may start my own company, and transitioning from a startup makes that much easier. Second, I didn't agree with many of Microsoft's decisions and direction. Third, I wanted to build a product that would really cater to consumers and could stand on its own.",1187700913

44753,comment,44743,44748,0,0,staunch,,,"There's at least two aspects to learning: depth and pace. Most schools don't let you go much deeper or faster than the class average. An optimal teaching environment would move both of the goal posts ahead of you, so you're never being artificially slowed down. This is exactly why learning by yourself works so well. It's like running by yourself. You can go however far and however fast you want.",1187700064

To better actualize the potential of the top 5% would be a wonderful change.<p>High school kids wouldn't even need the $15K.

44750,comment,44580,44618,0,0,jkush,,,"The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is because the vast majority or books / tutorials available don't teach how you can really use it. Douglas Crockford and a handful of others have been beating the drum about Javascript being a functional language, but I don't think it's at critical mass yet.<p>I think most people starting out with Javascript would learn  how to do stuff in a browser but not how to ""program"".\n",1187699674

That always bothered me.<p>If the class itself had value, attending class would naturally produce, on average, better test scores. If classes don't add value, anyone with sincere interest in the subject could pull more value out of reading books and reading code than sitting through lecture.",1187699391
44748,comment,44743,44747,0,0,drusenko,,,"Value in the case of school meant how well you mastered the course objectives: that's how much value you produce in a class (so I think we agree there). Learning more is preferable to learning less, but it depends on what the opportunity cost is. It's entirely possible that you have learned enough in that area, and time spent learning in a different area would be better invested.",1187699379
44747,comment,44743,44743,0,0,staunch,,,"The objective of school is for students to gain knowledge and grow their minds. It's not to see how much value you can produce. Everyone maxes their brain out at a certain point, the goal is to get everyone maxed out so they have to get smarter. Feynman's teacher gave him a college level book just so in his boredom he wouldn't distract the rest of the class.<p>Most schools suck at handling people who are different than average. Thanks to the internet it's easier than ever to learn by yourself. It's an autodidact revolution!\n",1187698923

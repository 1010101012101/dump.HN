The short version is that you&#x27;re partly right on #2 but probably less than you think, and definitely not on #3.<p>Edit: ok, here you go. Long, but hard to make shorter.<p>Here are all the things that can make a post fall in rank: user flags, software penalties (for voting rings, flamewars, etc.), and moderator downweights. All try to optimize HN for the core value of the site—intellectual curiosity—and all are mechanisms to countervail the upvoting system in some way. Why? Because pure upvoting optimizes for other things than intellectual curiosity, such as outrage, gossip, and gaming the system.<p>Think of HN like a flower garden. The flowers are stories that gratify intellectual curiosity, and to have these we must protect the garden against weeds, rabbits, motor vehicles, and other things that otherwise would soon take over.<p>User flags and software take care of much, but not all, so moderation is needed. (We&#x27;d love to make it not be needed, but that&#x27;s a hard problem.) Our criteria for downweighting come from a general sense of what attracts upvotes for reasons other than intellectual interest. It&#x27;s not about what we personally believe, or have a vested interest in, or even what we happen to be interested in ourselves, with the possible exception of APL.<p>When we downweight, we try to use a light touch. When you see a story plummet off the front page, it probably wasn&#x27;t moderators who did that (or there was a clear-cut reason, such as a duplicate). In judgment call cases, we&#x27;re more likely to make a story go from #1 to #4. It&#x27;s all about balance.<p>You may reply that &quot;a general sense&quot; is hopelessly subjective, and I&#x27;d have to agree, yet it&#x27;s not as subjective as you might think. For example, we wouldn&#x27;t downweight a substantive article about startups just because it disagreed with YC&#x27;s philosophy. We might do so if it included a lot of tricks to stir up controversy. Do you see the difference? The latter is procedural; not much different than editing linkbait out of titles. If you do this job across tens of thousands of stories, and you&#x27;re conscious of the obvious biases, you can mostly guard against them, especially since the same patterns come up over and over.<p>Not sure if I&#x27;ve succeeded here in getting across the gist of what we do, but I hope it helps a bit.<p>As for #3, that&#x27;s an easy one. We don&#x27;t give YC startups extra favor when it comes to boosting stories. If a Stripe API went to #1, that was because the community heavily upvoted it. We also are less likely, not more, to downweight stories when they are critical about a YC startup, such as the thread we&#x27;re currently commenting in.",1450216282

I switched to rc in 2001 because I was unhappy with bash, and wish I had not bothered.<p>If the entire world switched from bash to rc when I did, then my switching to rc would have been a minor improvement, but since of course the rest of the world did not switch, my switching to rc just made me slightly incompatible with the rest of the world, and those incompatibilities more than cancel out the relatively minor advantages of rc relative to bash.<p>For example, file-name completion (the tab key) in shell mode in Emacs has been programmed to use the backslash character to escape, e.g., spaces in file names (and OS X ships with files whose names contain spaces).  But rc does not grok the backslashes: it uses a different convention to quote characters like spaces, and no one as far as I have been able to discover has modified shell mode to use rc&#x27;s convention (and none of fish, zsh, csh, tcsh, etc, share rc&#x27;s convention on quoting).<p>rc is different enough from bash that about a third of the time, I cannot just copy a command line from a web page and paste it into rc without manually editing the command line first.  for example, the two common ways of doing command substitution  in Unix shell command lines are `like this` and $(like this), but rc recognizes neither convention, and I have to change it to be `{like this}. (Being different from the way the rest of the world does things for little or no actual benefit, by the way, is common in software from Plan 9.)<p>More examples at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7614694"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7614694</a>.<p>When I say that rc has only minor advantages over bash, I mean that I still find it almost as annoying to write anything involving a looping or a branching construct in rc as I do in bash. And I still miss not having access to the data structures I have access to in, e.g., Emacs Lisp. And for those data structures, such as the string, that rc and bash do have, I miss the API I have access to Emacs Lisp.<p>I still use rc as my interactive shell (mainly because I do not yet want to rewrite my 570 lines of customizations -- mostly rc functions that wrap commonly used commands like ls and du) but plan to phase out my reliance on rc gradually over the next few years.",1450216042

What aren&#x27;t you understanding? Here is are links to more studies.&quot;<p>Do you see how Alice is failing to address Bob&#x27;s concern or really even acknowledge it?<p>>Coal was cheap but isn&#x27;t really the cheap fuel anymore.<p>That&#x27;s only because natural gas got even cheaper than coal. Both are still cheaper per KwH than renewals without subsidies or externalities calculated in.<p>>Also, in developing areas, it may be cheaper to use distributed renewable than to build out the grid.<p>If they are fine with unstable power, sure.

It simply alerts me in the IDE (I use VSCode which I also love). This is a huge time saver.<p>Another great thing is the intellisense, which allows me to keep on coding without looking at some API documentation or other files in the project. The intellisense even has the documentation in it - so this is a really fun and efficient way to learn new libraries and frameworks.<p>I didn&#x27;t even know how much I missed enums in JavaScript until I started using them in TS.

That is an enormous mortality effect.<p>Based on the mechanism by which statins are postulated to cause diabetes (and LDLR-dependent mechanism), PCSK9 inhibitors may also cause diabetes, though it&#x27;s not yet known. From a mortality perspective, this is irrelevant because we know that statins (and PCSK9 mutations) reduce mortality despite (probably) causing diabetes.<p>The timing of statins falling off patent is essentially uncorrelated with anything - there was a multi-year gap with atorvastatin off patent before the PCSK9 inhibitors were approved, which makes no sense if you would like to invoke a patent conspiracy. With the advent of genetically-informed early phase research, you will continue to see new drugs come out at an increasing frequency (reversing the trend over the past few decades of fewer approvals).<p>The link from cholesterol -> CHD -> mortality is as clear as anything in biology (clear enough for the basis for this work to have won a Nobel prize decades ago).",1450215080

I would argue that even the increasingly common backend vs. frontend separation is a form of MVC. Of course, MVC isn&#x27;t synonymous with <i>MVC frameworks</i>.<p>When it comes to pure old MVC, I feel that it is a bit like Greenspun&#x27;s tenth rule:<p>> Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.<p>So any UI environment will eventually contain an architecture that more or less embodies the spirit of MVC.<p>And I think MVC is fine <i>within a single environment</i>. That means, the information travelling from the models to the controllers to the views does not contain intermediary where mediums are crossed. A traditional Rails application crosses from databases to a Ruby program to a web browser, and each bit of logic is dependent of the others.<p>What makes the backend/frontend separation such a good model is that a front running on a REST API is not inherently dependent on a protocol or a server implementation, and the same applies to the backend. This will work in the post-HTTP world, whenever that comes.<p>Traditional Rails apps assume they are talking to a web browser. This is assumption is no longer tenable.",1450215003

Plus, aluminum oxide is only about half aluminum so another 2, lets call it 1 megajoule per kilogram of aluminum in round numbers.<p>Refining aluminum oxide into aluminum takes 54 megajoules per kilogram of aluminum!

But it was apparent that the setup and maintenance costs were going to be higher than we wanted. And nobody outside of the engineering group would probably be able to figure out how to use the thing (we have a lot of other teams writing code that aren&#x27;t &quot;engineering&quot; teams).<p>Right before I was about to give up, I found Drone: <a href=""http://try.drone.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://try.drone.io/</a> (GitHub: <a href=""https://github.com/drone/drone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/drone/drone</a>)<p>With Drone, builds are done within Docker containers. Cool enough, nothing super special there. The real magic is that all of the plugins (<a href=""http://addons.drone.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://addons.drone.io/</a>) themselves are also ran in Docker containers. So we can write plugins in whatever language we want, they can be pinned to specific tags or auto-upgraded at build time.<p>That and the setup process was basically &quot;run this Docker image, pass in some env vars&quot;. The UI, while still <i>very</i> basic is easy enough for our other teams to use, and the small but growing community is very receptive to feedback and pull requests.<p>Check it out if you aren&#x27;t opposed to a Docker-heavy build system.

I would imagine while their motivations might be similar to what YC wants with HN (distribution, influence), they could possibly open up and serve new members in the ecosystem that aren&#x27;t, can&#x27;t, or don&#x27;t want to be a part of the HN/YC pipeline.<p>Building a working group of heterogenous independent sources to serve new and exciting topics is important to breaking out of the echo chamber we so often create for ourselves within tech. I was hoping Product Hunt could bootstrap the entire venture, stay clean, and true to the spirit of a meritocracy.<p>Then they went through YC, and now I see the same &quot;influencers&quot; there as I do here, with the same system in place to promote their own vested interests. It just makes me slightly sad that the pressures of succeeding create collusion among players in this market, thereby perhaps obscuring the potential for new/interesting/different emergent technologies/startups to thrive.<p>Among my peers, over time PH has become less of a community set out to serve the good of the people, and instead has become more of a pipeline for quick sales or testing new ideas, leaving a feeling of what can only be described previously as the &quot;Tech Crunch of Initiation&quot;.<p>Product Hunt has essentially supplanted Tech Crunch in the YC/TC relationship of yesteryear, albeit to an even more perilous extent. Products are no longer vetted by working professional journalists, whose obligation should be to the consumer and not the producer, but rather by the very product&#x27;s investors, advisors, and &quot;insiders&quot;.<p>We therefore must ask what is the value-add here?

In other words, the chemical processes that power life are a reduction from a complex form to a simpler form and and the generation of heat. For instance, most organisms eat food, digest the food, which breaks down the complex chemicals to simple ones, and generate heat. So, while an organism may evolve into a more complex form, in the environment, it is creating entropy overall.

Again, not exactly ground breaking.  Why do you think central banks generally raise interest rates during times of high inflation?  Today however, we barely even have inflation.  And then another link is pedantic about the definition of &#x27;inflation&#x27;.<p>The &#x27;cure&#x27; for recessions is apparently to let them happen.  This isn&#x27;t a bad thought, however there IS a human cost.  The region I live in Canada right now is going through a recession, what are the symptoms?  Increased crime, increased domestic violence, increased suicide, higher poverty.  And this is a country with a social net.  It wouldn&#x27;t get any better with &#x27;laissez-faire&#x27; policies...<p>Anyhow, while so called &#x27;Keynesians&#x27; are busy actually trying to be economists (both in industry and government), &#x27;Austrian&#x27; economists are basically just whining about how they&#x27;re marginalized, without offering up anything more than empty rhetoric and no answers.<p>And then the best straw-man of all:  &quot;Why did no one predict the housing crisis and subsequent recession?&quot;<p>For the same reason &quot;no one&quot; predicts the crashes of individual stocks.  Because people get caught up in the frenzy, ignore the voice of reason, and the smart money has already exited...  If no one predicted the housing crisis, why did Goldman Sachs bet against it?<p>BTW, Keynes was a fairly successful investor, far more so than Hayek...<p>Speaking of investing, one of my favourite quotes:  &quot;Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs just get slaughtered!&quot;",1450213421

But that&#x27;s a totally different issue. When you compare ten cartons of 1 pint milk vs one carton of 10 pints, then you are dealing with indistinguishable ten cartons.<p>If you want a real world metaphor that&#x27;s like software complexity, you could rather use recipes. Elaborate, complex recipes don&#x27;t scale; just like software. There it&#x27;s not trivial to put the non-indistinguishable ingredients together. With milk, it&#x27;s just pour all the milk in one big container. There is no additional thinking required.<p>TL;DR author compares apples and oranges.",1450213285

My only disagreement would be the idea that if the tradeoff is really that bad, you could quit and your fame would dissipate pretty rapidly relative to other media. Also the idea that being famous is an unalloyed negative;  there are many, many people for whom fame itself is a desired outcome.

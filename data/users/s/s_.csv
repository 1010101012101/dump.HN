Stormbringer,0,1352,1.0,0,633,"True story: today I went down to the local $non_profit and helped out one of the guys get his new Apple laptop hooked up to the network and the network printer. The network worked immediately after entering the WEP password. The printer didn't work first time, so I deleted it and tried with new settings. It worked the second time. I also tried to persuade him of the virtues of buying a 1-2TB drive and using Time Machine.<p>It was so easy it was embarrassing.<p>I contrast that with some work I did with a startup last year. I bought one of their own Windows laptops into their HQ, and trying to get onto their own wireless network was a nightmare, even though I had a room full of techies to help. I strongly suspect that in the end the tech support guy just turned off the wireless router and left it off because it was too much trouble.<p>I'll do Apple support for love (ie free support for friends and family) , but you couldn't pay me enough to do Windows support. I fully appreciate the guys that do take on that thankless task, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone.<p>Does that make me an incoherent raving Mac fanboy? You be the judge. But consider at the same $non_profit I stood and patiently nodded while one of the 70 year old blokes told me about his Windows experiences. At the end I fully commended him (he's running anti-virus, anti-spam and does regular backups) for his efforts, and I assured him that he was doing the right thing with the backups, to keep doing exactly what he is doing. I didn't preach to him about Apple at all, I don't see the need. If he's happy, let him be happy. If he is doing everything right but has some nagging feeling that he should be doing something else, I will reassure him that he's miles ahead of the rest of the pack.",1290656708,1452891611

Our most primary experience is in physical space. Yet our lives today are shaped as much by JavaScript as they are by walls, both of which are in turn shaped by various laws and policies. I see all of these relationships as types of space and our world their indefinable confluence. The control and arrangement of latent possibilities in physical space is what architects call program. Yet I want to program many types of space, many different relationships. This is perhaps the modern designer’s imperative—to consider all types of space in order to effectively address the enormous problems corporations, organizations, cities, and governments face today.\nDesign thinking for me is the capacity to examine problems through a range of lenses, and at a range of scopes per each lens. In addition to nimble intellect, Design demands the measured and methodical introduction of various constraints in the approach towards a solution, done through the skillful control of visual representation of complex relationships. It’s a process that rests on the capacity to observe and understand people in their environments. Design thinking for me is simply thinking. I really can’t do it any other way.",1396031797,1453171024

I shall remain on this mountain.\n I have a favor to ask of you: would you please bury my body as that of a dead monk.&quot;<p>Hyakuj had the director of the monks strike with the gavel and inform everyone that after the midday meal there would be a funeral service for a dead monk.\n The monks wondered at this, saying, &quot;Everyone is in good health; nobody is in the sick ward. What does this mean?&quot;\n After the meal Hyakuj led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain and with his staff poked out the dead body of a fox and performed the ceremony of cremation.\n That evening he ascended the rostrum and told the monks the whole story.\n baku thereupon asked him, &quot;The old man gave the wrong answer and was doomed to be a fox for five hundred rebirths. Now, suppose he had given the right answer, what would have happened then?&quot;\n Hyakuj said, &quot;You come here to me, and I will tell you.&quot;\n baku went up to Hyakuj and boxed his ears.\n Hyakuj clapped his hands with a laugh and exclaimed, &quot;I was thinking that the barbarian had a red beard, but now I see before me the red-bearded barbarian himself.&quot;",1243492108,1452466964

Studied CS in Waterloo undergrad and Business / Entrepreneurship in CMU grad school. Worked at Microsoft (Redmond) and Google (Mountain View) as an engineer. Worked at startups of every stage, and fell in love with building businesses. Coffee junkie. Grew up from nothing (really, not relatively). I feel beyond fortunate to be where I am today, and wouldn&#x27;t believe my journey 10 years ago. Want to give something back to humanity before I die.

He also has discovered that nature's processes can explain the processes of life and the process to succeed at your goals. He is working on book dealing with storms of life.  <p>Now on the profession side of things, I am a Commodity Research and Fund Administrative Associate for JKV Global Enterprises a Institutional Commodities Brokerage firm. My responsibilities include developing relationships with pension funds, hedge funds and high net worth individuals as a teammate with the Vice President of Business Development. In addition, I provide geo-political analysis of global events in relation to the markets, and investigate asset managers on the behalf of pension- institutional investors for potential allocations. During my tenure the firms investable capital increased by over 40%. I developed business development skills from this position that compliment the skills gained from work in the community development world.<p>From my experience within the community development world, I have come to the belief that the community partnerships are at heart of any successful community development plan. My belief developed from experience as a member of ACCION Chicagos turnaround team, I have had the privilege and the honor to play a key role in the survival of many Chicagoland community based companies despite the recent downturns in the economy. This experience came though two- terms as a AmeriCorps<i>VISTA volunteer at ACCION Chicago, which is Non- profit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) that fosters the growth of small enterprises through investing and developing community partnerships.<p>During my first term at ACCION, I was the Social Investment Coordinator with the objective of developing and executing strategic plans to develop community relations with healthcare providers, for- and non- profit community development organizations. In addition to developing a fundraising plan to obtain new investments, raising $1.1 Million in 2002-03 in the form of Grants and other types of structured financial instruments wide- range of donors. During this experience, my work consisted of presenting complex information to a wide- range of audiences with varying backgrounds, which ranged from elementary school students to community development professionals to financial services regulators.<p>After being in the position for ten months my responsibilities evolved into a business development and public relations role called the Assistant to the Executive Officers. While in this position, I spent a majority of my time redefining the image of ACCION Chicago and forming relationships with organizations that are complimentary. This included developing a marketing campaign during the organizations turnaround period focused on promoting ACCION as co-partners in future Fortune 500 companies. This strategy included fostering relationships with various groups that included banks, insurance companies, foundations, Small Business Administration, CDFI Fund, and community stakeholders. During 2004, the plan raised $2.6 million in capital. In addition, I underwrote commercial loans, developed a system of reporting to investors, analyzed distressed and charged-off portfolio investments, and revised the underwriting policy.<p>My educational background consists of a BS in Industrial Technology- Manufacturing Safety Engineering from Southern Illinois University- Carbondale in combination with a MS in Service Management and a MBA in Financial Analysis and Investments from St. Xavier University- Chicago.",1174662642,1174662642

I mostly use Perl, Python, bash and Ant for scripting. I also like cake.",1294946254,1450630776

The platform gives students and anyone with a passion for learning the ability to study at a faster pace,and remember what they learn for much longer. Sharplet courses are organized as ‘facts’ presented in flashcard format. A spaced repetition algorithm optimally schedules fact review times in response to how well users recall each fact. As users progress through the course, facts that are well known appear less frequently than less well known facts. Learning via the spaced repetition method is one of the fastest ways to transition knowledge into long-term memory. With the time users save it is possible to learn even more new information.",1405416005,1452927535

skclouse,0,1,0.0,2,1,"I am a hard working, family loving, freedom fighting entrepreneur who loves to have fun.  I grew up in small town in north eastern Arizona called Snowflake.  I lived with my grandparents on a small farm during my high school years where I learned how to work hard and the importance of just getting things done.  My grandpa, Glen Stratton, always told me that if you see something that needs to be done, dont wait to be asked, just do it.  I dont know if he took this from Nike or if they took it from him but it made a lasting impression on me.  At the age of 20 I served a two year religious mission to Cape Town, South Africa for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have to say without a doubt that serving a mission for a cause much greater then I was one of the best decisions I ever made.  You see, I learned to get out of my own way and put the interest of others before my own.  Isnt that what life is really about?  I almost didnt go; but I am so glad I did.  After my mission I went to college worked for a couple of Inc 500 companies, held ownership in the largest property management company in Arizona and through all of that found my passion as an entrepreneur.<p>I do my best to see the bright side in all situations and to make the most of them.  In fact take a look at this video clip of Aimee Mullinsits very inspiring.<p>I want you to notice how I said that I do my best.  I believe that doing our best is all that is required of us.  Your best in one area of life might be so much more than mine on the same area and vice versa.   We all have been blessed with gifts, talents, and abilities and these are what we need to be focusing on.  As Sterling W. Sill (I was named after himmy first name is Sterling) once said, Hang on the walls of your mind the memory of your successes. Take counsel of your strength, not your weakness. Think of the good jobs you have done. Think of the times when you rose above your average level of performance and carried out an idea or a dream or a desire for which you had deeply longed. Hang these pictures on the walls of your mind and look at them as you travel the roadway of life.<p>The way that I see it, you and I can accomplish more than 5 times together then what we could accomplish alone.  You bring your strengths, I bring mine, and together we can have a synergistic union.",1293826349,1452891993

smallbigfoot,0,1,0.0,0,0,"Started a lawn care business when I was 12 because I was bored and wanted money to buy some Pokemon cards so I knocked on my neighbors doors and soon had 10 clients.  I worked very hard all season long and by the end of the first season I had more than enough money to buy Pokemon cards and quite a bit left over.  So I decided to invest my newly earned money in the stock market.  I started researching what stocks would best meet my objectives and started trading (through a custodian account my parents set up).  I soon was making more money trading than mowing.  I kept both up while adding landscaping to the mix.  At age 22 I sold my landscaping business and started a software startup.  Now I trade stocks a few hours a day and work on my software startup the rest of the day/night.  I also graduated from Columbia College.",1363746680,1453175236

We have a grand vision about our product, but for now the SpokenBits iOS Application allows you to give it any of your favorite articles or blog posts&#x27; URLs (in any language), and it will extract the uncluttered context from it and read it for you. Think of it as mini Audio Book of your favorite articles or blog posts.<p>Why\nWe the founders love reading a good article or blog post, and it was hard to keep up with our always increasing queue of articles. Then we thought &quot;what if I could listen to these articles during my commute ?&quot;. As you can imagine, we are scratching our own itch with the SpokenBits iOS Application, and we&#x27;ve been using and loving it since the very early prototypes. We hope you find it useful too.<p>Who\nSpokenBits was founded by three guys who have been developing software for many years and have worked on multiple companies like: Oracle, Symantec, Rearden Commerce (Deem), Palm, Motorola and BEA Systems to mention a few.",1427241481,1453167479

When I began to think about raising seed capital, there were few alternatives to consider. Thats when I realized that instead of founding a company, founding Baseline would be the best use of my skills and interests. Bringing a diverse experience from eBay, Microsoft, Kleiner Perkins, Starbucks and Digital Equipment Corporation and an avid love for affecting change, Baseline addresses the gap between individual investors and institutional venture capitalists. My purpose is to help founders build and grow their early stage companies into change affecting enterprises.\nSince inception Baseline has invested in more than 60 companies including YC co's OMG Pop, Heroku, Xobni, GoLocal and others.  In total, I've helped more than 15 companies exit and there are more in the works.  Baseline is proud to be a seed investor associated with such promising companies as Instagram, Twitter, Weebly, Formspring, Heroku (acquired by Saleforce.com), CoTweet (acquired by ExactTarget), GeoAPI (acquired by Twitter), IndexTank (acquired by LinkedIn), Rupture (acquired by EA), Sendori (acquired by Ask.com), Parakey (acquired by Facebook), Versely (acquired by Cisco), Aardvark and DocVerse (both acquired by Google) and Hunch (acquired by eBay).",1332699646,1452908450

After going through a succession of the early consoles I finally got my hands on an almost real computer in 1983, a Timex Sinclair TS-1000, which had a whopping 1K of memory, and no usable software. I worked my way up from there, through C, VB (don&#x27;t hate), Perl, Cold Fusion, the .NET stack (mostly C#), Javascript + JQuery, and most recently Ruby on Rails.<p>I&#x27;m also loving Ubuntu, if that means anything to you.<p>Feel free to check out my CV at http://careers.stackoverflow.com/steverb.<p>My blog is at: http://steverb.com<p>If you think I could help your project, feel free to contact me via email at me@steverb.com.<p>http://strictlydev.com/devs/steverb",1251297867,1450207814

5256099,comment,5255209,5255209,8,0,coffeemug,,,"My company has a really good chance of succeeding, but I still face these doubts every day. Here are some of the things that make the game worth the candle for me, even if we end up failing:<p><pre><code>  * I'm proud of the product we've built. Even if it doesn't take off,
    nobody can take that away from me.

  * I'm incredibly proud of my engineering team. We're ""a bunch of kids""
    who've built something incredible. Even if the company ultimately
    doesn't survive, we will have done really well.

  * I love my work and I love the people I work with. There are
    conflicts, sometimes I have to deliver bad news, deal with stress
    and monotonous work, firefight problems, etc. but in aggregate the
    work I do and the people I do it with bring me joy. I will always
    remember this time fondly.

  * When I started, I was a good engineer and a terrible product
    manager. Now I'm a good engineer and a good product manager, which
    makes me 100x more valuable. There is a bazillion other things I've
    learned, but this alone makes everything worthwhile.

  * Facing doubt every day made me face the darkest corners of my
    soul. I stopped being an obnoxious cynical windbag and started
    appreciating the nuances of life, people, art, poetry, strength of
    human spirit and true magnitude of human dignity.

  * We're taking a real shot at building hard, sustainable technology
    that has a good chance to change the world. Even if we fail, I'll
    never regret taking the chance.

  * I met hundreds of people on my path. I dismissed some of them, but
    in retrospect I've learned from them all. I appreciate humanity a
    lot more now, and I understand where the dark parts of it come from
    much better.

  * Perspective is worth 80 IQ points. If you start a company you gain a
    lot of perspective.
</code></pre>
I could keep going, but I hope I've made my point. I'm not trying to sugar-coat anything -- failing may very well be the worst thing you've ever experienced emotionally to date. But keep everything in perspective and don't get cynical. You might still change the world in a big way. You might still change it in a small way. It doesn't matter. Enjoy the people around you. Get into adventures. Try to do something meaningful. Do the best you can -- things may not turn out how you wanted them to, but they'll probably turn out ok.",1361433450

They knew what they were getting into.""  In our case, this is simply not true, and we can't be the only startup in this position.<p>All of our funding so far was raised from my personal friends and family.

It is very difficult for me to not think of our failure as a betrayal of their trust.

Are you saying that Activision should kill CoD and fund the next Angry Birds so they could sell more copies of a cheaper game, or are you saying that CoD could sell 50 million copies if it was priced at $10?<p>Both of those claims are questionable. I am pretty sure Activision is scared shitless of becoming the next Rovio, and I doubt CoD would even break even being priced at $10.<p>Considering that CoD had a 200 million dollar budget, they would need to sell 20 million copies to break even vs 3.33 million, and consider to date (4 months) they have sold 20 million copies.<p>Even if such a price cut caused sales to double, you would have:<p>20 million * $60 * 30% - $200 million = $160 million dollars<p>40 million * $10 * 70% - $200 million = $80 million dollars.<p>Again, they would break even with their old model if they sold ~50 million copies, however, I don't think ""hardcore"" gaming is that price sensitive, and I doubt we would see a 150% increase in sales if you cut CoD's price to $10.<p>Lastly, where would these people come from? I don't think Activision has an untapped market 5x their current market size that want to buy Call of Duty but only for $10. Even if you talk about opening to the ""casual"" market, Nintendo showed us just how toxic that is. Casual gamers don't buy games. I'm sure its a lot smarter to sell to the gamer who buy 3 games a year @ $60, than it so to sell to 5 people who will buy 1 game /year @ $10. So if Activision could sell 50 million copies of CoD, would that stick them in the same position as Rovio, where all they can do is sell CoD, while WoW and Diablo bleed cash?",1361432894

Access and use
M1. Reasonable provision shall be made for
people to:
(a) gain access to; and (b) use
the building and its facilities.'[0]
There is then a whole set of pre approved conventions for what constitutes 'reasonable provision'. But crucially if you could show that, say, maglev chariots would satisfy this part of the regulation rather than a ramp then you can do this. About 10 years ago I also worked briefly on a building in New York and I was surprised how inflexible the building codes were. I don't claim to fully understand the code, but in some cases the law even appeared to specify a particular manufacturers products had to be used. From this, I suspect that the US has a culture of writing over complicated and voluminous laws, but I don't know enough to say if this is really the case. Maybe someone can argue otherwise?

Rapgenius' nodes, as well as all of Heroku's internal infrastructure (e.g. routing) run as EC2 virtual machines. EC2 VMs are multitenant environments because you share them with other virtual machines. The disk, CPU, and network are all virtualized, shared resources, with wildly varying latency, throughput, and reliability characteristics.<p>RapGenius doesn't need a hundred nodes to do their routing, but Heroku does, because they're responsible for lots of customers pushing a large volume of traffic. Their routing infrastructure needs to share global state about which dynos are available for which applications, (and which <i>versions of those applications</i>) belong to a given HTTP request, and that routing infrastructure is broadly distributed. I'd phrase their routing TCP load as ""nontrivial"", in the sense that if I had to build a system like this on physical hardware in, say, Portland, I'd start by buying five floors in the Pittock building.<p>That's not to say Heroku's architecture is <i>optimal</i>, just that their problem is not as easy as it may appear.<p>[edit] As for <i>why</i> companies choose to run in a heavily virtualized environment which has so many drawbacks... it comes down to a tradeoff in time, personnel, and costs. Running in EC2 allows for dramatically shorter lead times in hardware acquisition--and when your customers can increase their traffic by an order of magnitude without warning, I think that comes in handy. It also frees them from running their own power, network, physical security, hardware acquisition pipeline, associated vendor contracts, etc. I suspect both Heroku and RapGenius have weighed these costs carefully, but I don't really know their specific constraints.",1361431368

And to top it off, you're a high school <i>sophomore</i>. Most HS seniors never get internships either.<p>I'll second what jfaucett said. It is much more important to show 1-2 projects that you actually shipped, rather than 10 projects you never finished. This should make intuitive sense.<p>Things on your resume that are not very impressive: 1) Your GPA (high school GPAs are meaningless to a startup) 2) Software Dev Club VP (high school club leadership is meaningless to a startup)<p>Honestly, it's a turn off when the first 3 things I see on your resume are that you're a sophomore in HS, your GPA, and a club leadership position, since I know how meaningless those things are. You should put your experience/projects at the top, since those are the most impressive. I'm not saying that you shouldn't include those other things (GPA, club), but they should be at the bottom of your resume.<p>Some notes 1) Get your app on the Google Play store. 2) Add a link to your django-based news aggregator 3) Countervail is down. Get a version up on your own domain (randallma.com) and link to it just so you can show it off.<p>In fact, you should get your personal website up and running so that you can have a digital resume that actually <i>shows</i> people your projects (with links and screenshots). A drab resume is not going to get past HR.<p>Your Hackers&Founders description also has a grammar error.<p>Finally, the high school students I know who got internships at software companies ALL had some sort of inside connection - typically through their parents or a family friend.

I've been leading a team the past couple months building my first major app that has traction.  It's been a roller coaster already but today we were able to get a version into TestFlight and see it on my phone.  It sucks, it's still buggy, and it's not up to my standards yet but it was the most exciting thing seeing something that isn't perfect yet come to fruition.  Something I've thought about and lost sleep over and spent countless hours designing and planning.  It's finally starting to come alive and I'm leading a team of awesome developers that are making it happen and it's so exciting seeing it become real.<p>Now I know that you had to have this feeling with whatever you built.  Remember back to those times you kept refreshing the page to see how many new users or page views you had since the last time you refreshed.  You were excited about it.  You were elated to a point where you felt you were unstoppable.  What happened from here?  Really ask yourself this.  Ask what roads you took that lead you to where you are.  Just saying you 'ran out of innovation' is a pretty crappy excuse.  Some decisions you let happen led you to where you are today.<p>What I want you to see is a glimpse of that same spark you felt 2 years ago when you first launched and when you were building your app.  I am in the opposite state of mind as you are currently.  Things are looking good for me but that's because I choose to see it that way.  Even when things are crap, I know that I can make them better if my heart is in it and I trust my gut.<p>You have the same power.  You've already admitted defeat and chose to fail.  You said it yourself, you're going to fail in two months and I've already given up.  YOU CANNOT let your mind get in that state.  Find out what is blocking you from taking it to the next level and get there.  If you are a true entrepreneur at heart, find that spirit you had in the early days.  It's not hopeless, it's just what you see it as.<p>You can be another story of failure or you could just as easily be a story of success.  It is what you make it.  I don't believe that there is no way out and you're doomed to fail because your lack of innovation.  Some things you should kill if they don't work, but you better be damn sure it won't work because it's a bad model and not because your innovation just ran out.<p>You wrote this and posted it to HN.  You're trying to find a way out or you're trying to find out what to do next.  I'm telling you.  Search deep inside yourself.  Remember you only live once.  You were given a good chance based on that initial passion and energy you had.  Find that again.  Figure out what you need to do to turn things around and do them.  If it's killing them fine, but kill it being happy and confident.  If you need support or someone to talk to, my email is in my profile.  Whoever you are, if we are at all in like minded spirits, you just have to dig deep to overcome this mountain, and before long you will regain that vision and compass of where to go.<p>Edit: a few words",1361430551

Compare the solutions and balance opinions of Dustin ""Rocks are Balanced"" Browder to Sean ""Day[9]"" Plott, for example.<p>In the mutalisk stacking example, it ended up being a very good thing in terms of metagame balance. At the time, top Zerg players were having tremendous problems breaching Terran static defenses, and it proved to be relatively ""fair"" for them to have that option in the mid-game. Also worth noting is that just because it's simple doesn't make it easy; it still required good APM/Micro to manage and a solid understanding of the magic-boxing techniques.<p>Even now, in SC2, the idea that workers don't collide with each other when given a command to mine a remote mineral patch is necessary at high levels of play to use the drone drilling technique in order to avoid a pylon ramp-block, which is an extremely simple technique for the protoss to use, but disproportionately difficult situation for the Zerg to deal with.

This is really painful to read.<p>This is one reason why I will never take money from an external investor. There are some scenarios when you definitely need an investor's help. But right now, the trend is almost like ""it's a cool factor to seek investment for your startup"".<p>The problem with taking money from someone else is that, you become obligated/answerable to them. Remember, we all start-up because we don't want to go down the traditional working-for-a-corporate route, because we don't want to be answerable/obey no one/their orders. But seeking investment (in most cases) just defeats this purpose of starting up.<p>Why the hell would someone want to be answerable to a third party for running YOUR company in YOUR way?? And what happens when that company fails? You need to either apologize/console the investor that you will somehow get back his money. Contrast this with having no investors at all, worst case scenario would be you lost all your money. But that's much better than losing someone else's.<p>I find nothing wrong in trying to build an Saas that generates $10000-$50000 a month in revenue from day one,  without external investment, instead of seeking millions in investment for a bunch of photo filters on a phone only to later worry about monetizing the idea.",1361430132

I'd prefer .NET/Mono over Java (and i'd prefer python and C over .NET), but it doesn't look like there's support for that..<p>Last time i tried to get MonoDevelop with those Android tools to check out cross-platform app development with Mono and it's a no-go. Now Xamarin Studio appears to be Mac and Windows only. Very disappointing!",1361430088

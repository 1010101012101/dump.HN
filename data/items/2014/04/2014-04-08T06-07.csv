They&#x27;ve basically left the bad taste of the virulent boycott hanging around <i>despite getting exactly the change they wanted</i>.<p>So yes, it was a witch hunt - they only cared about destroying Eich, not strengthening Mozilla, and were happy to damage their Mozillan allies (that they purported to be defending) in the process.<p>Besides, it&#x27;s possible (and common) for both sides in an argument to be wrong.",1396940351

Like many a political scandal, this became a full-blown crisis not because of the original issue but because of how poorly Eich managed it.  If Eich had -- like countless other public figures -- expressed a change in point of view on this issue, this would have blown over.  As it stood, his recalcitrant stand on the issue was (and is) indefensible, the unwillingness to so much as discuss it was arrogant and the non-apology was patronizing -- but the inability to see how and why he was failing spoke to a much deeper incompetence.  Eich is clearly not the stuff that CEOs are made of, and Mozilla as an organization is probably (ultimately) lucky to have figured that out so quickly.",1396939058

Also, people care more about your current position than what you believed half a decade ago. Obviously OkCupid&#x27;s CEO has come around on this position (if indeed he ever was anti-gay). Or he is putting on the public appearance of having come around, which for activism&#x27;s purpose is sufficient.<p>If Eich had come out in support of gay people during this fiasco (for example, saying something as simple as, &quot;I was wrong, I&#x27;m sorry, if I had it to do again, I would not donate to that campaign&quot;), I&#x27;m willing to bet that the calls to remove him would have dropped in volume by a <i>substantial</i> margin. This isn&#x27;t apples to apples, and it&#x27;s not even apples to oranges. It&#x27;s apples to pick up trucks.",1396938026

Is it absurd to judge Yagan as a person based on a single donation, years ago, to a politician well known for waging war on gays? Yup.

Specifically, Yagan donated $500 to Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah) in 2004, reports Uncrunched. During his time as congressman from 1997 to 2009, Cannon voted for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, against a ban on sexual-orientation based job discrimination, and for prohibition of gay adoptions.&quot;<p>So donating to a campaign for a constitutional ammendment prohibiting gay marriage is the same as donating to a politician with a broad array of other policies?

7551681,comment,7551134,7551478,1,0,bertil,,,"I appreciate the intent to use random citizens to hold power, but prosecutor might be the position where years of professional training matters. Remember what Churchill said about five minutes with the average voters? Well, there is one bigger scandal in any democracy (it is actually mentioned in the article) and that’s how much someone accused of anything, specially if he happens to be unattractive, socially isolated, poor and male, is presumed guilty. This is far worst for ‘random people’, and allowing non-experts to choose who to prosecute without consequence would lead to spectacular injustices.<p>That’s why it is the jury who is made of inexperienced citizens selected at random: prosecutors now have the burden to convince them all, including those who empathise with the accused. They are judged over their career by how their prejudice leads them to bad cases, and prevents them from winning cases.<p>If prosecutors saw acquittals as failure on their part, and need to re-consider their world-view, that would work. I believe the article and the judge see the problem as them seeing such (rare) events as abuse of the system against them, personification of the innocent defendent public, and that’s the source of the issue.",1396937761

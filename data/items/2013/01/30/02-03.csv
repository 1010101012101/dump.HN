I will put your product in front of this person, and it will be up to them to decide to trial, or not.  I am just speaking from my experience on both the selling side, and on the buying side, pricing at a significant premium (be that 1.5X or 6X) to existing players is going to make it very tough to break into any market.\nAs such, why not price cheaper now?  If you price flat to the competition, but offer a clearly better product that's a tried and true method of grabbing market share.  With market share your brand equity will increase and you can raise prices later as you gain pricing power.",1359514451

There are no cultures where diseased and ulcerated skin on the face is considered sexy. ""But of course"" you might say - but that's the point, we take the real commonalities for granted.<p>And then, yes, on top of those there is a whole conflicting mess of different desirable appearances which depend upon the period, culture, and person, driven by all the complexities of interacting human beings. But those factors can be boiled down to some fairly simple drives which have all emerged for one reason: to maximise reproductive success.<p>Which is all what you would expect from the result of selection pressures acting across tens of thousands of successful generations of descendants of ancient DNA-replicating machines.<p>Another way to say this is that it is in our nature to be highly responsive to environmental conditions, i.e. nurture. Nature builds the platform and tools needed for nurture to occur - but just because we are plastic in the face of nurture does not mean nurture negates or transcends the principles of nature (at least not so far, I believe.) If individuals had arisen in which this was so, they would have been selected against. You should read The Language Instinct, Steven Pinker makes this point about people who try and argue that the brain is effectively infinitely plastic and comes with no built-in ""software"" for processing and generating language.<p>(PS The main complication in trying to read human behaviour for evolutionary logic is that selection principles do not act upon individuals solely, because humans are all integrated into often multiple kin and common-identity networks of greater or lesser complexity. Evolutionary logic resolves at the level of these more-complicated networks.)<p>(PPS I believe that the head size-hip ratio theory is erroneous.

5137653,comment,5136031,5136031,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I actually disagree to some extent with Raganwald here.  I am both a software engineer and an amateur linguist.  Let me try to go into where my disagreement is.  I figure that someone, <i>probably me,</i> will have to set the record straight about how poorly our expectations of English grammar match the realities and utilities of this language.[1]<p>Natural languages and computer languages are very different both in how they are used and in the constraints that exist on them.  It is very obvious that you can't write programs in written English for that reason, and the only reason why we have this confusion is not what we expect from programming languages but what we expect from natural languages.<p>As every introductory linguistics textbook will remind you, natural languages are defined by usage patterns.  Computer languages however are defined by parser behavior.  They must be rigorously specified, while such specification kills natural languages.<p>Many people, particularly public school English teachers, would like to see English specified to this level of clean, precise, prescriptive rules, but this doesn't really work in practice.  Different dialects occur and these dialects often have very different features (note the habitual tenses in African American Vernacular English, for example, which also occurs in some dialects from England).  Usage defines the language, just like it can define good/bad coding practices in one school of thought or another, but usage does not define C.  If I decide there is a clearer way to handle pointers, what I come up with isn't C any more.  However habitual tenses (""I be workin' Tuesdays"") as much as they may be seen as ""bad English"" by some prescriptivists, are just natural, organic developments within the language.<p>There are also dialects of English that are less imprecise.  For example consider legalese which is often considered to be a hyper-defined dialect of English (also a very formulaic one).  The advantage is that legalese can fall back to other English terms for additional meaning and one can be reasonably sure what a contract means even if you are not a lawyer.<p>So what does this mean about English-Likeness?  Certainly we wouldn't expect the laws of the nation and contracts to be written in a purely symbolic language even though these need a level of definition well beyond what ordinary everyday English can provide.   In fact if we did so, this would interfere with the function of legal instruments.  Legalese may be a hyper-defined dialect but at the end of the day, it is still just as much English as African American Vernacular English is.  English likeness is more a blessing than a curse in the field of law, even though it is quite clearly both.<p>Because English-Likeness is both a blessing and a curse there, it is worth asking the same here.  Can an ordinary individual read a program written in Perl or Python and understand it?  No, but that same ordinary individual probably cannot read the Supreme Court's opinion in Pedilla v. Hanft, or Hamdi v. Rumsfeld either and really understand what the court is arguing about.<p>But what English-likeness does is it speeds up learning.  There is a difference between how quickly you can pick up Spanish as an English speaker and how quickly you can pick up Bahasa Indonesia or Algonquin.  Spanish in both structure and vocabulary is much closer to English than either one is to Indonesian or Algonquin, so I think the same applies, and languages which follow very different structures (lisp reminds me of Irish Gaelic due to the latter's VSO word order) tend not to gain much traction.<p>Additionally English is probably the best language in the world to be like for a programming language.  We have a relatively simple lexical structure and a fairly inflexible word order and much of this is due to the fact that Middle English arose as a sort of creole (with all the grammatical simplification that goes with that) between Anglo-Saxon and Old Norman French.  Other creoles might be good choices too, but this is a good choice and we might as well stick with it.<p>[1]  Note, we would never say ""Me will have to"" and yet within the parenthetical, the normal rules of pronoun cases get shifted a bit.

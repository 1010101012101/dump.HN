Its hard not to notice that the swiss and the nordic countries (especially Sweden and Norway) value a certain aesthetics. This expresses itself in many things, ranging from architecture to product design, art and the design of public spaces.<p>There is a reason swiss typography was big, and why nordic design is appreciated all over the world. It could only emerge from these cultural surroundings, its a mindset.<p>That plug is an expression of british engineering values. Its certainly a very well designed plug, but I also believe the reason why swiss and nordic products are more popular than british ones is that they are made with a different approach.<p>Probably those same values are also the reason why british music is so great, and why swiss music is... oh well, have you ever listened to mundart-rock?

My attorney over there, Jeffrey Klein <a href=""http://www.goodwinprocter.com/People/K/Klein-Jeffrey.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodwinprocter.com/People/K/Klein-Jeffrey.aspx</a> could potentially refer you to someone either within the firm who specializes in IP or perhaps a less expensive alternative. GP is seriously among the very best in the business. If what you&#x27;re doing is as cool as it seems and you have the large corporation as an employer, you&#x27;re going to potentially face some big-league legal issues; potentially you signed an agreement with your employer when you started work that might potentially give them right of first refusal to any tech you invent. I certainly have no idea, but those sorts of agreements aren&#x27;t uncommon. As a result, you&#x27;re going to have your company&#x27;s lawyers looking into it as well, which means that you need the best representation you can afford.<p>However, before you get to that point, if it were me, I&#x27;d think long and hard about the business you hope to build on top of the software. If that business seems viable, given that you&#x27;re giving away the source code, then your legal expense might be worth it.<p>However, and I&#x27;m certainly not &quot;advising&quot; you, I would consider talking to an attorney about patent implications. An Open Patent, for instance might be something to look into. This would prevent someone else (for example your employer or some other user) from creating a patent based on the specific domain of your creation and it would protect the open source users from potential patent infringement claims. I&#x27;m certainly not a lawyer, but the issues I mention are all worthy of discussion with legal minds much more experienced than you or me.<p>Key points:<p>You need a lawyer to review your employment agreement to ensure you&#x27;re &quot;in the clear.&quot;\nEvaluate the viability of the business itself.\nYou should discuss all of your options for your technology, license types, patents, etc.\nYou also might consider forming a business entity, then &quot;hiring&quot; yourself to create the software. If your employer doesn&#x27;t have a restriction on dual employment, this could be a strategy to subvert any &quot;right of first refusal&quot; clause that might be in your employment agreement.<p>However, I present these ideas only as discussion points with your attorney. I barely know what I&#x27;m talking about and you really can&#x27;t safely google your way to success when it comes to these issues.

I think you mean communism, evidenced by the article&#x27;s mentions of Engels and Marx, which has pretty clearly failed in spectacular fashion everywhere it&#x27;s been tried. I found the point that building out the infrastructure for industrialisation was incredibly capital intensive and so labour wage rises weren&#x27;t really an option interesting, because of course that&#x27;s exactly how it played out in industrialising communist countries as well. It&#x27;s just that the state held on to the capital instead of industrialists (or rather the industrialists holding the capital were part of the state).<p>Interestingly, China now seems to be going through the equivalent of the late 19th century phase where labour wages begin to rise roughly in line with productivity. They&#x27;ve largely built out their core infrastructure and mopped up most of the spare labour pool. China&#x27;s development has been a huge factor in the economic conditions in the west.

The exceptions the article discusses are the mobile money consumers in Africa, but here the conventional remittance fees are also a lot lower.<p>A quick apples to apples comparison suggests that converting sterling to Kenyan Shilling denominated M-PESA mobile money costs around 4-5% including forex and fees via Western Union and Moneygram (unlikely to be the cheapest of many providers in the marketplace) whilst sending to M-PESA via the BBC-advertised remittance services costs a 3% forex fee plus cost of obtaining Bitcoin (surprisingly expensive if your salary is paid in GBP; I&#x27;m struggling to see any options below 1%, and the cheaper ones aren&#x27;t instant either).<p>There might be an advantage for the Bitcoin remittance services, but perhaps not one worth the additional inconvenience, delay and counterparty risk.

Still, if he made the cut I'd read his interview voraciously anyway. <p>I'm not looking forward to Molyneux, though.

Which means, in the narrow sense of the word, that startup ideas are worthless.""<p>What I mean when I say playing with words is that he qualified that statement with ""in the narrow sense of the word."" He was also referring to startup ideas in particular.<p>This discussion is getting to be a little ridiculous because you're splitting hairs and and missing the point entirely.

(assuming other conditions like non-obviousness etc apply).
Even if someone patents before you, you can still patent it (if you wrote it down with proof of date) and claim royalties. (example, the laser).<p>3) Have you read about the numerous lawsuits in the entertainment world about <i>ideas</i> for a TV show or book being stolen and executed? There are <i>no</i> prototypes to steal - just ideas, but they carry weight in court.

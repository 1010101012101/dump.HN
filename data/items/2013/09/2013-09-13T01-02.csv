6378114,comment,6376198,6377426,4,0,adriand,,,"Thanks, that is a super interesting talk!  He posits one mechanism for how the octopus might be able to colour-match while being colour-blind, which is the presence of distributed light sensing pigments in the skin - a molecule for this, &quot;opsin&quot;, can be found in the skin of cuttlefish and squid (and maybe octopi too, he didn&#x27;t say).<p>He says that although the pigment they have found for light-sensing is the same one they have found in the eye, and thus only indicates that the skin may be able to &quot;see&quot; a single colour (i.e. is also colour-blind), the research suggests that other pigments may exist, or that some other mechanism like refraction of nearby chromatophores (pigmented and/or light-reflecting cells) may allow those pigments to detect more than just a single colour.<p>When I was first trying to imagine how a colour-blind octopus could colour-match itself to its surroundings, one thought I had was how a deaf person can sense sound via felt vibrations.  Based on the frequency of the vibration, pitch can be inferred.  In a way, that is sort of similar to what he suggests is happening with the light-sensing pigments in the skin - the information the organism requires is fed to it via its skin rather than the organs typically used for this task, the eyes.",1379037432

Which means you only accept reads from slaves but slaves are unresponsive because of the index generation. In this state, if you try to do anything fancy your data will go corrupt. Only way out is to wait through the outage (which I find it pretty hard to do so). This is still not solved in 2.4, waiting for 2.6.<p>Replica sets with all secondaries which can&#x27;t elect a primary because it lost a node, or the mostly random primary-secondary switches that drops all connections, seldomly primary reelecting itself meanwhile dropping connections for no apparent reasons.

Because it is at least deterministic, which in mongo nothing really is.<p>Postgres supports free form json, XML or hstore document formats by the way, couchDb has its own specific features as a document db too.

You&#x27;d need something much longer and less prone to errors, like SHA. Otherwise you&#x27;d be getting lots of weird problems as the CPU triggers the backdoor constantly.
- More complex hashing would take more memory and lots of CPU time, something that would doubtfully be available to at the microcode level. If every instruction computed a non-trivial hash, someone would quickly notice performance issues ;)
- Shorting the RNG would produce some very suspicious results, and anyone looking at any kind of fuzzed tests, testing encryption strength, or running tests against something like OpenSSL would quickly discover the backdoor.
- Any kind of &quot;the next comparison is always true&quot; would easily trip even the most basic of unit tests, and it would happen every time. Making it only happen randomly might help, but would likely still be found relatively quickly.",1379036649
6378071,comment,6376934,6377780,35,0,zanny,,,"My personal impression is that the rise of advertising has emerged from the collapse of disposable income. In a world where everyone has wealth to spend, it is better to just make more goods people want to buy as efficiently as possible. In a world where everyone is poor, and losing money to capital siphoning through the rich (who do not evenly reinvest this capital into the economy, and expect reliable returns meaning more long term concentration of money), advertising becomes more relevant because you compete over scarce dollars and more so need to motivate purchases through psychological breaking down of a targets resistance to splurge buy something of yours.<p>When actually making more goods doesn&#x27;t make you more money (at least commodity goods, there is a growing market for the absurd luxury goods targeting those that own dividend stocks and have multiple houses and personal chefs) your alternative is to use psychological manipulation to drive the limited dollars towards your goods, even if it means the per-unit cost is higher. You make the gambit - persuade someone to buy, or don&#x27;t sell at all because your product isn&#x27;t really that competitve anymore when you are spending upwards of 30% of your budget on ads.<p>Look no further than the evolution of the video game industry - since it is so new, it also shows this effect strongly, where the biggest titles like the CoD games can see 80% of their budget spent on advertising (cursory google search to get these numbers on the latest title, Black Ops 2, turned up nothing citeable). If you spend $28 million making a game, and $120 - 200 million on ads, your economic model must be fucked.<p>So because you compete for scarce dollars, customers aren&#x27;t coming to you, you need to manipulate customers into spending money they don&#x27;t have. Hence why advertising is so huge, even with 1% click-through rates. All that concentrated wealth getting reinvested has limited alternative options of where to go, so you just try to pry more money out of people through bombardment.",1379036619

Yes it&#x27;s backwards that a major part of conferences is the party scene, and somewhat disconcerting to hear JSConf was selling party-only tickets. This perpetuates a drinking culture that no industry needs.<p>However, even with those flaws, but I don&#x27;t see it as mandatory, exclusive, or a barrier to entry.

When my team celebrated a huge event, we had a bottle of champagne accompanied by a nice bottle of non-alcoholic sparking lemonade / beverage.

In order for evolution to get from A to B, there must be a path of incremental advantageous changes to get from here to there. It can&#x27;t magically leap from one optimum to another. So you see things like the way the same basic body plan is reused endlessly in the natural world; with only incremental changes available to create the next species, you can&#x27;t create a whole new body plan from scratch, even if it would be completely appropriate due to, say, transitioning from land to water. It is also completely goalless; if there is a fantastic two-gene change that a species could make, even if both are individually advantageous, there&#x27;s no particular force that will cause them to occur [1].<p>Evolution is both very powerful, with many people underestimating it, and profoundly <i>stupid</i>, with many people also <i>over</i>estimating it. Once humans really get cracking with the gene engineering (which has proved harder than we had initially hoped, but I&#x27;m still confident we&#x27;ll get there), I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find a plethora of relatively simple changes we can make to natural organisms that may involve changing three or four genes simultaneously where no single change is advantageous, which is a thing that evolution essentially can&#x27;t do.<p>[1]: Or at least, not yet... one bizarre-ish, &quot;Selfish Gene&quot; way of looking at human gene engineering is evolution evolving itself a way to make those multi-gene changes. Still not in a directed fashion, of course. But evolution will still apply to our own gene engineered creations, just possibly with a very different set of constraints, such as potentially severing the billion-year-old connection between fitness and direct biological reproduction... as I&#x27;ve said on HN before, you don&#x27;t have to be a full-on &quot;Rapture of the Nerds&quot;-style Singulatarian to see that the future may get <i>very</i> weird....",1379034774

Why the author did that should be obvious. He wanted to write a story that would sell.&quot;<p>Well, if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m sure about, it&#x27;s that selling books wasn&#x27;t why Krakauer was compelled to tell that story.<p>Reading Krakauer&#x27;s accounts of his own life, in both Into The Wild and in Eiger Dreams, it&#x27;s pretty clear he felt the same urge to challenge himself with the wilderness that McCandless did, and that the books are Krakauer&#x27;s attempts to understand that drive.<p>Those books are mainly journeys of self-understanding that happen to be available for other people to read.",1379034087

Wikipedia, as well as the movie and a variety of primary sources make it clear that one was found among his possession. It&#x27;s also possible, if not likely, that the onset of lathyrism left him no window for realizing his plight and walking out - the damage was irreversible at the time of ingestion (I&#x27;m admittedly sketchy on how fast the onset actually is - presumably it varies a lot).<p>Personally, I find the details completely beside the point. McCandless sacrificed everything to test his philosophical conjecture and I have nothing but respect for that. I honestly would&#x27;ve thought there&#x27;d be more empathy for it here.",1379034062

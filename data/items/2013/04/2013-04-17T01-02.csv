If there is a 1% chance the world will end unless we do x, we shouldnt do a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, assuming x is feasible, we should simply do it.<p>This is extraordinarily dangerous thinking. The ""One Percent Doctrine"" [1] is and was a huge driver behind the rationale for all the national security and counter-terrorism efforts in the post September 11th era - former Vice President Cheney is recounted as saying ""If there's a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping al-Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon, we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response."" That very same logic was likely extended to Iraq - if there is a 1% chance Saddam is building WMDs, we must invade (it helps that the Bush Administration believed the chance was far greater than 1%).<p>Another problem with this 1% kind of thinking is that it's not even clear <i>if</i> many of the kinds of events that are purported to end the world would actually end the world - global warming won't cause human extinction; it will just cause hundreds of millions, if not a billion, deaths (through disease, flooding, displacement); the same applies for nuclear holocast.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Percent_Doctrine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Percent_Doctrine</a><p>EDIT: I realized the irony is that you could call this the ""Dangers of Thinking Like a Politician.""",1366163047

I've been working for almost 8 years since I was booted out, but I've talked to counselors there and the path back in is straightforward. I have to do two semesters of CC and then re-apply. The counselor made it seem like as long as I get a B or better avg. during those two semesters, the re-apply process is a mere formality.<p>I'm super excited to finally be able to finish my degree, and really looking forward to being a student again. I've hit a plateau in my career by not having my bachelor's. I get paid about 120k now, but I think I need the degree for the more formal hardcore stuff. I want to do data science, big data, or more hardcore stuff. I've been doing enterprise, web app, reporting type stuff that I'm really tired of. It'll also just be a personal goal.<p>I've saved up for 3-4 years and I have almost 70K in the bank (plus maxed out 401k + employer matching for the past 5 years) to fund my degree. I even hope to do a masters if any program will have me at that point.<p>Even though I have a bit of money saved up, I want to at least have some form of income while I'm in school. I'd rather not graduate with $0 to my name. So I want to know what the best thing for me to do right now to start preparing. I'm planning to move back to the bay area in Jan 2014 and start CC then, so that's my timeline. I am thinking that I either need to set up some ""passive income"" in the form of mobile apps maybe, or start a freelancing or consulting side gig. I think the latter is more realistic.

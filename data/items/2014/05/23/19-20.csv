He went to Adobe with a proposal for the hooks into the Flash player that he needed and worked with their engineers to get those hooks working.  I don&#x27;t doubt there was a fair amount of work on Adobe&#x27;s side, too, but it wasn&#x27;t like Adobe had the technology in place before Ran started working with them.<p>Ran came up with an API for the hooks he needed that didn&#x27;t give away too much of the most clever parts of what he was doing.  The belief was that Google would get the hooks it wanted and in return, Adobe could share the special Flash player with other major search engines and everyone would be indexing Flash content.  The hope was that Google would just be doing it a bit more cleverly than the competition.  I&#x27;m not sure if any of the other major search engines ever used the hooks Ran designed.<p>Source: I worked on Google&#x27;s rich content indexing team from 2006 to 2010.

7791002,comment,7790065,7790065,5,0,ciokan,,,"Had a few panic attacks 2 years ago in the summer. I was working too much (I still do) as an entrepreneur, drinking too much coffee without drinking enough water (coffee tends to dehydrate your body) and my blood too thick from that so it came to me as a sort of dizziness which transformed into a full blown panic attack and an ambulance shortly after that.<p>I refused pills from day one and found that, by training my mind to say &quot;bring it on! is this the best you can do&quot; tends to stop the anxiety on it&#x27;s ascension. I go to gym 3 times a week now to to some actual exercise and calm the body a bit. I now am panic free for almost 2 years but I still have the symptoms. What changed is my attitude when the symptoms arrive, it&#x27;s already in my subconscious and my body does it automatically.<p>I blame our jobs just like OP and I blame the fact that our job is a whole brainstorm from start to finish. No physical challenge at all and our bodies are not used to it. Our bodies need some physical activity to do it&#x27;s chemistry and release new stuff periodically so we can function properly otherwise some glands get messed up (this is my own conclusion I didn&#x27;t hear it from anywhere) so our bodies get unbalanced and stressed. Too much of something is called an addiction and no addiction is left unpunished. We really need to take a break from time to time and just work out or meditate a bit for our body to adjust or at least recover.<p>No past generation was so technical and multi tasked and so stressed from morning till dawn. We&#x27;re probably at the border of evolution right now and nature is adjusting us/itself. Future generations will probably deal with this entirely different than us but our bodies are like an old motherboard with a super chip plugged in right now. It&#x27;s getting burnt. We need some better cooling.<p>The worst thing about panic attacks is that you have nobody to talk to that can really understand what you&#x27;re going through apart from others who had it. You can&#x27;t explain it to someone who didn&#x27;t because you can even see them smiling...&quot;so...basically you&#x27;re afraid huh?&quot;. They can&#x27;t comprehend the feeling that you&#x27;re going to die, right now; that you&#x27;re probably so certain you&#x27;re going to die that you probably even said your last words and good byes in your mind. Just don&#x27;t complain to people any more because you will get a new addiction out of it.<p>Tl;DR: Do sports (swimming is good), less work (you van find yourself even more productive because productivity has few to do with how much we work), confront your demon when he comes to visit and don&#x27;t try to explain to people who never dealt with such a thing...they might make things worse.",1400874781

It&#x27;s better than bigger social sharing sites like Reddit in that tired jokes and posts with little thought are usually voted down to the bottom, but posts that poke holes in the original argument are often top comments.<p>A lot of technically-minded people take great pleasure in finding and fixing bugs. The problem is that finding errors in human interaction leads to pedantry, nitpicking, and cherry-picking. This is especially true as the community grows and interactions with all but the most visible people becomes rare. People have less incentive to give others the benefit of the doubt, and more incentive to find the problems and point them out.<p>I&#x27;m worried about our once-little community, but I don&#x27;t know how to prevent the petty fault-finding from resurfacing in such a large and shifting community.",1400874577

I <i>could</i> still program!  How did I get in the zone?  How do I get there again when I need it?  Well I worried about hat for a while, thinking there was some combo of sleep, nutrition, environment and task management software that I could line all up and get back to &quot;the zone&quot;.  It finally dawned on me that I subconsciously find distractions to avoid doing things I don&#x27;t want to do.  What a revelation.<p>How do I get over it?  Well I still struggle with it, but simply identifying the problem was a huge step towards fixing it.  Here are some techniques that I use:<p>Pomodoro technique.  This is a productivity trick that actually works pretty well for me.  The short version is that that you make a list of very small tasks, then work for twenty minutes (straight!  no phone, no emails, no coffee, no bathroom), then take a five minute break.  This helps with distraction problems because you can tell yourself, &quot;I can goof off in 7 minutes&quot;.  It sounds like a lot of interruptions, but I&#x27;m amazed at how much I get done with it.<p>Creating crisis.  I work harder with the Sword of Damocles hanging over me, so I put those swords there myself.  Call me back at 2:30 and I will have this done.  Then I&#x27;m good for two hours of, &quot;oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,&quot; type production.<p>Pair programming (and rubber ducking).  This really helps to power through crummy tasks.  Unfortunately, I work from home for a tiny company.  I don&#x27;t have anyone to program with.  But if I am really stuck, I can ask my wife to sit next to me, while I explain what I am doing, and what I am trying to accomplish, and the details of what I am coding as I code it.  I can use this occasionally to get over a hump.<p>Change of venue.  I have struggled to find some shitty bug in some shitty spagetti code for a crappy website selling stupid things for WAY too long.  The only way I broke through was to take my computer somewhere else, in front of other people.  David Sedaris has a great story about a book suggesting he make a change in his house to help him quit smoking. Buy a new couch or something in order to change the venue.  In our comfortable habitual surroundings we act in comfortable habitual ways.  So he moved to Japan to stop smoking.  I can&#x27;t do this every day, it&#x27;s just for breaking major blocks.<p>Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Good luck!",1400874339

Why can&#x27;t we have more win-win situations instead of more narrow use case wins that iOS and Android provide?<p>MS got ahead by appealing to a broad range of needs, users, and by playing ball with as many people as they possibly can.  Sure, that got us the kitchen-sink like Win8, but I imagine Win8.3 or Win9 will have solve a lot of those issues.  Ironically, MS has become the &#x27;friendly&#x27; software vendor.

This resulted in a very slight speed increase AND a pitch shift of less than a quartertone.❞<p>While technically true (less than a quartertone), it&#x27;s much, much, much less than a quartertone. It&#x27;s 1.7cent (1.7 percent of a half-tone, or 1/30th of a quartertone). If you accidentally mix up 48kHz and 44.1, it&#x27;s a much more noticable 1.5 half-tones. I doubt that this slight detuning is so blatantly obvious that it &quot;feaks out&quot; even a very well trained and very hot tempered classical violinist.<p>If you want to check the math: There are 12 semitones in an octave.

Say your company goes belly-up. Who cares? The school doesn&#x27;t care, you just go back to class and your parents start paying tuition again. You graduate with your degree, except now you have valuable experience and connections that help you get internships and jobs and maybe funding for your next startup.<p>You dropped out because you had a plan and a social and financial safety net that meant you had meaningful choices about your future. Dropping out was taking a shortcut, the life equivalent of jumping over the edge on Rainbow Road in Mario Kart 64. If you make it, you&#x27;re hugely ahead! And if you don&#x27;t, well you get picked up and put back on your original path and maybe you&#x27;re a little behind but really it&#x27;s no big deal.<p>Now think about an alternative scenario. You&#x27;re a low income kid who was the first in your family to go to college. You&#x27;re working 20 hours a week because your student loans cover tuition but nothing else at the giant-ass state school you go to. Your parents (you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones whose family stayed together) are cheering for you but they&#x27;re also laid-off and unemployment is running out and they&#x27;re not sure how they&#x27;re going to pay for dad&#x27;s pills and anyway they&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;re cut out to be in college and they&#x27;re worried you&#x27;ll fail. So you drop out because you&#x27;re struggling in some of your classes, and the shift manager at work offered you more hours and you say why the fuck not because the extra cash can&#x27;t hurt.<p>What do you think your options are when that company cuts back and lets you go in a year or two? Think you&#x27;ve saved enough after paying down the interest on your loans that you can go back to school and not work? Think that 2 years of credits and work experience at a dead end job is going to translate into a high-paying position at some solid company?<p>The point is, if you have a specific plan in which dropping out will advance your career and life interests and also have enough of a backup that you can recover from failure, then you should totally take a break and go do something exciting.<p>If you don&#x27;t, if a college degree is your lifeline to a better life than your parents&#x27; and you&#x27;re skating on a razor&#x27;s edge to be there in the first place, then just Stay In School, kid.<p>And now the rest of you stop debating the value of finishing college as if it meant the same thing to everyone and get off my lawn. Go back to work.",1400872816

Even more so if you have to compromise the experience for everyone else such that degrading is an option.<p>In some cases, you go out of your way to accommodate small fractions of your audience.

He was trained as a mathematician, so his explanations are crystal clear in terms of definitions and where physicists sweep mathematical formalisms under the rug. After watching his entire lecture for this course, and spending a lot of time reading the course reader, I learned a lot about how to decrypt the kind of mathematical nonsense that physicists tend to say (as well as learning about the real foundations, c.f. tempered distributions and others).<p>That being said, a lot of these lectures can be summarized in a few sentences if you already have a strong foundation in linear algebra. For example, the fact that complex exponentials form an orthonormal basis for periodic functions is the content of the first handful of lectures, and deriving the Fourier transform is only slightly messier to explain in terms of linear algebra (this is not because of the linear algebra but because Fourier transforms are inherently a little messy).",1400871880

7790813,comment,7789753,7790510,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"So the thing about a monopoly is it&#x27;s totally squishy. There isn&#x27;t a clear line you cross to become one because there is no clean way to define a market. Every customer places a different value on the product itself, the search and transportation cost of buying from alternative retailers, etc.<p>So take Walmart. Do they have a local monopoly? First, question, on what? If you want to buy a television then they almost certainly don&#x27;t, because they have strong competition from Amazon and six dozen other Internet retailers, and on top of that customers tend to be willing to drive out of town to save real money on a big ticket item.<p>But what about, say, groceries? That pretty much puts the Internet out of the running, because you can&#x27;t ship a single gallon of milk in a refrigerated truck for anything resembling a competitive price. So then the question is, how far away is the nearest local competitor? If it&#x27;s only a five minute drive, maybe that&#x27;s enough competition. If Walmart&#x27;s prices get out of hand people will start to make the drive. But what if it&#x27;s 15 minutes? 30 minutes? 45 minutes? What if a substantial portion of the local population doesn&#x27;t own a vehicle and that &quot;15 minute&quot; drive is a two hour walk? So maybe some Walmart stores have a local monopoly on groceries.<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more. If Walmart&#x27;s local prices start to get out of hand, how hard is it for a competitor to open up? It turns out the answer is, not very hard. A small grocery store is a one person operation. Low barrier to entry. If new competitors spring up six hours after Walmart raises their prices, they can&#x27;t actually raise their prices very much no matter how far away the nearest existing competitor is. Which is why, even in towns with only that one Walmart, it still doesn&#x27;t cost $20 for a gallon of milk.",1400871852

If they say yes, the people below them are directed to make it happen.<p>People not high up enough either say ""no"" or hand you up to someone who can definitively say ""yes.""  If they say no, the people above them never hear about it.<p>So clearly, dealing with people higher up improves your chances dramatically.<p>Brad Bird was the one who I first heard point this out:  ""Oftentimes the people at the top are really fun and the people on your way up are really fun, but there's something about a lot of middle managers -- people that don't have the power to say yes but do have the power to say no.""",1183195497

In comparison: I have never spent a dime on a Java book, in the 10 years that I have been using the language. On the other hand, I can't count how often I have downloaded the various available online docs, for example when I did consulting and used the clients computer. I also travel a lot, which has hampered my progress in Ruby (that book is heavy, so it stayed home) - OK, I should have bought the e-book, but still... <p>26$ is not a lot, but it is a lot if you are not sure if it is worth your money, or if it will fulfill all your needs. Is that the only Ruby book you'll ever need, or are more investments coming up (Rails book(s))? It's all about risks, in a way. Why else use Open Source Software? With Java, I know my needs are taken care of, and if I ever have a problem, I will find the answer for free, and fast.",1183195268

3864803,comment,3864043,3864698,5,0,shuzchen,,,"I agree with the parents that doubt the veracity of these claims.  There is so much more to a language than just vocabulary and grammar that I can't imagine anybody picking up on their own in 4-5 months.  For example, in Japanese, there are many levels of formality that affect the vocabulary you select as well as the way you say something.  And it's not just a matter of using one level with a particular person, how formal you are is very dynamic, and can change back and forth in the same conversation.  Also, it's pretty much impossible to reach a native level productiveness of giseigo and giongo (different types of mimetic words) without being born and raised there.<p>However, if you're a language maven, then I can see how you can obtain high fluency in a short amount of time (although even the mavens I came across had issue with giseigo/giongo production, figure that out).  But don't assume the same technique a maven uses will apply to your everyday person.  I've studied Japanese for going on 14 years now (8 of those years being intense study: masters program, study abroad) and the more that I learn the more that I realize that I don't know.",1334865572
3864802,comment,3862423,3864109,2,0,cluda01,,,"I'm not sure if this is possible. According to Wolfram Alpha the distance between NYC and Tokyo is ~10879 Kilometers (as the crow flies, not as the cable lies). The speed of light in Kilometers per second is 299,792.458<p>If we evaluate (10879 / 299792.458) * 1000 = 36.28. This is for a single leg. So we get 72.57 milliseconds just for as the crow flies transport. This does not include other factors that contribute to latency (network, processing, etc.)<p>For ""round trip"" as you say then this number should be multiplied by 2 as it has to go NYC -> Tokyo, Tokyo -> NYC.<p>Have you developed some sort of faster than the speed of light communication mechanism we haven't heard of? Inquiring minds demand to know.<p>Edit:\nOne possible explanation is that you are using multiple time sources that are not synchronized. E.g. if you send a FIX message to an ECN and use the clock available on your machine and then use the ECN's timestamps somewhere in your calculation this renders the measurement invalid because you can't ensure that your clocks are synchronized.",1334865538

In addition to practical use as an emulator, it might make a good learning tool for someone who wants to understand how the Atari VCS's weird hardware works. Perhaps read along with the canonical Stella Programmer's Guide (<a href=""http://www.alienbill.com/2600/101/docs/stella.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alienbill.com/2600/101/docs/stella.html</a>) and the less technical but still informative book <i>Racing the Beam</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026201257X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kmjn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=026201257X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026201257X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?...</a>).<p>A minor quibble is that the audio emulation, while accurate from the perspective of what the audio hardware does, produces a bunch of harsh-sounding aliasing when used to generate digital audio. That's a common problem with 8-bit emulators, though. The short explanation of why: in the hardware implementation, the Atari feeds square waves directly into speakers. Square waves are in a sense the ""natural"" electrical signal for digital circuits, and from simple bit-patterns you can get complex harmonics. But when, instead of feeding them as voltages directly to a speaker, you generate digital audio samples that look like square waves, the harmonics above the Nyquist frequency (1/2 the sample rate) fold over into the audible range as aliasing artifacts.<p>The fix is to generate band-limited square waves, which are approximations to square waves w/ no frequency content above the Nyquist frequency. There's an active research literature on how to best do that efficiently (it's important if you're trying to digitally replicate the sound of classic analog synths like the Moog), but it mostly boils down to replacing the discontinuity in the square wave (which is where the harmonics come from) with something more like a ripple, designed to only produce sub-Nyquist harmonics. One fairly simple approach, integrated into several emulators, is explained here (w/code): <a href=""http://www.slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/</a>",1334865302
3864784,comment,3864043,3864455,6,0,mdaniel,,,"I bought all 5 levels of Rosetta French version 3, and I lambast it at every opportunity.<p>There is one positive item, one huge negative and one poor implementation point.<p>The positive is that I think the mechanism, or put another way the Rosetta Stone platform, is mostly good. The combination of visual and aural, with a relatively simple screen-is-one-concept approach, is good.<p>The negative for me was the actual <i>content</i> itself. I learned about ladders, and horses and crazy things that not once have I encountered here in Paris. It would have been helpful to learn food items, grocery store items, things folks (even tourists) would likely find useful.<p>I hesitate to mention this because it might not have been a Rosetta Stone objective, nor might it fit into their framework/platform. But, there were no verb tense lessons. Even just rote learning of ""je voudrais ..."" [I would like ...] would get you out of 80% of the conversational jams when trying to get a sandwich, or similar.<p>The poor implementation point is that I did not experience any good luck using their voice recognition engine. Perhaps it is because I really have horrible French pronunciation. However, isn't that the very situation Rosetta is trying to correct? I found no way to discover <i>why</i> it was upset with my pronunciation. It was just a very frustration experience.",1334865276

They're either in the infantry or police phase now. Basically they're not concerned with gaining new territory. They're most concerned with defending their current position.<p>This is a problem every incumbent faces when they grow sufficiently large. Microsoft's decisions of the last 15 years have been borne of a fear that something will kill the Windows/Office golden goose.<p>The ultimate evolution of this defensive strategy is for a company to launch a conflagration of litigation, often with a new CEO, in a last-ditch effort to squeeze out some value. You saw it with SCO. You see it with Yahoo.<p>Defense is a short-term strategy. At the point you stop innovating you've already begun to die. It may take awhile. Billion dollar companies don't die overnight (although Groupon may prove me wrong). Yahoo has been dying a slow death for years.<p>I would gladly pay a (reasonable) monthly fee just for HBO. But I'm not going to pay $100+/month for cable and it. I pay for Netflix. At $8/month it may not have all the content but it's enough for me.<p>HBO is now locked in the same death spiral big cable is: big cable doesn't want a la carte cable because people either won't use it if it's too expensive or they'll spend less on cable, neither being a good outcome (for them). HBO needs big cable to distribute their content. My theory is they can't circumvent that without threatening what is their main source of income (big cable won't react well to being cut out of the loop). The risk of that strategy, from their perspective, is simply too high.<p>HBO should be afraid of the rise of the likes of AMC. If they're not careful the next generation of innovators is going to eat them for breakfast.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/06/commandos-infantry-and-police.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/06/commandos-infantry-...</a>",1334863775

3864663,comment,3862166,3864118,8,0,mtts,,,"> I used the GIMP as my primary art asset creation tool for several years. It was miserable.<p>I used the Gimp for < spam > <a href=""http://rommelhok.com/en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rommelhok.com/en</a> < / spam > (48 pages worth of old fashioned adventure comics). Not for the drawing itself, but for the cleaning up, the coloring and the lettering. It was fine.<p>Everything worked without a hitch, once I got used to some new shortcuts (which can easily be set to the Photoshop equivalents if you want) and some minor differences from Photoshop, some of which were, in fact, improvements (the color selection tool is much nicer in Gimp than the color range selection box in Photoshop, for example).<p>The only area where Gimp definitely falls short is type setting. In Photoshop, you can tweak kerning, spacing and font size within a text layer for every character individually. In Gimp, you can only do that for the layer as a whole. This wasn't much of a problem for me, however, since computer lettering is already inferior to hand lettering (IMHO) and using Photoshop's superior tools wouldn't have decreased the suckiness of the lettering all that significantly.<p>The other main shortcoming of Gimp, of course, is that it can't do CMYK colors but that will only become a problem when someone decides to publish my comic, in which case having to redo the colors will be a nice problem to have. I made one printed copy of it for myself at the local copy shop using the RGB Gimp files and that turned out beautifully.",1334863457

Allison will be in Mountain View very shortly, doing some work that I may not be allowed to disclose fully, but can say involves web development and innovation, after having made valuable contacts through her original post. They have expressed interest in funding, since she can show the apps we've received already for a few things, many of which are close to prototype stage. It's hard to say more without her or her backers go ahead.<p>We must start smaller by force of necessity. Just as micro-loans targeted at women have turned around communities in the developing world, we accept that we must start slow before we can fund enormous projects. That said, just helping Allison get pizza one week and agreeing to take on what work I can do in my part of the country helped her move forward with the infrastructure.<p>2. It isn't only sex work, that's just something which disproportionately impacts our community. I like to joke sometimes that if the stereotype reflected reality more fully, it would say transwomen are mostly programmers. We want, in time, to be able to support a purely charitable branch, but right now we look to fund only those who have a real startup plan and some tangible work they can show us.<p>As for whether we can do it in ""good conscience"", neither of us, especially knowing what we can do and what others can do, are interested in giving people ""just enough"" to get by while still living at risk. We'll do charitable works, and I spend a great deal of my personal time in that area, but it's not enough, it doesn't change things. We can do both, but our focus is on startups people actually bring to us (5 so far in talks).<p>2a. Already addressed. We want to help prevent talented and driven people from losing opportunities, and that's the top priority. Allison is one of those. She certainly isn't someone with no skill or education or motivation. The question really is, why take away the hope that comes with believing you can make a difference in your own life by telling someone they shouldn't think about doing better until they get as lucky as many people here already are? With work, meaningful work, comes an anchor and dignity and purpose.<p>3. That's one model, not the only one. See this: <a href=""http://www.grameen-info.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grameen-info.org/</a>\nFurther, it's strange to ask why we're so restricted, when investment funds already are seriously restricted to a fraction of the population. They have the same demands of talent and productivity we have, but discriminate based on what gives the absolute highest return, and in many cases sadly, discriminate based on the immutable characteristics of the person applying for the loan or funding. Those are two restrictions we do not have.<p>Someone I know once made a video diary app in her spare time, no funding. It wasn't unique, had no functionality other apps lacked, wasn't even user friendly, and she doesn't even support it. The app still makes her several hundred a month, and she made it purely as an experiment in her spare time. We don't want to fund poor projects that aren't supported, but that's an example of how we don't have to give up because we can't leap straight to the billion dollar idea.",1334862580

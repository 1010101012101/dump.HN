As such, this book talks about algorithms for clustering, classification, feature identification, collaborative filtering, etc., none of which are really addressed in depth in AIMA. There is a relatively brief section on learning techniques in AIMA, but it doesn't go into much depth, and is more focused on reinforcement learning than on typical data mining techniques (automatic classification, clustering, etc.)",1188085557

""Web 2.0"" actually has a lot of deep technology to it; I think ""harnessing human intelligence"" is a technical trend that will continue for decades. The hard part is figuring out unique, useful ways of algorithmically working with user generated data, which in turn would lead to new categories of applications.",1188084966

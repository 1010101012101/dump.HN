6935643,comment,6928230,6931115,1,0,dkokelley,,,"I apologize for the late reply.<p>The truth is some jobs are simply not worth much to the employer. The minimum wage laws generally are designed to ensure a livable (albeit uncomfortable) income for a single adult working full time. In California, the minimum wage is $8/hr, and scheduled to increase to $10/hr within a couple years. This combined with government assistance programs will generally ensure that individuals with the will to work can afford to live near their livelihood ($500/month room with utilities in the bay area with BART access <a href=\"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/4250779898.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/4250779898.html</a>). Of course there are several other factors that impact one&#x27;s ability to sustain themselves:<p>Dependants - There is government assistance available for dependant children.<p>Lack of work - The man from this article does not work full time. The availability of full-time jobs aside, it is not reasonable to expect a livable income on part time, unskilled work.<p>Major unplanned expenses - Things such as unplanned medical expenses or enormous college tuitions or loan repayments will be a burden to someone making minimum wage.<p>My point is, 1) I do not accept the assumption that certain jobs are non-livable by definition. For an individual working full time without dependants or edge-case financial burdens, you can generally get by in America. 2) &quot;non-livable&quot; jobs only exist when certain edge case financial hardships arise. In general, assistance is available in these cases, and we have systems in place to support people who fall on hard times. Whether these systems are working as intended is beyond the scope of employee compensation, although there is definitely a case for improving these systems.<p>There is a third, unspoken point about &quot;non-livable&quot; jobs. People who work these jobs are usually not expected to stay very long. Sometimes these are &quot;stepping-stone&quot; opportunities for the young and inexperienced. Other times these jobs act as a safety net for workers who have lost their higher-paying jobs and need to survive until they can be fully employed. I accept there are people who have no plans or hopes of moving on from these jobs, either due to a lack of marketable skills or even language barriers. I don&#x27;t believe the answer is in regulating these jobs to pay better. I think the answer lies in educational outreach. Instead of bettering the job, let&#x27;s try to better the individual so they can get a better job.<p>Finally, I agree that &quot;someone has to do these things&quot;. The market will ensure that the things that need to get done are done. Assuming that everyone &quot;gets better jobs&quot;, the supply of unskilled laborers will decrease. From economics, I would guess that a lack of supply for certain menial tasks will have one of two outcomes: the price for the menial task will increase (&quot;non-livable&quot; jobs now become more livable), or a substitute will eliminate the need for the work (automation).",1387470777

The proponents of this filter have opened the door to this line of argument wide open by making that argument while ignoring that the filter <i>also</i> is likely to harm the groups they claim they want to help.

If the people arguing for this filter are serious about the <i>intent</i> of protecting children (which I must admit I don&#x27;t think they are), then they need to be confronted with the reality that they may be doing harm to the very weakest part of the group they claim to want to protect.<p>If the filter only affected the person opting in/out of it, I wouldn&#x27;t see it as a big deal - in that case it would not remove freedoms from anyone.<p>But the most compelling immediate problem with this filter for me is exactly that it effectively takes the choice of having unfiltered internet away from a large group of people that are often vulnerable.

I would write a tool that would attempt to translate between the two automatically, and then any more complex transformations could be hand coded and/or added to the translation engine.<p>Of course, the project did not succeed during my time at the company, mostly because the scope of the translator was so limited; there were too many concepts in AS2 (the borrowed javascript setInterval, for example) that had no equivalent line-for-line in AS3 (where you had to use the new Timer class to delay/loop execution) and therefore couldn&#x27;t be simply substituted. Perhaps if the parser had tried to represent higher order concepts than files and lines of code (e.g. classes, instance data, methods) the project would have got further - but we simply didn&#x27;t have the resource to spend on it, nor the ability to freeze features on the AS2 codebase.<p>As it was, the AS3 version of the app never quite reached feature parity with the AS2 version, which raced ahead too quickly for the new features to be added by hand in AS3 (and too many changes had already been made by hand to make re-running the parser viable.)<p>If Go is indeed simple enough to translate into from (a specific subset of) C, and if Google can afford more than one engineer for a week to write the tool, then this sounds like it&#x27;s off to a better start than my project was.",1387470500

RNs (registered nurses) earn an average salary of about $112,000 a year.  Application developers, on the other hand, earn about $111,000 a year.<p><a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/gettowork/2013/12/17/what-the-most-common-jobs-in-san-francisco-pay/#18915101=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.sfgate.com/gettowork/2013/12/17/what-the-most-co...</a><p>Interestingly, physicians and pharmacists aren&#x27;t listed (perhaps there aren&#x27;t enough of them to make the list).  Laywers, in spite of recent issues in the legal world, are still listed as having an average salary of $166,000 a year in San Francisco.<p>Nursing is 90% women.  Pharmacy is about 56% women.  At UCSF, the entering medical school class is 58% women.  At Boalt law school (UC Berkeley), the entering class is 54% women.<p>Average don&#x27;t tell the whole story.  There&#x27;s good and bad in everything.  Many lawyers give up, so there is some survivor bias here (though you could certainly say the same thing about developers - many people believe firmly that there is bad age bias after age 40, something that doesn&#x27;t appear to happen in health fields).<p>In terms of career stability and earnings, long term, I actually think that all of the fields (except perhaps law) listed above are probably better choices for academically talented students.<p>I post this a lot, but here it is again - the RAND institute concluded that the american aversion to graduate degrees in STEM fields is rational and market driven, a response to poor prospects and pay <i>relative</i> to the options available high achieving students in other fields.<p><a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>We should at least consider the possibility that avoidance of STEM degrees and software development careers may actually reflect better career decision making.  We say that young women are generally outperforming young men academically, <i>but</i> not in STEM.  Well, maybe avoidance of STEM is just another manifestation of how women are making better choices in life than men are.",1387470492

It makes sense that you might need different rules for acceptable treatment of enemy combatants when you&#x27;re in combat, when you don&#x27;t have the luxury of time and calm deliberation that a court affords because people are shooting at each other. But to me, the appropriate response to recent &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks is to treat them exactly like any other threat, assault or murder, and to put suspects/perpetrators through exactly the same legal processes as anyone else. It is disturbing that we are even considering the possibility that someone who isn&#x27;t accused of any violent crime at all might have to worry about being labelled an enemy combatant and thus forfeit their normal legal right to due process.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dc/2013/04/king-mccain-graham-ayotte-want-enemy-combatant-status-for-boston-suspect\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dc/2013/04/king-mccain-grah...</a>",1387470421

Some people like that as a way of enforcing consistency. That will have some possibly confusing effects on Android apps running in Myriad&#x27;s compatibility environment. Also, the last time I looked at Myriad&#x27;s technology, they were using their own Java VM, which means, at least,some kind of Dalvik to Java bytecode converter for apps as they are installed, or an SDK plugin to produce &quot;Myriad-VM-ready&quot; apps.<p>It looks pretty clean. It should appeal to the people who were buying Nokia&#x27;s Harmattan and Meego devices. If Jolla can pick up a majority of the Qt apps that had been developed for those platforms and grow that developer community, they may have a chance.<p>It will take at least a year, and probably some more hardware to tell where Jolla is going and if it will be successful.

6935412,comment,6934352,6934934,12,0,jcampbell1,,,"> I&#x27;m disappointed about the Android market, I hope it improves.<p>Based on some research that I have done, iOS revenue is about 2:1 for phone apps, with the gap closing quickly.  If the app has strong international appeal, it is probably closer to parity.  For tablet apps, iOS has something like a 10:1 revenue advantage.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t write off Android if the app is designed to be used on phones, but for tablet apps, it is currently a waste of time for most indie devs.<p>That being said, this type of software is completely evergreen.  You can&#x27;t reach saturation because there are always new kids and new parents searching for apps.  It is conceivable you could launch an Android app, make $10k this year, but then the app earns $100k five years from now.<p>The bigger problem is other devs poisoning the well with high quality free apps.  Which is why I believe this type of post is a mistake if maximizing income is your priority.  This type of post is an invitation for talentless hacks to hire people from elance to clone your app.  All it takes is someone to figure out how to game the app store rankings better than you.  I could probably pay $40k to clone an app, with the twist that modules are unlocked if you rate the app, and then out rank Pierre&#x27;s apps.",1387468865

Is there much advantage to that over allowing the variable to be accessed directly?<p>Oh my yes. As soon as you need more than one processor messing with an object they are invaluable. The only thing better is immutable objects.<p>It&#x27;s also nice to have the object interface separate from object data if you want to change the object data representation without breaking everything (I don&#x27;t know in general when you would do this, I just know I have done it before and getter/setters let me work faster to refactor).",1387468862

I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the only who did a double take when the Melbourne man, who we were led to believe completed the project, simply asked people for money and then hired a teen in Eastern Europe with peanuts to build the thing.

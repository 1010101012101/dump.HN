It is extraordinarily doubtful that Microsoft would go all in on x86 like that, and it would be somewhat archaic if they did.<p>I would surmise that Microsoft is speaking from a development/management perspective. If WinRT had all of the APIs available in Win32/64, for instance, whether it&#x27;s ARM or MIPS or AMD64 shouldn&#x27;t really matter that much for cross-targeting apps like Office (which I doubt has much assembly in it): If the compiler supports it, it&#x27;s an option.<p>And from an internal perspective we know from a post yesterday that they laid off a Windows test engineer, probably because their plan going forward is that the major services (and obviously teams) of all of the platforms combine, which makes a lot of sense.

8074020,comment,8073748,8073748,42,0,tokenadult,,,"Articles about issues like this have been submitted several times to Hacker News, and I&#x27;m glad to see that this article is getting some discussion. Right after I saw the submission here, I looked up articles on the replication problem in psychology, and I came back to the PsychFileDrawer.org top 20 list of studies that are nominated as needing more replication.[1] I&#x27;d like to see more replication of several of those studies myself.<p>Another recent commentary that I don&#x27;t recall seeing submitted to Hacker News is &quot;Psychology&#x27;s real replication problem: our Methods sections,&quot;[2] which suggests (quite plausibly to me) that many publications in psychology journals describe the methods of the study so inadequately that it is hard to know whether or not the study can be replicated.<p>A scholar of how scientific research is conducted and of statistical errors that show up in many peer-reviewed scientific publications,  Uri Simonsohn, has a whole website about &quot;p-hacking&quot; and how to detect it.[3] Simonsohn is a professor of psychology with a better than average understanding of statistics. He and his colleagues are concerned about making scientific papers more reliable. You can use the p-curve software on that site for your own investigations into p values found in published research. Many of the interesting issues brought up by comments on the article kindly submitted here become much more clear after reading Simonsohn&#x27;s various articles[4] about p values and what they mean, and other aspects of interpreting published scientific research. And I think Hacker News readers who have thought deeply about statistics will be delighted by the sense of humor while making pointed remarks about experimental methods that you can find in the papers of Simonsohn and his colleagues.<p>Simonsohn provides an abstract (which links to a full, free download of a funny, thought-provoking paper)[5] with a &quot;twenty-one word solution&quot; to some of the practices most likely to make psychology research papers unreliable. He also has a paper posted on evaluating replication results[6] with more specific tips on that issue.<p>&quot;Abstract: &quot;When does a replication attempt fail? The most common standard is: when it obtains p > .05. I begin here by evaluating this standard in the context of three published replication attempts, involving investigations of the embodiment of morality, the endowment effect, and weather effects on life satisfaction, concluding the standard has unacceptable problems. I then describe similarly unacceptable problems associated with standards that rely on effect-size comparisons between original and replication results. Finally, I propose a new standard: Replication attempts fail when their results indicate that the effect, if it exists at all, is too small to have been detected by the original study. This new standard (1) circumvents the problems associated with existing standards, (2) arrives at intuitively compelling interpretations of existing replication results, and (3) suggests a simple sample size requirement for replication attempts: 2.5 times the original sample.&quot;<p>I should add that slamming the entire discipline of psychology as a discipline with sloppy methodology goes a bit too far. I have learned about most of the publications that take psychology most to task from working psychology researchers. There are whole departments of psychology[7] that largely have a scientific orientation and are trying to improve the discipline&#x27;s methodology. Crap psychology abounds, but it is gradually being displaced by science-based psychology based on sound methodologies. It is of course more methodologically difficult to study the behavior of our fellow human beings than to study clouds or volcanoes or insects, but many scientifically oriented psychologists are working on the problem with good methods and sound statistical analysis. Some thoughtful psychologists have been prompted to stress careful replication by the failed studies that have come before.[8]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psychfiledrawer.org/top-20/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychfiledrawer.org/top-20/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://psychsciencenotes.blogspot.com/2014/05/psychologys-real-replication-problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychsciencenotes.blogspot.com/2014/05/psychologys-re...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.p-curve.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.p-curve.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2160588"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2160588</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2259879"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2259879</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/research/areas/pib/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/research/areas/pib/</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2012/february-12/psychologys-woes-and-a-partial-cure-the-value-of-replication.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/o...</a>",1406119366

I&#x27;ve worked with developers who I greatly respect who are obsessive about code comments.  I&#x27;ve even been told that the comments are more important than the code and in that specific context it made sense.<p>But my own experience and biases make me think code comments are a problem.  I like to refer to them as future lies.  There is virtually no back pressure on comments to keep them in sync with the code.  There is no automated way to verify them and refactoring tools on comments are rudimentary at best. To put it simply, I no longer trust comments and will usually ignore them in order to verify the code itself.  I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve found comments that directly contradicted the code it was commenting.  It isn&#x27;t even uncommon to find comments that are incorrect when they are written!<p>As to the folks recommending comments that document the &quot;why&quot; of a piece of code, I&#x27;d counter that if you have a &quot;why&quot; you have a specification.  If you have a specification it should be verified in a systematic way.  So performance improvements, or specific client requirements should be encoded in tests so that they don&#x27;t regress.  Comments do not provide that safety.<p>That&#x27;s not to say I never comment my code.  Just that it always feels like a failure when I do.  It is usually because it is cheaper to comment than to provide cleaner code or better verified specifications.",1406118361

My program is the world and none have dominion over any of the rest of it and any other conception of reality is wrong.  (And edited to add I&#x27;ve gotten involved in some weird &quot;EE&quot; stuff and like it or not, the world itself is plain old weird and illogical sometimes and if you don&#x27;t like that, a computer programmer can&#x27;t fix it, only a physicist, or maybe a diety.  This isn&#x27;t a big problem in the world of CRUD apps but it does happen)<p>Assume comments only exist as a inspirational descriptional prose tool.  Sometimes I use them as placeholders for something I know belongs there but either I or the business are not ready.  Sometimes I use them as a cheatsheet because I&#x27;m personally really uncomfortable.  Sometimes I use them as an outline more like names on a map to orient myself than a travelogue.<p>Assume all programmers fit the management ideal of identical replacable cogs.  &quot;How could someone work here without knowing by heart how to convert dBmW into volts or the difference between S21 and S12 microwave scattering parameters, so I have no need to comment this, but I&#x27;ve never actually used this corner of matrix math while employed before so I&#x27;ll make one of those laughable comments that is a simple linear translation just to help me keep my head on straight.<p>Assume comments go thru the same code review process as code.  If a comment in file A tangentially relates to function Q in file B, and you modify function Q, your code review process will probably examine file B and the comments in it, but how do you ensure file A gets modified?  This is especially bad with those &quot;because&quot; style comments. (edited to add, at least date your comments?)<p>Assume no metrics exist WRT comments to be gamed.  Your continued employment and possible promotion exist because of a content free meaningless metric number, perhaps lines of comments.  Ask a professional to generate a number, you&#x27;ll get a nice number, but unprofessional work.  Ask a professional to do professional work, and you get professional results and who cares what the number is.  That requires a high caliber of management, usually unavailable.  Even worse a low caliber of management, the kind most likely to demand adherence to meaningless metrics, is also exactly the type least likely to successfully evaluate the professionalism of the code so they don&#x27;t end up with good code.  So you get meaningless metrics resulting in meaningless comments right next to bad code, if you enforce metrics.<p>Assume there exists a silver bullet for comments, just like this months silver bullet fad for code also fixes all problems.<p>(edited to add) Assume there&#x27;s one human language.  I worked at a place where outsourcing and H1B took complete control over corporate IT such that code comments and even some internal documents were no longer written in English.

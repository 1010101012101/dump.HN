The trend is especially pronounced with mobile devices, as mobile usage peaks on the weekend and includes a much longer average session length than we see on the desktop.",1409309994

The accuracy of the GPS system depends on tracking down and eliminating every possible source of error, and to maximize position accuracy, two relativistic effects are accounted for:<p>1. The time dilation caused by the satellites&#x27; velocity, from Special Relativity.<p>2. The rate of time passage at orbital altitude compared to that at the surface, which reflects the gravitational well effect of General Relativity.<p>The two effects move in opposite directions, but they don&#x27;t cancel out. The applied correction (to the orbiting clocks) is very small indeed, but enough to avoid a gradual but serious decline in positional accuracy over time.",1409309572

But I think it behooves us to be a little more critical in our choice of critics.<p>This struck me when the author, in his introduction, mentioned a previous Q&A with telepathy proponent Rupert Sheldrake. Sheldrake only gets a brief mention in this piece as a critic of science, and I hasten to add that I don&#x27;t have any beef with the article from that point on.<p>For anyone who doesn&#x27;t know, Sheldrake has for years been trying to convince people that telepathy is real. To this end, he&#x27;s done a series of experiments which had the kind of inconclusive results you&#x27;d expect, yet in spite of a dearth of convincing, published results, in spite of a global failure to replicate his results, he keeps badgering science to take him seriously. Having been met with apathy and mild derision, he now blames science on his failure to be taken seriously.<p>So yes, Sheldrake is a &quot;science critic.&quot; So are many of the purveyors of homeopathy, of miracle cancer cures, of coffee enemas, of dowsing and of Intelligent Design. Science is empirical, and people without evidence like to call this a shortcoming of science.<p>So my question is: how much debunking, how much finger pointing and pantsless emperors is required before we can in good conscience exclude certain groups of people from discussions about the philosophy of science? Those discussions are important, no doubt - and this is why I think we should be wary of allowing them to be bogged down by the contributions of frauds and crackpots.",1409308252

As it is, even if a field perfusion is not performed, cardiopulmonary support plus gradual cooling still massively reduce any chance of brain damage.<p>A standby is when they wait at your deathbed with a doctor, then get to work as soon as you are pronounced dead, including using a machine to perform cardiopulmonary support to circulate oxygen to the brain while cooling. They then start perfusion (replacement of blood with cryoprotectant), normally in the field.<p>Cryonics as assisted suicide would be preferable as an option, but a standby is significantly better than nothing. As it is, several US states have legalised assisted suicide, so it could potentially become an option in those states, but I guess nobody wants the mess of the legal battle to set a precedent. If there was a Swiss cryonics company, it would probably be available as assisted suicide today.<p>See also my other comment on assisted suicide: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8241828"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8241828</a>",1409306712

Let's say FatFrog is the acquirer and BuzzFly is the acquired.<p>BuzzFly's founders usually have earnouts (""golden handcuffs"") and thus have an incentive to stay, but merging them with FatFrog's executive hierarchy is difficult and rocky. They tend to be resented, especially if there's an age difference (i.e. the BuzzFly founders are 25 and FatFrog execs are 40+). The executive merging is difficult in acq-hires because no one will take orders from a 26-year-old whose IUsedThisToilet virtual bathroom graffiti app just got bought for $87 million.<p>BuzzFly's top programmers, who are by this point the vitality of the organization, don't have the huge amounts of stock that would be incentive to stay. Their company also just got acquired so this is a <i>great</i> time to go for a major external promotion, especially since titles in a soon-to-be-eaten company are pretty easy to self-upgrade.

Hence the difficulty in negotiating changes to employment agreements: rather than a situation where, e.g. a representative of the company and a representative of the employees get together to negotiate things like non-compete terms, a representative of the company, which has worked out a coordinated strategy, is sitting down with an individual who isn't coordinating with anyone.<p>The union analogue of a group of companies, representing a large sector of an industry, coordinating with each other, would be more like the old-school industry-wide unions, which would present demands to employers as a unified front, and simultaneously go on strike from <i>all</i> the employers in the entire sector if their demands weren't met.

If anything, they should be looking to the far more complementary game industry.  Exclusive games would translate directly into iPhone and iPad sales (ie their main profit centers!) in a way that's hard to imagine with movies.  An acquisition or exclusivity deal with the increasingly desperate Nintendo would be money well spent.<p>I'll be surprised if there aren't a round of game company acquisitions to this effect in the next few years for exactly this purpose, as blue chip game makers struggle to compete with increasingly rich $3 smartphone apps, and as games are the main beneficiary of increasing smartphone power.  Microsoft understands the value of a well timed acquisition (buying Bungie basically made the XBox an instant success), so I wouldn't be surprise if they initiate.",1327676777

I got my giant cup of coffee and watched the sunrise from the fire escape. As a designer mind, I found a unique sense of comfort in watching the morning unfold. From foggy, cool, quiet streets to warm(er), busy streets in under an hour. The colors, the sounds, and the smells are refreshing and inspiring.<p>I can honestly say that I've had some of the most lucid moments of my entire life the past few mornings. If you haven't given waking up early a fair shot, you definitely should. Of course, I doubt it's right for everyone.

Both of these can be discussed with all 3 of you to make sure they do not become a problem later.<p>The first risk: when you are making money from consultancy, building the startup becomes easy to ignore. You might think ""I could code today and earn nothing, or I could charge customers today and make real money"". In 1 year you might all be running a small consultancy business making OK money, but not having done much on your startup idea.<p>The second risk: What if 1 of you works more on the startup than the others? Maybe you agree to share the consultancy money three ways - but that can feel unfair if two people are bringing in money while the third only does the startup. Or maybe one of you decides to do the consultancy only - what happens if the startup becomes really big just after they leave?<p>So there is no reason not to do the consultancy to bring in money while you build the startup. Just be aware of the risks and discuss them together (and write down any decisions, in case you need that later). Good luck!",1327676569

I checked my mirror again a second later, he hadn't gotten any closer.  I thought this odd, but continued in the left lane - the right lane was packed, and he was still a solid ten or fifteen car lengths behind me.  After a minute of this I found a three car length gap in the right lane, and pulled over anyway.  He was past in a flash.  Canadian plates.

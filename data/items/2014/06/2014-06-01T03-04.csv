I had the chance to meet Brewster and many others whilst last in San Francisco and their passion is infectious.\nIf anyone is interested, they have an open lunch on Fridays[1] where you get to see the church, the tech, and meet the team. Each team member and guest gives a few sentences about who they are and what they do, which really gives you a feel to how much work is going on under the covers.<p>I feel humanity will look back on this period -- lost diskettes, CDs, DVDs, game consoles, Betamax, VHS -- and lament the comparative black hole of information. Myspace history deleted with no warning, Justin.tv deleting history with only 8 days warning[2], ... and a million more examples.

7828118,comment,7826633,7826633,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this to be honest. On one hand I can see the benefits of reduced costs. Why fly up a helicopter if a drone can be used in its place? Why send police to patrol high-crime areas if a drone can do that much more safely without any casualties?<p>Then there are the downsides.<p>> The LAPD is not the military. With these new tools at their disposal, the police could use drones to overstep their boundaries as police.<p>> If the drones are equipped with any kind of tactical ability (firing ammunition or firing a taser) this could result in innocent civilians being targeted by drone strikes.<p>> Drones would allow for extremely affordable surveillance which in turn would mean the fears of a state becoming a surveillance state (even worse than it is now) would be realised.<p>> Regulation. Who is going to regulate the use of drones by the LAPD? Who decides what the purpose of a drone being used for is and are there processes in place to prevent abuse? Who regulates the regulator?<p>> Remember what happened when SWAT teams were introduced? They were meant to be for only serious crimes and then look what happened. Before we knew it, SWAT teams were being deployed at relatively peaceful protests, they were being used to evict people out of their foreclosed homes and they started being used on people accused of copyright infringement. Are we going to see something similar to that of the Kent State shooting in the 70&#x27;s only this time drones will be used?<p>I think the downsides far outweigh the benefits. The police are becoming far too militarised for my liking. Although many refute these claims, you only have to look at what tools police have at their disposal nowadays compared to what they had 20 years ago. We&#x27;ve gone from cars and pistols to high-powered machine guns with heavy rounds and tank-like vehicles.",1401595114

Choosing or coming up with the logic to treat a situation is <i>exactly</i> what you&#x27;d be doing.<p>It&#x27;s also particularly good at illuminating the underlying structure of different domains and giving you tools to recognize similarities between them that may not be readily apparent. This goes well beyond what most non-mathematicians regard as &quot;mathematically accessible&quot;: just look at all the various modal logics[1] both for the breadth of their applications (belief, knowledge, time...) and their internal similarities.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic</a><p>Moreover, I would argue that mathematics goes further than most fields in talking about and working with its own limitations. Metamathematics and logic as fields are all about this—with greater clarity than the fuzzier subjects, in the usual mathematical style. Mathematics is also great for consistently and rationally accounting for uncertainty and limitations of other systems, fundamental to probability and any sane treatment of risk.<p>Mathematics, as practiced by mathematicians, also teaches another really important idea: having <i>different</i> levels of rigor, as appropriate. Often, an argument only needs to be convincing, and many of the important details can be left out. However, in math, this is always done with the understanding that those details <i>can be</i> filled in, and the understanding that <i>you</i> should be able to fill them in given enough time.<p>I figure the focus on clarity, thorough introspection and different levels of rigor, abstractions and logic all make mathematics <i>qua</i> mathematics one of the ultimate &quot;humanities&quot;. The problem is that classes for non-majors (and, perhaps, many undergraduate classes <i>for</i> majors) often don&#x27;t teach mathematics for itself; instead, they teach mathematics as a tool for engineering or solving specific problems or getting a specific result. And that, certainly, could be fairly described as &quot;data analysis within a framework&quot;.<p>But mathematics in general? Much deeper!",1401595039

Both the 2009 and 2010 bombings were disrupted only by luck, so &quot;clearly&quot; the NSA didn&#x27;t have the tools they needed, which is why I warn you guys that the argument &quot;oh but they didn&#x27;t catch Tsarnaev&quot; doesn&#x27;t end the way you think it does. :P<p>----<p>I know you all like to claim that counter-terrorism is just rhetoric used to justify more sinister motives, but I&#x27;ve found it striking how almost every time a leak is presented the evidence shows a bunch of NSA analysts trumpeting... counter-terrorism.<p>This case is no different: &quot;another 2011 N.S.A. document reported that a facial recognition system was queried with a photograph of Osama bin Laden.&quot;, &quot;A 2011 PowerPoint showed one example when Tundra Freeze, the N.S.A.’s main in-house facial recognition program, was asked to identify photos matching the image of a bearded young man with dark hair.&quot;, &quot;One N.S.A. PowerPoint presentation from 2011, for example, displays several photographs of an unidentified man — sometimes bearded, other times clean-shaven — in different settings, along with more than two dozen data points about him. These include whether he was on the <i>Transportation Security Administration no-fly list</i>, his <i>passport and visa status</i>, <i>known associates</i> or <i>suspected terrorist ties</i>, and <i>comments made about him by informants to American intelligence agencies</i>.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s certainly an argument to be made about whether such investigative abilities are safe for democracy, but what we&#x27;ve consistently not seen is a bunch of people trying to subvert democracy, not even according to the very documents NSA and their managers thought would be safest from ever being publically disclosed.",1401592234

My point is that those should mirror quite nicely the running costs of Wikipedia, since neither has &quot;headcount cost&quot; attached to each visitor. Both are mostly just serving static text on a website, and neither are paying royalty or click-throughs to third-parties based on visitor count.<p>In revenue, Wikipedia has donations and TPB has ads. Asking which revenue is bigger is very different from calculating costs. TPB might earn more revenue, but to figure that out one has to calculate the competitive price of advertise space for infamous websites. My guess is that the competitive price is quite low, sine few companies are willing to send untraceable money in order to advertise on a website that many companies and governments consider criminal.<p>So for revenue, I would look into what botnet spam and hijacked webservers brings in per eyeball. Multiply that with the visitor count of TPB, minus the running cost, and you should get a rather realistic number for the sites total income.",1401591826

It is simply a measure of wealth, not a desired outcome for obvious reasons.<p>Just because level 4 affords you jets does not mean everyone should aspire to buy a jet. Again it is mentioned as a reference of what you could attain at that level.<p>In America in my view, amassing $5 million gets you to level 2. The figure could be argued and it fully depends on your style and standard of living. So for you it might be significantly less or perhaps much more. This figure assumes a monthly spend of $20K and a paid off house (paid out of the $5m)",1401591725

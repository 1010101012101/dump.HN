I might be convinced to give you this one but really reading the perl code isn't that difficult even with 3 extra symbols to know.

Same thing goes for perl. The perl code you show above is perfectly readable. Unless does exactly what you expect it to. -> arrows mean exactly what you would expect them to. Arrays start at 0 exactly like most programmers expect them to. and on top of that its readable.

844413,comment,843512,844293,0,0,EliAndrewC,,,"My main problem with Perl is references and contexts.  Most of the experienced programmers I work with find themselves unable to write or debug code that requires the use of these Perl concepts.<p>For example, my co-workers and I find it easy and intuitive to work with lists in Python<p><pre><code>    xs = [5, 6]
    xs.append(7)
    print xs[2]     # prints 7
    xs.append([])   # easy to append lists to other lists
    xs[3].append(6) # easy to append to the inner list
    some_func(12, ""hello"", xs, True) # easy to pass to a function
</code></pre>
In Perl this would be way more complicated for reasons that are obvious to someone who knows Perl well, but a mystery to people who use Perl casually.<p><pre><code>    $xs = [5, 6];       # must be a reference
    push @$xs, 7        # deference $xs as a list
    print ""$xs->[2]\n""  # still not too bad
    push @$xs, []       # add a nested list reference
    push @{$xs->[3]}, 6 # omgwtf?!
    some_func(12, ""hello"", $xs, 1) # not too bad
</code></pre>
Understanding ""push @{$xs->[3]}, 6"" is asking a lot just to deal with a nested list that you need to pass to a function, especially compared to the easily understandable ""xs[3].append(6)"".  For that matter, it's asking a lot to make you understand the difference between a list and a list reference.  It's asking a lot to ask to understand the concept of ""evaluating in a ___ context"", especially when other languages manage to do the same things without these concepts.",1253913431

It has gained a reputation of being a great framework for writing hello world in 60 seconds, but not for building real business applications. Sails is a great tool, but unfortunately is dying, as evidenced by the attitude of the creators (who have moved on to work on other things), and the multiple articles on hackernews and elsewhere discussing whether it is dying. That answer, obviously, is yes.<p>It is for these reasons that we (several of the core Sails.js maintainers) decided to invest in building a new framework, where we could offer a Sails-like development experience using modern node.js tools and design practices.

A single ATM of pressure is easy to leak, and your body is undergoing some real nasty expansion problems; As the sibling commenter notes, too, holding your breath is likely dangerous, as your internal chest cavity may not be able to apply enough compressive force to hold the air in. (And microscopically your lung will try to inflate excessively, leading to internal bleeding, I think.)<p>There&#x27;s a really cool idea for a spacesuit that&#x27;s basically just a fabric wet suit that&#x27;s just <i>really</i> compressive (via electromuscles or cinched bands or w/e). That way your body gets the ability to hold onto the gas in your lungs without the risk of your lungs attempting to expand out your gut and throat.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea though: what if you could train your abdomen and chest to compress a lung full of air in a vacuum? Then you just gotta keep your mouth and nose shut somehow. (It&#x27;d be really difficult - it&#x27;d take a force like trying to inflate a car tire with your mouth.

So if you&#x27;re keen on understanding the intellectual currents of education in your piece of the world, it&#x27;s wise to keep abreast of the currents in the US: they will show up in your fine part of the world in time. I&#x27;d guess in these days, the time between &#x27;major American idea&#x27;  and &#x27;hits the rest of the world&#x27; is under a year, if not under a month.<p>I am not sure how distant the third and fourth tier Canadian schools are from the US paradigm, or how independent they feel. I&#x27;d guess they follow the lead of American universities pretty closely.<p>I am super comfortable saying that many UK academics have been lamenting the same thing for the past decade and more; I used to belong to an online academic community with many UK members (also in the Classics) in the 2004-2008 timeframe where the song was being sung with a different verse (but same chorus). If the UK and the US are singing a song; Canada, Australia, and the rest of the English speaking world aren&#x27;t going to be far behind.<p>Particularly in the Anglophone world (I can&#x27;t speak to the others, I am sorry), ideas are shared very fast, and often the US is granted leadership, whether it should be or not. Having been deeply involved in the US university system, I would regard a great deal of the modern innovations in the universities to be a tremendous waste of non-intellectual effort, in <i>many</i> cases for the purposes of boosting the support staff (Gotta embiggen the headcount kingdom) or for comforting the tender feelings of immature children.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to lay all the blame on the universities; and none of the blame should lay on the student&#x27;s shoulders; those who are older and have the reins of power have driven the cart to the ditch. That the load of the cart fell in is not the fault of the load, but the driver. A great deal of blame sits squarely on the United States electorate&#x27;s shoulders; a non-trivial portion sits on the k-12 policymaker&#x27;s shoulders; and the rest of it can be shuffled off to the flow of history, parents, the media, and the usual human condition.",1451629358

It&#x27;s about value and advancing business objectives.<p>That&#x27;s to say that your citation doesn&#x27;t carry weak perception b/c it mentions removing stuff, but rather b/c it fails to mention the value that created.  A better way of wording it might be something like:<p><i>&quot;improved [site performance, or dev efficiency, or something else] by XYZ% by removing low-use features, without sacrificing revenue or customer satisfaction.&quot;</i><p>... b/c simply removing features (regardless of LOC) used by 10% of a user base, in and of itself, doesn&#x27;t offer any justification or value.

If you wrote a project management system at your previous job, focus on citing the number of hours or projects it tracked, or how it reduced the number of meetings required.

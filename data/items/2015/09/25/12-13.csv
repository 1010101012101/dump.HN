I am sometimes surprised that their phones still function with so much cruft installed, never mind the privacy considerations.</i><p>This is a common misconception (also concerning desktop OS &quot;bloat&quot;).<p>As long as those apps are not running at the same time and competing for CPU resources, they could have 100000 apps installed and no issue at all.<p>Especially with sandboxing and automated resource management in iOS (probably Android too, but not too familiar with it).",1443185964

When I&#x27;m bored, I scroll through my phone to see what&#x27;s new.. usually nothing.  So I do the same on his ... it&#x27;s simply just another source of entertainment (if you can even call it that, normally when there&#x27;s jack sht on tv).<p>If I&#x27;m meeting up with him, he&#x27;ll send me his location on when he&#x27;s being super lazy just put on his tracker to make him easier to find.

It&#x27;s more of a &#x27;what&#x27;s mine is yours and do whatever...&#x27; BUT yes, tracking someone WITHOUT their consent, completely different story ... that&#x27;s NOT right.

However, once Sandstorm reaches a stable release, we fully intend to offer more traditional packaging choices as well.

It didn&#x27;t impress me then and Quirky never really impressed me either.<p>Kluster itself was, well, a cluster* at TED.  They didn&#x27;t really have a good idea or execution, and his team was... well, more interested in taking in the sights than slamming to get the project done (with one exception, but that guy was going to be leaving the company).  It felt like an extended college party rather than a company.<p>Sure, Kaufman started and sold Mophie.  Not sure that puts him in &#x27;visionary founder&#x27; territory, and raising $180m doesn&#x27;t prove anything beyond your ability to raise money.  That&#x27;s a useful skill but clearly not enough.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know Kaufman personally, and only interacted with him at TED, so it&#x27;s possible he&#x27;s actually a visionary.  And all startups come with uncertainty and risk; maybe this wasn&#x27;t an execution problem, maybe the entire idea was never going to work, and it took someone trying it to find out.  Because let&#x27;s be honest, nothing guarantees a startup is going to work.  That&#x27;s sort of the essence of startups.<p>We see those ingredients adding up to a win all the time because of survivorship bias.  So maybe it&#x27;s good we see Quirky fail and talk about it, to remind ourselves that there are no guarantees when you&#x27;re doing something brand new.",1443185934

How do you expect AI to create these simulations? Will it program it itself?

It basically  explores a future in which a person&#x27;s criminal intent (called their crime coefficient) along with other mental attributes (collectively referred to as one&#x27;s psycho pass) is judged  by the Sibyl system - A system that works so well that it acts as judge, jury and executioner with little human input. It explores a lot of questions such as the role of free will and potential for change in such a world. Interestingly lot of people find it hard to lower their crime coefficients  after it &#x27;stabilizes&#x27; to a new high (Like how it becomes easier to commit a crime again after having done it once -  the same judgement the police make in this article). Also like in this article, people who are victims of abuse and crime often find their crime coefficients inevitably rise.<p>Don&#x27;t let the cartoon characters  fool you. IMO The complexity and depth of this series (and a lot of sci-fi anime) far surpasses the likes of minority report and hollywood sci-fi in general.

For example, if you pick a recursive QuickSort implementation (just picked sorting because that&#x27;s a classical verification example) and wanted to verify it in Haskell, you&#x27;ll need to prove much more than equality at each recursive step (or unwind the entire computation and then prove equality, but that&#x27;s not a very convenient proof). Second, most interesting algorithms make use of time and state, so you&#x27;d need to prove past the semantics of the effect monad (STM, threads, whatever), and that also requires much more than simple equality (TLA+ and Esterel use temoporal logic, which is awesome, and <i>I think</i> Coq et al. use dependent types to encode modal logic, but I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s done or whether that&#x27;s the approach).<p>Haskell&#x27;s logic is only marginally helpful in these scenarios and I don&#x27;t know if translating from TLA+ to Java is harder or more error-prone than translating to Haskell, and even if it were, the difference (again, conjecture and gut feeling) seems to be marginal to offset the many other benefits of using Java.<p>There are some interesting uses of Haskell&#x27;s logic, such as session types (also possible in Java, BTW), but they are too underpowered to prove any distributed algorithm of interest (AFAICT, they are exactly as powerful as regular expressions).<p>What bothers me most about Haskell&#x27;s approach -- and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong -- is that the strength of the type system is pretty much defined to be &quot;anything that&#x27;s inferrable by an extended HM algorithm&quot;, which means that the strength is arbitrarily chosen to match a &quot;convenience point&quot; arbitrarily defined to be &quot;full program inference&quot;, rather than an analysis of what strength is needed, and then tweaking it to trade off some strength for convenience. So it is the features of a certain algorithm which determines the language&#x27;s semantics rather than an analysis of what&#x27;s helpful. Good examples of the latter approach would be Java, Erlang and Clojure. (BTW, a good explanation of Java&#x27;s design decision is in the first 17 minutes or so of this talk: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq2WQuWVrgQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq2WQuWVrgQ</a>)<p>That is somehow (if you squint) similar to Prolog, whose utility was determined by the quality of it search algorithms. Such approach makes for great research, but its industrial applicability is very brittle.<p>> Haskell is a significantly better language than Java ... Precisely because I can reason about Haskell programs by just evaluating Haskell by hand, whereas doing the same in Java would require me to constantly translate back and forth between Java and an external logic.<p>Even if I were to accept that premise, that only shows Haskell is better in some aspects (which I <i>gladly</i> acknowledge; Haskell is awesome![1]). A programming language is much more than that. In fact, I believe extra-linguistic features of the runtime -- e.g. GC, threading, performance, monitorability, hackability, profilability -- are a much bigger contributors to productivity (and cost) than syntax-level abstractions. But again, I have no proof, but some (strong) evidence (namely, the incredible productivity gain when the industry switched from C/C++ to Java -- which are intentionally syntactically similar but with drastic extra-linguistic changes -- and the difficulty achieving similar gains by other JVM languages (different syntax, same-or-similar extra-linguistic features).<p>EDIT:<p>Also, you kind of describe reduction as &quot;just&quot; substitution, but if Mr. Church has taught us anything it is that &quot;just substitution&quot; <i>is</i> computation, and is as powerful (well, not quite, but in some respects) as a Turing machine. So there&#x27;s no reason to assume that &quot;just substituting&quot; is any easier for a human than simulating state, be it in the mind, on a piece of paper or in a debugger (or, better yet, one of Java&#x27;s awesome time-travelling debuggers). I tend to think (without proof) that the human mind is actually better suited to state simulation than to substitution (we simulate stuff all the time; lambda substitution is a very mathematical concept).<p>To make this more concrete, recursion is limited assignment, and recursion combined with a continuation (or, in Haskell, a continuation monad) <i>is</i> imperative assignment (imperative state can be fully implemented in a pure language with continuations and recursion). So substituting across the cont monads is directly more complicated (computationally -- it requires lots of reductions) than state simulation of the very same computation.<p>[1]: But, forgive me, so is Java.",1443184384

Those are the two first and most important things that I look for to do general web application development. From that perspective it beats Javascript, Python, Php, Java, C#, Go, Scala, Erlang, Haskell, OCaml, and every other language I&#x27;ve used.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Ruby is the best language ever. It has its flaws. In a few places in the stdlib, it doesn&#x27;t make sense. There are languages, with maybe Smalltalk and Lisp at the top of the list, that beat Ruby from a simplicity and purity standpoint. But, Ruby is just great to use. I love reading it and love using it. It took a few years in the beginning of love and hate, but if I was stuck on a deserted island and had one programming language, Ruby would be it for me.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for the Ruby core group being so exclusive and bitter towards others getting involved to make it even better, and if it weren&#x27;t for the Rails core team just having too much to do and being unable to execute on support, documentation, performance, clarity, simplicity, and important features all at the same time, then maybe it would be the world&#x27;s number one language and Rails would be the number one web framework.<p>Instead Javascript had emerged years ago as the language of choice in the browser, had plenty of attention spent on making it execute quickly, etc. though it was an uglier language than Ruby, and because of that attention, it is today&#x27;s number one language for the web.

It must be a number from -10 to 10. And then we have our X and Y attributes:<p><pre><code>    my $point = Point.new( x => -1.2, y => 7.3 );\n    $point.x = 3.14;\n    $point.y = -22.0; # Boom!

This seems like a legacy annoying thing to me: why can&#x27;t it just transparently re-download them? In fact, the new iOS 9 upgrade has the &quot;delete and then re-download apps&quot; feature for those with insufficient space for upgrade. Not to mention, there&#x27;s the &quot;purchased&quot; tab on your device. So, this <i>is</i> possible!<p>Going further, even the prompt to &quot;delete and then re-download apps due to insufficient space for OS upgrade&quot; seems unnecessary, as if revealing an unimportant implementation detail. Why can&#x27;t it just automatically do the right thing? I won&#x27;t mind if the app is missing from my iPhone for a couple of minutes. If the reason is bandwidth, perhaps it could say &quot;we&#x27;ll do this on wi-fi only.&quot;<p>Similarly, I wish purchased iTunes media started working the &quot;streaming&quot; way, too.

Could still have an opt-in &quot;use offline&quot; option for those who need it.<p>Or are these all issues to appease people who want to feel like they &quot;own&quot; content (apps, media, etc.)?",1443182405

Desktop apps, web apps, iPhone apps, whatever -- getting them to the customer is so cheap it might as well be free.<p>The real question is the distribution channel and how that interacts with your business model.  Web apps and iPhone apps both have amazing distribution channels: Google and the App Store.  However, the App Store is really only amazing for the top sliver of the apps, and the rest get dregs.  You do <i>not</i> have to be one of the largest sites on the Internet to make fairly decent amounts of money on Google.  (Additionally, I strongly suspect that even if one were to look at only the head of the distribution, traditional software distributed on the web would stomp iPhone apps on pretty much any metric with the possible exception of ""dollars earned per programmer hour invested"".)<p>Now desktop apps, on the other hand, desktop apps have nearly nothing to offer a developer that a web app can't do better.  They can be distributed over the Internet for cheap!  But so can a web app.  You can get people to download them... but you can get people to sign up for a web app, easier.  You can get people to pay for them... but you can get people to pay for a web app, easier.  You can push content updates over the tubes, you can collect usage statistics, you can leverage OSS, you can... but you can do it all easier on web apps.<p>Which is a shame...

That's not relevant though, since Apple didn't complain about Google Voice using the 3g network to initiate calls in its FCC statement. From the TC article linked above:<p>""When [you get a] call, the service can either relay the call to your ‘real’ number (the AT&T number assigned to your iPhone), or it can send it to voicemail, depending on the way you’ve set up your call filters.""<p>This is exactly what Google Voice does, and Line2 even included a similar ""visual voicemail"" feature from the start. It also duplicated the iPhone's dialer <i>pixel for pixel</i>. In Apple's FCC statement the stated reasons for Google Voice's rejection were re-routing of voicemail, duplication of ""visual voicemail,"" and duplication of the iPhone's native dialing functionality.<p>Is there a claim in the FCC statement against the Google Voice app that doesn't also apply to Line2's app?<p>And Google didn't address the flaws, because there were no flaws to address!

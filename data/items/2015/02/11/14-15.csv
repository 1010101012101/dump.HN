9033145,comment,9032598,9032835,0,0,sergiosgc,,,"Counting in base 12 is much better than base 10. 12 has prime factors {2,2,3}, so you get 2,3,4 and 6 as integer divisors, not just 2 and 5. That&#x27;s why dozens stuck as a counting unit on so many things, namely time (all the way back from Egyptians).<p>You can even count using your fingers. Just count using your thumb pointing at each of the finger joints and the finger tip (you have two joints and one tip per finger and four fingers excluding the thumb). Actually, that&#x27;s how Egyptians counted and that&#x27;s why you get 12 hours in the realm of day and 12 hours in the realm of night.<p>The only drawback is multiplication tables. If I tend to forget the multiplication table for 7 and 8, memorizing tables for 11 and 12 would be nightmarish :-)<p>P.S. This is obviously tongue-in-cheek. While it <i>may</i> be marginally better, switching costs mean the optimal course of action is to stay at the local maximum and avoid switching.",1423666753

It is assigned based a failure to conform to very specific rules of the road - operating left of center (or right, depending on the country), failure to yield, etc.  Human factors are taken into consideration, but there is certainly an existing framework for assigning responsibility that appears to be quite compatible with autonomous operators.

This is a term that&#x27;s often used to describe web or mobile development, so in this context I take it as being able to do things like platform setup and maintenance, write a backend, write a front-end, do the design, etc.<p>This term really caught on with people who develop for the web because there actually is a divide here: some people really prefer the front-end work (JS/HTML/CSS), some people prefer the backend work (sysadmin/app logic/data stores) and some people prefer both.<p>So basically, if someone says &quot;full stack&quot;, they likely mean that you can develop and run the entire product, not just a part of it.<p>Having said that, I strongly encourage everyone to go deeper. Learn some C. Figure out the difference between a function and a syscall. Understand what the kernel does and how it works (whichever kernel you happen to use). Write a toy libc. Program for a microcontroller (try adding RAM to a microcontroller circuit for added fun). Play some Minecraft. Write a bit of assembly. Create a data store. Develop a JS framework for DOM manipulation. Create a toy programming language. Write a malloc implementation. Write a kernel module (maybe a driver to that microcontroller device you put together). Write a web server. I find that the more of this kind of stuff you do, the more aware you become of what `display: block;` will do and how to structure your code better.",1423666451

Define that as &quot;full stack&quot; and ignore anything still below.<p>For most people the process seems to terminate somewhere around the kernel/user boundary, much like someone in a boat who&#x27;s aware of the vast shapes moving below but never gets a clear sighting.  IMX a typical &quot;full stack&quot; engineer can manage things like routing tables and logical volumes, understands that context switches and page faults matter, but becomes increasingly unable to explain what they really are to others.  By the time you get e.g. to different kinds of cache misses or database/compiler internals (even those are still out in user space) forget it.<p>TBH I think most &quot;full stack&quot; engineers are half-stack at best.  So am I.  Twenty years ago the upper parts of a modern stack didn&#x27;t exist and I could explain pretty much everything in the lower parts from tty to network to disk plus VM/schedulers/etc.  Maybe back then I could have called myself a full stack engineer.

9032909,comment,9030314,9030832,0,0,PakG1,,,"This is an excellent point.  During university, I was part of a team that published a business case centred around the story of Vidalia Sweet Onions.  This guy had developed a technology that took a sample of onions from a farmer&#x27;s field, crushed the onions, and analyzed them for the characteristics that made for sweetness.  The batches were tagged with grid numbers to enable farmers to confirm which plots of land had the type of soil necessary to make truly sweet onions.  This then enabled the farmers to guarantee the sweetness level of various onions.  The old guard was absolutely against it, as the collective of farmers that sold under the brand of Vidalia onions partly depended on the mysticism of not knowing which plots of land were able to generate sweet onions.  Without this testing technology, the farmers were all on a level playing field, irregardless of their actual soil composition.  The testing technology was able to clarify which emperors had no clothes.  Whether a farmer can or should be able to own the data that is critical to his success is a question people never really had to consider before.<p>I liken it to mining.  The companies who dig for various mineral deposits make significant investments into exploration of the ground.  Their exploration generates a ton of data.  They use that data to determine where to dig further and estimate the financial potential of the deposits.  This then determines company stock values.  It&#x27;s ludicrous that such data may not be owned by the mining company that generated it (or acquired the rights for it).  Obviously, what&#x27;s happening with farms and FarmLogs is not a perfect analogy.  But the parallels are interesting.",1423664073

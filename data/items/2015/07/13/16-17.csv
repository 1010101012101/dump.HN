I don&#x27;t think researchers are making that assumption.<p>In addition, race was used as an example because it is one of the sensitive attributes. The decision on what makes an attribute sensitive is based on deep discussions by society. The author of the blog post wants to communicate two points - (1) Algorithms can discriminate and (2) There is a need to understand HOW algorithms discriminate.",1436806696

9879334,comment,9872504,9877031,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Well, one would have to be careful with this.  A business has the responsibility and right to present the public persona they think best matches their goals or the image they wish to portray to the public.  In that context, treating some user submitted content with a &quot;totalitarian&quot; approach is, well, justified.<p>As an example, there is no reason for Apple to tolerate racist remarks in their user fora.  That sort of things has nothing to do with their company and the image they wish to portray.  The right thing to do is to remove such posts and ban the users who post them right away.<p>How about a political discussion forum?  Should they allow racist discussions?  That&#x27;s a stretch.  Don&#x27;t know.  The stuff is nasty.  However, one could argue it is better in the open than behind closed doors because it could serve to inform, educate and perhaps convince a few people to change their ideology for the better.<p>This is an extreme example, of course, yet this sort of thing is exactly why I said moderation systems are difficult to implement.  I don&#x27;t know of anyone who&#x27;s done it &quot;right&quot; (in quotes because we don&#x27;t really know what that means).  There are mod systems that work reasonably well but not all the time.  In HN&#x27;s case some subjects bring out cargo-cult down-voting and alternative opinions are simply squashed down.  That&#x27;s just the way it is.<p>Keep in mind that these fora don&#x27;t have to be about freedom of speech.  They are private sites with their own ecosystems and rules.  I you don&#x27;t like it you can leave.<p>My approach on a site like HN is to envision mass down-voters as post-adolescent emotional cargo-cult voters who have been indoctrinated or peer-pressured into thinking in a certain way.  They have little life experience as the basis of their opinions and seem to refuse to get past the indoctrination or cargo-cult mentality to actually analyze issues before forming an opinion.  In other words, their opinions are given to them, they are not the result of life experience and analysis.<p>For example, there are plenty of people on HN who will post about business without ever having started or operated one.  You can see them a mile away because of how ridiculous their comments are in the context of someone who has launched and operated one or more real businesses.  These people will down-vote opinions of someone with experience because they probably sound harsh or foreign to them.<p>They, for example, don&#x27;t understand the interaction between taxation and business decisions or government and business growth.  And yet you can&#x27;t fault them because they simply don&#x27;t have the life experience.  These are things that are nearly impossible to teach.  You can read about it all you want in a book.   Your brain does not &quot;click&quot; into reality mode until, for example, a government official shows up at your business asking you to pay the county a &quot;privilege&quot; tax on your desk, printer, computer, chairs, refrigerator and machinery (this is a real thing, BTW).<p>Once you transition into considering the source of down-votes none of it bothers you.  Just state your position and ignore the down-votes.  Life is good.",1436806652

You can be in the Schengen countries for 90 days out of 180. The Common Travel Area (UK, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey) is its own region.

Once you’ve spent those 90 days there you are free to return to to the Schengen area for another 90 days.

First, Unsafe provides some immensely useful features to the Java ecosystem. Second, there is no alternative to Unsafe on the JVM. That includes JNI (native code integrated within the JVM).<p>So far, Oracle has stated their intent to remove Unsafe from Java 9. To all the users of Unsafe, Oracle is basically saying, &quot;tell us your use cases for Unsafe, and if we decide they are valid we may try to create an alternative for you. If you&#x27;re lucky, we may even ship that alternative in Java 9 or 10! Have a nice day!&quot;<p>Many people, myself included, find this unacceptable. For instance, it looks like several groups are currently collaborating on a document discussing uses cases for Unsafe and whether alternative features satisfying those use cases are expected to appear in Java 9:<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GDm_cAxYInmoHMor-AkStzWvwE9pw6tnz_CebJQxuUE/edit?pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GDm_cAxYInmoHMor-AkStzWv...</a><p>As you can see, the majority of the cells in the column &quot;Expected in Java 9&quot; flat out say &quot;no&quot;.

And what we now know is that we do have that capacity, but furthermore what we know is that nerve regeneration in the brain is very much regulated by these marijuana-like compounds, these endocannabinoids. So we have a whole host of very important activities, the direct protection of nerves from dying, the promotion of regeneration, the promotion of learning, of re-learning things, is a very important biological effect of our endocannabinoid system.<p>So what are the kinds of things we can do to try and promote health in these areas? On the one hand, everybody should make sure they take in enough essential fatty acids. And certainly I would say one of the best sources for that is we should be consuming hemp oil. And the reason I say hemp oil as opposed to fish oil is because you can ensure organic hemp oil is not contaminated with things like mercury. And that&#x27;s going to allow our bodies to make our endocannabinoids.<p>We often hear about the beneficial effects of things like Omega-3s and Omega-6s, and at least some of the attributes of those compounds are the result of them being converted into endocannabinoids. So at least that way your body can do what your body can do. You&#x27;re giving it the tools to make the things that you need. But in many cases, that&#x27;s not sufficient, and we have to supplement beyond what our body can make. And there&#x27;s only one plant on the planet that has the capacity to mimic the way our body works with these endocannabinoids, and that&#x27;s marijuana.<p>So marijuana actually directly mimics these particular compounds, and as a result, it has these strong neuroprotectant effects. But because marijuana and these endocannabinoids, their activities are so pervasive in our bodies, they literally regulate every system in your body, your immune system, digestive system, reproductive system, cardiovascular system. Everything in your body is homeostatically maintained by endocannabinoids, meaning balance. They&#x27;re how our body tries to balance how we interact with the environment when our environment becomes stressful for us, stressful psychologically, stressful biochemically. So these are very, very critical compounds and the use of cannabis can have a profound effect in terms of helping to stop nerve cell degeneration, helping restore functional nerves, helping restore new ways of thinking. And this is just really touching on the surface of the humongous number of benefits that this plant can have for so many different illnesses.<p>... and what our cannabinoids system is evolved to do over many hundreds of millions of years has been to protect us from those kinds of inbalances. To restore the kind of health that we need. And because of our environment, in particular because we are living longer, we need to be able to adapt very rapidly today, and we can&#x27;t do that on an evolutionary scale. The way for us to do that as people, as intelligent people, is to make sure we&#x27;re eating good diets, stay away from toxins, and eat these essential fatty acids, and when necessary, consume cannabinoids.&quot;<p>- Dr. Bob Melamed, Ph.D., UC Colorado Springs<p><a href=""http://www.uccs.edu/rmelamed/endocannabinoids-and-medical-marijuana/dr-bobs-video-links.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uccs.edu/rmelamed/endocannabinoids-and-medical-ma...</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeeVBSERb-c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeeVBSERb-c</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP5yxaVksbY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP5yxaVksbY</a>",1436806264

Several of his crazy &quot;alien&quot; races (sometimes Earth-based) have their extreme powers due to technological progress, such as the Elder Things (genetic engineering), the Great Race (time-traveling & mind-swapping), and the Yi-Go (brains-in-jars and inter-stellar travel). Many of his human antagonists are also developing forbidding science/technology, although usually with some alchemy thrown in. Even crazy creatures obey physical laws that happen to not be known; more than one creature disintegrates on death because its body is an exotic type of matter, and at least one creature is invisible for the same reason.<p>A lot of the horror of Lovecraft&#x27;s works stem from a fear of science-gone-too-far. I read an interesting essay that said that his regression-to-past-generations works were actually founded in the contemporary revulsion many people felt they were first introduced to this newfangled &quot;evolution&quot; business (augmented by Lovecraft&#x27;s notorious racism).<p>You&#x27;ll also notice that a lot of the science in Lovecraft&#x27;s stories isn&#x27;t, uh, <i>good</i>. Like, it&#x27;s really bad. Creatures that flap their wings and fly out of the atmosphere, and to a different dimension. Stars that are far away have different laws of physics. That sort of thing.<p>Imagine someone who is a mild conspiracy nut (of the email-forwarding variety), and not scientifically literate but reading pop-science articles about new breakthroughs in the 20s and 30s. The majority of Lovecraft&#x27;s writings are a fair description of this hypothetical person&#x27;s fears about scientific progress.<p>Lovecraft&#x27;s cosmic horror is still fairly rules-based, i.e. it&#x27;s magic of the Clarke&#x27;s-Third-Law variety. The dreaming in Call of Cthulhu is a natural force that obeys laws. Humans don&#x27;t know what those laws are, but something does and can manipulate that force. Cthulhu itself doesn&#x27;t obey our laws of physics, but there are laws of physics that he obeys (possibly from another dimension), and he is also subject to the alignment of the stars. It&#x27;s all described as rationally explainable, but not within the bounds of what human intelligence can graps.<p>The actual Dreamlands stuff with Randolph Carter is different, though. It&#x27;s not even horror, really. It&#x27;s Lovecraft making an explicitly Fantasy setting, in emulation of Lord Dunsany. It&#x27;s got a much more whimsical and adventurous vibe, and the various fantastical elements (horrific or otherwise) generally aren&#x27;t as rationally-explainable.",1436805829

9879224,comment,9878991,9878991,0,0,hluska,,,"Since I left University, I have gone through a few periods where I felt that I had plateaued and stopped climbing, both in my career and in terms of learning. To snap out of this, I found the following helpful:<p>a) I changed my perspective. In University, learning was broken up into easy to digest semester long chunks. In four months, I would write papers, write exams and receive marks which sort of indicated what I had learned. Since University, I have had to change my expectations, both in terms of chunks of time and in terms of feedback. I try to remind myself that I am learning, but sometimes I just learn in chunks that are almost too small to notice.<p>b) I keep a journal about what I am learning and what I am working on. This journal tends to be long on opinion. Every few months, I go back and read how far I have come. For me, there is no better way of seeing how far I have come than to read how wrong I used to be. Hacker News helps with this, since there is no shortage of extremely smart people who are willing to tell me that I am wrong.<p>c) I added hobbies. When I was in University, learning was my job and all of my hobbies and social interactions were built around this. Since University, I have picked up some hobbies. For me, lifting weights and jogging started off as a way to solve a serious health/stress problem and evolved into a bonafide hobby. I may not be learning as much as I was in University, but I can bench press my weight now and run 10km at will. Progress (of any sort) is addictive for me and it forces me to keep finding ways to progress.<p>d) I got into public speaking. In University, I belonged to a Toastmasters chapter, but after University, I not only joined another chapter, but I started seeking out speaking opportunities. Not only did my public speaking improve, but I have learned an immense amount through speaking in public. The old adage that you never really know something until you can explain it to someone who knows nothing is 100% true.<p>Right now, my biggest challenge is to incorporate meditation into my day to day routine. I love meditating and I know that it makes me a better, more mindful person, but it is hard for me to incorporate it. My hope is that a little more mindfulness will keep me from obsessing about the big picture (where change is so slow) and keep me in the moment.<p>Good luck, my friend and if you need anyone to talk to, my email is in my profile.",1436805768

It goes without saying.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, though perhaps I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by &quot;unsafe serialization&quot;.<p>First, I suspect one can use JNI and get at least as good performance. There are other tradeoffs, like the ease of packaging, but in order to evaluate those we need a clear problem statement.<p>Second, premature optimization is the root of all evil, and we should be looking at realistic benchmarks to determine that there is a performance gain. There are many documented examples of software safety checks adding negligible performance overhead because they get branch-predicted away. Alternatively, new hardware support like Intel&#x27;s MPX adds bounds-checking at the instruction level, so if we&#x27;re talking about raw writes to a bounds-checked buffer (which is a vast improvement over raw writes to anywhere), this can probably be implemented efficiently on new hardware. On old hardware, the JVM could implement these as unchecked writes, which preserves the exact same performance, but the API would now have information to add safety where it is performant.<p>Finally, sun.misc.Unsafe covers a <i>lot</i> of ground. If we can restrict it to the specific uses that these projects make of it, that&#x27;s still an improvement. I don&#x27;t think these libraries use the whole thing, do they?<p>Very few things in science go without saying, and software performance and correctness is science.",1436805524

9879156,comment,9878482,9878482,0,0,bowyakka,,,"Ok moving past the rhetoric of don&#x27;t use internal classes, there is a value to sun.misc.Unsafe. It has been well known by Oracle for some time that it has to go away right.<p>Realise that those of us that do use it, are fully aware that it is a hack, and that we should be doing cleaner things. However know that those cleaner things _dont exist_; and that you, Dear application developer might not quite realise some of the shadow puppetry in making your favourite library work, please lay off the bile.<p>As others have said, this blog post stops short, the full quote is part of a very long and ongoing process to rid ourselves of Unsafe, replacing its majors usages with new API&#x27;s.<p>This is a process Oracle started last year after the previous sun.reflect.Reflection.getCalleeClass mess. Yes, it no one should have been using an internal class. This method did not go away; it was made only available to the JVM internals, locked out from end users. The upshot of this was that, with no sane alternative, suddenly logging became between 2x and 100x more expensive where class names become involved. The JDK team somewhat back peddled on this change, and we are stuck here in a strange limbo land.<p>Was it right of Oracle to do this? Absolutely, everyone who goes down the internal package route is fully aware that these are open-state secrets, sure we all know them, but we should not be talking about them. Support for these damn things requires version to version checking, hideous reflection hacks and being prepared to read a lot of JVM source code for when bugs occur.<p>In light of all of this, and being the general level of awesome the JDK folks are they started a very direct community outreach to remove safely Unsafe. Last year they publicly asked people on the mailing list, and privately via email to do a survey (<a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2014-January/024650.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2014-Ja...</a>) on usages of Unsafe. I know this because I got an email from Paul Sandoz asking me to comment on Unsafe abusages. \nOut of previous thinking from the JDK folks, as well as from the aforementioned survey, we have a bunch of JEP&#x27;s for improving things regarding Unsafe.<p>Where things have gone slightly sideways is that we have, currently no unified working group to deal with these changes. What this document is, is a proposal to make a working group, focused on getting the right changes into the JVM. In the same ways as Project Jigsaw is for modularising the JVM (and is indirectly responsible for removing Unsafe), or the MLVM project handled making the VM better support other languages.<p>Unsafe is dead, long live Unsafe! I fully expect that we will achieve the right changes in during Java 9 to allow those of us that need to break the rules, to do it in a supported fashion.\nI am _looking_ forward to the day when I can do setMemory or getAndSetInt via a supported API, and not one where I have to know the words Unsafe.theUnsafe.

This means that if you want to predict something, and that something is correlated with some some uncomfortable association, trying to predict the something without the uncomfortable association can leave little residual behind.<p>For example, if hair length is societally taboo for gender prediction and I make an algorithm that uses a &quot;politically correct&quot; determination using XY chromosomes, I have also made an algorithm that correlates with hair length. Moreover, if I try to statistically correct my algorithm so that it does not correlate with hair length, I end up with an algorithm that works on the tiny leftover residual created by people who buck the trend, i.e. one that&#x27;s much more likely to be wrong.<p>Algorithms find both correlational and causal factors. If 9/10 men are from Mars, and you tell me you&#x27;re from Mars, it is often via correlation that the algorithm labels you a man.

Last week I finished interviewing and now have four offers from four smallish companies. They&#x27;re all exceptional places to work: very talented engineers, very friendly employees, driven and knowledgeable founders, very interesting work, and so on. I would be happy working at any of these companies, although I have put together a ranking of which companies I prefer to work on.<p>So my question is: Given that I have four good offers, how can I negotiate a better offer?<p>It feels unprofessional to ask for a certain compensation, and then, if given that compensation, reject the offer anyways. But on the other hand, if all the companies were willing to offer 15% more compensation, perhaps the company I want to work for most would be willing to offer it as well, so it seems like I should try to negotiate with several offers at once.<p>What would you do in this situation (if negotiating a higher compensation were important to you)?

You mentioned management buy-in: a key selling point is that even outside of the talks+workshops, an internal con provides a discrete, intentional space for these spread-out teams to work together for a few days, outside of the pipeline of their &quot;regular&quot; work. Essentially you are bringing the benefit of hackathons & sprints to internal projects, using the structure of a conference for framing.<p>As far as &quot;how to get devs to speak&quot; -- lots of devs do like speaking (or teaching workshops), and maybe it&#x27;s easier to do that for an audience of immediate peers and coworkers? But for many public speaking IS hard, and a way to mitigate that barrier is to consider the idea of an unconference [1]. When you move away from the standard tech talk format (stage, mic, podium, etc) and towards an &quot;unconference session&quot; (white board, circle of chairs, participant-set agenda), you can get a surprisingly high level of participation.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear of any experiences with this kind of thing at a smaller company, but essentially I think the core advantages (sprints, intentional technical discussion, knowledge exchange/training) are things that can be scaled up or down at will.<p>1) e.g., <a href=""http://transparencycamp.org/about/tips/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transparencycamp.org/about/tips/</a>",1436804623

I&#x27;m almost sad that I commented given how this has gone to shit and the pretense of an intelligent conversation is gone...<p>Fact is, as an American, particularly one who lives in a southern state where a gun can (legally) be purchased for cash in a grocery store parking lot with no record, if someone were to break into my house, there is a non-trivial chance that were someone to break into my home they would be armed. Given that I&#x27;m single and live by myself, were someone to break in all I would have to do is take a defensive position in some room, phone the police, and announce to the intruder that police are on their way and that I am armed. Now what if I had a wife and kids? That changes the dynamic. What do you plan on doing in that case? Running through a house with a potentially armed intruder while you are not armed? Truth be told, there aren&#x27;t a lot of wide open spaces in a house and as a 6&#x27;3&quot;, 230lb male could probably overpower a <i>single</i> intruder. What if you have more than one? I&#x27;m a boy scout at heart. Be Prepared.<p>How likely is all of this? Dunno, my brother has suffered an armed home invasion. My neighbor was luckily not home when his was broken into. A coworker almost got carjacked last month, and him being armed saved his ass. Hell, I once narrowly missed getting into a car accident and when I pulled over to make sure the other car that ran off the road was fine, I nearly got jumped by a couple guys that had a couple inches and quite a few pounds of muscle on me. I&#x27;d rather not get the shit beat out of me because someone got some mud on their Mercedes. Draw a line in the sand, if they cross it they fucked up.

I certainly wish I lived in a Western European country (for more reasons than a little more sanity about firearms... if only my mother had attained US-German dual citizenship as she very well could have, oh well) and this wasn&#x27;t as much of a thing, but I don&#x27;t and I doubt I&#x27;ll have much luck getting over there in the near future, so I&#x27;ve got to play the hand I&#x27;ve been dealt.

My point is not that they never are (as in some universal truth).  It&#x27;s that the real answer is  that it depends.

9879053,comment,9878160,9878160,0,0,soperj,,,"&quot;The Pacific Northwest sits squarely within the Ring of Fire. Off its coast, an oceanic plate is slipping beneath a continental one. Inland, the Cascade volcanoes mark the line where, far below, the Juan de Fuca plate is heating up and melting everything above it. In other words, the Cascadia subduction zone has, as Goldfinger put it, “all the right anatomical parts.” Yet not once in recorded history has it caused a major earthquake—or, for that matter, any quake to speak of. By contrast, other subduction zones produce major earthquakes occasionally and minor ones all the time: magnitude 5.0, magnitude 4.0, magnitude why are the neighbors moving their sofa at midnight. You can scarcely spend a week in Japan without feeling this sort of earthquake. You can spend a lifetime in many parts of the Northwest—several, in fact, if you had them to spend—and not feel so much as a quiver.&quot;  This is total crap. There was a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in Seattle in 2001.",1436804225

The demand of this type of product is likely to rise.  As self broadcasting goes up, the demand of this type of ingenuity will rise.  What Twitch is doing for gaming, this could help bring along for many other areas of interest.<p>2. Through internal development or by going open source, the development of tracking could be increased to support a number of different objects.  Pucks/Balls in sports in particular could be very interesting to automate the recording of sporting events.<p>With these 2 points noted, I can imagine the use of these in a number of scenarios- for consistency of an argument, I&#x27;ll take the use case of hockey.<p>If I&#x27;m a minor league hockey team, if I can obtain the proper quality of cameras at a reasonable enough price to surround my rink, along with the proper tracking system applied to each player and devices of the game (pucks, nets), and if I can coordinate this with software to turn on which devices I follow per camera at any point, I could create a system for broadcasting a top quality version of my game online without the cost of camera men as well as the space that may be required for the setup.<p>Additionally, if I&#x27;m the team, I could use this in practice to follow each of my players setting a camera to each so that I can review their particular actions and do video review with each - without having to limit what gets taped for each guy or having multiple camera guys at each practice.<p>Add this to object recognition software and I could start using the cameras to collect more about where people are on the ice during games and plays and push along my ability to analyze what is happening and how I can work on tactics/strategy to manage it.<p>Again, a lot of this is relying on additional software/tracking/processes but I believe as a technology, it&#x27;s empowering.  I&#x27;m not sure the current use case/expected market is ready for this (or at least not in the form it&#x27;s likely to have technically) but I believe in a few iterations, we&#x27;ll see something that serves a significant market share, especially if the product roadmap includes abilities and integrations to further its use with other software and mutiple unit tracking capabilities.",1436803588

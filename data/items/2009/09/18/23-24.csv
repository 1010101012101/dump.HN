My point is to show what can happen when products are sold as services and/or when a product or service can be controlled after the initial transaction.<p>I have no hatred of Apple. I am a fan of their products and use them daily.  I think they are doing pretty much what any other company in its position would do.  If society doesn't want this sort of behavior, we have to regulate against it. That's how we control the boundaries of what companies can do.<p>I think this case of Apple/ATT/Google is a good battleground for fleshing out these issues before for example, the nature of things like books changes drastically.  Apple isn't the only one testing these boundaries.  We've seen the music companies try. Now we're seeing inroads in Books.  What happens when every product becomes a service?  What happens when every product must be extended through the same provider that you made the initial transaction?",1253318020

831410,comment,831029,831155,0,0,brk,,,"Craigslist is a fairly unfiltered portal into society.  It is not based on relationships like facebook, it does not require more extensive seller verification like ebay.  It is basically the newspaper classifieds in an online format with only a twinge of technology sprinkled in.<p>Craigslist is easy to use and the primarily text-driven approach means it is accessible to even users on dial-up connections (and although you might think this rare, I still know people in the US who have no viable high-speed Internet options and are using dial-up).<p>Fraud is, IMO, inherent in society.  Manipulative and creative people have been taking advantage of trusting or less educated people since man first implemented a monetary instrument.<p>I think part of the make-a-better-Craigslist camp is similar to some of the confusion around the mint.com sale... Not everybody has the same motivations... I don't think Craigslist wants to be the best/safest/most-diverse online classifieds system.  I think they want to be the easiest, simplest, I-can-go-home-at-night-and-not-be-bothered online classifieds system.  There are many things they could do to be ""better"", but I don't believe the cost and complexity is worth the impact on the lives of the employees and the business overall.<p>There is a market opportunity for an improved Craigslist, but it's a little bit of an end-of-the-rainbow pursuit.",1253317553

From Apple's perspective they have the most widely used mobile web device in terms of actual usage. Nokia, RIM, etc sell more units but the iPhone dominates mobile usage. Google is already the default search & map provider for the iPhone delivering tens of millions of users and probably hundreds of millions of ad views to Google. Perhaps Google Voice could be a default also? What if Apple were willing to either build the functionality into the core software or simply pre-install the GV app on every iPhone? Maybe Apple feels like they are becoming the real mobile gateway to the Internet and might deserve a bigger slice of Google's pie?

831403,story,,,5,5,throwaway567,"How to create an anonymous website?",,"Hi,<p>This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.<p>I'm looking to create an anonymous site, which will need hosting and domain registration. The site will only need static files served from it. All ideally with no trace back to me. And that won't be pulled by an ISP at the first letter from a lawyer.\nDoes anyone know an easy and inexpensive way to do this?<p>Why?<p>I'm in the UK and some months ago signed up to a course in a non tech related field. Fees were required in advance so I did the usual searches and visited the premises before paying a sum of around Â£10,000.<p>Following the ""start"" of the course it very quickly became very clear there was literally nothing backing them up and no chance of actually learning anything or gaining a qualification. Through a series of calls, emails and letters I tried to resolve this and am currently undergoing legal proceedings to try and recoup some of the fees.<p>I have recently discovered there are at least several dozen people who feel they have been duped by the same company. Two years ago, through legal channels, they had them shut down and the owner blacklisted from running a company in the UK. They resurfaced a year later with the previous owner's son as the new director and have since begun re-advertising under a different name.<p>As they are a small course (with high fees) it would be very easy to get high in the search results for anyone searching for their name(s).<p>>><p>I do not want to post anything slanderous or untrue online, just a warning to other prospective students that there is a very high dissatisfaction rate with previous students (possibly over 50%), with examples of the problems faced by some.<p>I would prefer to remain anonymous for the time being at least until other legal action has gone its course.<p>Thanks",1253317024

I know, I'm being pedantic here, but I think you're reading far too much into what she actually said.<p>Edit: I'm more and more confused about where you think she would be wrong anyway if the did vote this way, since you do don't think corporations should enjoy the status of legal persons. How would a suggestion that corporations don't enjoy constitutional protections infringe on the individual rights of those shareholders?<p>Presumably, even if DownWithPedro Corp is forbidden from advertising on the eve of the election, I could still write an impassioned screed on the same subject in my own name. to be honest, I think the reason this particular company (in the lawsuit under discussion) exists is not to make a profit but to protect its investors from the financial risks of being sued for libel if they released the film as a group of individuals without the benefit of limited liability.<p><i>If the company is later convicted ... make sense to claw back into previously paid dividends ...</i><p>I agree with most of what you say. We are not so far apart on the possible implementations. My beef is not with the basics of capitalism per se, but the fact that nowadays at least, arcane corporate structures are all too often employed to diffuse responsibility to the point of meaninglessness. In the Pfizer case I mentioned, one sales manager got 6 months of house arrest plus a $100 fine, which I frankly thought was just as unfair to Pfizer shareholders as to consumers. A few years back I thought Sarbanes-Oxley would lead to meaningful reforms in comporate decision making and risk management, but the events of the last 2 years have proved me woefully mistaken :-/",1253316986

Corporations stand to GAIN a right here, not lose one.<p>Here is my biased view of the issue.  If corporations gain the right to unlimited direct political advertising, then they will have a much more powerful lobbying option than any they have already.  This will give incumbent corporate powers increased influence.<p>It is the nature of incumbents to try to maintain their dominant position by fair means or foul.  Therefore we'll see companies asking the government to erect more powerful barriers to competition.  These barriers will often be bad for startups and innovation.<p>Obvious examples of barriers are expanded patent and copyright laws.  However that is just the start.  Suppose that the oil industry decided that the right president pursuing the right foreign policy would improve their profit margin by 5%.  If they had invested 1% of their 2008 profits into the last election, that would have been more than both presidential campaigns spent together.

Now sometimes reading a newspaper article feels like sitting through a business school class.

Now, would it be fair for someone to say 'no way, you can't sell that because you haven't owned it long enough?' I do think your heart is in the right place - managing for the long term and so forth - but your 6-month hold is extremely unfair to the individual investor, and would just result in the creation of unregulated off-market exchanges, like pawnshops for stock certificates. I mean suppose I buy IBM but next month they are hit by some financial scandal, I have to sit with my bad investment for another 5 months and watch the price crater as most of the existing shareholders sell?<p><i>Short term investments are always (no exceptions) an attempt to game the system or trade on inside information</i><p>I don't agree. I can think o a wide variety of reasons for short-term buying, and don't think regulators should be in the business of judging motives. I'm afraid I think this forceful imposition of long-term ownership criteria would only cause the market to become bloated and sclerotic and the cure would be just as bad as, if not worse than, the disease.",1253315063

Yes, this is my third time asking this same question but only because I thought different submission times would make a difference in the number of responses I got.<p>Anyway, I didn't give you a specific response because I didn't want to limit possible solutions based on a price ceiling. If the solution costs X, whatever X may be, then an assessment of whether X is worth paying to create this solution would be in order.<p>I genuinely hope you don't take this as a runaround to your specific question - it's as specific of a response I can offer you with the limited knowledge that I have of the solution costs.",1253314955

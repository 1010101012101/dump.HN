661352,comment,661218,661343,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I seriously doubt they reimplemented GTA4 with raytracing. Raytracing can exploit some of the coherence in camera location in its scene traversal, but its never been faster than rasterising a 'normal' game scene and if it is ever faster it won't be because of a matrix multiplication on the scene data.<p>The thing that both OTOY and Onlive seem to have done is make fast video compressor - which while impressive most likely is made possible because the hardest step in video compression is detecting interframe motion which is available to the compressor directly from the rendering data.",1245211092

Legacy users are a bitch ;-)<p>The idea of allowing any top-level css class be used as a mixin is a really interesting one that we could consider adding to sass. However, I would argue that you still need an abstract class syntax like the current mixin, especially where arguments are in use.<p>As a sass framework builder, I really like that I don't have to define a presentational class name that would end up in your stylesheets just so that you can mix them into your semantic selectors.

""Wow, I've heard of a woman programmer, too!"" is stigmatizing, although I'm sure that wasn't intended.<p>I work in Japan, and am one of probably three white guys in my industry in the greater Nagoya area.

I suppose the appropriate remark would be ""Oh, a Big Freaking Enterprise Web Apps Java programmer -- I've met one of you before!"".

661331,comment,660674,661290,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I think you made the right call. CSS isn't complex enough to need a framework. In a lot of cases, CSS frameworks abuse the primary motivating factor for trying to separate style and content in the first place. If I have to use particular HTML markup or class naming conventions, I may as well just forego the separation of content and style altogether and use table layouts.<p>But less appears to make desperately needed additions that should ultimately show up in CSS itself IMHO. Certainly when I was first picking up CSS -- given my programming background -- I was reaching for the concept of variables and in fact was surprised that they did not exist in CSS. For that reason, I'd consider less to be more of a language extension than a framework.",1245209559

661325,comment,660674,661290,0,0,chriseppstein,,,"You're still confusing sass and compass.<p>Like I said, your current feature set is ample for the 95% use case of normal web development. To that end, we are in complete agreement.<p>I don't know how familiar you are with blueprint, but the less syntax doesn't support creating new abstractions that simplify design.<p>In sass using the compass port of blueprint we can do this:<p>#sidebar
  +column(8)<p>which generates:<p>#sidebar {
  float: left;
  margin-right: 10px;
  width: 310px; }<p>The column mixin is defined here: <a href=""http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/blob/master/frameworks/blueprint/stylesheets/blueprint/modules/_grid.sass#L101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/blob/master/framewor...</a><p>So what could be the equivalent less syntax for this?<p>div#sidebar { .column: 8; }<p>This is wonderfully easy for end users, but the language syntax has to become more complicated to support it. You have to be able to specify the arguments for the mixin. Also, you need a way to refer to the parent selector within the mixin abstractly. In sass we use the & symbol to represent the selector's context. I don't know what a ""css-like"" syntax would be for these capabilities. I would argue that they don't really have to be that ""css-y"", but they just have to play nicely with existing CSS syntax, because normal users don't need them.<p>Anyways, it's your project... But I've spent the last year thinking about these sorts of issues. If you want to discuss further, you can hit me up on github.<p>-chris",1245209377

People tend to be less on guard themselves when presented with bad or biased journalism. At least with twitter, people are less inclined to take everything at face value.<p>Anyway, I am confident. Earlier on people were making ridiculous arguments about how the internet is an untrustworthy source of information. All sorts of things that were highly speculative or untrue where being put online. Douglas Adams compare this to saying you can't believe everything you here on the telephone. I think this applies here too.<p>Twitter is new. People don't know how to treat it properly yet. The information you hear on a bus can be unreliable. It shouldn't be treated as a perfect sample.  It may contain the opinions of crazy people, biased people & bus drivers. But it's still information. People are good at sifting through this kind of information.",1245208671
661315,comment,661218,661253,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>render the full 720p image remotely</i><p>Ah, there's the rub. It may be rendering a 720p canvas, but for all we know it's rendering a filthy blotchy version of it - much like streaming movies sounds great (and is good as far as it goes), but when you put the image next to a well-mastered DVD - never mind an actual HD system - the differences are painfully obvious. Similarly, if you've ever uploaded some pristine video, which you know very well, to YouTube and then looked at it a few hours later it looks pretty hideous at the normal quality, and only OK at the high quality.<p>In both these demos the video looks fairly smooth and responsive, but all the same we're seeing OTOY as filmed on a screen by a camcorder and then further compressed by YouTube itself. I strongly suspect that an uncompressed (or non-lossy) capture from FRAPS of the actual video in the browser window will make the difference pretty stark. I would love to be wrong of course.<p>The other thing I wonder is how this is going to scale and what they need at the server end (I sure can't see this being peer to peer). It does make a difference if the server side is running an nVidia Tesla (~$1500 and up) or some similar graphics powerhouse to do the almost real time compression.<p>It's still impressive, I like the concept, and they sure took on a big challenge. But I'm not expecting Crysis on the iPhone anytime soon. On a side note, although gaming has the most obvious market and monetization potential, what I find exciting about Otoy are the possibilities for film and scientific visualization.",1245208629

Yeah, I know that twitter is real-time, but some times I can't or don't want to read tweets as they are posted to the web. I've often wished to have a summarized version of say @zeldman 's tweets.

If your plugin has an infinite loop, Vim hangs forever. If your plugin does network I/O, Vim hangs until the socket read/write is finished. The only work-around is to use non-blocking sockets and abuse CursorHold/CursorHoldI autocommands and updatetime. That trick breaks the leaderkey, which is a show-stopper for many users.

7280018,comment,7279262,7279262,4,0,shas3,,,"The key problem with schools is that they teach you to not just respect authority, but also to defer to it. In the real world, conforming and deferring to authority only makes you mediocre. In order to succeed, one needs to develop the mental framework to question authority and challenge the status quo. The current schooling system, for the most part, does not encourage the development of such a mentality.<p>As someone who grew up in India, I am all the more sensitive to the role of authority. Thanks to massive density of population, weak economy, and cultural norms, Indian institutions promote the worst forms of deference to authority.  However, rather than culture, in countries like the US, the schooling system is the primary source for teaching people to conform to their peers&#x27; expectations and to defer to authority. The American society, in general, is quite different from the hierarchical structure that exists in American schools. In the real world, you have more freedom to question authority. Life is also different for adults because they are often more mature than kids, and are in positions where they have more choice than in the school. Schools should thus change to mirror the society, while still understanding the fact that school students are mostly immature.<p>Often, such suggestions for reform are mistaken for &#x27;give them the choice to study what they want&#x27;. On the contrary, throughout secondary school, students should necessarily be taught all subjects and forced to sit through all classes. But, be careful to note that this does not necessarily imply that they should be <i>judged</i> on all these courses. The key problem in modern schools is that the &#x27;judgement&#x27; system is broken. Just like performance review systems in most companies. Schools should take a leaf out of the HR policies of companies like Netflix [1] and do away with formal judgement/performance review processes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr</a>",1393023420

7279977,comment,7279573,7279573,43,0,ChuckMcM,,,"And this is what you get when you have a designer &quot;imagine&quot; what a PC would look like.<p>One of the nice things about the Mac Pro was that it was <i>engineered</i> to look good, as opposed to being &quot;designed&quot; to look good. (or not depending on your design tastes).<p>The modern PC has three things you have to manage when engineering a &#x27;new&#x27; one, heat management from both the CPUs and the GPUs, signals management which can carry exceptionally high frequency signals across &quot;busses&quot; that act as transmission lines, and modularity.<p>This vision has the latter covered but introduces challenges that make keeping the other two in check probably impossible.<p>First (and perhaps foremost) a modern PC generates a lot of heat, and managing that heat is central to any design, like having a place to eat and a place to sleep are essential to any home design. The components will generate up to 1200W of heat (equivalent to a space heater or hair blow-dryer set on &#x27;high&#x27;) Which needs to be removed from the components fast enough to prevent them from reaching their critical temperature.<p>Next up, modern PCs use PCIe channels that clock at 5Ghz with low voltage differential signaling. These signals absolutely do <i>not</i> like going through connectors, so systems design need to minimize connector transitions to 1 or zero. The renders for this design seems to show components plugging into a back plane (minimum two connectors). Also at 5Ghz, the wavelength of these signals is 6 cm. That means that bits going through a wire that is longer than 6cm long start taking a &quot;long time&quot; (relative to the signal) to arrive. Now PCI has some mechanisms in the protocol to support this but it starts resulting in additional bus transactions and signals. That increases latency in a way that can turn your awesome GPU into something decidedly unawesome in terms of its performance. It isn&#x27;t the GPUs fault, its getting the data too and from the CPU which is the problem. There is a reason the &#x27;video&#x27; slot on PCs is the one right next to the processor :-). This problem is made even more manifest in memory systems. If you get a chance to look at the circuit board traces for memory DIMMs some time notice how some are really squiggly and some are straight. The trick is that they are all <i>exactly</i> the same length so that data that starts coming out of the chip arrives at the same time at the CPU and vice versa. Fully Buffered DIMMs (FBDIMMs) were a shot at &#x27;fixing&#x27; this and few people bought them. The chips ran hotter and performance was worse, lose lose to most consumers.<p>All that said, I love the <i>concept</i> of modularity in a PC but at the moment I can&#x27;t see how to get that without sacrificing a lot of performance. That is one of the reasons I was so impressed with Apple&#x27;s effort. It gets a lot of things right.",1393022872

7279969,comment,7278400,7278400,1,0,programminggeek,,,"No, it can&#x27;t. Haskell is not a prototyping language.<p>Ruby (and more generally dynamic languages like PHP/Python) are and Rails like frameworks are amazing tools for prototyping when you don&#x27;t know what you are building, need to iterate quickly, and need to prove out an idea. Dynamic languages are great for building things that are very dynamic, things that are in fact a kind of prototype.<p>Haskell and other languages with things like type checking and compilers and so on are designed to be safer, smarter, and are better long term for projects where the cost of complexity and maintenance are more significant and the development investment will get a payback.<p>If you don&#x27;t know if a project is going to work, you shouldn&#x27;t spend a huge investment to find out if it will work. So, use a tool like Wordpress, Drupal, Rails, Django, etc. to build out the minimum viable thing that you can build to prove out the idea and see if there is a real business there. Once you prove out the prototype and you know it is going to be a long term project that can pay for itself in terms of ongoing development investment, you need to throw the prototype away and build it with a tool like C#, Go, Java, Haskell, etc.<p>Most projects never realize they are no longer a prototype and should no longer be written in a prototyping language. Thus, you get all of the problems that come with a prototype without a lot of the solutions that we already have for solving them like compilers and such.<p>Interestingly, if you use a tool like Rails, there is enough there that you can get far past the point of a prototype before realizing it is no longer the right tool for the job. This is evidenced by the fact that there are now a ton of people talking about large project OOP and structure in Ruby and Rails, without them realizing that it&#x27;s always going to be an uphill battle in Ruby because of the language itself.<p>So, if the question is if Haskell can be the next great prototyping language, then I don&#x27;t think it is. If the question is if Haskell can be the language that you could migrate a project to after you realize it&#x27;s no longer a prototype, then yeah it might be.<p>Building a large production product with long term maintenance and scaling needs in a prototyping language is very likely a bad idea and is probably why there are so many projects that start to be really difficult in dynamic languages after they reach a certain size.",1393022735

For me, I had the advantage of perfect scores on a bunch of my standardized tests, so I had this other credential that would make people sit up and take notice.  My parents also advocated heavily for me, and I was not shy about befriending adults who I thought were more competent than my teachers and getting work/academic experience with them.  I&#x27;d taken college courses at 3 different schools before applying to college (acing all of them, and in one case doubling the class average), and I&#x27;d worked for a tech startup and done good work for them, so I had plenty of people willing to write recommendations for me.<p>The most important thing to realize if you&#x27;re faced with a roadblock (and probably in life in general) is that different people are impressed by different things.  You will never please everyone, but if there are <i>some</i> people who are impressed with you and willing to advocate for you, you can usually do an end-run around the people who think you will never amount to much.  It&#x27;s somewhat unfortunate that the public school system is packed with the sort of people who look at surface impressions only - think about what sort of people might be attracted to work at an institution where their own freedom to decide what to teach is itself set by bureaucrats sitting in the State House who have never gone near a classroom.  It&#x27;s doubly unfortunate that these are people in authority who have significant power over how our kids turn out.

We don&#x27;t have that as a major problem for our programming. If we did, I imagine I&#x27;d be interested in quantitative comparisons with other programming languages for similarly advanced code, (i.e. I wouldn&#x27;t want to read some ungodly shitfest alongside decent code as the argument that Erlang was better.)<p>To be convinced from that perspective, I&#x27;d have to:<p>A) Know ahead of time that we were going to be in a position where we&#x27;d need that sort of optimisation<p>B) Know, or strongly suspect, that we wouldn&#x27;t have to expend more effort learning Erlang than we would optimising it to &#x27;good enough&#x27; performance in another language.<p>C) Be assured that I&#x27;d be able to hire sufficiently intelligent programmers who knew, or were willing to learn, Erlang to maintain things if I set up in it.<p>That seems a rather niche position to be in requiring both a very strong pitch for that advantage on the part of Erlang, and a significant degree of foresight on my part. If it takes six months to a year to gear up for starting a decent Erlang solution, we&#x27;d best be expecting to do massive systems engineering fairly frequently as compared to writing the solution in something that we know right now for that to pay off.<p>People may say that it&#x27;s trivial to implement what&#x27;s missing in Erlang, as compared to the systems side of things that&#x27;s missing in some already known language. That may be true, I don&#x27;t pretend to know enough about it to comment on it. However, even if it&#x27;s so, is it sufficiently harder to implement something that scales out to the required efficiency in Known-Language-X than it is to learn Erlang to that level? Especially given that there&#x27;s probably already community support for scaling in Known-Language-X.<p>#<p>It does seem to have some other nice features. But from that perspective - and this was my first response on dipping into Learn You... I look at it and think <i>&#x27;This looks kinda like Haskell. Why not use Haskell?&#x27;</i> or, as the case may be, <i>&#x27;Why not Lisp?&#x27;</i> Both of which I&#x27;ve some experience with and would be easier to find good programmers for.<p>In that regard Erlang is competing with some damn powerful languages.",1393021320

It would be much better if the problem being solved to create a blockchain were also useful in some other context, eg protein folding. Of course, some such problems are handled better than others by computers; protein folding is something that humans seem to do well but for which we haven&#x27;t managed to develop great algorithms yet.<p>But if part of the work can be done in the human brain rather than in a CPU/GPU/ASIC, is that bad? The current computation model basically means that mining rewards go to whoever invests the most capital, ie has money to throw at the problem. This is inherently inequitable, because it means people with more money or a willingness to appropriate the equipment of others will mine/dig/discover more coin. Of course, the argument is that since mining is rather random, in theory you can start mining on your small CPU tomorrow and hit some coin, or get a random amount of coin for a fixed amount of mining. But random rewards devalue expertise and experience in favor of an unnaturally even probability distribution.

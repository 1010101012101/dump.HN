And, moreover, doing it using the exact opposite way as proposed by European social democracies (China has economic freedom without political openness, while France, for instance, has the opposite)<p>But for anyone coming here in China, from Westerners to Indians to Africans, there is this stone-hard fact: it works, it is happening and it works. In China, they actually have highways all over, they build new factories everyday, they grab millions of peasants out of poverty every year. This process has a lot of difficulties, yes, but who would hope it wouldn't?<p>So the real estate bubble fear: I can only talk about what I know, and what I have seen. I was in Chengdu for 3 years. An enormous percentage of the city center is actually owned by the local government. Same thing in Beijing, where I have lived for 6 years: in my street the local government did order renovation for all places it is owning during the post-olympic little depression (just a ""post coitum anima triste""), so it was very clear: they own half of the hutong street. In Kunming, nearly half of the city is a University. What I mean is that, contrary to many Western govs, Chinese gov still has a strong leverage on real estate. They are already reacting in real time to stabilize the market.<p>So, sorry to tell you that, but your eruption feels a bit ill-grounded.",1326195691

Needless to say I thought I would understand in higher grades and after high school I thought may be I can connect the dots in college.<p>It did help in college but some of the little things I still connect. I have a degree in CS and I am pursuing my masters now. It's amazing how even now I connect those little dots and get my aha moments. What is surprising is that Ive come to realize that with a little help I could've made such simple connections even when I was 10 (when I first learnt the concept of Light) or in high school (when Bayes theorem was nothing but a magical formula) rather I was shunned by saying you have a long way to go.<p>I always wished someone saw the passion I had for solving geometric problems (i was helping higher grade students solve cirlces theorems when I was 12) and gave me a direction. Heck I bumped into Euclids Elements like a year ago. In fact, I remember people suggesting me to leave geometry coz its useless. Everything starting from computational geometry, probability to number theory I do today is aided by those geometrical figures I played with.<p>I really got carried away there, but coming back to the video, I think the video captures one of the essential elements of education which is to make that connection from time to time with simple examples. It all boils down to people who can do that, who has a liking to the workings of all things around them, who have open and inquisitive mind, who likes to see students realize those aha moments, who are true teachers.",1326194428

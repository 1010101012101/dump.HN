9143170,comment,9142819,9142819,0,0,matthewmacleod,,,"Rewriting a monolithic platform as a set of microservices will almost always result in improvements from every perspective. You&#x27;re replacing legacy code with new, cruft-free code; you&#x27;re de-coupling parts of the system; you&#x27;re building a more scalable design.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re in the situation where you&#x27;ve gone from 12GB to 5MB of memory consumption, then you have a design issue and not a language one. That&#x27;s not Ruby&#x27;s fault.<p>We are also in the process of converting several monoliths into a microservice-driven system, but we are doing so with Ruby. It remains great language to use for building web apps, and I suspect some of the push back against it is caused by a dislike of the cliché giant Rails monolith that we&#x27;ve all come across, with hundreds of gem dependencies and so on. Rubby and Rails have a habit of encouraging such bad designs primarily through ease of use, but it&#x27;s hard to see that as a problem with Ruby.<p>Go is a good tool for doing the same, and single-binary deployment is pretty magic. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be supported for ages, so if you want to re-tool to use that then go for it! But Ruby&#x27;s a viable option too, and it&#x27;s important not to place blame for bad app design in the wrong place.",1425455323

9143149,comment,9142771,9143077,0,0,wtallis,,,"The questions are about the C language, not any particular implementation thereof. Question 2 requires you to know that different compilers may at times legally do different things with the same piece of code. Answering question 2 does not require you to know <i>which</i> compiler is in use. Instead it requires you to think in the mindset of someone trying to write portable code that will work as intended with <i>any</i> compliant compiler.<p>In this case, the code is invalid because it invokes undefined behavior, and the compiler is allowed to do literally anything. The author of a portable C program is not allowed to rely on any particular behavior. I don&#x27;t have any of the ISO C standards docs handy, but I&#x27;m quite certain that they all agree here. The (probably hypothetical) compiler in use here is apparently trying to apply several heuristics that are useful in other situations but fail here because there is no right answer.<p>In general, the C standards avoid requiring a specific behavior where choosing to require a specific behavior could hurt portability. Most C compilers make use of their leeway to interpret things in a manner that helps make bad code run and many compilers make promises beyond those required by the standard to aid in writing non-portable code.",1425454792

Everything is an object, every method call is a message send that follows the exact same protocol of dispatch. Also, completely irrelevant to the main thrust of the article.<p>2) Memory consumption and speed:\nCan&#x27;t really refute anything since by their own admission they were running a monolithic system.<p>3) Concurrency:\nPlenty of options. I like celluloid personally and if you switch to JRuby then you can do all sorts of other stuff as well with automatically managed thread pools.<p>4) Backcompat:\nRuby is not an enterprise ecosystem. Some people call that speed and agility. In their case they really should have gone with Java since they are basically serving an enterprise customer. This is not a knock on Java. I think the language and its ecosystem is by design made for stuff like this.<p>5) PDF generation:\nI&#x27;m guessing the Ruby code was calling some C library to do the rendering and they swapped out all of it for Go. I don&#x27;t know what library Go is using to render PDFs if it is the same library then there is something interesting happening here. If it is a different library then they are comparing apples and oranges and there&#x27;s nothing to see here.<p>6) Alert service:\nCompletely bound by I/O so doesn&#x27;t matter what language you use. Bad design for keeping many processes around because you only need to spin them up during spikey times which can be easily handled with better engineering. Also eventmachine and celluloid for the worker internals would have been another option so again they didn&#x27;t do their research.<p>7) Gradebook service:\nNo idea again. Thin on details so nothing to refute really.<p>8) Deployment:\nSure. Why not. Single binary is easier or JRuby and a single jar which is just as easy.<p>In conclusion, they re-wrote everything and I&#x27;m sure removed a lot of cruft in the process and called it a victory for Go.

That&#x27;s fine, but then care should be taken that one does not vacillate between that position and claiming that no one has ever shown any evidence of supernatural phenomena. Anyway, the latter point is a bit of a nit, but I&#x27;ve seen armchair skeptics make the mistake often enough that it bears pointing out.<p>In my own life, I have on several occasions observed or experienced some phenomena which seemed to defy laws of nature. With respect to the demonic, I can relate one such experience, from which I must necessarily omit certain details so as to not betray anyone&#x27;s privacy:<p>Several years ago, I met someone whom I will refer to as &quot;Jim&quot;. Jim suffered from serious mental illness and had been unable to develop an awareness that he had a problem for which medical treatment was necessary (and readily available). I tried to be a good friend, but Jim&#x27;s life was upside down and he regularly got into (sometimes serious) trouble with local law enforcement. I visited him and picked him up from the county jail on several occasions over the years. As I got to know Jim better, I also discovered he had something of an obsession with &quot;the devil&quot; and demons, as well angels and manual copying of long portions of the Christian Bible.<p>One evening, Jim seemed to be struggling with an intense episode of paranoia and I went to visit him at his request. Upon entering his apartment, I felt that something was... wrong, very wrong. I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out what it was, but then Jim spontaneously began to verbally relate knowledge of events in my life which were in no way recorded in digital or physical media (Facebook, paper trash, etc.) – private things, secret things, spanning years before I met Jim (and in precise form) of which I had never spoken. It began with one sudden statement, which startled me, which reaction elicited a pained laugh from Jim. He then proceeded to relate more &quot;secret knowledge&quot;. His intense gaze (at me) and manner of speech throughout seemed &quot;detached&quot; from the world around him... for just a moment I was genuinely frightened. I said a silent prayer, abruptly changed the subject, and then hurried him out the door so we could go get a late dinner and coffee. Later conversations with Jim suggested that he didn&#x27;t recall the incident; I&#x27;ve never asked him how he knew those things. Sadly, Jim disappared some time later, after a failed intervention to get him medical help. If he&#x27;s still alive, I hope a couple of things for Jim. One, that he will realize he needs medical help to deal with his mental illness, and will avail himself of it. Two, that if he is under demonic influence, then he will meet with a kind soul who is able to help deliver him. I have spoken with a real-life exorcist – I didn&#x27;t seek him out, I met him in passing – and was told that my experience with Jim was a possible sign of demonic activity though not necessarily possession.<p>Please note that my relating the above is not my way of &quot;pounding the table&quot; to insist that demons are real. It&#x27;s a very personal and unexaggerated anecdote offered, for what it&#x27;s worth, in relation to the idea that exorcisms and experience of the demonic would somehow always relate to &quot;internal&quot; phenomena.",1425453185

On the one hand, by interpreting the law absurdly broadly, you expand your own authority until some check-and-balance comes along and pushes you back in line, which could very well be never. On the other hand, the more you push the boundaries, the less you can focus on where the real problems are. An agency which can&#x27;t evaluate a situation like this, and in an hour walk away with a &#x27;Have a nice day,&#x27; is a <i>broken</i> agency. The bar must be higher than this.<p>Kids are incredibly safe in these neighborhoods, and the more kids that are out, the safer it gets. We need to be encouraging this behavior, not apply some seriously chilling effect. What can be more chilling than the threat of taking away the kids?!<p>The idea that this could reach to that level is I think the worst part of the whole ordeal. This is so far removed from &#x27;<i>we need to get the kids out of here</i>&#x27; it is absolutely ridiculous that could even come up.<p>But I think, again, it&#x27;s about the state trying to maintain &#x27;easy access&#x27; to their biggest weapon, so they can use it easily when they need to. I think what there needs to be is a bright line test which assures parents their kids are not at immanent risk of being seized by the fucking state. For this, I think the answer is simple, you cannot ever remove children, you can merely arrest the parents. If you can&#x27;t legally arrest the parents, then you shouldn&#x27;t be taking the kids. I can&#x27;t even imagine how traumatic that must be.<p>I mean... if I was actually working at an agency like this, if I got a call about those kids walking on their own with multiple residents calling the police, the reasonable thing to do is first establish the parents knew where the kids were, and then second ask a few basic questions of the kids, and see if the eldest knows the right answers. It&#x27;s really no different than if you encounter a park ranger, some of the questions they might ask you to ensure you are safe. We/They are there <i>for your protection</i>.

In a world where using someone&#x27;s library typically requires one or more of (a) having everyone compiling your code also manually compile the library, (b) hoping the library has found its way into N different OS package managers, and (c) vendoring requiring manual maintenance, you end up with a lot of real world C and C++ code reimplementing basic things that would be better done in a library, because importing a library is too much work.  This sucks - certainly it&#x27;s possible for libraries to be too small, dependency graphs too convoluted, and you can see some of that on npm, but C/C++ are so far on the other end of the spectrum that it&#x27;s hardly worth thinking of.",1425452900

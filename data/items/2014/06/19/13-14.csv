There&#x27;s no moral reason whatsoever why people in one patch of land deserve jobs and people in some other patch don&#x27;t.<p>The enemy is the commoditization of programming talent (and on adverse terms; I&#x27;d be happy to be commoditized at a rate near what I&#x27;m actually worth) and the attitude that we&#x27;re just cost centers to be squeezed and trimmed, and the fact that when this approach backfires (the cheapest programmers, anywhere in the world, produce shitty code) it&#x27;s not management but engineers who have to clean up the mess. Management gets promotions, engineers get legacy code. That&#x27;s the evil. It doesn&#x27;t matter, morally speaking, if it&#x27;s a shitty outsourcing shop in India or California. Likewise, if it profits you (and the programmer) to hire top talent in California or in India, you should do so.<p>The technical term for this is <i>labor arbitrage</i>. When a company spots a true labor arbitrage (a chance to profit by outsourcing work to a cheaper country) it has the right to use it. I don&#x27;t think anyone disputes that. As Omar Little says, it&#x27;s all in the game.<p>But if it&#x27;s a legitimate move for a company, it&#x27;s also a legitimate move for an employee. This person spotted a labor arbitrage and took the spread for himself. Unless he compromised classified information (then I feel differently about the whole matter) good for him. If his employer spotted a labor arbitrage (i.e. that his job could be outsourced) they would take the profit all for themselves, and he&#x27;d be out of a job. He spotted it first, and he got the profit.",1403186377

From my experiences developing parallel versions of C++ and Java, most of my Java errors arose from program logic, while C++ arose from memory management.

Ah, Brazil according to your bio on your site). The first thing I&#x27;d do in your position is move to a country with a proper public health care system - probably the UK.<p>Do it via finding a job or any other method, but somehow do it. The startup itself doesn&#x27;t matter. You write &quot;I have a great responsability&quot; - yes, you do, you have a great responsibility to yourself to take care of your health. In terms of order of magnitude, the responsibility to the startup is a 1000x less. Fuck the startup, health comes first. And if fixing your health requires moving to a different country and canning the startup, do it.<p>Thats perhaps the most important thing you should take away from this: your priorities are all screwed up.

7916057,comment,7915782,7915782,8,0,bithush,,,"Your health should always be your number one priority. You can always do another start up. You can always earn more money. What you can&#x27;t do is get back your time and your health back.<p>It is a very difficult thing to do but you need to look at yourself and honestly answer this question: If I don&#x27;t put my health in the number one spot where will I be in a year? 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?<p>If this were a technical problem with your game you would search for a solution. Do the same for your health!<p>You did not say where you live other than it is winter so the southern hemisphere. I am going to guess an Asian or South American country from your comments about restricted health care and lack of safe place to exercise. Please correct if I am wrong.<p>You need to get this shit sorted though. Even if that means ditching your start up and getting a regular job. You said you had a higher paying job before your degree? Can you go back to that job or similar? Do you get any kind of private healthcare with such a job?<p>I know you are in a financially difficult position but every penny you put into anything but your health is almost certainly a penny wrongly spent at the moment. Yes you might get lucky and hit gold and have all the money you need to get better but you can&#x27;t bet your health on a hail Mary like that. You said you are young? If so you have a lot of life left (if you sort your health out) to do a start-up. Maybe now is not the right time. A start up is killer even for someone in excellent health so doing one in poor health is almost a guarantee for disaster.<p>If I were in your position I would do the following<p>* Research everything you can about your specific thyroid problem. Get as much information as you can about it from your doctor and search the hell out of it. Treat it like a bug and research, research, research!<p>* Use your research to find the right drugs and then look at how to source them. There is loads of solid, medical advice on free resources online such as the NHS websites which you should be able to access without any problem. Getting the medicine may be the hardest part but thyroid medication should not be all that hard to get as it is not a controlled substance as far as I am aware (I could be wrong where you live obviously).<p>* Get your diet sorted. Have a consistent meal and exercise plan. Weight loss is more about diet than exercise so eat right. You said you can lose weight but put it back on quickly. That is normal! A solid, prolonged change to your diet will keep the weight coming off and staying off. I know the thyroid problem makes this harder but it has to be done.<p>* Find somewhere you can exercise. There will be somewhere unless you really do live in an awful place.<p>* Look online for cheap glasses or contact lenses. You can get very cheap glasses these days.<p>* How much will a dentist cost? Look at your finances and work out how long it will take you to safe for the treatment.<p>* Have you got family or friends who can help you? Maybe you could live with friends to reduce rent costs? Do some simple work freelance?<p>I hope that helps a bit. I really can&#x27;t stress just how much your health is the most important thing though. Excuse my language but fuck your start up if you are not healthy. There is nothing to gain from having a successful start-up if you are in poor health and cannot enjoy the success. You need to have a seriously look at your priorities and if a start-up is the right thing for you right now.",1403186119

7916054,comment,7914661,7914661,2,0,netcan,,,"There are analogies and then there are analogies.<p>One very common type is of the talk is cheap variety. Management can declare their company to be a team or a family or an enchanted kingdom. They read about it in Harvard Review. Like a mission statement or a slogan , these thing only mean something when you put your money (literally and figuratively) where your mouth is. Most don&#x27;t.<p>The second type is a half hearted analogy. The company really intends to be like a team, a family or a special forces unit. But, the cost to really making that mean a lot is high. You can make the business somewhat family like or team like relatively cheaply and inform your company culture, but there are going to be countess cases where the cost is high. FO employees to really buy into it, they need to accept this costs. Most don&#x27;t. What they have is rhetoric and a certain amount of investment into team building. Fair enough, but not what this article is decribing<p>The type of team like environment the article is describing doesn&#x27;t come cheap? You need to have good feedback & measurement mechanisms for performance on the team level. You need success and failure to be very well compensated for and it needs to be based on team performance. Are you compensating success well enough that members of the team will want to see the poorest performers periodically replaced?<p>A professional sports team is an exceptional environment. The people there are high achievers and they are ambitious. They are the 1%, most hardworking <i>and</i> talented. They get a lot of money and a lot of glory. They&#x27;re in &#x27;once in a hundred lifetimes&#x27; state of mind. Can your company offer that? Is 5 years of success on you &quot;team&quot; the pinnacle of a career? Are they making more now than they ever will be? Will these be the glory years they relive?<p>Functions with very straightforward feedback, like sales tend to develop these dynamics with the right compensation structure. A small startup with only a handful of high equity employees can develop this culture naturally. Trying to artificially create it elsewhere is hard. I also suspect it&#x27;s near impossible a group with over 50 or so people.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say this stuff. Does Netflix really put this into practice? Does anyone?",1403186073

For that to really be the case though the computer&#x27;s reply would have to actually be a joke.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s time, given people are claiming they&#x27;ve passed the Turing test on dubious grounds for media attention, that a new test is established based on whether the computer can tell a funny joke. Higher level comedy plays with meaning and context, thus to make a joke you have to display mastery over the possible meanings as well as building a mental model of how your interlocutor will process it. Thus a being that can tell a joke is displaying a distinct sophistication. Many humans might fail that one though.",1403185821

I was really taken aback, because I could not remember <i>any</i> instance of being rude to him.<p>He explained that he thought so because I apparently &quot;always&quot; raised objections when he came up with an idea, while I&#x27;d let dumb ideas from [other employee] slide. But eventually he&#x27;d accepted that my input tended to be right, and had come to understand that I didn&#x27;t mean anything with it.<p>It dawned on me what the problem was: I let the dumb ideas from [other employee] slide, because I knew everyone recognised how unworkable they were. I wasn&#x27;t trying to be nice - I was just not wasting my energy on it; let someone else shoot it down and move on.<p>But this guy often had quite good ideas, that I <i>liked</i>. So with total blindness to how it came across, I tore into them to weed out potential problems. To me, these ideas had merit, and needed to be given careful consideration, either so we had good reason if we rejected them, or to make sure we refined them into the best we could do.<p>But what I communicated was a stream of seemingly hostile arguments, because I did not realise that he needed acknowledgment that the idea was worthwhile and good; to me that was implicit: It was why I found it worthwhile talking about it.<p>So often, the difference between coming across as an opinionated jerk and a nice guy who stands up for his opinions is down to making people feel like you appreciate their input and listen carefully, and that you are negotiating a solution with them rather than just hammering through your own viewpoints, even if the end point ends up being essentially the same.<p>>  negotiations with what he wanted. Everyone in the company highly respects him for it and everyone is better off because of it.<p>People <i>love</i> a strong negotiator, because a negotiation gives people a feeling of stake in the outcome. Someone who is recognisably a strong negotiator is often admired even when you come up against them and know logically you&#x27;re getting a worse deal than you could have, because a good negotiation is about making the other side feel like it&#x27;s a genuine give and take, and that you are being listened to (hopefully it is true as well...).<p>It comes naturally to people. My son often tries to negotiate his bedtime, and we try to accommodate that as much as possible, because we know from experience that when we negotiate from a starting point we set, he ends up going to bed earlier than he otherwise would, and does so happily and without protest, seemingly triumphant because he put in effort on it and got us to yield a bit on our starting position. When we negotiate a time, he&#x27;ll even remind us when it is time to get him ready for bed, if we don&#x27;t notice the time.",1403185297
7915975,comment,7915748,7915877,14,0,personZ,,,"<i>I wonder, have we really pushed relational databases to their breaking point?</i><p>The primary limitation of relational databases were traditionally that without expert level optimizations (which, realistically, data-focused organizations should have. But they very seldom do, especially in the start-up space), many queries would generate large numbers of effectively random IO. When you&#x27;re rolling with magnetic drives, each drive offers maybe 60-150 IOPS, so this quickly becomes an enormous scaling problem. A large storage array offered maybe 2000 IOPS. Scaling becomes entirely about scaling IOPS, as CPU is seldom a limitation in databases.<p>Add that many firms were starting on EC2 which not only gave you minimal memory, it offered absolutely miserable IOPS performance.<p>Digg famously, and disastrously, solved this problem by essentially &quot;denormalizing&quot; every bit of data, enormously exploding the raw data they stored, but allowing for individual queries to be entirely localized, often served in a single, large IO: Instead of looking up all of your friends and finding the things they dug, the system would push every bit of data proactively to containers for every possible user. This is the model promoted by many advocates of alternative storage (e.g the advantage of MongoDb is always the &quot;pull a single giant data bag versus pulling it together from various places&quot;).<p>If Kevin Rose dug something, it would update the &quot;things my friends liked&quot; containers for 40,000 or so of his friends, rather than having those 40,000 users check on-demand to see what each of their friends liked.<p>But they did that right when flash storage was coming into the mainstream. A technology that offers, on simple, inexpensive cards, 100s of thousands to millions of IOPS. Add that RAM has exploded, such that servers with 256GB of memory are very affordable (that was enough to put the entire universe of Digg&#x27;s data in memory, where of course random IO is in the tens to hundreds of millions).<p>So now we&#x27;re at a situation where having non-duplicated, highly relational database is often the highest performance, outside of all of its other advantages, because it fits in memory, and fits on economical flash storage.

You&#x27;ve solved a lot of the &quot;technical&quot; HTML and CSS challenges — but the design and UX totally melts down at smaller screen sizes, and on devices that are touch-only (try figuring out what those nine menu icons mean without hover events).<p>Ultimately, there&#x27;s a lot more to being &quot;responsive&quot; than basic UI acceptance testing on a range of devices. You have to do proper cross-device user testing to see if people can figure out how to move through your interface fluidly. If they can&#x27;t, you need to redesign certain aspects of your UI.<p>There&#x27;s also a strong argument in many cases for not going responsive at all. If your &quot;phone&quot; and &quot;desktop&quot; use cases don&#x27;t line up well, you may be looking at a situation where an m. site (what is this, 2003?) is actually more appropriate. That way, you can serve a UI specifically optimized to the tasks your users are likely to be performing on a smaller screen.<p>tl;dr: &quot;Responsiveness&quot; is a UX problem as much as it is a technical problem. Don&#x27;t ignore the user-facing side of the equation.<p>Addendum: regarding point 6, &quot;Learn about how responsive design works before you start&quot; — you&#x27;re confusing learning responsive design with learning how to use Bootstrap. To actually learn responsive design from scratch, a good place to start is Ethan Marcotte&#x27;s classic Responsive Web Design: <a href=""http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design</a>",1403183051

The first time the C-level staff came for an all-hands meeting was a strange experience.<p>The Americans were smiley and happy and joking around in the front of the large meeting room... I think I&#x27;m becoming more European because I felt like they looked like idiots (idiot in the literal sense). The Europeans (about 100) were quiet as they usually are in meetings - some polite chuckles when an American would tell a joke during his talk, but they were getting frustrated at how long the Americans were taking to get to the point.<p>I spoke with one of the C-level staff afterwards and I had to assure him that the Europeans weren&#x27;t upset about the takeover - most of us were happy for it. The Europeans were just more serious and respectful than the Americans were used to.",1403183018

I&#x27;m generally in the spaces camp myself, and believe that 3.4MB just isn&#x27;t worth worrying about any more (despite being worth ten of the floppies that were omnipresent even several years into my career), but it&#x27;s still a surprisingly high number.",1403182843

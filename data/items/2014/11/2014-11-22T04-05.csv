8644788,comment,8644554,8644743,0,0,userbinator,,,"<i>would be offset by bugs in the software or unanticipated situations</i><p>Indeed, it&#x27;s always the &quot;unanticipated situations&quot; that cause problems both for humans and computers - and in the case of flying, I think it&#x27;s better to have some level of automation to reduce human error, but there must always be a manual override. Completely replacing the pilot with innumerable lines of code executed by a computer would be even more dangerous as it&#x27;s far more likely that a pilot can react intelligently to assess the situation and take manual control of the plane than someone be able to immediately find the bug and fix it, without introducing any new ones, then update the software &quot;on-the-fly&quot; (literally).<p>It&#x27;s similar to the issues that abstractions cause in software: the more we rely on them to hide details, and the more complex the systems we build as a result, the harder it is to reason about the problems that arise due to something lower down in the stack. &quot;Out of sight, out of mind.&quot;<p>Here is a related article about this: <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/automated-to-death"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/automated-to-dea...</a>",1416632304

8644782,comment,8644554,8644554,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I do not know how I feel about this. I realise that a modern day plane basically flies itself once it reaches cruise altitude what is referred to as fly-by-wire. However, the notion that pilots are not needed or do nothing on planes is ridiculous.<p>Are we forgetting that it was a pilot in 2009 on US Airways Flight 1549 that safely landed the plane after striking a flock of geese during its initial climbout only to be ditched into the Hudson River shortly after. If a pilot was not in the plane at the time, no computer would have been able to save the plane.<p>Typically a pilot will turn off the autopilot around 1000 feet and then do the rest for descent and subsequent landing. On takeoff, most pilots will fly to around 10,000 feet, some to cruise altitude before turning on the autopilot. There are some tasks on modern day planes that cannot be currently done without a pilot (at least not safely).<p>We have to remember things like autopilot still require manual input from the pilot and cockpit crew to get from its departure point to its destination. A pilot doesn&#x27;t just fly a plane out of an airport, press a couple of buttons and then do nothing for the rest of the flight, this is a misconception perpetrated by the media and so-called experts who have never flown a plane in their life. Autopilot is merely a tool, much like a machine keeping a patient breathing and their blood flowing in the operating theatre is a tool for surgeons. The machines need to be calibrated, have their data input and be closely monitored much like a pilot does on a plane, even with autopilot engaged.<p>While I applaud the forward thinking from people like Steve Jurvetson, statements like &quot;<i>Planes are mostly already flown on autopilot already</i>&quot; would be strongly disagreed with any pilot you ask. No two flights are the same and all flights are made up of individual and manual decisions from the pilot and crew. If a pilotless plane were something that could be a reality, the airline industry which has been struggling for years now to keep costs down amidst rising fuel costs would have already partially integrated this or started to cut down on the number of pilots they hire.<p>I would like to see a pilotless plane decide what to do when the landing gear fails and an emergency landing needs to be made. I would like to see what happens when a tire blows on a high-speed take off and the plane has to make an emergency landing, or what happens when a plane has to make an emergency detour over rocky terrain.<p>You would still need people to operate these planes remotely, what happens when contact is lost with a plane and it finds itself flying without a pilot at 35,000 feet who can manually take control of the plane and land it? Is Steve forgetting that a pilot would effectively be replaced with someone in a call centre type building sitting at a computer terminal remotely programming commands and programming things like runway codes and other things into the plane?<p>Some things just can&#x27;t and should never be replaced. Is modern day technology meant to replace doctors? Every time a new device intended to help keep a patient alive is created, is its intent to aide or replace a doctor? Of course not. People would never agree with replacing doctors with machines completely.<p>Looking to eliminate drivers on the ground is one thing, because ground transportation is far more dangerous than air transportation. I agree with driverless cars because we already have the data and vehicle trips thanks to mapping data and technology mean they are predictable to a certain degree. Air travel is the safest kind of travel there is, fatalities and accidents have been consistently going down year after year, the number of accidents with fatalities in the last 10 years on Western commercial airlines can be counted with both hands.<p>Replacing pilots in commercial aircraft is something that will not happen in my lifetime, or perhaps ever. It is one of the worst ideas I have ever heard. Not everything can or should be automated for the sake of automating them.",1416632135

8644779,comment,8644067,8644407,0,0,darkmighty,,,"This is my quibble against WoW and the like. I had a lot of growth experiences in a much more brutal environment, a game called Tibia. I haven&#x27;t heard any MMO as unforgiving, specially in it&#x27;s early days. A single death costs you about 15% of your <i>total</i> play time (you lose items, experience, all there is to lose basically). Killing someone usually held a profit.<p>As a kid, it meant you would play hours and hours and get beaten repeatedly. You&#x27;d lose everything and then you&#x27;d have to find motivation to do better next time. You would find friends and nurture relationships because you needed and later because you found you really enjoyed them. Eventually, you would find you can kill for fun and profit, completely destroying weeks or months of a fellow player. It&#x27;s a sort of Bottom-Up introduction on how civilizations form, because some time you realize the instabilities associated with violence (or, depending on your personality, just compassion from your repeated deaths). Protection networks formed -- killing someone might get you hunted. Guilds were the next step in this protection network, with huge political intricacies such as necessity of protecting some members which may or may not be in a morally justifiable position to  maintain the position of power of the Guild.<p>I could go on. Some of the smartest people I know and many of my best friends played the game in their youth; I wouldn&#x27;t say it made who they are, but if it didn&#x27;t it surely provided an amazing opportunity to learn some thing you don&#x27;t really do until a much later age, if ever.",1416631931
8644778,comment,8644478,8644478,0,0,baddox,,,"What an astonishingly vapid and frustrating article. We need to get past these semantic arguments about what constitutes &quot;intelligence.&quot; The &quot;do submarines swim&quot; analogy is cliched, but perfectly appropriate. It doesn&#x27;t matter how you define &quot;swim.&quot; Submarines are better at certain tasks than human bodies on their own. Likewise, computer systems that we label &quot;AI&quot; systems are better at certain tasks than human bodies (brains) on their own.<p>The author seems to use &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;autonomy&quot; interchangeably, which is troubling, mostly because he makes no attempt at actually defining either. His claim that amoebas and plants &quot;exhibit an intelligence, an autonomy, an originality, that far outstrips even the most powerful computers&quot; is ludicrous under any remotely plausible definitions of the terms. If humans genetically engineer an amoeba or a plant to change its behavior, is the magical &quot;autonomy&quot; suddenly gone?<p>Also, his argument is ridiculous even as semantic arguments go, since &quot;artificial&quot; isn&#x27;t <i>supposed</i> to mean &quot;synthetic.&quot; The standard dictionary definitions are &quot;made by humans&quot; and &quot;false or pretending.&quot;",1416631917

Emanuel Derman often writes about this problem, and it is something I have observed very frequently at workplaces - this present generation seems to be obsessed with meta-knowledge rather than actual knowledge. He points out its better to know a few things but know them indepth, rather than have an ability to talk about everything without actually knowing what those things really are. When I ask people to implement ordinary least squares from scratch, literally like 5% of the people interviewed manage to do that, & they are very, very good. The remaining 95% &quot;know about ols&quot; but don&#x27;t &quot;know ols&quot; ie. they will give me lots of mumbo jumbo about how ols is the building block of statistics & how it is affected by outliers & so forth - but can&#x27;t implement one to save their lives. When it comes to sorting, I vastly prefer somebody who can implement atleast one of O(n) ( postman sort), O(n^2) ( bubblesort) or O(nlogn) ( mergesort, several others ) rather than somebody who can give me all this context & then say I will google the actual algorithm.

A loooong time ago when I was still in engineering I worked for Big Corp, Inc. and they had a designation for master technical talent, I forget the name, so let&#x27;s just call them Jedi Masters.  It was a non-management path for those who didn&#x27;t want to go the management route but it recognized their value to the company.  If you reached this level you had no manager and had no assigned work but people from other projects could come to them for advice, help, consultation, etc. and they could choose what they wanted to work on.<p>Often the Jedi Masters were tapped to teach intro engineering course to new engineers on the specifics of the type of projects this company worked on, so this was a quasi-academic and quasi-consulting gig for the best of the best engineers.<p>As a fairly new engineer, I got assigned to a new group and invited to a meeting that could impact the system I was working on.  I show up and it is a meeting with an engineering partner (outside company) that was contesting some calcs regarding the pipe strength and mounting requirements for an installation (multi-billion dollar project). Their engineering team was insisting on assumptions that would have quadrupled the cost of a system that our group was responsible for, not to mention weeks or months of delays to recalc and redesign the system. Unbeknownst to me, this dispute had been at logger heads for months with no resolution.<p>One of the Jedi&#x27;s, let&#x27;s just call him Fred, taught me years before in the intro courses and I had remained in contact with him over time. Based on the courses Fred taught I thought he might have the expertise and interest in this area to take a look at this problem so I met with him and gave him the technical details.  He agreed to attend the next meeting and advise but he made me do all the calcs, presentation and etc. for the next meeting but all under his guidance.  So I go through my PPT presentation and at the end the other company&#x27;s engineers have all sorts of objections, disagreements, etc. So our Jedi steps in and starts fielding questions and asks them to justify their position. It turns out that their reference text they were using to justify their position was actually written by Fred! I can still hear the other engineer say, &quot;you mean you are Fred XYZ that wrote book ABC&quot; with awe and respect in his voice. It turns out they were missing some important exceptions and qualifications later in the book that Fred cited and the meeting and conflict was resolved.<p>So the moral of the story is to always have a Jedi in your corner? No.<p>The moral of the story is that engineers and problem solvers (and I assume coders) have different motivation than the &quot;success&quot; of big, showy career managing a lot of people. We (technical people) love to solve problems and management is projecting their values onto technical people when they offer them management positions as &quot;promotions&quot;.",1416629174

Those opportunities exist (in quantity!) in real life, but may not in any given MBA program.",1416628853

The story is talking about Xfinity retail plans.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to compare retail prices to wholesale prices. If an average coder can&#x27;t even get bandwidth at $0.001/GB with some serious effort, then how this this a valid point of comparison for how much bandwidth should cost for the average internet user?<p>I doubt you can get Level3 or Internap to beat HE prices.",1416628852

10177985,comment,10176642,10177870,0,0,dalke,,,"&quot;I think we&#x27;d probably see that the internet is a far more sustainable, cheaper medium through which to transfer information.&quot;<p>Absolutely true. Yet not that relevant. Data transfer cost isn&#x27;t a major factor.<p>The journals in my fields are all electronic. They no longer have paper distributions. As a result, the library no longer needs to store a physical copy, and people can retrieve a copy from their office instead of spending the hour to so to find it in the library and photocopy it.<p>Great savings, right?<p>This also means that the publisher, as copyright holder, can enforce access restrictions. For example, I (as the member of the public) can use the chemistry library of a large university about an hour away to get online access to some of these journals, without paying an extra fee. However, I am not allowed to print or make copies of these articles. Once upon a time, when everything was in paper, there was no way for the publisher to make that restriction. Precisely because information transfer is cheaper, it&#x27;s now possible for the publisher to have more fine-grained control.<p>As a result, ILL services have gotten worse. The rise of internet-based document retrieval services with limits on public (non-student/non-staff) access has meant that modern library users may need to travel more now, in order to visit a library with a given journal subscription, than 25 years ago, when an ILL request would have been possible.<p>See <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/how-copyright-laws-prevent-easy-sharing-of-e-books-a-961333.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/how-copyright-...</a> for &quot;The Digital Paradox: How Copyright Laws Keep E-Books Locked Up.&quot; Quoting from it:<p>> If a student in Freiburg wants to read the hard-copy version of a book from the university library in Basel, he or she can simply order it via an interlibrary loan. But if only an electronic version is available, interlibrary loans are generally not an option. The student has no choice but to climb into a train and head to Switzerland to read the book on a university computer.<p>This sounds like the European version of the scenario you presented, only it was solved with the &#x27;quite dated&#x27; ILL system, and exists with e-books.<p>In passing you highlighted the underlying reason. The publishing companies would like it if the laws and technology were set up so that making a copy of a journal article at a library is &quot;piracy&quot; (I prefer the term &#x27;copyright infringement&#x27;), unless they get paid for making the copy, and they as copyright holders should be in charge of determining what the price is. (The ILL system addressed copyright payments through RAND-like copyright clearance agreements.)<p>Technology which makes it easier for copyright holders to control their copyright makes it harder for people to use the same materials. Either worthy people without the funds can&#x27;t get access to a paper or there is &#x27;rampant piracy&#x27;.",1441555153

How long did the design process take and do you find it helps you maintain healthy typing habits?<p>As for the &#x27;cool&#x27; aspects of the Soli, I really could care less.  (I&#x27;ve never cared about &#x27;cool&#x27;/&#x27;hip&#x27;/&#x27;meme&#x27; things.)<p><i>I simply think the Soli, or other projects like it, will actually open up many, very different avenues to resolve tactile input needs.</i><p>===========<p>One Concept<p>===========<p>For example, I can envision having something sort of like wrist splints that I could strap to the bottom of my forearms when I expect to be doing a lot of dedicated keyboarding.  On the hand-end of the splint would be traditional tactile keys (e.g. Cherry keys).  But the &#x27;splints&#x27; and their keys wouldn&#x27;t have any electronics or be functional in the way our current keyboards are.  Since the &#x27;splints&#x27; won&#x27;t actually be functional, there won&#x27;t be wires, which means users can move their arms freely (e.g. put them on a chair&#x27;s armrests, or drop them to their sides when at a standing desk).  Meanwhile, the user&#x27;s input is tracked by something like the Soli. The &#x27;splint&#x27; would be custom printed for each user, and the keys could be affixed in many different ways that would facilitate <i>maximum ergonomic positioning</i> for each individual user&#x27;s keys and individual users would pick keys that had the <i>tactile feedback the user desires</i>.<p>Alternatively, for a graphic artist, a similar &#x27;splint&#x27; like approach could be taken, but instead of dedicated keys, there may be small ridges, bumps, or indentations to mark important locations (e.g. a horizontal dash for the home keys and indications between keyboard keys) such that they could easily switch between typing and mousing.  A setup like this would lack the tactile feedback of physical keys, but would be better suited to mouse or tablet-like drawing.<p>For those of us that want more functionality, there may be a keystroke or hand-motion that would  move, or otherwise minimize, the input pad portion of the &#x27;splint&#x27; so that we could pick up a drink or write on a white-board, without having to remove the splints.<p>==============<p>Other Concepts<p>==============<p>But something like the Soli would facilitate many more alternatives.  For example, I could custom 3d-print a couple of pads for my thighs (something like a pilot&#x27;s kneeboard, but not as bulky - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot&#x27;s_kneeboard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot&#x27;s_kneeboard</a>).  When I&#x27;m sitting in a dark auditorium, I could be typing notes to my closed but still powered on device.<p>Since I expect something like the Soli can easily be packaged in a watch-type form, there are also lower hanging possibilities, such as interacting with public projectors, or having virtual buttons around the house (e.g. when I press the start button on my clothes washer, my Soli-watch automatically starts a timer for me, and alerts me when it&#x27;s time to move the clothes to the dryer).<p><i>And just to be very illustrative, a person could easily 3d print (or mill wood into) DataHand-like blocks, or Atreus blocks ;-), and put Cherry keys in these blocks, then use the Soli to interpret the keystrokes.</i>  An option like this is likely to be much more customizable than anything the original article will do.  It would be easier to actually construct (e.g. no wiring). And depending on the pricing of the Soli, may end up being cheaper to boot (specifically if the Soli is used in ways beyond just keyboarding input).<p><i>In other words, I think the Soli (or other projects like it) will open up input methods you haven&#x27;t even considered, and optimize ideas which haven&#x27;t been easy to implement with current technologies.</i>",1441554416

Well, would you consider putting your blood, sweat, tears into a project for a couple of years, for maybe $4,000? Because that is the &#x27;payoff&#x27; for this sort of thing. In other words, no writer is doing it for the money.<p>I did it because I want people to know things, and I remember when I didn&#x27;t have a SV salary (my father worked road maintenance, my mother cleaned toilets at hotels) and was utterly unable to access information I desperately wanted. Today I get emails from grad students and people from countries with economies that make it impossible for them to drop $150 US on a book. Why, oh why would I work this hard and then pretty much guarantee that no one but a SV engineer or tenured professor could access it? To me, that is a crazy proposition. Even if the book sales were $50K it wouldn&#x27;t pay back the time invested.<p>Print (this kind) is dying. We can use IPython Notebook (now Jupyter notebook), or LaTeX to make perfect copy. We can be open in all ways - share the source that made the charts, share the data, and of course, share the text. You can make corrections, or run different experiments. You can fix bugs in the code. You can change the language (text or computer).<p>Others have mentioned academic prestige. I guess that exists, still, for now. But plenty of academics are starting to use open source, and I both hope and think that this will gain momentum.

To make our business run smoothly and maximize the available time of the two of us who run the place, we can&#x27;t be held down by managing servers and services.<p>Investing in things like API Gateway and Lambda gives me the ability to keep my programming desires satisfied, while reducing the friction of tedious, time wasting operations, like automatically encoding a video of a class, extracting thumbnails, and setting permissions via API calls back to our home-brewed DAM system to make the video available for our students. Sure, I could do it myself each time. Six times per day of teaching. And turn down the process priority so it won&#x27;t interfere with the rest of my job.<p>The costs of using AWS at that scale, while certainly nothing like the scale some of you are dealing with, are a considerable savings over the hourly rate I can charge for the time spent in my subject domain, and would have otherwise lost. We manage VMs for classes already, and most of that is now automated by our Hubot. In the coming weeks, the services/sites/apps we do have running will be migrated over to the docker-based infrastructure I&#x27;m building (in my copious free time, ha!), and the services therein will be interconnected with API Gateway and Lambda functions.

For example, the last time I checked (maybe around June) the TeX support in their Markdown was not developed enough to handle aligned equations, which is a big sticking point for me and I think for most mathematicians.<p>The standard process for academic writers is to typeset an entire book themselves in LaTeX regardless of the publisher (they tend not to publish-as-they-write, though that could conceivably change). Leanpub is unlikely to convince book authors in math by forcing them to convert to Markdown, especially for book writing when cross-chapter labels for theorems and exercises are common. If Leanpub wants to attract academic writers in math they need a sturdy tool that converts a LaTeX book to the Markdown flavor that Leanpub needs. But that&#x27;s a crap-ton of work (especially considering third-party libraries like tikz) with an unclear contribution to Leanpub&#x27;s bottom line.<p>Of course, the alternative is to post only a pdf format, but that kind of defeats the point of Leanpub which is that they generate multiple formats.

Not because it is the most interesting math, or the most beautiful, but it gives you the most bang for the buck, followed by, maybe, the probability/statistic domains and then abstract algebra (basically the Latin of mathematics).<p>Discrete Mathematics is basically counting and algorithms, both of which you already know how to do, even if you didn&#x27;t know it.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to waste your time, follow these simple rules:<p>-Work out (don&#x27;t copy answers) ALL assigned problems, including extra credit problems.<p>-If you spend more than 30 mins stuck on something, stop and re-read. In maths, you cannot skim. It all necessarily builds on previous work. That is the nature of the beast and there is no getting around it. If after re-reading you are still stuck, go get help. Do not continue to stare at the problem. 80% of the time you&#x27;ll simply reinforce your confusion and frustration. Do not go online for help either. That is, more often than not, an endless rabbit hole where the vast majority of material will have nothing to do with your problem.<p>-Just refer to the assigned book, and if that isn&#x27;t enough, maybe one supplementary book on the subject, as recommended by a grad student specializing in that area of math and that also (super important) thinks like you. (You&#x27;ll actually need to talk and interact with them to determine this.)<p>-Unless you are already acing the material, NEVER miss class. Math professors are infinitely more likely to assist a student they see in class. I think that is because most people have an aversion to the subject that they think is the greatest thing in the world. So dissing the subject makes them pretty irate.<p>-If your answer doesn&#x27;t match the books, initially it&#x27;s easy to think the book has a mistake. The sooner you can squash this impulse the better. Go back and write out your work step by step, in the most exacting detail. If you are still not matching the book, go to office hours and have the professor look at your work. They will be able to see where you went wrong almost at a glance. Plus, you&#x27;ll look like a badass for doing math like math is supposed to be done. The alternative is to look like an ass emphatically arguing that the book has an error, and then when the professor spends 10 mins walking you through the problem till they can extract where you went wrong, you&#x27;ll be embarrassed and the professor will be irritated.<p>So. That sounds like a lot of work, but, unless you&#x27;re a math wiz, that&#x27;s actually the easy way. There are two alternatives. One, randomly go through the material only when you think it&#x27;s important and make a frustrating mess out of the whole exercise. Or, two, do the minimum amount of work required to get a C.

Like I said, whatever, you only live once and you may as well have fun when you&#x27;re young. It&#x27;s not like there aren&#x27;t other kinds of clubs on campus that aren&#x27;t exactly promoting a studious approach to life.<p>But it&#x27;s the <i>after</i> college that matters. And the kind of behavior I provided links to is the kind of behavior that matters to people and rubs them the wrong way.<p>> Who is this collective they you refer to? How could you possibly know all of their thoughts?<p>Why do a bunch of former frat guys create an interesting startup but continue to behave like a group of douchebags? I don&#x27;t know what their internal motivations are, but I know they&#x27;re presenting the public image of an asshole in a behavior pattern that&#x27;s associated with the frat-life. Why they chose to do that is not my problem. I frankly don&#x27;t care what thoughts they&#x27;re having that leads them to behave like a barely tamed group of hormone charged teenage gorillas.<p>But the end result is asinine stuff like this story.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8489273"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8489273</a><p>And this behavior really affects people. Lots of people. It&#x27;s not a &quot;victimless crime&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s the people who don&#x27;t stop realizing they&#x27;re in a frat long after they&#x27;re out, the aftermath of the frat-life that real people have to deal with. I know it&#x27;s a minority of frat members, but the size of the bad behavior overwhelms almost all other conversation you can have about frats, even the relative merits.<p>> This is categorically false. Everyone grows up, eventually.<p>I basically agree with you. But we&#x27;ve all met the 45 year old bro who <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> grown up yet. And a disturbing number of them have been floating up the corporate ladder by riding the coattails of their greek brothers. Some of them even get put into position where they&#x27;re running companies and are responsible for tens of millions of dollars. There&#x27;s a specific kind of life this kind of guy has been trying to replicate for a couple of decades, and it&#x27;s annoying and stupid to everyone around him.<p>Yeah it&#x27;s a stereotype, and yeah it&#x27;s a bad one. I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s an immediately recognizable one that most people have come into some kind of unfortunate contact with.<p>You asked what the problem was that people have with fraternities, I&#x27;ve answered it.",1414025987

8496149,comment,8495067,8495755,0,0,neolefty,,,"Overall, I think English is harder to learn to speak & hear, but Chinese is harder to read & write.<p>The Chinese students I know who are learning English have to work incredibly hard at it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any easier for them to learn to <i>speak</i> English than for me to learn to <i>speak</i> Chinese. Reading is definitely harder in Chinese.<p>* The set of sounds in Chinese is actually quite limited both in variety and in word structure. Yes, there are some sounds that don&#x27;t appear in English and of course tones, but there are more sounds in English that don&#x27;t appear in Chinese and far more pronunciation patterns. Words that don&#x27;t end in vowels or n/ng, for example. Chinese doesn&#x27;t have them.<p>* English grammar is far more complex than Chinese. Articles and verb tense stand out to me, but a proper English teacher would be better able to list the challenges.<p>On the other hand, both languages have mitigating factors that make it easier:<p>* International English / Business English is a pretty well-established subset of the language.<p>* Chinese has a common subset of about 1000-2000 characters that you can use to read newspapers and signs.<p>* Both languages are lingua francas, so in everyday use people are relatively forgiving of second language learners. (Mandarin Chinese is the lingua franca of the Chinese empire, which includes tens of minority languages.)",1414025549

Their original thinking was that creatures were a repeatable source of damage and thus should be costed as such.<p>Turns out they overestimated how much rarity mattered and underestimated the power level of creatures. As a result, we get pretty mediocre creatures and ridiculously powerful rare spells.<p>If every set were trying to outpower the last, then we wouldn&#x27;t still get functional reprints of Llanowar Elves or Grizzly Bears, both of which were in Alpha.<p>Really, the power creep from year 1 to year 10 or so was a desire to see creatures played in competitive magic and a desire to see more actual games of magic (if your opponent wins the coin flip and goes Mountain, Black Lotus, Channel, Fireball then no actual magic was played).<p>Since then they&#x27;ve actually been doing a sort of power oscillation. Different parts get more powerful over time, then go back to weaker again. They mostly focus on Standard and Limited where the power level of older cards matter less.<p>In summary (I&#x27;ve already written too much) there&#x27;s simple proof that the power level isn&#x27;t endlessly increasing: look at Legacy and Modern. Every set that comes out adds between 0-3 cards that see Modern play and 0-1 cards that see Legacy play. If power level were just flat going up, that number would be much much higher.",1414024845

  private offering exemption is in light of the statutory
  purpose. Since exempt transactions are those as to which &quot;there is
  no practical need for [the bill&#x27;s] application,&quot; the applicability

The big savings come from ditching the strong magnets and high voltage power supplies. Size <i>may</i> be a significant improvement, but these devices still need to dissipate more than a third of their power as heat, so it&#x27;s not as drastic as pictures may imply.<p>Solid-state devices have been gradually encroaching on vacuum tubes for a long time, but vacuum tube tech has been advancing, too. I&#x27;m not sure that cathode lifespan is much of a concern anymore at the power levels that solid-state devices can reach. The upper limit of how much power you can get out of a single tube is still growing, as is the efficiency. There&#x27;s a lot of low-hanging fruit for the design of microwave tubes now that we can actually do a 3d simulation without a supercomputer.<p>Solid-state devices haven&#x27;t surpassed any of the fundamental limitations on vacuum tube devices except for the entry costs of having a high-temperature high-voltage cathode, a vacuum chamber, and a strong magnetic field.",1414024357

So in theory it&#x27;s only when you start &quot;looking&quot; for investors, when you are &quot;publicly&quot; selling the shares, then you want a Reg D 506 exemption, and accredited investors.<p>However, in practice the Section 4(a)(2) exemption is often not strong enough protection (since we&#x27;re talking potentially significant civil and criminal charges) so companies go for the Reg D safe harbors even when not technically required. Particularly for unsophisticated / unaccredited investors, the courts have found that 4(a)(2) is not good enough, even when the sale was arguably private. See, for example, SEC v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119 (1953). [1]<p>Following the path of Reg D 506 is actually quite simple, and carries no downside. But even with Reg D 506 you generally try to avoid unsophisticated investors, since then you get into scenarios where you are supposed to provide &#x27;access to the kind of information that a registration statement would disclose&#x27; which is very difficult.

Here is just one: 
in 3.1.1, Local State Variables, SICP shows how to, in effect, define classes and create objects using only function definition with lambda and set! (that is, assignment) in the definition body.   The function you define this way is a like a class, the functions it returns
are like instances.  So you can do all this without any specifically object-oriented language features.  This occupies just a few pages near the beginning of a long book - the whole book is dense with worked-out ideas like this.",1414022640

A day off the internet, a day off anything with a screen, and a day off anything which is about paid work.  When you sit at your computer and think ""maybe just a few more rage comics[1]"" you're actually feeling a bit uninspired.  sitting and staring at your computer is the worst way to achieve inspiration.  instead, do the housework, bake, take up a hardware project, knit, read, do a correspondence course.  anything that is unimportant to your day job, and pleasant, and nothing to do with those computerboxes.<p>When my day off is over I go back to my myriad projects and sit down and actually do them.  It's much much much more productive than trying to work all the time.  I actually suspect this is one of the major advantages of the sabbath in Abrahamic religions.<p>Oh, and use bookmarks.  The blogosphere is much easier to forget about when you know you can find all the good stuff at a later date.<p>Like I say I'm no expert, but this helps me.  I find that when I try to break the trend and work all week my mind quickly devolves into that of a dullard drone.<p>Best of luck breaking that habit!<p>[1] don't judge me :(",1301767189

The language desugars the expression to ""0-(23 abs)"".  I think what threw me was the fact that Io uses a space rather than a dot for member selectors.

And the rendering is excellent - it's just that the creatures have a limited interaction with the real environment, which I guess is down to budget.<p>And Primeval could never approach, say, the brain-rotting stench of The Cape.

It works even better if the tasks are something that's repeated weekly (e.g. organisation of your living space), as you'll end up with a collection of points.<p>While easy and non time-consuming, it's powerful in a way that it creates a feedback process.

The new generation is there to get respectable wages.<p>The ending is gold:<p><i>""claims of shortage are ""often issued by parties of interest"" such as employer associations.

2400443,comment,2400184,2400184,32,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"My solution has been this: don't take crappy breaks, take real ones. Your brain can only focus for so long, it's normal that it needs a break, so naturally you drift over to the web.  However this is not a great break and doesn't really refresh you.  When I'm working on a project and find myself browsing HN for to long, I just get up and go outside, go for a walk, take a shower (I work from home), take a quick nap, even read a book or something similar.  In all of these cases I a.) actually feel refreshed when I'm done, b.) usually spend over all less time distracted, and most importantly c.) gain insight into the problem I'm trying to solve by ignoring it.<p>Many offices cultures require that you 'look busy' and web browsing is a crappy form of relaxation that unfortunately fits in with this well.  If you give your brain moments to actually relax you'll get more done with in far less time.  Web browsing when you really need a break is roughly the same thing is snacking on junk food when you really need a wholesome meal.<p>edit: One key thing I only implied is: leave the space your in. So for example playing a round of video games on the same machine your working on won't work, but (if you can avoid playing all afternoon) going another room to play xbox for 30mins probably will work.",1301765936

Each day, lay out 3 concrete items to get done.  Then do them without interruption.  You'll most likely be done with them by lunch.  Then you can do pterosaur things the rest of the day. Surf if you're stuck in an office, go to the park if you work from home.

Here's the author's own summary:<p>> To sum up, my point in this post was to posit an ""internal"" explanation, rooted in styles of pedagogy, for why the best and the brightest high school students in the US do not opt for technical majors/careers in college, while those in India do so overwhelmingly. My explanation for this was that, in the US, it is the authoritarian nature of science education, especially when compared with the ""creative"" way other disciplines (like history or literature) are taught, that is responsible for the math-phobia. On the other hand, in India, the cultural logic of the same authoritarian style of science education works out differently because students can discern a ""method"" in it, and they can discern no such method in the other disciplines, just a series of facts. Consequently, the best and the brightest high school students in India are less likely to suffer from math-phobia.",1301764486

Just because we know there is a risk of someone entering our house far easier if we leave the door open, they should not in normal circumstances be entering without obvious intent to do something, anything. The same could be said for someone going on to an open network. While it's easy enough to join said network to just use free WiFi, one could also be snooping on communication, or other possible actions on the person private network.<p>My point really comes down to reasonable expectation of privacy (with possible complete ignorance on such matters) from the network owner, and the possible intent of the person on the network.

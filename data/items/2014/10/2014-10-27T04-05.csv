We find attractive the things that convey status and economic security; we love our parents (and our children) because they provide for us.

Even in subcultures predicated on being so ~nonconformist~ and iconoclastic, people brush their teeth.<p>I&#x27;m sure your family and your relationships are very different and that all the love in your life is totally unconditional and moreover, totally uncorrelated with your ability to command resources.

8513918,comment,8513447,8513855,0,0,drawkbox,,,"> Like it&#x27;s easy to say &quot;legalize&quot; but where (geographically) can we find existing models of legalization along with which there is no market that incentivize drug-related criminal behavior?<p>The US before 1970 (CO/WA for MJ obviously 2014). Amsterdam, Vancouver, Uruguay, Portugal, The Wire (only kidding).<p>Would you rather stop someone from smoking a joint or actively help fund an army/cartel through policy?<p>It isn&#x27;t as easy as that no, but the problem we are trying to fight has caused incredible harm in blowback, and is only just beginning.  We don&#x27;t want to fund armies south of the US any further. We saw what happened in the 80&#x27;s in South America, now it has spread up to Mexico, and now along the border quite frequently. In 30+ years it has only increased the violence and caused immeasurable harm over that time. When do we start ratcheting it down?<p>The War on Drugs has not stopped drugs from their destination, in fact it makes it more of a demand product and the benefactors concentrated within criminal organizations. Drug abuse isn&#x27;t that high for illegal drugs, it is a manageable problem and safer regulated. It is more pharmaceutical drugs that are the problem now in terms of abuse.  We don&#x27;t create a War on Pharma because that is silly, we know people will abuse them and we help them. We don&#x27;t lock them up and give them felonies unless they are transporting outside of regulation.<p>Really all we have done with the War on Drugs is make criminals rich and they bought lots of guns. The War on Drugs hasn&#x27;t, nor will it, stop people from using drugs. Moral laws do not work, history consistently reminds us.  If people are going to use anyways and that is the case, the only solution is a non-violent/non-criminal response and tax it like tobacco.  People aren&#x27;t going to go out and start doing drugs tomorrow if they are legal, if they do them they already do them. Where people do use though it is safer with a regulated market as in Vancouver/Amsterdam/etc.<p>But the real question is... If people are going to do it anyway and stopping it with force won&#x27;t work, then where should most of the revenues of drugs go? Regulated, taxed and tracked or to criminals to build armies.  That is really the question. The War on Drugs is a failure in that it has only made the demand higher and riches from it more concentrated to criminals.<p>College kids drink and smoke weed sometimes. Do you want your son/daughter, or their friends, to happen to do this at college and have to deal with possible criminal elements if they do, or would you rather it be safer.  Why do we think it is safer to have kids deal with dealers that are possible criminals &quot;to keep them safe&quot;.",1414385630
8513917,comment,8513477,8513669,0,0,cooper12,,,"> The best way to predict the future is to invent it. Nobody has a crystal ball, so it&#x27;s really up to you.<p>In a sense you&#x27;re right, it usually takes a few people doing something different, and if it&#x27;s better, others will follow suit. However, by following current trends and looking at how past trends played out, I&#x27;m sure we can have a reasonable idea of what will decline and what will gain favor.<p>As the OP already noted, we can already notice a move towards web apps. Based on that one might conclude that we&#x27;ll all be using web browsers as our OS and Chrome OS is a perfect example of that. However, we should also notice that demand for desktop apps didn&#x27;t suddenly die out as web apps gained popularity. Desktop apps are still in demand, so the previous conclusion is too hasty. One conjecture I want to make based on current trend is that developers will start developing more for mobile platforms (phones and tablets), rather than the desktop because this is where consumer demand and use is moving to.<p>In both cases we can use current trends to strengthen or weaken hypotheses. It&#x27;s not like the future happens in a crystal ball either, yesterday was another day that contributed to the future.",1414385622

So rather than launching an app, reaching a home screen and then selecting an option from there, apps will provide direct links to specific actions that can be invoked from the OS. For (a simple minded) example: you don&#x27;t launch the Twitter app to tweet, you invoke the &#x27;tweet&#x27; action.<p>And possibly, the concept of API&#x27;s might hit desktop environments and we might be able to string together such actions much like we do with UNIX piping, allowing for more automation (e.g. &#x27;append this text to document x with time stamp&#x27;, where the doc is rich text document)",1414385593

The basic flow of development seems to be to write the first thing that comes to mind <i>as</i> it comes to mind, and then incrementally patch things up until the code <i>seems</i> to work on every test case you&#x27;ve thought up.<p>This approach is at best inefficient when working with &quot;safe&quot; languages. With C or C++, it&#x27;s nothing short of irresponsible. Part of the problem, I think, is that programmers are never taught to reason formally about their code: to catalogue their preconditions and postconditions and verify with <i>some semblance of rigour</i> that the code they write respects these. At best, they might be treated to a passing reference to object invariants if they happen to take a class or (God forbid) read a book on &quot;OOP.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to write good, safe code in C and C++, but not if you&#x27;re hung up on a &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;hobbyist&quot; programmer mindset, and not if you&#x27;re not willing to put in a fair amount of effort into <i>thinking</i> before you write.",1414384912

Also, braille has several contractions, including dot combinations that don&#x27;t map to single letters but to common two-letter sequences like &#x27;th&#x27; and &#x27;st&#x27;. Steno, being syllabic, requires fewer keystrokes per word than braille, but at least proficient braille users would already have the dexterity and some of the concepts.<p>Edit: On a more software-related topic, the interaction between Plover and a screen reader (assistive technology used by blind people) would be... interesting, particularly if the user is using text-to-speech output rather than a braille display. Plover simulates individual QWERTY keystrokes, and a screen reader often speaks in response to keystrokes. So to take the example of entering &quot;Python&quot;, the screen reader would notice the backspaces produced by the second steno keystroke and would try to speak the backspaced characters, interrupting itself all along the way, before speaking the newly constructed word (assuming the user has word echo enabled). The response to the asterisk key would also be suboptimal. I don&#x27;t know how best to solve that. On Windows, the best solution would probably be an add-on module for the open-source NVDA screen reader (<a href=""http://www.nvaccess.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nvaccess.org/</a>), which is in Python.<p>Edit 2: I belatedly remembered the correct answer to the above problem for Windows. On Windows, Plover should be using the Text Services Framework as an alternative to simulating keystrokes, where the TSF is available, which includes Microsoft Word and standard edit controls. I guess I should implement that.",1414384125

It is not necessarily incorrect to ascribe partial blame to someone just because they got the short end of the stick in some situation.<p>Being a victim does not automatically preclude one from being at fault. For example, if I jump off a cliff without a parachute, it is clearly reasonable to blame me despite the fact that I am definitively a victim of the situation.<p>In this case, it would be reasonable to ascribe some level of blame to both parties; we ascribe blame to the cartel for murdering people (and clearly most of the blame falls on them), and we also ascribe some measure of blame to the victim for failing to take proper precautions. This is not an affront to the victim&#x27;s character or a trivialization of their death; it is a recognition of the fact that, with some more preparation, the situation could have turned out much better for the victim. It is important to address these failures so that we might learn from them in the future.<p>Edit: Downvoters, please comment. I am curious what you think about this. In particular, I am curious why it is never appropriate to ascribe blame to a victim of any sort.",1414382676

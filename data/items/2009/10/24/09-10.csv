The cool thing is it's almost a quine - I can make the factory generate it's own code :). I think the plan is to offer a basic free version and a paid version that will allow deeper customisation. At the moment it only supports mysql but thanks to Yii making mssql/oracle/postgres work shouldn't be hard. I'll be working on this this week, I'll let HN know how it progresses",1256378283

900306,comment,899747,899995,0,0,prodigal_erik,,,"Their value they offer is the UI software but they're determined to get their money from marking up hardware. Presumably they have figured out people are more willing to pay the same premium when it's a smaller portion of the total price (even when it means they have to replace an entire computer to do it). In the same vein, they charged cloners too little to cover the development costs of MacOS, which is why losing desktop hardware market share to the cloners (who were more efficient hardware producers) almost killed them instead of freeing them from the 10% ghetto.",1256377142

900303,comment,899747,900255,0,0,jballanc,,,"Yes, and as for developers, they're developing for a market (i.e. Apple isn't supplying materials, just opportunity). It's sort of like how Detroit was developing for the petroleum market. The idea there, though, is that in developing for a market, you should have general domain abilities that can span markets. In other words, if you're an Apple developer, you depend on the Apple market to sell your product, but you should be able to take your development ability and develop for Windows or Linux should the Apple market collapse.<p>Obviously, it's not guaranteed that you'll be that smart. Detroit <i>should</i> have been smart enough to take their expertise in developing for the petroleum market and transfer it to success in the alternative energy market. But it's still not as bad as having a key <i>component</i> of your product be supplied by a monopoly (just ask your local jeweler).",1256376643

Although every company is different, the 3 most important are almost always:<p>- Profitability<p>- Cash flow<p>- Owners wealth<p>Of course, product & customer experience are important.

The whole point of flying is the speed. As far as ""good"" goes they can't compromise on safety so it's an industry that sort of has to pick ""all three"". That is a challenging business model to say the least.",1244725122
652639,comment,652424,652621,0,0,mdasen,,,"Short answer: no.<p>Long answer: there's no way to know.  The names that Amazon gives a specific location aren't something you can rely on.  So, your us-east-1a might be a different availability zone from my us-east-1a.  I'm guessing Amazon did this to avoid everyone ""going with the default"" and launching instances in us-east-1a and having way more instances wanted to be launched there than their other availability zones.  But it does mean that there is no way of identifying by name what the availability zone was that went down since the only names we have identify different places depending on our account.",1244725070

652633,comment,651965,651965,0,0,dflock,,,"It used to be that this was a valid interview tactic - asking people hard/obscure stuff and seeing if you could get them to admit they didn't know, then get them to explain where they'd go to find out. It used to be that there were many different places to go to find disparate bits of technical know-how, each specific to the task in hand. It used to be that knowing how to find out was a valuable skill, required of any developer - every developer looks stuff up, no-one can know everything.<p>This has changed a lot over the last few years - now the answer to all of that is basically just 'Google it.'. The only value left in this interview tactic is to probe the depth/breadth of the candidates knowledge and to see how they respond when they get to the end of it, in an interview/pressured situation. It's a good sign when they calmly admit they don't know and suggest sensible strategies for finding out. It is, however, a terrible sign if their domain knowledge stops before you get to 'What's a class?' - you really need to know the important stuff, end of story.<p>I'm always shocked by the number of candidates that I've intervied who get weeded out by questions like that.",1244724552

I love the new bottle!  It has never ""jammed"" up for me and its a huge improvement over the glass bottle.  I guess you should use those tiny ketchup packets if you're having a problem with getting ketchup out of the bottles.  Did you know that Heinz is in the process or might have already released a bottle that doesn't let that ""watery ketchup"" come out when you first use it.  It was their number one complaint from ketchup users.  That's customer focused innovation!<p>I know that your an Apple fan boy but believe it or not - not ""everything Apple"" is god-like in fact I find the iPod Nano lacking and it was the first product I ever bought from Apple.<p>Getting back to the Heinz ketchup bottle - I eagerly await your better re-design...",1244724483

Watching your ideas instantly take off or dud.<p>When you work for a company, you may have a very large potential audience, but you may not be allowed to try out some of your best ideas (and even if you are permitted to work on them, they may never launch to the public).

The tipping point for me was trying to decipher an unreasonably long regular expression written months prior to find out why someone's funky address (like the author's) was failing -- wasted time.<p>You can try, but you can't prevent people from doing dumb things, and in the attempt you end up potentially making mistakes like in the case of the article. Users will always do something unanticipated. With that in mind I only validate the things that really matter (e.g. credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc.).

Your marketing and sales strategy should be of the same quality as your product. Don't think of them separately. You're providing value with the product and convincing people to buy it with the sales and marketing strategy. Sure, the budget allocations shift back and forth, but both should always be above some minimum threshold of quality.<p>If you think of your entire company as providing a ""customer experience,"" then you only have one threshold, and everything is held to that standard.<p>The companies I am angry at are the ones sacrificing product quality and value for sales and marketing.

What is true for a small start-up is not necessarily true for a huge behemoth.<p>There are many other components to the mechanisms for making money (which is what businesses are - human machines to make money), and although product development and customer services are very important in the early stages of a company, the focus shifts, later, to other areas (like sales or value chain optimisation). Those can make a much larger difference to the company's profits, once it is at scale, and so they deservedly get more attention at those scales.<p>This article represents a very narrow-minded, naive view of business. Perhaps you should work in a wider variety of companies before making such grand statements. Maybe read a book or two about corporations.

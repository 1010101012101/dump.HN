It would be far easier today.<p>Check: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/24/usa.science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/24/usa.science</a><p>""You could have taken any number of classes at Beloit with Professor Dobson, until his recent retirement, without having any reason to know that in his mid-20s, working entirely as an amateur and equipped with little more than a notebook and a library card, he designed a nuclear bomb.<p>Today his experiences in 1964 - the year he was enlisted into a covert Pentagon operation known as the Nth Country Project - suddenly seem as terrifyingly relevant as ever. The question the project was designed to answer was a simple one: could a couple of non-experts, with brains but no access to classified research, crack the ""nuclear secret""? In the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis, panic had seeped into the arms debate. Only Britain, America, France and the Soviet Union had the bomb; the US military desperately hoped that if the instructions for building it could be kept secret, proliferation - to a fifth country, a sixth country, an ""Nth country"", hence the project's name - could be averted. Today, the fear is back: with al-Qaida resurgent, North Korea out of control, and nuclear rumours emanating from any number of ""rogue states"", we cling, at least, to the belief that not just anyone could figure out how to make an atom bomb. The trouble is that, 40 years ago, anyone did.""",1224122372

334029,comment,333997,334009,0,0,orib,,,"No. pretty much (gross oversimplification, but this is the essence of it) all you need for a nuclear bomb is to slam 2 or more subcritical chunks of sufficiently enriched uranium into each other fast enough to fuse them to a single supercritical chunk of the above, and you have a boom. The hard part is the uranium. Compared to producing the uranium, designing and manufacturing a viable bomb is trivial.<p>I remember reading about a US research project where someone with reasonable physics knowledge, but no specific knowledge on the workings of atomic bombs, managed to put together viable plans for a bomb from only publically available information.",1224121305

334026,comment,333997,333997,0,0,orib,,,"The hard part is getting enough enriched uranium. it's chemically the same as all other uranium ore, and the only difference that you can use to separate it is a 0.85% mass difference of the atoms. Once you have the uranium extracted, the bomb itself is trivial, as far as these things go. You need some knowledge about how it works, but the actual parts are simple enough. In fact, you could probably put together one with steampunk technology without too much trouble <i>if you had the uranium</i>",1224121215

334024,comment,333997,333997,0,0,jellicle,,,"Refining potentially fissionable material is difficult.  Remember that U-235 and U-238 are chemically identical, so you can't separate them by any chemical means, and U-235 makes up only 0.7% of natural uranium ore.<p>The Manhattan Project employed 130,000 people... many of those were NOT the guys designing the bomb, but the guys trying to set up refining operations and the like.  It cost the equivalent of $21 billion dollars in today's money, and took five years to get a bomb.<p>So, if you have a country that has $21 billion dollars and five years to spare, and can avoid getting bombed by the United States during that time, and is sitting on minable fissionable materials, they can develop a bomb...  Even if you give them a 50% discount because it has already been done, still, $10 billion dollars.",1224120817

334018,comment,333626,333983,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, emacs lets you hit tab anywhere on a line, at which point it reindents the line to the appropriate depth, depending on the syntax of the current and preceding lines. I'm pretty sure that most of the modes I use don't look at lines <i>after</i> the current line when performing indentation, but I'm not sure there's any reason why they couldn't.<p>If you want to reformat an entire block of code in this way, you can set a region (the emacs equivalent of ""selection"") and then press Ctrl-Meta-\, which stands for ""indent-region"". Then either the whole region will magically become properly indented, or emacs will yell at you because your XHTML syntax is broken (at least, that's what just happened when I tried this in XHTML mode. Every major mode can be slightly different.)<p>I know that emacs supports all the indentation tricks shown in this guy's example ... except that I don't know about the end-of-line comments.

3 of the last 500 American deaths in Iraq have been on a base.  None of them were classified as hostile.

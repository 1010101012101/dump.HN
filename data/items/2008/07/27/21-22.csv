258434,comment,258212,258357,0,0,davidw,,,"> People who are very talented can do a better job even at things other people are willing to do free<p>However, that doesn't necessarily mean that people doing things for free are not very talented.  Linus Torvalds, for example, is very talented, and initially did Linux for free, and of course still releases his work under a free license, even if he gets paid well to do it.  In those cases where you have very talented people doing things for free, getting paid for doing something similar for pay is going to be difficult.<p>I don't think the last word has been written on this, though... it's a fascinating phenomenon that is rapidly transforming industries like ours, and I have a feeling that it will take some time to reach the right equilibrium where producers get compensated adequately for their time, and people still get relatively open access to their work.",1217195377

Then they hit 35-40 bam, looks go down the crapper, which means you no longer get free drinks, noone hits on you and takes you out on dates.<p>Men on the other hand spend 20s/30s on their careers, they mature, start making decent money, and then they get their pick of desperate women...but they no longer want them, instead they want the fit tight 20 year old who is impressed by the bimmer.<p>Basically its a role reversal, at 20 its the guy going after girls, and at 30 its the girls going after the guys.",1217195188
258431,comment,257588,257588,0,0,helveticaman,,,"Hackers, please.  Let's get real here.  Why are Finns so smart?  It probably has very little to do with culture, teaching methods, or economics.  These can all be limitations (I suspect oppressive teaching hinders Japanese kids), but Finland's secret is not related to any of these.  It's related to biology.  Finland's secret is brain size.<p>Mother nature doesn't fuck around.  If your brain and its activity costs you anywhere from a fifth to a third of your metabolic energy, it's for a reason.  This essentially amounts to all the discretionary spending your body has.  That brain had better pull its weight, and it does.  Skull size correlates with brain weight; brain weight determines surface area; surface area determines processor power.<p>Again, if your brain could be a smaller part of your metabolism, it would be.  Mother nature squeezes every calorie for all it's worth.  So there is an advantage in having a larger brain.  And that advantage translates to being smarter.  ""Smarter"" isn't a particularly mysterious quality either; in biology, it's basically how good you are at deciding what to do with your muscles.  In the scheme of things, balance doesn't require much processing power; neither does homeostasis.  What is really resource intensive is good old thinking.  Writing requires forming markov chains.  Memorizing is hard too.  Understanding physics is also hard.  Thinking--just plain old thinking--is very resource intensive.<p>So, why are Finnish kids so smart?  Well, the PISA test doesn't convince me they're that smart.  They strike me as being about as smart as white American kids.  Thing is, the intelligence of Finns is not averaged out with the intelligence of people of other ethnic groups, who, regrettably, have smaller brains.<p>And before you call me racist, keep this in mind that the argument for different intelligence levels across races is borne out by a data set comprising millions of standardized test-score results, tens of thousands of autopsies, across many different countries, spanning centuries.  The correlations have R-values in the .8 and above range.  Don't call me racist; call Reality racist.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain#Brain_energy_consumption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain#Brain_energy_consumption</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Watson#Statement_claiming_links_between_race_and_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Watson#Statement_claim...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.americancivilrightsreview.com/africanfailure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americancivilrightsreview.com/africanfailure.html</a>",1217195025

258427,comment,258198,258364,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Technically, a ""Theory of Everything"" in physics is just a theory that relates the four known forces in the universe: gravity, electromagnatism, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear.  The latter three (I believe) have already been unified.  It's a ""theory of everything"" because it describes every force in the universe.<p>That of course does not imply that the theory of everything automatically gets you a complete description of the universe.  Even in the context of a single force, it can be difficult/impossible to come up with a closed form solution for how many different objects interact subject to that force.  For example, the behavior of gravity is really well understood but that doesn't mean that we can come up with straightforward, closed form solutions for the n-body problem of a bunch of stars interacting with each other's gravitational pulls in space.",1217194835

258423,comment,258198,258347,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"If you read a bit of Wolfram, he asks a provocative question: suppose the universe is, in fact, discrete and not continuous. If this is the case, and I think that's non-controversial now, then it may be that Sir Newton took us way down the wrong road with his discovery of the integral. We've been doing continuous math-type things with a universe that simply does not work that way. The integral was simply a cheat -- a numbers game that looked as true to reality as we could possibly verify at the time.<p>So we're working with known unknowns. That is, the integral works so well in most everything we do we're comfortable where it falls apart -- right around ToE, probably. But if we went belly-up as far back as Newton, where to start to fix it? I know I'm sounding like a shill for NKS now, but I _did_ find it had some really interesting ideas. In a computational universe, we could have really simple physics that lead to incredibly complex and non-intuitive results.",1217194528

All they are quoting (from my quick math) is the speed of a 10G network.<p>I can write a small program to stream 512byte messages from one machine to another on a 10G network and get 2.5 million messages across too. They're also assuming the network connection is setup and that the messages are fully formatted and ready to send. They also dont have any messaging acknowledgment or anything.<p>Please check my math:\n(I was lax with 1000 or 1024, but results are similar)<p>k = 1024<p>meg = 1024 x 1024 = 1048576<p>Gigbit network = 1048576 x 1000= 1048576000<p>10Gigibit network = 1048576000 x 10  = 10485760000<p>Convert from bits to bytes:<p>10485760000 / 8 = 1310720000 bytes per second<p>i.e., 1310720000 is the number of bytes that a 10G network can push per second.

Your lifestyle is different to the lifestyle of the Chinese over the past few millennia.<p>People in northern Europe eat very large quantities of cholesterol-rich foods: salted/cured pig fat, and a thick meat-based jell-o made by boiling pig legs for hours, are two popular dishes in Russia. This diet is not only tolerable, but is recommended during the colder months, as (1) fat is the best energy store we have, and (2) cholesterol reduces the freezing point of lipid cell membranes, helping maintain their fluidity. On the other hand, such a diet would be outright suicidal for an average middle-American.<p>The same cultures also eat large quantities of heavily-salted preserved vegetables during the winter; the salt is not particularly good for you, but the negatives are outweighed by the benefits of vitamins in the vegetables, which would otherwise be unavailable in the winter months. Again, not recommended for the average American who has access to fresh fruit and vegetables all year.<p>In Australia, people are hospitalised every year from over-eating after a rich Christmas turkey meal in 40C heat. The tradition evolved in the English winter, where energy demands are higher and digestive systems operate at a greater efficiency.<p>I do agree with you on the fads. Human metabolism is still sufficiently misunderstood that any claim that advocates particular extreme dietary behaviour will ultimately be proven wrong. The sequence of events usually goes something like this: x provides essential nutrients -> x is added to every product on the market -> scientists claim x causes cancer! -> scientists discover a way to emulate x with y, a healthy alternative! -> y is added to every product on the market -> scientists claim y causes cancer! -> ...<p>Those claim are generally true, technically. Everything you eat kills you; the trick is balance and moderation.",1217192543

I know all of it's quirks, and I know all of it's work arounds, and the density of support it has can't be beat.<p>I wouldn't complain if a better server-side language came around (not a big fan of Ruby's syntax, but Google's Go looks enticing), but until then, I've built incredibly complex apps in PHP, and rarely do I run into a limitation of the language.  My biggest issue in the past was the lack of namespaces, and 5.3 has those.<p>I think the best thing you could do to get a new language as popular as PHP isn't to evangelize, or even to make the language dead simple, but make it dead simple for administrators to add support to a typical shared hosting environment.",1285617592

A perfectly fair comparison would require Somalia to be under anarchy for the same number of years as the U.S. has been a democracy, but presumably you could pick younger democracies for an easier comparison.<p>I think you will find that:<p>1) Anarchies, almost by definition, spill into neighboring countries in the form of violence and/or refugess. This is the reason the U.N. intervenes in the first place.<p>2) A system of governance imposed by outsiders may be worse than anarchy, but self-governance, given a decade or more, will result in conditions better than anarchy. Indeed, I believe that left alone, an anarchy over time will develop into some form of stable government. Usually it's a dictatorship but there is a small chance it may be some form of self governance.<p>These are both as yet unproven claims based on my intuition of course.

Third, it misses a quite useful feature, the posix interface, i. e. the ability to mount the filesystem. Slight limitation isn't it?<p>Then I can mention a couple of other small problems. ZFS isn't at all cluster-aware. In fact, it radically sucks  as a cluster filesystem. I know quite an important storage platform who sent back 2PB of Sun storage because you know, aggregating 2PB by stacking iSCSI volumes and using RAID-Z simply cannot work and doesn't scale, though that's precisely what Sun tried to sell them.

I wanted to give you some more context on all three\n  points, not as a way of excusing the problems you’ve had but as a way of\n  adding some additional context.\n\n  Over the past year or so, we’ve been pushing to simplify and standardize\n  our development platform as much as possible, to address some of the root\n  causes of the issues you point out here. For instance, we’ve been trying\n  to move from FBML to IFrames over the past year because we think that\n  IFrames are both a lot simpler to develop for and a lot simpler to\n  maintain because they’re based on standard web technologies. We’ve also\n  been moving towards simpler ways of integrating Facebook context\n  (e.g., iframe-based social plugins) because they’re easier to use, debug,\n  and maintain.\n\n  Our end goal is to have a technology stack that is simple and\n  standards-based, because we believe that’s actually the best way to\n  address many of the issues you raise here.\n\n  In terms of bugs, you’re right — we haven’t been doing a good enough job\n  here. We’re working on this. We’re triaging bugs on a daily basis and\n  working through the bug backlog. We’re continually adding more automated\n  unit + functional tests to help prevent regressions and issues in the\n  first place. And we’re working on our communication processes — the way\n  the system works today, we actually copy verified bugs from Bugzilla into\n  an internal bug tracking system, and we then use that internal bug\n  tracking system to drive bugs to resolution. We don’t do a good enough\n  job of communicating back to the Bugzilla bug the internal status and when\n  we actually push a fix, which we’re working on. \n\n  In terms of documentation, again, you’re right. We’re building up a team\n  and focusing on this as well.\n\n  That said, actions speak louder than words. If you don’t see meaningful\n  improvement by the end of October, please let me know. My email is\n  mvernal@facebook.com.\n\n  Thanks,\n\n  -mike</code></pre>",1285617072

I'm sorry, but I rely on my blog for my entire income and so I need to know the support at the level I need is in place, the quality for the service I need is there, I have the kind of traffic that needs performance optimization and CDN, and I need to know that this is a clearly long-term viable business so you guys will be around in years to come as my blog gets even bigger. I really hope this is just the initial price plan, because I honestly believe that as you grow, it will make sense to let people host much bigger comercialized blogs on here.""<p>The point is we're simply looking at the entire blogging space and carving it up into different market segments based on needs and then super-targeting one segment.<p>Tony Schnieder (Automattic/WordPress.com CEO) said today at TechCrunch disrupt that WordPress blogs power 8.5% of the internet's websites - so we think it's clear that one size does not fit all and there are opportunities for different services to cater for different needs.<p>Finally don't forget there are much more expensive options out there... we're not WordPress VIP either which is several $1000's/month for service and support (TechCrunch, GigaOm etc run on this).",1285616909

It's been very interesting reading this thread (thanks ewj for posting!)<p>A few straight from the horses mouth facts:<p>I sat down and worked out what our revenues are, and they work out as $750/month over the last 7 years. Out of that, we pay for hosting, advertising, accountancy, and tax, leaving about $400/month and then Chaz and I split the remainder. Chaz just about scrapes a meagre existence in Spain. I live in the UK though so I have to keep on doing a day job (I've got a family to support). So up till now Puppygames has always been part-time! It'd be nice to do it full time.<p>If you're wondering why we bother at all, well, it's because it's actually a monumental pain in the arse to release two versions of every game - a demo and a full version. It's loads easier just to do a full version which can be unlocked. That's all our ""DRM"" is, really - just a really simple way of doing unlockable demos which won't go wrong and is practically impossible to not understand.<p>Also, anyone who thinks that it was a ""lot of work"" developing the system should probably know... it wasn't. It's really trivial stuff, and most of the hard bits are built in to Java anyway like the public/private key encryption. We're already working our little fingers off making the game, can't afford to spend any more time on unlocking schemes!<p>It really is utterly trivial for anyone with half a brain to defeat, and even crack and release. It's Java - any fool with JAD and Eclipse can rip it out. But what we're getting at here is... what's the point? The demos are lengthy, the games are cheap, the rights we give you along with the games are exactly the rights you would expect to have and want. They're exactly the rights I expect and want from things I buy, anyway.<p>Lots of piratey types give all sorts of feeble excuses as to why they get dodgy copies of things but at the end of the day we basically addressed every single one of them except one which is that the games cost too much and you wanted them anyway! Which we're figuring out how to address right now. We tried in the past reducing the prices of the games but discovered they made even less money.<p>Any suggestions?",1285616102

This also involves being able to chop up resources, including the cpu by way of a controlled VM context, for safe assignment to unsecured third-party clusters over the internet (though the security of such clusters itself might be in doubt, the first and most important thing is for systems donating resources to not be made vulnerable through their donation).</i><p>If anyone truly ""gets"" cloud computing, it's these guys.

But professionals do make mistakes, including writing bad code, and they learn from them.<p>- The Golden Rule of API Design: ""That's where the Golden Rule of API Design fits in: It's not enough to write tests for an API you develop; you have to write unit tests for code that uses your API. When you do, you learn first-hand the hurdles that your users will have to overcome when they try to test their code independently.""<p>The point the author is trying to make is that you should <i>use</i> the API you are writing. That is not what is necessarily conveyed.<p>- Write Tests for People: ""It is also a good idea to test your tests.""<p>What this means is tweaking the test/etc. so it fails under each circumstance that it is supposed to test, as much as that is feasible to do. But it sounds like the author is saying to write tests for your tests... Noooooooo!

3026744,comment,3025719,3025828,1,0,Woost,,,"For development work, contracts stating ALL work belongs to the company is <i>very</i> common. Actually, it's almost universal. A few states have laws that says that clause is void (cali being one of them), but most states don't.<p>If you decline every job that has a contract that says all work belongs to the company, you'll have a very hard time finding a job. (outside of states where the law specifically covers this case) The ones that don't have it will be ones where the management doesn't know any better, or (maybe) where you're a cofounder.<p>For reference I'll point you to Joel's writeup on answers.onstartups.com:

3026738,comment,3022023,3024120,1,0,PaulHoule,,,"Right now there's no real answer for disposal of carbide (VHTR/PBR) or fluoride (MSR) fuels.  Geological disposal and reprocessing are credible for today oxide fuels,  but not for these.  A fuel damage incident happened at the Oak Ridge MSR about 30 years after it was shut down -- radiolysis caused the production of F gas,  which in turn caused the production of UF6,  which migrated out of the drain tanks into carbon traps.  There were no serious consequences,  but enough U233 was involved that there could have been a criticality accident.<p>There is a grassroots thorium movement behind the MSR these days -- they're a bunch of smart,  wonderful,  and idealistic people but they're running against a headwind.  The U.S. government is not interested in radical innovation in the nuclear space because it may open up new paths to proliferation.  I think the most credible MSR concept is Moir and Teller's idea of having clusters of reactors built in huge underground bunkers.  Small,  modular reactors are exciting,  but I find it hard to believe that online reprocessing would be practical for something small that isn't being watched over by a team of specialists.<p>Prehaps I'm a dinosaur but I till think FBRs on the plutonium cycle may have a market in the long term.  It would take a long time for this to replace the LWR because of the slow rate Pu gets generated,  but the amounts of Pu available in spent fuel would be sufficient to open up new markets for small modular reactors that are highly proliferation resistant.  (A sodium fire probably kills you if you try to open it up,  and then there's so much Pu240 you'll never make a bomb of it)",1316710725

3026667,comment,3026230,3026630,5,0,nirvana,,,"Maybe I should have been more clear.  What you're arbitraging is two rates of return-- the interest rate of the loan, and the return of the investment.   In more conventional arbitrage, you're buying a commodity at one price in one market and selling it at another price in another market at exactly the same time.  Here you're doing that, only the commodity is money.  (Gold is money.)  You could substitute a foreign currency, or foreign bonds for gold in my example, just as easily.<p>In that case, you'd be borrowing US dollars and buying, say, Greek Bonds.   I picked that example because greek bonds have a high rate of return.  They're also debt... you're getting debt in one market and selling it in another.<p>Greek Bonds obviously have risk. All arbitrage has risks, and those risks can be huge.  That the risk is huge doesn't make it any less arbitrage.<p>FWIW, I don't think gold is at a particularly high price.  I think the dollar and other currencies, which have been long over valued, are a little less overvalued than they were.  I don't price gold in dollars, I price dollars in gold.",1316709734

3026605,comment,3026230,3026230,24,0,nirvana,,,"This isn't credit card arbitrage.  Let me describe one idea for how Credit Card Arbitrage could work.<p>You take out a bunch of credit cards, as he describes. Preferably ones with zero interest for the first year, or 6 months.  You extract as much cash from them as you can.  You put a chunk of that cash in the bank to make minimum payments from, and then you put that cash into an asset that will return more over the next year than the cards will charge.<p>[EDIT TO ADD: Want to clear up some confusion. In order to arbitrage interest rates, you have to have whatever you buy return more than what you have to pay for the money. There's one factor that people often forget when thinking about interest rates, and that is inflation.  Dollars spent to pay off a loan are worth less than dollars you get at the beginning of the loan.  This means, the asset you put your money into, needs to return not only enough to cover the interests & fees on the credit cards over the time period, but the monetary inflation rate over the time period.  Thus, something that is an inflation hedge is beneficial. This is why I talk about gold below, and later I talk about CDs and even stocks.]<p>I'd suggest buying gold, or gold miners, or if you're super sophisticated, options on solid gold mining companies. (each of these has increasing leverage to the price of gold.)  But  it doesn't have to be gold, it just has to be something that is a ""no brainer"" way to earn a positive return above the rate of the credit card interest.<p>This may be difficult, and in fact, it should be difficult, because if it were easy the credit card companies would do it instead of loaning the money to you.<p>Potentially, you could take the money from the credit card company and put it into a CD at the very same bank.  This works only if you really have ""no interest for one year"".  Buy a 9 month CD (or better yet a 10 month CD), and then when it matures, pay off the credit card, and you get the interest from the CD for free.<p>The thing that makes such arbitrage opportunities so valuable is that, because the asset you're buying returns more than the cost of your money, you can scale it up pretty much infinitely.<p>But this is where things get problematic if you don't cover your downside.  When the Bank of Japan was lending money at nearly zero interest, many banks borrowed in japan, converted the money to other currencies, and then bought treasuries of other countries. This is called the carry trade.<p>In fact, I wish I could start up a bank right now.  I'd love to borrow money from the Federal Reserve, which is loaning it out at almost nothing, and buy the best bonds (along with some protective put options) I could find on the market.<p>A company wants to borrow for capital expansion, it will pay a reasonable interest rate-- say %6.  The Federal Reserve is loaning at something like %1.  %5 profit, at the only risk of the bond (so protect it with a CDO.)  It must be great to be a bank.<p>If you have a startup you need to fund, and you can get a CD  the interest rates right now are about 1.15%.  So, I think this doesn't work for arbitrage, because while you may have ""zero percent interest"" there are going to be some fees that will overwhelm that meager interest rate.<p>But, if you could get a CD that paid out %6, and could borrow at %1 (on the ""zero interest"" plans) then you'd only need $400,000 in credit card debt in order to raise $20,000 for your startup!<p>Realistically, credit card arbitrage doesn't really work too well.  If you get something with a higher rate of return, and you use borrowed money to buy it, then that's really investing on margin and not really something you could call ""arbitrage"".  I'm sure it works for some people doing startups.... but isn't really reproducible on a wide scale.<p>BY the way, if you want access to some of that federal reserve money at cheap rates, at least some brokers are passing it along to their margin customers.   Then you can start looking for a solid high yielding company, borrow %50, effectively doubling your yield... don't forget to buy some put options to cover your long position in case it crashes.",1316708714

3026527,comment,3026230,3026230,11,0,_delirium,,,"Back in the mid-2000s, when money-market accounts were paying around 5%, and there were a ton of promotional 0%-balance credit-card offers, people from fatwallet used to use the term ""app-o-rama"" for this trick of applying for a <i>ton</i> of 0%-balance credit cards all on one day, so that they'd all be approved before the credit score was updated. Then, there were ways to essentially extract the balance as a cash advance w/o it being coded as a cash advance. A few cards (like Citibank's) would let you do a ""balance transfer"" via a check made out to you, and then you could transfer that balance to others and repeat. The end result was that you could take out a quick $50k or so in credit, put it in a 5% money-market account, and pay it all back 12 months later when the 0%-rate intro promotion would be expiring, netting $2500 interest.<p>You could also start a business with the cash, but that's a bit higher-risk...",1316707574

3026522,comment,3026230,3026422,2,0,ssharp,,,"I'm not sure when this took place, but prior to the credit market crash, you were able to get risk-free savings accounts at around 5% interest. As long as your credit-card rates were below 5%, I think you could call it arbitrage, though it's value is lost in this case since the startup was burning the cash, not just letting the arbitrage run its course and used the proceeds.<p>This wasn't a particularly uncommon scheme in the mid-2000's with easy credit and high savings rates. A rough calculation shows that with a zero-interest card (you could generally negotiate 0% cash-advance checks as well) and a 5% savings account, you could make in the ballpark of $450 over the course of a year per 10k borrowed. If you had good credit and could quickly get access to 100k, you'd be making a few thousand for a not much more than a days work + some short-term damage to your credit score, though at that time, credit scores didn't really mean all that much.",1316707485

To the extent this happens it is because of deep-seated problems in modern industrialism c.f. Ted Kaczynski. The cracks are just far too large in modern economic systems. Public social welfare programs play a large role in disconnecting people from their kin and neighbors; it becomes easy to feel irrelevant in supporting others.<p>The failures of modern industrial capitalism and social programs don&#x27;t change the the underlying reality of suicide, however.

Anyone stopped to consider what this might mean for a future where all content becomes hash-addressable on an anonymizing network... for instance, telehash over tor. So if every site is anonymous, and isn&#x27;t certain to be owned by citizen of nation X (based on geography), then it&#x27;s ok to break into. Anything found on any anonymous server is admissable.

8441051,comment,8437367,8437367,0,0,netdog,,,"I think the widespread insecurity of home routers will not improve anytime soon.<p>Background: I work at a company which makes a &quot;home router&quot;. It&#x27;s not one you will find at a big box store, but internally it&#x27;s not much different.<p>Most of these routers are built from a MIPS SoC manufactured by Broadcom, Atheros, or Marvell. Since their business is selling chips, not routers, these SoC companies need to make it easy for your LanWan Company startup to choose to use their chipset.<p>So these SoC companies will give you a reference hardware design. They will also give you a completely functional software package with Linux kernel, drivers for all the peripherals (Wi-Fi, ethernet, etc.), all the necessary user space utilities, a complete GCC cross-compiler toolchain binary which runs on Ubuntu, and a bad web app. You can literally unzip this package, run &#x27;make&#x27;, and end up with a functional filesystem image ready to flash onto the reference board.<p>So LanWan startup can start manufacturing routers with only one or two software devs who know some C and a part-time hardware engineer. Manufacturing is contracted out to China.<p>The vendor-supplied C code is not written by expert programmers. It&#x27;s obvious when you (try to) read the source. It&#x27;s also a huge and messy pile of code.<p>Where I work we use the vendor-supplied kernel but we wrote all the user space ourselves. All this stuff is written in C. The software devs here have more than a few years of experience writing C, but are very uneducated about how to write secure code. They don&#x27;t think about it. And management does not think about it. The only thing that matters to management is that the box passes the tests.<p>I&#x27;ve been around long enough to have figured out that things are like this in most places. Whether small companies or big companies doesn&#x27;t matter.",1412995691

They fuzzed some content to get the thing to leak an IP (according to their account).  Given the incompetence of the Silk Road admin, that&#x27;s honestly not a real stretch.  There were SQL injection bugs in the search on the site, and he left PHPMyAdmin running on the server.  It was amateur hour.  With that IP they contacted the ISP in Iceland who gave up the data since the server was violating it&#x27;s TOS, and the Iceland authorities got legally involved (with no legal issues in that search).<p>The fuzzing of input to get the IP is iffy, but it&#x27;s certainly not a cut and dry case where a warrant would be required.<p>The investigators did get warrants for some of the evidence they collected (esp. the evidence that tied , and I&#x27;d imagine if there was a a clear legal requirement for a warrant to investigate the web server, since they had overt probable cause it would have been trivial to get one.<p>Besides that the only way Ulricht can claim that the search was illegal is to admit that he owned the server, at which point that admission will certainly put him in prison, so an appeal isn&#x27;t going to do him any good.",1412995261

Electrons want to be matched with protons. Two atoms can form a strong bond if they have just enough electrons to bond them but not enough to repel each other. Oxygen can bond to oxygen via a double covalent bond (<a href=""http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/doublebonds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/doublebonds.html</a>) but it has too many electrons, so it is essentially on the brink of breaking up (much more so, than say H2O or CO2). Basically, if you have an unstable oxygen bond, many things introduced nearby can disturb it, starting a reaction.<p>The rest is easy: a single atom of Oxygen is extremely reactive. If you take an O=O molecule (= means double covalent bond) and add some fuel, you get fire. At high concentrations, drop in just a bit of fuel and you can get a violent reaction.",1412993267

PG repeated it couple of times and also one early employee of facebook ( employee #100 ? ) also said it in lecture 2 ?<p>I find it though hard to believe from mindset prospective that people don&#x27; t start a startup for money. \nEntire concept of capatalism in US and with almost every act from birth to death is tied with money.<p>How can someone then think of start-up and not think of money ?  One example often repeated is of Mr. Zuckerberg.  But Zuck was already rich even before facebook. He attended Phillips Academy in NH ( I read it , I dont know for sure ) which has fees of $47k / year.  Both Mr. Page and Brin were already wealthy well before google.\nHow many people here can send their kids to school paying $50k just in fees ?\nI saw many interviews of Zuck. In one notably, he specifically mentions that he does not need money when someone offered him $1MM check. He says look at my apartment in Palo Alto.<p>So my question is  ---<p>1.  Do you believe in making money by starting a start-up and think of your idea from that prospective ?<p>2.  Everyone has lot of ideas. Heck, some are leaving school/ college to make quick bucks. So do you write off ideas because there is no chance of making money by implementing that idea ?<p>3. A lot is talked about market fit in these start-up videos.

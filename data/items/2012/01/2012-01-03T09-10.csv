There, they append a compass point on each street depending what area of the city it's in - Lake Drive SE, Wealthy St SW, 28th St SW and so on. It took me a little while to fathom, but it turned out these main thoroughfares keep their name right across the city, so the compass points help you keep your bearings.<p>I love your grid systems (and I'm sad enough to sit and look at maps of them for hours) - I find it really difficult to get lost in the USA. Everything's just so logically laid out when you're used to European maze-like towns and cities. My small English town (11,000 people) is easier to get lost in than a city the size of South Bend or Grand Rapids.",1325584779

Even if a few innocents would be unjustly searched?</i><p>Good point, though it's slippery slopes everywhere you look: What it if works on bombs, but only in 1% of the cases? What about 0.01%? What if we had a similar test for other, more trivial misdemeanours?<p>Either way, I'm sure that even fairly strict prohibitionists will agree that carrying around a bomb is a more significant threat to others, so it shouldn't be surprising that a more significant invasion of people's rights is tolerated. How much bigger the threat and how tolerable an intrusion is in each instance, that's exactly the crux of the matter. I suppose that was your point, too.<p>Edit: Another point: Seeing this, it's not surprising that there is such a range of opinion about it. People have very different evaluations towards the threat posed by drugs, and different people also have very different attitudes about how tolerable those kinds of intrusions are. This opens up a 2D space, where I suppose people often fall  on a diagonal or end up in opposite corners.",1325582360

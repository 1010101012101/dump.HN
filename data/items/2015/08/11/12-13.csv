10040623,comment,10040302,10040535,0,0,joepie91_,,,"> I&#x27;m just not seeing this. Even without mobile-style push, apps like Conversations appear way down the list in Android. Note that because XMPP maintains a continuous TCP session (or WebSocket, or whatever), then you get &quot;push&quot; in a general sense; that is, there is no polling.<p>> Using an XMPP client on your mobile will, of course, have an impact on battery life, but I don&#x27;t think a good client will drain your battery. For me, Conversations uses less power than Solitaire according to Android.<p>I don&#x27;t know how accurate Android&#x27;s power estimates are, but I <i>consistently</i> have people telling me that they are switching back to proprietary messengers because every XMPP client they&#x27;ve tried drained their battery. Whatever causes it, there&#x27;s a real problem here.<p>> (2) I&#x27;ll agree that XML does make the development of XMPP libraries more complex, but we gain because it grants very simple permissionless extension capability, and that&#x27;s hugely valuable. If developers working with (rather than on) XMPP are having to hit XML directly, that is absolutely a problem.<p>The problem is that theoretical future benefits are worthless if you never get a base implementation going. XMPP is just <i>too hard</i> for many developers - it&#x27;s not a thing that you&#x27;re going to understand well unless you work on it full-time, and that&#x27;s not acceptable for a protocol.<p>Hitting XML directly is almost always a requirement. Libraries are woefully incomplete due to the large number of XEPs, and to implement anything yourself, you <i>must</i> understand the XML structure.<p>If the intention of XMPP or XMPP frameworks was to abstract away the XML, then they have failed.<p>> Finally, resources are the way they are for all sorts of reasons, but Message Carbons really does work for having conversation sync across multiple devices. I often walk away from my desktop and continue conversations on my mobile and/or tablet, and wander back to the desktop when I feel the need to continue with a keyboard.<p>I experience <i>constant</i> issues with OTR, most servers don&#x27;t seem to even support message carbons (nor do major clients like Pidgin have any useful indications of it), and frankly, I have never seen a <i>single</i> &#x27;regular&#x27; user get synchronization set up correctly.<p>This is really a pervasive problem in the XMPP ecosystem: everything is <i>too hard</i>. Little to no thought seems to have gone into the UX, and unless you are an &#x27;experienced XMPP user&#x27;, you really have no clue what is going on. The experienced users say &quot;meh, works for me&quot; and don&#x27;t set out to fix it.<p>This is true for the frameworks, the clients, and most of the servers. It&#x27;s just all-around user-hostile, and <i>that needs to change</i>.",1439297927

It&#x27;s not an accident that Clojure&#x27;s <i>fn</i> is only two characters. It&#x27;s design as a language encourages anonymous functions. Along with <i>recur</i> there are many fewer cases where the simpler ways to do something require a name.<p>The fundamental problem of trying to port <i>SICP</i> to other languages is that <i>SICP</i> is not a book about programming in Scheme. It&#x27;s a book about software engineering, and the points about software engineering are made in ways that can be readily illustrated in Scheme. <i>Cons</i> is used to illustrate engineering ideas, and while those ideas could be illustrated in Clojure, there&#x27;s an impedance mismatch between <i>cons</i> and the roughly analogous constructs in Clojure.

All six units were given access to these generators, but the switching stations that sent power from these backup generators to the reactors&#x27; cooling systems for Units 1 through 5 were still in the poorly protected turbine buildings. All three of the generators added in the late 1990s were operational after the tsunami. If the switching stations had been moved to inside the reactor buildings or to other flood-proof locations, power would have been provided by these generators to the reactors&#x27; cooling systems. Because the generators had to work at full power, when the wave hit, the crankshafts shattered and the system collapsed. These brittle crankshafts are also used in British reactors.[66]<p>The reactor&#x27;s emergency diesel generators and DC batteries, crucial components in powering cooling systems after a power loss, were located in the basements of the reactor turbine buildings, in accordance with GE&#x27;s specifications. Mid-level engineers expressed concerns that this left them vulnerable to flooding.[67]<p>Fukushima I was not designed for such a large tsunami,[68][69] nor had the reactors been modified when concerns were raised in Japan and by the IAEA.[70]<p>Fukushima II was also struck by the tsunami. However, it had incorporated design changes that improved its resistance to flooding, reducing flood damage. Generators and related electrical distribution equipment were located in the watertight reactor building, so that power from the electricity grid was being used by midnight.[71] Seawater pumps for cooling were protected from flooding, and although 3 of 4 initially failed, they were restored to operation.[72]",1439297823

10040582,comment,10040302,10040422,0,0,zamalek,,,"> XMPP is not battery-friendly on mobile devices (this primarily has/had to do with the absence of push notifications, it seems).<p>There is actually an <i>unbelievably</i> good XEP (XMPP extension protocol) on mobile battery life.[1] I learned things from it: radio power states and so forth. It&#x27;s incredibly detailed and educational and well worth the read even if you don&#x27;t use XMPP. That being said, so far as actual implementations go, I have to agree with you.<p>> XML is unnecessarily complex for this kind of usecase, and too hard and time-consuming to work with (and I agree). That is most likely what &#x27;slow&#x27; refers to - not slow in parsing it, but in developing for it.<p>I have an ever-evolving conformant XMPP server pet project. What I found is that the framework takes <i>bloody ages</i> and I have to agree with you there. However, XMPP is a protocol that is ripe for elegant architecture and you can make a great framework. If you spend the time making a good framework the protocol is an absolute pleasure to develop against: but you have to make that initial time expenditure.<p>> The correct technology is JSON-over-WebSockets, and it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to compare XMPP to a known-bad implementation and say &quot;see? XMPP isn&#x27;t that bad!&quot;<p>Sort of. XMPP is one of the few applications that actually really makes use of the &quot;eXtensible&quot; bit in XML (where it&#x27;s often misused as a dumb object graph). This means that you can do something as follows:<p><pre><code>    <message from=&#x27;...&#x27; to=&#x27;...&#x27;>\n      <body>You have work, go to http://... to action it.</body>\n      <form xmlns=&#x27;urn:my-proprietary-stuff&#x27;>AF3BD2</form>\n    </message>\n</code></pre>\nAny client that doesn&#x27;t understand the <form> element would ignore it and present the message (allowing the user to click-through to the web UI). A client that does understand it would be able to do the special proprietary logic. Servers are also required (AFAIR) to pass on that unknown XML unaltered.

XMPP is not battery-friendly on mobile devices (this primarily has/had to do with the absence of push notifications, it seems).<p>I do use XMPP in a mobile environment without any noticeable impact on battery runtime. It&#x27;s not the protocol which drains your battery, but <i>how</i> one uses it: If there is frequent activity in terms of XMPP stanzas being exchanged between your device and the device&#x27;s XMPP server, then the device will be unable to e.g. put the radio to sleep. Which, in turn, is of course causing battery drain.<p>The golden rules to prevent that:<p>1. Only send XMPP stanzas when necessary<p>2. Bundle and defer outgoing stanzas if possible<p>3. Tell your XMPP service when the device is inactive, so that the service is able to optimize the traffic (XEP-352: Client State Indiation [1])<p>4. Consider service-side stanza blocking (e.g. XEP-16: Privacy Lists) for stanzas of &quot;unknown&quot; origin to prevent malicious users from draining your battery.<p>1: <a href=""https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0352.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0352.html</a>",1439296861

Even without mobile-style push, apps like Conversations appear way down the list in Android. Note that because XMPP maintains a continuous TCP session (or WebSocket, or whatever), then you get &quot;push&quot; in a general sense; that is, there is no polling.<p>Using an XMPP client on your mobile will, of course, have an impact on battery life, but I don&#x27;t think a good client will drain your battery. For me, Conversations uses less power than Solitaire according to Android.<p>(2) I&#x27;ll agree that XML does make the development of XMPP libraries more complex, but we gain because it grants very simple permissionless extension capability, and that&#x27;s hugely valuable. If developers working with (rather than on) XMPP are having to hit XML directly, that is absolutely a problem.<p>Finally, resources are the way they are for all sorts of reasons, but Message Carbons really does work for having conversation sync across multiple devices. I often walk away from my desktop and continue conversations on my mobile and/or tablet, and wander back to the desktop when I feel the need to continue with a keyboard.<p>Hope that helps.",1439296855

If someone wanted to make an open IM protocol from scratch, they could make something much simpler, cleaner, and better organized.<p>On the other hand, all the other popular person-to-person IM protocols are proprietary, and XMPP is at least open, reasonably well documented, and with a relatively large community built up around it. Which counts for a lot.<p>If someone wants to build a new protocol, for example Google Wave, I would very strongly recommend against trying to shoehorn it into XMPP. On the other hand, if someone wants to make their chat client or server interoperate with existing chat networks, then XMPP is great.",1439296745

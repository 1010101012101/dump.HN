At best you get a universe that keeps you interested for a few weeks and at worst you just get thousands of copy-pasted fetch quests.<p>Anarchy Online and Earth and Beyond were mildly interesting, but that's about it.<p>I don't think PvP-as-a-necessity is inherently bad in a sandbox exploration game.  If anything, it's good: other players will <i>always</i> be more interesting to compete against, whether by direct combat, economic competition, or diplomacy, than AI NPCs.  IMO the only way to get a sustainable game that consistently produces interesting content is to rely on the players.<p>In my experience the primary aversion to PvP comes from games that weren't designed from the ground up to be about PvP, but had it forced into the system in a way that was simply not enjoyable or interesting.<p>EVE Online was ""so close, yet so far"" to this ideal, in that it got a lot of things very right but designed the economy too much around grind and spent the past few years focusing too heavily on strategic combat with capital ships instead of individual players.",1260662122

I work at a news aggregator and our eCPM is around $.50 from AdSense. I suspect this is typical. This puts a cap on how much it can cost for us to produce content: more than $.50 for 1000 page views means we're losing money. If you want to make more expensive content, it will be hard to make money using AdSense, because AdSense does not take into account the quality of your content.<p>It's hard to know what Apple is planning based on a patent application, but we do know one thing: nearly a decade's work has gone into iTunes. It is one of the biggest content distribution systems on the web. Compared to YouTube and Hulu, I would bet it's more profitable also. Whatever they are planning is probably related to extending the iTunes/App Store framework: they currently distribute songs, TV shows, movies, games, and apps.

Look at people trying out Silverlight or VS 2010 or .NET 4 for example.<p>When playing with non-Microsoft tech, people are much quieter. There are too many people who would love nothing more than to say ""Look there - a Microsoft employee using an iPhone/Google/Linux/whatever"" and cause a few headaches. The truth is that a lot of Microsoft employees are just plain geeks who like to try out  things.",1260659388

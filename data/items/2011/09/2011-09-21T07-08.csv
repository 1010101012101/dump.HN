3021140,comment,3019163,3020428,4,0,0x12,,,"> Given sufficient time, it seems inevitable that we will have a 3D printer medium capable of containing the high pressure of even a rifle.<p>Materials science doesn't magically provide you with new materials and and structural side effects just because you give it enough time.<p>The physical properties of 3D printed stuff, be it full metal parts or plastics are typically a notch below that of the same substance when used in a reductive setup (ie, milling, turning, drilling etc).<p>The reason for that is that depositing the material layer by layer from a grain or a wire (or a fluid) means that you have to fuse all those layers. Essentially a solid, defect free chunk of a hardwood tree is about as good as it gets when you are composing from parts (molecules in that case).<p>And the hardest of hardwoods can just about compete with the softest of the metals used for structural elements (but are still a notch above most plastics).<p>Cast metal (also an additive process) still requires some re-work, and 3D printed parts that have to be made to a certain precision require (skilled) re-work as well.<p>It is possible that you are right but at the moment that is pure speculation and I don't think it seems inevitable at all.<p>The one exception I would like to make to all this is a single-shot, single-use firearm. That might be possible, something that would just need <i>one</i> round, and which you'd dispose of after firing. The accuracy would be horrible (no way to sight it in) and it would be a pretty bulky thing compared to its efficiency but I think that might be possible, even with todays printers. Extrapolating from that to future materials you might get more accuracy but I doubt you'd ever go over that single shot unless the gun is to be as much a risk to the user as it is to the target.<p>On another note, a fake gun is sometimes just as effective as a real one, and printing fake guns is definitely a possibility.",1316591000

3021129,comment,3019516,3019516,11,0,heyitsnick,,,"To clarify a couple of points raised through the comments thread.<p>- According to the DOJ, prior to black friday, FT had $60m in the bank and owed $390m to players. Shortly after black friday, in June this figure was $6m.<p>- There are two main reasons for this - one is the exorbitant payouts - over $440m was paid out to FT partners who held equity in the company - that were taken from players funds. Named are 4 people, Bitar, Lederer, Ferguson and Furst. The DOJ alleges almost $120m was paid out to these 4 alone, and Ferguson is 'owed' another $60m in dividend payments.<p>- However, unnamed are many others who also received payouts; the DOJ claims FT - even when they knew they were insolvent - ""continued making payments of approximately $10 million per month"" up until April.<p>- Furthermore, they were making sizeable loans to their roster of professionals with players funds. One mention of ""Player Owner 1"" almost certainly refers to Phil Ivey.<p>- Finally, they were basically fronting US players millions - the DOJ alleges $120m in total - because they were unable to process deposits.<p>- The reason this is nothing like a bank investing a customers money and why the DOJ is alleging this is ""fraud"" and a ""ponzi scheme"" (nb there is nothing in the amended complaint that suggests charges of a ponzi scheme; but it did come from Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District in a statement) is because the money was not invested; it was used for dividend payments. Meanwhile, FTP was publicly claiming their players funds were maintained separately to operating accounts, deceiving players.<p>- This really has nothing to do with affiliates ""taking money out of the system.""<p>If you're interested in reading more, I write for this online poker news site:

Perhaps your company should charge per user and/or per copy shipped in addition to the basic rate.<p>Charging an annual rate may not work if they use it internally.

You could start with the expectation that they will replace it in 3 or 4 years and make the contract for so many years.<p>If they want new features or configuration assistance, your company already has the experts and can bill them heavily for the work. Your company might end up using them as a continuing source of revenue in this way. They might also recruit your developers.<p>The software has different values: what it is worth to produce, what it is worth to a company to have it, and what that company thinks it is worth. If they are smart, #3 is close to #2 and that is the number you have to bid towards. It is worth more to the other company to have working software immediately than to wait a year developing the software itself. To repeat old advice, start with a high bid that is more than you expect to get and allow the other side to negotiate downwards.<p>You will be expected to supply good documentation and to fix any glaring bugs in the product, so finishing the sale may incur a $10k-$20k cost.<p>Whatever you get for it is a revenue that you did not have before. As long as it does not hurt your business for the other company to have the software, that should be a good thing.<p>If this one company wants the software, there might be other companies that want the software.<p>Get advice from someone more knowledgeable before following any of mine.",1316589333

It's really fast when working with tests: run a test and point and click to the source where it fails from the stacktraces. I used it for a big refactoration of a rails app that would have taken longer time otherwise.<p>I switched to vim though because of some reasons (I was previously an emacs user).<p>1. less resource intensive (I had to upgrade to an SSD to even run RubyMine on my late 2008 (then top of the line) macbook pro. Running any command in VIM is almost instant, I never have to wait and I hate having to wait for the machine to do something. I even run the terminal in non-anti-alias because I like a 9pt monaco and that it's significantly faster than using an anti-aliased font. mrxvt is even faster, it's crazy fast scrolling through a large logfile, but then I occasionally have to copy and paste and doing that in OSX X11 sucks.<p>2. I want to use the mouse as little as possible (you cant get this with an IDE)<p>3. RubyMine could not understand all ruby code so the autocomplete stuff is for me less useful than in vim, where it's super-fast.<p>4. Less abstraction when working with code. If I really needed an IDE, I'd rather code in smalltalk where the runtime is the IDE.<p>5. Like having an almost stock editor running so that it's easy to stay productive on any computer.<p>A great tip that I gathered from <a href=""http://http://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-bernhardt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-bernhardt</a> is to map your current test to a key:<p><pre><code>    :map ,t :!ruby -I test test/functional/foo_test.rb -n test_whatever<CR>
</code></pre>
It's even better when not in a rails project so the whole stack doesn't have to spin up. Boom! instant test result after a couple of seconds.<p>I've also mapped ,m to NerdTreeToggle, works fine and it remembers the state of the project file.",1316588905

Especially initial setup costs and maintenance costs are a big dent; other humongous cost drivers are high availability, etc.<p><i>The cluster, announced publicly this week, was created for an unnamed Top 5 Pharma customer, and ran for about seven hours at the end of July at a peak cost of $1,279 per hour, including the fees to Amazon and Cycle Computing</i><p>Given that the article states that the entire system only ran for about 7 hours, I assume that it was one of those ideal use cases for cloud computing. So the benefit of having a disposable system adds value that is also missing in the napkin calculation. Sure, if you ran the 30k-core cluster for eternity, you might as well build your own data center. But for this case, the comparative cost analysis seems a bit pointless.<p>One more small nitpick: the $1279 you extrapolated from in your calculation was the peak cost, not the average cost.",1316588874

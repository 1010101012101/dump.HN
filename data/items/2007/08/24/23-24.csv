46441,comment,45698,45698,0,0,MadCoder,,,"Directly from IM in response to an interruption from my boss about an error message:<p>""I suspect there is an issue with the actual input from the database. (Note: we're working with a test database that's sketchy in spots)\n \nWhat do you want me to work on? Do you want me to spend the time tracking down that error or do you want me to work on ""X"" (that should have been done three weeks previous)?\n \nBecause I was thinking about ""X"" and my entire train of thought is derailed and now I'm trying to work on ""X"" and wondering what is wrong with that particular chunk of data.""<p>I suppose for the non-programmer it sounds like I'm just being nasty over nothing, but that little panic attack over a minor error message cost me HOURS in trying to get back to the original program in my head so I could finish it. In fact, I actually had to go and FIX the error to get it the hell out so I could fully focus on what I needed to be doing.<p>Once I got there, around 1am, the code flowed like water and it's done save for minor debugging. I was in the zone enough that if my eyes hadn't been closing by themselves, I'dve finished that, too.<p>Management, I think, has a double edged sword to deal with. My immediate boss wants to let me do what I do because I am lucky enough to have the ability to put someone else's code in my head in the same way described in this blog entry. It means that I can go in and fix it and if there's a bug I know why it's doing it and I know just where to push on it and where it needs shoring up--in short, after a while, it's like I wrote it myself.<p>But he's also dealing with HIS boss, who is dealing with the bottom line, and his boss would probably have apoplexy if he saw me playing spider solitaire as I let the problem I'm addressing work itself into my brain, and would have NO idea what I was talking about if I said I needed to get the application ""into my head"".<p>Wonderful blog entry. \n",1187998992
46439,comment,45698,45698,0,0,rml,,,"Point #3 ('Use succinct languages') deserves special mention. I've noticed time and again that writing small helper functions (especially new predicates) at my Scheme REPL leads to being able to express the problem at hand with ever more clarity. Also, a REPL with the ability to dynamically reload code is an invaluable weapon...",1187998319
46438,comment,45698,46402,0,0,jward,,,"I'm pretty sure what you described is what he meant by brevity.  It's not about writing <i>less</i> code per say.  It's about adding layers of abstraction, which classes are, to shrink the problem space.<p>Comparing python to assembly, python has basically added in another level of abstraction.  It's easier to translate a concept into python because of this.  A good hacker can build up these abstractions himself no matter the language, but it's just easier and nicer to use a language that has the type of abstractions you'll be using already built in.<p>Once you fully trust your classes then they become like DSLs and you build your program out of them rather than the raw bits of whatever language you're using.",1187998266
46437,comment,46024,46347,0,0,sbraford,,,"As PG has stated in his essays, it's much easier for a smart hacker to learn customer support, accounting systems, marketing/blogging, than it is for a non-technical person to pick up hacking in a few days.<p>Non-technical founders tend to overvalue:<p>- their lovely snowflake of an idea<p>- their business plan (that it will magically cause investors to beat a path to their door)<p>Things imho that <i>can be</i> hard for a hacker:<p>- sales<p>- finding and/or dealing with investors  (getting into Y Combinator definitely seems to help here, but what if you don't make the cut?)<p>If I could find a non-tech guy who can successfully raise angel and/or venture capital money, I would totally partner with as a co-founder in a second.

46427,comment,44580,45431,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Ah, but then you have to have a JVM, so ""having Rhino"" is a challenge.  But I guess if you're not on a UNIX system where Perl, Python and Ruby are pervasive and always available (or a couple of clicks or commands away), then having Java around is just the same amount of effort.  It also lacks ""beginner"" tutorials that are focused on the kind of interaction that you need to understand to build applications.  JavaScript is a weird interactive model, because you are talking to the DOM to do anything interesting, which is a mess--it's really way more complex than beginners usually grasp (I have a hard time with it, and I've been developing in several languages since I was a kid).<p>That said, I think in the end JavaScript is going to be the world's most popular language for almost everything, including web applications.  I happen to agree with Yegge in that regard.  But it's still somewhat less friendly to learners than the other languages I mentioned.<p>Anyway, if Rhino (or some other standalone JavaScript engine) becomes popular I'd reckon that in a year there will be some good tutorials for interactive JavaScript, and it'll become a great choice for learning programming.  I happen to think JavaScript is a very pretty language.  A few confusing quirks (Function vs. function vs. = {}(); modules, for example), but overall it offers some great functionality in a pretty simple syntax and low keyword manner.",1187996601

If you're doing it on a mobile phone you can even add HMAC (via SHA-1 or SHA-2, MD5 is still ok for that but we all know it's possible to produce MD5 collisions now) on that token when you're talking on HTTP.

Is it blogs hosted on servers inside Philadelphia?  Is it blogs hosted on servers administered by someone physically located inside Philadelphia?  Is it blogs hosted on servers whose business bank account is in Philadelphia?  Is it blogs written by authors who live in Philadelphia?  Is it blogs whose Adsense are sent to an address in Philadelphia?  And so on.<p>Personally, I feel like they would have a hard time going after someone who works for a company incorporated outside of Philadelphia.  The corporation runs the blog and pays you to write it.  The business exists outside of Philadelphia's jurisdiction, and you just do some work on the side for it from Philadelphia.<p>Interestingly, the literal reading is ""every individual ... engaged in an ... activity for profit must file a Business Privilege Tax Return"".

1624355,comment,1623697,1623919,0,0,celoyd,,,"<i>stack oriented languages and functional languages are a lot closer to each other conceptually than you'd normally think they are</i><p>Yes. In fact, here’s something to think about.<p>Imagine a dialect of lisp where every function takes a known number of arguments. You could hard-code this per function, for example saying that + always takes exactly 2, or you could do it by keyword args, or you could make every function take a quoted list, or maybe some other ways.<p>In this lisp dialect, parentheses would be superfluous (except to specify quoted lists).<p>If you wrote it backwards, it would be a forth.<p>For example, let’s say * and + take exactly 2 args each.<p><pre><code>    (* 3 (+ 1 2)) ; lisp\n    * 3 + 1 2     ; trivial variation if arity is always known\n    2 1 + 3 *     ; valid in almost every forth dialect, RPN calculators, etc.\n</code></pre>\nLikewise, it would be ugly, but we could imagine a shell-like language that used dash-flags for all args such that you never had to make a pipe explicit:<p><pre><code>    cat --file=foo sort -n head\n</code></pre>\nInstead of:<p><pre><code>    cat foo | sort -n | head\n</code></pre>\nIf you wrote this backwards, it would basically be an ugly forth dialect with keyword args.<p>Basically, if you don’t use assignment, you can chain things up however you please. If your syntax chains in one direction, you’re arguably writing some kind of bastardized lisp; if it goes the other way, it’s arguably a forth dialect. This is why I capitalize Perl and Python but not forth and lisp ;).",1282461828

1624349,comment,1623482,1624163,0,0,bitanarch,,,"You can follow Facebook Connect's example. A few points there..<p>1. Logins must be done on HTTPS. On the SSL level, the client must authenticate the server's certificate - i.e. the client must check whether the server's certificate is properly signed by a trusted CA, and whether the server  peer name matches the name that's being connected to, e.g. api.example.com. This means nobody will be able to intercept the encrypted passwords via man-in-the-middle attacks (e.g. by hijacking a DNS and redirecting traffic to his fake api.example.com server).<p>With proper server certificate authenticate in place, only the person/company/server with api.example.com's private key will be able to decrypt the HTTPS traffic going into api.example.com. So as long as nobody working for example.com posts the private key on Slashdot or HN, nobody outside of example.com will be able to intercept the login passwords - assuming they don't have other security holes like SQL injection problems.<p>2. HMAC or HMAC-like scheme based on shared secrets and sequence numbers. If you intend to let clients use your API via HTTP instead of HTTPS after the login step, e.g. for performance reasons - frequent HTTPS handshake can slow your app down a lot when you take network latency into account - you'd need to have a way to authenticate your clients on the clear without using passwords or just simple cookies.<p>What Facebook's HMAC-like scheme does is that they'll send a shared secret to you on HTTPS, in addition to just the open session key, when you login. Any FB Connect requests would have a session key, a sequence number, and an md5 hash of the whole requests appended to the session secret. Because nobody else knows the the session secret, the only person who can generate the correct md5 hash for that request is you. So even if an attacker can intercept e.g. a Facebook status update from HTTP, he wouldn't be able to change it or post something else to your wall later. The sequence number is there to prevent replay attacks so the attacker wouldn't be able to post the same message again.",1282461478

But do you really think that modifying the return values of person-age for everything in the system is more easily extensible than a subset type which is external to the objects? Suppose that somewhere else in the system, you want to dispatch based on whether a Person is old enough to legally drink alcohol. With subset types, you don't have to be aware of the Child/Adult/Senior partition at all. With the :after approach, you're dependent on the ordering of the after methods and you have to know about the existence of the :child/:senior/:adult test.<p>Here's the code for buy-beer in Perl 6:<p><pre><code>  subset CanDrink of Person where *.age >= 21;\n  subset CannotDrink of Person where *.age < 21;\n\n  multi buy-beer (CanDrink $person) { give $person, Beer.new }\n  multi buy-beer (CannotDrink $kid) { call-cops-on $kid }\n</code></pre>\nNo other code in the system need be aware of it.

I agree with your desire for respect; I'm just not seeing the falseness.<p>I read him as advocating patience and setting aside one's immediate personal desires to satisfy the needs of the person you're talking with. That is not perfectly forthright, but I don't think holding off saying the most difficult thing for a few minutes of warm-up is in any way false.<p>I think the alternative, which is to ask your urgent thing and then come around to asking how they are, can also work for some people. In particular, I can make that work with people who don't like small talk and with whom I have a solid relationship.<p>With most people, though, I definitely follow an escalation-of-intensity pattern, which lets me establish some rapport before getting to the heavy stuff. Key to me is being relatively chill about my own agenda. If I am too agitated about it, then asking how they're doing would indeed be false.

4536403,comment,4535981,4536291,1,0,mistercow,,,"That's not strictly true. It is partially a matter of editorial style, and many standards have exceptions where apostrophes are used to form plurals.<p>For example almost everyone agrees that single letters are pluralized with an apostrophe. It is somewhat less common to prescribe an apostrophe in the case of a number either. When this is not allowed, an exception is sometimes made for pluralizing the number zero so that it is not mistaken for the letter O.<p>It is fairly common to pluralize period-less abbreviations with apostrophes. The New York Times, for example, follows that standard. It is more common still for abbreviations with periods to take an apostrophe.<p>So basically, no. You don't get to just say ""this is the rule for apostrophes in all cases"" because that's not how the written word works. We (or the publication we are writing for) can choose our own editorial style, and screw anyone who doesn't like it (although you should be consistent, of course).<p>But interestingly enough, this is one situation where there <i>can</i> be a universally correct answer: a trademark. If Yahoo! puts out guidelines for how they would like their trademark pluralized, and they say it should be ""Yahoo!s"", then that is what everyone should use. If they say it should be ""Yahoo!'s"", then that's what everyone should use, even if it violates their usual rules.",1347944185

4536392,comment,4531553,4532849,2,0,saurik,,,"This is due to the different libraries possibly being compiled against different versions of the C++ standard library or C runtime, and is thereby somewhat relevant to and ""caused by"" this specific feature (where different libraries can do this in the first place).<p>The same thing could happen if two people, for example, linked against different major versions of an XML parser: they would be unable to share state, as data returned from one library would have been generated with one XML library and then would be modified by another, even though the types matches for the purposes of the C compiler.<p>In practice, different major versions should simply be considered different libraries, and many argue it is an encapsulation mistake to allow your public interface to be bound up with details of the libraries you use; however, this kind of use case is much more likely to either work correctly or fail horribly on Linux, as opposed to ending up in some kind of weird uncanny valley of stability.<p>People then reference C++ with regards to this, because C++ happens to have a library that acts on tons of core data types, and yet by default (you can build setups where this doesn't happen, but it requires coordination over the DLLs you are mingling) compiles trivial parts of the algorithms inlined into your logic (so there isn't even a function boundary at all, much less code that could be shared easily).<p>The result is that if C++ touches your public interface,
you are almost certainly, at bare minimum, wanting to share something ""simple"" like a string or a vector, or alternatively wanted to use exceptions somewhere. You now, however, run into the XML library issue.<p>Some people believe this is simply bad API design (as C++ should be treated as a library to encapsulate), while others believe it is a language deficiency. I argue that to the extent it is the latter you probably do control the DLLs that are acting as a set, and external APIs should operate under the former regime (as yes: you also have to worry about name mangling there, although compilers have gotten very good at that: we now tend to see them as part of the system ABI).",1347943963
4536391,comment,4534359,4536103,11,0,codehotter,,,"I keep hearing about faster than light communication with quantum entanglement. It seems to be a <i>very</i> persistent misconception. The same ""communication"" as with quantum entanglement can be done in the classical universe. You can easily create two entangled envelopes. People's minds are blown just because we put the word ""quantum"" in there.<p>Take two indistinguishable envelopes. Put a green card in one and a red card in the other. Shuffle the envelopes so that you do not know which card is in which envelope. Have a friend take one of the envelopes many kilometers away. Your envelopes are now entangled.<p>If you now open your envelope, and it contains the red card, you instantly know your friend's envelope contains the green card. Did information travel faster than light? No, it did not, since in order to communicate by this method you still need to tell your friend what it means to have the green card.<p>You still need to send slower than light information that Red is 1 and Green is 0 which you can only do once you've measured your own envelope, after which you've destroyed the entanglement of your envelopes.<p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where you can tell something about the other part of the entangled pair by measuring one part. Just like with the entangled envelopes, you cannot communicate anything by this since you don't know in advance what you're going to measure.",1347943954

HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the core technologies used to develop front-end. As you must have noticed, HTML/CSS/Javascript files are served by a web server and are rendered by browser(client) to display the UI. These files can be served statically or it can be generated dynamically using Back-End technologies.<p>Once you have mastered the fundamentals of HTML,CSS, Javascript, which is all you basically need to develop front-end, you may want to learn javascript libraries like jquery/angular.js/backbone.js etc and css frameworks like twitter bootstrap. These technologies will make your web development task easier.<p>2) Back-End: This is where the core business logic resides. Typically a back-end application consists of a programming language, a framework and a database. Its role is to perform the business logic, save the information in database and send the changes in UI to client as HTML. If the back-end is a REST API it can serve JSON/XML instead of HTML and Javascript can update HTML after parsing JSON/XML.<p>Some of the popular back-end language/framework combinations used are PHP/CodeIgniter, Python/Django, Ruby/Rails, C#/Asp.net MVC, Javascript(node.js) etc. Databases used are either relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL(MongoDB, CoucheDB).<p>My suggestion : After leaning HTML/CSS/Javascript, learn jquery and twitter bootstrap.

4536383,comment,4535990,4536282,13,0,colonelxc,,,"I think that one of the reasons it is not implemented is because it is a problem that isn't purely technical in nature.  So you want to lock people's accounts to prevent brute forcing?  There are still a bunch of decisions (both business and technical) before you can move forward.<p><pre><code>  1. User support.  How willing are you to deal with increased need for customer support when they start locking themselves out of their accounts after a dozen failed attempts?
  2. How do you keep track of the number of failed attempts?  Another column in your database?  I don't run any big websites, but it seems to me that if an attacker can cause a write to your DB for every POST he can throw at you, your website performance will suffer.
  3. If it takes a dozen (or a hundred (or a thousand)) failed logins to lock an account, it would be trivial for an attacker to lock users out of their accounts, DOSing your site in a different way.
  4. Ok, so we block IP addresses instead of accounts?  Now we have to deal with issues of shared or easily changed IP addresses (or botnets that can afford to have hundreds of thousands of IPs blacklisted from a site and still keep brute forcing).
</code></pre>
A lot of these issues are surmountable, but not until you do some basic threat modeling to decide what you want to protect against.<p>Maybe you decide to focus on preventing from attackers coming from one IP from slamming your site, so you keep an in-memory table of number of recent failed logins and perform temporary bans.  It wont protect against botnets, but hopefully you are paying attention to what is happening on your site, and can make changes if that becomes an issue.<p>> yet most password security guidelines still warn against what they consider brute-forceable passwords.<p>Your password should be hard to brute force, regardless of whether or not the site protects itself from brute forced logins.  The other big danger is that someone hacks the site and gets a dump of password hashes.  Then, it doesn't matter what anti-brute force techniques the website is using if the attacker can perform an offline brute force attack against your hashes.",1347943642

The number one reason why anybody buys anything expensive is because they wish to make a statement for that moment. Now if you go by what this article is trying to convey is the value of diamonds in the investment per se. No body I know buys diamonds as an investment.<p>My father once gave me a gift which his father gave it to him. Which is basically a wrist watch that automatically winds a spring inside while a person is walking. That watch is practically useless by today's standards. But that is totally besides the point. He gave it to me because that has some 'emotional value' and the fact that it was expensive at that time, and his father went through a lot of work to buy him that has some sentimental value attached to it. That is the whole reason behind its existence, He gave it to me because it means something to him. Many of my friends have asked me if I want to sell it, but I've turned them down. It looks awesome and is a jewel.<p>My mom also wears a diamond, and she has told me once she passes away that is supposed to given to me and never to be sold to anybody else. No, De Beers didn't whisper in her ears not to sell it. Its just my dad gave it to her and that diamond reminds her of her days when she was young, and the moment when it was given. That thing reminds her of those days. She just doesn't want some other women to wear it.<p>You can argue these things in the investment per se. But you don't give the diamond to your girl and that moment is gone forever. You can earn that money back again, but you can't earn that moment back. She won't have that diamond with her which she can remember you gave it to her.<p>As nerds we can argue about rationality, but what is that worth to human sentiments?<p>Besides you can expand this argument to everything around.

If you want to try to make your site DOS-proof (and potentially faster), one way is to move the site to the network edge.  Move the data closer to the user.  Put a copy on a machine in the data center nearest the user.  Do this in data centers around the world.  (""CDN"")  Give all the machines the same IP.  (""Anycast"") Your users will be accessing a mirrored copy of your site at some regional data center, instead of actually sending requests that go out to the internet.  Does Google do this?  Akamai?  Netflix?<p>Next time you access a popular website ask yourself ""Am I actually accessing the internet?  Or am I just downloading a copy of something from a local data center?""<p>A lot of these services are just marketing.  In theory they sound great, but things may be different in practice.  And that's why we frequently see comments that things did not work as expected.<p>I did some CDN experiments downloading pages using Akamai where I accessed content on the ""true IP address"" (the master copy so to speak) versus the regional IP address they provide through stupid DNS tricks.  Guess which one was faster?<p>It all depends on caching: what is in the cache and what isn't.  Same applies to DNS.  A DNS caching server (resolver) is only faster than non-caching DNS server (authoritative) if it's primed with the records you're after.  If they are not in the cache, it will not be faster.  In fact, it will be slower because there are more steps to the process.<p>These strategies are often based on 80/20, power law thinking.  If you are not in the 20 percent of content being accessed 80 percent of the time, then you do not see the benefits.  If no one in your region has requested a given page, and you're the first, it will be slower to wait for it to be cached at your regional data center than if you just grabbed it from the internet.",1347941749

Would the pool ball be suddenly acted on by some invisible force? Would it explode? Would the universe just end?</i><p>No, none of these. Well, <i>something</i> would prevent this from happening, but whatever happened would have a perfectly reasonable explanation at the time.<p>You have to understand, firstly, that in GR, the universe doesn't start at the beginning of time and slowly evolve until it reaches the end of time. Instead, all of space and time that ever was or ever will be, exist now and forever. And this one big <i>constant</i> eternal space-time is one of many possible solutions to the equations that constrain the universe.<p>If a potential universe does not satisfy those equations, then it can't exist and therefore it won't exist.<p>A universe in which your pool ball goes back in time and deflects itself, is not a solution to those equations, and therefore, that will never happen in any GR compliant universe.<p>So, what might happen instead? Well, you might get bored with the experiment and give up before you get it working. Your girlfriend might come along and tell you that you are neglecting her. Burglars might steal your time machine. Or most likely, you might never invent the time machine to begin with.<p>It's quite conceivable that in some sense a time machine is theoretically buildable, but the reason our universe is one of the solutions to GR is that no one ever actually builds one in the history of the universe.<p>Why not, you ask? Because if they did, that universe is much less likely to be a solution to the equations, so we just so happen to find ourselves in one of the more likely universes.<p>Another way to think about this is that perhaps <i>all</i> possible universes actually exist. In that case, we have to find ourselves in one of the existing universes. We can't find ourselves in a non-existing universe, since non-existing universes don't exist.",1347941667

Why do you think that it would make sense for me to try to write up and publish a paper on arXv?<p>My view is that doing so would take a considerable amount of work.

That once was when I needed to get sign-off from my current employer to have something I did before they hired me get published.  Unfortunately my employer at the moment was eBay, they had just purchased Skype, and the paper that I was publishing among other things implied that Skype was unlikely to be worth what eBay had paid for it.  This was..not fun.<p>If some research mathematician particularly wanted to sit down, pick my brains, and try to formalize the real-world constraints I've observed in my clients, that would be fine by me.

That said, there is absolutely nothing from preventing you from creating a parallel DNS infrastructure which copies the part of DNS you like, and doesn't copy the part you don't like. Running a root server is not a whole lot different (except in scale) than running a regular DNS server. Distribute your own root cache to your 'clients' put a copy of the root servers for the domains you care about into your machines and recursively resolve the rest with the regular system.<p>At one time this would have been prohibitively expensive but with Amazon's EC-2 service you could run a separate namespace for about a million customers easily for $600/month maybe less.",1347941476

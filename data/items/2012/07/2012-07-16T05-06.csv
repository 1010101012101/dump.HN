If you're building C or C++, that code should already specify all of its deps. You just need to stick to certain design rules.<p>Really, if you say ""build foo"", it should just figure it out. The only interesting part is if you have extra flags needed for some libs and/or headers, and those can be specified without too much trouble. Using pkg-config as a starting point usually helps.<p>I'm speaking from experience here. I stopped using make for my own builds a couple of months ago. Life is great.",1342418326

Investments in time, emotional availability, mental state, etc. And financial, depending on the circle you run in.<p>When we're young, we have things like time and emotional state and such available in quantity, so we can form those relationships. As we get older, those things start to dwindle in supply. As such, our mental ROI for relationships formed later in life needs to be higher in order for us to make that investment.<p>I'm much more interested in quality relationships now than I was in my younger days.

Particularly, the first is just a change of state--I'm still in your app, but now I'm no longer signed in. On the other hand, ""exiting"" is more like a motion; I expect to actually leave your app and not just be logged out. In UI terms, I see ""exit"" as a synonym of ""quit"".<p>Now, perhaps this makes sense for your app. However, if it makes sense to interact with it without being logged in, I think that is the wrong terminology. So I would definitely <i>not</i> use it for something like HN because browsing stories works regardless of whether I'm logged in or not.<p>I'm sure you thought about this far more when you were making your decision, so this is just my impression. You can always try to test the alternative empirically once you have a bunch of active users :).",1342417952

You should be willing to pay more if the customer is worth more to you. People and businesses with Amex cards are more affluent than average, so you are willing to pay Amex more to acquire them than you'd pay Visa or MasterCard. That's why Amex can and does charge you more, not because they're simply passing through costs. If that was the case, more businesses would choose not to accept Amex; many of those where customer acquisition isn't an issue already don't (like utilities).<p>Amex has more affluent customers, on average, because they don't give cards to people with poor credit, and most of their cards have a significant annual fee.

They could have potentially made billions if they had known the extent of L&H's fraud during this period, by shorting stock or the options market, so there is absolutely no reason to think that this was intentional or knowingly done.  It was far more valuable to Goldman to uncover the fraud than to just get this deal signed, they left hundreds of millions on the table by not doing this research.<p>It's a heart breaking story, but the shareholders of Dragon did it to themselves, they went to the meeting (without Goldman advisors) and they signed the contracts which traded their valuable stock for stock that ended up being worthless (although nobody knew it at the time due to fraud).  Why didn't Dragon insist on a thorough auditing of L&H's books before agreeing to a deal?  They went ahead and traded what they had without even looking at what they were getting in return.  They made a blunder out of greed, it's common, and it's not anyone's fault but theirs.<p>If Goldman had certified that L&H was solid, then there might be a leg to stand on here, but they explicitly punted and said it wasn't the job of a banker to audit a companies books.  This seems logical to me, and if Dragon didn't like that answer they could have gone and found another investment banking firm to advise them.<p>What was the 'right' thing for Goldman to do here?

Throw in another bunch of such realizations and a life long effort to actually come up with such realizations and you will understand why Paul Rand's approach is acceptable. He set out to solve Apple's problem. Not his initial and naive conception of their problem. He first made sure he understood <i>their</i> problem.",1342414877

An FPGA can be more efficient than general processor if it can be tailored to the specific computational task, but it will still be slower than if you made an IC with the specially tailored hardware.",1342414830

Here's my signing note:<p>I do educational research and development, and the lack of open access to research on effective teaching and learning techniques has had far reaching and negative consequences. See for example the book Academically Adrift on how ineffective current college teaching practices are. I currently work at a predominantly engineering school, and faculty don't even have access to most educational and psychological research journals because of the high costs. Think also of the thousands of K-12 teachers - none of whom have any access to most educational research. Imagine if doctors had no access to research, and that's what the practice of education has become.",1332118697

3721688,comment,3719645,3720334,2,0,mjg59,,,"While UEFI is a specification, every implementation I'm aware of is based on EDK. Practically speaking, all UEFI implementations are at least as complicated as EDK, and so are as complicated as the Linux kernel. The SCT is impressive, but only really ensures that an implementation gives appropriate results when well formed input are given to it. That gives very little indication of what the real world issues are in a code base, since we can generally assume that the real world is rather less competent at providing well formed input than a test suite is.<p>I've hit two real and severe bugs in EDK, one of which merely tended to crash any OS on boot and one of which allowed me to brick any hardware using the EDK BDS implementation to the point where recovery involved physical reflashing of the firmware.<p>Reality is that any codebase is, practically speaking, untested until it's been exposed to the real world. EDK, Tiano, and basically every real-world UEFI implementation haven't as yet. Putting them in the hands of people is going to find new bugs, and some of those are going to compromise operating systems. That's not a criticism of any part of the UEFI development process.

It doesn't need to be a calculated pause; the fact that you're lost there can tell ""what you really are"" to the audience, if you're totally engaged to the act of presenting yourself.<p>I don't speech a lot but I act.  It is often emphasized in acting that words don't matter much.  It is often the case that you convey messages that's even opposite from what you actually say.  In tech speech you don't want too much subtext, but still, there are more bandwidth in nonverbal channels than the actual content of the speech.  If you only look at the words it might be less than well thought-out writings, but in speech there is other information.<p>(BTW, as you find more ideas while writing essays, actors find more insights while speaking lines---deeper meaning of lines, or deeper understanding of characters, that sometimes the author hasn't realized consciously.  I'd just say they are totally different things.  I prefer finding out deeper meanings of a given script by acting it out, to writing a new script.)",1332118141

For example, when teenagers talk to their peers, or to people they don't particularly respect, their speech will tend to be peppered with <i>ums</i> and <i>you knows</i> and <i>likes</i> [1], as in: ""I'd, um, you know, prefer to watch something, like, interesting."". But when talking to respected elders, or working as waitstaff in a restaurant, the same people suddenly prove capable of uttering perfectly fine sentences in formal English. The ""reversion"" to the broken-up speech pattern is not necessarily because the speakers are thinking too hard, or drinking too hard, and it's certainly not because they don't know how to speak: It's often a subconscious but deliberate technique for setting an informal mood.<p>Some languages actually <i>have</i> a syntactically-distinct informal mode; English has the word <i>um</i>.<p>Why do I tell this random anecdote? The usual reason: I love to ramble. But also because my point is: Stop worrying about the ""ums"". They're fine. Your listeners were probably already interpreting them as a sign that you've become really engaged in the conversation.<p>(Now, of course, the above comment will be added to the YC FAQ, and teams will be competing to see how quickly they can get PG to utter the first <i>um</i> of the entrance interview. ;)<p>---<p>[1] At least, this is what informal teen speech sounded like years ago.

He's not arguing that we should replace C with ""higher-level languages"" that don't give you precise control of the hardware; in fact, he bemoans the fact that the PL community at large seems interested only in such high-level languages. Nor is he complaining that C is hard to learn (I'm not sure where you got that impression). In fact, the paper mostly takes for granted that C needs to be replaced, and discusses the challenges in doing so, which may be why you assumed that BitC is (was, really) just another typical research-community high level programming language project.<p>The fact is, C <i>is</i> broken, and we all suffer every day because of it. From a security perspective, C is a nightmare. It is not just an unsafe language (in the PL sense of having undefined behavior), but a rampantly unsafe language. Null pointers (which C.A.R. Hoare famously called his ""billion-dollar mistake""), buffer overruns, unrestricted pointer arithmetic, arbitrary casting, manual memory management; all of these are the cause of innumerable bugs in real code, often critical security vulnerabilities. C is also not the nicest of languages to code in. It is terribly verbose. There is no good way of writing generic code in it. The preprocessor is a gigantic ugly hack. Writing portable C is a pain in the ass, and building it portably is doubly so.<p>The worst part is, we know reasonable ways to solve most of these problems. In many cases we have known them for decades. Unfortunately, how to best integrate these solutions into a language and still keep it useful for systems programming was (and is) an open problem.

3721584,comment,3720363,3721078,2,0,sirclueless,,,"This is actually a good reason to move away from pixel designs and towards vector graphics. An assumption made now is that there is one or maybe two resolutions at which a 128x128 icon is displayed, and this is true for iOS screens. But with a more heterogenous selection of screen resolutions and expected screen distances, the actual display size of a 128x128 icon is basically unknown.<p>There are two problems you are conflating. One is that low-resolution icons have visual artifacts, and therefore manual pixel hinting is valuable. In general though, this problem only crops up for very small icons, say smaller than 32x32. But as screen resolutions increase, this problem will get easier.<p>The other problem is that at small sizes, we want icons to be less detailed and therefore more recognizable. A quarter-inch icon two feet from the eyes should have very little detail. This is a problem that vector graphics are very suited for. One can specify a low-detail icon that should be used when the real size of the icon is below some threshold, no matter whether that screen space is 64x64 or 20x20. In a world where the screen resolution of an icon that size can vary by more than a factor of two, using pixels is the wrong approach.",1332116286

3721549,comment,3720851,3720851,2,0,ak217,,,"Here are some thoughts that came up during a private conversation about Elsevier a few weeks ago...<p>The question is, why is open access publishing so expensive in many journals? From what I understand, it's because of the need to pay the technical staff (technical editors, sysadmins, etc.) - costs that in traditional publishing are paid by your library (i.e. spread out as a tax across all faculty's grant overheads+taxpayer money). These costs can be driven down by consolidating the journal publishing platforms (i.e. providing a service for people to organize their own journals and a market for technical editors to provide their services to the content editors).<p>And critically, there needs to be a way to incentivize authors to drive down the total cost of publishing. A big part of the reason big old publishers continue to exist now is that there is an open loop in the incentives: the authors don't bear the costs that they incur to the universities, and there is no direct feedback from the audience that is shut out by this cost. If authors are given an idea of what it really costs to read their article, and the breakdown of who bears that cost, the journals will have to compete on that total cost.<p>But this will not be very effective until university libraries start breaking down the cost of subscriptions to individual users. So one way to approach this is by providing university libraries with a system to estimate the individual cost of each article view (i.e. crudely, if a subscription costs X and Y users view Z articles, then each user will have incurred some cost that is X/Y on average). Then start discussing what to do about who carries the cost burden from the users who are outliers on top. This is the first step toward closing the incentives loop.<p>I agree that there are too many journals, but unfortunately there will need to be even more before the ones with the right combinations of cost and editorial structure will win out. Going back to the common platform for publishing and editorial services that I mentioned: the real kicker will come when the platform is integrated with a social network (where nodes can be organizations as well as people). In other words, once you provide an easy and trusted way for editors to write down their web of trust, display that web to others, and act based on it, you will have put online the informal web of trust (reputation) that underlies publishing. This opens really powerful possibilities.<p>In the meantime, traditional publishers are holding on for dear life and using increasingly desperate tactics (like buying legislation, in Elsevier's case) to hold on to their money funnel. This is holding back science by artificially restricting access to publicly funded research. (And don't get me started on the textbook business... although good things are coming to that because Apple will disrupt it from the bottom.)",1332115491

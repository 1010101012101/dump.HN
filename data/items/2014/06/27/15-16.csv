MonoCross is a crossplat MVC framework that you use on top of Xamarin&#x27;s Monotouch/droid/etc. to increase your shared code.

Every CS2 class teaches linked lists, right?  (Except for the ones that hit them in CS1, of course.)  But: when was the last time you had to roll your own linked list?<p>Once, not <i>that</i> long ago, it was important to cover linked lists (and other data structures) because you&#x27;d have to be writing them in order to implement a program of any significant size.  Now, though, all the common ones are already implemented for you (and to be honest, we don&#x27;t even use LinkedList all that often---array-based lists are better in most real use cases).<p>So now their role in (my) CS2 is chiefly as setup.  I still need to cover linked lists because they establish concepts that will be important when we get to trees (links) and to more general graphs (cycles and the lack thereof), as well as in operating systems (continuation inodes, memory allocation) and other areas.<p>But implementing an honest-to-god plain-old linked list holding ints or strings or whatever?  Who does that anymore?",1403884715
7954600,story,,,2,1,peacemaker,"Ask HN: Defeating the marketplace problem?",,"Hi guys,<p>A lot of my best ideas tend to fall into the &quot;marketplace&quot; category and therefore hit the main problem of marketplaces.  That is, buyers have no interest in using the marketplace with no sellers, and sellers won&#x27;t benefit from listing on the marketplace without active buyers.<p>There must be a good way to defeat this problem?  The best I have come up with so far is really pushing one side (probably sellers) to join with various incentives and so on, then once there are a decent amount of sellers, go crazy driving traffic to bring in the buyers.  This seems like a &quot;naive&quot; approach though.<p>Another option is to seed one side yourself (like Reddit did, or most new forums) creating new seller profiles with things to sell and manage it all yourself.  Quite a challenge.<p>What are peoples thoughts on this?  Surely there must be plenty of people on HN who have run into this problem with their own projects.

Darwinian evolution (along with its many deceptions, e.g., the alleged &#x27;evolution&#x27; of the horse, recapitulation theory, the peppered moth, and outright frauds such as Piltdown man) falls into the category of pseudoscience. Creation science is operational science carried out by PhD scientists who have contributed much to our understanding. Without them we would still be laboring under the mistaken belief that radiometric dating (along with its &quot;millions&quot; of years of supposed earth history) was exact science. Nothing could be further from the truth. Google, for example, RATE research (radio activity and the age of the earth), or this:<p><a href=""http://creation.com/radioactive-decay-rate-depends-on-chemical-environment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://creation.com/radioactive-decay-rate-depends-on-chemic...</a><p>If, as you say, pseudoscience is &quot;banned&quot; then why is evolution still being taught in schools? Why are students not allowed to question it or even be made aware of the many difficulties associated with it? Why can students not be told of any physical evidence, arguments, or other data that contradicts this bankrupt theory? All of this smacks of cover-up so that students cannot not see the desperately threadbare state of Darwin&#x27;s knickers.

I have a hard time getting less technical bosses to accept automated unit testing at all, without having them just reduce it to a % coverage metric that I not only have to report, but also satisfy annual goals.  For them, TDD is a potential source of new buzzwords.<p>TDD is one of those things that only works when developers have a high degree of control over their own work.  Anecdotally, that has been hard for me to find.<p>I think the only way to get widespread and useful adoption is to actually construct a high-level language around it, such that the code and the test are tied together by syntax, in the same file, and coverage is enforced by the compiler.<p>Otherwise, you&#x27;re stuck trying to enforce TDD via voluntary human cooperation.

Even if we did assume faster than light travel, it seems like you&#x27;d have to have insane levels of population growth to make it all that far from home without going very very slowly.

Those who e.g. destroy something beautiful for short sighted political votes.<p>Not just the politicians which destroyed our space future. Another example is the present political leaders in Iraq which seems to have caused a war just because they wanted to steal more without interruptions. Would they have done that if they knew their children and grand children would be in the news when their private jets land somewhere? (&quot;Blood billionaires land in XXX, all better restaurants take a holiday. Sorry honest rich people&quot;.)<p>Edit: About the Fermi paradox -- the simplest answer ought to be that there are ET probes somewhere in the solar system and probably with lots of sensors floating around. The scary part is that they don&#x27;t talk to us; that implies they are studying us and will clean the local infestation out before it spreads from the solar system.<p>Edit 2: The full argument (I didn&#x27;t see it in the article?) is that there almost certainly will be lots of civilizations in the galaxy. We have no idea if we are among the first ten or among the second thousand. So statistics say we should probably be in the middle -- there are lots before we existed, we just can&#x27;t detect them.",1403883868

If you try to install a package for which some of the dependencies can no longer be met because of a poorly maintained repository or something, you make take a closer look at the application and determine that you would be able to do the work you needed to do without that dependency being met. All other major Linux distros have package managers that allow you to override the dependency check (in the case of SUSE, you can do this interactively with excellent granularity, on RHEL you can simply disable the check altogether but then you&#x27;re on your own). On Debian and Ubuntu, you have to switch to using dpkg to install the package directly instead of apt in which case you can get past the dependency check, but then as soon as you use apt again it will refuse to work until you&#x27;ve removed the offending package or satisfied the dependency.<p>I understand the need to warn the user about the consequences of what they&#x27;re doing, but at the end of the day they are using the software, not the other way around.

7954450,comment,7952838,7952838,3,0,atoponce,,,"The post is missing a critical point: per the Debian policy, services should only bind to localhost upon installation. Further, Debain advertises itself as the &quot;universal&quot; operating system. This implies that the defaults are sane for many people, and if the administrator of the system installs a service, the administrator probably wants the service running. So, the only thing left to do, is change the bind address, and restart the daemon. Further, per the Debian policy, when a daemon package is installed, it&#x27;s configured to start automatically on boot for run level 2. The policy is written in such a way, that Debian system administrators know _exactly_ the state of their system, after installing packages.<p>This post is written from the Red Hat way of doing things, in that you install the daemon, do configuration, then start the daemon. However, there is no consistency with Red Hat systems. Some package maintainers will have the daemon configured to start on boot, some not. So, after configuring and starting, you also need to use chkconfig(8) to check if the daemon you just installed is ready to start on boot. More often than not, it&#x27;s &quot;off&quot;, which means it won&#x27;t start. Painful thing to discover when the server restarts, and customers are calling in that their website isn&#x27;t loading, or they can&#x27;t access their NFS share.<p>IMO, I have come to find the Debian way of installing services more sane, than the Red Hat way. I want my system working, and I want to know the state my system is in when making major changes.

Your worst problem is that you&#x27;re trying to get jobs in Orlando and using recruiters to do it. Both of these are bad strategies. Working with recruiters is the bigger mistake.<p>It is almost certainly not true that recruiters maintain an &quot;oligarchy&quot; over tech jobs in Orlando. All things being equal, hiring managers would rather not rely on recruiters to fill positions, because recruiters are very expensive. It may be the case that it&#x27;s hard to get a job from online job ads in Orlando without working with recruiters, but job ads are not the best way to find jobs anyways.<p>Here are some thoughts (grain of salt; I&#x27;m not you, and you know more about your situation than I do):<p>1. You&#x27;re in the hottest market for tech talent that I&#x27;ve seen in my whole career. That could change tomorrow, and eventually, after some number of &quot;tomorrows&quot;, <i>will</i> change. When that happens, your criminal record could suddenly become a much bigger problem than it is now. So I&#x27;d move quickly to find a full-time role and to start establishing a career track record. The longer you maintain full-time employment with established firms, the less relevant your background becomes.<p>2. I urge you to cast a wider net than Orlando. You don&#x27;t necessarily have to move to get a job that isn&#x27;t based out of central Florida. But you&#x27;re also quite young; if you don&#x27;t have a very good reason to stay there, consider finding a job in a larger metro area --- Austin, Atlanta, DC --- and moving for awhile. I left Chicago for SF early in my career and eventually moved back, and while I don&#x27;t love SF, I&#x27;m glad for the experience of trying it out.<p>3. Stop working through recruiters. Recruiters are bad news for developers even without a criminal record. But when you understand how most recruiters work, transactionally, like real estate agents, you can see that any potential obstacle to placing you is going to make you disproportionately less lucrative in their business model.<p>4. I think you&#x27;ll find that most software companies aren&#x27;t particularly rigorous with background checks. If you&#x27;re not trying to land a role where a CFAA conviction is relevant, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re obligated to bring your background up.<p>5. The best way to find a company that hires directly is to simply assume that they will <i>all</i> hire directly, if you find the right person to talk to. Two things you can do right away: first, make a list of tech companies in your region and start finding people you can grab coffee with, and second, start showing up at meetups and asking people about their jobs, what they&#x27;re working on, and what they like about the jobs. One thing you&#x27;re going to find out quickly is that employees in tech shops are usually incentivized to help recruit people. By talking to them about working at their company, you&#x27;re often doing them a favor, by setting them up to collect 4-5 figure bonuses.<p>So: Act as if your conviction is not a problem. Start looking outside Orlando, which might be problematic even for developers without criminal records. Stop trying to work through recruiters. Assume every company hires directly. Make a list of companies you might want to work for in your area and start finding people who work there to talk to. Show up at meetups and make conversation with people about their jobs, and see where things go from there.<p>There are going to be jobs where a criminal conviction is a roadblock (unfortunately, many jobs in my field are like that;  consulting clients, for instance, all tend to background check consultants; another place you&#x27;ll have trouble is finance).

Everywhere else I&#x27;ve worked, both contract and full-time (quite a few places) have not cared. Perhaps you can target small to medium companies. Especially startups (if that&#x27;s your thing) don&#x27;t care too much about such frivolities. This comes form working mainly in the Bay Area, however.<p>Speaking of which, if a recruiter is unwilling to work with you, stop talking to them. Recruiters are dime a dozen. When one drops out, ten pop up. There is no need to deal with the bad ones (almost all of them). I&#x27;ve noticed this in the Bay Area, Austin, Portland, and Seattle. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s no different in Orlando. Basically, don&#x27;t tell them about your past. They don&#x27;t need to know anyway. Just ask about the hiring process and decline if it includes a background check. There&#x27;s no need to be honest with recruiters. Seriously, if I had to guess, I&#x27;d say there are at least ten recruiters for every engineer, designer, etc.<p>Now, if you need help getting in touch with more recruiters that&#x27;s very simple. Use dice, linkedin, stackoverflow careers, or whatever. Just post your resume up and make sure your availability date is in the near future. You may want to use a separate email (and maybe even phone number) just for this as it&#x27;s guaranteed to get recruiter&#x27;s attention and offers (oftentimes referred to as recruiter spam).",1403882510

Dobzhansky cited the fact that of the more than two million species living on Earth only one had evolved language, extragenetically transmitted culture, and awareness of self and death, as proof that it is “fatuous” to hold “the opinion that if life exists anywhere else it must eventually give rise to rational beings.”“<p>I find this interesting because some scientists are open to the fact that dolphins[1] and elephants[2] may be significantly more intelligent than we previously supposed, and possibly as intelligent as humans.  The difficulty lies in defining exactly what intelligence is - and how we measure it in other animals.<p>That in turn leads to more questions. Suppose that there is, in fact, at least 3 human-level sentient species on our own planet. Observe: only one of them have developed tools to the extent that space travel is a problem that we&#x27;re trying to solve.  Perhaps the reality is that there <i>are</i> as many intelligent species as astronomers posit - maybe multiple species per planet! - but almost all of them have no interest in exploring and settling on other planets.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-intelligence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-intelligence/</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition</a>",1403882508

Most programmers now bill themselves as full-stack app developers, and probably spend at least half their time working on the front-end/UI.<p>I hadn&#x27;t heard of functional testing before. From a stackoverflow answer:<p>> Functional Tests are written from the user&#x27;s perspective. They ensure that the system is functioning as users are expecting it to.<p>This makes much more sense to me than TDD. TDD is writing functions which test other functions. Are the users writing code, and passing arguments to function calls? If not, then time spent on TDD isn&#x27;t adding much value for the users.<p>So what does it mean to write functional tests? I&#x27;d argue that writing modular React components is a form of functional testing. Devcards[1] is similar, and looks to me exactly like what would be considered functional testing. These two workflows feel much more natural than testing UIs methods like automated selenium browser interactions to generate screenshots.<p>1. <a href=""http://rigsomelight.com/2014/06/03/devcards-taking-interactivity-to-the-next-level.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rigsomelight.com/2014/06/03/devcards-taking-interacti...</a>",1403882117

This was the easy choice, obviously. If I really wanted to cover my butt, I could turn on one of my best friends, Mark Jeffrey, and fire him for making the only mistake he’s ever made working for me. The other option was to keep John on and deal with the potential firestorm of criticism that we’re now facing.<p>I chose to put my job and reputation on the line and keep John employed.<p>At this moment, I’m honestly glad we didn’t know about what John did when we hired him and I’m happy we’ve kept him on board.

Open source indeed.<p>Oh and those binary blobs.. those are LICENSED. You are not allowed to make an android build and distribute it, if it contains those blobs. And without those blobs the ROMS are useless because you need drivers for basic things like your camera, phone radio, etc.<p>Google have taken the Open Source ideology and bastardized it to fit their commercial needs. And look, I have no problems with companies making money, but then you don&#x27;t get to also say how &quot;open source friendly&quot; you are, when clearly you&#x27;re just using open source as a marketing ploy.<p>>These companies sell personalized advertisements, they do not sell your data.<p>Feel free to explain this clause in Google&#x27;s privacy policy.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a><p>>We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites.",1403881532

Full disclosure that I am a proponent of Backbone, and Angular too. Right fit for the project.<p>Ext JS 3.x did what we needed it to do and did them well; grids. Lots of grids. Other than that it was kind of difficult to build a single page application without routing since Ext JS 3.x didn&#x27;t have anything built-in, so we had to make our own. We used Ext JS 3.x less like a framework and more like a utility. There were some pain points around the REST aspects as well. Remote data with Ext JS can be difficult.<p>We found that after moving to Ext JS 4.x everything was more polished. The ability to theme with SASS, mixins, etc. The MVC pattern was a big plus. Performance was faster, and the integrated builds Sencha introduced with Sencha Command were excellent for automation. We still ran into problems with internationalization, which Ext JS 4.x does support in its own controls, but you have to roll your own for content. There were also some pain points again with remote data. Still much better than previous versions. Ext JS 5.x is building on the MVVM pattern and adding a number of great features. Migrating and upgrading to new versions is actually much more streamlined and automated.<p>One topic I want to point out that throughout any of the projects I worked on with Ext JS the remote data was always the pain point. Every single, time. On a large scale project usually teams are split up, UI, middleware, etc. We found that you had to design the REST endpoints carefully with the middleware team so that they worked well with what the Ext JS proxy expected. Like pagination for a simple example. You can customize and extend Ext JS of course, it is just we found bending Ext JS to meet another teams interpretation of how a REST endpoint worked was really difficult. Granted that comes down to communication, but even then I still saw problems. There are plenty of others on the Sencha forums.<p>I like Ext JS, I think Sencha has a mature product. Excellent support and a great community. Like any framework, it has pros and cons. I can&#x27;t speak to Sencha Touch as I do native iOS, but I am sure it is similar as they share a lot of the same concepts.<p>Other frameworks like Angular, and Backbone I usually lean towards though as they are the groundwork, a foundation. They allow me or a team to build an application without getting in the way too much or dictating how.",1403881273

You can figure out tortoise-and-hare algorithm by reasoning (I&#x27;m pretty sure I did the first time I&#x27;ve seen the problem - although not in an interview setting).  The key is to recognize that there&#x27;s a very limited number of things you can do given all the constraints: moving pointers is pretty much the only tool you have.<p>If it indeed took 12 years for the algorithm to appear, it&#x27;s likely because finding loops in a linked list isn&#x27;t a very common problem, not because the algorithm itself is that hard.",1403881210

In 20 years I&#x27;ve never written a linked-list or sorting algorithm for work yet interviews are increasingly narrowly scoped to algorithm questions. I&#x27;ve found that these questions are usually asked by young people because they are fresh out of school and have been led to believe that knowledge of algorithms is the most important consideration. Give them a decade of creating products based on css, html, node.js, nosql, yessql, etc and they will come to realize that programming is more about understanding what a customer needs and finding the most efficient way of delivering a solution. Ability to work with other, lead a team, write clearly, explain to customers the tradeoffs and costs of different solutions are actually way more important than knowing how to find a cycle in a linked list.",1403881204

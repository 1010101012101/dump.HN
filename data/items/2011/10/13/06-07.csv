Is this correct?  If so, I'd say that the WSJ is pulling feathers out of their ar$e akin to ""current spending is lower than the high from the 1890's - who cares if this boom is more sustainable and less inflated than the tech bubble? For once CNet is doing a better job than the WSJ.",1318488979

3106410,comment,3103530,3104144,2,0,zallarak,,,"Here is a potential reason why some are upset. Its obvious that large corporations like Chevy, Clorox, Apple sell to Monstanto [and other corporations some could consider ""bad"" or whatever you want to label it]. But when startups do it [especially YC startups who I generally believe have smarter people involved relative to large corporations] it is felt because people generally hold them to higher standards [not just in situations like this, it applies for operational, financial and strategic measures as well]. I worked at a YC startup for a while, and saw some pretty generous things done by YC founders for society.<p>Another way to look at it (if it helps you understand the other perspective): You frequently see YC funded companies help each other out. Why do they do it? Is it just to accumulate more wealth/raise a valuation? Or is it because they've developed meaningful relationships and care for each other? I use this example to show how empathy and relationships can impact business decisions in a general sense, and that this same logic could be used to apply to a YC company NOT being proud of serving a large corporation known to use tactics that harm farmers in underdeveloped nations.<p>The fact that you use the term 'hold to a standard' at least implies that some could perceive the action as 'slimy'.<p>Finally, as someone wise once said, ""be the change you want to see in the world"" -- of course we hold YC companies to a higher standard :), many are made up of brilliant and compassionate individuals whose products make the world a better place. /cheese",1318488857

Whether or not you agree with the sentiments expressed in the parent comment, the fact is that it doesn't meet those standards. Even if the logic wasn't childish (""fuck X by association"", really?), the comment does little to substantiate its opinions, or to educate those who aren't aware of the issue. In other words, it's a populist comment expressly made to pander to those who are already in agreement.<p>Upvoting said comment means either (a) you haven't even considered the importance of having a quality discussion, (b) you've considered it but in this case you don't care, or (c) you actually think it's a high quality comment. The fact that the comment is sitting pretty at the top of the page means that people have, en masse, fallen into one of these categories.

So, why use this when all the folks are out there on other networks? Again, coming back to the point. Besperk looks neat. Say if @KindSidharth sells Besperk to a company and think they've done a good job, the product is gonna go nowhere as many companies look for features that simplifies stuff and empowers them at the same time. Say this is a product X that they would be using. When someone showcases product Y to the company, there is a high probability that the company 'will' go for Y. Cuz its better. I would suggest Open Sourcing the product as ""Evolution of Design happens only when its copied"" as quoted by @KingSidharth himself to me once. There is a high chance that 'I' could use some of the design elements of Besperk on the next product we're building cuz it looks nice and I can showcase it to a broader audience.

And if the libraries you're using are slow, maybe you're measuring the wrong thing ;)<p>My biggest gripe with Java is that it is basically useless for anything other than big-scale web applications. And for those kinds of apps, many companies still go for C++.<p>I mean really, for scripting the startup time makes you want to puke. For desktop apps, I've never seen a Java application that I liked because the GUI toolkits available are brain-dead, and because Java apps have this nasty habit of freezing the interface in response to user events. Also, all Java apps are freakishly huge in regards to memory usage. I've seen Python apps that are tolerable, but nerver Java. Eclipse, the golden example, makes me want to hurt myself.<p>For small web apps you can get decent performance out of Python/Ruby/PHP on a 512MB VPS -- 200 reqs/sec at least is really not a problem. If you need more than that, it means you're successful, so why not throw money at it?<p>What else? Android is using its own VM that's not-Java. This means you cannot use libraries that do bytecode manipulation, and is essentially what <a href=""http://www.ikvm.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ikvm.net/</a> is doing on top of .NET or Mono.<p>So in what cases does Java really bring value?<p>Don't get me wrong; I would love to see Mono being popular for web apps for instance -- it's a kick-ass open-source VM, with performance mostly on par with Java, but using less resources and being a better citizen on Unix (kind of ironic if you think about the roots of Java).",1318486431

He was pretty respectful of our set-up crew, asking our opinions about how to place stuff rather than just ordering us around, and offered us sodas and sandwiches. In contrast, most customers just ordered us around and were sort of rude to us.

Banks know this game. Banks also know the position that the fed is in, and what decisions it must make. I can agree that Krugman is likely the wrong target, but I still don’t' think that Keynesianism is. Wouldn't you agree that the majority of the mess we're in right now was and is caused by misapplied Keynesian theory? Misapplied subsidies, interest rates, monetary policy? What I'm trying to understand still is how anyone believes (including Krugman) that Keynesian theory can ever be successful in a political system as we have now or in a banking system as we have now. The fed has simply been a tool for achieving whatever Washington and corporate elites plan next. I have a hard time believing it will ever be anything but. Taking that power away from Government and living with natural fluctuations in the economy seems a far better option.<p>We got off the original track here… I can tell you why this original post sparked my interest, and it’s that I was angered by #OWS’s attacking business and corporations, when the vast majority of them (my employer) are innocent and profoundly important. I was intrigued by your reply but I disagreed that they weren’t attacking manufacturing or retail. What else is “corporate greed”? Then you stated that the “ Federal Reserve is funneling free money to banks” and I thought, of course they are. I kept hearing Krugman’s arguments that they didn’t do this or didn’t do that…and my thought was, when are you (Krugman) going to realize that they aren’t going to? When will you realize that this theory will never be applied in a manner that is actually helpful?  As long as we live in a divided state, with a fed that is manipulated and a banking industry that is guaranteed by their importance to the fed philosophy… the application will always create messes like this one. I firmly believe the next one will be even bigger.<p>Krugman may be right on his grievances, but I think he’s wrong to ever believe it will be done right. We simply keep getting left with fewer and fewer options.",1318485783

What happened is that the gene construct seems to have jumped from Brassica to charlock in a single plant, which wasn&#x27;t able to produce seed. Contrary to what the article claims charlock is a relatively close relative, being in the same family Brassicaceae. You can even get that from the name - all mustards are Brassicas, and charlock is also called field mustard. The current Latin name for charlock is Sinapis arvensis, but it used to be Brassica arvensis!<p>What the article mixes up with using the term &quot;superweeds&quot; is that (practically identical with antibiotics in humans) you create new selection pressures for other plants by using herbicides. When you seed GM-plants you can use new herbicides (or use these more indiscriminately) which slowly creates weeds that are resistant, just like we made antibiotics-resistant bacteria in humans. These are now commonly called &quot;superweeds&quot; (again, a very unlucky term). You could leave GM out of the picture and say that these weeds have been created by herbicide (mis-)use.<p>Since 2005, many more cases of gene flow between GM plants and wild plants have been observed. Are these &quot;bad&quot;? In this case herbicide resistance is not very beneficial to the host plants outside of fields, so these plants are outperformed by others without the modification, as they&#x27;re wasting resources. Is this bad for the species? Cross-species gene flow happens, and it depends on the case whether it&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.<p>Actual paper: <a href=""http://cms.daegu.ac.kr/sgpark/plant%20biotechnology/GMHT%20transfer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cms.daegu.ac.kr/sgpark/plant%20biotechnology/GMHT%20t...</a>",1441532128

These two wrecked havoc at their pleasure after the war and the largely unsuccessful &quot;Arab Springs&quot; (some legitimate, some fabricated by the mentioned 2 new dominant players).

I have a keyboard-case for it, so writing a few letters or stuff like that is fairly straightforward and without much hassle.<p>It comes down on what &quot;producing&quot; means for you. I am a developer. Yes, I can code even on my iPhone (code editor, ssh client, git client is installed), but i&#x27;m much more productive on an actual mac.<p>If you&#x27;re kinda office worker that uses mainly office software (word, excel, ...) and messaging (mail, slack, ...), an iPad with optional keyboard is perfectly capable as a primary working device, plus it&#x27;s extremely portable and may even have mobile data plans attached.",1441530794

You just sit down and use it if it&#x27;s the same as everyone else&#x27;s. No embarrassing prodding and arguing with a basic keyboard. This was a killer for me in the end so I bought a shit Cherry G83 about a decade ago and have used that ever since. $20 well spent. Wonderful keyboard.",1441530783

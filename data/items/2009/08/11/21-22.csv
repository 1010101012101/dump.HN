I can't remember right now but I had particular issues when trying to do the same thing a year or so ago and it turns out that its not W3 spec. Without the inner p tag creating a display block element the grid breaks down.

Try instead comparing Crysis to the effects from a modern blockbuster, which have to hold up well when compared to the live action shots.<p>Ditching the fixed-function pipeline isn't all about realism, though.  More flexibility will allow more experimentation with non-photorealistic rendering.  Maybe we'll see more games with graphics that look like they were painted or drawn.<p>Another benefit of more flexible rendering should be easier game development.  Writing a complete renderer from scratch will be hard but most games will use middleware for that.  The most expensive part of a modern game is the art, and a flexible renderer could do a lot to make generating that art easier.<p>I do share your pet theory about Larrabee trying to avoid stepping on toes at Intel by labeling themselves a GPU.

If they want your home, they will seize it.<p>Arguing that the government needs to jump through hoops is some sort of defence to you isn't relevant. They can and do jump through those hoops all the time, and home-owners are left with assessed values that certainly don't reflect the value of the home <i>to them</i>.<p>In the Greek system, the home-owner can arbitrarily decide what their home means to them, by assigning a value to it themselves. I'm not sure how you take this to mean that the government will suddenly decide to buy up undervalued homes throughout the city. That doesn't make any sense. The government is not a real estate firm, and there is no benefit to them or the taxpayers to saddle themselves with property instead of taking a short of a few hundred dollars, which they will more than make up from people who <i>do</i> value their homes. They'll continue to act as they always have, Rezoning and developing as they see fit. In this case however, people will be offered fair value for their homes - fair, because they've priced the house themselves.<p>So to answer you question, if your house is truly worth so much to you that you would be crushed if the government decided to build a highway where you live, yes, you do price it a 200% (and pay the taxes as such). The Greek system gives you this choice. Under current North American systems, you'll get the assessed value and be told to bugger off. If you're really lucky this will happen during a recession when your assessed value is lower and most construction projects occur. If you're really, really lucky they'll build something next to your lot, force you to take them to court, then offer to settle at the <i>new, post development</i> assessed price.<p>The Greek system wins in my mind in all cases where a government would look to seize property from an owner.",1250025382

Domains would become like oiled pool balls so slick and slippery that no one would be able to keep ahold of them long enough to do anything useful with them. That is, without massively overpaying taxes on them to insure they couldn't be taken at any time.<p>I think one of the most important things about private property is not necessarily that you can demand its fair value when you sell it, but rather that you alone can decide whether it is for sale in the first place.<p>From my way of thinking, domain squatting certainly isn't a dignified way to make a living or something to be proud of, and it's certainly a pain in the ass to everyone else, but I think it certainly is within the rights of those who choose to do it. Who cares if someone has a better use for a domain name? If you bought it, it's yours whether anyone else like it or not.<p>You might argue that squatting is not within the rights of those who do it — according to ICANN regulations — but then I would say that there's already process in place to resolve those sort of disagreements.

My previous lappy had a glossy screen, and I simply couldn't use it outside, and it's one of the reasons I didn't buy an Apple laptop when I got a new one a couple of months ago (bought a Dell Latitude with a super bright matte screen that works <i>great</i> indoors and out).<p>I think saying, ""Glossy screens reflect much of that light away, leaving the screen still legible"" is magical thinking.  The reflected light goes into your eye, just like the light that's coming from the screen.<p>A sufficiently bright glossy screen and placing the lappy out of direct sunlight could overcome this problem, but I'm pretty darned sure matte screens work better than shiny ones outdoors.",1250024795

Let them know that you're genuinely interested in the field and they may be able to hook you up with a good undergrad research project (and publishable paper) and a little grant money. They can help you figure out grad school plans, if you want, and can either help you get funded to stay there or refer you to other universities where they know people.",1250024640

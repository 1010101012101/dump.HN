6792272,comment,6792057,6792057,42,0,scottfr,,,"The author brings up an interesting example where Google Now provides him a tool to automatically identify and describe a TV show he is watching at night. When he later tries to demo this feature to his friend during the day, it simply does not appear.<p>The author takes this as an example of Google Now being very smart and learning from his behavior. It knows he watches TV at night so it provides him the identification feature during that time period. It doesn&#x27;t provide it to him during the day, because it knows he isn&#x27;t usually watching TV during the day (at least this is the author&#x27;s assumption).<p>I take away a different message from this example and it is part of the reason I am very skeptical of software like Siri or Google Now.<p>Fundamentally I believe the one of the most important features of a software application is that it is predictable. When I do &#x27;X&#x27;, I expect the program to do &#x27;Y&#x27; always. If it can&#x27;t do &#x27;Y&#x27; because of certain situations, I should get an explicit, informative error message.<p>The author&#x27;s TV example is an illustration of deep unpredictability. It is quite possible that he is right and there are powerful learning algorithms driving the Google Now&#x27;s behavior in this case. But all I see is unpredictability.<p>Yes, I want to customize and shape software to my own identity and patterns. But unless I control that process, I am likely to become very frustrated, very fast as a software application changes under my feet.",1385348384

I was amazed!<p>The first thing that amazed me was that Google understood what I meant by vidyarthi bhavan! Note vidyarthi bhavan is a generic phrase in many Indian languages which just means &#x27;student building.&#x27; In <i>Bangalore</i>, it refers to a specific restaurant in Gandhi Bazar famed for its masala dosas. And I bet there are plenty of people who live in Bangalore right now and don&#x27;t know about this restaurant. The contextual knowledge here is amazing. And it wasn&#x27;t just geolocation, I was about 15km away from Gandhi Bazar at that point. And Bangaloreans will know corresponds to an eternity given the traffic situation. And the software did all this by recognizing a phrase consisting of two words, both of which are not in English!<p>That moment was an epiphany for me, it the precise moment that I realized that personal digital assistants are here, and they <i>actually</i> work.",1385348343

6792263,comment,6790399,6792070,10,0,destroyAllCable,,,"Here in NYC with TWC, I threw cable in the garbage when my subscription for TV and internet (<i>ONLY</i>, no VOIP service) exceeded $150 a month. I didn&#x27;t even have premium service. This was in 2010, I think.<p>One month I saw the bill and I wanted to punch a hole in the wall.<p>They run a wire to my house, so that the TV reception is better than an aerial antenna. That&#x27;s what cable is. That&#x27;s what cable does.<p>The internet service was rock solid, but when they bombard me with a constant deluge of ads offering introductory service at $99 dollars a month (for TV, VOIP and internet), every ten minutes, no matter what channel I&#x27;m watching, basically, I expect my bill to be $66 dollars for TV and internet only, AT ALL TIMES.<p>This is the same psychological process where we rationalize to ourselves that $99 is cognitively less than $100, so it must be a reasonable truth that I&#x27;m paying a better price than $100, if I&#x27;m only paying $99.<p>If they know who I am, because they know whether to enable my cable signal, based on whether I&#x27;ve paid my bill, and they show <i>ME</i> advertisements on <i>MY</i> TV, stating that I can get 3 things for a price divisible by three ($99), when we both know I&#x27;m only buying 2 things from them, then cognitively, we both know I should be paying 2/3 of what their hellish TV jingle blasts into my ears every 10 minutes.<p>I&#x27;m sitting at work, humming their damned jingle to myself, as I suffer through my 9 to 5 drudgery. Then I come home check the mail box. There are two bills. Cable and Gas/Electric. The cable is more. It&#x27;s $150 dollars. I&#x27;m subscribed to two thirds of their products, and I&#x27;m humming their incessant jingle to myself about how all three of their products should cost two thirds of what I&#x27;m actually paying for the stinking two thirds of what they offer.<p>The jingle is thus:<p><pre><code>  EYE! OH! DIGITAL CABLE! \n  WATCH A LOTTA CHANNELS!\n  WHENEVER YOU&#x27;RE ABLE!\n  THE PRICE IS NICE! \n  LET ME PUT IT ON THE TABLE!\n  ONLY NINETY NINE DOLLARS WHEN YOU SIGN THE LABEL!!!\n</code></pre>\nThere are trains underground, and I can enter and exit their tunnels twice a day, every day for a month, on trips as long as I can tolerate, and I&#x27;ll pay less for that than cable. Trains underground cost less than cable.<p>Smart phones might be a secret government program engineered to earn the complicity of the citizenry, in volunteering to carry tracking devices on our person 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So what?! It&#x27;s still cheaper than cable!<p>Cable doesn&#x27;t keep me warm in the winter. They don&#x27;t do anything essential to my survival. They don&#x27;t deliver perishable food to my door. Cable TV can burn.",1385348095

Why couldn&#x27;t they choose the program they wanted? And on e they found a program that was acceptable, why did it keep stopping? They actually thought we were punishing them with commercials and could not figure out what they were doing wrong. Interesting to see it through their eyes.",1385344936

There&#x27;s a huge amount of customization there, enough that you should be good to go just by looking through the options there. My favorite is remapping Caps Lock to Left CTRL. Then you can remap Left CTRL to be escape by itself, and CTRL+<yourkey> when pressed with other keys. It&#x27;s very handy in Vim, especially.<p>A couple other recommendations, however:<p>BetterTouchTool: The MBP trackpad has a surprising amount of complexity in terms of recognizing gestures. BTT adds to that . <a href=\"http://www.boastr.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.boastr.net</a><p>Keyboard Maestro: Scripting and advanced keyboard shortcuts.

They brought a new approach that earned them attention and customers, and the rest is history. They did good engineering, but so did countless companies that failed or continue in obscurity. I suppose that is the &quot;heavy lifting&quot;?<p>Pointcast obviously was doing good engineering (they had an engineering scale that was pretty much unprecedented at the time), but their business case completely fell apart and the organization was dissolved. There were literally zero issues with the engineering of Pointcast, nor were they replaced by competitors (despite that apparently being your angle?). It simply wasn&#x27;t a viable business at the time, and they couldn&#x27;t find a way to make money.",1385344872

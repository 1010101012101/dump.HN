I got a tiny pop-up which was blocked by Firefox's popup blocker. I think there are ways to fix this so the pop-up does not get blocked when clicking on the link.<p>I set FF to allow the pop-up, and then got a blank window (not sure if this is a problem with the site or with FF). I closed the window, and clicked on the chat link again, at which point I did get a pop-up asking me to login or register. At this point, I just gave up.<p>I would strongly recommend <i>not</i> requiring registration for this type of application.",1258984799

In those few short days Node has highlighted to me just how dramatic of an impact a tool that is close to your language/model of choice can have on your ability to rapidly turn ideas into working code. For a cross section of coders that work with jQuery all day, Node will be a big deal.<p>Node has some really friendly and highly productive people working behind it, chief among them Ryan Dahl ( <a href=""http://github.com/ry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ry</a> ). To learn Node's ins and outs and have some fun, I spent this weekend building out a simple node-based MapReduce-like work unit processor and needed a lot of random help along the way. When I needed gzip ( <a href=""http://github.com/waveto/node-compress"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/waveto/node-compress</a> ), or to communicate with Unix command processes, or a redis client ( <a href=""http://github.com/fictorial/redis-node-client/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/fictorial/redis-node-client/</a> ), the Node community was there to help me very quickly.<p>Simply said, Node.js is a very productive and fun environment for weekend hacks, and I expect it to become a primary fixture in my toolbox in the coming months.<p>[edit: added links]",1258984543

957318,comment,956884,957284,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is the crux. Socialism/communism as implemented bears little resemblance to the utopian vision, instead of utopia the result is human tragedy on a grand scale. This has happened so many times that it's unlikely to be mere accidental correlation (Stalinist USSR, communist Eastern Europe, China under Mao, North Korea, Cuba under Castro, Myanmar under the Junta, etc.)<p>And yet, because the vision and practice differ so much this provides a ready excuse for every new generation of socialist utopians to put forward the theory that those historical examples were not really, truly faithful implementations of socialism/communism. Rather than the more realistic theory that utopian socialism is impractical and unstable, and when attempted to be implemented it inherently degrades into the totalitarian examples we've seen so many times from history.<p>My contention is only that this line of reasoning is dangerous and harmful, and that socialist ideas deserve far more skepticism in public debate than they typically receive.",1258984408

(Don't want to link-pimp as I need to enhance/edit, but you can check my profile if you're interested).<p>It's my opinion that JS is the new lingua franca of programming, and it's about time we replaced C/Java. It has consistent syntax, some great functional aspects, dynamic typing, and it's now become a top target for optimization by some of the world's smartest engineers.<p>Breaking into systems coding is the next step, IMO, in JS becoming a legitimate option for ""anything"" programming. I think node.js is going to be the library for it. It's really idiomatic and concise, and it's got just the right amount of opinionatedness I think to become the systems and JS version of Rails.",1258982979

Add to that the increasing presence of traditional media content, e.g. Hulu, that have been able to leverage conventional marketing to drive users to their sites.<p>Most of these sites are likely no longer heavily dependent on search to attract users. These sites may be willing to delist from Google in exchange for a direct revenue stream.  If they do, it will diminish the value of not just Google, but of web search in general.<p>This may be a strategy to fragment search as a primary driver of web traffic, and create an incumbent advantage for content providers and web services with high traditional brand awareness, such as its own, at the expense of startups which continue to rely on search to build their user base.",1258982453

It's a fantastic city, but it absolutely is difficult to maintain friendships, despite everyone being incredibly nice. There was a HackerNews meetup several months ago; Reddit has a decent mix of impromptu, planned, and recurring meetups; and Meetup.com usually has atleast a couple good options every week. It's easy to meet people here, but there aren't many venues for seeing them often enough to turn it into a friendship. Essentially, if you and someone you get along with go to the same meetup monthly, and you can't make it one month, and they can't make it the next month, you end up with a 90 day gap between seeing eachother. I don't know if this is any different in NYC or SF though?<p>All said, if anyone wants to plan a meetup or just wants to grab a beer, my email's in my profile.",1367686718

5655451,comment,5655038,5655361,11,0,georgemcbay,,,"Google search for me (and I've been using it a very long time, having been an Internet user since the late 1980s and around when Google first appeared) has generally gotten worse over time, not better.  I don't think the changes are to sell more advertising, though, I think they are a combination of:<p>1) The web is just much bigger and noisier than it ever was.  There are so many SEO-bait sites out there now, it is a wonder search still works at all.  I can't really fault Google for this part.<p>2) Changes Google made to make search more accessible to the mainstream user.  Google search now tries way too hard to be ""smart"" about what the user meant to ask for instead of what he or she actually asked for and this can be a huge negative if the person is looking up precise information and knows how to use a search engine.<p>They somewhat recently added a ""Verbatim"" option to search that can help you avoid some of this too-smartness, but even with that enabled Google is still inferior to what it used to be when I'm looking for very targeted technical information that I am sure exists out there.<p>Sadly, this sort of thing is a trend impacting not just Google.  The success of Apple has created a culture of creating things for the mainstream consumer user which often comes at the expense of the power user.  I get why this is done and ultimately it is the right call for any business that could potentially serve the mainstream, but I do wish more companies would leave in the highly technical expert options as settings for those who are comfortable using them.  I feel that in recent times most software in general has swung way too far on the pendulum from being too hard for normal people to use to being totally gimped for experts and feeling like a toy more than a tool and I wish attempts to try to support both sets of users became a ""thing"" instead of constantly hearing the mantra that ""options or settings are bad, no options or settings for you""!",1367686699

Wasn't it Java based technologies that were suppose to usher in ""thin client"" platforms that everyone would give up their desktop boxes for? The technology is better for something like this to occur these days, and maybe it's time. However, it took us quite awhile to go from something like the Newton to where we are today with the iPhone 5. There was quite a bit of iterating and consumer experimentation going on between then and now.  The only consumer oriented success stories for cloud or network computing are remote desktop and backup services, which are more business oriented and certainly aren't threatening standard PCs.<p>Edit: I guess the main gist of this product is that it's remote desktop in your browser, without any plugins, and it can provide you with a full desktop experience, while boasting a light bandwidth footprint even with HD video applications. It also seems to allow you to tap in to cloud based computing infrastructure at the same time. While neat, it seems niche, and unlikely to rule the desktop. It also doesn't seem efficient to have an office full of computers streaming a remote desktop of MS Office, instead of just running it natively.",1367686677

Some of this information is from Gartner Group and the rest can easily be verified by doing even a brief survey of the field. Taking the following bits of information:<p>* 75% of the world's business data passes through COBOL (Gartner Group estimate)<p>* There is possibly up to a fifth of a trillion lines of COBOL code out there (Gartner again)<p>* People are still writing COBOL constantly, but usually on existing systems.<p>* The industry is struggling to find new COBOL programmers because few young programmers love the thought of maintaining decades-old enterprise systems where all data is global and GOTO is often the first choice in flow control.<p>* Many companies want to move from COBOL, but can't do so easily because too much code is written in COBOL (and the source is often lost).<p>People really, really underestimate these problems. For example, I've seen several companies express a desire to move away from Perl but find out they can't because they don't realize quite how reliant on the language they are.<p>Now imagine a multi-national corporation with several million lines of COBOL code. What are they going to do?<p>COBOL salaries, from what I've seen, are trending upwards. Older programmers are sometimes being enticed out of retirement to maintain legacy systems (this is rather hit or miss as there appears to still be some age discrimination here). There are companies out there offering software to allow COBOL programmers to write NetBeans, integrate with .NET code or simply translate the COBOL into other languages (the latter appears to have mostly been a disaster, but I don't have enough hard data on this).<p>So let's summarize the above:<p>* Trillions of dollars flow through COBOL.\n* Trillions of dollars flow through systems that businesses want to replace.\n* Current mitigation strategies involve supplementing COBOL, not replacing it.<p>You come up with a strategy to allow COBOL systems to naturally migrate to a new language and you stand to make <i>millions</i> of dollars. By the way, I said ""naturally"". There are things like COBOL to Java translators (e.g., <a href=""http://opencobol2java.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencobol2java.sourceforge.net/</a>), but COBOL is procedural and all variables are global. It doesn't even come close to mapping to an object-oriented paradigm (and any experienced OO programmer will understand why).<p>I actually have what I think is a decent migration strategy for COBOL, but that's a story for another day.",1367686181

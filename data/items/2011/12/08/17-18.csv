You don't want them competing for the same CPU if you know ahead of time you can allocate a CPU for each one of them.<p>Another reason is caching. For example you can assign a CPU to process network interrupt requests from a particular network device.

3330123,comment,3329676,3329928,2,0,nkoren,,,"Good point, well made. In reality, the situation in your example of a multi-line queue is not usually as dire as your example portrays, because the delayed people in queue #1 are likely to jump ship sometime after the other two queues. have cleared. Nonetheless, this queue-jumping behaviour confuses the circulation pattern and causes congestion in the vicinity of the tills, which itself slows down the throughput. There's no doubt that a single-file call-forward queue is more efficient for both the customers and the shop.<p>One point I didn't see made in the article: single-file queues are also a fair amount more space-efficient, which has value to retailer that is separate from the issue of throughput. This spatial opportunity cost is something that also needs to be considered when designing a queuing system.<p>I've seen subtle & sophisticated studies which do say that customers prefer multi-line queues to single-line queues, but I rarely see any that bring the other factors into play. Retailers really should base their decisions on the following formula:<p>average revenue per customer * (% improved customer throuhgput - % of customers you'll lose because of multi-line queues) + extra retail m^2 * average revenue per m^2<p>In most cases, you'll find that that the value of a single-line queue is a good deal greater than the value of a multi-line queue. So this is one of those cases where it's likely a good idea to <i>not</i> cater to customer preferences.<p>(I'll also note that single-line queues are much more common here in the UK than in the US; I've become quite accustomed to them and in fact dread multi-line queues and the inevitable idiots that I get stuck behind in them. It seems likely to me that a large part of the American aversion to them is simply a bias against the unfamiliar; this is likely to subside as they become more accustomed to it.)",1323366415

If you want to read a detailed book on it, Fundamentals of Queueing theory by Thompson et al is the bible.<p>A couple of additional thoughts, pooling queues like this only works if the changeover time to process different types of things is low.  So in the case of a grocery store where there is no separate changeover or batch setup time it works well.  If you are pooling work to people though it breaks down if only certain people can do certain types of work or the change over time to switch to a different task exceeds a certain threshold.<p>The other thing is the title of this post is almost certainly incorrect.  Switching to a single queue reduces average queue time, but it does not reduce work time.  In order to be 3x faster you would have to reduce both.  The other factor at play is that people continuously rebalance from slow lines to fast lines, which also helps mitigate some of the problems.<p>* some grammatical edits",1323366172

Perhaps this is my east coast conservatism, but in the average case I just can't see how this works out well for the investors.<p>To get a respectable exit of perhaps $4B in a few years they would have to get their revenue up to something closer to $200M/year assuming you gave them a generous valuation on 20x revenue and completely neglect profitability. Given that Evernote primarily makes money from paid users they will need to dramatically improve conversion, or somehow figure how to get 10x more users. 200 million users strikes me as unlikely, and doubling conversion while also getting 100 million users does too.

A bus or train requires waiting, makes various stops, does not take a direct route to your destination, and drops you some distance away from where you want, perhaps with a couple of transfers required for long distances.<p>Car sharing programs eliminate some of the drawbacks (no detours or stops), but several still apply (no guarantee of timely availability, one or both endpoints does not coincide perfectly with your destination).  On top of those, you also pay more than mass transit, and you still have to do the driving.<p>Give me a transit mechanism which picks me up from my house at the time I want to leave, and takes me directly to my destination with no stops, and I see no reason to ever drive a car again.<p>I certainly believe that some car enthusiasts exist who actually driving, rather than just doing it to get to a destination.

However, I think it's important to stress that quitting your job to do this is <i>not</i> the only way for <i>us</i> to do this (as he says in the article.)<p>From the article:<p>> [Staying with your job and working on your idea at nights and weekends] seems to be an option because you always hear about ventures starting out as side-projects built on late nights and weekends. Well, I only have a few hours of focus every day. By midnight, I just blankly stare at my screen. Maybe it works for you, but it took me 2 years to figure out it does not work for me.<p>You know, some of us <i>make</i> it work for the same reason the author quit his job: We don't feel there is another good option. I have 2 kids, wife stays home, and we have a mortgage. I don't feel I have any choice <i>but</i> to keep my full time job. So we make it work. (Yesterday I worked a solid day at my company, came home, ate dinner, spent some time with both the kids and my wife, then put in a solid 8 hours on my own product trying to touch up the marketing site and get a major new feature up for some new customers. I got to bed a little after 5 AM. It's hard work, but again, I feel it's this or nothing.)<p>The only recommendation I would make to someone who feels they <i>must</i> quit their job in order to do a project like this: You may want to try and find a better company to work for that is more compatible with this sort of work and your goals. Flexible schedule and an understanding manager, for example, makes a huge difference. That allows you to work all night when you've got the urge, motivation, or potential customer, and still be successful in the job that pays the mortgage. In 4 years at my last job, I was never able to get a product of my own out the door. I had one out the door within about 7 months of joining the consulting company I work for now.",1323364698

Samsung tellies are noticeably unique. When it comes to small cameras one can easily say that a camera is a 3d rectangle with a lens but if you look at Sammy's NX100/200 series you'll see they went out of their way to make the camera look unique by giving it a curved face rather than flat.<p>On the general topic, I remember being interested in tablets early on when they were a Microsoft thing and none of them looked like an iPad. Now almost all tablets look iPad like. Samsung in particular seemed to have gone out of their way to make a product that mimicked the look of an iPad. That being said, I'm sad that Apple has taken to the courts over these small issues. The best way to have a leading product is to make a leading product and then continually improving it so that customers want to buy it. This Apple does well.

Each person takes 1m to checkout except the first guy takes 10m.  With three lines it looks like this (these are their wait times before being serviced):<p><pre><code>   0   0   0  (first person in each line has no wait time)\n   10  1   1\n   11  2   2\n</code></pre>\nIf you sum up the total wait times you get: 27m<p>Now do this with a single file line with three cashiers:<p><pre><code>   0   (first three people have no wait time)\n   0\n   0\n   1   (only two people get processed at a time now)\n   1\n   2\n   2\n   3\n   3</code></pre>\nWhat you see is that one guy basically blocked one of the cashiers for the whole time, but the other two cashiers could continue to process.  The total wait time:  12m<p>Change the numbers and you can create different factors for which the single file line is more efficient.<p>EDIT: Made a typo the first time on the wait times for the 3-line scenario.

If you have N people come into your  store, you're going to have to check them all out at some point.  The problem is that if you always have enough cashiers to help people as soon as they are ready, you'll be paying cashiers to stand around during lulls.  Stores try to avoid this by moving cashiers to other jobs when there's a lull, but this only helps for fluctuations with timescales long compared to the time it takes to start and finish a job.<p>hrabago's point is important, but it certainly doesn't justify the linkbait title.

The point can best be illustrated using the same approach that a judge did in one of the hearings; if you hold up any of the devices prior to the iPad and an iPad and ask a typical consumer to identify which one is the iPad, there is no question as to which one they'd instantly pick. Do the same with a a Galaxy 10.1 and iPad and I'm not so sure the same individual could immediately differentiate the two, in fact Samsung's lawyer couldn't identify which was which, kind of proving Apple's point. Do the same with pretty much every other tablet on the market and there is a significant enough difference to recognise which is an iPad in an instance, as illustrated by your picture. That's not to say Apple's approach is either valid or particularly warranted, however as an industrial designer looking at both products in the knowledge that one followed the other, I find it hard to believe that Samsung haven't be substantially ""influenced"" by Apple's design language; to the extent that were these design degree submissions, I'd be investigating plagiarism.",1323363796

3329880,comment,3327202,3327202,7,0,x03,,,"The pilots, mostly, acted legitatemly based on the flawed and lacking data of which they were presented with.<p>Initially, the captain's non-fear of the storm was based on incorrect weather data based on a mis-configured radar system. His data seemingly grossly underestimated the severity of the weather: had he had the correct data originally he would almost definitely, like every other pilot in the region, known to avoid the area to which they eventually flew into. As soon as the radar was configured correctly, the pilots banked left to avoid it as best they could. How common a misconfigured radar is and how easily it is done is perhaps the most vital piece of information here. No aircraft should be allowed to fly with such important data being incorrect, ever. This needs to be checked and re-checked far better in future. It is the original link in this fatal chain. It was wrong data, not a wrong human assessment of data, that started off this crash sequence. Given the original radar data, the captain made the right call. And there's nothing obsentibly wrong with him going to take a nap, insofar as that's typical protocol.<p>Due to flying into the wrong weather-zone, the autopilot turns itself off. And that's that from there. Given that this is such a rare event it's notification is relatively minor within the grand scheme of fear and confusion that one would expect to exist for such an event that so drastically affects flying itself. There exists such a massive difference between autopilot and pilot-driven flying that there needs to be an unignorable physical presentation difference between the two: perhaps gently vibrating the control stick, changing the entire colour of the cabin (to, say, orange) using some LEDs and even changing the posture of a pilot's seat to a more upright position to subtly but distincly make for a different ""feel"" to computer-led flying. You'd just know based on these indicators alone. Perhaps it'd be harder to mentally block the stall warnings based on the notion that ""we can't be stalling, the airliner won't let us"" when it feels like you're personally in control of the whole airliner. They didn't just ""ignore"" the 70+ stall warnings, they completely ignored the very idea that it was possible for them to be stalling at all.<p>Addressing either of these two issues alone could have helped save AF447. Evaluating the other problems presented, like why two pilots can input vastly different instructions through their joysticks with both being in ignorance of one another clearly needs to be addressed (perhaps even a weighted average towards the more experienced pilot's input rather than a straight up average?); why there existed no clear chain-of-command; why the captain didn't get back quickly enough and how to ""force"" captains to be quicker; the best way to brief exactly what you've been doing more quickly; and perhaps a new technology that's basically ""Clippy"" for flying, that could say things like ""You're in a stall, consider pointing down?""<p>This was a tragic mistake that ought not to have happen. Based on so much, let's not so easily condemn the pilots actions to stupidity and instead take a moment to consider the sheer horror they suffered after commanding such a massively complex machine in such challenging conditions with so much noise, lights and general ""WTF""-ness.<p>Consider that environment the next time you get frustrated investigating a non-obviousl compile error in your quiet, air-conditioned, well-lit office.",1323363650

409866,comment,408786,409815,0,0,markessien,,,"Imagine a society with 30 million waitresses and 5 farmers. Those extra waitresses are useless, and such a society cannot work. The other way round - 30 million farmers and 5 waitresses - people will serve themselves and there will be a lot of excess food to be exported.<p>Service industries that function as an add-on for a manufacturing industry needs to be specifically calibrated to the volume of the industry, otherwise the excess is wastage. The other way round does not hold.<p>You have to understand what fundamental value in a world economy is. A waitress is no value, a programmer is a lot of value, and a guy working in the financial industry is basically the same as a waitress. He's an add-on for other industries, and the volume has to be calibrated also.<p>If a country produces a car out of some metal in a mine, it created real value, irrelevant of if this car was exported or not. If a country produces a waitress who can be trained in 2 days and simply moves food from one place to another, the value it created is really minimal.<p>I'm not saying that the service industry in the U.S is too small or too large, I don't know enough about it to say. I'm just saying that the backbone of any stable and real economy lies in constantly creating real value.",1230253039

It seems tricky to specify the goal clearly, so the crows are trained to find only ""lost"" money. Perhaps only reward them for coins that were on the ground? As opposed to in someone's pocket, purse, on a shop counter, in a cash register, in a bank... hmm, this experiment could end badly.<p>Crows more intelligent than monkeys, he claims in the following (1 min) video.

Philosophy is also a way to make technology solutions easier.<p>I see no conflict between using the same tool for both types of work. However I would not go so far as to say both types of work are identical. As a deep pragmatist, I pick and choose philosophies of living and idea development concentrating on what works and ditching what doesn't. It doesn't matter to me that on different projects, or on different days, different philosophies which might be mutually contradictory are required. Philosophy is always a work in progress. I have a small enough moral sense that stealing what works isn't a problem and a small enough ego that I don't worry with trying to come up with the ultimate philosophy of everything.",1230249983

""I will not write rants anymore"" would be grammatically correct, however. Just a bit of constructive criticism. :)",1230249764

If you didn't sound so serious I would think your comment is meant to be a parody.<p>> Very little of this is actually true, at least with regards to what the U.S. does internally.<p>The majority of the OP's comment is not about domestic US politics, it's about support of dictatorships abroad.  I'm guessing you are not very familiar with the history of Latin america, you should read up on that before making comments like this again.  By the way, the US backed ex-president of Guatemala was just found guilty of genocide[1], Hillary Clinton said Egypt's dictator Mubarak was a ""friend of her family"", and the US strongly backs the regime in Saudi Arabia which is one of the most repressive in the entire middle east.  When Madeleine Albright was asked if she thought the death of half a million Iraqi children due to the sanctions was too high a price to pay, she said ""I think...the price is worth it""[2].<p>> The U.S. government very rarely ignores the Constitution<p>Are you aware that it was recently revealed that Henry Kissinger was recorded saying ""The illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer""[3]  Or are you familiar with the regime of secret law that surrounds drone assassinations, do you think that just because the president can get his lawyer to write him a permission slip that it makes assassinating US citizens abroad constitutional?  What about locking people up in Guantanamo bay without a trial?  What about torture?  What about the 4th amendment.  Do you even know which one that is, or why that is relevant to the article about spying on reporters from AP?  What about freedom of the press?<p>> As for externally--the Constitution puts almost no limits on the American government's ability to intervene in foreign affairs<p>Have you even read the constitution?  It doesn't sound like it.  The entire point of the constitution is to constrain the ability of the government to do things.  It says that the government is bound by all foreign treaties[4].  It also happens to say that congress is the only body of government that can declare war, even though after Vietnam that clause has pretty much been ignored.<p>>  as far as global hegemons go, the U.S. is the most benevolent such entity in the history of the world<p>are you serious?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/13/us-guatemala-riosmontt-idUSBRE94C13V20130513"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/13/us-guatemala-riosm...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM0uvgHKZe8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM0uvgHKZe8</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://rt.com/news/wikileaks-assange-release-files-475/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rt.com/news/wikileaks-assange-release-files-475/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Six_of_the_United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Six_of_the_United_State...</a>",1368507537

By getting involved with an established organization, individuals can often take advantage of its existing resources, increasing the likelihood that whatever is contributed will produce an ROI.<p>Obviously there's no absolute guarantee of this, and I wouldn't suggest that there's no room for new organizations, but new non-profits are a lot like new businesses: most do not ""succeed"", and a lot of the ones that don't fail outright plod along and never achieve what was hoped for. It doesn't take more than a quick read of a few random Form 990 filings to see this.<p>So to put it simply: you <i>do not</i> need to start your own thing to help solve big problems. People who have the itch to save the world would be wise to consider that they are far more likely to make a bigger impact by channeling their time, money, passion and ideas to organizations that have been saving the world for years.",1368507178

They do not understand anyone who doesn't share their passion to achieve the highest number of dollars or yuan or yen or rupees.<p>The real test of belief comes at the end of your life, but during the middle part you believe what you believe.<p>Consequently any story of following one's passion rather than money will be discounted by folks who don't share that belief, and any story of finding ways to get richer and richer will be discounted by folks who don't share that belief.

So I'm sure that ""online transactions"" was about as boring to an aspiring space entrepreneur as ""online shopping"" is to you, Weston.<p>Anyway, decisions other people make often look weird to people observing from the peanut gallery - most of all when you make a decision that feels so right it's almost impossible to ""unmake"" you usually know that, for whatever reason and with whatever reasoning, you've made the right decision for you, now.<p>On the topic of solving the world's water problems, I'm reminded of a documentary I saw years ago by a Ghanaian national in Nigeria, the name of which escapes me and which I can't find anywhere. It was around the time of the ""make poverty history"" campaign. This guy went to Nigeria and tried to do a few basic things like get a house, find a job, etc. and found that at every turn he was faced by rampant corruption. He even setup an NGO and started accepting foreign aid with very little trouble.<p>The final line in the film is ""If you want to solve poverty, you first have to solve corruption"" which has always stuck with me.<p>I'm mentioning this because it may be the case that ""solving the water problem"" for the majority of people won't be a matter of the (relatively) simple application of technology, but a matter of the much more complex application of political will, diplomacy and grass roots activism. You might already have considered this, but since I remembered the doco I thought I'd mention it, too: sometimes there are problems you have to solve before you solve the problem you really want to solve.",1368506877

I got $400 out of an ATM when I went home to Chicago to visit, and just wandered around the Gold Coast/Magnificent Mile region of the city looking for every hair salon and massage therapy practice I could find. I asked them all if I they took walk-ins and, if so, could I have 30 minutes of the owner's time for whatever the rate was ($30 or so). In lieu of the shoulder massage/etc, I said ""I'm interested in the massage therapy industry. Would you mind if we just chatted for half an hour about it?"" And I asked about how they handled scheduling, appointments, no-shows, etc etc. I also did a demo of my two-page AR mini-app on the iPad and asked if they would be interested in buying it when it was ready.\nI think only one person actually accepted my money for the interviews. I got five-ish ""Please tell me when that is ready"" out of a dozen or so conversations. No Bay Area or signup form required. (I put their emails in a paper notebook. And lost it prior to launch. Whoopsie.)\nThis was mostly successful for me: it confirmed that there was a market willing to pay for AR without me needing to actually build it to demonstrate that. (My sampling technique, which found only massage therapists/hair salons, did sort of lead me off the rails as to who I'd eventually end up targeting for most of the business. D'oh.)</i>",1368505873

CoreOS seems to be a operating system design that is not present in any other distro that I am aware of, and definantly not stripped down Ubuntu.<p>Another interesting OS design I am aware of is NixOS[1], which features a purely functional package management system.<p>For the typical use cases, the answer is, as always, stick with the tried and tested. However there is still plenty of unexplored space that may be superior for specific domains, and might even become superior (or more likely influence) the common case solution.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nixos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/</a>",1375243148

6131813,comment,6124462,6130853,1,0,foobarbazqux,,,"Science is only concerned with what things &#x27;truly&#x27; are.  Anything that is presently an untestable claim - such as the brain having explicit circuitry devoted to our concept of willpower - is not a scientific hypothesis.<p>Measurements tell you about the thing you are measuring and you can do science with them.  However they do not tell you the mechanism by which the thing you are measuring works internally.  For example, when Newton discovered gravity he did not know how gravity worked, so gravity was a black box that he simply measured.  It&#x27;s now a much smaller black box thanks to better experimental methods.  The problem is not making scientific claims about the behavior of the black box, the problem is extrapolating to the point where you&#x27;re claiming that your model of what&#x27;s in the box is the right model, with no way of checking.  Hopefully as neuroscience makes progress we will be able to test our claims about the inside of the brain.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to make it clearer.  As far as fatalism is concerned, some scientists believe that everything since the big bang is predetermined, and choice is an illusion.  It&#x27;s unfalsifiable, but the point is that&#x27;s just as valid as the claim that we actually have willpower.",1375243002

It is not just one function but an entire family of functions with some interesting aspects beyond just the algorithms.<p>The hash functions were algorithmically optimized around a scaffolding I designed that guaranteed certain performance characteristics and easy analyzability. It has literally produced many, many thousands of high quality hash functions. Tens of thousands of CPU hours have been burned on the optimization process, which is still running, and the ones that have been put into use so far were early samples pulled out of that process but the hash functions still being processed in the pipeline are statistically more robust than the earlier versions. Much easier than trying to design them the old fashioned way. At some point soon, since the optimization is converging, I will evaluate the most promising parts of the phase space to select the strongest and most aesthetic functions and publish those into the public domain.",1375242946

Obviously to delve proficiently into every aspect of programming through the ages and why things are the way they are now (e.g. what &#x27;won&#x27; out and why) would require a Course and not a talk.\nYou seem to think that the points brought up in this talk diminish the idea that things now DO work. However, what was stressed was avoiding the trap of discontinuing the pursuit of thinking outside the box.<p>I am also questioning how much of the video you actually paid attention too (note: I am not questioning how much you watched). I say this because your critique is focused on the topics that he covered in the earlier parts of the video and then (LOL) you quickly criticize him for talking about concurrency (in your previous comment)... I clearly remember him talking about programming on Massively Parallel architectures without the need for sequential logic control via multiplexing using threads and locks. I imagine, though, it is possible you did not critique this point because it is obvious (to everyone) that this is the ultimate direction of computing (synchronously with the end of Moores law as well).<p>Ahhh now thats interesting, we are entering an era where there could possibly be a legitimate use to trying/conceiving new methods of programming? Who would have thought?<p>Maybe you just realized that you would have looked extremely foolish spending time on critiquing that point? IDK  excuse my ignorance.<p>Also you constantly argue FOR basic management techniques and methods (as if that countermoves Brets arguments)  but you fail to realize that spatial structuring of programs would be a visual management technique in itself that could THEN too have tools developed along with it that would be isomorphic to modern integration, testing management. But I wont bother delving into that subject as I am much more ignorant on this and more importantly  I would hate to upset you, Master.<p>Oh and btw (before accusations fly) I am not a Hero worshiper  this is the first time I have ever even heard of Bret Victor.

On paper, they&#x27;re all basically the same phone (2G quad core snapdragons with 1920x1080 screens).  But all the tiebreakers (really, all of them) go to the Samsung phone.  The GS4 is slightly smaller, thinner, and lighter yet its screen is slightly larger.  It&#x27;s CPU is clocked higher and its battery is larger.  It&#x27;s cameras are better (much more so than the HTC, slightly more so than the Sony).  It has a removable battery where the others don&#x27;t.  It has a sdcard slot where the HTC doesn&#x27;t.

There was also Suse, but the madness of making everything look like Netware, with standard, classiesc UNIX tools replaced by some home-brew programs with dozens of parameters nobody knew. It died long ago, thank god.<p>The advantage of Debian was that it was de-facto standard academia linux. Which means more-or-less stable and well tested, while some designs were (and still) lame. apt is such a lousy mess compared to RPM.)<p>Then the wave of migration from proprietary UNIXes to cheap Linux systems began, and RHEL flourished, being the OS of choice if you wish to run Oracle or Informix (the second was very impressive and still is). RHEL at that time was actively developed, well-tested, and even went through a painful transition to NTPL.<p>Then good people made CentOS from RHEL&#x27;s sources and nowadays it is still default choice for some stable, but little bit lagging behind the popular distros Linux (it is still on 2.6.x kernels)<p>Then was the raise of Ubuntu. Well, it is popular, which almost never mean good.) Nevertheless for the wast majority Linux = Ubuntu. Leaving aside the crazy habit of incorporation of any new shinny crap invented by freedesktop guys, such as various init, management and settings &quot;services&quot; it is quite stable, and well-tested, indeed. Btw, comparing to the glorious days of 2.4 to 2.6 migration, or that NTPL stuff, there are almost no problem with core libraries and tools.<p>So, does anyone need a new distro? My answer is NO. It is quite easy to reduce CentOS or even Ubuntu (or Fedora, which is also infected by systemd madness) to a minimal and stable set of packages. All you need to do is exclude all Gnome-related stuff with dependencies, keeping image and fonts manipulation libraries, and X11 libs to be able to recompile popular packages.<p>The key idea here is begin with already many times tested sources, such as CentOS .srpm (got through tests by two separate teams) or Ubuntu&#x27;s packages, cutting off unnecessary dependencies. Then you will have compatible and well-tested OS for containers or whatever else sales people call the banal para-virtualization.<p>Setting up your own yum repository is a matter of few hours, Debian packaging is more messy, but manageable. This is what sysadmin&#x27;s job all about.<p>Btw, vendors such as Amazon already have done this job, so if you hate system administration (which is a sign that shopping might be a better future ,) just re-use these images - it is much better than some new &quot;core OS&quot;.<p>The so-called &quot;minimal install&quot; of Ubuntu is also fine, and all you need to do is re-compile important packages, such as MySQL the way you like it and place them to your local repo.",1375241885

He spent years studying various species of animals.  In the book, he begins out very modestly, following step by step from his Christian foundations, without making any outrageous claims. The fossils he collected on his Beagle expedition sparked his interest in the field, and served as good evidence for his theory.<p>> In concurrency maybe it will be ideas from neuroscience.<p>Unlikely, considering what little we know about the neocortex. The brain is not primarily a computation machine at all; it&#x27;s a hierarchical memory system that makes mild extrapolations. There is some interest in applying what we know to computer science, but I&#x27;ve not seen anything concrete so far (read: code; not some abstract papers).<p>> We are only at the beginning of this paradigm shift to massively multi-core CPUs.<p>From the point of view of manufacturing, it makes most sense. It&#x27;s probably too expensive to design and manufacture a single core in which all the transistors dance to a very high clock frequency. Not to mention power consumption, heat dissipation, and failures. In a multi-core, you have the flexibility to switch off a few cores to save power, run them at different clock speeds, and cope with failures. Even from the point of view of Linux, scheduling tons of routines on one core can get very complicated.<p>> In HW there are many promising advances being explored, such as GPUs, Intel Phi, new FPGAs, and projects like Parallella.<p>Ofcourse, but I don&#x27;t speculate much about the distant future. The fact of the matter is that silicon-based x86 CPUs will rule commodity hardware in the foreseeable future.<p>> [...]<p>All this speculation is fine. Nothing is going to happen overnight; in the best case, we&#x27;ll see an announcement about a new concurrent language on HN tomorrow, which might turn into a real language with users after 10 years of work ;)  I&#x27;ll probably participate and write patches for it.<p>For the record, Go (which is considered &quot;new&quot;) is over 5 years old now.",1375241342

You <i>explain your desires</i> to a compiler using a vocabulary as expressive as is possible for it to comprehend, and then <i>it</i> uses whatever intelligence is at its disposal to program the computer. The more intelligent the compiler (e.g. GHC with its stream-fusion), and the more expressive the vocabulary it knows (e.g. Erlang/OTP with its built-in understanding of servers, finite-state machines, and event-handlers) the higher-level the conversation you can have with it is.<p>Your conversation with the compiler is actually the same conversation a client would have with <i>you</i>, as a software contractor. From the client&#x27;s perspective, you play the role of the compiler, interrogating and formalizing their own murky desires for them, and then coughing up a build-artifact for them to evaluate. This conversation just occurs on an even higher level, because a human compiler is smarter, and has a much more expressive vocabulary, than a software compiler.<p>...but the &quot;goal&quot; of compiler and language design should be to make that distinction, between the &quot;software compiler&quot; and the &quot;human compiler&quot;, less obvious, shouldn&#x27;t it? The more intelligence we add to the compiler, and the more expressivity we add to the language, the more directly the programmer can translate the client&#x27;s desires into code. Until, finally, one day--maybe only after we&#x27;ve got strong AI, but one day--the client themselves will be the one speaking to the compiler. Not because the client will be any better at knowing how to formalize what they want than they ever were (that&#x27;s the dream that gave us the abominations of FORTRAN, SQL, and AppleScript) but because the compiler will be able to infer and clarify their murky thoughts into a real, useful design--just as we do now. Wouldn&#x27;t that be nice?<p>---<p> If you use a language-platform that includes garbage-collection, for example, then you&#x27;re not targeting a machine with &quot;limited resources&quot; at all; garbage-collection is intended to simulate an Abstract Machine with <i>unlimited</i> memory.

You essentially need some sort of scheduler to give various threads access to the shm via cas primitives.<p>And that&#x27;s why the new scheduler is written <i>in Rust</i>.<p>Furthermore, manual memory management is helpful when you are implementing a browser that doesn&#x27;t want a stop the world GC.<p>> You&#x27;ve exposed the lower-level rt/sync via libextra/sync.rs, but it&#x27;s frankly not a big improvement over using raw pthreads.<p>It&#x27;s just a wrapper around pthreads, for use internally by the scheduler and low-level primitives. It is not intended for safe Rust code to use. Of course it&#x27;s not a big improvement over pthreads.<p>>  The scheduler is a toy (rt/rust_scheduler.cpp)<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s getting rewritten. You&#x27;re looking at the old proof of concept/bootstrap scheduler. Please see the new scheduler in libstd/rt. It will probably be turned on in a week or two.<p>> and the memory allocator is horribly primitive (rt/memory_region.cpp; did I read correctly? are you using an array to keep track of the allocated regions)<p>There is a new GC that is basically written, just not turned on by default yet. Furthermore, manually-managed allocations no longer go through that list.<p>> Rust really has no way of accomplishing it, because you I don&#x27;t get access to free().<p>Of course you do. `let _ = x;&quot; is an easy way to free any value.<p>> The best you can do at this point is to use some sort of primitive reference counter (not much unlike cpython or shared-pointer in C++), because it&#x27;s too late to implement a tracing garbage collector.<p>This is just nonsense, sorry. Graydon has a working tracing GC, it&#x27;s just not turned on by default because of memory issues on 32 bit when bootstrapping. This is not too difficult to fix and is a blocker for 1.0.<p>Furthermore, did you not see the mailing list discussions where we&#x27;re discussing what needs to happen to get incremental and generational GC?<p>> And you just threw performance out the window by guaranteeing that you will call free() everytime something goes out of scope, no matter how tiny the memory.<p>This is what move semantics are for. If you want to batch deallocations like a GC does (which has bad effects on cache behavior as Linus is fond of pointing out, but anyway), move the object into a list so it doesn&#x27;t get eagerly freed and drop the list every once in a while.<p>> Lastly think about why people use C and C++. Primarily, it boils down to compiler strength. The rust runtime doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s getting there; atleast not in its current shape.<p>The benchmarks of the new runtime are quite promising.

I mean, Microsoft has huge resources, and presumably does testing with focus groups, etc.<p>I&#x27;m sure they do, and I&#x27;m sure they focus-grouped the tablets extensively.<p>But it&#x27;s very hard to convince someone of something that they really, really don&#x27;t want to be true. There&#x27;s a Dilbert cartoon (<a href=""http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2012-11-06/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2012-11-06/</a>) where the Ugly Truth is that there&#x27;s nothing Microsoft can do to stop its decline into irrelevance and that producing a tablet is their attempt to hide that truth from themselves.<p>And maybe Microsoft&#x27;s internal culture makes it hard for underlings to tell their bosses bad news, so any bad news gets a layer of amelioration and obfuscation for every layer of management.<p>Put all that together and its easy to see how a big failure could happen.",1375240429
6131699,comment,6129148,6131335,1,0,eru,,,"> Most good programming languages have the same flavor -- they are built around a single data structure. In C, this is the pointer + offset (structs, arrays). In Python/Lua it&#x27;s the dictionary. In R it&#x27;s the data frame; in Matlab it&#x27;s the matrix. In Lisp/Scheme it&#x27;s the list.<p>Lists are not very important for Lisp, apart from writing macros.<p>> Java and C++ tend to have exploding codebase size because of the proliferation of types, which cause the M * N explosion. Rich Hickey has some good things to say about this.<p>Haskell has even more types, and no exloding codebases.  The `M * N explosion&#x27; is handled differently there.<p>> For the source code example, how would you write a language-independent grep if every language had its own representation? How about diff? hg or git? merge tools? A tool to jump to source location from compiler output? It takes multiple languages to solve any non-trivial problem, so you will end up with an M x N combinatorial explosion (N tools for each of M languages), whereas you want M + N (M languages + N tools that operate on ALL languages).<p>You&#x27;d use plugins and common interfaces.  (I&#x27;m all in favour of text, but the alternative is still possible, if hard.)",1375240415

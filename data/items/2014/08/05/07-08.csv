8135959,comment,8135517,8135517,3,0,un_publishable,,,"> The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today unveiled … a Web portal that will link to full-text papers a year after they&#x27;re published.\n> Open-access advocates such as University of California, Berkeley, biologist Michael Eisen slammed CHORUS when publishers announced the program it last year. They prefer a full-text government archive like PubMed Central so it is possible to &quot;text mine,&quot; or search across the entire body of papers. “Under this [DOE] plan, the public&#x27;s ability to download, text/data mine, and digitally analyze these articles is severely limited,” SPARC’s Joseph agrees.\n> But Frederick Dylla … says there is little demand for text mining. He says AIP has never gotten a request for its more than 1 million articles; Elsevier, the publishing giant, gets only about six requests a year, he says. Text mining journal articles is “a field that&#x27;s just beginning,&quot; he says.<p>12 months is a joke in the timescale of scientific research, most papers already went through up to a year of prep time before publishing. I would like to see a plan that isn&#x27;t just paying lip service to the ideals of open-access. And Eisen is right about data mining, most journals are terrible in that regard. Even the wonderful arXiv.org doesn&#x27;t provide citation/reference metadata in their API and they are a groundbreaking leader of the movement. I had to write a scraper to map out an arXiv citation network and there are only a few subfields with enough info to do that. Maybe scientists would make more requests if the APIs were better and the citation information wasn’t copyrighted or obfuscated.",1407225408
8135958,comment,8134079,8135916,2,0,twic,,,"But Ansible doesn&#x27;t have masters! It has a machine where you run Ansible. But that can be any machine, as long as it has Ansible installed, the Ansible code checked out, and an authorised SSH key. If your usual machine goes down, just check out the code and run from a different machine. The idea that you need to use local playbooks to use Ansible masterlessly just seems mistaken to me.<p>Moreover, any scheme which involves running local configuration (whether in Ansible, Chef, or Puppet) involves either pushing configuration updates to machines, or having the machines poll for configuration updates, in which case it&#x27;s no different to running remote configuration or having a master, respectively.<p>I don&#x27;t get the point about open ports.

Uber&#x27;s original innovation was -- and this is only remarkable in sf -- they where a taxi <i>that came</i>.<p>I was on crutches for 9 months and took cabs daily to work from near mission and 23rd.  All these cab companies are utter assholes: I booked cabs 3-5 days a week, from a population hub, and tipped well, but none of them could provide decent service.  Each one would say &quot;10-15 minutes&quot; when I would ask how long the cab would take to arrive.  I collected stats for a couple months: the median time was over 30 minutes and the 90th percentile was 1.5 hours.  I even had a cabbie come more than 50 minutes after promised; I&#x27;d already begged a friend to drive me to work.  Dude had the big old brass balls to call my cell and bitch that I hadn&#x27;t cancelled, <i>after</i> I&#x27;d waited over three times their maximum arrival estimate.  One dispatcher even admitted on the phone that they just tell everyone near where I live 10-15 minutes.<p>Uber in other cities may have a harder row to hoe, but in sf, merely being a cab that comes (or -- and this is amazing -- treating your customers with a tiny bit of respect and <i>telling them</i> you won&#x27;t come if you can&#x27;t) gets you really far.<p>Fuck sf taxes -- yellow, desoto, luxor -- I hope all those assholes get unemployed.  I&#x27;m not sure Uber is a good thing in a city with working transport systems, but that doesn&#x27;t describe sf.  They made my life even harder than it already was; there&#x27;s no good reason I should have had to call cabs more than an hour and a half before I wanted to be to work (an 18 minute drive) just to have a greater than 90% chance of making it.  And when you have doctors appointments or surgeries or something else with a hard start time, I have no idea what you&#x27;re supposed to do in sf besides use Uber.

And it is true, particularly for complex queries ORMs can be pretty hideous. If a query goes beyond a certain level of complexity I would much rather replace them with a series of views or stored procedures. ORMs are not good for complex queries.<p>For me, where ORMs do shine is with their output. If you have two tables, A and B with one to many relationships between them - with pure SQL running a join on these tables will return a single result set. Table As data will be duplicated for each row of B. With an ORM you can get back a single object A containing a collection of B&#x27;s rows.<p>This is enough reason for me to reach for an ORM for anything but the simplest of problems.<p>Lazy loading generally also comes for free.",1407224587

Seasteads will require enormous amounts of hard, barely rewarding work to be even marginally functional at first.<p>2. Much of that work will be farming, and much of the rest will be weather-related; preparing the vessel to deal with storms and dealing with the damage wrought by weather.<p>3. Speaking of weather, the volume and intensity of open ocean storms has been increasing for the past three decades and will continue doing so for the forseeable future.<p>4. Ocean aquaculture can be quite a difficult proposition, particularly if you&#x27;re in an area that lacks an existing nutrient cycle.<p>5. Political autonomy doesn&#x27;t work the way people think it does. Sure you can give yourself some breathing room, maybe a new set of building codes; some structures that will let you run business a bit more freely; and those tend to be beneficial. But what about human rights? What if a group wants to experiment with allowing human slavery? Or post natal birth-control where only worthy warriors are allowed to become people? You can generate a whole menagerie of horror stories, but for the most part the upshot is &quot;Autonomy within limits.&quot;  And then you have to have an open debate about what the limits are. Or not, maybe the seasteasds will be a giant set of floating Dubai&#x27;s without Islamic temperance to limit the abuses. Either way seasteads are likely to be fragile enough in the first few years that cohesive social structures will be a requirement for survival. Which argues against the Spencerian libertarianism that seems to be the default position of many interested in the topic. I rather suspect that successful seasteads will have social structures that look more like Kibbutzim than libertarian autonomies.",1407223307

It is far too easy to build portable docker machines and deploy them on bare metal. For me, the use case of provisioning a softlayer server and then setting it up using Ansible/Chef is no longer present.<p>However, the problem of orchestrating <i>a bunch</i> of Docker machines is still unsolved.

I really have no way today. Notice, that the complexity includes setting up bind-volume mapping, logging, passing of variables from one Docker VM to another, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if Chef is more suited to this, given that Octohost moved from Ansible to chef for a Docker PAAS [2], but I would definitely love for Ansible to do this part really well !<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8075705"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8075705</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8086092"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8086092</a>",1407222625

You could pick some flexibility constraints that define a conservative model of how human limbs can bend and swivel, and then design the hardware with physical interlocks that prevent it from moving beyond those limits. Picture an elbow joint that has a metal flange situated such that if the motor tried to extend the arm beyond the normal human straight elbow angle it would be mechanically blocked.<p>The thing that I find more worrisome is the fact that little squishy people will be handling things that are so heavy that, if fumbled, would carry enough momentum to rip right through them. Imagine letting a 250 kg piece of metal slip -- if it hit your flesh, that&#x27;s a problem.

Do clients have to explicitly leave the channel?<p>My team was estimating a story recently which could have used this, but we didn&#x27;t want to spend the time and effort to build a whole infrastructure for one message.

That means I get to act as coach/mentor for about 35 web and mobile app projects per year (for real clients ranging from startups to multinationals), am very plugged in to the IT and startup scenes in the area, and I get to learn through students&#x27; experience about all the development subjects I&#x27;m interested in.  I assign students to give &quot;tech talks&quot; on the things they&#x27;re discovering, and I can invite all kinds of experts to come give guest lectures to my classes, which they are often happy to do.  On top of all that, publishers practically throw tech books at me if I even hint that I might use assign of their titles as a textbook.  And I get to wear a bow tie to work with no one second-guessing me.  <i>At least not out loud...</i><p>Getting the job meant hard work, prayer, and mental toughness to get through the hazing process of a 5-year PhD and 1-year postdoc earning next to nothing.

The peak of the distribution today (the consensus) is actually only about 502,000 routes, but recognizably valid answers can range from 497,000 to 511,000, and a few have straggled across the 512,000 line already.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes/</a><p>It&#x27;s interesting how they explain that since there&#x27;s no true consensus for the actual size of the routing table, the &quot;event&quot; of crossing the 512k barrier has frankly already begun ... and, so far, hasn&#x27;t been catastrophic, nor likely to be.",1407992683

Generally it might be way less efficent? What would the OS look like? It seems like a lot of OS services would disappear? You&#x27;d have a cloud of processes.

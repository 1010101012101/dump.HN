That way you can load the stock data onto the client side and do the processing there (presumably you're already doing this for your graphs anyway) - kick it off with a few generations of pretty loose genetic algorithm then when you get near your time limit switch to simulated annealing with the best handful of results to narrow down the answer as fast as possible. Keep it quick, say 2 seconds tops. Then what you can do is give the client a confidence rating so you can say something like ""Found the following result with 89% confidence. Click here to perform a longer search for higher accuracy"". Work out your confidence rating based on how bumpy the ride was.",1348231992

I think people have the nitpicking over the title covered.<p>I for one am very happy to see Apple get this award. The D&AD is a big deal. I'm a designer who has been part of teams that have won awards in the past and I don't really put much stock in them. But the D&AD is different. We're talking about an awards body who in the past have not given out an award in some categories because there was nothing award worthy. Imagine the Oscars saying <i>there'll be no best director award this year because they've all been crap</i>. For that reason (and many other) it has credibility. It has prestige. As far as acknowledgement goes, it's hard to best a yellow or black pencil.<p>And then we have Apple. Im hard pressed to think of another company from the past 50 years who has invested so much of itself into design, or owes so much to the quality of it's designers. There will always be those who claim Apple ripped off Dieter Rams, but I think Dieter himself has extinguished that argument many times over.<p>During Apple's recovery from near death over the past 15 years, the thing that's stood out for me is the effect their design philosophy has had on the rest of the world. As a designer, it's hard to get people to acknowledge the value of good design and people look at you like you're a pre-madonna when you complain about kerning or ""how something just feels wrong"". But now there's Apple, the most valuable company in the world, a seeming unstoppable titan we designers can point to a say <i>look! You might not care about line heights, but they do and they're the biggest company in the world</i>.<p>We still get looked at like we're idiots, but not so much now. And I think Apple has had a big part to play in that.",1348231760

I think that works, although the fact that one needs a metaframework is... interesting.<p>Eclipse? I love eclipse. I used emacs every day for 2 years, IRC in emacs, news in emacs, EVERYTHING in emacs. Eventually I got sick of IMAP blocking and interrupting the world. I grew to love Eclipse because I realised I could not efficiently comprehend Java code any more without it.<p>Over-layering is a serious, serious problem in Java. I think I understand your point of view, but a big part of my job is performing code reviews. It really sh%ts me every time to have to jump through the Service, the ServiceImpl, then the Repository, the RepositoryImpl, the Dao, the DaoImpl and... oh, there's the fricking query. Thanks guys.<p>My huge problem in Java is that I always find 8 classes where 2 would do. The extra classes do serve a purpose; they fulfil stereotyped, expected roles. In some ways the boilerplace reduces cognitive overhead. In other ways, it really does not.<p>Personally as someone who reviews multi-million line codebases regularly for a living, I am actually terrified of hordes of new Java developers discovering lambdas or acquiring advanced generics. These things are tactical nuclear weapons of source code obfuscation in the hands of people whose judgement (through bitter experience) I no longer really trust.<p>Spring is not evil, but it does make life difficult because it's hard to follow references. Fortunately, whenever you see an interface Foo you normally just have to jump to FooImpl. Because it turns out that 90% of interfaces are actually not needed; except culturally, stylistically or dogmatically. Personally I think they're over-used, but that's because my observation is that most interfaces (seriously, 90% level) are implemented only once.<p>Agree on the checked exceptions though. That was a mistake.<p>I think actually there is nothing wrong with Java as a language, but without sane leadership the corporate culture of it becomes uniquely byzantine.",1348231256

In my case, the ""IDE"" is vim running in a terminal window, with another terminal window to the right where I run git, grep, and tests.  Nevertheless, even in this austere environment I could imagine a vim plugin which would let me wrap some sort of bracketed enclosures around piece of text, possibly nested, with the ability to expand and contract with the press of single key.  Without even searching, I'll estimate the probability of that already existing as 85%.<p>Problem is, anyone viewing the code in a normal text display, e.g. on github or plain text editor, would see all the excruciating detail, all the time.  But it's an interesting idea.<p>Perhaps instead of the expand/collapse, I could just use links.  Vim users should note that when you're sitting on a word, if you type ""gf"" it will Go to that File (i.e. open it up right there), and you can use ""o"" and ""i"" the way you use ""Back"" and ""Forward"" in a browser.",1348230751

The NDA and the $99 fee are bigger obstacles to wider uninvited beta adoption, I'd assume, but intentional. This may or may not be a good thing: more testers isn't always better for bug report quality, and for a hardware company like Apple, it'd be bad business to encourage widespread adoption of beta firmware, without either support for devices running beta software (unlikely), nor support for uninstalling beta software. It's probably not even legal in all jurisdictions.",1348229184

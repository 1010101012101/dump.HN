Yes, a lot of bloggers do write whatever they feel and it just comes out real easy, but a lot of bloggers (such as myself) would love to have some sort of resource to find out what readers want to hear.<p>Skribit is a great idea. I think it's still very young and has a lot of room to grow, but it's a terrific start and the first of its kind.",1214210719
224928,comment,224861,224861,0,0,swombat,,,"<i>The problem begins when students are encouraged to forget this truth, when academic excellence becomes excellence in some absolute sense, when “better at X” becomes simply “better.”</i><p>Interesting... I found the opposite. I went to Oxford University (as elite as it gets), with a head big as a balloon, and clearly thinking myself better than everyone. Four years in the presence of people whose intellect crushed me like an insignificant cockroach taught me humility. Since I still needed to believe that I wasn't... you know... just plainly inferior, that forced me to re-rationalise what it means to be ""better"", and to come to the conclusion that intellectual prowess has nothing to do with being a better person.<p><i>It forgot that the true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers.</i><p>I also disagree with this, to an extent. My time in Oxford made me a more rounded person, intellectually, inter-personally, and emotionally. And I think that was the right result - that's certainly what my parents hoped when I went in. I think the purpose of education is to make people - not just minds or careers. A person is a combination of many different things, including mind, network of connections, desires, abilities, and a myriad other things.<p>Mind you, Oxford might just be different from Yale... perhaps Yale should take a leaf ;-)",1214210703
224927,comment,224861,224861,0,0,smanek,,,"That was surprisingly good.<p>Although, I think it paints with too fine a brush sometimes (narrowing its conclusions to the Ivy Leagues).<p>For example, I've definitely noticed a loss of solitude and way too much over specialization too early. A lot of the people I know in Ivy League schools began competing and winning in contests in their chosen field by middle school. I understand that a University would rather admit a USAMO or Intel Science Fair Winner - but the competition there is so intense it forces students aiming high to begin specializing before they're even teenagers.<p>Frankly I've taken more math courses than anyone ever should, and there are still some USAMO problems that I couldn't solve given unlimited time. Take a look: <a href=""http://www.unl.edu/amc/a-activities/a7-problems/USAMO-IMO/q-usamo/-pdf/usamo2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unl.edu/amc/a-activities/a7-problems/USAMO-IMO/q-...</a> And they expect 16 year olds to do that!<p>Hell, I've personally seen a few high school science fair projects that are essentially graduate level work involving genetic engineering and monte carlo simulations.<p>Although, to be fair, a lot of these kids also try to see the bigger picture and recognize the role of their formal education (they are usually the ones who end up as quants or traders ;-)).",1214210541

There's a lot of unfortunate bellyaching about random 'mistakes' the Coca-Cola company made that clearly would not have been worth thinking about on the first pitch of the company (like worrying about letting other products use the word ""cola"").<p>By the end you realize it's less of an instructional on how to build a good soft drink business and more of a rant about how there aren't any good sociologists/psychologists working at a Coca-Cola and that the academics aren't paying enough attention.<p>Not really that useful...",1214210019
224921,comment,224520,224520,0,0,saundby,,,"Start doing some part-time businesses now. Get with classmates, especially classmates outside your major, put together something quick and dirty and see if you can make a few bucks. You'll learn what you need to complement your skills & personality and get some experience balancing different parts of your life, going through the whole business start-deliver-grow-falter-fail cycle. Invaluable experience and killer resume/interview material.<p>For social groups, find groups _outside_ of college. You'll be able to connect with people at all stages of life, and you won't be an outsider the day you graduate. Find something with a worldwide presence, whether it's the group or just the activity itself. I did medieval re-enactment, I connected with not only other medievalists worldwide, but all historical enthusiasts. Travel? Free room and board and often transport from the more established co-enthusiasts. Instant networking, too--jobs, advice, backing, prospects, you name it.",1214209822

Is it because someone just introduced a bunch of vulnerabilities into the MRI?  Is it because someone just fixed a bunch of potential security flaws?  that's what it looks like in the code, but then I don't get it, what's so bad about fixing bugs???
I think he's trying to say that there is some secret juju going on, where special people get to find this stuff out before others, but Zed never actually gets around to explain why he feels that this is the case - it is after all open source, and everyone has access to it.<p>Or maybe he feels that the fact that there was a delay of a couple of days between the patches going live, and the actual announcement.  Oh noes!  It's the end of the world!  Quick, sue somebody!<p>Anyway, I've wasted too much time on this post as it is.  Zed Shaw may actually be a brilliant programmer, but considering his complete inability to be more coherent than a Markhov chain generator, I'll never know it.",1214209616

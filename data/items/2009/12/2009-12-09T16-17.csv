However, I suspect that the failure rate among those that take a completely divergent approach is pretty high.<p>Maybe you don't have to match the competition feature-for-feature, but you do need to match them need-for-need.  If you don't address customer needs, good luck with your conversion rate.  And in the end, a feature matrix is just one company's articulation of what it thinks those customer needs are.  Maybe you disagree or maybe you have a better way, but if the same 70% of features show up over and over again amongst your competition, you'd better find a way to satisfy those needs.<p>In the interest of not posting a tome, I've elaborated on my blog (see profile for link).",1260375107

I pay an ISP and the ISP gives me physical access to their network so I can access the internet. Google is not an ISP by this definition.

7752504,comment,7746585,7752398,1,0,stormbrew,,,"I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re actually arguing with any points I&#x27;m making. I agree with everything in your second paragraph.<p>But you started this conversation talking about the data facebook holds that locks you in. Relationship data is trivially rebuildable (and often benefits from periodic culling anyways), so that leaves the more concrete data like pictures and posts. Those are important, but most people seem to treat them pretty much as ephemeral in practice.<p>So at this point I don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re arguing or why you&#x27;re arguing with me. Yes, the people are the important thing in a social network. Where they go you go. If your friends all go somewhere else, you will follow them. Where this differs from films or television is that, unlike films and televisions, your friends can two-time another network that offers a different value proposition until the network effects catch up. I&#x27;ve seen this happen personally, and that was my original point.<p>And just to clarify on this:<p>> ou say the original provider was &quot;dominant demographically and regionally&quot;, but that basically translates to &quot;not as dominant as Facebook&quot;<p>When I talk about facebook coming on to the open market, I mean literally in the 6 months or so after people who didn&#x27;t go to an accredited university could use it. At the beginning of that we were, within that region, absolutely more dominant than facebook (obviously). We were much more dominant than myspace (less obvious, and we were very proud of it) even. We were the #1 social network in that region hands down.<p>At the end of that 6 month period the network effect had completely shifted to them and people were visiting our site once a month who previously visited several times a day. When we changed things up, they just stopped coming rather than bother learning how to use the new stuff.",1400191155

Instead, it needs only to notice that the body in the mirror looks and moves the same as its own body, and then make the connection that if there’s a spot on the body in the mirror, there could also be a spot on its own body.&quot;</i><p>So the question of &quot;Does the chimp see a reflection as another chimp or a chimp on this side of the mirror?&quot; is the fundamental question. A two chimp experiment might resolve that question, which is can the Chimp distinguish between a visual of a chimp and the actual chimp when both are present.",1400191040

7752476,comment,7751110,7751988,7,0,bostik,,,"> <i>tldr: At the end of the day, if you want to consume mainstream media, you&#x27;ve got to put up with the mainstream consumption hardware/software.</i><p>I don&#x27;t put up with it, and hence have chosen to avoid devices which would impose DRM on me.<p>I&#x27;m a voracious reader. Several of my friends have asked why I don&#x27;t have a kindle, and the answer is simple. Kindle may be the best reader <i>right now</i>, but unless I can freely move any books bought for it to another device down the road, I will <i>REFUSE</i> to pay the prices of e-books.<p>If I can not move it the same way I can move a physical book, I haven&#x27;t bought it. Therefore, I will not pay even close to the amount of a paperback copy. Something like 30-40% of the physical copy price, at most, would be the correct range. And since I don&#x27;t own it, I should expect to pay for it about the same amount I would get for it when taking it to a used book shop.<p>So, in reality the correct DRM&#x27;d e-book price for me would be something like 10-15% of the physical book&#x27;s price. Anything more and I simply won&#x27;t bother unless the book is supposedly really good. All in all, I&#x27;ll rather leave the book unread for now and eventually get it for ~25% of the price second-hand.<p>That&#x27;s a market the publishers don&#x27;t make a penny on. Their loss.",1400190817

7752474,comment,7751593,7751952,11,0,ecdavis,,,"My cat ignores mirrors. He also ignores screens and isn&#x27;t bothered by audio of dogs or cats. At the same time, he&#x27;s very alert and will generally spring to attention if he hears a dog or cat outside. A few years ago he was introduced to another cat, separated by glass, and his reaction was completely different compared to looking at a mirror. I don&#x27;t remember the first time he saw a mirror.<p>I think that cats have a pretty decent idea of what is and isn&#x27;t real. While a reflection may be interesting in that it looks like another cat, it lacks the accompanying sound and smell of an intruder and is therefore safe to ignore.<p>On a related note, many years ago my family lived in a house with a lot of bird life in the back yard. There was a family of magpies, a number of chickens and a solitary male guineafowl. While moving in we leaned an old mirror against a fence in the yard and it ended up staying there for years.<p>Initially, the magpies attempted to fight their reflections but they quickly learned that there was no point. After that they ignored the mirror. The chickens never seemed to notice it in the first place. The guineafowl, though, was most interesting. This is a species that forms flocks in the wild. This particular guineafowl, though, had been separated from its flock for years and was completely alone. To begin with it had the same reaction as the magpies and attempted to fight itself in the mirror. Over time, however, this behavior stopped. Instead of fighting, it would simply stand in front of the mirror for hours on end.",1400190812

Django&#x27;s DB abstractions keep you from having to really worry about what actual database you&#x27;re running on; unless you had hard-coded dialect-specific SQL somewhere, you just flip a couple settings and now you&#x27;re talking to the other database.<p>Same for changing replication setups, for changing authentication mechanisms, for changing logging setup, for changing how you do caching... all of these are things that can and in the real world do change, either from testing to production environments or over the life of a production application.<p>So it makes sense to abstract those, and the abstraction is backed by &quot;these are things people have really needed to do frequently&quot;.<p>What I have a problem with, and what I criticize as overabstraction, is when someone then comes along and says &quot;well, what if you replace the persistence layer with something that&#x27;s not even persistent, like volatile memory or stdout (which is actually logging, not persistence, at that point -- a confusion of concerns!)&quot; And then they write a blog post explaining how <i>really</i> you should keep abstracting to the point that the code <i>can</i> &quot;persist&quot; data to those things.<p>And that&#x27;s why I say that the examples almost always feel incredibly contrived; it&#x27;s like somebody didn&#x27;t know when to stop, and just kept abstracting everything they could find until they ended up with an overengineered mess. Static/dynamic actually has very little to do with this, since even languages that do static typing in overly-verbose and un-useful ways can handle the kinds of abstractions people actually use.<p>So I don&#x27;t see a point in re-architecting for these weird contrived hypotheticals, which always seem to be the focus of whatever we&#x27;re calling the indirect-abstraction-for-everything pattern nowadays; it produces code that&#x27;s more complex than necessary, has more layers of indirection (and hence bugs) than necessary, and doesn&#x27;t actually gain any utility in the process.",1400190257

Every cent you spend for Hollywood&#x27;s products is used to sponsor DRM, and things like the DMCA on a political level, so make sure they don&#x27;t get a single cent from you.<p>While this may sound like a David-against-Goliath effort, keep in mind that pirating content has an intrinsic value proposition (maximum usability, zero cost, no censorship) which can never be exceeded by DRM offerings. So it isn&#x27;t difficult to convince anyone to pirate instead of buying, you just have to show them how ;)<p>What we must get rid of is the (content-industry sponsored) notion that piracy is somehow immoral. It isn&#x27;t. Trying to take away the rights of users just because they don&#x27;t go along well with a specific business model is.<p>(note: of course all this only applies to DRM content, and companies advocating it. Non-DRM offerings like gog.com, independent artists etc. are fine and should be paid for if used).",1400188919
7752324,comment,7750935,7750935,3,0,simczak,,,"From a interview with Lama Lodru Rinpoche about the challenge of three year silent retreat:<p>&quot;The physical obstacles are not so difficult for people. After one week people have no problem with fewer hours of sleep. After several weeks the pain of sitting cross legged is overcome. The physical obstacles are not the problem; physical problems we can control. Mental problems are more difficult to control. It is very difficult to discipline the mind. No matter how much discipline you have, when a thought comes you have no power to stop it, unless you can employ very powerful effective techniques to cut off those thoughts.<p>Q: Are these techniques only available to people on 3-year retreat?\nLLR: People outside 3-year retreat have no time to employ these techniques. First of all you have to tame your mind, make your mind soft and gentle, and then you can utilize more active techniques. Without this taming of the mind the techniques are not useful, and could even bring lots of difficulties. It is not so much that people outside 3-year retreat cannot learn or be given these techniques it is just they have no time to apply them. They have to make a living, there are lots of distractions, and this type of distracted mind is not good for the pr ofound teachings you learn in 3-year retreat. Also during 3-year retreat the teachings are given in sequence, not all at once. When one teaching is complete another is introduced.&quot;",1400188918

On the other hand, it may be correct (as is apparently the judgment of most participants here) that the article just isn&#x27;t that informative. See an important article from <i>The Atlantic,</i> &quot;Confusing Math Homework? Don’t Blame the Common Core: States, districts, and schools are actually in charge&quot;[1] for more on what&#x27;s really going in classrooms around the country.<p>Some of the comments here refer to a period of &quot;reform math&quot; instruction BEFORE the introduction of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics,[2] which are actually quite recent. Implementation of the Common Core in school classrooms in the United States is only a year or two old today. The Common Core was an attempt to introduce coherency and logical progression into the mishmash of topics that characterized &quot;reform math&quot; textbooks such as <i>Everyday Math</i> (which is probably the best and most mathematically sound of the reform math textbooks) and <i>TERC: Investigations,</i> among other titles. The Common Core standards are generally regarded, as curriculum standards, as a plain improvement over what most states set as mathematics curriculum standards before.[3] On the other hand, many of the mathematics who criticized the preceding period of &quot;reform math&quot; instruction (basically most United States school practice in the twenty-first century) think that the current Common Core textbooks and teacher training courses still don&#x27;t go far enough in improving instruction.<p>As a parent, I expect and welcome school instruction in any topic that is better and more research-based than what I received as a child. The quotations from parents in the article kindly submitted here along the lines of &quot;Why should my child be expected to learn things I don&#x27;t understand?&quot; seems like a very bizarre approach to parenting to me. (As a homeschooling parent, I used the Miquon Math[4] and Singapore Primary Mathematics series[5] with great success in helping my four children learn their elementary mathematics. They have been able to go on to more advanced mathematics study with relative ease. I had to learn new topics and new techniques to use those materials, but that is good for me. I was lucky that my wife, educated in Taiwan, largely understands the approach taken in the Singapore materials, but so far both of our older two sons have gone well beyond the mathematics study level of either of their parents. Education is supposed to improve from generation to generation, or what are schools for? (That&#x27;s why we homeschool--we lay a good foundation for our children with the best available curricular materials to get them ready for classes with teachers who know what they are doing for our children&#x27;s secondary education.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/04/confusing-math-homework-don-t-blame-the-common-core/360064/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/04/confusi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/Math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corestandards.org/Math/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://educationnext.org/the-common-core-math-standards/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/the-common-core-math-standards/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://miquonmath.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://miquonmath.com/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39....</a>",1400188854

7752275,comment,7751290,7752052,5,0,pmahoney,,,"I think if you consider the outliers on the &quot;talent&quot; scale, such as Jim Ryun, Sebastian Coe, current record holder Hicham El Guerrouj (3:43.13) compared to the entirety of humanity over the past few centuries, you&#x27;ve got to assume there have been other outliers of equal or greater &quot;talent&quot;.<p>So the question is, how fast can an outlier in talent run with minimal or suboptimal training? Or what kind of training can one get &quot;by accident&quot;?<p>Jim Ryun [1] (along with a handful of others) ran under 4 minutes as a high-school student (a junior in Ryun&#x27;s case). He didn&#x27;t exactly fall out of bed and do that, but neither was he a professional having many years of training leading up to the achievement. Ryun&#x27;s training was probably not optimal. Running enthusiasts often complain that his coach was a former swim coach who did not use training routines commonly recommended today.<p>Many sports played on foot involve lots of aerobic running combined with occasional sprinting.  Also consider Cliff Young [2] who claimed to have &quot;run for two to three days straight rounding up sheep&quot;, presumably as a routine-ish part of his job. He went on to win an 875km ultra marathon.<p>It&#x27;s all speculation of course, but given all that and the fact that modern mile record is quite a bit faster than 4 minutes, I think it&#x27;s plausible that a highly talented individual got enough training from work, sports, or perhaps even dedicated training to run a 4 minute mile.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ryun"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ryun</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Young_%28athlete%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Young_%28athlete%29</a>",1400188297

It&#x27;s a small barrier for manipulation, but a barrier nonetheless. That, alone, should reduce vote manipulation significantly.<p>valME also has a cost for downvoting. When you downvote on valME, it costs you 2 karma (and your downvote removes 1 karma from the content provider). This should significantly reduce downvote brigades as there&#x27;s now a barrier to downvote.<p>Because moderators (and everyone else) can now see who is voting and in what direction they are voting, users who manipulate voting will be more obvious to everyone. Mods can then change permissions (both for domains and users) or use the modqueue to remove posts. (If mods remove posts and comments, like Upde, there&#x27;s a public trail and a reason required.

There is great content out there on various blogs and, if they don&#x27;t have a donation button, the most I can do to really reward them when I like something is clicking on some random ad so they get the credit. Technologies like this, with the cost of a penny or two, don&#x27;t put up a large barrier for content creators, and it gives them an alternative to advertising. It also gives them the potential for a huge upside when people really value their content.<p>The market here isn&#x27;t for content providers of memes or 140-character comments. It&#x27;s for higher quality content providers. I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re scared of the idea to find alternatives for rewarding people who give us value.",1400187774

Copyright is a bargain between the <i>demos</i> and the creators of artistic works. In that bargain the creators get protection from the state for their monopolistic exploitation of a work <i>on the proviso</i> that the work then enters the public domain after a &quot;limited&quot; time.<p>Now distribution companies and purchasers of copyrights and employers of copyright creators have managed to erode the limitation of that period to a great extent but the limitation still holds. Ergo, works must enter the Public Domain when the term expires.<p>Works with DRM can not [properly] do this. Not in any way as might analogise that imagined by those creating copyright laws initially. The work must be free to be used in any way the public sees fit (except perhaps those that contravene moral rights, I&#x27;d personally extend some moral rights in perpetuity - eg right to be acknowledged as creator of a work).<p>Copyright law should punish those that forcibly rest fair use (or fair dealing as we get in the UK) from the public and no protection should be offered by the state for works that can&#x27;t be guaranteed to enter the public domain (eg by deposition of non-DRM in an archive to which the rights holder that chooses DRM pays a fee for maintenance).<p>Copyright law is a deal that has been broken. Too much power has been ceded by politicians to the media conglomerates on the public&#x27;s behalf and without proper warrant.",1400187617

But building small pieces of code that have little knowledge of their surroundings, and testing them independently, is no panacea.<p>You can see this problem in any Java Enterprise shop that has code coverage as a religion: To make it possible to cover all that code (including all the boilerplate caused by the technologies selected), then we end up with a billion little classes that are managed by some kind of dependency injection system. Hundreds of thousands of lines of Spring XML configuration files, or their equivalent in annotations. Every piece is tested, but are all the pieces tested together, automatically? We quickly get into extremely large and expensive automation suites, or a whole lot of things that aren&#x27;t really tested regularly, making all those unit tests a lot less valuable.<p>We can&#x27;t wish complexity away: Make every unit too small, and the management of the units is now your new problem. You head in the same direction with the whole Microservices context.<p>A maintainable system is one built of components that are just simple and cohesive enough to be understandable by a human, but not any simpler. The right modularization is the hardest thing we do in software. The right size is hard to gauge, modules like that might be hard to name, and they are often hard to test. Sometimes one of those aspects must suffer for the others to do well.",1400187604

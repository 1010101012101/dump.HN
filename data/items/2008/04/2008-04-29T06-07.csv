If it were someone else, I would have listed their positive qualities.

176382,comment,176251,176290,0,0,elai,,,"I personally found it more intuitive than the windows method.  You don't know how many people you hear about screwing up windows some way because they just thought deleting the folder in program files would be enough.  Or thinking that the shortcut is the program and deleting it would uninstall it.  All those explanatory message boxes that come up in windows comes from common mistakes and misconceptions that show up in user usability testing.<p>Mac: The application is a file.  To get rid of it, just delete it like a file.
Windows: You have to run a program to install it, and run a program to uninstall it. Do it any other way and<p>The mac paradigm is a bit leaky although, with .pkg files and what not.  The .dmg distribution method is a bit annoying, but it allows developers to add fancy graphics when people install their programs.",1209452018

Life on the micro-level is fun because the speed of light is relatively huge.<p>They became faster. Foreseeing the heat depth of the universe, they invented a way to squeeze an eternity of subjective time into a second of real time, and stayed there. Or turned around in time. Or started oscillating back and forth in the same time interval.<p>They invented wish control, eliminated the survival instinct and went extinct.<p>They contacted God and ascended.",1209449719

Different story altogether...the world will not suffer without his creative output, while I suspect it will in the case of Reiser.  Though, we might find that without his cantankerous and obstinate style of addressing the LKML ReiserFS may wind up more widely used.  That assumes that the SuSE folks keep working on it, and the Namesys guys are able to keep the company going under new leadership (this is a problem, as Hans' stubbornness and passion for the idea is the primary reason Namesys has lasted as long as it has, and I doubt anyone else will have that crazy drive to keep it going--the best thing that could happen is probably a buyout by SuSE or IBM or similar).",1209449684

1560444,comment,1560072,1560425,0,0,noname123,,,"> As far as I can tell, this is the only argument presented against HFT.<p>The argument is that HFT provides liquidity <i>precisely when</i> traders don't need it. You need broker/dealer to step in and take the other side of the trade when someone wants to trade and there <i>isn't anyone else</i> willing to trade. The issue with HFT is that, as the predatory example provided above, that HFT is actually buying up your liquidity in the market and selling it back to you at a higher price. Specifically, most HFT prop shops deals in ETB (easy to borrow) stocks such as GOOG, AAPL, & BAC where tens of millions of shares are traded daily. These securities don't need liquidity broker/dealers, as there are already tons of true buyers and sellers out there. Are there any HFT dealers in penny stocks or small caps where some liquidity would be much needed? Nope.<p>> Are there other factors involved in this outcome, or is this a canonical HFT failure?<p>Nope. The reason a lot of dealers stopped trading that day were tactical. A lot of stat-arb prop shops got burned during when Bear collapsed, one black box decided to sell everything which cascaded another black box to sell everything, which cascaded to everyone wanting to dump everything. So from that experience, HFT shops decided to not hold any positions beyond seconds and shut down everything when market crashes seriously. So they provide liquidity when the market is doing well, but when the shit hits the fan, self-interests also hits in and the ""liquidity-providers"" head for the hills.",1280471979

There's no reason he wouldn't decide to go play in the snow.

In fact, he'd be better able to entertain even more complicated fantasies, to even better ponder life's mysteries, and to savor the world around him more fully.<p>I'm not saying that medicine is always the thing for everyone, but this comic implies that medicating children for ADHD is a tragedy. It implies that we'd be left with Calvin alone rather than Calvin and Hobbes. An imagination crushed and a childhood ruined.<p>On the contrary, it would be more likely to become Calvin and Hobbes and Crusoe and Harry Potter and Native Americans and Beethoven and Newton. Because he would be able to read a wider variety of books more easily.<p>And Calvin would finally be able to do math, complete his homework without it taking three times as long as it should, and to think about what he wants to say prior to actually saying it instead of lacking that capability.<p>It doesn't wipe out the interest in or capacity for daydreaming; it prevents daydreaming from running unchecked and unintended over other valuable and interesting things that a kid can do.",1280471762

This is huge for both governments, people trying to build a business and people living in 3rd world like myself (Peru) where people cannot afford to pay billions in licensing. I'm glad our governments is not wasting their money on Microsoft licenses as they are switching to free software.

If you want to talk about how systems interact with the world, you can use bisimilarity relations to prove &quot;these two systems interact with the world in the same way&quot;.<p>You can also use co-inductive types to embed the temporal logic of actions (TLA) in Coq; TLA is the language Leslie Lamport works with for &quot;Specifying Systems&quot;.<p>* <a href=""http://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/RecTutorial.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/RecTutorial.pdf</a><p>* <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Specifying-Systems-Language-Hardware-Engineers/dp/032114306X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Specifying-Systems-Language-Hardware-E...</a><p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisimulation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisimulation</a>",1433779166

This A: suggests that the argument that science is currently in the middle of about &quot;how much standing should one do&quot; is <i>entirely</i> misguided, dealing with a secondary if not tertiary variable instead of the real problems... and there is a <i>LONG</i> history of this in the health field, so it&#x27;s hardly a crazy idea... B: explains why &quot;too much standing&quot; could be a problem... &quot;standing&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;good&quot;, it&#x27;s just that it builds core muscles, and too much of it is independently &quot;bad&quot;, and C: if true would suggest that one could obtain the benefits of standing, and probably <i>more</i>, by directly focusing on building core strength instead of indirectly and more inefficiently building it.<p>I call this a &quot;pet theory&quot; because I believe it to be a reasonable harmonization of several current lines of scientific inquiry, and I don&#x27;t have the evidence to <i>disprove</i> it, but I also lack the evidence to really solidly <i>prove</i> it.<p>One can see how it might also relate to this article.<p>Having had at least my own experience with my own core weakness, it is actually somewhat astonishing to me that my core can become so weak as to be a source of pain even in my mid-30s. It would be natural to assume that the very things causing pain would itself spur the core on to grow stronger, but it seems at least in my experience the core needs &quot;superstimulus&quot; to grow large enough to even competently do its main job. (I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m confused as to why that&#x27;s the case... if one looks at the history of our species and considers the working of natural selection, it&#x27;s not an impossible or nonsensical outcome.

The optimal language is of course the assembly language of the target platform. However it&#x27;s often more practical to use a language that compiles down to a target platform&#x27;s instruction set with the fewest number of transformations (barring the presence of optimizations).<p>Flub languages attempt to give programmers the tools to write programs which hold some provable invariant, provide denotational semantics, or some combination of these. The benefit of this is some reduced cognitive load, expressive power, and other &quot;soft&quot; features. This power is what lets small teams run circles around Blub programmers in the Blub/Flub paradox.<p>However the utility of these features and whether they actually do allow small teams to get more work done in less time hasn&#x27;t been proven to me yet. It may seem tedious to think to think of the statistically significant data-access pattern in a given operation and forming your data-structures and transformations to make that access pattern the fastest route for the target platform... but it has big wins in terms of execution speed of the programs and the maintainability of such programs. One still requires a significant amount of mathematical reasoning and understanding of what a compiler can and cannot do for you.<p>I&#x27;m slowly coming to the opinion that there won&#x27;t ever be a compiler or Flub language that will give you your cake and let you eat it too. In practice I&#x27;ve found re-usability to be a low-priority concern, generics to be a performance hindrance, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a convincing example of how type-safety is the future of mission-critical software (though there are some promising projects for sure).<p>Thus in conclusion: I think Blub languages will continue to rule the roost. Flub will come and go and remain fashionable as the OP has alluded to. However I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the avenue worth pursuing in order to write better programs... too much abstraction makes it rather difficult to reason about what our programs are actually executing on the target platform and for many cases that can be critical. It always comes down to the data and at some-point one needs to consider the target platform anyway. Data-oriented design is one way to think of the data first and allows the programmer to choose the appropriate semantics for the necessary transformations to be expressed by their program.<p>(I hope I&#x27;m making sense).",1433778674

Once the game was closed, the organizers took their 20%, the remainder was the jackpot, and then they published that amount with all player-selected combinations, without any names.  The state lottery acted as the caller.  Every official drawing converted uncalled numbers into called numbers, and when all numbers on someone&#x27;s card had been called, they won.  Any player could check whether they--or anyone else--had won as a result of the most recent drawing.<p>It was assumed that all players knew which of the published combinations was theirs, and they could all talk to each other.  So if they got the unremarkable shopping bag full of $20 bills, and it was not the published jackpot amount, word would get around, and people would stop playing.<p>State lotteries typically allocate 5-10% for game management and promotion and a larger fraction for the state, for a total rake of 33-50%.  Delaware, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and West Virginia all keep more than 50% of the player bets.[0]  Massachusetts actually runs a fairer game than most.<p>So if you want to be a small-time bookie, you now know which five states are the most profitable to operate in--along with the six states with no lotteries that are not casino-laden Nevada: Alabama, Mississippi, Utah, Alaska, Hawaii, and Wyoming.<p>[0] <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/what-percentage-of-state-lottery-money-goes-to-the-state/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/what-percentage-of-state-...</a>",1433778079

No offense to you OP, but if I took a job somewhere and saw that they were doing this, I would cut my losses and leave immediately.<p>While it sounds quite nice in theory to slim down your configuration to only have runtime configuration for variables that you see yourself changing, what I imagine ends up happening in practice is that you&#x27;re left in a situation where you&#x27;re doing far more work and only superficially benefitting by having an config that appears short and simple, but is in reality a complex system with nooks and crannies.<p>Here are some problems that I see with this:<p>* You&#x27;re now on the hook for maintaining this software. Security problem? Your problem. Update? Your date, canceled, because an upgrade to the program changed everything. The version distributed by your distro had a nice post-installation hook for the new layout, but you have no such benefit. Your distribution might even have a few distro-specific patches for the software. Is tracking the upstream version, tracking your distros patches, and compiling the software actually saving you effort?<p>* Potentially undefined behavior. A configuration option can be in undefined and taking a default value, defined at compile time, or defined at runtime. Are you intimate enough with this code to know what&#x27;s going to happen when you define it in multiple places? Maybe you add something to your runtime options, only to find out a week later that the change never happened because it was already set at compile time and that takes preference. Maybe the program has a runtime exception and crashes 3 days later at 3:00AM because it doesn&#x27;t know what to do when it finds it in multiple places.<p>* Who the hell is looking at their configuration options enough that this actually crosses their mind? I&#x27;ve configured exim4, so I know exactly the situation you&#x27;re describing with regard to a configuration that is just downright ugly. But I don&#x27;t have a visceral reaction because I know that once I&#x27;ve configured this, I&#x27;m done. Maybe a few months later I change an option.<p>Mixing compile time and runtime configuration means you not only lose the advantages of both, but you gain their disadvantages as well.",1433778052

Governments, however, must often make such decisions.<p>Therefore, if you are an HNU [Human Neurological Uniformity] denialist and someone asks you whether you’re a <i>racist</i>, you can ask him if he implies the above belief, which we can call <i>racial essentialism</i>.

If he says no, you can tell him yes.<p>One also must be quite a bit more careful than Hume [quoted previously] with the words <i>superior</i> and <i>inferior</i>. This implies some quantitative ordering of overall personal worth, an idea one would expect Hume to be the last to accept. For example, consider the proposition that Jews tend to be better chess players than Negroes, whereas Negroes tend to be better dancers than Jews. Both halves of this statement may (or may not) be true, but neither can justify us in ranking the two races overall—unless our sole criterion of personal worth is either chess or dance.

Scala and OCaml and Haskell all get varying degrees of industry use, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to C++, Java, Python, etc. So it&#x27;s clear that we haven&#x27;t even almost gotten to the point where the industry uses proper types at large.<p>I guess my point is this: Why then do you think at a certain point they start hurting?

As /System is already owned by root, <i>write errors</i> at /System means elevating to root won&#x27;t be enough.<p>B) Assuming &quot;rootless&quot; is in fact a superset of what I mentioned in A, and going by the rumored name, they could be restricting what the &#x27;root&#x27; user can do by default on OS X, matching some configurations of Linux where simply gaining root access doesn&#x27;t automatically gain you <i>total</i> access. In other words, root can do things like load signed kexts, install system-wide software, etc, but not overwrite critical system files or perform various other sensitive actions that shouldn&#x27;t be possible just by entering an admin password (which a LOT of software packages require during installation).<p>edit: also, they did include Hypervisor.Framework in 10.10 which is a significant engineering investment but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a purpose at the moment (major virtualization vendors aren&#x27;t likely to use it, neither are app developers. That leaves Apple...). I honestly wonder if they&#x27;re planning to use it for security purposes in 10.11+. They did something similar with XPC, introducing it for use by developers first, and then in 10.10 they started using it extensively to isolate things in the OS (including Extensions).<p>[1] <a href=""http://asciiwwdc.com/2013/sessions/707"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asciiwwdc.com/2013/sessions/707</a>",1433777769

I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with what they&#x27;re saying but: People are going to fantasize anyway, the fantasy is impeded without any possibility of it being fulfilled... they&#x27;re probably never going to marry a prince(ss), but some do. The dollar they spend makes the fantasy a possibility. Like the little girl playing dress up and make believing what it would be like before she ever has any real understanding of the reality. People fantasize about all kinds of things every day (most with no direct financial cost, except by what they&#x27;re not earning while they&#x27;re busy daydreaming), at the cost of things they probably <i>should</i> be worrying about, but don&#x27;t.<p>Day dreaming is a means of escaping your existing reality... but if you take <i>no</i> action, then your day dreaming is just that. You need to take action to give any possibility of it ever becoming more than that. In this case, the $5 for the ticket is that step. Perhaps the fantasy is what you live for. Perhaps you spend your life with your head buried in romance novels, who knows, the effect is the same - you paid $5 for the book which gave you a few good hours of day dreaming, or perhaps even a number of days of escape. The lottery ticket gave you a couple of hours escape before you come back to reality. It&#x27;s just a pleasant way to pass the time.

In short, the crappy clip art and cookie-cutter templates make me appraise it as authentic. I think that anyone who as ever dealt with any defense contracting bureaucracy, with their endless slides, documents, and so forth, would feel similarly.<p>These are people interested in making arguments, and dumping massive presentations on other people.  Defense IT is pretty much 99% Microsoft, and the people making presentations are neither designers nor (usually) people who care about optimum information delivery.  They add what flair they can.<p>Imagine the most restrictive IT department ever, with layers of bureaucracy hardened over years to prevent you from getting work done.  No one is going to open Photoshop and make custom photos, as no one can install it, and the military networks are so locked down that I&#x27;d be surprised if they could reach sites with stock photos. (OK, that&#x27;s probably allowed.)  I expect that the only things they have are MS OFfice and the stock clip art.",1433777153

I&#x27;ve purchased several apps (and generally paid more for them) when there was a free download that offers some functionality and the option to pay for the full version.  Sometimes these are games where the first chapter is free and then you pay $5 for the full game after you&#x27;ve played a bit.  It lowers the &quot;friction&quot; for the customer because you get to try something out at no cost but if you enjoy the first hour of play, you&#x27;re more confident that you&#x27;ll enjoy the other 5 hours.<p>Other times these are utilities.  The Philips Hue lamps have an official app that&#x27;s passable but the third party &quot;Hue Pro&quot; adds functionality.  The free version does basically what the Phiilps app does or you can pay $2 and unlock all of the &quot;fun&quot; addons like music sync and lava lamp mode.  Once I know that the app works and isn&#x27;t buggy, I&#x27;m glad to pay.  Same for launchers like Nova.  Free version is a nice launcher that I vastly prefer to the stock launcher but I can pay a few bucks and get several more options.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have paid $3 times 4 or 5 launchers just to find the one I liked but once I tried all of the free versions, I paid for the full version of the one I liked best.<p>It&#x27;s like shareware.  With the glut of options, you don&#x27;t want to pay every time you try several solutions to find the best one so you try a bunch then buy the best.  If I had to pay $1-10 to try every app on my phone, I&#x27;d just install less apps (or, to be honest, I&#x27;d probably try cracked copies to find the best option, then buy the best one).<p>As long as the quality of mobile apps is so varied, it really is hard to convince potential customers to pay any amount of money sight unseen.  I&#x27;ve installed so many iOS and Android apps that lasted a total of 10 minutes on my devices it&#x27;s not even funny.

I look forward to the day when the responsible members of society (people who pay their bills on time, who save for retirement, who don&#x27;t over-buy) are pushed even further to take care of the people who were immature and planned incredibly poorly.  Our society works fine when it&#x27;s assumed that a small portion of its members are irresponsible.  But when it&#x27;s systemic, there isn&#x27;t enough money to go around.<p>That&#x27;s what happened with the housing bubble.  Blaming banks is easy, and certainly they did a lot of shady stuff.  But nobody forced people to take on mortgages they couldn&#x27;t hope to pay.  Nobody forced kids to take out $100k in loans to go to a dream school instead of a state school.<p>The student loan debt burden is enormous.  And I suspect that the people who make out the worst in it will be the ones who actually PAY on time.  And I&#x27;m terrified of what will happen when it&#x27;s time to start cashing out my 401k.  After years of saving, a person who has faithfully saved $5M should have a nice retirement ahead of them.  But I suspect that so many more people will have nothing, and those people will still be voting, and cut themselves a hefty slice of the pie from those who actually planned ahead.  And because of the way 401k&#x27;s are set up, it&#x27;s a multi-trillion dollar pot of money that can be re-assigned from the &quot;$5m retirement rich&quot; people to those who didn&#x27;t bother to think ahead and save.<p>One person defaults on an irresponsible debt, no big deal.

It really is the one thing that I dislike about the platform.  The freemium model (when done properly) is something I vastly prefer as well.<p>I look at it like the old shareware titles.  I get a free demo that&#x27;s either time limited or where I need to pay to unlock the full version.  That way I can test the software or play the game or whatever, then if it&#x27;s something that meets my needs, I can pay $1-10, secure in the knowledge that I won&#x27;t be disappointed or surprised after buying something that turns out to be unwanted.<p>I&#x27;d say that the vast majority of apps and games I&#x27;ve purchased worked that way.  Free download, mess with the app or play the first 5 levels of the game and then when I run into the limit where I need to pay, it&#x27;s not a big deal because I know what I&#x27;m getting.  The plague that is pay-to-win or other microtransactions in games is awful but that&#x27;s probably not too relevant to this thread and is just as big a problem on iOS.<p>When I see the comments on the Play store or the App store, full of people complaining that the dev has the gall to ask for $1 or $2 for some useful or entertaining bit of code, it is very disappointing.  That&#x27;s the sort of money people pay for a Coke or to have someone drive a pizza 10 minutes to your house.  I feel like if I get more than a day or two&#x27;s use out of a mobile app, it&#x27;s easily worth at least a buck or two and I&#x27;d vastly prefer to pay once than to deal with popup ads or recurring subscriptions and microtransactions.",1433776404

Vision, voice, image processing, genetic analysis, communications, payment systems, medical records, you name it.<p>If you&#x27;re the first kind of programmer, do some programming with some of the tools that interest you to learn new things and broaden your experience/understanding.

While ubuntu offers 5 years of support on long-term support (lts) releases, desktop users tend to like the latest version and reinstall or upgrade every 6 months.

This often breaks packages with kernel dependencies, like graphics drivers, so it&#x27;s common to advocate a fresh install every release.

And my question would then be why do <i>you</i> think they&#x27;ll be useful only for a subset of programmers and a subset of projects?<p>> Types can be used to encode complicated invariants of software systems, which will be automatically be machine checked throughout the entire lifetime of your project.<p>I know they can, but so can other verification mechanisms that are less intrusive, or even pluggable types, like those that have recently been added to Java 8.<p>One point of difficulty -- that the article is talking about -- is precisely those variants that are really hard to enforce, like &quot;every request X will be handled within 300 ms&quot;, or &quot;the server will never respond Y if the user has never asked for Z&quot;, or &quot;the system will never contact the database if the operator has turned on the offline flag&quot;. Similar (though less sophisticated) kinds of guarantees <i>are</i> made and verified by Esterel, without requiring the programmer to supply the proof. Other approaches include behavioral programming[1] (made by the same people behind the research that had led to Esterel), which simply let you specify a rule: &quot;if offline flag is on, disable calls to the database&quot;, which will be enforced no matter how much lower priority rules try to access the database.<p>Types are just one approach for verification. There are invariants they excel at proving, and those that not so much. People who research type systems should, of course, explore anything that&#x27;s possible with them, but software developers should realize that types are not the be-all and end-all of writing verifiably correct programs, and that for some program properties there are better approaches than types.<p>> They model invariants, help design and allow easy reasoning over large software projects.<p>I agree in theory. But I also think they may help up to a certain point and then start hurting. The problem is, this has never been put to the test.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bprogram/more.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bprogram/more.html</a>",1433775920

Some careers are simply known to be very stressful - for example most transactional work (investment banking, corporate lawyers, accounting consulting). It <i>is</i> self-reinforcing in the sense that each company has to keep up with the competition, but I believe that would happen regardless of the level of stress students experience in school. Personally, I have managed to avoid such environments, but for some people, that&#x27;s the easiest, fastest and least risky way to success.",1426586367

But basically I agree that a university that is unable to maintain an inspiring atmosphere fails at its most basic job. Under stress, the brain is not receptive to new information. This is a very basic fact. Although handling stress is something to learn as well, education must not be stressful, except maybe prior to exams. If MIT students are under permanent stress, it is unlikely for them to learn and understand science. Hence, MIT can not be an elite university any more.",1426585566

Currently we use doc types (for which the IDE helps us heaps) and type hinting for objects being passed as arguments.<p>For a given process (e.g. form submission) there will nevertheless be an entry point where strings from the web are passed in. But if you can minimize that area as much as possible, beyond that one place (a function or class) which understands the mapping from incoming string types to PHP types, you end up with a code base which behaves mostly like a statically type language.<p>This has reduced a huge subset of bugs which are caused by unexpected input being passed to a function. Having the language itself tell you when you made an error statically while writing is much better than having to wait until runtime.<p>A similar argument would stand for why we moved from dynamically created strings sent to the database, towards a database abstraction layer where we pick up syntax errors at time of writing.",1426583998

The Mensa tests seemed like they were designed to be just easy enough to get several right answers, thereby piquing the interest of the test taker. Maybe you are smart enough to be in Mensa! Maybe you are smart enough to work at Edison! This test strikes me as 1920s era gamification.",1426583373

I went to a school when engineering was in high demand, and most of the students seemed to be in the program mainly because of the abundance of jobs.  Most of the students seemed to disdain people who were really interested in technology and science.  Most of the instructors were demoralized by the low quality of the students and had a lot of contempt for the students.  It was hard to find a lab partner who could do the work.  Most students seemed to be slackers and disparaged students who tried to do things outside of class.  The administration was uncaring as well.  It was a shitty experience and I had always been envious of the MIT, CalTech, and Berkeley students.  I have a lot more respect for the grads from those schools than from my school.",1426583356

of control.  Home owners listened to every angry word Howard Jarvis spewed out.  Even as a child, I knew that angry man was right.<p>(To be completely honest; I still think property taxes are too high.  All those bonds and temporary scare tactics add up.

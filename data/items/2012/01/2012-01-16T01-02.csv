3469011,comment,3467148,3468965,1,0,barrkel,,,"Well, in a market with perfect information, enough people and organizations would organize to donate money to fund the innovations :) (actually, I think this could be a better model for funding certain types of innovation, e.g. drugs for particular diseases, than patents). Of course, the market doesn't have perfect information, so there is not a 100% certainty on the return on these potential innovations. We must therefore discount them. But they are still valuable; and companies still have R&D departments that do blue-sky research, and we also have government funded R&D. Which you could argue Sputnik and reaction was about. I think these are also market behaviours.<p>So why do you think there is still a shortage, when there is in fact funding for innovation? Do you think the returns would be worth more investment, <i>diverted</i> from other current investments? If so, you should be able to convince enough other people to fund it. If not, does that not prove the weakness of your argument? ;)<p>(I'm arguing this with a hat on. That is, I'm taking a position that's actually somewhat more extreme than my real position, to see how it feels. I'm actually opposed to the market in many cases, but not because of quibbling over supply and demand, but rather because it is amoral - not immoral, amoral - as in it has no moral content. There is no intrinsic fairness in it. It just <i>is</i>, a machine driven by people's consumption, without consideration for whether their tastes are right or wrong.)",1326678810

   Namecoin is a peer-to-peer generic name/value datastore 
   system based on Bitcoin technology (a decentralized 
   cryptocurrency). It allows you to :

   Securely register names (domains for example), no 
   possible censorship!
   Trade and transact namecoins, the digital currency NMC.

   What is Dot-BIT

   Dot-BIT, the first project using namecoin, is building a 
   domain name system (DNS) using the .bit TLD. Our goal is 
   to spread .bit domains by providing resources and tools 
   to the community, from developers to end users.

3468992,comment,3468419,3468419,2,0,6ren,,,"Someone said that passion is ""love and anger together"". Passion originally meant <i>to suffer</i>.
It seems that passion (motivation) causes action, but it happens the other way too. You act, making some progress, and <i>then</i> you feel motivated.
Any worthwhile accomplishment involves suffering and sacrifice. Maybe passion isn't the only way. Maybe even <i>deciding</i> to suffer doesn't matter, provided you do it.<p>Every moment we do not spend ourselves in a worthy cause is simply a moment not spent in a worthy clause. Each moment we are given, we get for free. It is up to us how we spend it. Throughout our lives, no matter how we spend it, we are given another in the very next instant.<p>Some startups weren't based on a specific idea. e.g. Woz and Jobs first had a go at blue boxes. HP and Sony began trying a few different products. The motivation was more like: to make something cool, make a business work. If you like, the ""idea"" had a wider scope than a specific product. I think it's fair to say they were passionate - as in crazy motivated - about that. e.g. Woz loved making cool electronic stuff; Jobs loved making a business out of that.
It's not a specific idea; though I suppose you could say they were passionate about each specific idea in a general class.<p>I feel there are two parts to my own passion: (1) that there's an opportunity (problem, need, cool new idea) that would make a difference; and (2) that <i>I</i> could do it.
That second one is very important. If I don't think it's within my reach, I won't feel excited. Maybe I'll even feel a little depressed and inadequate. That's why confidence (aka faith, hope, courage) is so important. pg noted a few times that not knowing how hard it is can be a blessing - that some very capable founders would have thought their achievement was beyond their ability if they knew the obstacles involved.",1326678385

Sure, they can make it pretty and shiny, but I see them balking on the harder engineering challenges.<p>For example, because I was one of the doomed MobileMe users, I ended up having two Apple IDs for my Apple assets.  As a result of moving to iCloud, I had to ditch one set of assets.  Apple assumes you only have one Apple ID, which is fine, but they do not offer you a way to merge two Apple accounts.  In other words, their walled garden is so tightly walled it doesn't even play nicely with itself.<p>Another example is that they don't have a good user experience around communicating what is going to happen when moving data from one device to another.  I had the hardest time getting my contacts from my old iPhone to iCloud.  What ended up happening is that I had to manually transfer the info (yes, look at the iPhone contacts, type them into a file, then manually type them back into my new iPhone) and actually in the process of moving to iCloud I accidentally deleted all of my contacts without warning.  Oops!<p>So Apple is still really green when it comes to smoothing out all of the rough edges of this complex engineering challenge.

If I'm taking 75% of the salary I would in a fortune 500 gig, I already consider myself 3/4s diversified. Plus, I can always work 4 startups in 4 years and just take the first cliff worth of stock, which diversifies even more. Granted, it's no mutual fund, but it's not ""I'm locked in to one company for 1/10 of my life and if they go under I'm bankrupt"". It's a little less money for as long as I choose to work there in exchange for a potential return on investment.<p>If I were go back and look for an equity heavy gig, and I don't plan to, I would look at the entire process as an early stage investor. No, I can't invest in 10 or 20 different companies, but I can be selective and increase my odds.

I never said that the content provisions were perfect; I'm not a big fan of some language and some behaviors that are in the content takedown sections of the DMCA. It could certainly be modified and improved, and I'd be all for that.

One of the ways I evaluate this is to ask: if I'm using a compiled client-side language, and the service api is modified in a backward-compatible way, will I need to recompile my client? With SOAP the answer is often yes because the client-side library generates code that is binary-dependent on the datatypes in the wsdl. That's bad, and one of the huge advantages of a RESTful api is that recompiles aren't needed. Your resource representation can change, so long as the informationn that was there before is still there and can be found using the same expression (eg: an id lookup in an xml document, or by a key in json data.)",1326675887

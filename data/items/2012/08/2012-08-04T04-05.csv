Now if want to continue to create products that scale into billion dollar companies, create thousands of jobs and transform society, we need to add domain experts to the founding DNA of Technology Companies.</i><p>A bunch of us were talking about this over the table at the Chez JJ Hacker Hostel. Apparently, there are a lot of <i>horrible</i> medical apps. This is because domain experts can't communicate well with doctors. So some doctor with minimal programming experience writes some software. By chance, it takes off and gets huge, growing into spaghetti code in the process, adding to the reasons why the best hackers dont' work on medical software.<p>You can apply this to any number of disciplines.<p><i>> These founders don't want to change to world. They just want to make enough money to provide for their family, buy a car, or earn their freedom.

Are you admitting that you have no counterargument to the video, which argues that space elevators are too impractical to be made in the forseeable future, or just pretending I didn't post it?<p>And by argument above, do you mean your paranoid rantings about government takeover of SpaceX? Personally, I'm more worried about corporations having too much influence on the government, not the other way around.<p>As for your nationalisation examples:<p>1. The gold confiscation had nothing to do with private companies<p>2. oil nationalisation didn't take place in America<p>3. I have no idea what in the 70's you're refering to<p>4. Bailouts: I'm going to go out on a limb and say that SpaceX will never be so integral to the national economy that it can't fail without taking down the whole system. Nor that Elon Musk will take on so much risk that he is in danger of failing.<p>And you can't have it both ways, Mr. ""However, lazy quips aside, the past is not the future.""

Certainly there are still some big, Google-level ideas out there to be had, but there are other industries out there in which big idea can, should, and must form for us to advance as a civilization.<p>Map the human genome or build the next Farmville?<p>Find a way to grow food 300% more efficiently to meet the growing demands of the world population or make an iPhone app?<p>Why must everything be internet-based and somehow have to best Google?<p>Additionally, I think the author is having trouble filtering out the so called ""noise"" from the signal. I, for one, think it's terrific that a whole new class of small or ""mom and pop"" businesses can now exist on the Internet. Does that give us huge advancements as a species? Usually not, but hopefully it's paying their rent, which is great for them.<p>Yes, we need big ideas to move forward, but don't begrudge the next generation of Internet-based small businesses.

I have to invent a word here because we haven't coined one yet, but its a device you use to surf the web, read email, chat on facebook, edit our resumes, Etc.

Those will be distinguished as being ""General Purpose"" computers as opposed to ""Task specific"" computers. They may even share the same instruction set architecture with their counterparts, but it should be perfectly Ok for a task specific device to refuse to run any code that hasn't been verified though some system of trust.<p>The comments about unlocking phone bootloaders, or the iPad, are quite relevant here. Those devices, when locked, aren't general purpose computers. Locked they can be task specific and reasonably safe [1]. Without such barriers they put their users at unnecessary risk and for users who have neither the ability nor the time to understand the risks that is a good thing.<p>[1] ""reasonably safe"" - This discussion will often jump to 'nothing is 100% secure' which is true of course and not the point. Planes fall out of the sky and kill people, but they are 'reasonably safe' which means that the risk of them killing us is acceptable given the benefit returned. Similarly with cars. Computers these days are not 'reasonably safe'.

The first reason is that many of the huge industries are backed by so much money, poltics, and legality and so ingrained into society that they are virtually impossible to disrupt. That said, there is still a slow but steady disruption attempting to take place in education...

The definition of ""unstable features"" is a bit nebulous, and it depends on whether you're trying to support all browsers - WebKit is apparently dragging their feet on unprefixing, say, CSS transitions, but Internet Explorer doesn't support them at all - but for most of the relatively old features like that, the spec is settled, so a combination of shims for existing browsers, which libraries can and do provide, and preferred use of the unprefixed feature should pretty much work forever.",1344054405

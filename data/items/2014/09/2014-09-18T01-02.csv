On the top 2 of the things I like about Go they are tooling and removed inheritance.<p>Being able to fire up a fully formed, non-handicapped environment consisting of only vim and some command line tools is great.  I&#x27;ve tried repeatedly on the JVM to accomplish this and always end up back with bloated IntelliJ and the vim plugin as my only option.<p>I would say that in the last 15 years I&#x27;ve used inheritance correctly a handful of times, embedded structs are nearly always the correct solution to data structure reuse problems.  That Go prioritizes composition over inheritance for data structure reuse is one of its fundamental value propositions, that anyone that has used Java extensively thinks otherwise is baffling to me.<p>If Go had a longer history I&#x27;d probably argue the exact opposite conclusion of you.  If you are a small shop with scanty resources and need to build practical business solutions Go seems like a great choice.  Conversely, if you are able to afford the best developers and have massive enterprise software needs, maybe Java or .Net makes more sense.",1411005294

Baumeister is one of several psychologists who sometimes hypothesizes from an evolutionary psychology perspective. The &quot;Evolutionary Psychology Primer&quot; by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby[2] is often taken to be the definitive discussion of what evolutionary psychology is as an intellectual movement. An article from <i>American Psychologist</i> in 2010, &quot;Evolutionary Psychology: Controversies, Questions, Prospects, and Limitations&quot;[3] by young women (perhaps that&#x27;s significant here) who had recently finished graduate study in evolutionary psychology argues that evolutionary psychology has important contributions to make to psychology research in general. Every psychologist I know is sure that human beings originated from a process of biological evolution, but I don&#x27;t meet a lot of working psychologists who describe themselves as evolutionary psychologists. The Wikipedia articles on evolutionary psychology seem to be beset by edit wars between supporters and critics of that perspective, rather than combining both points of view in one balanced article with lots of good references.<p>A psychologist with a contrasting point of view is Janet Hyde,[4] a psychologist well trained in human behavior genetics. She has published papers suggesting that most supposed innate gender differences between men and women are shaped mostly by culture rather than by biological inheritance.<p>See what you think after reading some of the key documents.

Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment. Patients with mental disorders deserve better.&quot;<p>By the way. Insel isn&#x27;t a Scientologist, he&#x27;s a psychiatrist.

So, we have Go and Rust growing rapidly and being well accepted and loved, so, not hard to imagine 10 years from now! I&#x27;m sure PyPy and other alternative implementations would be leading the parade at that time and possibly will take the language in a different direction adding incompatible feature to utilize best their specific platform and be competitive - similarly to what HHVM is to PHP. Life&#x27;s moving at a faster pace now, every product has embraced the rapid release cycle, and Python seems too slow to evolve.

It does not matter what the rationale behind the committee&#x27;s decision was.</i><p>This is quite a narrow-minded line of thinking. You&#x27;re saying &quot;Feature X is should be excluded because of <possible consequence>&quot;. But we can say the converse about this same feature: &quot;Feature Y should be included because <possible benefit>&quot;. Every programming language feature ever has had its pros and cons, and every language designer makes tradeoffs deciding which features to include and which to exclude.[1]<p>You also most likely overestimate the practical unreadability of the source code. IDEs are (or will be) smart enough to deduce and display the type of an auto declared variable[2] when you want it. For short functions, it will be blindingly obvious what the auto-declared return type of a function is. Using auto will vastly improve readability by reducing textual noise when a function returns (1) heavily templated expressions, (2) any type within a deeply-nested namespace, (3) any type with a long name, or especially (4) combinations of the previous three (e.g. std::vector::const_iterator< std::pair<std::string, double> >). Complicated types are a common issue in languages with static type systems[3].<p>I could go on. There are tons of use-cases where auto will help out. The biggest complaint I have is that you can auto-declare the return type of methods that return private variables from a class (unless I&#x27;m mistaken; I haven&#x27;t actually tried it). This pokes leaky holes in your class&#x27;s encapsulation, forming dependencies between external code and your class&#x27;s private, internal implementation (although this may be possible through template magic...).<p><i>The barbarians are already at the gate. Which side are you going to pick?</i><p>Oh, cut the drama. Every language has some sort of a style guide, and C++ programmers are already used to following a style guide and programming with discipline. One more feature with a few downsides and a number of benefits is not going to make a difference, and is totally in line with its philosophy[1].<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Philosophy</a>\n2: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/19625115"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/q/19625115</a>\n3: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10448"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10448</a>",1411002217

7113563,comment,7110053,7110768,3,0,strlen,,,"> about how computers and the Internet catalyze harm, by shielding people who cause harm from the impact of their action<p>In general distance from a victim shields people from experiencing the impact of their actions. My late grandfather was an artillerist on the Soviet side in World War 2: he talked about how soldiers would vomit, fall ill, and cry after visibly killing enemy soldiers for the first time with short-range handheld arms (i.e., grenades, rifles, submachine guns, bayonets, or pistols). Yet, himself, when shelling remote positions with full understanding the shells -- in addition to killing much larger groups of enemy soldiers than bullets -- may have also killed civilians (which for most of the war generally meant Soviet or other allied civilians).<p>This isn&#x27;t about moral rationalization -- obviously resisting Nazis and winning World War II was a good thing -- but emotional reaction. To get back on topic, what I think happens here isn&#x27;t someone thinking that somehow committing one crime electronically vs. physically is less severe; it&#x27;s that one&#x27;s disgust with what they&#x27;re doing is less, which makes a various rationalizations (whether correct or incorrect) for one&#x27;s actions easier to accept.<p>> I don&#x27;t know what you do about the guy who fed his admin credentials to Anonymous to help them deface a newspaper.<p>I am trying to draw a comparison here with someone either letting an unauthorized person enter the printing rooms of a newspaper (and as a result something other than a newspaper was printed and delivered). Yet that isn&#x27;t quite right: someone with physical access to printing room of a newspaper could have done even greater damage.<p>Another comparison could be with a newspaper boy agreeing to deliver a sarcastic parody of a paper in place of the actual paper. Yet that too isn&#x27;t quite right, as it&#x27;s far easier for the newspaper to recover promptly, and the damage is localized.<p>All of those things are hard to answer.",1390543119

How exactly do you &quot;vote with your feet&quot; when company management&#x27;s are colluding together to prevent just that?<p>Management and ownership has not only been organizing to protect their interests, they&#x27;ve even crossed the line into breaking the law, as they did here.

If you want some cheap, bare bone VPS&#x27;s, DigitalOcean has worked for us.<p>+ After shopping around, $5/month for a 512MB ram server is about as cheap as you can get.<p>+ Simple to spin up a VPS (as opposed to Azure, which requires you to jump through hoops if you just want a Linux server).<p>+ Great API for managing VPS&#x27;s- simple, solid and intuitive (although AWS/EC2, while more complex due to additional features, is also very intuitive).<p>+ Great customer support - you can browse to creating a new VPS or opening a new ticket from the same page. Easy support and quick responses.<p>(+/-)? VERY basic VPS hosting. They provide the minimum amount of distance between yourself and your server. You need to be command line friendly. A good example of the difference between DigitalOcean and AWS/EC2 is that you will need to manage your own firewall (with EC2 they do it for you via security groups). For me the reduced distance is a plus, but if you are inquiring about technology supported this may be a minus for you.<p>(+/-)? Lack of PaaS features: this is IaaS, you will be given a VPS somewhere on the interwebs, and you will need to be able to manage it. If you need support for MongoDB, Rails or the like this may not be for you. You will need to install/configure the entire stack.<p>- Downtime! We migrated our entire infrastructure from EC2 to DigitalOcean around October(ish?) 2013. In that time period there have been 3 significant data centre outages (one lasting an hour or two).

Just look at all the companies who constantly have open headcount. If wage suppression in our industry were caused by an excess of supply, you&#x27;d expect there to be lots of unemployed software engineers—but there are barely any.

I just dredged it up:<p>&quot;Clearly the tech talent shortage can&#x27;t be that bad, otherwise salaries would be going through the roof. I realize they may seem high relative to many other professions, however if we really are in dire straights, one would expect them to have spiked dramatically. That just hasn&#x27;t happened. Either collectively the valley is colluding to not inflate wages, or, more likely, the problem isn&#x27;t as big as many companies are making it out to be and those companies want to bring in foreign workers to help put deflationary pressure on wages.&quot;<p>I guess it turns out that was a false dichotomy and both things were happening. It looks like there was a conspiracy, and the tech companies still complained about not being able to find workers while pressuring congress for more H1-B visas.<p>My point is I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to really get an accurate picture of how much wages were depressed because many companies are trying their hardest to decrease workforce mobility any way possible (legal or otherwise).  I&#x27;ve personally seen some pretty crazy shenanigans at a very large tech company with workers being steered through insane hurdles to get a green card.<p>And I guess why not?  If you can get someone to stick around for 5 or 6 years at a reduced wage, why wouldn&#x27;t you do that?",1390540403

The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little, as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter in order to lower, the wages of labour.</i><p><i>It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily: and the law, besides, authorises, or at least does not prohibit, their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work, but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes, the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks, which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year, without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.</i><p>Marx, you ask?  No.  Engles?

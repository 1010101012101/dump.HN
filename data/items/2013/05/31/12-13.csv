There is nothing for the parent poster to feel ashamed about. Nothing he said is shame worthy.<p>2. He wasn't aggressive. It wasn't a knee-jerk reaction. It wasn't unprofessional, rude or childish.<p>3. The author of the bug didn't make a mistake. They submitted a bug report designed to be as brutal and belittling as possible. They didn't just lose their temper in the heat of the moment, they decided to setup a new account under a pseudoname, then blasted the author of the software product.<p>4. Writing software is indeed a team effort, but as with any team if one party abuses the other the team rapidly becomes less effective.<p>5. Feedback doesn't have to be abusive. It's a bit rich to say on the one hand feedback can be abusive, but on the other hand that abusive feedback must be then taken in a ""civilized manner"". Do you not see the contradiction?<p>6. There's nothing ""prudish"" about remarking that abusive bug reports don't make the bug get fixed faster or better. To be a prude, you must be excessively concerned about propriety, and there's nothing in the parent's comment that is excessive.<p>7. The parent's comment was a general comment, and wasn't an attempt to fix the bug. There's nothing misplaced about the poster's priorities. He's here to comment on HN, and that is indeed what he's done.",1370005188
5798284,comment,5796880,5797117,20,0,FD3SA,,,"Indeed, putting the old clues together with his new hints narrows it done quite precisely.<p>It will be a Ground Effect lifting body on an electromagnetic rail. The lift is provided by aerodynamic effects, and thrust is provided by electromagnetic force.<p>Based on the details of the design, it would be capable of supersonic speeds like the Concord, while employing Ground Effect like an air hockey table, and propelled like a Rail Gun.<p>The biggest challenges will be keeping the vehicle stable and at a constant distance from the power rail at high speeds, as aerodynamic disturbances can destabilize the vehicle. Given Elon's expertise with rockets, this should not be too difficult.<p>EDIT:<p>An prototype of a ground effect train:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOnrIRf_Mg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOnrIRf_Mg</a><p>Elon's will use electromagnetic propulsion instead of electric fans.<p>EDIT 2: I just realized this may be Elon's electric jet idea. He may use a ram-air electric jet at high speeds, and only use the power rail to get the vehicle to supersonic speeds where the ram-air engines are most efficient. This would make it MUCH cheaper than maglev by eliminating the power rail on the majority of the track.<p>EDIT 3: Rail gun diagram.<p><a href=""http://www.howstuffworks.com/rail-gun1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howstuffworks.com/rail-gun1.htm</a><p>The walls of the guideway will likely house the propulsion system.",1370005174

9052110,comment,9051562,9051562,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Short story about exception filters: they&#x27;re mostly there for crash dumps.<p>The background is that there is a piece of functionality in Windows previously called Watson, now called Windows Error Reporting. It&#x27;s that dialog that pops up when an application crashes that asks if you&#x27;d like to report the crash to Microsoft. If you do, it sends a crash dump to Microsoft, where it can then be routed to the owner of the application, even if the application isn&#x27;t actually developed by Microsoft.<p>So a lot of developers in the know have designed their applications so that unrecoverable errors actually purposely cause the application to crash so that they can get a dump from WER. One of the standard ways of doing this is simply wrapping your code in a catch at the top level and then calling Environment.FailFast to crash the process.<p>The problem is that sometimes the stack is destroyed in this process. Note that I didn&#x27;t say the stack trace -- the <i>stack</i> is destroyed. You can see this if you catch and rethrow an exception. The locals from the original exception are gone, so now the dump is far more difficult to debug.<p>Exception filters let you get around this because they don&#x27;t actually pop anything, including the exception, from the stack, so if you FailFast, you crash with the full stack of the process.<p>A number of .NET developers had previously figured this out and were doing a bunch of nasty stuff to get this behavior, like including a VB net module with an exception filter fail-fast, or ildasm/ilasming their assembly. We tried a bunch of these methods on the compiler and they were all a source of many really obnoxious bugs, so eventually another compiler developer and I just said &quot;screw it&quot; and implemented exception filters in C#. All the bugs went away and we lived happily ever after.<p>Oh, and now exception filters are in the language.",1423990639

So it uses parens if there are no params, but not otherwise?<p>Again not surprising, a leading `=>` would be a syntax error so `()` is an obvious compromise which can be naturally be extended to add args, e.g:<p><pre><code>    evens.map((v) => v + 1)\n\n</code></pre>\n> Seriously another String delimiter?<p><pre><code>    `Hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?`\n</code></pre>\nYep, String interpolation is incredibly useful especially in JavaScript which does a lot of string munging - this will lead to more succinct, readable code. Should be obvious why they didn&#x27;t want to break existing JS by re-using &quot;&quot; double-quotes.<p>> Why aren&#x27;t we just using #{} like everyone else?<p>Who&#x27;s everyone else (Ruby inspired langs)? Scala uses ${1 + 1} or $var shorthand (same as Groovy, Kotlin, JSP EL, Haxe), C# 6 uses {var}, Swift uses \(var) whilst Python and Java have string formats that use %(var)<p><pre><code>    var [a, , b] = [1,2,3];\n</code></pre>\n> Is that seriously just whitespace and another comma?<p>It&#x27;s clearly ignoring matching the second element. Some languages choose to use `_` as a special ignore placeholder, JavaScript chose not to. Either way is not unintuitive with what it does so that&#x27;s ok.<p>The other features are extremely useful if you need them, otherwise you can happily ignore them and use the subset you&#x27;re comfortable with.",1423990405

I&#x27;ve never had a problem beyond minimal weight gain with anything I&#x27;ve ever used (multiple forms of pills, nuvaring, depo, mirena IUD) and same for many of my female friends are in my situation, while I have some that only stick with very specific brands/types, and some that swore off birth control altogether.<p>I&#x27;m pretty happy that the implant is so effective for something so minimally invasive (in comparison to sterilization), personally, and I&#x27;ll be considering it for my next form of birth control.

First - exception messages could be internationalized. Second - general string comparison should be done with InvariantCulture, and case-ignorant (and usually strings are trimmed).

9052055,comment,9049208,9049208,0,0,chipsy,,,"If the &quot;fun part&quot; of learning or working on a project is analogous to the climbing of a mountain, you have to acknowledge that there are parts of learning and working that have natural plateaus - you wander in them for a long time and you don&#x27;t seem to be climbing at all. There are only two ways to consistently get through those spots: by habit, or by obligation.<p>By obligation is the more familiar method for a student: You were told to do your homework and study, now you have to deliver. And then you fear not fulfilling it so you get into a panic at the last minute and scramble to produce the image, if not the reality, of someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing and learned what they were supposed to learn. Somehow you retain some of that knowledge and so you do become more competent, but you associate the process of getting there with the stressful experience of delivering to a deadline.<p>Doing it by habit means that there is a part of your time in the day where you do some subset of &quot;important but boring&quot; things, entirely for yourself. Not because somebody told you to. This is the sane way to learn things and also the only one that you can sustain throughout your life.<p>That is, tomorrow, instead of sitting in your comfort zone at home and watching yet another lecture or skimming yet another blog post, you go out to a coffee shop and you sit there for at least one hour to study &quot;the doing of work.&quot; You don&#x27;t dare get up until you&#x27;ve seen at least a tiny fraction of productivity. Maybe you learned one fact, or you figured out one part of a math problem, or you set up your development environment, or you wrote one important business email. If you accomplish it at the start of the hour, you keep going, you find one more thing to do, and then one more after that, and so on.<p>This feels horrible in the homework mindset, because the goal there is to minimize effort and maximize output, to procrastinate and then rush to get the grade. Here the goal is akin to going to the gym, to practice putting in effort, to get used to the idea of everyday struggle so that you don&#x27;t fear it. Here, it <i>does not matter</i> how little your output was, if your effort was good. And if you are frustrated with what you are trying to work on, allow yourself multiple options. You shouldn&#x27;t do only bicep curls every day, and you shouldn&#x27;t do the same with intellectual work.<p>The homework mindset will creep in and say that this free time should be carved up, rebalanced, and associated with deadlines again, in line with whatever goals and values the parents, teachers, or institutions presently uphold, you should be progressing as fast as the course does, but that is not true. You don&#x27;t know what is efficient, you don&#x27;t know what is valuable, and you don&#x27;t know exactly where you&#x27;re going in the future. You won&#x27;t progress exactly as fast as any course, you will breeze through some things and be stuck on others. You will have to try to know. Defer to <i>your own motivations</i> in practicing the doing of work, because sitting there dumbfounded by material you cannot bring yourself to engage with is a good way to crush your spirit and make you feel incapable. This is true even if it should lead to failure within your coursework, as that failure, in tandem with knowing that you were actually practicing and learning things each day, will indicate that you were lying to yourself about what you want and why. That is more important than simply maintaining the image of competence.<p>Try make sure you are actually as healthy as possible. Maybe you are eating or drinking something that makes you unable to focus, or not enough of something else - experiment, try things. Maybe you need to get out so that when you come back, you&#x27;re excited about what you&#x27;re doing. There are many things to try. A well-rounded life needs to try as many of them as possible as early as possible.",1423987262

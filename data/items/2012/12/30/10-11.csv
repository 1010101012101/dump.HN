4985384,comment,4979938,4981490,2,0,konstruktor,,,"I would absolutely recommend the Roman Stoics. The privileged ones lived like kings, but were prone to lose everything if the political climate changed. Their lives were absolutely unpredictable and they found ways of dealing with it in their heads. One can read advice from a philosopher/teacher who was later killed by his disciple (Seneca, forced to commit suicide by Nero), maybe the best Roman emperor ever (Marcus Aurelius) or a slave who was freed only later in life (Epicetus). Those guys knew that nothing was theirs forever but dealt with it in a graceful way.",1356865058

He's not saying 5-10% should be, but COULD be meat or animal products (including eggs, dairy, etc). 0% is also fine or even better. He allows this percentage because some people find it too restrictive to be vegetarian or vegan. So optimally you should keep it as low as possible, but there isn't much lost if you still keep it around 5%. Most people don't realize one egg is already that amount. You'd have to eat vegan the rest of the day to stay within limits. Animal products can be used as condiments to flavor your food, not as a substantial part of your diet.

We've raised our seed (GBP 55k) entirely from our active users who were very enthusiastic about supporting us.

We'll likely still be based in London, but we know that we'll need basic stuff in the USA too.<p>Hence, before those problems arrive the purpose of the trip is:<p>1) To build some VC contacts so that we can start plotting our growth chart in front of them and hopefully have them as investors when that time comes.<p>2) To make sense of how SF works with a view to understanding where to base and why, should we need to move on that sooner rather than later.<p>Not to say it <i>will</i> be SF, it could be Chicago. But I know Chicago as a town already, and I know zip about San Francisco.<p>Being so non-scene I also don't have a network or address book in which I can call someone up and say, ""Hey, throw some doors open, and help show me around, and which of these social things should I go to?"". So we're coming in quite cold, which is why LDN2SFO appealed to us... but we've given ourselves an extra week to get a deeper understanding and perhaps build some relationships that could be mutually beneficial in the future.<p>In some respects the Berlin, London, Barcelona startup scenes have, by necessity, already documented this stuff quite well. But San Francisco seems so large and established that there's a lack of a curated ""The SF startup scene guide"".

You've only got a week or so and it'll go quickly. I would forget all about VCs, they will sort themselves of their own accord if/when the time is right. Seeing and getting a feel for the city and the surrounding area is far more important in my opinion.<p>Hire a car. I was a little hesitant about driving in America at first, but it's actually very easy compared to driving in the UK (and trivial compared to London). Remember you can usually go through a red light if you're turning right! Driving will save you a lot of time and effort as public transport around SF is very limited (again compared to London) and it's quite a big city to walk around. Hiring a car is easy to do, we just walked into one of the many hire car depots on Mission and signed up on the spot.<p>If it's a sunny day then take a couple of hours to drive south down the 1 highway (the Pacific coast highway).

Changing access control patterns so that not a single person but at least two persons must allow the job to run are sufficient as a quick fix. They also mention changing the future architecture to automate such maintenance jobs and to make data recovery faster. So it is indeed a mix of process and technical measures, much as the problem was caused by more of a process problem rather than a technical problem.<p>Finally I don't think that the computational part of the data recovery is the time intensive one. A laptop may churn through gigabytes and gigabytes a minute, but a developer can't. In this case the more time intensive part is probably figuring out which parts of the data got lost and how to get them back, then writing the tools to automate the process, test that the data fits and then put it safely back in production.

If you check my comment history, you will see I'm quite the MOAI fanboix, and I've given a fair bit of details about how it works - so please check my history for more info.<p>In a nutshell, I use Linux to develop MOAI applications, and I use the Linux-native MOAI host to test/develop/code for it.  It works like this: Fire up SublimeText2, write Lua code for the MOAI framework, run the MOAI host with that Lua code on my local Linux DAW.  Check in the MOAI Lua code to my repo - wait for my build server on OSX to check it out, package it into an .ipa file, run it on the iOS devices plugged into my Macbook.<p>You would still need XCode somewhere to deploy to iOS - but you can do all the development on Linux or Windows, and the MOAI app won't <i>just</i> run on iOS - but also Linux, OSX native, Chrome Native Client, Android <i>and</i> iOS.<p>And before you worry that performance won't be great - performance is great.  :)  And there is no greater feeling in the world right now than to be developing an app on Linux, and in a few seconds watching that same app being deployed immediately on Android and iOS devices in my lab, without too much fuss.  Same look, same feel, same app: completely different platforms.<p>I really encourage you to check it out - and as long as you can convince someone to run the XCode build phase for you, somewhere, you can deploy to iOS simply as another target architecture, alongside all the other archs that your Linux machine can support (in my case my Linux machine also builds the Android product..)<p>If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to come to the MOAI forums and ask:  <a href=""http://http://getmoai.com/forums/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http://getmoai.com/forums/</a>",1356862822

I feel they are owed the basic right to life, freedom from suffering, and an equal right to that which they have an interest in, such as raising their young.  For every qualification you could find to rationalize treating animals poorly, aside from the species label we have applied to them, the same qualifications can be found in certain people.  That's why it gets fuzzy and icky to start calculating ""smart trades"" that compromise the rights of some for the good of others.<p>You should check out Animal Liberation by Peter Singer.

SF is a beautiful city and I want to go back very soon.<p>With that said I'm not sure what the purpose of this trip is (I did read your objectives). Some food for thought below.<p>> ""A very high-level view of where a few startups and VCs are located.""<p>You're based in London, which means you have access to some excellent global VC houses (Balderton, Index, Accel + others). There is a proliferation of small (<500k) money in London which is also easy to tap into. There are plenty of outstanding startups who are based in London. What do you gain by going to SF that you couldn't get by setting up a few meetings in London?<p>> one that requires a US entity within a year, we want to get a good sense of how SF can be done bootstrapped, or at least affordably<p>A lot can change in 12 months. It's hard to envisage a situation in which you're making a smart decision by expanding to the US within 12 months without either the capital to make it relatively pain-free, or the traction required to do Series A. It's also hard to think that groundwork you do now is going to be useful or inform that move in any way shape or form. If you're in a situation where you absolutely must be in the US within the next 12 months then maybe, but otherwise just cross that bridge when you come to it.<p>> Figure out how SF/SV works from a startup perspective\n [] build a few connects with VCs who might later become investors<p>SF/SV works the same way as London, Berlin or Paris: you can get swept up in scenester nonsense or you can spend your time working on your product and focusing on steps 1-20, not on steps 2000-3000.<p>In six months time if you have a good product, excellent traction and some revenues (+ ideas about 10x growth) then you will find that investors and interesting people won't be a problem. A good intro goes a long way, but it doesn't matter that much. It's platitudinal now but still true.<p>Everything is dictated by the focus you apply over the next few months. If I were bootstrapping my company I would be focusing relentlessly on building and testing assumptions.<p>So my advice is to have a GREAT time, see as much of the city as you can and have zero expectations. If there are any startups in your space in SF, drop them a line and go say hello. Drink beer with the people who are on the trip with you. Bond with your cofounder. Then come back to London and work seriously on the thing which will determine 99.9999% of your success.",1356862281

These days the real threat there is the monstrous computing power available to compute tons of hashes simultaneously.  To combat that, you want a hashing function specifically designed to be <i>slow</i>.  And not just slow, but to have a tunable parameter so you can require more and more work as GPUs get faster and cheaper.  PBKDF2 is such a function, and is used by Django as of a year or two ago.  bcrypt is another.",1371167889

It must be the shipping of the bits over the pacific that jacks the price up right?<p>Yes, eventually the prices drop, and you can buy a game that originally retailed for almost $100 for under $20, but that takes a long time.

5877451,comment,5873052,5877249,5,0,sirclueless,,,"There is a difference. Having a request or application context that encapsulates state is one thing, an architectural decision that simplifies multi-tenancy and makes many uses of Flask more performant. These are &quot;simple&quot;, in that they are an obvious and easily-explained solution to a technical problem that exists by necessity.<p>Global proxies to local state are another beast entirely. They are &quot;easy&quot; in that they remove the need to pass application and request objects through every called function, but they are not &quot;simple&quot; -- they rely on intimate details and peculiarities of Python&#x27;s module and import system, and its capacity for thread-local state, not to mention Python&#x27;s robust context unwinding features in the case of exceptions. Overuse of context-proxies leads to the same software engineering challenges as overuse of globals, in that it becomes difficult to reason about the calling semantics of functions which rely on context state being present, or mutate context state through proxies. For example, in order to test a view function, you will at a minimum need to set up an application context, but also need to set up any custom context your app relies on. It&#x27;s not always obvious how to do this, leading to documentation [1] that I notice has already been confusing people on the mailing list.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t conflate the two mechanisms. Application- and request-local context is a pre-requisite for multi-tenant applications and a conceptual simplification. Module-level proxies are a cute trick that makes programmers&#x27; lives easier, but undoubtedly creates more convoluted semantics and internal operation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/testing/#faking-resources-and-context"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/testing/#faking-resources-and-co...</a>",1371167548

It represents special interest groups, which is a euphemism for &quot;those who have money.&quot; Once your mind makes that paradigm shift, everything becomes incredibly easy to understand.<p>The fact of the matter is that the seeming irrationality and inefficiency of American government is a feature, rather than a bug. The inefficiency and general waste in government affairs actually serve to obfuscate the real functions and purpose of the state and makes reform vastly more complex and costly than it otherwise would be. The example I like to give is the tax code. The income tax started out as a tax on wealth and it used to be that only a very small percentage of households paid anything. Over time though, the burden of taxation shifted downward onto the middle class, while the elite simultaneously found alternative means of storing their wealth to avoid taxation almost completely. The problem is that the tax code is so complex now that most people cannot even comprehend the amount of loopholes in it. The only people who can are tax attorneys working for corporations and the ultra-rich. This is what I mean by the inefficiency and general waste serves to obfuscate the issue.<p>And the funny thing is, this is all working exactly as intended. The wealthy tightly control the system and the rest of the population is too distracted fighting for the crumbs to actually organize, form meaningful alliances and fight to change the status quo. What they do instead is share news articles and memes on Facebook and sign silly petitions on the Internet to be able to pat themselves in the back for fighting the good fight. They just want to feel good about themselves.<p>At the end of the day, this is because the vast majority of people don&#x27;t actually care about the events that happen around them. They care about their self-perceived role in those events and their own feelings. You can actually see this type of behavior in many different cases outside politics. Take something as simple as exercise. A lot of people sign up for personal trainers, not because they actually want to exercise correctly and lose weight, but because <i>the act of making superficial effort (such as paying a small amount of money) towards a goal is sufficient to make them feel good.</i> And if they fail at weight loss, they can tell themselves that, well, they at least tried.

But so many projects end up wasting a lot of resources, or even end up locking screen orientation when they first ship because they didn&#x27;t take this seriously.<p>The other side of this coin is that a simple wireframe can get implemented on iOS quickly, while on Android, the coders may spend a lot of time on multiple layouts, multiple sets of graphical assets, different font sizes, different screen dimensions and densities, etc. It often helps if the designer participates in creating and testing layouts and assets for an Android version.<p>Secondly, a lot of coders who don&#x27;t also have some server-side Java experience find Eclipse jarringly unfriendly. Spend some time getting used to Eclipse and understand how the &quot;It&#x27;s plugins all the way down&quot; model makes Eclipse do some stupid things. Android Studio is much better, but it&#x27;s still an &quot;early access&quot; release.<p>Thirdly, Android&#x27;s runtime is a platform for apps and system middleware. Large parts of the Android system are written in Java using the same toolchain as apps. You can, for example, add an API to Android that other apps can use. You can communicate with lots of other apps. You can &quot;borrow&quot; parts of apps&#x27; UI and ask them to do particular tasks, like picking a file, for you, and you can let other apps do the same with your app. Android is more complex because it is more expressive.",1371166677

I researched this for work, and I couldn&#x27;t find anyone whom I <i>trusted</i> saying that was a good mitigation. The people I <i>trusted</i> merely observed that RC4 was not vulnerable, but never said you should switch to it. Only secondary sources ever suggested that. My conclusion was that there was a reason for the primary sources never suggesting that; in response to a theoretical break of the rest of SSL, the correct move was not to move to a solution that had much more practical attacks already known than what BEAST demonstrated. But now it&#x27;s even sillier; BEAST has been either entirely or almost entirely mitigated in browsers (there&#x27;s no <i>server</i>-side defense against BEAST, but there&#x27;s a client-side one you can use, and browsers now have it). As far as I can tell, RC4 should be abandoned and we should resume using stronger ciphers for SSL. Anyone still concerned about BEAST should update their browser.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/03/16/has-https-finally-been-cracked/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/03/16/has-https-finally...</a>",1371166483

The feudal arrangement was that lords contracted the land out to vassals, who then employed serfs to work it. Protection and convenience flowed down, and in return wealth flowed up.<p>Now the greatest economic resource is information, and controlling it gives you power. But producing information in a top-down manner is ineffective, so in return for protection and convenience, the serf-users of the internet age produce a wealth of information for their lords. The main difference in the power relationship seems to be that modern serf-users are free to choose their lords, leading to greater competition among rival lords, whereas feudal serfs were born into the service of a single vassal, who in turn served a single lord.",1371166255

The reason I bring this up is that it wouldn&#x27;t work very well if your parallelism was very fine-grained.<p>It&#x27;s an elegant abstraction but by no means is it unique. Haskell springs to mind as another language with a similarly elegant abstraction for parallelism.

Case in point: military personnel stationed abroad don&#x27;t have the internet connection available to phone home every time they want to play a game, so Valve introduces an offline mode - authorize once before you deploy and freely play on that machine without an internet connection.  Combine that with the fact that their DRM servers are pretty rock solid (I&#x27;m sure people have had problems with it but I&#x27;ve never encountered them in the years I&#x27;ve used steam) and the Gabe promise to unlock DRM if anything happens to Steam, and you get a lot of people comfortable trusting their game library to Steam.",1371166195

5877300,comment,5876066,5876066,5,0,biofox,,,"Graphical modelling is an incredibly powerful tool, and it saddens me that UML is not valued more by hackers. I suspect one of the reasons it&#x27;s not used, is that people simply don&#x27;t need it most of the time. When I started in software I was apathetic about UML, in fact I thought the whole thing was a bit silly. I used the occasional class diagram to communicate an idea, but I could never see the point of modelling. Most of the time I know what needs coding and have a good intuition for how to implement it; but with experience, that has changed.<p>Only twice in my life have I had anything close to a religious epiphany: 1) the first time I tried psychedelics, and 2) the time I finally &#x27;got&#x27; UML: I was faced with an enormously complex software project that was far beyond my level of experience and skill set, and I didn&#x27;t have the faintest clue where to start... it was the sort of project that makes you feel slightly terrified and incompetent. After several false starts, I realised I needed to try a different approach, so out of desperation I dug up an old college textbook on systems analysis and tried to design the entire system on paper away from the computer. I started with a use case diagram, then numerous class diagrams, then sequence diagrams, then activity diagrams. In a matter of hours, I&#x27;d nailed the ENTIRE project, without straining my brain the slightest. I was ecstatic! It felt like I&#x27;d just acquired a superhuman power or a secret black art -- I&#x27;d transcended the capabilities of mere mortals, into the realm of gods! In that moment, I saw the essence of UML, and it was power! As nerdy as it sounds, it was certainly one of the most profound and memorable experience I&#x27;ve had -- taking something I knew moderately well (UML), and seeing an aspect of it that I could never have anticipated, and using it to solve a problem that was completely beyond me.<p>Saying all that, I should qualify that I&#x27;m not a UML fundamentalist, nor do I think everything should be modelled. People often criticise over-abstraction and &quot;architecture astronauts&quot;, and rightfully so. There is an inherent danger to modelling, but if you&#x27;re an experienced coder (and more importantly the person who&#x27;s going to be implementing the designs, so as to stay grounded and realistic) then there&#x27;s immense power in abstracting away the code and the limitations that come with &quot;thinking in code&quot;. Under the right conditions, modelling enables you to see the essence of the problem and derive a well-structured solution. That, at least, is my opinion.<p>...and on the topic of Agile doing away with the need for modelling: the whole point of modelling is to enable fast iterations. It&#x27;s amazing how fast ideas can develop with just a whiteboard and some thinking space. Why waste time coding?",1371165672

Particularly the ones about buyback value.  We paid our customers about 60% of what we were going to sell the game for.  I&#x27;ve never understood how people can think that the game they spent $60 for is going to sell for anywhere near that after a year or two.<p>To use the example in here, a $5 buyback value game would sell for about $10 where I worked.  I don&#x27;t know about Gamestop&#x27;s percentages, but I imagine it would sell for closer to $15 there.<p>Moving on to Steam, my library is clogged full of shit I&#x27;d love to sell back or give to someone else.  I still, to this day, hate Steam.  It&#x27;s convenient, sure, but I still often shop at the alternative instant download providers and I&#x27;m not talking about Origin or Amazon.<p>Beyond that, and back to actual gripes about the XBone, the only thing that has my friends and I completely against it is the always on Kinect.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of having a device in my home that can be used to monitor everything I do or say at any time.

7724654,comment,7718066,7720297,1,0,mpweiher,,,"Sorry, that was a trick question:  in Smalltalk, the for-loop is just a block/higher order function applied to a collection, except that the collection is an Interval defined by its start, end and optional step that only generates its contents on-demand, for example when iterating:<p><pre><code>    (1 to: 10) do: [ :i | ... ].\n</code></pre>\nSo (1 to: 10) creates an Interval, and then `do:` iterates that Interval.  There&#x27;s a shortcut convenience `to:do:` in Number that allows you to avoid the brackets.<p>The point being that the dichotomy &quot;for-loop vs. higher order functions&quot; is a false one.  And usefully so, for example you can adjust methods in Interval to iterate in parallel (or you use a different kind of Interval) without having to touch the language or most iteration code.",1399701568

If this is correct, how could the merger allow either firm to raise the price?&quot;<p>I read an article on this the other day, can&#x27;t find it right now.  The objection is based on the merged company gaining too much power over (potentially competing) content providers, not over their own customers.  I think the gist of it was that Netflix (or any similar company that serves content requested by ISP customers) might be able to thwart &quot;extortion&quot; by individual smaller ISP&#x27;s, because if Netflix stood up to the ISP and ISP responded by cutting off Netflix service, Netflix would still be able to survive  and derive sufficient profit by serving the population of ISP&#x27;s in other areas.  If a single ISP serves too much area/population, however, Netflix&#x27;s negotiating power falls rapidly.  In Time Warner/Comcast case, the single merged company would control so much area that as a practical matter Netflix would have to do whatever they demanded, because Netflix would lose too much money if it tried to fight the extortion and lost ability to serve all Time Warner/Comcast customers.  (I believe crux of this argument depends on antitrust laws preventing individual ISP&#x27;s from acting in concert against Netflix, which laws would not apply against Time Warner/Comcast as single entity.)<p>So basically the argument is that the TimeWarner/Comcast merger would create a company that has too much power over its competitors, leveraging its function as last-mile ISP to gain unfair advantage over content providers it competes with in providing its own content.<p>I did find the article, and there&#x27;s a lot more to it than what I wrote in previous paragraphs:\n<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/6/5678080/voxsplaining-telecom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2014/5/6/5678080/voxsplaining-telecom</a>",1399700052

7724606,comment,7724100,7724386,1,0,andrewfong,,,"I&#x27;d also point out that not having to work has the potential to decrease expenditures quite a bit.<p>For starters, the post itself assumes that if you don&#x27;t have to work, transportation costs decrease quite a bit. Keep in mind that people who have a hard time finding work often travel farther to find work or hold down multiple part-time jobs instead of one full-time job, which increases transportation costs. If you&#x27;re living in the Bay Area and have to commute every day, e.g., San Jose to San Francisco, a Caltrain + MUNI monthly pass works out to an extra $300 / month in expenses that you wouldn&#x27;t have to spend if you weren&#x27;t working.<p>In addition, the fact that you don&#x27;t have to work gives you more flexibility in choosing where to live -- if you&#x27;re not concerned about employment, you can live where the cost of living was cheapest.<p>We&#x27;re also assuming that that basic income will always be guaranteed. One reason the federal minimum wage might be considered too low is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any income left over to save for unemployment, retirement, or other scenarios where your income source is lost. That becomes irrelevant if everyone gets a guaranteed income.<p>Finally, simply having an extra 8+ hours of free time each day makes it a lot easier to optimize your costs. You have more time to plan your meals, to research and compare prices on every kind of expenditure, to exercise and minimize long term health costs, etc.",1399699490

Perhaps a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the broadband customers who are not getting the service they paid for.<p>Of course, this is not without great difficulty.<p>I&#x27;d estimate that roughly 100% of US consumer broadband providers have written into their customer agreements clauses that a) provide no guarantee for any level of service and b) require customers to wave their right to file a lawsuit for any reason, class-action or otherwise. So, first these provisions would be challenged, and then the case could continue.<p>What is the outcome? Cynically, 10 years later, the broadband company settles out of court, admitting no wrong-doing and changing nothing in their business, and the lawyers get paid millions, the consumers sort of just plod on.<p>On a larger scale, I think the biggest mistake that we&#x27;ve made as a culture is that we no longer expect the government to be the final arbiter of justice. Indeed, the political winds on the matter of hated &quot;regulation&quot; shifts so frequently that regulators themselves must be a bunch of basket-cases.

You can use docker tags to build a separate image for each git commit/tag/branch.<p>* When ready to deploy, use &quot;docker push&quot; to upload your image to a registry (you can run your own, or use the official registry at <a href=""https://index.docker.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://index.docker.io</a>). Note the official registry supports private images.<p>* From your production machines (presumably CoreOS but you may have a mix of other distros too) run  &quot;docker pull&quot; and &quot;docker run&quot; to deploy your app.<p>* Use Links (&quot;docker rum --link&quot;) to interconnect containers, for example your frontend to your database, etc.<p>Mostly if you use Docker for development, you don&#x27;t need Vagrant.

I get what you are saying about the oath but it is administered by Federal court judges so it is apparently not in conflict with the Supreme Court ruling. Secondly it is not what the Supreme Court said that matters here. By asking the naturalized citizens to take the oath it is entirely reasonable that their native governments construe the action as renouncing their original citizenship. It is literally what the oath says. I get that with the Supreme Court ruling it is possible for American citizens to obtain another citizenship without losing their US citizenship. I think that is a good thing in this increasingly globalized world and hopefully one day national borders will mean a lot less as it is in Europe today. However we were discussing what you said: &quot;So becoming a Chinese citizen means renouncing your US citizenship.&quot; Does China actually enforce it by demanding proof or also just make you take an oath? I understand there may be little data to tell at this point. And when I said that US does the same I meant that the US make you take the oath to renounce your native citizenship.",1399698634

Pretend we have country A with a $10 GDP, 10 tons of CO2, and 10 people.
Country B also has a $10 GDP, 10 tons of CO2, but only 1 person.
Subby's numbers make Country B 10 times as efficient when really they're both the same per ton of CO2.",1345856390

4430577,comment,4429438,4429917,3,0,sushimako,,,"> Is this is a list of what is most likely the cheapest options? The options with the fastest setup? Lowest commitment?<p>Comparing server-hosting options (dedicated, own hw+colo, vps, cloud) merely by paid $$/month, dedicateds and owned hardware + colo-housing always wins (in my experience). You can get a HP DL120G7 w/ good cpu and 16gb ram, incl housing and a TB of traffic for ~ $300/month[0].
Last time i checked the prices for an aequivalent offering on amazon (and others) was way beyond that (excl traffic). 
A startup could easily boostrap with mentioned hardware. And you're the only one on that hardware, you're pretty much guaranteed the power that you're promised.<p>Now if you want more than one machine, you'd probably put some virtualization on your server. For that, you need someone on your team who is able to and can spend the time to setup some virtualization on your HN. And care about it. (Can be lot of work or very little, depending on how much time/effort was spent in the setup process). 
If you don't have that person on your team, you'd have to pay someone to do it. This can push the costs significantly, maybe beyond those of the virtual competition.<p>Another benefit of VPS/cloud is that you never have to care about the hardware running your boxes. A harddrive dies? Not your problem, and you probably wouldn't even notice. 
If you have your own hardware, you could protect against downtimes due to hardware failure by having critical server-parts redundant, e.g. hw/sw-raid, redundant power supply. If you put some service-contracts with the hardware-vendor or the datacenter, you can have your failed hardware hot-swapped by someone in a decent amount of time (depending on what sla you're willing to pay for).<p>Fast setup is usually better on vps/cloud providers. Having fast setup times with own hardware depends on you choice of datacenter/provider i'd guess. They might have pre-setup/cabled machines ready to be activated within short call. 
If you need some more power RIGHT NOW and you're running on dedicateds and for some reason it takes 2 days to get the new hw, that i'd probably spin up a cloud machine temporarily. Preferably a prepared image that's usually shutdown and taken up for such a scenario.<p>please mind, that comparing those soultions to heroku is a different story. Heroku offer way more service and take away most of the sysops headaches from you. 
Of course that's a little more pricey, but again: for any server-instance based solution (vps, cloud, dedicated) you need _someone_ setup your httpd and a deployment of you app.<p>So back to you're question ""What does this data tell us?"". The hosting diagram tells me personally, that choices were made based on not wanting to spending time/money on sysops and/or more trust in cloud/vps solutions.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.leaseweb.com/en/dedicated-servers/configurator-custom-built"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leaseweb.com/en/dedicated-servers/configurator-cu...</a>?",1345855183

4430561,comment,4429433,4429989,2,0,dalke,,,"There's ""unknown"" and there's ""unknown."" A 2009 paper (""HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT FOR ALUMINIUM, ALUMINIUM OXIDE, AND ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE"") states:<p>Aluminium hydroxide is one of the adjuvants most commonly used in routine human vaccines against hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis A virus, and tetanus toxoid (TT) and in veterinary vaccines (see also Effects on Humans, Effects from Non-Occupational Exposure, Irritation, Irritation after Injection of Aluminium-Adsorbed Proteins (Vaccines and Hyposensitization Regimens)). Although it has been investigated since 1926, the mechanisms of action of aluminium adjuvants are not yet fully understood. It is likely that aluminium adjuvants induce immune activation which includes interleukin (IL) -1 production by monocytes, induction of eosinophilia, compliment activation and increased specific and non-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgE antibody responses (Gupta & Siber, 1995; HogenEsch, 2002; Jensen & Koch, 1988; Larsen et al., 2002; Norimatsu et al., 1995; Shi et al., 2001). Limitations of aluminium adjuvants for human vaccination include local reactions, augmentation of IgE antibody responses, ineffectiveness against some antigens and inability to augment cell-mediated immune responses, especially cytotoxic T-cell responses (Gupta, 1998).<p>Now, on to the question of ""acceptable levels."" Elsewhere in the same paper:<p>Further, the administration of aluminium-containing vaccines for extended time periods was found to be associated with the development of [macrophagic myofasciitis] at the injection site. In the past, individuals with impaired renal function receiving dialysis were reported to be at greater risk for aluminium intoxication associated with contaminated replacement fluids. However, this incidence has diminished markedly in recent years with the use of non-contaminated fluid and replacement of high-dose antacid therapy with alternatives. Although infants and children may be at higher risk for toxicity due to aluminium, a causal relationship was not confirmed. Hence, it should be noted that only at excessive concentrations of aluminium are toxic manifestations seen in human sensitive subpopulations.<p>I interpret this as saying that the reason there are ""ZERO studies on acceptable levels of aluminum exposures"" (and I have not researched this enough to be definitive that there are ZERO) is because there's no need to expose children to a high enough level of aluminum in order to find the limit. There's no major effect seen at current Al levels, other than reactions by a small population which has a reaction to the metal, and there are many cases where infants and young animals have been tested, without seeing obvious effects.<p>Indeed, there <i>are</i> plenty of papers which compare the effects of vaccines with and without aluminum adjuvants, in infants. One such is <a href=""http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/184/9/1211.long"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/184/9/1211.long</a> . While <a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/17/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/17/</a> doesn't compare the two but observes that ""The 11-PncTD vaccine is safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic in infants.""<p>So if the existing level of aluminum has an effect on infants then it's subtle. Now, do you really want people to put more aluminum into the bloodstream of infants in order to find out what the acceptable level might be? Or can we say that as best as we can tell, the current levels aren't a problem, and leave it at that?",1345854914

Executives and capitalism could claim that <i>they</i> were the real producers and movers of progress and that the workers, ""mere"" adders. were hangers-on (Randism) but that's no longer the case. Now software engineers can be multipliers without access to capital or bureaucratic installation into a managerial role.<p>Global economic growth is currently about 4% per year. That's the highest it's ever been, but there's no reason it can't be much higher-- possibly 20 or 30 percent per year. That seems radical, but in 1798 (Malthus) economic growth under 1%, and that (sub-1% global economic growth) had been the norm for eternity. Malthus was wrong mathematically in his assumption that economic growth was linear (even in pre-industrial times, the curve was exponential-- just a very slow exponential curve) but he was right about population increases outpacing economic growth and leading to disaster or war. That happened constantly in pre-industrial societies. It stopped happening in the developed world around 1850.

In the end its like playing Starcraft.  It does not lead to any output.  Just firing of neurons within their brains.",1345853949

(there was also more at the time, but I can't recall specifics now).<p>> If we had patents on desktop GUI user input standards like right click, ctrl key modifiers like ctrl-scroll to zoom, etc. then using computers would be a much bigger PITA.<p>This is the key right here. I don't think everyone fully understands what is happening around these UI patents in the rush to defend someone's ""inventions"" in the face of would-be-counterfeiters.<p>One of the most important aspects of patents is that they do not account for independent invention. Leave Apple out of your mind for a minute. Imagine your startup is developing a web or mobile app, and you come up with a nice way of presenting some kind of responsive UI that's well tailored to the data your app displays. It follows naturally from your data model, you end up with some really nice UX, and you get some internet buzz because it's a distinguishing feature of your app (see: pull to refresh, et al).<p><i>You will be liable</i> if some company filed a patent for that idea 10 years ago, even if you've never heard of them or their product.<p>What's particularly insidious about these patents is that there's no real mechanism described here, like you'd have to provide for a mechanical device. Instead, you can get away with describing a ""computing device"" that ""receives user input"" and acts on it it in a fairly generic way, and suddenly you have a patent on not an invention, but a whole class of interaction or a generic human movement paired with a particular action on screen.<p>And you won't know you've infringed until you're sued!<p>Copyright and trademark have these well covered. They allow for independent invention and are much more specific to a particular expression of an idea. Regardless of copying and just deserts, regardless of the fact that this wasn't going to be settled in this case, no one here should be cheering the current standard for acceptable software patents.",1345853423

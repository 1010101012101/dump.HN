Unfortunately Disney pushed for extension of copyrights every time their key copyrights (Micky mouse & friends) were about to expire and have been able to push extending them quite unreasonably.

Cold calls in that industry are very difficult...<p>I don't want them to take my word for it, just supply me with  more test data and I could send them my results.",1195033816
79704,comment,79543,79702,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I share the concern about security through obscurity.   But this isn't intended to be obscure (it's not like I change the port to 12222 and hope no one finds it).   It's a technique like port knocking which relies on the algorithm being totally open but the underlying hash being unpredictable.  All the security here comes from the passphrase + hashing combination which is designed to make the actual port difficult to determine.<p>John

79702,comment,79543,79672,0,0,corentin,,,"From a purely technical point of view, I agree that it's more secure.
But from a psychological point of view, isn't this system somewhat similar to security through obscurity? That is, isn't it an incentive to not care about the rest (keeping the software up to date, monitoring the logs, etc.) because you now think that your SSH server is in a safe place, out of reach? Because, now, you may tend to think that nobody will seriously attack it (whereas you just filtered out the harmless, mass-scanning attackers).<p>I know you wrote ""Of course, this doesn't replace making sure that the SSH server is up to date [...]"" at the end of the article; but, well, most programmers will also tell you ""you must document and test your software, brush your teeth three times a day, etc."" :)",1195032479
79701,comment,78498,78908,0,0,neilc,,,"> I think by worked he means setting the standards and being the platform and eliminating any competition<p>Well, I suppose if you redefine ""worked"" to mean whatever you like, then it's hard to prove the guy wrong. But a platform that ""worked"" is not generally considered equivalent to ""eliminating any competition"".",1195032269

It then would become something of a medusa head though, because if you hope to get any regular work done you'll have to completely divert your eyes.",1195031048

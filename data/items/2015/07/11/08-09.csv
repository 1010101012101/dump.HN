9869114,comment,9867465,9868915,0,0,igravious,,,"Wonderfully accessible synopsis. One ever so _minor_ point. Did you really mean to say &quot;The former and the latter are not the same thing&quot; or &quot;The former and the latter are not _formally_ the same thing&quot; ???<p>Here&#x27;s a fun fact for you, you might enjoy this. I picked up a copy of a 1943, second edition, hardback copy of Bertrand Russell&#x27;s <i>An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth</i>. (In an antiquarian bookstore for €25, as one does... the colophon even states BOOK PRODUCTION WAR ECONOMY STANDARD)<p>Anyway, chapter XX is titled &quot;The Law of The Excluded Middle&quot; and in it Russell states, &quot;[…] As everyone knows, Brouwer has challenged the law, and has done so on epistemological grounds. He, in common with many others, holds that “truth” can only be defined in terms of “verifiability”, which is obviously a concept belonging to the theory of knowledge. If he is right, it follows that the law of the excluded middle, and the law of contradiction also, belong to epistemology, and must be reconsidered in the light of whatever definition of truth and falsehood epistemology permits.&quot;<p>What strikes me about this (apart from the fact that I did not know previously that Russell tackled the question of constructivism/intuitionism so directly) is that he claims that everyone! knows this. If we are being charitable by everyone he means mathematicians, and perhaps logicians, maybe even philosophers, I still think it&#x27;s quite a broad statement. It shows that the school of the logical positivists springs from Brouwer -- which firstly I was never taught, and which secondly does not appear in, for instance, <i>Language, Truth, and Logic</i>[1] by A.J. Ayer. Finally I can see how the law of double negation becomes an epistemological matter, but not the law of what he calls here contradiction (noncontradiction?).<p>He goes on to disprove the verifiability claim over many pages, and thus constructivism. There&#x27;s a swipe at Wittgenstein further on still. It&#x27;s a fascinating text. Russell grapples with mathematical and logical issues in a clear fashion using everyday language. Kind of like what you might get if you took the intro to HoTT and lengthened it and made it more philosophical.<p>[1] <a href=""https://archive.org/stream/AlfredAyer/LanguageTruthAndLogic_djvu.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/AlfredAyer/LanguageTruthAndLogic_...</a><p>ps: is there markup for blockquote on HN?<p>EDIT: clarity, markup, prose style",1436604985

We&#x27;re aren&#x27;t talking about just changing light bulbs, most people I know did that years ago. All the easy stuff was done years ago, it&#x27;s trying to eliminate standby power consumption, turning of the oven early cooking on the residual heat, buying a new fridge and so on. Expensive and cumbersome things. Sure people want to help the environment, but it would be more motivating if all your investments and vigilance was reflected on your electric bill.<p>A typical Danish electric bill is:\n10% transport, paying for the grid.\n45% electric tax (Just a tax, not really clear what it&#x27;s for).\n20% sales tax\n10% PSO tax, for securing electrical supply, support for green energy production and research.\n15% Actual energy usage.<p>I&#x27;m concerned that people will stop trying to save energy, if it&#x27;s not reflected on their bill.

9869098,comment,9867465,9868873,0,0,IngoBlechschmid,,,"Your comment is a good first approximation to the motivation for HoTT! However, let me add a couple of remarks.<p>Firstly, HoTT can also be used with classical logic, i.e. where you freely use the law of excluded middle. This does not impact the ability to check proofs with the computer in any way.<p>Secondly, HoTT is the first foundation with which computer-formalized proofs of nontrivial theorems in a subject called &quot;homotopy theory&quot; are possible. In theory, this is possible with any foundational theory; but in practice, the necessary encodings to, for instance, Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory, are too involved for computer formalization.<p>In HoTT, one can define (and reason about) the basic concepts of homotopy theory straight from &quot;day one&quot;. In contrast, with a more traditional foundation, one needs to setup a host of intermediate concepts first (like the real numbers, topological spaces, homotopies, ...). This is no problem for a trained mathematician, but becomes a nuisance when working with proof assistants.<p>Thirdly, one intriguing aspect of HoTT is that it might be possible to &quot;run&quot; proofs (this is the objective of current research). For example, if you prove that some group contains finitely many elements, the vision is that you could run this proof to find out how many elements it contains. This &quot;computational interpretation&quot; is not unique to HoTT; in fact, this is what the linked nLab article is about. But because of the second point, many more theorems are amenable to such an approach.<p>A last remark, not pertaining to HoTT but constructive mathematics. A simple reason why one might be interested in restricting oneself to constructive arguments is that thereby they are applicable to more general situations. There is a metatheorem to the effect that &quot;a statement with a constructive proof holds in any topos&quot;, where &quot;topos&quot; is a precise formulation of &quot;alternative mathematical universe&quot;. Such universes are routinely used in several subjects of mathematics, for instance algebraic geometry (after Grothendieck&#x27;s revolution).<p>There are also other reasons for why it&#x27;s fun to argue constructively. See for instance these slides: <a href=""https://github.com/iblech/talk-constructive-mathematics/raw/master/negneg-translation-notes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/iblech/talk-constructive-mathematics/raw/...</a> (PDF pages 8ff.)",1436604418

9869068,comment,9868908,9868998,0,0,vhffm,,,"I&#x27;d like to point out that space is an extremely large and harsh environment. The three main issues:<p>1) Distances are huge. Light needs ~5 hours to travel from Pluto to Earth. This means high-gain (=large), directional antennas, and low data-rates to make sure you actually receive the same data that the craft transmits to you (and vice versa).<p>2) Electronics need to be shielded from radiation and cosmic rays. On Earth, the atmosphere does a this for us (and we still get hit by cosmic rays, leading to things like randomly flipped bits). If you have a space-craft that cannot be directly controlled from Earth (because, 5 hours one-way communication time), you need it to be somewhat autonomous. Random bit-flips can spell disaster, so you need to either bring a ton of shielding, redundant  (and well-tested, aka &quot;outdated&quot;) systems, or both.<p>3) All these things add mass to your vehicle. Mass is the single largest cost driver in launch operations.<p>In summary, space is difficult and expensive to get to and operate in. This costs money.

To relieve you of the responsibility of hearing what you might have to hear?&quot;<p>Typically this job falls to the public prosecutors. Who <i>will</i> make mistakes, misapply and pervert the laws. Sometimes with good intentions, sometimes with malice.<p>It is not just an abstract argument, it has very real consequences. Here in Finland we had a case [1] where an MP (now MEP) was convicted of hate speech for making a point about freedom of speech by asking a question along the lines of: &#x27;Why is it ok to write that Finns might be culturally and genetically predisposed to get drunk and kill people, but not ok to write that Somalis might be culturally and genetically predisposed to rob people and live on welfare?&#x27;<p>These types of laws have very real chilling effects on public discourse. People are unwilling to engage in certain topics, which <i>should</i> be discussed, due to the fear of being prosecuted. In democracies trying to suppress or censor an idea or argument will just end up elevating them. In this case, the party to which the convicted MP belongs ended up becoming the second largest party and are now in the government. They no longer have to argue their case, they can simply implement it (and their immigration program was written by the MP in question).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Halla-aho#Criminal_charges_and_conviction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Halla-aho#Criminal_charg...</a>",1436602989

Invention happened throughout history, but the context has to be there for the invention to be applied, the inventor to be free to invent and rewarded for doing so, and the flow of information to occur so other inventors can build on top of their work.<p>Case in point, no single individual invented the steam engine, it was a process that involved dozens of people across decades before a truly useful steam engine resulted, and the only reason those people could contribute is because of a society which didn&#x27;t claim inventions as toys for a palace or required then to work all day every day as a farmer. See for example the difference between north and south Korea, same people, same starting point, different society and government, radically different outcome.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile</a>",1436602195

There are some directly affected climate processes. For example, if you cover a big area with solar panels, the ground does not get heat up, which can have an effect in water reservoirs or whatever.<p>So, <i>this is happening</i> when we use renewable resources. I assume we can agree on this.<p>But there are a couple of caveats:<p>- probably the scale at which we are <i>currently</i> affecting the environment with renewable energy sources is reaaally small, specially compared to the effect that non-renewable energy sources have. But anyway, exponential growth based on renewable energy sources will at some point start having a big effect on climate too. This is probably very far way, and we can probably compensate for this somehow (<i>terraforming</i> Earth, so to say). As long as we are using up a small fraction of the sun energy, we have room for maneuver. An even then, nuclear energy can help further, so the ultimate limit is the amount of matter we have at our disposal.<p>- it is difficult to say how Earth adjusts to this tampering: is it able to dissipate the heat produced by human processes (not talking about CO2 here)? Is it able to absorb more sun radiation, since the &quot;equilibrium situation&quot; has been affected? I mean, if we &quot;slow down the wind&quot; with a wind-turbine, maybe there is a new complementary process which takes care of putting sun energy in the wind again.",1436601960

The first version of the most noteworthy innovations are often the result of a single person&#x27;s effort. But it&#x27;s also evident big projects are the results of teams. You can&#x27;t produce something big without a team.<p>So what makes me uncomfortable is that I don&#x27;t see one of the inventors of Go having produced a rough version one before pulling other people in (but to be fair, I simply don&#x27;t know).<p>I&#x27;m more suspicious about the first Go program. Was computing a prime sieve the number one problem the Go creators had? Doubtful. When C was being written, the authors were also writing an application they deeply needed: UNIX.<p>Finally, the thought of making something &quot;serious&quot; spoils the general hack flavor of innovative solutions. It&#x27;s like a beacon that ideas are about to start being policed, which sounds like the opposite effect consensus intends to produce. It may be a good idea to keep a project non-serious as long as possible instead of optimizing it prematurely.",1436601877

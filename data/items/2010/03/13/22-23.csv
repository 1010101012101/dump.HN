There is very little chance (for this exact reason) that HTC's or Google's engineers read Apple's patents. And yet, they implemented something that Apple considered similar enough to sue over. Outside of a very special cases (like encryption algorithms), it seems that nearly all software patent infringement is accidental, the result of people trying to solve the same problem and happening to run into the same solution.

In America, you can agree to a well-defined contract and enforce it in court. Sometimes a buyer shouldn't pay for work completed. If you are dealing with a foreign contractor, neither party has legal protections, the buyer has a lot of leverage and more money, and as such should treat the contractor extremely fairly.",1268518473

An individual isn't big enough to mass produce products or protect them or market them more than the big corps, but the individual can sell the patent or get investors to help him/her fight infringement.<p>Why is that your big concern?

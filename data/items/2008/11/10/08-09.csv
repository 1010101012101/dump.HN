Depending on the individual it manifests differently, in my case it presents as a natural tendency to go to sleep each night about two hours later than the night before (8:00 PM -> 10:00 PM -> 12:00 PM) sleeping for 8.5-9 hours.<p>I've been this way since infancy.  In high school it was difficult, in college it was manageable, while working it was unbearable.<p>Five months ago I left my first job of out college.<p>I had interned for the previous two summers and was essentially told by HR that I was obligated to comeback full-time.  More than that, I wanted to comeback.  Up until that point I had an extremely flexible schedule.  As an intern I had a loose schedule, typically working more than 40 hours each week, and they were happy enough with me to offer a full-time position.<p>All of my life I was terrified that my sleep was going to make consistent employment impossible.  I was thrilled to have found a job that paid extremely well and allowed for a flexible schedule.  My confidence soared.  In the three years since first interning I've contributed over 30 KLOC to various open source projects, traveled, and generally lived without fear.<p>When I started full-time, everything changed.<p>For the first three months it wasn't terrible.  I would usually arrive between 6:00 AM and 10:00 AM, netting between 4-5 hours of sleep on a typical week night.  After the first three months I was exhausted.  I talked to the President, telling him that I was exhausted and that I needed a change.  I was largely ignored.  I would take sick days to catch up on sleep.<p>Six months of this and I was out of my head tired and my performance was slipping.  On Friday / Saturday nights I would sleep 12-16 hours and go to the office or work from home during the weekends just to keep up.  People started to call me a zombie.  I stopped reading, visiting family and friends, and watching tv or movies.  I would go home after work each night and just wait for sleep.  I stopped existing.<p>I requested two weeks of unpaid leave, and essentially slept through the first six days.  After that I tried to catch up on some open source work.  By the end of the two weeks I was wracked with anxiety, terrified to go back to the way things were, but, I did.<p>The president asked me to see a doctor, and I scheduled an appointment for after the holidays.  6.5 months in, our daily developer meeting was moved to 8:45 AM (from 1:00 PM) and arrival time / meeting attendance was now  being monitored.  I actually started getting less sleep that I was before, 3-5 hours a night.<p>I offered to quit, twice.  Three months into employment, and about seven months in.  If thing weren't going to change I was eager to leave.  I stayed because I earnestly believed that they were going to work with me.  The president actually said to me:  ""You have a number of years ahead of you, let's find out if there's something wrong.""  This statement more than any other made what came next seem like a cruel jape.<p>Now seven months into my little experiment with prolonged partial sleep deprivation I had my results back from my sleep doctor.  I was diagnosed with delayed sleep phase syndrome.  A polysomnogram (PSG) was performed and no easily correctible physical reason was found for my sleep condition (restless legs, sleep apnea, etc.)  Sleeping pills were largely ineffective.<p>The next week I had a series of conversations with my direct report and the president of the company.  Giving them the results of my PSG, and the diagnosis I requested a schedule change, any schedule change.<p>I was asked:  ""What would happen if we don't change your schedule?""<p>I replied that: ""I would have to quit.""<p>Sometime later my direct report came back to my office and said:  ""We're not going to fire you, as long as you come in on time, as you have been doing.  But, we will not be changing your schedule.""<p>I had a lease for another three months and my girlfriend of 8 years (seriously, we had been together since we were 16) had just left me because I was exhausted and working all of the time.<p>I asked for some time to think about it, eventually telling them that I would have to quit, but, that I would give them my notice two weeks before my lease was up.<p>I asked if I could have a schedule change to make the next three months a bit easier.  The request was denied.<p>I spent the next three months exhausted and in a state of shock.<p>About three weeks before I was scheduled to quit, my direct report actually asked for my notice.  While giving my notice I practically begged for my job.  I, again, asked for any kind of schedule change of any kind. Even offering to move to a part-time position.<p>I was exhausted and afraid for my job every single day for a year.  Ostensibly, this was a fun place to work, video games, snacks, etc.  I just couldn't enjoy it on so little sleep<p>I've spent the last five months living with family and have now decided to reenter academia terrified by the though of living through this again.  I'm actually afraid to get another job.<p>TL;DR Version:<p>Does anyone else here have a sleep condition?  \nHow do you deal with it?  \nHow do you live?\nWhere do you work?\nAny advice?<p>I know nothing about contracting, or how to go about starting my own company, but, I see these as my only options.",1226307427

It the worst e-commerce experience I can recall.<p>Let me share a few things I experienced:<p>Their commerce partner charged me twice.  I was able to catch this as they sent me two charge confirmation emails.  I decided it wasn't worth my time to collect a double charge for $20.<p>The check out process automatically added an extra up-sell item to my final check out and if I wasn't being careful enough to remove the item, I would have paid more.  They also added state tax to what was a download only order.  I don't see that too often.  I had to put in a U.S. address to match my credit card, but I didn't buy from the U.S., I made the purchase from Shanghai.<p>After I purchased, they sent me a download instructions.  This email directs me to create an account at their site and follow more instructions which ends up letting you download a file in Stuff-it format.  The stuff-it file is 91.1 MB.  After you download, you have to go register with Smith Micro to download their free version of Stuff-it.  But there's a catch.  You have to give them your email to download the free extractor and it isn't easy to figure out how to get the free version as they try to sell you the deluxe version.  Now I regularly get spam from Smith Micro.<p>So once your done and you extract the Mavis Beacon program from the 91.1 MB stuff-it file, you end up with a 92.3M app directory. Not too much compression going on here.<p>And in the end, all I can say is, this program is ancient.",1226307251

Someone who threatens your life has removed themself from any concept of morality, like any other person initiating force against anyone else.<p>""What about kill 10 people to keep yourself alive?""<p>If they're ten gangsters trying to rob or rape or kill you, see the above.  If they're ten random people that some madman ordered you to murder for his own reasons, at the cost of your own life if you do not, then morality cannot apply here.  There can be no right and wrong in the case of someone who is acting under coercion.<p>""What about killing someone who is not harming you, in order to keep yourself alive?""<p>Assuming no madman scenario, so no coercion (which would make it the same as the above), no.  Not for organs for transplant, nor for money to pay rent, nor for two dollars for a loaf of bread.  A person does not gain the right to use force against others to get what they need to live by their inability to get it by other means.<p>""What about kill a baby to save 100 people?""<p>I can't see any way this would apply outside of the madman scenario I answered above.<p>All of these answers are based on my understanding of morality, which is derived from first principles, as you put it.  I'm not so bored as to write about it in detail, and besides, the works of Ayn Rand provide a good first approximation to it.  (Read the part of Atlas Shrugged nobody actually reads [in before ""You mean any of it?""] -- John Galt's radio speech -- and you'll get a good idea.

359025,comment,358284,358930,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"C++ makes programming slow in many ways. You have to specifiy (and and maintain) every function signature twice. Compile times are measured in minutes for any substantial code base, unless you spend considerable time decoupling layers of headers, which slows programming down even more. Finding bugs is much more difficult without a stack trace, etc.<p>I'm not saying C++ shouldn't be used because if it really adds to the quality of the result the additional effort may be worth it. It's a balance between the quality of the product and time to market.<p>There's one more issue that shouldn't actually play a role but does: I have rarely seen C++ code that isn't full of incredibly stupid errors like copying large collections three times in a single function call. Even smart professional programmers very often write C++ code that is complete crap and way slower than the most naive C# or Java implementation.<p>But as someone who writes very data intensive apps I have to say there's just no way around C/C++. C# and Java VMs have twice the memory consumption of C/C++. I don't know whether C code uses more memory than assembly, but I doubt that a factor of two will ever be negligible, particularly because it translates into a factor of 100 as soon as you run out of memory and have to hit the disk.<p>Unfortunately the combination of C/C++ and dynamic languages doesn't work for many of my own scenarios because of the GIL.<p>I mean look Rails (just as an example). A typical rails app runs in 16 processes, each consuming 150MB of RAM (after a while of running) just for the framework itself and a few controllers and views basically. Nothing but little helpers doing CRUD.<p>There's just no memory left to do anything interesting with data in-memory because all that data would have to be duplicated in each process. That's why dynamic languages driving a C++ core doesn't really fly for interactive apps. It works for batch processes like what google does.",1226305375

359016,comment,358580,358953,0,0,kaens,,,"By ""common morality"", I did not mean a base set of ""this is right, this is wrong"" absolutes. I meant that in all existing moral codes, the base parts of them are derived from the concept of consent.<p>Your ""simplest"" example is a can of worms that I don't even want to try to open. The answer to that depends on whether or not you consider a fetus to be human, or at what stage you do.<p>In most cases such as your examples, there are no ""moral"" choices by my definition. Ending the life of another, thinking, capable of consent persons life is never a moral action. It may be the ""best"" choice, or it may be the choice that leads to the least breaking of the ""consent"" rule, but that does not make it moral - consent is still being broken.<p>As a general rule, I would think that if someone has taken actions that imply that they do not care about the consent-based groundings of morality, then they should be treated as if those rules do not apply to them. That does not mean that breaking those rules for that person is <i>moral</i>, but that it shouldn't weigh heavily on ones conscience.<p>My argument is mainly that the varying moral codes are <i>based</i> on the idea that non-consensual action should be avoided. There are very few, if any, cultures that consider cold-blooded murder to not be immoral - or rape, or thievery, etc. This makes sense in the context of group survival.<p>EDIT: Also, assuming you're responding in part to my assertion that ""one can very easily come to logical conclusions about how one should act towards other humans in the absence of a higher power"", I do not see how the existence of logical conundrums counter that. For the vast majority of human interactions, the vast majority of people will arrive at the conclusion that it is best overall to follow the ""golden rule"" - which is more or less an alternate expression of ""don't break others consent"" - through the process of critical analysis - edge cases do not change that.",1226304443

And while I don't completely agree with this article, I do think that a system that treats adolescents like adults would be an improvement.<p>Not one that makes them work and leave school, mind you. Just one that respects them aging. A part of me feels that if we let teachers swear in front of students, let them act like people than act completely neutral, and start teaching them about how to solve their own problems, we'd find that a lot of the problems in modern society would just vanish.<p>Every instance in my life that I've felt like rebelling against a system was an instance in my life when I was treated like an adolescent per se. And that happened very rarely: I was lucky enough to have teachers that usually took the time to treat me like an adult. Whenever I see a student in college getting violently drunk and acting like an ass, I would place money on that person originating by acting against some authority figure. (Indeed, I have friends whose families let them drink, and none of those kids are alcoholic whatsoever. I wouldn't call it a formal study, but I think trends say that kids get into stuff like that when they associate that with being grown up.)",1226304267

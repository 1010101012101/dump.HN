But, light can never <i>be</i> at rest.<p>Light does however, have <i>momentum</i>. And when it is reflected/refracted, it will transfer some of that momentum to whatever it hit.<p>Also remember that forces act on <i>pairs</i> of things. Light can be deflected by gravity (which will change it&#x27;s momentum); therefore it must produce a gravitational field (which will in return change the momentum of whatever deflected it). And of course gravity is proportional to mass.<p>Light which is moving towards and object will gain momentum, like a falling rock would. Only instead of moving faster (since it&#x27;s at a fixed speed), it shifts towards higher frequencies. If you look at the equations slightly differently, you get gravitational time dilation.",1408539534

8202085,comment,8201362,8201362,24,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"In recent versions of MC, you can do a much better delay line memory with comparators. You can actually end up being able to store 2b / block (2 and not 4 because comparators have to be placed on something not a comparator.) - it would be half that but there&#x27;s a trick you can play to avoid requiring redstone dust between comparators.<p>The delay is faster too - 1 redstone tick / 4 bits, or 40 bits/sec per line, as opposed to this implementation&#x27;s 1 bit / 8 redstone ticks / line, or 1.25 bits / sec / line. (Note that this implementation of piston tape is decidedly suboptimal: the maximum is actually 3 bits / 4 redstone ticks / line = 7.5 bits/sec/line, as you can actually check for 8 different block types (glass / solid / sticky/non-sticky piston facing 3 directions) and you can make a faster-resetting piston loop.)<p>The biggest issue with comparator delay-line memory is that there&#x27;s no way of pausing it.<p>There&#x27;s also a way of storing arbitrary amounts of data per block, and that&#x27;s to use the fact that items with NBT data will stack only when their NBT data is identical. The easiest way to see this is to try to stack renamed items, but there are others. You can make a hopper or dropper chain and encode data in which line which enchanted item is in.<p>I have yet to see a practical implementation of the above, though.",1408538913

Cosmologists talk about the universe expanding faster than light during the inflationary phase, which sounds confusing because we&#x27;re told nothing can move faster than light.  While it is true that the speed of light must propogate at only one velocity for all freely moving frames of reference, the speed at which space itself expands can be anything!  Relativity does not restrict the speed at which space itself expands or contracts.    TL;DR The maximum local speed of anything moving through space in a freely moving frame of reference is c.  The speed at which space itself expands or contracts is not limited in any way by Einstein&#x27;s theory and is consistent with observations of the the inflationary universe in which the universe expanded at faster than the speed of light.",1408538729

For websites that have a lot of dynamic content I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a must - too much JQuery for AJAX and DOM manipulation may indicate that.<p>On the other hand, if the app is very simple and has got just a little dynamic content, there&#x27;s no need for SPA approach. For example, an admin panel for cloud like DigitalOcean or my project (<a href=""https://demo.virtkick.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://demo.virtkick.io/</a>) are good enough with server-side views.<p>Also, if the app needs to be super-fast, especially on mobiles, then server-side generated views are rather prefered. However, Twitter serves server-side generated views for first page load, and then does the rest like a SPA. While not possible with AngularJS (yet), you can do that by building your own stack on top of Express.js - just render the templates with JADE on server-side or client-side.

It can&#x27;t go faster, nor slower.  So how does the speed of light appear to slow down in certain circumstances?  In a vacuum, the speed of light is always c.  There is nothing to interfere with the propogation of the individual photons (little atoms of light) as they move through the vacuum.  However, in a material such as glass the individual photons of light are absorbed and reemitted many trillions of times by the molecules making up the glass.  The photons do a &quot;stop over&quot; and don&#x27;t move at all, the velocity of these photons is zero (actually the photons temporarily don&#x27;t exist except as energy absorbed by the atoms in the glass).  Between lattice points or individual atoms the photons travel at velocity c.  The combination of stop overs (absorbtion and reemission events) and free propogation gives the appearance light is travelling at a slower overall velocity than c.",1408538135

At the time of writing, the fastest supercomputer in the world as measured by the Top500 benchmark had over 1 PB of DRAM, and would require over 50 bits of address space if all the DRAM resided in a single address space. Some warehouse-scale computers already contain even larger quantities of DRAM, and new dense solid-state non-volatile memories and fast interconnect technologies\nmight drive a demand for even larger memory spaces. Exascale systems research is targeting 100 PB memory systems, which occupy 57 bits of address space.

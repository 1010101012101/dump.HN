However, the way it works is that taxes come from everybody and get funneled into very specific venues, which you don't need to pay for in particular. So as a child, you don't pay to go to school, and your parents pay taxes, but they don't pay for school in general.<p>However, the government organizes those schools, for better or for worse, and so my point is that it's within the government's rights to set up a system like the one Obama's proposing, so long as the system exists only for public schools.",1226100913

I've always been pretty good at making sure I'm happy and productive with my work AND learning stuff. Each of those ingredients is important - I think that even if only one is not there to your satisfaction, you should think about moving on. But moving on is not something that should be taken lightly. Because you're going to have lots of really tough times in a startup. Full of doubt and angst. And I mean really.

357222,comment,356940,356940,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The whole idea of basing education on age is ridiculous to begin with.<p>Kids should be able to advance once they demonstrate they have the knowledge to advance. Each level should have an optional test that allows one to advance to the next level, and that test should be available whenever the pupil wants to take it. Combine their performance on the test with observations from teachers of class performance and move the pupil up accordingly.<p>If this results in some precocious seven year-old graduating, more power to her.<p>Being 16 doesn't mean you have a 10th grade level of knowledge any more than being 40 means you are responsible. Everyone is different.<p>The same problems can be found in undergrad education. Degrees are earned by putting in four years. Why are all degrees four years long? Do all fields have exactly four years worth of knowledge to impart? Degrees should be based on demonstrable knowledge of the subject, however long (or short) that takes.",1226100022

357218,comment,357203,357203,0,0,qhoxie,,,"To me these both address the same issue.  I have heard a lot of different takes on this situation, and I myself have dealt with it.<p>1)  You should both get 50%.  This is just my opinion, but it applies well to most scenarios.  Having an unequal allotment causes lots of motivational and mentality issues for founders.  This is the last thing a venture needs in the turbulent early stages.  It generally leads to better dedication and like minded decisions between to two people.<p>A positive way to look at it would be this:  by giving up, say 10% more than you wanted to, the company has a better shot at success through two absolutely driven founders.<p>2)  This draws from the same motivation as the first.  Cofounders lose value quickly if one person always has the final word.  You want them there to even things out.  Disagreements are to be expected and the process of compromise is what makes the best decisions in many cases.  Two minds working toward the same goal are usually helpful, even if they are not always striking a chord.",1226099631

It seems like a catch 22 to me.<p>There are many successful people who grew up poor, uneducated, and even in violent family situations, but are now successful. They may have even had a ""low skilled service job"" at one point. It's good we have people to work those jobs - we need them, and it appears to be no serious impediment to true ambition and skill.<p><i>Likewise, it would have been bad for the likes of Steve Wozniak to have lived his life as a cubicle-dwelling random engineer, rather than to have blessed the world with his bigger ideas.</i><p>Without Steve Jobs' endless gusto and encouragement, that might have happened.

It sounds to me, too, that they are thinking of changing fundamentals in the language/system.  This could lead to something like the Python2vs3 scenario for a while.  If you base on current Scala, you might (likely) later find yourself doing either a re-write, or being relegated to a &quot;compatibility&quot; library.  You&#x27;re wise to ask.",1410029984

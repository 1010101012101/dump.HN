I can think of a few, and in all but one case, their ""conversion"" is rather suspect.  Or ""horrendous"" means some form of not-so-violent larceny (e.g. about as far as brandishing a weapon to intimidate) -- not rape or violent assault.<p>One uncomfortable thing you have to face in life is that some people are worth significantly less than others.

(b) the video he found of pincus telling developers that he had scammed in the beginning was HUGE. forced facebook to force zynga to kill this entire lead-gen industry (or at least severely modify it). and that, truly, is the benefit of online journalism. a single journalist at a desk assigned to a single story can't find those videos. you need the power of hundreds of people reading articles and collaborating (some dude probably thought to himself -- hmm, wait a second, i remember i was at that startup talk a couple of years ago...).<p>on the other hand, the developers, whom fake steve jobs calls scammy or something -- i don't really think they quite realized the extent of what was going on. it doesn't shirk their responsibility to see better. but, now we know. and boy, mainstream media was completely out of the loop of this entire change in the tech industry. so let's blame them. jk, but the long-term and short-term benefits of reporting w/ and w/o serious editors is going to be a bigger and bigger issue.'",1257721036

In fact, I gave that statement its own paragraph.<p>I don't know what the $50k you're talking about has to do with anything. As you know, <i>people</i> don't get $50k investments; corporations do. An ownership stake in an S-Corp that takes in $50k doesn't mean you have $50k in income, or even $25k. Talk to your accountant if you need help with the K-1 details here.<p>The idea that you'd have to spend that $50k on health insurance before servers is nonsensical. Companies with less than $500,000 in payroll aren't required to do <i>anything</i> vis a vis health insurance. The $50k is sitting in the ING account of an S-Corp. In a pre-revenue, pre-cash-flow-positive startup, it has nothing to do with your individual income until the S-Corp does a distribution.<p>I'm being maximally generous to your argument here, because the reality is that three ramen-eating startup founders would owe a <i>negligible</i> amount of fines for simply not buying insurance under this scheme.",1257720716

That's the ""authentication gap"" being talked about in the reports.<p>What's also true is that there are lots of protocols, many of them very obscure, that either rely on client auth, or that may themselves have an app-layer notion of multiple sessions which will conflict with TLS's session renegotiation.<p>I'm not going to eat my hat or anything if this happens, but I'd bet againt someone finding a plausible MITM attack that beats server certificates using this attack.

My question is about people who are either not in business or who have just signed papers of incorporation.  Perhaps they are just working under a memorandum of understanding. As I understand it, these folks are responsible for their own health insurance and are required to purchase it assuming they are able. If an Angel provides them with 100K for business development does that count as income? Do they then have to purchase insurance for themselves? For those guys, supposedly concentrating on finding a market and servicing it, are you saying there is a grant application process? Some forms to fill out? What, if anything, do they need to do that they are not doing now? Because there's obviously going to be something new for them to do, or they wouldn't have health care at all, right?",1257718488

Article drafts that&#x27;ll get published soon anyway.<p>That leave you with the much simpler task of securing communication of any details that needs to be kept safe, such as any knowledge of other sources, or details that might jeopardise their ability to publish, or the safety of other people. Hopefully that dataset is much smaller to the extent that someone acting as a courier can bring sufficient information &quot;in his head&quot; that remaining details can be rendered &quot;harmless&quot; by leaving out the information passed directly.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that Greenwald has admitted Miranda carried documents, as that makes very little sense - presumably they understood the potential of confiscation, and any documents would not be much more secure than if transferred directly.<p>However Miranda might have carried with him knowledge of information otherwise left out, such as, say, pass phrases or a way to derive additional pass phrases that would allow any intercepted data to be protected better - any data on his devices ought to be inconsequential (at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d hope, especially given Snowden mentioning that he started trusted Poitras when he realised she was more paranoid about him than he was about her).<p>One such method would be for Miranda and/or other associates to take more than one trip. If intercepted you need to try again. If not, one or more of the files transferred might be a set of one time pads and all you need to do to massive increase security is to use said one time pads.",1376988597

The Creative commons site is explicit that the CC BY SA license is their license that is closest to open source and do not say that all CC licenses are open source. For me, the precense of the NC tag has always torn me in different directions wondering do I understand this stuff well enough as my understanding is that Opendesk is not actually open, (nor is wikihouse).<p>With my own separate endevour, I have thought alot about this and wonder what parts of our furniture and the furniture of our community should we open source and what parts should we be opposed to. Opensourcing the design project is fundamentally destructive to the current model of design of which they are pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s to that project, the main pro being that you potentially enlarge the size of the design field which would have be proven, the con being that you discount the value of the design where designers are potentially unable to pay their cost of living which is not a glorious project.<p>Opensouring CNC joints in a beautiful collection is much closer to what I intend to mean by open source, i.e that the components are open sourced so that community and other communities can create great designs. I believe that primitives should also be opensourced that are not attributed to any designer such as square table with no design thought, much of what may be perceived as classical woodworking designs that have been around for decades if not centuries. But as for opensourcing the final design of the desk you guys have designed, I am fundamentlly against, nevertheless you haven&#x27;t open-sourced it yet, merely used open source in name for now.",1376986537

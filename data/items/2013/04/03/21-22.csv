Perhaps I need to be more explicit for you: Go does have green threads with M:N scheduling, which is a powerful feature of Erlang that most other languages do not have.<p>> Basically, the one and only commonality is that they're mapped M:N on OS threads, which is on par with comparing a wheelie bin and a CAT 797F on grounds that they both have 4 wheels.<p>I'm more convinced by Armstrong's argument [1] (and my own experience). Green threads enable a <i>concurrent</i> style of programming that is not viable in most other programming languages. (See also: Concurrent ML and Concurrent Haskell, although the former is not parallel.)<p>> Goroutine's semantics and implementation are nothing like Erlang's processes: the latter are shared-nothing, preempted, monitorable and messageable whereas goroutines are shared-memory cooperative black holes.<p>I have drawn on an important similarity between goroutines and Erlang processes. I did not dispute their differences, although I think your comparison is overly simplistic.<p>Also, you ignored my rebuttal to your claim that Go's ""basically only use case is network servers.""

However, maybe he just needs a better way of life, a healthier diet, more interaction, more outside time, less participation in a caustic, chemical society. You wouldn't know that, unless you tried to exceed the imposition of cultural 'normality' imposed on you by your society, by, frankly, leaving it behind.</i><p>You have absolutely no idea of how much of an asshole you are being right now.  You have your opinion, absolutely no facts about my personal situation, are making a ton of assumptions, and yet think that YOU have the right to lecture ME on this subject.<p>For the record, my son gets a much healthier diet than is standard in our society.  He gets several hours outside every day.  We have never had a working TV in his life.  As he has grown we have allowed him movies - typically under 4 hours per week.  He goes for regular hikes.  Yes, we use medicine, but only the minimum necessary to affect his ability to pay attention in school hours.<p>When he is not on medication, the following sequence is common.  I can address him by name, he looks at me, and I tell him to put his socks and shoes on.  This repeats 3x at 2 minute intervals.  His socks and shoes remain not on, and when I ask him to tell me what I've been asking him to do he honestly doesn't know that I want him to put on socks and shoes.  Not because he's malicious, but because he simply was lost in his thoughts.<p>Yes, that is a culture-specific requirement.  But if he was being raised in a ""natural hunting/gathering society"" he'd be the kid who gets eaten by a tiger because he was too busy looking at a spider to watch out.<p>Now you may think that there isn't a problem here.  But I'm the parent here, you're the stranger, you know nothing about my situation, and it is my job to decide what measures are required to make sure that he grows up to be able to survive in society to my satisfaction.

5489295,comment,5488957,5488957,7,0,deepblueocean,,,"This demonstrates perhaps the largest real threat to the bitcoin ecosystem right now: the exchange markets are heavily concentrated. Confidence in the system is, right now, heavily based on the perception that Bitcoins can be traded readily for <i>something</i> (pizza, drugs, dollars, quatloos...). Anything that alters that perception will, of course, have a big effect on the price.<p>In fact, exchange risk could lead to something akin to a bank run - the exchanges only keep a small reserve of national currencies and Bitcoins to handle orders and are essentially acting as market makers. But a big swing in the demand for either Bitcoin or real currencies could push the exchanges into a tight spot. If they don't have enough Bitcoin, obviously, the price rises until the demand for Bitcoin subsides. But if they don't have enough (say) dollars, then the price <i>must</i> fall. And there's a natural death spiral: as the price falls, particularly after such a big run up as has happened recently, people might suddenly decide that it's time to get out. But that only increases the demand for (scarce) dollars. And so the value collapses.<p>Here's the real Bitcoin security question: can someone <i>precipitate</i> this situation? Maybe someone who benefits from a collapse of the Bitcoin price (say a law enforcement agency that wants to affect the Silk Road business or, if you don't like that, then say any entity with a significant short position on Bitcoin exchange markets). This is not a question I've seen previously addressed in Bitcoin literature or even musings on the various Bitcoin forums. It's a security economics question. I'm interested in the answer.<p>By the way, my current favorite term for such a situation is the ""Goldfinger attack"" on the theory that while Goldfinger wanted to steal the gold from Ft. Knox (in the novel version), such an adversary wants to invalidate the coins in Mt. Gox.",1365024883

5489240,comment,5487316,5487316,18,0,latchkey,,,"I am working for a fairly large heroku app running Node on ~50-100 web dyno's with another 20-50 backends. Here are the problems as I see it:<p>We get H12's all the time. Randomly. The only suggestion we get from Heroku is to make the requests process as fast as possible. Thus, we've spent considerable amount of time going through everything we can possibly do to make all requests respond as fast as possible. I've given up. I see this as a fundamental issue with the routing system. If you are going to use Heroku for a large production deployment, H12's (and your users getting dropped connections) will become a fact of life.<p>There is no auto scaling. We have no idea how many dyno's we actually need. So, we over do it in order to handle peek traffic times. This must be a great money maker for Heroku. There is no incentive for them to build auto scaling into their system because that would mean they wouldn't make as much money. Yes, auto scaling is a hard problem to solve, but there should at least be a plan to start on it and there is none that I have found.<p>Up until someone bitched loudly, nothing was happening to fix any of this. We have an expensive paid support contract with Heroku and before this whole routing issue blew up in public, their only recommendation was to tune the app more and buy into NewRelic for ~$8k / month. We did both and found NewRelic to not give any relevant information to help us. We did a NodeTime trial for ~$49/mo and that actually helped a lot in identifying slow spots in our app. We fixed all the slow spots in our app and still see an endless stream of H12's. Regardless, it shouldn't take a public bitch slapping for a company to listen to their customers.<p>You log into a dyno and see a load average of 30+. Who knows if that number is accurate or how big the underlying box really is, but regardless, I can't imagine that number being good. Am I getting H12's because I'm on an overloaded box or is it because the routing system is fundamentally broken? I don't know and nobody can tell me. This is not a good position to be in.<p>I have heard from several sources that Heroku isn't happy being on AWS and has been wanting to migrate off AWS for a while now. So, if your hosting provider isn't happy on their hosting provider, there must be a reason for that and in the bigger picture, you the customer, is getting screwed.<p>Given these things, I will never recommend that a company use Heroku. It is great if you know you are going to never have more than one dyno, but if you think you are going to go into a large production system with it, it is far better to find something else. Which brings me to another rant... how come none of these other PaaS solutions are as easy as Heroku? The git deploy is seriously the one thing they got mostly right. I'd love to see someone build a layer on top of all the PaaS solutions so that I can just deploy my code to any one of them (or event multiple).",1365024445

So any language that targets LLVM should be relatively easy to compile to asm.js.<p>The issue is that asm.js doesn't provide the full JavaScript & DOM API. Calls to native JavaScript functions go through a foreign function interface. The natural design in this case is just as you describe: a self-contained core for high-performance calculations called by a shell of plain JavaScript that can interface with the rest of the world. Similar two-layer patterns are used for NaCl Chrome apps, or games using Lua to script a C++ engine.<p>My original comment was written in the hope that existing language-to-JavaScript compilers could be modified to target asm.js, automatically gaining its performance boost for all future <i>and current</i> projects using, say, GWT. But existing projects aren't written with the two-layer pattern needed to target asm.js effectively. Perhaps the best you could do would be to run every function call that isn't in the module or asm.js stdlib through the FFI. That may not be worthwhile.<p>(Anyone can feel free to correct me if I'm totally off on something. This isn't exactly my specialty.)",1365023879

So it wasn't a distributed systems problem at that point. You could argue that Heroku circa 2009 was more of a prototype or a toy than a scalable piece of infrastructure. You couldn't run background workers, or large databases. We weren't even charging money yet.<p>Implementing a single global queue in a single node is trivial. In fact, this is what Unicorn (and other concurrent backends) do: put a queue within a single node, in this case a dyno. That's how we implemented it in the Heroku router (written in Erlang).<p>Later on, we scaled out to a few nodes, which meant a few queues. This was close enough to a single queue that it didn't matter much in terms of customer impact.<p>In late 2010 and early 2011 our growth started to really take off, and that's when we scaled out our router nodes to far more than a handful. And that's when the global queue effectively ceased to exist, even though we hadn't changed a line of code in the router.<p>The problem with this, of course, is that we didn't give it much attention because we had just launched a new product which made the explicit choice to leave out global queueing. It's this failure to continue full stewardship of our existing product that's the mistake that really hurt customers.<p>So to answer your question, there was never some crazy-awesome implementation of a distributed global queue that we got rid of. It was a single node's queue, a page of code in Erlang which is not too different from the code that you'll find in Unicorn, Puma, GUnicorn, Jetty, etc.",1365023849

We often take the quick path to ""interesting"" ideas by tearing apart good things.  Utopia can't be, write about a dystopia instead.  It is easier that way.  This rut is comfortable.<p>It gets the author out of the hard task of building something that fits together well, and out of having to dream up something that works and that they would genuinely like to live in.  Thinking up terrible things and things that fall apart can be much easier than thinking up what would make us lastingly happy.  It also lets the listeners/readers/viewers of the story not think about their world in relation to some better world.  That can be depressing; looking into a warm, comfy restaurant can just highlight how cold, poor, and hungry you are.   Comparing our lives to those poor schmucks in some ""utopia"" with an terrible dark side isn't so bad; it doesn't impugn us for not having made something truly good to live in a reality.<p>But I'm so glad that Banks didn't go that route.  Sci-fi needs to be able to get out of that rut.  And it isn't that he doesn't know dark topics or how to write them; he can wrench a reader's guts along with the best of 'em.  Yet he did the harder thing of looking for a consistent, shining-happy civilization to dream of living in.  Gene Roddenberry got no small fame for a popular but rather more shoddy try at that many decades back.  Banks did it with top notch sci-fi and writing skill.  And I'd love to live in his utopia too.<p>But the books themselves, not the Culture, also include plenty of gut wrenching.  Not as some easy dark side to the Culture itself.

One of those tradeoffs is more latency per request. Another is availability on the app. Despite the sentiment here on Hacker News, most of our customers tell us that they're not willing to trade lower availability and higher latency per request for the efficiencies of a global request queue.<p>Are there other routing implementations that would be a happy medium between pure random (routers have no knowledge of what dynos are up to) and perfect, single global queue (routers have complete, 100% up-to-date knowledge of what dynos are up to)? Yes. We're experimenting with those; so far none have proven to be overwhelmingly good.<p>In the meantime, concurrent backends give the ability to run apps at scale on Heroku today; and offer other benefits, like cost efficiencies.

10976012,comment,10975254,10975772,0,0,JadeNB,,,"> The next thing I look to see happen is automated speeding tickets. There&#x27;s no reason radars shouldn&#x27;t be set up in conjuction with license plate readers, or actually just pulling speed data from cars with in-car transmission ability and tickets being auto-generated to constituents.<p>This seems like a Catch-22, though.  Any state that actually enforced speeding laws systematically would wind up ticketing (almost) all drivers, (almost) all the time, and the selective nature of current enforcement of speeding limits would become so glaringly apparent that (one hopes) the problems with it couldn&#x27;t be ignored.<p>Especially in a state like Texas, where &quot;no regulation&quot; is a religious mantra, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that the result would be anything but raising the speed limits on the road to reflect actual driving conditions—which, I&#x27;d argue, is a good thing.  (I don&#x27;t know anything about the reason, but I do know that, on a stretch of I-35 that I have driven regularly for a few years, the speed limit has increased; and the trend statewide seems to be towards higher limits, with much of I-10 having a speed limit of 80 mph—beyond which I, as a Prius driver, wouldn&#x27;t go significantly even if I were legally allowed to do so.)",1453841931

If the baseline is zero and the top line goes up then the two of them diverge.&quot;<p>The author&#x27;s mistake here is to assume &quot;being more effective&quot; has any real bearing on who is the most successful; random chance providing a substantial push in the right direction and then post-facto narratives denying chance are far more likely. Environmental factors increase exposure to upside of chance while minimizing the downside risk. Therefore, rich white people are typically thought of as the &quot;most successful&quot; people because they were born to a similar demographic which ensured they would land in an okay spot.<p>&quot;Is it really such an issue if a few people get rich so a lot of people can wealthy?&quot;<p>The &quot;lot of people&quot; aren&#x27;t get wealthy. Most people are getting less wealthy while the very richest are getting substantially more wealthy. By and large, nobody is &quot;getting rich&quot; so much as &quot;getting richer&quot;. As someone else said, &quot;a rising tide lifts all boats, but most people can&#x27;t afford a boat, so they drown.&quot;<p>&quot;I’ve never met a wealthy person that hates the poor but I’m shocked by the number of poor(er) people I know who hate the wealthy. I never really understand why since they’ve never obviously suffered at the rich’s hands. But then it something doesn’t have to be obviously bad to add up. It just has to be occasional, careless or callous and over time  it accumulates.&quot;<p>Ah, an out-of-touch comment by a rich man; the poor &quot;hate&quot; the rich because they frequently seem as though they are from a different and better planet, and they really think that it would be much better if all the poors could just move to that planet gracefully, like they did. After all, &quot;I did it so anyone can do it.&quot; Completely and self-servingly ignoring the reality of wildly different starting conditions while subtly implying that their final superiority is some sort of inherent Aryan guarantee.<p>Additionally, the poor do obviously suffer at the rich&#x27;s hands, though perhaps they don&#x27;t see it this way: bank overdraft charges, paychecks on prepaid cards, more scrutiny and arrests for trivial offenses from law enforcement, increasing rents, outrageously expensive and ineffective health insurance, etc.<p>Anyways, just to put this topic directly to bed, the wealth gap is actually bad, and the lack of empathy that the rich have for the poor is a historical fact rather than an issue itself. The IMF is against wealth inequality and has detailed how and why in depth: <a href=""https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf</a> and to be blunt, they know better than any of us here. The bottom line is that, as the report says, &quot;Societies with greater income inequality experience slower and less stable economic growth.&quot; Even the capitalists have to get on board with solving the problem of inequality when it&#x27;s framed that way.",1453841876

Some regulation that requires speed-checkers in every car built, and reporting to find out any time your car goes over the speed limit, regardless if there&#x27;s a camera in sight.

Yeah, you <i>want</i> the speed limit to be 35 (for the kids, of course), but now that you get penalized instantly when you break the rule you agreed on, the fine won&#x27;t be so enjoyable.

The fact the absolutes were in error for a single portion of a single vertical among multiple firms implies its an incentive problem which the paper agrees. It just draws the line in a different place because its analyzing a different question [Insiders vs. Outsiders rather than Insiders vs. Insiders].<p>> The answer may well involve the information and incentive structures present inside Wall Street firms. Employees who could recognize the iceberg looming in front of the ship may not have been listened to, or they may not have had the right incentives to speak up. If so, then the information and incentive problems giving rise to the crisis would not have existed between mortgage industry insiders and outsiders, as the inside job story suggests. Rather, these problems would have existed between different floors of the same Wall Street firm.<p>The paper believes its internal to the firms but the uniformity of the problem between firms implies it was the culture of all the large firms and likely exported to the credit bureaus due to heavy competition in a single vertical. The difference between what the paper is arguing vs. what I&#x27;m arguing is likely impossible to determine because of the incestuous movements between those firms and even the credit bureaus of the human capital involved.",1453841272

10975716,comment,10971662,10975265,0,0,rbehrends,,,"> 1) What is the crime rate committed by Muslim immigrants, as compared to natives? (You suggest it&#x27;s higher. How much higher?)<p>No, I don&#x27;t suggest it&#x27;s higher. I suggest that there is no obvious correlation between religion and crime rate. The lowest crime rate (by far, as in a factor of three or so below the average) is among Syrians (a predominantly Muslim country), then Iraqis (another predominantly Muslim country), then a mix of other countries (predominantly Balkan countries with a Christian majority, but also Afghanistan). Most criminals per capita come from Serbia, by a huge margin (and still make up a relatively small fraction of Serbian immigrants). The natural conclusion is that crime rate is correlated with other factors, not religion.<p>> 2) What&#x27;s the crime rate for Muslim immigrants of low socio-economic status, compared to Germans of low socio-economic status?<p>Nobody has dug that deeply into the data yet. Partly because religion isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s accurately known (even in Germany, only a minority of Muslims self-identified as Muslims in the most recent census, for whatever reasons; whether the rest acted out of privacy concerns or because they have been secularized, I do not know). I do know that one study (a couple of decades ago, mind you) that tried to adjust for social-economic factors between Turkish immigrants (predominantly Muslim, though you have to distinguish between Sunnis and Alevites) and Germans did not find any real measurable difference after that.<p>> 3) How many additional robberies/rapes/murders/etc will result from allowing in 1000 extra immigrants? (Compute by projecting from existing crime data.)<p>You cannot extrapolate, because so far the projection is not linear in the number of refugees. This probably has a number of reasons: for starters, violent crime appears to be concentrated within refugee reception centers as the result of people living close together with little room for privacy and under less than ideal conditions; but as the number of refugees grows, the number of refugees within reception centers doesn&#x27;t. For another, other serious crime appears to be concentrated within criminal organizations that do not grow at the same rate as the number of refugees.<p>Most importantly, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s an actual policy option for allowing or not allowing them in. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the refugees are coming to Europe now because other countries are overflowing and can&#x27;t take any more. Unlike America, Europe isn&#x27;t surrounded by oceans to keep refugees out. Any credible attempt at controlling the influx of refugees has to begin with the border between Greece and Turkey, which is difficult for a number of reasons (starting with the quasi-cold war between Greece and Turkey and the fact that you cannot just let refugees drown). Even if the border could be controlled, there is no guarantee that refugees would not find a way through, say, Russia (which is already happening, after all, and it&#x27;s not like Putin wouldn&#x27;t have an incentive to show them the way). Any policy that assumes that you can make a major dent into the refugee influx is pure fantasy, IMO.<p>> Perhaps. But when the racist right points out this &quot;botched response&quot; (designed to hide the truth), surely you can understand why this gets them extra credibility with voters? And similarly, does anyone besides the racists have a plan to prevent another Cologne?<p>The racists don&#x27;t have a plan to prevent another Cologne. Not a credible one, anyway. They live in a fantasyland where you can just push a button and immigration stops.<p>In the end, what happened in Cologne is like a mass shooting in the US: individually, a horrific event, but one for which there is no quick and easy public policy response, and in the end, does not pose a much bigger statistical risk than being hit by lightning. The best public policy response to Cologne is probably to recognize that the suspects primarily belong to existing organized crime groups and therefore to deal with these gangs. That, unfortunately, does not have an easy solution, but comes down to pretty traditional police work. The biggest problem in this area is that budget cuts have hit law enforcement pretty hard; Germany could definitely use quite a few more police officers.<p>In any event, the biggest public policy challenges lie in the civil sector right now: for example, teaching refugees the language and teaching them skills that make them employable is one of the biggest concerns, but there&#x27;s a shortage of teachers.",1453839624

Yes, its rendering code has historically been comically inefficient to the point that third-party hacks have made huge differences in frame rate and usable draw distance, but that&#x27;s hardly the only thing Minecraft implements poorly.<p>The combination of using Java and being coded naively means that there&#x27;s a huge amount of pointer chasing and unnecessary dynamic memory allocation that can be easily cut out without even needing to dip into the data structures and algorithms literature to try for asymptotic improvements. There&#x27;s no SIMD and no concern for cache locality. Last time I checked, it didn&#x27;t even look like terrain generation was done in a separate thread from the interactive game logic, let alone in multiple threads. The game only simulates dynamics within ~128 blocks of a player, but if you&#x27;ve got two players miles apart they&#x27;re still simulated on the same thread.<p>I do fully understand that the dynamic modifiability of Minecraft&#x27;s game world means that it is always going to be hungry for memory bandwidth and will be latency-sensitive. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it has to be inefficient. The Pocket Edition (not Java) already showed that huge improvements are possible, because they were necessary to get anything resembling Minecraft onto mobile platforms. There&#x27;s a lot more that can be done when you&#x27;re back on a platform that has sufficient RAM capacity and a ton more CPU power relative to RAM speed. There&#x27;s a lot of latency that can be eliminated and a lot more than can be hidden from the user without breaking the game.

Git integration is between unusable and useless (after 10y+ of work). etc etc<p>Plus energy is still flowing, look at Spacemacs, it&#x27;s a lot less absurd than emacs, with a more stable plugin mechanism.

The very first meeting was just three of us meeting in a coffee shop after one guy started by boldly registering the web domain and looking for interest.<p>This eventually grew to a consistent weekly social meeting in the back room of a coffee shop. Over time informality gave way to an official club with officers. We started collecting dues to save money for a lease while still keeping the energy by meeting <i>every</i> week at the coffee shop.<p>I moved away for work soon after graduating in the summer but initially kept in pretty close contact with the group. By January 2010, with the help of a group-merger, Hack Factory of MN dba Twin Cities Maker officially held a lease to a space in town.  Since then they&#x27;ve expanded to lease more of the building. At the Hack Factory you can tinker with electronics, 3d printing, CNC routing, milling, welding, woodworking, textiles,....<p>Even after acquiring the shop, the weekly coffee shop meet turned into a weekly open house on Wednesday evenings that still runs today.<p>Credit for this success goes to the individuals who stepped up to volunteer running this crazy enterprise. I have crazy amounts of respect for everyone who&#x27;s served as an officer or otherwise helped organize things.<p>After returning to town in 2011 I officially rejoined as a member, although I happened to loose much of my enthusiasm for social  tinkering. I was interested, but not committed, so i&#x27;d sit in on board meetings but not actually run for office. Eventually, I spent less and less time at the shop.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve always felt odd talking about my involvement in TC Maker, because other than being one of the first few people in the door, I never personally took much of a real lead role in the organization.

Which is why I don&#x27;t understand the responses here on HN.<p>One says the maps where &quot;metaphorical.&quot; No the maps were extremely precise, or at least as precise as could be for being based on a novel. The maps did take some liberties with scale and distortion, but that was for two obvious reasons: 1) to fit all the information at several scales into one set of maps, and 2) to be pieces of art in themselves. So you could say these were very precise maps with a highly unusual and non-regular projection and lots of embellishment, but they very literally map the journey in the novel. I would argue that they are actually very effective at displaying large and small scale details in the same frame.<p>Notice I said projection. There certainly exists a mathematical function that would transform these maps into WGS 84, or whatever datum you are more used to. Actually, it&#x27;s intriguing to think about that function and how it would work.<p>To the one who thought this had something to do with github, I say you need to be a bit more open and less focused on tech--a common problem on HN, despite the proliferation of non-tech articles. Plus, it&#x27;s not like startups haven&#x27;t been copying each other&#x27;s domain names since forever. I mean it&#x27;s one thing to be surprised that the content is not what you expected from the name alone, it&#x27;s another to leave a comment about it.<p>Finally to SwellJoe, I admire your sense of adventure, but I urge caution. From my own investigations, even with a well-found boat, navigating the Mississippi is beyond novice-level. It&#x27;s been channeled and dredged, has lots of currents, and is plied by commercial traffic. I&#x27;m afraid that even a house-boat wouldn&#x27;t have the power or maneuverability to deal with that--better to get a regular live-aboard motorboat. Search for information on the Great Loop.

If you can devise a statistical process that reliably identifies which features are important, most would tend to agree that is better than relying on human intuition or first-principles from some domain science field to simply assert what they are.<p>But once you&#x27;ve constructed the features via that statistical process, and you plan to just dump them onto the RHS of a regression formulation, then it&#x27;s no better. The same kinds of non-linearities can creep in whether you manually computed a human-level-description of a factor, or you let a statistical decomposition pop the factor out automatically.<p>The main point is that you cannot use most of the success metrics from a frequentist regression for the model selection and policy selection outcomes that most people want to use them for. Theoretically, it is just unsound. You have to dig deeper into the data, look at conditional views of your data, and try to use model fitting procedures that are provably robust to these kinds of artifacts, multicollinearity, and so forth.<p>I think the biggest problem is that non-statistician practitioners who work under tight deadlines in a domain science field tend to just want some kind of cookbook system that &quot;just works 100% of the time.&quot; But there simply is no such thing.

In fact, these kids are <i>not</i> fully aware of the consequences of their actions. By this I'm not saying they're necessarily immature (some might be, some are certainly not), but some are jumping on the bandwagon because the bandwagon is both fun and packs just enough social justice to make the wrong-doing seem fair-game.<p>That being said, I am certainly against what's happening to Wikileaks and Assange. As I heard someone say earlier in the week: if this thing was happening in China and he was exposing <i>that</i> regime, he'd be called a hero.<p>Anon as an organism (no typo) is interesting. The fact that it is guided by the hive mind and not one in particular means it transfigures to good or bad depending on the general mood of the group. That is socially fascinating.",1291939118

That's fine, and if he or she was rude as you mentioned above, that's worth taking into account -- there's no need for the vendor to say more than, ""No thanks, we don't do discounts except for educational institutions, etc.  Our basic version should fully support your needs.""<p>However, two points: (1) it's perfectly reasonable for the vendor to think you're trying to scam him out of his or her higher priced, higher capability software; and (2), using this as a proxy of whether he or she will be flexible and helpful on a larger order is stupid.  Because you entered the door as a cut rate single license purchaser, and used that as a proxy to evaluate the vendor providing bulk services.<p>I've sold highly priced consulting services, and people who want cheap shit get directed elsewhere because that's not what I do.  If you need help for a couple hours and want a discount, the answer is of course not.  If you want 100 hours and want a discount, the answer is of course.  The vendor is in an obviously parallel position.<p>Edit: you in fact just said the vendor was dismissive.  ie you got butthurt because he or she didn't want to give something valuable away for free for a one off.

The app ecomony is going to be like the web's. Cause paid software does not work for the masses. It works for enterprise, it works for the niches like gamers and Mac users, but it will not scale. You can already see this in the App Store's pricing race to the bottom.

The police has arrested in the night of Wednesday to Thursday a 16 year old boy who apparently was involved in the cyber attacks by WikiLeaks sympathizers on amongst others Mastercard and PayPal. This has been announced by the office of the public prosecutor.<p>WikiLeaks sympathisers have started these attacks after the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Great Brittain. With these so-called DDoS attacks hackers want to take revenge on companies that no longer process funds transfers to WikiLeaks. The High Tech Crime Team of the dutch national police had started an investigation after it became clear that these attacks originate in the Netherlands, according to the office of the public prosecutor.<p>Besides Mastercard and PayPal the websites of VISA, the Swedish public prosecutor, the swiss Post Bank have been subjected to attacks as well. The actions of the WikiLeaks sympathisers are carried out under the code name 'PayBack'.<p>The young suspect from The Hague has been interrogated on Thursday and has confessed that he committed attacks on MasterCard and VISA. Police have confiscated computers and data carriers. On Friday he will have to appear in front of a judge in Rotterdam. According to the justice department the boy is part of a group of hackers.<p>The investigation in to this group is still running, according to the public prosecutor. It is not clear whether other suspects are also in the Netherlands or abroad. The justice department does not rule out more arrests.<p>A spokesperson for the public prosecutors office has announced that the justice department will act against those that are actually performing these attacks.

1989713,comment,1988926,1989333,0,0,grellas,,,"Point well made. Here is how I would weave in the legal concerns.<p>Back in the days of unrestrained freedom of association, employers could afford to be direct about their reasons for hiring decisions. A rejection (or any other employment-related decision) could be based on race, sex, age, ethnicity, disability, or even just disliking someone for no good reason. This changed with the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made it illegal to make employment decisions based on any one of several prohibited bases, including race and sex. The effect of that Act and its progeny throughout the United States was to curtail freedom of association by declaring that public policy made it repugnant to allow individuals to engage in invidious discrimination against discrete and insular minorities who needed special protection to prevent their being abused. While this curtailed a form of unrestricted freedom that had theretofore prevailed in society, only a very few opposed it or saw it as anything other than a great social advancement.<p>Once the law began to govern such relations, however, formality inevitably took hold and never let go. Without formality, (a) people could say the wrong things, (b) people could say innocent things that could be twisted into seemingly wrong things, (c) people (following casual exchanges) could make things up about what was said, even if employer representatives had in fact acquitted themselves properly, (d) people could compile statistics and find discrimination in any form of pattern or practice used by an employer even in the absence of overt discriminatory intent by the employer's agents, making it perilous to document explicit reasons too explicitly as a matter of routine practice (e) and people could do wrong things in spite of company policies to the contrary and against the wishes of company management just because, people being people, they can do unpredictable things.<p>In addition to discrimination, the law expanded to further curtail the grounds upon which an employer could choose not to associate with any prospective employee. If an employer adopted policies that were deemed ""against public policy"" for any reason, or if an employer permitted its employees to sexually harass others, or to retaliate against a person who had complained of company wrongdoing, liability lay in wait for the unsuspecting employer.<p>Now take all this and throw it into a mix that depends on a standard of proof that something was ""more likely than not"" to have occurred, and leave it to a jury to weigh conflicting testimony and other evidence - a jury that may well have it out for big company defendants - and you are left with an existential mess for any employers who don't immediately and completely take serious control over employment procedures in their company. Throw in liability exposure arising out of class action as a vehicle for redress (also new to the mix since the 1960s), and you liability risks become paramount over all else. And so everything gets assigned over to HR, leaving it entirely impersonal and sanitized: all in writing, all vague or non-committal, all positively de-humanizing.<p>But what is a modern employer to do? Or at least a big company employer that cannot rely on the discretion of many hundreds or even thousands of individuals to know all the rules, to apply them consistently and correctly, and to avoid being set up legally by some who would attempt to ensnare them?<p>Society has gained greatly from its laws against invidious discrimination but such laws have come at a cost, and the cost is precisely that identified by the author of this piece.  People no longer can just be themselves in relating to one another in many parts of the workplace but need instead to be hyper-cautious and impersonal. Whatever good may have come from the positive side of these laws (and this has been considerable), this is a real price to pay on the downside.<p>Fortunately, in most small company situations, people can afford to exercise much more discretion than they can in large corporations. I think this is where the author is coming from and I too commend him for it. Directness and transparency are outstanding qualities. If the situation is small and controlled, and the people involved have the wits and discretion to avoid obvious legal wrongs and traps, there is much to be gained in building the sort of goodwill that you do by treating people decently even as you might be rejecting them as part of the interview process.",1291936850

The discussion was framed not as an abstract consideration of the virtues of science, but, given that we have important problems that need solving, are we approaching the solution in the best manner? Or, by conflating ""science"" and ""engineering"", are we accidentally satisfying ourselves that we are making progress when in fact we are investing too much in science and not enough in engineering, a mistake we might not make if we did not freely conflate the two so frequently?<p>In the specific context of solving real world problems, this question has meaning, and it's not the generic ""useless science is useless"" argument, it's actually grounded in very real considerations.<p>This is part of the reason I posted in the first place, as people are getting drawn to the strange attractor of the generic science vs. engineering question I felt people were missing out on the more interesting and more subtle question brought up by the article itself.

The constant text ads in the corner were only moderately distracting and annoying (they tend to cover up parts of the screen you want to see, having them in one of the left hand corners would be better IMO).  I noticed yesterday that every few minutes it now loads up a ~30-second video commercial.  Some of them have still-image preludes that cannot be skipped, but so far there has been a ""skip"" button for all the video ads.  The ads are pretty high-quality, movie trailers and professionally-done commercials, but it's much, much more disruptive to the play experience than it was before.<p>I still enjoy the game quite a bit, but I'd much rather just pay the 99 cents than burn 45 seconds every 5 minutes to watch an ad.",1291935883

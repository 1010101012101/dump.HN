401,comment,227,240,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I did the first 7 semesters of my undergrad in physics, and still have a lot of friends doing Ph.Ds in physics.  A bachelors in physics opens up a large expanse of possibilities - finance, management consulting, economics consulting, computer programming, high school math teacher, and of course physics grad school.  A Ph.D in physics qualifies you for exactly one job: physics professor.  There are far more opportunities for a physics drop-out than a physics Ph.D, particularly for someone who doesn't absolutely, positively love the subject.",1172094803

398,comment,227,369,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I got the impression from James's post that he wasn't actually &#34;giving up&#34; his millions, he was locking up all future profits in the business and reinvesting them.  He converted HotOrNot from an S-corporation to a C-corporation.  You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can't give out different classes of shares, so there's an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.  The incentive is to build up the business and eventually seek an IPO, acquisition, or other liquidity event.

It almost looks like James is positioning HotOrNot to get big and get bought.",1172093867

Adding hyperlinks before there's solid infrastructure for dealing with spam would be a mistake.  I'll be surprised if more than few days go by before spam shows up, even without hyperlinks.",1172093812

393,comment,363,378,0,0,dpapathanasiou,,,"Well, people tend to dislike it if you submit your own blog posts (you're biased, too wordy, trumpeting your own horn, etc.).

So this would be a place to hold virtual design reviews: ask people to look and provide objective feedback; the comments thread would function as the Q&A part between the hacker and the community of reviewers.",1172093032

New feature: Why not combine the scoring with Flickr like tags.  Instead of just being limited to increasing/decreasing an items karma,  give me the option of increasing/decreasing tags, and the ability to add a new tags of my own which others could then vote on.  This would probably be a good feature for Reddit as well.  They could do away with the handful of subreddits they have and use this tagging scheme instead.

391,comment,227,369,0,0,jmzachary,,,"There's risk and then there's prudent risk. Taking a 12 month sabbatical to focus on the startup would be a prudent risk. And, it's going all the way, just for 12 months. If you don't know in 12 months if the business will succeed, it probably won't (especially in this space). Anyway, I wish the guy lots of luck and success. I supposed if he makes millions, he can always go back.",1172092497
390,comment,363,363,0,0,rmack005,,,"I know this is an early version and things are still a bit rough, but just for the record:

1) The number beside my user name (top of the page) is a bit confusing.  At first I thought maybe it meant I had some sort of message waiting to be read, or perhaps that I'd made one comment, which didn't make sense because I'd just created the account.  Perhaps a label before the number would clear things up: (karma: 1).

2) I didn't realize at first that the arrows were used for voting.  The main page (http://news.ycombinator.com/) had only &#34;up&#34; arrows.  I figured they were used to collapse/expand additional content, so I ended up inadvertently trying to vote for several arbitrary items (I hadn't created an account yet, so the votes didn't count - I don't think).  Once I saw the &#34;up&#34; and &#34;down&#34; arrows together I got their purpose.  Perhaps, instead of removing one (or both) of the arrows you could simply display a ghosted one?  Or perhaps replace the arrows with thumb up/down icons?

3) &#34;7 points by pg 1 hour ago | 7 comments&#34; reads like you (pg) added 7 points an hour ago.  Is this meant instead: &#34;7 points | by pg | 1 hour ago | 7 comments&#34;?

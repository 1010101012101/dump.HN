I&#x27;d suggest since there is no money at stake in the first 3 months they are holding out to pressure for slightly better terms (and a couple headlines never hurt sales) and then will jump on in 3 months once the money is actually flowing.<p>You&#x27;ll note that there will always be many people in the 3 month free trial, Swift isn&#x27;t threatening to hold her album out forever (or her other music!) to stop the supposed bad business model, just for the 3 launch months when guaranteed revenue zero.<p>Kudos to these artists for knowing where their leverage is and using it though!<p>Apple has a couple options:<p>(1) just eat it, prolly what happens.<p>(2) they can pay up a bit but the big labels would be steamed at getting a worse deal than independents so that isn&#x27;t happening.<p>(3) pay everyone a little bit more for the launch months. This might happen but the clock is ticking.<p>(4) they can make these artists sit out longer than the initial 3 months. That compromises the quality of their service though.  Still they might do it, hoping it would pressure them to signing up for the release.<p>(5) they could weight the streaming for awhile so that holdout artists appear less than they might normally.  I expect this might happen but if they do this hopefully be done openly (&quot;we&#x27;re rewarding our launch partners&quot;).<p>(6) go back in time and do a 3 month beta rollout so money is at stake when you do the big rollout with the new phone.",1434891135

I also hang out with the startup crowd in Sydney (I&#x27;ve been invited to a couple of events and was able to talk with founders/CEOs and engineers of some of these startups).<p>One thing that really stands out about Australia is that tech startups here last a long time (they don&#x27;t seem to ever &#x27;run out of money&#x27;). Investors are patient and they invest cautiously; in fact, if they like your idea, they will &#x27;keep tabs&#x27; on you and they won&#x27;t invest a single dollar until you have some meaningful numbers to show them - And by numbers that means either decent revenue (yes, REVENUE) or exceptional user growth (coupled with a clear monetization plan).<p>That&#x27;s both good and bad. It means it&#x27;s very difficult for early starters to get funding in Australia, but it means that once you do get that funding, you can expect the investor to stick around. I have worked for 2 startups which had been operating on a modest loss for 5+ years - One of them had almost no growth and little potential (in my opinion), the other had modest growth but high potential. These startups don&#x27;t seem to have problems raising further rounds of capital year after year.<p>I found that Australian startups are lean and have a low marketing budget - They tend to spend everything on the product and generally don&#x27;t like hiring sales people or paying for advertising unless it gives them an immediate, measurable return - They don&#x27;t spend money just to create hype.<p>Australian founders tend to dismiss the importance of advertising - They believe that if they put all the focus on product development, that eventually, the product will become so good that it will just blow away the competition (who have wasted all of their funding on advertising).<p>US startups generate a massive amount of noise in the market - Spending on advertising at the moment would just create more white-noise - You won&#x27;t get a return on that.

You just need those few digits and don&#x27;t care about the head or title or the structure of dom or anything else. In such cases (and it&#x27;s very common task for people working on data extractions) no complex parsers can ever compete with the regexp in terms of speed and memory footprint.

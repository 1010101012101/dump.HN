It's more important to release first.  There are also examples (I forget the specific word for this, maybe somebody here knows?) where people living far away from each other came up with the same ways to cope with nature, without any possible way to know of anybody else's ideas.",1176353929

If you aspire to build a big online media business (say $50m in revenues) you can do it in one of three ways:<p>   1. If youre broad reach, you need to grow to be one of the top 10 websites in the US by traffic\n   2. If youre demographically targeted, you need to grow to be one of the top 25 websites in the US\n   3. If you have content that attracts endemic advertisers, you need to grow to be one of the top 150 websites in the US<p>Analysis and math that gets to these conclusions is at the Lightspeed Venture Partners blog (click on my name in this comment).\njeremy liew on March 13th, 2007 at 12:27 PM",1176351896

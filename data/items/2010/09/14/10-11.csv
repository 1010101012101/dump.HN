Small scale manufacturing of bicycle parts is confined to high-value niche areas.<p>I'm afraid I don't see much evidence of decentralised manufacturing here in .au, apart from offshoring, which I doubt has much to do with the sort of open manufacturing you seem to have in mind.

So, the union won't let the budget slide in the direction of infrastructure spending rather than wages and staff spending, simultaneously the fare fixing keeps the pool of money for the system fairly static.<p>Thus, infrastructure projects in public transport are glacial / non existent depending on your point of view, for about the past fifteen years I have been hearing about a line being added between Epping and Parramatta that is still yet to be completed, I'm not sure it's even been started.<p>The fact that the public transport is so bad results in people that really need to keep a tight schedule attempting to minimise their reliance on said system, they'll get a car or move some place very close to their place of work (thus perhaps contributing to the ridiculous rents and real estate prices in Sydney).

This seems like something written by a 20-year-old, somebody who has worked in academia, volunteer projects, or a startup. Or put another way, somebody from an environment where endless talk prevents work from happening.<p>In timebox-driven development, every so often you have to produce something of value. So while I've never said STFU to a team, everybody knows that discussion has to start and stop based on the reality of <i>doing something</i> (which the author seems to be big on) Or better yet, the discussion continues all along; the topics and depth of discussion changes as the team moves forward.<p>Here's a little tidbit: in a corporate situation, once a team starts working at any degree of efficiency at all, the real problem is getting the rest of the business to understand and agree on what the team is supposed to be getting paid for. Lots of work can go into ""business alignment"" -- getting people on the same page. Technology teams become business decision-support teams. It makes sense if you think about it. Most of the time the real reason something isn't fixed is because people never could agree on exactly what the problem is or how to fix it. To the unaware and impatient, this can certainly seem like ""endless talking"". In fact it can become ""endless talking"" -- or not -- depending on the people skills of the team members.<p>So yes, if I were working on a volunteer team in a startup situation -- a place where there is no immediate customer and both the problem and solution are unknown -- I'd say we have to start putting some code down and getting more of a basis to talk. But I'd never say STFU. I don't know if the author thinks he's being cute or not, but that's just asinine. He's writing an article that applies to 30% of all X, generalizing to the rest of the group, and making sweeping profanity-laced statements in an attempt to drive his point home.<p>Unfortunately, no matter how many times you say ""fuck"", how much predicate calculus you use, or how confident you are, you can still screw the pooch by not knowing wtf you're talking about.<p>I'm not going to get into the whole ""context is king"" part of this because there's too much to straighten out in this brief format. He's on to something, just draws the wrong conclusion.<p>This article would have worked better as an ""sometimes I get really upset and want to say STFU and start coding!"" instead of a ""This is reality, get used to it"".<p>If the author is reading, keep the good work coming! Just be careful with generalizations: you can get away with them when you're right for 85-95% of the cases, but in this case it doesn't work.",1284459462

Sure it sucks when your wedding ring is stolen, but <i>he</i> has to endure it in all parts of his life!<p>Snarkiness aside, being late is <i>not</i> a medical/neurological issue, or something that just /happens' to people. It's a character flaw that only exists because the person who has it doesn't have the will or willpower to change it. It affect everybody he/she interacts with yet through sheer arrogance and self-centeredness, nothing is done about it. No sugar coating on this one - I'm willing to accept that a minority of fat people do genuinely have medical issues, and that dyslectics truly have malfunctioning brains, but for people that are chronically too late, we shouldn't make excuses.<p>(not meant as an attack, if it sounds hostile it's because I've wound myself up over the this the last two weeks at least a dozen times. People are actually surprised when you're on time, or try to make it to appointments even when there are some minor obstacles!

The microscopic laws allow reversible processes only because they begin with &quot;a genuine equilibrium process for which the entropy production vanishes at all times,&quot; the scientists write in their paper. Preparing such an ideal initial state in a physical system is extremely complex, and the initial states of all observed processes aren&#x27;t at &quot;genuine equilibrium,&quot; which is why they lead to irreversible processes.<p>Read more at: <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2015-12-physicists-thermodynamic-irreversibility-quantum.html#jCp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2015-12-physicists-thermodynamic-irreve...</a>\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>...

10668006,comment,10650347,10661511,0,0,codygman,,,"> This is subjective, but having tried Elm with its Haskellish type system, it seems that the type system makes me think hard about things that ultimately don&#x27;t matter much. It might depend on your problem, but I doubt it. Even doing numerical computation with Theano I find myself better off just executing subexpressions and seeing results and the shape of the tensors interactively is more useful than thinking really hard how the operations transform the shape.<p>If it is true that the type system, perhaps static type systems in general, make you think hard about things that ultimately don&#x27;t matter much... why not go for the most dynamic and interactive language possible? Clojure perhaps.<p>I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea that either fully dynamic and as interactive as possible or full dependent typing is the generally right answer.<p>By right, I mean what you should reach for with most programming tasks if you aren&#x27;t going to put effort into selecting one tailored to your task.",1449122127

Having shares in a company does not automatically give you future revenues. Unless you cash out your shares in the secondary market (if it&#x27;s still a private company), you are not going to see those future revenues directly. If there&#x27;s an exit (IPO/acquisition) or a share buyout, that would be the only other time you would see your shares turn into a liquid asset.

10667892,comment,10651085,10667562,0,0,LukaAl,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting news but I don&#x27;t think it will be Apple. Car manufacturing requires volume to be efficient (like any mass produced product, ça va sans dire). But it is also extremely expensive to ship compare to their retail price (you could put approximately two car in a full size container but 44k iPhones, do the math).\nLet&#x27;s try to do the Apple&#x27;s strategy. Apple could go for the Luxury market (BMW series 7, Maseratis and upper). The price, and more important, the margin you have, is high enough to make the transportation cost low enough. At the same time you don&#x27;t have enough volume to have multiple factory. In this situation you build just one factory. Atlanta is an interesting spot due to it&#x27;s good connections with the rest of the US and it&#x27;s comparatively low labor cost (to the Bay Area). But it is on the east coast while it is probable an Apple Car in this price range will have more buyer on the West Coast. Plus in car manufacturing labor cost is a small factor (especially in the luxury segment). But staying close to the hq is a very important factor, especially for your first model. Plus, if you are planning to source component from Asia (electric motors, chips, batteries) being close to a port like LA or San Francisco could be a benefit.<p>Let&#x27;s make the hypothesis that Apple is going for a relatively mass market instead (affordable premium, a BMW series 3, but the reasoning holds also for cheap subcompact). Apple probably needs more than one production plant if it plans to launch internationally, but a single plant is enough for the US market and the reasoning before still holds. Actually, in this scenario Apple needs to work out faster the productions issue so being closer to home is beneficial.<p>This obviously is true if you think Apple will produce the car. But it doesn&#x27;t make sense based on their production philosophy, and it will be a massive investment when there are &quot;white label&quot; car manufacture ready to be the Foxconn of Apple Car. The first name I could came up is Magna Steyr but if they go for low volume super luxury there are a bunch of small manufacturer in Italy with a good pedigree (Touring, Bertone) with the know how, the production capacity, and the brand that fits Apple needs.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you are wrong, even if my bet for the plant in Atlanta is for a European Automaker, I&#x27;m just saying that looking at the logistics, building a plant in Atlanta is not really effective for Apple. Probably tax breaks could change this balance, but I doubt you could have secrecy and tax breaks for a business of this size.",1449119677

But in my risk-averse world, I have always thought that the idea of taking pre-orders is more to secure customer commitment, rather than to fund production.<p>I have a hobby business in a niche where I&#x27;ve seen a few small entrepreneurs take pre-orders (often 50% down payments), spend the money, go broke, and face a bunch of angry customers. They can&#x27;t deliver product, and they can&#x27;t refund the money. It&#x27;s possible that those were cases where something like a family emergency pulled them under.<p>But watching those failures taught me the lesson -- similar to what the OP suggests -- that down payments are a loan from the customer. In my own case, I decided that it was preferable to risk my own money than somebody else&#x27;s, and I kinda crawled out of the starting gates by doing all of my own production using small runs of parts. Thus my margins were lower, but my risk was commensurately lower too.<p>As it turns out, my business easily saturated its own world market quickly enough that I still sell a few units a week but am glad that I didn&#x27;t try to scale up too soon. My only regret is that I have so far missed the chance to learn how to scale up a hardware business.",1449119442

All seventy-five million people in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are now free to move to Britain and work.

In fact, only 427,000 East Europeans have so far applied to work in Britain (many of whom were already in the country illegally) – and most stay only briefly: net migration from eastern Europe was only 48,000 in 2004.5 Unemployment remains at thirty-year lows, tax receipts are up and jobs that British people no longer want to do are being filled.&quot;<p>-- Philippe Legrain",1449119431

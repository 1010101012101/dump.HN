6491583,comment,6491144,6491350,20,0,schoen,,,"In most DRM systems the information is distributed encrypted. The decryption keys are given to technology developers who have specifically promised to obey the DRM rules, as well as to make their technology hard for users to understand or modify so that the users can&#x27;t easily undo the restrictions or extract the decryption keys.<p>Hence a browser developer or OS developer or developer of whatever software is in question wouldn&#x27;t be permitted (by the DRM system&#x27;s inventor or administrator) to get decryption keys if they didn&#x27;t promise to implement these restrictions.<p>Some of the people who invented the modern DRM business ecology called this &quot;the intersection of technology, law, and commercial licensing&quot; (the title of a 1996 article by Dean Marks and Bruce Turnbull). Here, the &quot;technology&quot; is DRM implementations -- including software obfuscation and other measures; the &quot;law&quot; is anticircumvention laws like the DMCA 1201 that make it risky for people to use the decryption keys in ways that industry dislikes; and &quot;commercial licensing&quot; is the permission from a DRM developer to interoperate with that DRM, including &quot;compliance&quot; rules (about the functionality of the technology product) and &quot;robustness&quot; rules (about tamper-resistance), that result in the licensee being issued decryption keys.<p>In my view (I worked on EFF&#x27;s objection) this is a deliberate attack on software interoperability: the whole point is to allow someone to try to prevent interoperability with software that hasn&#x27;t been &quot;approved&quot;. And it&#x27;s also in extreme tension with the idea of having browsers that end-users can modify (their individual instances of).",1380830346

There isn&#x27;t Process for obtaining an opinion that you can then ascribe to an organisation rather than one or more individuals. It only represents the browser makers insofar as the specs hosted at whatwg.org accurately reflect what browsers implement. Sometimes this is achived by adjusting the browsers to match the specs; oftentimes the opposite occurs.<p>It is certainly the case that several individuals editing specs under the WHATWG banner have set out their opposition to DRM. It seems unlikely that Hixie will include it the HTML spec he edits unless, of course, we end up with something implemented in browsers that is both interoperable and open. Since &quot;open&quot; rather defeats the point of DRM, it&#x27;s difficult to imagine that happening, however.",1380830192

6491551,comment,6489468,6489468,22,0,reikonomusha,,,"I unfortunately have some doubts about the authenticity of the claims made. I know other people have already shared a similar opinion but I&#x27;d like to candidly provide my own in the event a beginner, intermediate, or even aspiring programmer happens to read this.<p>I often teach programming. Not formally in school, but to friends and family who come to me to learn. When any of them begin to learn, there are always, always trivial roadblocks that the student seems to hit.<p>My brother, who is a very smart person, was beginning to learn Python, and going through Codecademy. He must have spent at least tens of hours on it. The simplest things he just didn&#x27;t grok immediately. For example, the different between variables, strings, and symbols. He would type, for example:<p><pre><code>    print hello world\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    name = john\n    message = my name is + john\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s only the beginning. The idea of data types, the concept that &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;falsity&quot; could be encapsulated in a manipulable piece of data called a &quot;boolean&quot; (which he would pronounce Boe Lean) were definitely not within arm&#x27;s reach. Functions were even more troublesome.<p>It wasn&#x27;t just my brother. I was explaining to a friend, who is a very competent hardware guy, what a lambda function is. The idea that functions can be seen as data themselves. He eventually got it, but it took lots of explaining. And even after that, the small programs he wrote employing his newly found knowledge were riddled with bugs, formatting issues, style issues, and so on.<p>It wasn&#x27;t just my students, it was me as well. My first programs were something like<p><pre><code>    10 REM MY FIRST PROGRAM\n    20 PRINT &quot;WHAT IS YOUR NAME?&quot;\n    30 INPUT N\n    40 PRINT &quot;HELLO &quot;, N\n    50 GOTO 10\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, this program didn&#x27;t even work in whatever BASIC implementation I was using. I just didn&#x27;t get why. It turns out I needed to add the &#x27;$&#x27; sign to my variables to denote that they&#x27;re strings.<p>When I was writing code for doing arbitrary precision arithmetic, I was representing the numbers as strings of digits: &quot;12345&quot;. I was translating between digit characters and decimal value using the CHR and VAL functions of the language. When I was first introduced to ALLOCATE, typed arrays, etc. it simply did not click and took a while. Pointers, the heap, the stack, BYREF, BYVAL, FREE?<p>If I haven&#x27;t made the point clear, there are a lot of things even we professional programmers take for granted, and things that we have long forgotten were hard, which those starting out with programming have major issues with, and almost deny the possibility of making something substantial in even a single day. Since I regularly teach programming, I am constantly reminded of them.<p>While I suppose it&#x27;s possible to achieve the amazing feat that Jennifer claims on her own and without personal instruction, it just seems unlikely. If it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s great for self-promotion of course, but I don&#x27;t want it to give the aspiring programmer the idea that they should be able to reasonably accomplish the same things she did. What she accomplished wasn&#x27;t just picking up programming, it was:<p><pre><code>    * programming in multiple languages & paradigms\n    * understanding how they relate to each other\n    * setting up programming environments\n    * setting up and understanding 3rd party frameworks and libraries\n    * being able to effectively communicate with programmers\n    * understanding source control and deployment\n</code></pre>\nand then a lot more application specific things. That is a really tall order.<p>If the work was genuinely done by an artist with no technical background with little outside help, then I would consider achievement incredibly brilliant. If it was notwhich is how I feelthen I think the audience deserves a bit of honesty.",1380830112

Consider the person of unusual ability who takes that bachelor&#x27;s in science and decides to become a schoolteacher instead of going to graduate school. At age 22, the schoolteacher is earning a living wage and can begin making plans to get married and have children. By age 30, when the scientist is forced to start moving around to those $35,000 per year postdocs, the schoolteacher is earning $50,000 per year. By age 44, when the scientist is desperately trying to switch careers, the schoolteacher is making more than $90,000 per year for working nine months (only the better school systems pay $90,000 per year, but remember that we posited a person with a high IQ and motivation sufficient to get through graduate school in science).

They&#x27;d have to negotiate and sign compliance agreements with a raft of DRM providers just to be fully standards-compliant and interoperable.<p>I may be totally naive here, but I&#x27;m not really sure why this matters.  That there is a WC3 standard does not imply that browsers have to adhere to it.  If they didn&#x27;t they simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to access DRM protected content.  From a UX perspective this seems no different from Netflix putting their content behind a login.  Maybe I am being an idiot, if so please correct me, but this doesn&#x27;t really seem like anything to worry about.  The threats implied by EFF, that massive corporations will control content on the internet, seems only true for content published by those massive corporations (and thus are already happening now, with 3rd party DRM ie: Netflix&#x27;s Silverlight player).

Many big companies (Walmart comes to mind) have the capacity to distort the market they&#x27;re in, change the rule of the market itself. Those external effects that goes beyond &quot;simple&quot; competition may be considered unfair.<p>For example in France, Carrefour ( the french walmart ) used dumping for a few decades, destroying any competition, then slowly increased its prices. Logically, competition should emerge but Carrefour is so entrenched into the infrastructure of the market that a competitor cannot really survive. This is a simplification (the french market is more an oligopoly than a monopoly) but the overall scheme is true.<p>Amazon may or may not have one of these effects.

Odds can change over time because of betting activity caused by events, news and information. e.g. news stories, statements, etc. If those changes mean that the OP could trade out, good for him.<p>Another example: Let&#x27;s say NASA spots a huge asteriod in space, zooming towards earth. To pass the time, people are betting on whether or not it hits. (Let&#x27;s not worry about how the bets get paid out!) Common consensus is that there is a 10% chance of a collision, but using your awesome physics knowledge, you reckon there&#x27;s actually a 30% chance, give-or-take. So, you bet ON the asteroid hitting.<p>A few days later, a news release from an esteemed astronomer reports that her calculations show that the asteroid is more likely to collide than previously thought. As a result, betting activity on the exchange adjusts and the consensus moves to 28%. Now, you might well be tempted to trade out of your bet at this point, and &quot;lock in&quot; a profit. After all, the odds are close to your own beliefs.<p>Did you trade because of guessing the beliefs of others? No. You traded because the odds changed as a result of information changes, new info becoming public knowledge.

The result was that Google ceased doing business in the PRC, followed by a cat & mouse game where Google routed all Chinese searches through Hong Kong, which has a different legal system.<p>People like to make a lot of noise about the power of multinational corporations, but historically, when a corporation has defied a government the government usually wins.  The only exception is when there is a wide disparity in power between the corporation&#x27;s home country and the government it&#x27;s in dispute with, and the corporation&#x27;s own government backs it.  (Eg. the British East India company vs. China, Google + Facebook + Twitter vs. Egypt.)<p>The reason for this is that business requires a stable legal system to work.  Without the government&#x27;s backing, a business&#x27;s customers could simply run off with its goods & services and the business would have no legal recourse.  It becomes impossible to conduct trade when the organization with a monopoly on physical force says &quot;It&#x27;s open season on Google.&quot;  (Indeed, relations between Google and China had been frosty for several years before the shut-down because the Chinese government overtly favored Baidu, and the legal system in China is such that you can&#x27;t conduct any significant business without some bureaucrat&#x27;s say-so.)",1380827897

She actually had a bit of a bad run with entrepreneurship.  Actually her dad, who I respect for having the balls to take a punt and give it a go (about 15/20 years ago), tried and failed and the family had to to into a bit of debt which it took them years to recover from.  So from that perspective she (like many people) view risk as a 0 or 1 thing.  My way around it (almost) was to explain all actions (and risks associated with them) and having (or atleast trying to show) backup plans.  Even if it means moon lighting (which is slow and painful but much better than no support from your SO).  And giving a time frame helps and it also makes you more serious.",1279587468

For a cheap CDN, if we really had the need, we'd probably migrate to cloudfront, then come up with a task to batch resize our S3 images, then stick them back into S3.

1530766,comment,1529918,1530617,0,0,gruseom,,,"I disagree in two senses. First, it's a poor measurement of brevity that depends on identifier length. Even LOC (surely the gold standard of bad metrics) doesn't depend that much on that. Second and more interestingly, as code gets more concise, long explicit identifiers begin to detract from readability. Well-written concise code discloses valuable information just by the shape it takes. With experience reading such code, you start to grok it at a whole-expression level. Lengthy identifiers interfere with this gestalt: they provide an initial boost when reading the code, but at the long-term cost of overwhelming the code with lexical noise.<p>Concise programs often appear laughably unreadable to people who are used to a definition of ""clarity"" that derives from more verbose languages. At one time they appeared that way to me too. But with time spent working in less verbose languages, to my surprise I found myself wanting to use shorter and shorter names, not to interfere with clarity but to enhance it.",1279587011

I work for a MegaSlowGiantNotWithItCorp, and the people on top aren't stupid.  They pretend to be when they can get away with it, but they aren't really.  Plus, matters of personality, protocol, and diplomacy are where they shine.  The people attending to the AT&T executives probably memorized the names, ages, and favorite sports of Steve Jobs' kids just in case they had a chance to chat with him.  They would have, um, kind of <i>known</i> that he was a notoriously finicky control freak and narcissist with an aversion to suits.  (<i>You</i> know this, yet you assume that someone whose <i>job</i> it is to know this, and who has finagled themselves into a position working with high-level executives at one of the biggest companies in the world, would somehow not know this?)<p>Perhaps as a matter of diplomacy, just to get under his skin, they decided to insult him or pull rank on him (""my market cap is bigger than yours""), but they certainly didn't do it on accident.  And honestly I can't imagine them needing to invent ways to get under his skin when there are so many contentious issues on the table.<p><i>Even back at Dell in the early 1990s there was some friction between sales/marketing managers and engineers</i><p>That's the difference between being an engineer and being one of the most powerful and respected CEOs in the industry.<p>Plus, the 1990s were a lonnnggggg time ago.

A part of my point was more that the complexity and finickiness of the STS seem to be largely, though not completely, due to the procurement process and some peculiarities of the U.S. political structure. Parts for the STS are made everywhere by subcontractors, in order that politicians can bring jobs to their constituents, and then integrated. I think that's to what you were referring but misunderstood.<p>As to <i>mission-critical</i> parts, there is some leeway in the definition of the term that may explain the confusion. ""Mission-critical"" means, necessary for the survival of the crew and passengers. The ""mission"" is, get to the desired location if you can, but abort safely if you can't. For passenger planes, this means that if one engine goes out, the plan can land on the other one (or two or three). If the ailerons go out, the pilot can achieve roll control with rudder and throttle. If the INS goes out, the GPS can get you to a visual on a landing strip. In each of these cases, there is a single failure and <i>nobody dies</i>. Hence, these systems are not ""mission-critical"" where the ""mission"" is transporting crew and passengers without loss of life. That the plane goes somewhere specific is a fringe benefit, so to speak.<p>IIRC, the O-ring disaster had to do with the poor design and decision-making regarding temperature limits of the inadequate O-rings. Once hot combustion products get past an O-ring, there will be a failure. On a system where those hot gases can impinge on a fuel tank, there will be a catastrophic failure. On the STS, that makes those O-rings mission-critical.<p>Interestingly, some have said that the choice of Thiokol is the ultimate cause of that disaster, for precisely the reasons I talked about in my original comment. The SRBs reportedly had to be able to be shipped over the road from Thiokol's plant. In order to do so (instead of building a plant near the launch site), the boosters had to be segmented. Segments -> O-rings. That's pure rumor, afaik.",1279584626

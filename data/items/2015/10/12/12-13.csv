Let&#x27;s also not pretend that £65,000 is the average salary at Facebook UK, it&#x27;s likely much higher.<p>First of all, that&#x27;s Facebook employees paying tax. Not Facebook. That&#x27;s their money that they are taxed on and they pay it.<p>Secondly, no one is asking for Facebook to pay tax on nothing. They should pay it on profits. It was tax payers money that built the Great British Telecommunications Infrastructure that Facebook 100% depends on for it&#x27;s operations here.<p>> If I had a choice between Facebook paying £4,327 in corporation tax but employing over 350 highly skilled individuals in the UK, or relocating to somewhere like Dublin due to aggressive taxation policies. I know what I would pick.<p>No one is going to give up all the money they can earn in a country that has one of the lowest corporation tax rates in the world. Facebook is not going to convince it&#x27;s key employees to leave Britain, uproot their families and go live in the desert or china. Any threat by a company to leave one of the strongest economies in the world is a pathetic bluff.",1444654732

What I&#x27;ve seen personally is that with each increase in the tuition I experienced they were busy throwing that money at facilities and whatever else they could think up. Some of it was decent like actual improvements to aging buildings, but most of it was BS facilities like completely redoing the student center which had no real issues and been renovated barely two years earlier. It seems like the universities are following the same pattern that many hospitals have done: if they have money they must spend it even if it&#x27;s not to the benefit of its consumers or its shareholders.

I had been seeing the daily fantasy sports stuff for years after the U.S. destroyed online poker but allowed for betting on fantasy sports, but hadn&#x27;t tried it and it didn&#x27;t seem all that popular. After signing onto Draft Kings, I saw that it had obviously become extremely popular.<p>I dabbled around a bit in the NBA games and quickly saw some strategies that would likely work if tailored more. However, it was entirely clear that the way to win money in those contests would be to build a model that could spit out lineups. In the big tournaments, a model could easily create a large number of high-variance lineups. In head-to-head or smaller games, it could create lower-risk lineups.<p>I started to draw up a lot of ideas on what the model could do to try and predict things like playing time, share of points/rebounds/assists, etc.<p>When it came time to actually build it out, I shelved it, largely because it was going to take time and money to work with the type of stats I needed, but also because I&#x27;d assume there are already a lot of people on these sites doing this. In fact, I&#x27;m assuming everyone who is profitable on those sites is running model-generated lineups. There are still lots of fish pumping money in, but the people taking it out would be at least as, and likely more, sophisticated than what I could do.<p>There is an extremely popular NBA bettor and he runs a multi-million dollar operation, hiring several analysts to help him make his predictions. In fact, he&#x27;s actually consulted privately with several NBA teams because his analysis was ahead of what many NBA teams were doing several years ago.<p>If those are the types of people you&#x27;re up against, it&#x27;s a battle of algorithms, not people.",1444654578

You don&#x27;t need to create an object type out of a udev handle to order after devices or trigger hotplug events (the device node manager itself does fine, of course in the case of systemd, udev <i>is</i> part of the project, so...)<p><i>If the sequential vs. parallel startup discipline &quot;primarily affects determinism&quot; won&#x27;t all these systems have the same issues with nondeterminism?</i><p>Not necessarily. It could either be more manageable if there wasn&#x27;t so much indirection, see above (I&#x27;m afraid you just didn&#x27;t get the article, and your original summary certainly implied as much). Additionally, one could forfeit being <i>aggressively</i> parallel for a more conservative approach like in OpenRC, s6-rc or even Upstart.<p>* I don&#x27;t think anyone is seriously proposing starting up services on boot sequentially in 2015. Or even when a USB stick is inserted. Systems have 12 cores now and people can be very sensitive to boot times.*<p>Parallelism is but a small part of the complicated topic of boot time optimization. And yes, sequential strategies can still be really fast. Much of the speed increase in modern systems is not from parallelism, but forfeiting the overhead of the shell interpreter in favor of direct execution. Checkpointing can do far greater wonders for your boot times than parallelism can, anyhow.<p><i>I understand that systemd relies heavily on cgroups and other Linux-specific features for process isolation.</i><p>That&#x27;s only scratching the surface of Linux-specific features in systemd.<p><i>As it is, I would be amazed if at least one or two of the BSDs didn&#x27;t implement a similar init system to systemd in the next few years. And as it is, they probably won&#x27;t share any code or concepts, unfortunately.</i><p>What will come of the BSDs is uncertain. launchd will be used in iXsystems products like PC-BSD and FreeNAS, and there&#x27;s not much &quot;code sharing&quot; you could do there - it&#x27;s already a complete product being ported.",1444654522
10374164,comment,10373608,10373608,0,0,nevi-me,,,"From my tax knowledge, in South Africa it&#x27;s difficult to get away with paying ridiculously low amounts of tax consistently. The corporate tax rate is 28% taxed on worldwide earnings. Though you prepare returns as a single entity (i.e. each subsidiary files its returns and the holding company would also file its own return), there are transfer pricing provisions, as well as provisions for connected persons (related parties/companies) that make it difficult to just keep &#x27;profits&#x27; in Ireland without paying taxes on them.<p>If I could argue that if FB was headquartered in SA it would be paying at least 20% effective taxes, then surely the issue would be that the specific countries (US and EU) have lenient tax laws. Companies will keep gaming the system if lawmakers don&#x27;t have the appetite to ignore company lobbying and do what&#x27;s best for the income of their countries.<p>Whether the issue is that they don&#x27;t want to lose the business of these tech companies is something else. \nSouth Africa started imposing VAT on digital services sold by foreign companies last year. As a result my Google Play Music subs started costing me 14% more, funny enough as I technically shouldn&#x27;t even be having All Access as I&#x27;m in an &#x27;unsupported country&#x27;. Apple still charges me the same for music, which means someone had to take the loss to keep the value the same. Nonetheless, some people are unhappy, but our country gets to benefit with the extra 14% collected.",1444654494

Because it&#x27;s behind paywalls, or is too technical, or locked in IP, or anti-collaboration.<p>To partially address this, those of us in the US should support the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research bill[0, 1]. FASTR would essentially mandate all journal articles resulting from federally funded research to be published in an open repository online after a short embargo period, as in NIH PubMed Central.<p>To effect real change, we&#x27;ll need to see senior researchers lead the way in publishing in open journals, and there just isn&#x27;t buy-in among that crowd in some fields outside of math, physics, and CS.<p>In addition, I think researchers need to do a better job personally engaging the public regarding their research. Fully addressing the gap between researchers and the general public may well require an educational component.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.sparc.arl.org/advocacy/national/fastr/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparc.arl.org/advocacy/national/fastr/faq</a>\n1: <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/779"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/779</a>",1444651274

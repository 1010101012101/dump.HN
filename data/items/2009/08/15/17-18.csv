764976,comment,764931,764931,0,0,makecheck,,,"Speed of execution and expressiveness are common factors, and this depends on what you're doing.  For instance, regular expressions.  If you're doing a program that is primarily <i>not</i> dealing with text, but occasionally needs a regex, then Python regexes would be fine.  If the program does a lot of text processing, it should probably use Perl, due to the performance and built-in syntax.  And if the <i>entire program</i> is a simple filter, ""sed"" is even better than the Perl sledgehammer.<p>The standard library can be a big factor.  Not having to download a dependency is a big win, which is why large standard libraries such as Python can often be better than something like a CPAN dependency in Perl.  It can be the difference between using C++ or Objective-C, versus C.  But more generally, if you need to do X, and you already know how to do it with language Y, you'll need a really good reason to try a different language.",1250359170
764975,comment,764931,764931,0,0,intellectronica,,,"The most important thing when choosing a first language is to choose a language that will allow you to get stuff done as quickly as possible. The only way to learn how to program is to build stuff, and if you optimize for that, the minor differences between two languages are actually a pretty marginal factor in comparison to the advantages of getting your hands dirty and having some early successes.<p>I like Python very much and think that it's a fantastic language for building things and probably the best language for learning programming. But if, say, all your friends use Ruby, or you find that Ruby has better libraries for whatever it is you hope to be doing then I'd recommend you choose Ruby. In fact, I think PHP is an awful language and that learning is is a complete waste of time, but if you're in an environment where using PHP is the best way to get up and running, you should choose that.<p>All other things being equal, I think Python would be the best choice for you. It's a great, very versatile language, designed from the ground to be easy to learn and understand. It comes with libraries for doing pretty much anything you might want to do with a computer. It has a wonderful community - very mature and very helpful. You'll find it easy to get very high quality help learning Python.",1250359141

764970,comment,764855,764855,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"For me the whole point of buying programming books is to save time and these days fewer and fewer printed books accomplish that.<p>Before the web I used to drive 50 miles every other weekend to buy books from Computer Literacy to add to my personal library when I didn't have a need for them because of the time saved having them at hand later.  I don't do this anymore, in part because for my needs the web is often sufficient but also because Computer Literacy eventually went out of business and there's no comparable store anymore worth that trip.<p>These days I'm <i>thrilled</i> whenever I do find a printed programming book likely to save me time compared to searching the web.  The last such book I found was Kurt Jung and Aaron Brown's ""Beginning Lua Programming"".  It's full of well-organized time-saving details and an excellent companion to Roberto Ierusalimschy's ""Programming in Lua"", a book at the same quality level as K&R's ""The C Programming Language"".

People often complain that it feels worse without support (ie. barefoot) but I find it to be the opposite in my case, although after walking for an hour or more either way I do start to feel it pretty good.<p>What I'm hoping and seems to be working a bit is that walking barefoot more helps strengthen my arch and other less-used muscles in my foot and that helps eliminate this too. But I expect that's not a 100% solution and long-term I'll probably need some sort of treatment to correct the underlying cause, which is the fallen arch.<p>The shin splints were really painful though, and those are completely gone.

I like it that the author jumps straight in with the most important skill any programmer should master: Debugging.<p>Debugging is where the boys get separated from the men, for want of a better expression.

764966,comment,764812,764812,0,0,adamt,,,"I agree completely.<p>Several of my past businesses have gone through tranched rounds and each time I have found it to be significantly destructive.<p>The VCs who think financially tend to like it for several reasons:<p>* They are effectively only risking half the capital at any one time reducing their downside.\n * They are investing the second tranche later which improves their IRR\n * In their minds they think they have more control over the business.<p>The reality is, as some the linked and original blog post touch upon:<p>* The VCs expect you to grow at the same rate as though you'd raised the full amount despite the fact you've only got about 6 months worth of cash in the bank.\n * It puts loads of pressure to hit short term targets. Both on the company to the VCs and on the VC on the board to their partners. In startups things don't always go to plan (and rarely go completely to plan), and software, markets and deals always take longer.  This short-termism is a killer.\n * It means you are constantly being drip fed and having to worry about manage the shareholders rather than working together about creating a long term view. Very few tech businesses were overnight successes.<p>In my experience the net effect is considerably to the detriment to of the business, and of entrepreneur/VC relations.<p>The other thing to realise is the VC is actually getting (assuming 50:50 tranche) X/2 shares and the option to buy X/2 shares in the future if everything at the same price if everything is still peachy. Considering the pretty volatile nature of startups, a rough Black-Scholes calculation will show you're effectively discounting the shared by about 40% by tranching it in that way.  E.g. it's better to sell shares at $7 a share untranched rather than $10 tranched.",1250358737

There's lots of low-hanging fruit in the domain-specific space.<p>While designing or implementing a worthwhile Turing-complete, general-purpose programming language with a correct and efficient implementation is a huge undertaking and requires vast amounts of knowledge, doing the same for a domain-specific language is much easier because the scope is much more focused and the efficiency requirements are often not as strict.<p>As long as you focus on semantics, limit the scope of your language, use declarative techniques like pattern-matching that will let you avoid the Turing-completeness trap (Turing-completeness makes your code hard to analyse and process, unlike declarative data) and use a proper general-purpose language for the implementation, designing and implementing a domain-specific language is really not that hard, though proper IDE integration and a debugger are still not so easy to do.<p>I like to <i>make</i> the right tool for the job, so I use Common Lisp, which makes it almost ridiculously easy to invent new s-expression-based syntaxes via macros and compile through production of trees of closures, among other things.",1250358461

It is known that modern hunter-gatherers hunt and catch their pray in long distances by exhausting them, and our ancestors probably did the same. Not having fur is of great advantage in this scenario as it allows for effective cooling when sweating, while the obvious down-side is freezing at night. With the taming of fire, freezing could be avoided by staying close to the hearth, and so fur was no longer needed and we lost it.<p>I recommend ""Catching fire"" by Richard Wrangham for further investigations on how fire shaped our evolution. It's quite a good read, and a very interesting hypothesis.<p>[Edit: Gave the book's subtitle instead of the real title.]",1250356215

However, I had a molar removed under anaesthesia and I never experienced the bliss that I felt when I woke up. I guess something in the drugs must have triggered it. When you disconnect the brain from the 'sensors' or when is 'shutting down' all these mysterious effects are experienced. I had an uncle that had a Near Death Experience, he had no reason to lie to anyone about it. He described everything that happened in the morgue (they took him there). I took the trouble to go and speak to some of the medics and they confirmed what happened.<p>Ever since Carl Sagan proposed that people with NDE are perhaps re-experiencing their birth, I am more awed with neuro-science. The highly logical hacker in me is always looking for a physical explanation where either my left or right brain remains open and agnostic!<p>The beauty of the article is that it comes from a person in the field, but so was Teller and he was duped by Uri Geller.",1250356176

I've read in the guidelines that submitting multiple ideas is acceptable, and even preferred. It's also clear the majority of accepted startups are product-oriented (I'm considering automated subscriptions to a web service a product in this case), rather than service-oriented.<p>My company is following the Guy Kawasaki method of offering services/consulting to generate immediate cash flow, while working on product-driven solutions in the background. I strongly believe the product I'm currently working on will succeed, though I don't believe it will ever be a good acquisition candidate for Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc. I'm wondering how important that is for acceptance into Y Combinator.<p>Even the services I'm offering have an extra entrepreneurial twist. With a nod towards Anomaly (<a href=""http://anomaly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anomaly.com/</a>), I have one carefully-screened client with whom I'm essentially working for equity rather than cash. Thus far I've been impressed by his performance and contributions to the project.<p>In summary, I'm hoping that someone here will evaluate what I've written and respond with a convincing argument for why I should:\nA. Apply with my 'big picture' vision, incorporating most or all of the above - keeping my fingers crossed that what is essentially an agency with multiple business models has a chance at acceptance\nB. Apply with total focus on the app - even though it's not a good acquisition candidate\nC. Wait to apply until I have a product-driven idea that is a good acquisition candidate<p>Thank you in advance for any light to be shed. I hope my questions possess some semblance of universal applicability.",1250356111

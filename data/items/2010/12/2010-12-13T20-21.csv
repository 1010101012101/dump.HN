2001934,comment,2000660,2001352,0,0,makmanalp,,,"I agree with all of this, but what bothers me is that the record industry is using a form of reverse pie fallacy in which they claim that they would have had X amount of sales, if only those darned pirates hadn't stolen the music. A more sophisticated (but still fallacious) version goes: Album Y has been pirated Z times, therefore we lost Z * (retail price of the album).<p>This is blatantly wrong. They do not know that they would have sold X albums if it weren't for pirates. Furthermore, if a person pirates an album, it does <i>not</i> mean that they would have bought it if they couldn't pirate it or if they were more ethical.<p>The people I know who horde large amounts of music do it exactly because it doesn't cost them - if they had to pay for it they simply wouldn't have even close to that much music. They wouldn't go and buy all the same albums. They also wouldn't be enthusiasts at that scale.<p>tl;dr: Fallacies exist on both sides.",1292273948

Bees are important pollinators but there are other pollinators and the case that the absence of honey bees would result in the absence of 1/3 of crop production is very weak, since the absence of competition from honey bees would likely result in some degree of compensation from other pollinator species (such as wasps).<p>The 2nd reference is the best so far, it provides some quantitative information about how dominant the honey bee is as a pollinator of commercial crops.<p>Personally I think bees are hugely important and it's quite sad the way bee populations have been mistreated, but it doesn't help to overstate the case (the case for being kind to bees is already very strong).",1292273682

It has been for a very long time.  The digital revolution is just putting the final nails in the coffin.<p>But even before filesharing on the internet, artists were getting screwed left and right, and very very few could make a living creating art.<p>Now it's clearer than ever that we have to find some other ways to compensate artists for the work they do.  Some suggestions that I've heard along these lines are:<p><pre><code>  - Put a PayPal (or choose your favorite non-evil payment system) icon
    prominently on your home page and ask for donations.

  - Release your music for free, but ask for money
    so that you can work on your next album.  Don't release
    your next album until you've gotten enough of a payment
    to make it worthwhile.  If you're good and have developed
    a large enough fan base, this should be quite
    a reasonable business model.

  - Give away the music for free, but charge for
    live appearances (make money touring).

  - Make it clear to your fans that you are giving away 
    your music for free, but need them to chip in by buying
    tangible merchandise like t-shirts.
</code></pre>
Ok.  None of these are perfect.  And they all work best when the artist is already well known and has a large fan base.  But relatively unknown artists have always struggled to get by, and filesharing does not change that equation.<p>At least with all of the suggested payment methods above, the artist gets to keep a lion's share of the profit, instead of begging for pennies on the dollar when going through the established record company system.",1292271288

  - Deal with foreign nations
  - Deliver the mail
  - Run a patent/copyright system
  - Manage the military (standing navy, but the army is supposed to be justified every two years)
  - Govern Washington DC
</code></pre>
Section 9 puts limits and boundaries on the powers of congress.<p>Section 10 says that the states can't do the things Congress is responsible for.<p>Article II is about the president. The only real power he has is to be commander in chief of the military and to negotiate treaties. There's no new power here; the president is just in charge of a couple of items from Section 8.<p>Article III sets up the supreme court. No particular powers are granted here, just some definition of the responsibilities of the highest court.<p>There is nothing in here about ""most"" powers being granted (not reserved) to the Federal government. Most of the power was still with the states, who were responsible for their own internal governance and who influenced the Federal government through their Senators. The earlier federal governments were weaker than the one set up by the Constitution, but the Constitution did not establish a strong central government. The states were still largely independent, self-sufficient, and self-governing, and only gave up rights related to how they interacted with each other, other nations, and the scope of their military's.<p>I wouldn't say that States actively resist guidelines and best practices; I'd say they resist unfunded mandates. And the real point is that they're supposed to be able to resist. They're supposed to be self-governed and independent, and if the Federal government tries to tell the States to do something that is outside of the Fed's powers to dictate, the States should resist unless it happens to be a really good idea.",1292271199

Would the solution be to partner with a business person? Maybe, but how would you go about finding that person? They should be someone with knowledge and relationships in the particular business area (here, retailers), and yet it seems most of the successful business partnerships seem to have been between people who knew each other for a while (e.g. college friends, etc), probably because trust is essential. And yet in that case, it seems very difficult to find a matching relationship between the people involved and the ""business idea"" / ""epiphany"".<p>It would be interesting to learn about how an engineer can learn more about the business-side of things, and how to successfully partner with business people.",1292271021

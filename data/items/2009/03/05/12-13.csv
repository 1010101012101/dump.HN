(I think this came second only to ""proprietary encryption is crap."")<p>The first trick, in particular, seems pretty useless, unless I'm missing something.  The second one is probably slightly more useful, but won't stop a determined black hat (it doesn't feel right to say 'hacker' on HN, even in context).<p>If someone is dedicated to gaining access to your machine, and has the skill and knowledge to do so, then, in general, a little extra obfuscation will annoy them but not stop them.  The only potential benefit of this kind of obfuscation that I can see is that it could shut down script kiddies who don't really know what they're doing.  But if you want reliable, provable security, don't rely on tricks like this.",1236257570

Critics of H1B note that it's not actually a skills problem, it's that you can pay an H1B with the <i>same</i> skills less and treat them worse because the threat of deportation hangs over them if they lose their job.<p>The solution is, if you have X skillset and have been paid at least Y dollars for Z years in your home country (to prove experience), have a visa that isn't bound to a particular employer, and also here is a defined process for getting a green card before that visa expires should you want one.",1236257080

At least a few paragraphs are needed if the article isn't very short.<p>A mouseover might not be the best way, maybe a hidden div beneath the current metadata?",1236256730

But...<p>""I think your only true protection against getting burned again is to deeply face what it is in yourself that created those painful situations in the first place.""<p>That's... not really true. The rest of your advice is sound and good, but there are bad people in the world that do bad things. There's also normal people, and between normal people, there's friction. Almost everyone I know who is successful in business has been burned a couple times, and you just need to learn from it. Certainly the original poster did some things wrong via contracts, relationships, etc, but it's also quite possible that he was just dealing with some rat bastards. There's a lot of them in the world, and unfortunately, you usually start by working with them. Established people typically only work with people with a great track record, so when you don't have one, you're usually working with someone else who doesn't have one. So you've got a 1 in whatever chance that a random person is a donkey chance that you're working with a donkey.",1236256567

Contracts typically aren't worth the paper they're printed on - where you're at in life right now, you're not going to go to court if you fall out with someone. Contracts protect you a bit if you're further along, but a contract isn't worth a damn thing without a good relationship and clear expectations. The most important thing a contract can do is to lay out clearly, in writing, what you both expect to do and have roles set up. But so many of your assumptions will likely be wrong that you might have to redraw some elements of it over time. It happens - but getting down who does what, when, where, and how they're measured is huge. A basic operating agreement goes a long way. Check out E-Myth, it reads fast. Probably my favorite book on small business ever.",1236256306

504185,comment,503422,503983,0,0,gjm11,,,"Opinion on these synopses seems to be strongly divided. Sometimes they get lots of upvotes and ""that was helpful"" replies. Sometimes they get snide comments about what a waste of time they are and how their authors are just looking for cheap karma. There doesn't seem to be much correlation between which of those happens and how helpful the synopsis actually is.<p>I think having two different voting mechanisms would cause more confusion than the benefit would justify. What about showing the first bit of (1) the original author's text, where present, or (2) the highest-rated toplevel comment, as a mouseover? Even when the highest-rated comment isn't ""representative"", it probably gives some idea of what the article is about.",1236255371

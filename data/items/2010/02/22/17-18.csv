These apps were overwhelming the already terrible app store so much that they often appeared 5+ times in the top 25.",1266861446

1143243,comment,1141235,1142541,0,0,sailormoon,,,"I think I didn't explain myself well. I actually proposed that the ""king"" be democratically elected, so instead of hundreds of bickering congressmen, he would have largely unfettered power to then make decisions as he saw fit. The one thing he could not influence, at all, would be the process by which the cycle continued fairly after four years.<p>I don't see how that's all that different than today in terms of risk of executive takeover. I mean in theory the president could stage a military coup and declare himself dictator for life tomorrow. And the legislative branch could vote in measures by which it could be exceedingly difficult to remove the currently sitting members.<p>It was just a thought experiment, vary at your pleasure. How about dramatically reducing the number of legislators to, say, 12? Would that really be much worse? It's still democracy, just a different spin on it.<p>Seems like most of the arguments for our current implementation of democracy are a variation on the notion that government is so inefficient and bloated it can't act decisively on anything, thus reducing the likelihood of bad decisions (while of course throwing out the baby with the bathwater - no good ones, either). Well, that's a pretty lame defense.<p>All this talk about defending fascism etc is just wild extrapolation from what I said.",1266861325

There are sharp divisions: the use of tools, the understanding of death, the use of language, the use of language to describe abstract concepts, the use of oral history, the use of written history, the creation of artificial intelligence aides, etc.<p>I absolutely agree that having a bigger picture than just ""people are special"" is a prerequisite for first contact, I just also think that going to the other extreme, that all intelligences are mostly the same, is probably much worse than just having a human-bias.

I have had people claim to be experienced that had no clue how to do even very basic programming, just as described in this article.  Even more common, I have had people that grossly exaggerate their skills and experience.  One that stuck with me was someone who was a ""senior DBA"" but when I probed further it turned out he mostly ran stored procedures written by consultants and didn't really have the knowledge right then to do much more than that.<p>I would also like to point out that if you are up front about your lack of skills and applying for an entry level post, it can work out.  I had one interviewee who had no programming skills, but was ready and willing to learn.  She was up front about it, convinced the whole team of her sincerity, and willing to start for less than most people with a CS degree.  By the end of her 3 month probationary period, she was competent.  Still junior and with a lot to learn of course, but quite competent and a good hire overall.",1266861213

Is it from users of your site? Is it from Amazon or something like that? I like to know where data's from so that I can make some judgement as to whether I want to disregard it. Data with no source definitely gets disregarded :)<p>* What am I supposed to do on your site? Just look for books and then follow links to buy them? Or can I rate books?<p>* Why are you basing the whole experience off of gender? I don't see why it's particularly useful to know what other men like, or what women like. I'd rather know what people like me like. i.e. like the whole Netflix recommendations thing. This just seems like a one-dimensional version of that?",1266858486

When Tchaikovsky asked two of the greatest violinists of his day to play his violin concerto, they refused, deeming the score unplayable (Platt, 1966). Today, elite violinists consider this concerto part of the standard repertory. The improvement in music training is so great that according to Roth (1982) the violin virtuoso Paganini ""would indeed cut a sorry figure is placed upon the modern concert stage"" (p. 23).""

1143100,comment,1142398,1142398,0,0,geebee,,,"I think this article does a good job covering the second best way of selecting programmers - the technical job interview.<p>The best ""interviews"" aren't really interviews, though, they're recruiting sessions.  A really strong, experienced software development manager who plans to employ programmers should have 1) a strong background in programming, and 2) a strong network of programmers who would jump at the chance to work with him again.<p>You already know your potential hires are good programmers, because you've worked with them before - in school, on side projects, at work, in various collaborations.  You don't need to ask them to print all the nodes in a binary tree, and if you did, well, you'd probably lose the candidate.<p>I think Joel (on software) put it this way (I'm paraphrasing): if you're a small independent film maker, and Uma Thurman expresses an interest in your movie, you don't ask her to audition, you ask what you can do to get her on board. I think 37Signals is another example of a company that mainly recruits people they already know through programming projects (esp contributions to rails).<p>I won't say the technical interview is evidence of a ""broken"" recruiting system the way some people do, because let's face it, we don't all have the recruiting mystique to wave the magic wand and get top people to join us, and our networks just aren't big enough.  So we <i>have</i> to interview relative unknowns.<p>But I will readily admit that this shows that I'm not doing it the best way.  This goes both ways.  If I'm in an interview and people start asking me how to implement a singleton, I start to wonder if I'm going about my job search the wrong way.  If I have to ask the candidate this, then maybe I'm going about the recruitment in the wrong way as well.<p>But if that's your reality, then yeah, make sure you screen well.",1266858317

Not all of the rules were accepted, and the ones that were are now being challenged in court by the Telcos. It is rumored that FCC chairman Kevin Martin is now working on a proposal to at least partially reverse some of the open standards that were ratified, in response to the Telco's uproar. It is not looking good... Despite this, Google has publically stated that they will ""most likely"" still bid in the auction.<p>I have read of at least one analyst who believes that the Telcos are more likely to win the auction than Google. Possibly out right by a single carrier or through collusion between multiple. As much cash as Google has, It could be difficult for them to justify spending >$10B on a wireless spectrum when they are still perceived as an internet search company. Investors may not be very happy about that. For the Telcos, this is their core business and the expense is highly justified. While this is all speculation at this point, the consensus so far does not paint a very pretty picture for open access unfortunately. We will just have to wait a few more months and see how things play out.",1191221932

As a project to just have fun, of course it is a cool idea.<p>Lisp systems moved to generic functions for a reason - Lisp dialects for some time used a Smalltalk-based message sending model, but it just isn't as flexible.<p>But if the desire is to get Ruby semantics with Lisp syntax, I think the much more reasonable approach is to run a Rubyesque Lisp on Rubinius (which the lead devs have already talked of doing). At least by doing that you get the advantage of piggybacking on an advancing VM and a language that already has libraries.<p>Establishing a new language is hard.\n",1191220703

61510,comment,61456,61456,0,0,neilc,,,"""The Zenter duo invested a few months of their lives in non-stop hacking with the goal of winning over Google, and they did. Grand prize? Engineering jobs at Google!""<p>That sounds like a pretty good deal to me. The Zenter guys spent 6 months building their product before they got bought. I have no idea what the purchase price was, but let's take a wild-assed guess and say both founders made $1 million in Google stock. They ended up with jobs at Google, which is probably the best of the big technology companies to work at, plus the chance to see the stuff they'd developed used by millions of people as an eventual component of GDocs. So on the whole, I think they did pretty well for 6 months of work, and fairly limited risk.<p>The alternative? If they rolled the dice and tried to make an independent company out of it, there's no guarantee they wouldn't just be crushed by GDocs adding presentations 6 months down the line. They hadn't even <i>launched</i> yet, let alone demonstrated they could build a profitable business.<p>If anything, I think the lesson to be learned is that if you're in Zenter's shoes, that would be a hard offer to turn down.",1191219814

Thankfully, I'm not rich (yet) so the FDIC will ensure that I don't lose any money.<p>Potentially very painful lesson learned: Yes, banks can go out of business. FDIC only covers you up to $100,000 if this happens. When you get rich with your startup, keep your money stuffed in your mattress.",1191219651

And the companies involved have been known to enforce those patents. Hence linux stays away (for the moment). Although it seems like with newer distros it is getting easier to turn this stuff on (but it is still up to you, and isn't a easy setting as yet). <p>Thats about all I know about it. <p>\n",1191219060

61503,comment,61157,61270,0,0,altay,,,"The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, in a nutshell, is ""language influences thought.""  The classic debunking example is the urban legend, ""Eskimos have over a hundred words for 'snow.'""  This is often overextended to imply, ""...and so Eskimos must conceive of snow on a whole 'nother <i>level</i>, dude!""  <p>But our non-Eskimo language doesn't fundamentally limit our capacity to comprehend the nuances of snow.  We just add modifiers (e.g., 'wet' and 'fluffy') to ""snow"", instead of using a different word.  And, actually, it turns out the Eskimos use modifiers, too.<p><i>The Language Instinct</i> is a great read.  Pinker's got a real talent for popular science writing that's accessible but not dumbed down.  Check out his first hit, <i>How the Mind Works</i>, if you're interested in general cognitive science. \n",1191218423

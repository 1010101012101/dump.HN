3466899,comment,3465102,3465595,4,0,nagrom,,,"I disagree. He's British, and allegedly committed a crime in Britain, against British law. He should be tried and, if found guilty, punished in Britain. Why is that not happening?<p>It may be the case that he has also committed a crime in the US. If Britain feels that the crime he is supposed to have committed in the US is heinous enough in nature to extradite him, then the proper procedures should be followed of course. However, if the crime is not heinous enough to cause a prosecution of him in Britain, it is not heinous enough to extradite him to the US.<p>In Thailand, I believe it is illegal to insult the person of the King. If someone in the UK insults the Thai king on the internet in a racially-aggravated way (and funding the site via advertisements), but not heinously enough to cause a prosecution in the UK, should they be extradited to Thailand to face prosecution there? I'd argue that they shouldn't and that this fictitious case is almost identical in nature to the one under discussion.<p>Your allegory is flawed (I believe) as I cannot imagine how one could facilitate copyright violation for pirating CDs remotely, in a way that is <i>merely</i> speech and is illegal in the host country and would cause extradition to face prosecution. Can you fill that detail in for me?<p>(The idea that there is a crime of <i>facilitating copyright violation</i> is nauseating, by the way. That's similar to the UK's offence of <i>possessing information that may be of use to a terrorist</i>. In practice, almost anything can be outlawed that way; the law is so broad as to be useless for punishing any single offence and capable of punishing <i>any</i> offence.)",1326624986

Some people paint with dots only and some people express themselves in line art. If they allowed themselves any imaginable method that is applicable, they wouldn't be doing art. They could just take a photograph of a setting, and that photograph wouldn't say a thing to anyone.<p>Endless bit-twiddling and struct packing may turn trivial methods into huge optimization-ridden hacks and not get you too far vertically but given only few resources, those hacks are required to turn the theoretic approach into a real application that you can actually do useful work with. Those hacks often exhibit ingenious thinking and many examples of that approach art—and the best definitely are. And any field where ingenious thinking is required will push the whole field forward.<p>Similarly, for example, using a Python set as a rudimentary spell-checker is fast, easy, and convenient but it's no hack because it requires no hacking.

None.<p>The bleeding edge has simply moved and it must lie somewhere these days, of course. Maybe computer graphics—although it has always demonstrated the capability to lead the bleeding edge so there's actually no news there. The fact is that the bleeding edge is more scattered. Early on, every computer user could feel and sense the bleeding edge because it revolved around tasks so basic that you could actually measure with your own eyes. Similarly, even a newbie programmer would face the same limitations early on and learn about how others had done it. Now you can stash gigabytes of data into your heap without realizing that you did, and wonder why the computer felt sluggish for a few seconds. Or how would you compare two state of the art photorealistic, interactive real-time 3D graphics demos?

Both iOS 5 and Windows Phone 7 have completely different APIs. If you add a new feature to one of the applications, it is not available on the other system. For every new operating system, you need to split your work. And your customers get an inconsistent and incompatible experience of your app across the different versions.<p>This is fragmentation.<p>From the ~100 different mobile operating systems that are in use today, maybe 95 can be targeted by a single code base, because they are all compatible with a common platform: Android 2.1 Eclair.<p>You still have to consider the many different hardware configurations. But most of the work of porting your application from one system to another is gone.<p>iOS and Windows Phone are complete end user operating systems, which are both made for a very specific hardware configuration and user experience. Android is a cross platform foundation that you can use to build those kinds of operating systems on.<p>Is there a common application platform for both iOS and Windows Phone, and how often is it updated?<p>The answer is: Yes, the web is such a platform. And it usually takes many years until an update is universally installed on all systems.",1326622058

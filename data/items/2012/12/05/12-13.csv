Ask them to speak to you only in their native language. Listen to their music and watch their TV and films. Read their books - above all children's books.<p>In my first four weeks in Germany I did a 4-week 'intensive' course that covered enough basic grammar and vocabulary to stumble through a one-on-one conversation with a lot of pointing.<p>After that I never looked at another vocab sheet. I could feel my brain soaking up the language day after day; I'd reach out for a word I'd never learned or a phrase I'd never used and find one waiting.<p>Obviously not everyone has the opportunity to immerse themselves in a foreign culture for twelve months, but if you do then just take it - time spent learning the language before you go is probably inefficiently spent if not outright wasted.",1354709972

4875936,comment,4873705,4873705,14,0,michaelochurch,,,"I'm going to inflict some blistering cynicism on this thread.<p>You don't succeed in most environments based on whether or not you're <i>productive</i>, competent, or expert at what you do. None of that <i>really</i> matters once a company gets to the point where decisions are no longer being made by technical people.<p>So, you have to suffer. You have to deal with the meetings and the social expectations. Most developers work in an environment where availability matters more than excellence. In at 9:45, when the boss is in at 9:30? Stee-rike one! Miss the daily standup? Stee-rike two!<p>There is a positive spin you can put on it. Most companies won't actually <i>fire</i> you for skipping those meetings. They're mandatory, but not <i>that</i> mandatory. However, you'll just end up increasingly out of the loop and with a negative reputation... and eventually lose your job, but it will take a long time-- possibly 6 to 12 months, and certainly long enough to get another one. Attending that 15-minute status meeting rather than skipping it probably has as much of an impact on your political standing (and, thus, career) as a 2-hour swing in the overall length of your day. So the efficiency ratio of that meeting to normal ass-in-chair time is 8-to-1. No, it's not what you'd like to be doing with your time, but it's work, and most people deal with a lot worse than status meetings.<p>The game in most places isn't about getting the most done, or getting into flow and building great software. It's about creating an image so that managerial types, many of whom operate on antiquated emotional metrics of availability and subordination, feel confident in you. It's a game to be played, not a meritocracy.",1354709948
4875935,comment,4873542,4874399,12,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> American manufacturing will return.<p>It never left. The US manufacturing output steadily increased from the 50's to the recent recession. Right now, it is at an all time high. The idea of american manufacturing being shipped overseas is just <i>false</i>, and I'm sick of people repeating it.<p>What happened is that as wages got expensive, US labor was replaced by machines where possible, and by some cheap process steps overseas where not possible. Intel CPUs are a good example: They used to be made wholly in the US, employing a lot of blue-collar workers. To save costs, the factories were automated to the point where the only process steps left that employ a lot of people without advanced degrees are packaging and testing. And then those were shipped to Malaysia and Costa Rica. The high-capital process steps that create most of the value in the system are still in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico.<p>Manufacturing jobs, as they used to be, are <i>gone</i>. Not because of globalization, but because of robots. And the old kind of manufacturing jobs will never return -- it just doesn't make sense to pay people $30 a hour for what could be done faster, cheaper and better by a robot.",1354709898

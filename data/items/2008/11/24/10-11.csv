We have like what, 50 guys on my school's cross country team. 40 are Asian, but 5/10 of the caucasian guys to the best out of the 50. They get injured less, even if they aren't as good early on for some strange reason. They also improve faster.<p>Though you have to admit, with all that video game playing, it's no small wonder that asians are pretty decent at baseball.",1227523813

374668,comment,374529,374655,0,0,timknauf,,,"Interesting. I hadn't come across that idiom before. In Python, you'll have things like:<p><pre><code>  myLongList = [1, 2, 3,\n                4, 5, 6,\n                7, 8, 9]\n</code></pre>\nNo continuation character is needed, because the continuation is implied.<p>However, I can't think of a direct parallel to your example above. It looks handy. What API/language are you alluding to?<p>I guess the Pythonic way would be something like:<p><pre><code>  win = Window(title = ""A new window"",\n               foreground = ""Red"",\n               background = ""White"",\n               menuBar = [fileMenu, viewMenu, helpMenu])\n</code></pre>\nBut I disgress. :^)",1227523512

I've been around since about a year after its inception, and like Paul said, people have always complained that quality was going down.<p>But honestly, it has stayed about the same. Sure, once in a while some trollish post gets to the front page, but the mods tackle it or people flag it or upvote other things within a day. The signal to noise ratio is just really high, and unless that's going down drastically, I don't see a problem.<p>Come back the day HN becomes Digg, because I don't think it'll happen...for a long long time at any rate.<p>Growth is good.

374659,comment,374529,374529,0,0,timknauf,,,"Thanks for the responses, everyone! Sounds like - regardless of what I might think of semicolons personally - the reality of the current crop of minifiers and JavaScript engines makes a case for their continued use.<p>Now, how about ActionScript? This has a compilation step, so the Flash VM is not dealing with your code directly. If we discount ActionScript obfuscators, could a stronger case be made for omitting semicolons there?",1227522994

374656,comment,373900,374501,0,0,patio11,,,"Here are the results of my experiment, as promised.<p>Here's my little mini-site:<p><a href=""http://www.christmasbingocards.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.christmasbingocards.com</a><p>This is a holiday promotion aimed at my customers.  They're overwhelmingly non-technical folks, and not too sophisticated at the Internet.  (I am well-aware that most people here would not purchase my software.  I'm totally OK with that: you are not the audience.)<p>I asked the Turkers three questions (and will tell you my rationales):<p>1) Is it IMMEDIATELY clear what the site offers when you open it?   [Rationale: This site is a sledgehammer, not a scalpel.  I want them to understand what it offers before they hit their back button.  If thought is required, I failed at design.]<p>2) Try to print out Christmas bingo cards. Tell me how long it takes you from me giving you that instruction to something coming out from your printer.  [Rationale: My target is that fourty-something mother with kids, with no special computer skills, can accomplish this in 90 seconds.  There is actually a bit of an overlap between Turkers and my market.]<p>3) If you thought your friends would find Christmas bingo to be a fun activity, would you recommend this site for it to them? Why or why not?  [Rationale: The Turking population has a significant overlap with my core audience.  Why not ask a quick thumbs up/down?]<p>What it taught me:<p>1)  The site achieves its singular purpose fairly well.\n2)  It is attractive enough to move several testers into mentioning it to their friends.  (As in, not hypothetical.)<p>The feedback lets me know ""OK, the site is basically OK and needs to be built-out more than rethought from scratch"".  Knowing that, and the peace of mind from knowing that, are worth $7 to me easily.  I hope this service continues getting developed, because I can see a lot of uses for it in my business.<p>(Yeah, I could roll my own with the Turk API... but I value my time at $100 an hour.  This means I never want to be playing the sit-at-computer-refreshing-Amazon-so-I-can-authorize-fourty-cent-payment game.)",1227522614
374655,comment,374529,374612,0,0,cabalamat,,,"I agree. You often get multi-line statements and in many languages/APIs they're a nature way of doing things.

Prefixing product names with the company name ensures trademark uniqueness and reduces customer confusion. However, Microsoft seems to insist on hierarchical branding namespaces which preserves the trademark uniqueness, but increases confusion.<p>Is it Microsoft Office Word?

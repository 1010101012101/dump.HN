1491973,comment,1491783,1491783,0,0,gte910h,,,"I don't think gaming company employees get that gaming is stigmatized by non-gamers, especially time consuming forms like MMOs. It isn't stigmatized by them.<p>Friends of mine who play one of the Blizzard games (World of Warcraft) and work at a (non-MMO, console based) game company don't understand that everyone else views gaming, especially PC gaming, as a non-legitimate hobby and a questionable mark against you on a job search, funding search, or anything of the sort really.<p>It's not like religion, race, political affiliation. It's a very legitimate concern, as there is a tendency for people who play these games to stay up much of the night instead of getting a proper nights rest. They don't understand how much they're giving up people's privacy; lots of users will stop playing these games for professional reasons. The bank vice president: Gone. The guy running a business: Gone. The advertising exec: Gone. None of them can afford to have this come out professionally.",1278442786

Knowing the names for bits of a sentence is different from being able to comprehend a sentence.  You might know what an adverbal phrase is, without knowing the name for it.  To say otherwise suggests the strong form of Sapir-Worf, which is generally discredited (while still actually being contentious).<p>This article isn't even talking about the ability to name the different grammatical components, though.  It seems to be talking about comprehension of sentence forms.  There is a hint that using ""every"" can sometimes be misinterpreted.<p>But we see that linguistic shift anyway.  Things like ""I could care less"" are regarded as conveying the speaker's meaning, while the linguistic analysis of the form suggests a meaning opposite to that normally inferred, or implied.<p>""Every"" is frequently misplaced, and people seem to assume they know what the speaker means.  Following logical analyses we often find that the speaker didn't actually say what they meant, and the listener understood something different again.",1278442095

1491916,comment,1491494,1491678,0,0,ktsmith,,,"Team teaching is still around. My wife, for example, team taught for two years. The school she has been at for the last five years has had at least two teams each year typically at the second and third grade level. She was at an older school that had very large class rooms which made it possible. Most of the newer schools in my area have no team teaching because the classrooms are simply too small to accomodate two full classrooms of children.<p>As far as empirical evidence on the smaller class room sizes, can't really say much about it. I'll provide a couple of anecdotes from my wife's experience. Larger classroom sizes make it significantly harder to provide personalized help to students during the day, this can be a serious problem if those students don't have anyone at home that can or will help them. At the school my wife has spent the last five years at a good portion of the parents were illiterate and couldn't provide any help to their children though many of them wanted to. Additionally larger classroom sizes can mean significantly more of the teachers personal time (off contract) must be spent on prep, grading, conferences, etc. That was something we had to deal with and significantly impacted our personal lives.<p>One problem with trying to measure the effect of classroom size changes are that they are not the only change being made. Schools change curriculum, lunches, teaching styles and everything else. Some measurements also need to be done over many years. For example, locally about six years ago all day kindergarten was implemented in poorer areas and where second language learners were prevalent. The students that started in that program and were immersed in school activities and english language activities all day just finished fifth grade. Across the board there have been significant improvements in test scores with that group (math scores have been decent, specifically the reading/writing scores went up a large amount). Due to budget issues all day kindergarten is being cut. The reason being that there's no ""empirical evidence that all day kindergartens were the cause of the increased performance on test scores."" I'm paraphrasing, but it's a common issue in how education is measured and tracked.",1278441769

They performed an experiment that showed that having a single security guard patrol the parking lot at night completely eliminated crime (mugging, car break-ins, etc. that occur with regularity in Wal-Mart parking lots), but they did not put it into effect to save what? $75,000 per year?

The fact that people prefer to borrow from Lisp rather that adopt it is telling. Many programmers are aware enough of Lisp to take inspiration from it but choose not to use the language itself.<p>There's a subtext of arrogance in the claims FP and Lisp advocates make about the popularity of various programming languages. In my experience most of those people don't actually write much code. I gave up on the Common Lisp community years ago after realizing that it was full of people that would rather sit around discussing how things <i>should</i> be than actually building something.<p>Clay Shirky talks about people knocking out an important app in 2 days PHP here:\n<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_w...</a><p>I doubt very much that the typical Lisp crowd would have gotten past arguing which web templating library to use.",1278439332

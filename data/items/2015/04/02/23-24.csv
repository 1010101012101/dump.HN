And hopefully have better luck with it, since they have access to many new and old games.<p>The idea behind cloud gaming has many advantages, for things like instantly trying demos, to playing old school games that aren&#x27;t even available on your platform, gaming on MacBook Airs, etc.<p>I was a huge fan of OnLive in the beginning, but given that the service was semi-dead the last few years (no new games), I hope its tech will be better utilized by Sony.",1428019147

The problem that&#x27;s being described was prevalent when threads were being created manually too.  Like anything else, the tool needs to be matched to the job.  We processed about 32E9 pieces of telemetry per day ... our parallel threads were normalizing and aggregating that data as well as preparing it for storage.<p>If you have too many threads waiting, you&#x27;ve got too many threads.  I did a significant amount of testing using threads (on a project I can&#x27;t share) and found that generically, you should have n + 1 threads when you have n processor cores.  If your processor I/O bandwidth is limited, you may find better performance with less processors.<p>If you&#x27;re creating something like a tick-store (Michael Stonebraker - newest Turing award winner), you&#x27;ll need to tune the rest of the system to feed the processors data at the maximum rate too.  We were using E15K (and another bigger machine I can&#x27;t remember) and used processor affinity to make sure all but 3 of the processors were dedicated to parallel threads.  The thread count was the number of dedicated processors plus one.<p>Having too many threads leads to context churn ... think about what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish and design the system appropriately.

As you&#x27;ve seen in the post, other people have similar requirements (text editor, selection retrieval, etc.) and similar desire for keeping `innerText`.<p>> Pulling large chunks of plain text as a string to process for any low latency tasks constrains the size of text you can reasonably work with. JS strings are immutable as well, that&#x27;s a lot of copying.<p>Pulling large chunks of plain text — that&#x27;s a plausible argument, but no different than pulling, say, `innerHTML` (large chunk) or `textContent` (large chunk) or really anything else in JS land (which if often full of strings — JSON, templates, whatever).<p>> Another issue is this whole handling of converting lists and tables to some kind of plain text markup. Is that a two translation? Are tabs going to turn into table elements if I have them in a string and set innerText? That seems pretty crazy, but not doing so would just make it very weirdly asymmetrical.<p>That&#x27;s a very good point! But don&#x27;t forget that we already have a standard way of setting element contents from plain text — `textContent`. Yes, innerText setting would have to be assymetrical; I doubt anyone would want to go down the rabbit hole of backwards conversion. Everyone usually agrees that when it comes to setting, `innerText` should simply act like `textContent` (to quote spec: &quot;on setting, no parsing is performed either, the input string is taken as pure textual content.&quot;)<p>> How much horribly slower do you want the DOM to be?\nWell, as app devs, we still need to implement plain text retrieval. By not having it natively in Mozilla, the joke is really on the users — more strings (in JS land), more DOM iteration, more everything. How is that for a &quot;slow DOM&quot;? ;)",1428017738

If the developers of actual cartridges were allowed to make use of that trick, why shouldn&#x27;t modern day retroprogrammers have that option?<p>But if a retroprogrammer were to use a mapper to achieve a 1 meg ROM, modern hardware would make that a decision with very little negative consequences. A programmer at the time might have to live with a game that cost well over $100.<p>So cheating in quotes because people did it in their actual cartridges. Cheating without quotes would be something like breaking out of the emulator sandbox and embedding the Quake engine.",1428016417

That&#x27;s unfortunately not their last mistake, as it seems then also want to extend this to an idea that other copyrightable works should be gratis, too.<p>The Software Freedoms [0] don&#x27;t mean you get to scarper off with other people&#x27;s hard work. They mean that, once you have paid and received permission to use the work, you shouldn&#x27;t be restricted in your use of the work.<p>Software is a thing that we use to get work done, a thing that doesn&#x27;t necessarily work <i>correctly</i> or <i>sufficiently</i> or whatever other reason you might want to change it. We have a need to protect the rights of users because, without said rights, the user could potentially end up in a situation where their livelihood is significantly impacted by the failing software.<p>A work of <i>art</i>, on the other hand, is meant for consumption. You can&#x27;t make a photo so integral to your workflow that replacing it with another photo could be detrimental to your self. Most programs are not reasonable substitutes for each other. Most photos of bumblebees are--more or less--perfectly acceptable substitutes, not because all photographers are equivalent and interchangeable, but because your need to have that photo is not more important than the photographer&#x27;s need to eat.<p>The Software Freedoms are not about copyright. Copyright is just the mechanism through which the GPL operates, in an ideology that believes that software should not be copyrightable. It&#x27;s the belief that these two things are so fundamentally different, that copyright is not the appropriate means to protect software developers, that led to the creation of the GPL. The GPL is nothing more than a hack on top of the copyright system to make copyright--for software--useless. It is not an overall indictment of copyright.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>",1428016178

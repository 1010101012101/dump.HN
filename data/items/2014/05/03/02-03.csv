Because honestly, if the future of Rust is to look like this, that would be somewhat horrifying.<p>Python is a great language for beginners and people who get into programming through nontraditional channels without having much of a symbol-pushing background; presumably, being able to parse symbolic expressions naturally is a skill that needs to be learned, and perhaps even needs to be learned early in life to wield effectively. If you don&#x27;t have the ability, classical systems languages will look like malicious ASCII soup and a language whose code you can actually read like a paragraph of text will be long-overdue respite from this misery; the same perhaps even applies to other non-verbose shorthand (as an anecdote, one of my graduate program&#x27;s logic-heavy classes is currently suffering from a student who more or less constantly interrupts the lecture to get all the mathematical notation on the board read out to him in natural language). The latest startup/trendy tech boom has made a disproportionate number of people of this type gravitate towards programming, many of them coming from the wider blogosphere/&quot;social internet&quot;; as a result, their opinions regarding what is good or bad and legible or illegible have come to entirely dominate the airwaves. It is all to easy to forget that there is a barely visible core of often significantly more prolific &quot;native&quot; programmers hiding in newsgroups/IRC channels/mailing lists and more often than not having very different measures regarding what constitutes good language design. When Rust came about, its design held the promise to finally deliver something to this group that might offer a way out of the C monastery; having it reorient itself to appeal to more popular sensibilities at this point is bound to cause a lot of hard feelings.<p>Personally, I always found the flat monotonicity of Python code to be rather unpleasant to read and write. Having what some people like to denounce as &quot;line noise&quot; actually enables a very useful visual contrast between &quot;structural&quot; (parentheses, scope boundaries, operators) components of the code and largely user-defined &quot;names&quot;. Looking at a piece of code like &quot;if(vals[1]==1 && vals==[1,2,3]) { ... }&quot; allows you to break up the code visually before having read and echoed to yourself even a single word of natural language; this can&#x27;t be said of a (hypothetical) example like &quot;if vals.at(1) equals 1 and vals equals list(1,2,3):&quot;. Adding to that the general lack of code layout flexibility and the deliberate lack of alternatives to express a given pattern, the resulting picture is that the way an experienced programmer would usually gather a slew of information from diagonally skimming over a piece of code (segmenting all of it using the visually distinct &quot;line noise&quot;, gathering when and how data is accessed, inferring the original writer&#x27;s priorities from how the code was spaced out and what constructs were chosen, spotting the names of external dependencies...) is severely crippled.",1399084499

Even tossing a quick 2-byte sequence to flip an I/O pin made the problem completely go away.<p>The problem was, of course, that the hardware wasn&#x27;t quote done rebooting, and needed to be left alone a <i>tiny</i> bit longer after hitting the RST pin. About 8 cycles longer than when the hardware engineers assured me it would be &quot;completely safe&quot;. Any time I added debug code, it simply worked as the needed delay, and was solved by a <i>very</i> carefully documented sequence of NOOPs.<p>What made this particularly infuriating, though, was it&#x27;s seemingly arbitrary sensitivity to when the real code was started. Depending on how much you padded with NOOPs, several behaviors were observed.<p><pre><code>    #NOOP | Behavior\n    ---------------\n      0   | original 75/25 ok/fail split\n      1   | always failed\n      2   | always worked\n      3   | always worked\n      4   | worked ~95% of the time\n      5   | ~80/20 ok/fail split \n      6   | ~50/50 ok/fail split (not a lot of data)\n      7   | *almost* always worked (I think I saw it fail once)\n      8+  | always worked\n</code></pre>\nOf course, the various stuff I would add for debugging tended to line up with the cases when it DID work.<p><i>sigh</i><p>I miss working with that chip.

7689234,comment,7687784,7688818,2,0,vacri,,,"Light/dark being good/bad in the European sense stems from good things being light and bad things being dark. Fire is good - it keeps you warm and cooks your food. The soot and char left over from the fire is bad, relatively useless. The day is good - it&#x27;s when you&#x27;re out and about, able to see and do things, and it&#x27;s warm. The night is bad, you can&#x27;t do much, it&#x27;s hard to see and get stuff done. Criminals do their deeds in the shadows, where they&#x27;re hard to see, as opposed to morally righteous actions, which are easily performed in the full view of day. Certainly in the christian theology that shaped Europe, dark refers to shadowy nefariousness, and not dark-skinned humans.<p>The black finance thing is rather simple - in bookkeeping, a positive total is written in normal ink, which is (usually) black. A negative total is written in red ink, to make it stand out.

Attractive young women may have difficulty getting people to take them seriously, and have to deal with things like frequent unwanted sexual advances, <i>but they have no trouble getting laid</i>. Attractive young women have easy, practically unlimited access to sex (if they so desire). Unsurprisingly, this comes at a cost.<p>Meanwhile, while it&#x27;s easier for men to be taken seriously, and they much less often have to deal with sexual harassment, <i>they often have trouble getting laid</i>—especially with the aforementioned attractive young women. It may be true that &quot;the <i>vast majority</i> of guys...are simply not aware that women...go through this stuff <i>all the time</i>&quot;. But it&#x27;s also true that the <i>vast majority</i> of women are simply not aware of how hard it is for young men, especially nerdy young men, to get appealing women to have sex with them. They would be utterly flabbergasted if they learned just how many computer geeks, science grad students, etc., have never even <i>kissed</i> a girl, much less had sex with one.<p>We see that there are plusses and minuses to each respective situation, but arguably men have it worse off, because women can complain freely of the terrible things they have to put up with, and they&#x27;re generally met with sympathy by the mainstream (and backed by the full force of Federal law). Meanwhile, men who complain that attractive young women won&#x27;t sleep with them are shamed and belittled, and told that no one owes them sex.

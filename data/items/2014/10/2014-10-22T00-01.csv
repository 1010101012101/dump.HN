It&#x27;s a collection of completely safe science experiments that parents can perform on their own babies, with no special equipment needed.  All of the projects are adapted from published academic research in various fields of child development, but don&#x27;t worry -- there&#x27;s nothing ethically troubling or harmful, and the projects aren&#x27;t meant to see if your kid &quot;measures up.&quot;  They&#x27;re just to help you better understand how your baby is developing in the first two years.<p>If you&#x27;d like a little preview, check out the December issue of Parents magazine, where (to the best of my knowledge) there will be an excerpt featuring five experiments from the book.",1413939589

They&#x27;re both a gigantic pain to learn, with obtuse configuration syntax, and in fact very few people actually learn them. They&#x27;re both environments that breed epic cargo cults because they&#x27;re overly complex, yet provide so little benefit that there&#x27;s little motivation to bother to learn them properly. All you normally care about is getting your little script to run on boot or login, so the rest is just food for bugs.<p>SMF and launchd also organically grew to take over most of the management of /etc. Now neither is hardly any better than the Windows Registry.<p>systemd is not only moving in the same direction, they&#x27;re going to leap-frog them. Why have a separate ntpd or dhcpd when you can just build it into the init framework. Why listen for SIGHUP or SIGTERM when &quot;good&quot; services (in as much as service can be good which isn&#x27;t shipped with systemd) just use the systemd C API to listen for DBUS events.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with systemd, SMF, and launchd.

I was wondering if anybody wants to build a browser plugin that automatically clicks on all ads in all pages that I visit. (or is there such a thing already out there).
The idea here is to create noise on the advertisers side, and prevent them from having any evidence/insight into what I really like and don&#x27;t like. 
Of course this does not work on Google/facebook and others with whom I voluntarily share my preferences (by using their products, search, social ...). But I am not very worried about them personally anyway. I am more annoyed by these other advertisers with whom I don&#x27;t have any direct relationship (I don&#x27;t use their free products) and they are also being very dumb about it. Like I once looked at product page (a year ago) and now everywhere I go I see ads for that damn thing.<p>In summary, anybody wants to feed noise to dumb advertisers. This makes them smarter (or the smarter ones will survive) which makes our experience better (don&#x27;t know if it makes our lives better, but that is a tall order anyway).<p>I don&#x27;t have time to do it myself, but will be happy to help if needed.<p>EDIT:

Undefined behavior is necessary so that a language can have certain kinds of conforming extensions.

For instance, a program might need to map some hardware to memory and access registers.<p>&quot;Undefined behavior&quot; in the ISO C sense only means that the ISO C standard doesn&#x27;t provide requirements about how an implementation should react to a given situation.

If the programmer wrote that, it was probably with the expectation that X + 1 <i>could be</i> less than X due to particular overflow semantics.

   can polarize the metal electrically. The wire should be 
   insulated. If not insulated, wrap the metal object in
   a single, thin strip of paper to prevent contact. The 
   battery must be a minimum of 2 volts. Form a coil with
   the electric wire and touch its ends to the battery&#x27;s 
   terminals. Repeatedly insert one end of the metal
   object in and out of the coil. The needle will become an 
   electromagnet.
</code></pre>
No, the needle will not become an &quot;electromagnet,&quot; once it&#x27;s outside the coil.  It won&#x27;t even become a good permanent magnet if you follow these directions, because you&#x27;ll tend to demagnetize it every time you withdraw it in the same direction you inserted it. (I actually tried it with a power supply, a spool of wire, and a couple of screws.  Dropping a screw through the coil in one direction 10 times will give it the same amount of magnetism that moving it in and out about 200 times will impart.)<p>In any case, none of this has anything to do with the battery&#x27;s voltage except to the extent that it provides more current per turn.

By imaginary, I mean to say arbitrary, imagined by each individual based on his views/limits/boundaries. Take your examples, you seem to think that &quot;toxic culture&quot;, &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;sexual harassment&quot; are problems, and not just inconvenient situations. Others, like Ashley from the article don&#x27;t see them as problems enough to warrant her losing her job over.

After a few failed re-attempts over a few days, we begin a drip campaign of notifications where we email them every few days with a sequence of different emails until they update their payment information or cancel their account. If the emails don&#x27;t produce a response and we&#x27;ve got their phone number on file, we&#x27;ll also try to ring them up on the phone (we have a real person to do this) and send them a follow-up email for whatever the outcome of the phone call was (e.g. customer wants to update online, we left a voicemail, it was the wrong number, etc. etc.) Some companies will have the majority of their success with just the emails, but we have customers where the success rate is split is 50/50 for emails and phone calls. Either way, <i>everyone</i> benefits from the phone calls enough to justify doing it (or in our case paying us to do it.)<p>As for the &quot;not signed in for months&quot; part, I recommend you <i>not</i> assume someone wants to cancel their account just because they haven&#x27;t signed into the service in months and their payment information randomly goes bad. Let <i>them</i> tell you this. Depending on the service you provide, people may use it seasonally, but pay each month for you to keep their data on hand. (I&#x27;ve used Basecamp this way before, although now they let you pause your account for up to 6 months.) Sometimes people use services that are &quot;set it and forget it&quot; where the user doesn&#x27;t actually need to sign into the service to receive value from it. The absolute <i>worst</i> would be for a customer of any type of service to have their account closed for non-payment with no notice whatsoever.<p>That&#x27;s really just the tip of the iceberg for thoughts that we&#x27;ve got on this subject, so feel free to reply or email me at andrew@churnbuster.io if you&#x27;ve got any other questions.",1413936954

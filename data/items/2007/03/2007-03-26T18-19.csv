You answered your own question, and I'm not talking about YC anyway.  I'm talking about VCs, and in particular the strings that come with them. <p>My purpose is to point out the disadvantages, because the assumption seems to be that its always a good thing to get VC funds.",1174935156

Paul and I are describing the same scenario... and that incentive only exists when it looks like there's a possibility for the one in a million payoff.  Otherwise Liquidation Preferences mean that even a successful sell results in no return to the founders.<p><i>""But being forced to try things more quickly than you might otherwise may help you discover problems and their solutions before others do, like a fast forward button.""</i><p>I could write code sitting here with a loaded gun on a timer, pointed at my head.  I'm sure I would find problems in that code faster and ""get it done"" faster so that I could reset the timer.... but the code would not be as high quality, and it certainly wouldn't be more innovative.<p>And if I reached the point where I knew there was no way to get it done in time, then I'd spend the time looking for an exit.  I'd have no motivation to get the code done, and a lot of motivation to get out of there.",1174934959

6414,comment,6302,6358,0,0,BitGeek,,,"I think Austin is an excellent location for a startup.  You have good high tech infrastructure, a good college that (at least in the 1990s) put out CS students who actually had a clue, a very supportive community, low cost of living (again at least it was), etc.  And a large number of very intelligent engineers.<p>Also, I wonder if something like the effect that we see in the Windows shareware market vs. the Mac shareware market isn't also happening with investors.  Mac shareware authors make more money because the mac market is smaller.  While the windows market is larger, the proportion of shareware authors is even larger, crowding out your product. So, its more profitable to target the smaller market. <p>VCs in Texas are more likely to fund a company in Texas... there may be more VCs in California than there are in Texas but there are a <i>lot</i> more startups in california competing for the funding.",1174933400

A couple follow ups- <p>8. No, I didn't know 70 founders, I didn't even know one.   But having a friend in the industry who didn't even work for a startup let me know the private details of 2-3 companies a day.  This was standard dinner conversation- who's doing what, etc. <p>6. We're all in the same pond.  I'm saying that your chances of beating Bay Area companies is better if you are not in the Bay Area.  Most of the best people in the world do not live in the Bay Area.<p>5.  Thailand is probably not a bad place... recruiting bright engineers right out of college is probably easier.  Who wants to go live in a cubicle in a generic tilt up rather than a bungalow on a beach in a small town?   Cutting these costs means you can pay people more, means you can hire better people, etc. <p>4.  IF this is true, that's even worse. With the dramatically higher cost of living, that means your employees are having more trouble making ends meet (or sharing houses, 2 to a bedroom.) <p>
Anyway, don't want to debate it to death, and was talking tongue in cheek to some extent.    Locality is much less important than it was in the 1980s and 1990s.  And past success has made the bay area somewhere I'm increasingly less interested in even visiting.",1174933125

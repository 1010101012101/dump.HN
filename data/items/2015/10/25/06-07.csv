I mean, I have no idea how much attention was paid to the development of Python&#x27;s JSON parser; it&#x27;s trivial to write a low-quality parser using regexes for scanning, OTOH it could be a C plugin with a high-quality scanner, and I could reasonably expect 1000x differences in performance.<p>Interpreted languages tend to have less predictable performance profiles because there can be a large variance in the amount of attention paid to different idioms, and some higher-level constructs can be much more expensive than a simple reading suggests. Higher level languages also usually make elegant but incredibly inefficient implementations much more likely.",1445756391

(Early binding is inherently more efficient than late binding for all the same reasons it is inherently less flexible.)<p>Or do you insist on defining &quot;efficiency&quot; solely to mean &quot;machine efficiency&quot; instead of thinking like an engineer and understanding the concept of trade-offs where no decision is inherently worse than any other?",1445756235
10446226,comment,10444714,10445823,0,0,jahewson,,,"Regarding ergonomics: keyboards are intended to be used with two hands, so if you&#x27;re trying to type Ctrl + C then your left hand presses C while your right hand presses the right control key. That way you don&#x27;t fatigue your hands and makes Cmd vs Ctrl something of a moot point.<p>Of course with the right hand on the mouse, the left hand is often used to perform both key presses. If this causes you pain, gaming mice offer programmable buttons which you could configure to give you Cmd/shift/Ctrl or other common modifier keys (or just copy/paste macros).

10446205,comment,10445129,10445369,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"There are a bunch of commercial engines built on Postgres that implement sharding and parallel querying at huge scale: Amazon Redshift, Truviso, Netezza, ParAccel, Aster Data and CitusDB come to mind. It&#x27;s a shame that none of this has tricked down into the open-source version.<p>There&#x27;s Postgres-X2 (formerly Postgres-XC), sponsored by NTT, which implements fully consistent multimaster replication and partitioning. After many, many years apparently still isn&#x27;t production-ready nor particularly scalable, and the likelihood that it will ever be merged into mainline Postgres is zero (its planner changes alone are apparently several hundred thousand lines of code).<p>More interestingly, there&#x27;s Postgres-XL, which is apparently a merger of Postgres-XC and a different implementation called StormDB that was bought by a company called TransLattice. (TransLattice also sponsored or acquired an earlier project that went nowhere, Postgres-R.) Unlike XC/X2, they say they aim to contribute changes back to the mainline, and they also claim their distributed query model is superior. With the commerical support behind it (it&#x27;s used as the basis of a commercial product), it&#x27;s possible that this is something that will be usable. Unfortunately, it seems very quiet and not very open-sourcy; most of the development seems to be by just one guy [3], and nobody seems to be using it in production at this point.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/postgres-x2/postgres-x2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/postgres-x2/postgres-x2</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.postgres-xl.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgres-xl.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgres-xl.git;a=summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgres-xl.git;a=summar...</a>",1445755460

10446193,comment,10445633,10446018,0,0,douche,,,"> it&#x27;s clear that the rising generations want to live in cities much moreso than previous ones did<p>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s necessarily that we want to, but we kinda have to.  When you&#x27;re starting off out of college with the kind of debt that your parents didn&#x27;t have until they bought their first home, you&#x27;ve got to go where the money is.  For some reason, it&#x27;s been decided that packing people into open-office cattle cribs in a handful of cities across the country is the only way to do business...  So we pack up and go live in shitty apartments in the city for a few years until we get out of debt-slavery and become skilled enough and connected enough that we can work from the places we actually want to live and raise a family.<p>It pisses me off a little bit.  In my home town, I&#x27;ve got two hundred-year-old graves of relatives in the town cemetery, and I grew up in a house built on land that was part of a farm my great-great grandfather owned before the Great Depression.  There are the hills and woods I stalked deer and turkeys in, the little mountain ponds I caught trout in, the garden I grew beans and corn and potatoes in with my family.  The elementary and high school gyms I shot thousands of hoops in and poured out uncounted gallons of sweat on.  I know every tree, every rock that sticks up out of the lawn enough to dull the lawnmower if you don&#x27;t go around.  It&#x27;s <i>home</i>, in a way that the other places I&#x27;ve had to live and work since then will never be.  It just sucks, because there is no work, and so I, along with everyone else in my generation, has had to leave and go out into these concrete jungles and lifeless suburbs to make a living.<p>Someday, I&#x27;ll have made enough money, and the world will move on enough that I can write software from my living room, and teach my kids how to grow tomatoes in that same patch of dirt.",1445754933

One dropper for one brand, four for another, to get the anti nausea effect without the more psychoactive effects.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d be perfectly happy if SquabMerCo came out with commercial product that had guaranteed contents.",1445753924

Still, on one hand, you have Zuckerberg trying to revolutionize education, while on the other hand, you have Soros and the Koch brothers inverting democracy for their personal interests. At least when the government is corrupt, you can vote them out or at worst, have violent revolution. An individual? Ask them kindly to stop? Kill them?<p>I think I&#x27;d feel more comfortable with corporation(s) competing with the government, because then, you could &quot;vote against them with your dollar.&quot; Another thing which is done in government labs in the US is having labs/universities compete with each other for funding (although whether this yields good incentives for research is another story, and we&#x27;re trying to find avenues for innovation that are difficult for the government, and ostensibly, difficult for govt labs too).<p>Finally, if we do accept this form of oligarchy (where one oligarch is the government we vote for), no doubt will we have entities which disagree with each other, say, Soros or the Koch brothers.

10446156,comment,10445129,10446114,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> HBase is not ACID and therefore not strongly consistent. The consistency in CAP is different than consistency in ACID.<p>You&#x27;re arguing the word &quot;consistent&quot; is used wrong, and then you go on to mixing ACID and CAP — two acronyms which use the word &quot;consistent&quot; with completely different meanings.<p>The &quot;C&quot; in ACID stands for data consistency, which is that you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to store any data which isn&#x27;t internally consistent with the schema&#x27;s consistency rules. For example, you&#x27;re not allowed to store a &quot;null&quot; value in a &quot;not null&quot; column, and you can&#x27;t delete a row that is pointed to by a different table&#x27;s foreign key constraint.<p>The &quot;C&quot; in Brewer&#x27;s original CAP theorem really represents atomic consistency. It&#x27;s the idea that if you submit data, you should get the exact same data back, even if you ask a different node. It <i>sort of</i> represents both the &quot;A&quot; (atomicity, in the sense that either everything or nothing is updated) in ACID, as well as the &quot;I&quot; (isolation, in the sense that nodes don&#x27;t see partial writes) and &quot;D&quot; (durability, in the sense that data written stays written).<p>In CAP terms, HBase is strongly consistent, I believe, as long as you query the primary region server and not a replica. But HBase is not transactional, and therefore it&#x27;s pretty meaningless to talk about ACID.",1445753779

I know that Cloudflare touts other features such as security, load balancing, and keeping your site up if your server is offline. I did not test or take any of these features into account. Their biggest sector is to people that want to speed their website up, so I took them to the task on just that claim.<p>If this is true and people really think that CDN = faster site, then it's a misunderstanding, perhaps perpetuated by malicious marketing by the CDNs themselves.<p>But putting a proxy in front of an unloaded site (hosted on a relatively fast server) is of course unnecessary.<p>Re-run the test using `ab2' instead of simple 3-hit tests, and that's when the CDN becomes more useful. Or perhaps host the site on an oversold bargain shared server and see how it fares.",1357401595

Graduating at the top 2% of my high school, slated for MIT, ""you'll go far kid.""<p>But here I am, feeling normal and useless. I lead a moderate sized club at RPI, but I don't even feel accomplished for it. I haven't seen any of the job offers that I felt were promised to me when I enrolled at the school, I haven't gotten any major internships.<p>As a kid I used to hit the video games pretty hard, but at some point I started to realize how fake the achievements felt. I literally can't stomach playing video games anymore. It feels like taking some sort of numbing drug. I have good memories, and I don't even regret most of the weekends I devoted entirely to video games (and the costs associated).<p>But I feel ill equipped for criticism. Not only am I ill equipped to hear criticism, but my peers are ill equipped to give criticism. Did my speech go well? What could I improve? Even when I can tell that my peers did not like what they saw, it's hard to figure out why, I don't think that some of them even know how to criticize someone within their own mind.<p>I worked a job last summer teaching kids. I still visit from time to time, and the trend of positive reinforcement and lack of criticism seems to be gaining momentum in our youth. My boss would not let me criticize my own students. And this worries me. What happens when everybody hits the real world, ill equipped for the failure that most adults will tell you happens regularly?<p>And what can we do to address the issue without swinging the pendulum in the exact opposite direction, to the fabled 'tiger' parenting that seems to carry it's own hefty share of negative consequences?",1357401334

5012912,comment,5012657,5012657,31,0,GuiA,,,"We lived in the US for a couple years when I was in grade school. My parents always laughed and mocked the stickers that my teacher would put on our assignments: ""Great Job!"", ""You're the best!"", ""#1"". (almost 20 years later, it is still a recurring joke in my family).<p>An English professor of mine in college loved to dissect differences between the French and English language, and how they highlighted the differences in how anglo-saxon cultures and French culture approach education.<p>French schools mark out of 20 (0 being worst, 20 being best); but no one ever gets 20. In middle and high school, getting 17 or 18 is already stupendous; in college, top students rarely ever go above 15, and some professors skew their grading to rarely give out marks above 10 in order to toughen up students. On the other hand, getting an A or a 100% in a US college class is not all that hard.\nIn French, we also often use the verb ""to perfect"" (""se parfaire"") to mean ""improve""; for instance, ""I'm taking classes to perfect my English"". I don't believe I've ever encountered that construction in English (if it is grammatically correct, then it is infinitely rarer)<p>My professor's main point being that in French culture, perfection is something we strive towards, but never achieve; whereas in anglo-saxon culture, it is something fully within reach.<p>I was never a straight A student; in middle and high school, my grades would rarely go above 14/20; in college, they were more around 12/20. I did finish my undergrad in a British institution, where my marks immediately skyrocketed and I graduated with the highest honors (ha). In grad school (US), I got a B or two, but they always were from some tough foreign professors.<p>By contrast, I dated an American girl for a while who had always been a straight A student in middle/high school (graduated valedictorian) and college (graduated on the dean's roll etc. etc.). Her blaring success stopped right as she graduated college though; she quickly fell in deep depression at that point due to the stark contrast with what she experienced and the professional world.<p><i>Addendum</i>: Differences between the French (and European to some extent) and American culture have fascinated me for the past few years, as I grew up in a pluricultural environment in the later years, but very French in my early years (and as I slowly become a functioning adult, understanding what shaped my youth and education is interesting to me). To anyone interested in that question, I recommend the book ""Bringing Up Bb"" by Pamela Druckerman, which is about a British/American couple discovering French parenting and contrasting it with their own. It is pop-cultury and light on actual research, but does contain interesting insights. Any recommendations on that same topic are very welcome :)",1357400708

But the ECMAScript runtime is pretty substantial so having a minimized subset of that runtime would make it possible to self-host most of the higher level interpreter in ES6-like code instead of having most of it implemented in ES3 (as it is now). This makes a significant difference in verbosity of the code.

I can't fathom any future technical case where those would do but Webkit would not.<p>But I think I covered that in my comment concerning alternative engines. Make one if you have a real need to implement something different to cover a new situation or provide something not there today. Not merely to keep your own mostly same implementation that introduces slight incompatibilities and standards lag. Current alternative engines do the latter.<p>><i>Also, consider what might happen if Webkit were the only browser engine. Sure, Webkit moves at a fast pace now, when it has competition from both other browsers and native apps, but consider that the two biggest supporters of Webkit both benefit directly from people using native apps over web-apps. Sure, they benefit from web-apps too, but Apple in particular gets actual revenue directly from native apps, so if they didn't have other browsers to compete with, maybe Webkit wouldn't be as shiny and cutting-edge as it is.</i><p>I don't think this is true. For Google is isn't true at all: it makes more money from people using the web than from people using native apps. As for Apple, well, they started the whole webkit project, and they don't make much from native apps anyway. They make their money from devices (which are used to browse the web also, so need a top notch engine) and laughably less from selling native apps (it's just a side business for them). Plus, all this time with native apps and the like, they have enhanced Webkit and mobile Safari the same.<p>But, let's say that what you say is true: if some companies indeed favored native apps instead of web apps, wouldn't that make even more important that all other companies that care about the web flock to maintain ONE and only engine, instead of working each in it's own engine?<p>That way they could make it as good as it can be, remove compatibility issues and generally make the web attractive and achieve progress and new features faster.<p>><i>The thing is, if Webkit were the only browser-engine, even if you did come up with some completely different engine, your idea would be useless. You wouldn't be able to achieve compatibility with existing sites without mimicking all the weird bugs and corner-cases of Webkit, which would not be feasible, and if your idea is so completely different you can't just fork the Webkit code and add your idea on top.</i><p>The thing you describe as bad is actually BETTER than what you have to do today.<p>Because today, if you come up with some ""completely different engine"", in order to ""achieve compatibility with existing sites"" you would not just have to ""mimic all the weird bugs and corner-cases of Webkit"" but also those of the other major engines.<p>Better to have just ONE engine to mimic, no?",1357398852

I would say that Continuum is the only one that qualifies to be called a ""JavaScript engine"" in its own right.<p>Narcissus is a meta-circular interpreter that puts a thin layer over the host engine, and requires that host engine itself to have some ES6 features (it can only actually run in Spidermonkey and V8 with the --harmony flag enabled).<p>Caja is more of a wrapper that protects access to capabilities than anything. In fact it specifically avoids fully parsing source code itself in order to be performant. Its goal is to sandbox code, not interpret it.<p>Continuum implements the ES6 Object Model and nearly fully implements the internal algorithms of the ~450 page ES6 specification (aside a small handful of things which are a bit out of date or remain to be implemented). In fact, the only thing it does not implement itself is RegExp, which it currently wraps the host engine's functionality to provide. It even fully implements the Date internal algorithms (<a href=""https://github.com/Benvie/continuum/blob/gh-pages/engine/builtins/%40date.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Benvie/continuum/blob/gh-pages/engine/bui...</a>).<p>Additionally, it self-hosts much of its own code.

My question is why there isn't a stronger, official governing body for inclusion of certs in browsers. Right now it looks like MS, Mozilla and Google are the de facto deciders of whose certificates can be bundled  by default in a browser. This basically decides who can be a root CA. The problem is, as three un-coordinated entities with no formal relationship, they have no procedure for putting the toothpaste back in the tube - they can't revoke a certificate, because there's no procedure.<p>Personally, I would promote the creation of a separate body for managing root CA certificates, in which any browser vendor could participate. Members would agree to bundle only the certs approved by the body. The body would collect from participating CAs a certain portion of the monies paid for certificates - somewhere between 25% and 50%, to be released when the certificate expires. This serves as a sort of escrow for services rendered - customers can be confident they will get n years of use out of a certificate, even if the CA vanishes. Top level CAs would be responsible for remitting payments from intermediates they authorized. This would form a fund to facilitate the movement of customers, in the event a CA became illiquid or was deauthorized - sort of an FDIC for SSL certs.<p>If a breach of trust occurred, or a CA went bankrupt, had its assets seized by a corrupt government, etc. this body would have the authority to blacklist the CAs certs after a window - 30 to 60 days. They would notify all of the CA's customers that they were being issued new, free certificates from a still-authorized CA of their choosing, with the payment for the new CA to be issued ( at a lower than market, but not insubstantial ) from the depository insurance fund. The body would provide customers with a list of approved CAs by country, and while the remitting process would likely be a nightmare the first time, at least people would have a timely way to get new, valid certs. Customers would complain a bit about the work to deploy new certs, but that's the cost of running (actually) secure infrastructure.<p>This would achieve a few goals:\n- browsers would be obligated to bundle a common set of certs, with a common approval and audit process. This should be less work for new CAs to get approved\n- CAs would have a financial incentive to stay secure - a breach means we can legitimately revoke your authority, and you no longer own the cash we held in escrow\n- browsers would have teeth to create a 'death penalty' like Mozilla proposes, and better yet, they would all have the same criteria\n- certificate owners would be less conflicted between user security and their financial interests - the escrow would reduce their losses if a CA became insolvent",1357398053

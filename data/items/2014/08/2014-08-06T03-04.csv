8140927,comment,8139534,8140754,1,0,rtpg,,,">I think they understand they are just pushing an alternate view of reality (and interpretation of surveillance, search and so on terms). The idea they run with is unless a human looks at the data, it is not a search or seizure so Constitutional protections don&#x27;t take effect.<p>I think there&#x27;s also the fact that realising something is a phone number of an email account might not be considered a search, in the &quot;expectation of privacy&quot; sense.<p>If you send postal mail, you expect the contents not to be looked at by the mailman, but do you expect the fact that you sent a letter to be private?<p>Now, &quot;common sense&quot; might dictate otherwise, but Smith Vs. Maryland is the precedent, and the Courts don&#x27;t think the fact that you&#x27;re calling someone (and even who you&#x27;re calling) to be private. So looking at whether its a phone number or email might also not be expected to be &quot;private&quot; information, even if the contents are.<p>>Maybe later you do something suspicious, like participate in some protest -- then you are labeled a terrorist, i.e. person of interest. They get a warrant even (to be legit and all) and do a search for everything you ever did online since, well forever.<p>That&#x27;s not how evidence works. The gov&#x27;t isn&#x27;t authorised to collect everyone&#x27;s info, so even if they have it on hand (a point the gov&#x27;t disputes in this case), they don&#x27;t necessarily have the write to use it.<p>One of the points of the gov&#x27;t in the case is that the EFF is arguing that the filtering is a two step process : collect all data, then filter it. But the EFF doesn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s actually how things are happening, and it might not be. So the lawyers are actually refuting the plantiff&#x27;s main line of reasoning.<p>This case is not about the core of the law, it&#x27;s about implementation details. Ones that we do not know.",1407297441

The strategy had worked with Random House; Pegasus was ready to knuckle under; only Klinger (so far as we know) resisted. In effect he was a private attorney general, combating a disreputable business practice—a form of extortion—and he is seeking by the present motion not to obtain a reward but merely to avoid a loss. He has performed a public service—and with substantial risk to himself, for had he lost he would have been out of pocket for the $69,803.37 in fees and costs incurred at the trial and appellate levels ($30,679.93 + $39,123.44). The willingness of someone in Klinger’s position to sue rather than pay Doyle’s estate a modest license fee is important because it injects risk into the estate’s business model. As a result of losing the suit, the estate has lost its claim to own copyrights in characters in the Sherlock Holmes stories published by Arthur Conan Doyle before 1923. For exposing the estate’s unlawful business strategy, Klinger deserves a reward but asks only to break even.&quot;<p>Note that the above is the official opinion of the court, and not just that of Klinger and his attorney.  And although only citing it as a quoted example, Posner makes it clear that he feels Warner Brothers is using the same strategy with &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;:<p>&quot;Depoorter and Walker (id. at 345 n. 172) give the example of the Summy-Brichard Company, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group, which “receives approximately $2 million per year in royalty payments for licenses to the song ‘Happy Birthday to You,’ despite the fact that the song is most likely in the public domain,” as argued in Robert Brauneis, “Copyright and the World’s Most Popular Song,” 56 J.

I wrote a similar blog post to this one except using Elm as the reactive system[0], D3 for composable views[1], and MVC as the application architecture[2]. Once you have a reactive system and a declarative representation for your interface, applications get much easier to build. Decentralized state and event handling is secondary to those two concerns, and frankly of dubious value: once you start using lense-like things to help manage the distributed state, you&#x27;re still going to run into issues where the lens isn&#x27;t expressive enough to to handle certain operations (deleting an item from a list, for example), forcing you to either change your model so the lens is expressive enough, or dispatch events to a centralized location to handle the change.

8140878,comment,8140225,8140825,6,0,slykat,,,"With the pivot of UberX yes. Previously Uber had a luxury brand position, all of their products (UberX, Black Car, SUV) were priced higher than a taxi, and the bulk of their revenue was coming from black car services. I remember the old advertising and they never had the concept of a &quot;sale&quot; or messaging about their pricing relative to the competition.<p>However the rise of Lyft and other competitors essentially pushed Uber to go into a price gauging war. They went into a big price cut with UberX that essentially made them cheaper than both Lyft & taxis, and had a lot of advertising campaigns talking about their price advantage. This happened late last year (I believe) and since then both Lyft & Uber have been going through a series of price cuts & driver promotions to compete on both side of the table.<p>So yes, Uber users are definitely price conscious. This has happened largely because Uber has shifted its model more towards UberX. Slashing fares was a pretty bold move (companies rarely cannibalize cash cows with high margins).<p>The new focus, I think is to consolidate their position by growing aggressively, competing with Lyft on pricing & driver promotions, and ultimately, drive the cost of service so low that they expand the market past on-demand limos (Uber before X), cabs (Uber now), to a service cheaper than owning a car (Uber in the future).",1407296506

The price is based on the discounted future cashflows possible from the licensing project in question.  If the scope of &quot;future&quot; is limited solely to the lifetime of the author, then the socioeconomic inequities that cause, say, race to be a significant factor in life expectancy will be directly responsible for enforcing that distinction further.<p>Or more simply, it causes the same novel written by a rich young white man to receive a better licensing deal than if it were written by a poor old black man.<p>This may of course already be the case, but any such rule would exacerbate matters.

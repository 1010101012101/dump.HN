They are real needs. So, not having these features means not to satisfy some user requirements.</i><p>Not necessarily.  Interaction Design has always focused on profiling users and then using those profiles to expose the functionality that user needs while obscuring the functions they don't.  So ""eliminating"" a feature can just mean having the user set up what features they will use before hand and then using that info the streamline your UI (clearly you'd want some way to change those preferences but that's another discussion)<p>I think a lot of UI design has gone backwards by ignoring this insight.  To give one example, Toolbars have gotten a bad name because developers used them badly in the past.  But they had a good purpose which was to allow users to un-clutter their interface by hiding functions they don't use.  Now we have Microsoft pushing the unwieldy, homogeneous Ribbon which throws all those confusing features at the user.<p>But the bottom line is I don't think you need to go as far as taking out a feature just to eliminate it from the sight of a user who won't use it",1254988590

868557,comment,868132,868213,0,0,snprbob86,,,"As you state, there is a lot of evidence that everybody uses a different 20% of the features. However, I think that primary applies to horizontal apps such as operating systems and core office productivity suites.<p>I recall reading on Jensen Harris' Office 2007 new UI blog that they tried their damnedest to remove features, but no one could come up with any reasonable way to pick any features to cut other than a select few which were practically unused by anyone. They had extensive usage data to work with. Meanwhile, the feature-poor Windows Live Writer has taken off like a rocket for bloggers.<p>That may be true for something like Excel, Word, Linux, etc, but I think that wouldn't be as true for vertical applications. Sometimes, I wonder if would be better off turning the core word processing components into a library and releasing verticals for different types of writers. Professional writers, for instance, probably don't need any formatting tools other than headings. Blog writers should only use things that can be represented well by typical HTML blog engines. Etc.<p>I think this is a case where the advice that is right for startups (typically verticals) is not right for the big guys. As a little guy, I'm betting on nailing 20% of the features and scoring 18% of what people want :-)",1254987567

As metrics come in, we keep every single datapoint for the first 6 hours. After 6 hours, data gets rolled up into 5-minute archive. Each datapoint in the 5-minute archive then contains avg, min, max, etc for all the points that lived within that 5-minute span.<p>The archiving carries on through progressively broader windows as time goes on -- a 10-minute archive, 1-hr archive, etc. This progressive aggregation is the only sane approach to storing the massive amount of data we get. And, it reflects the need for higher resolution for recent events -- it's rare you need to see what happened at <i>one exact minute</i> 6 months ago.<p>It was this progressive archiving that bit us, specifically as DB performance degraded over time with lots of insertions/deletions.

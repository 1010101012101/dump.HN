What you&#x27;re talking about sounds like the field of program synthesis[1], which uses SMT solvers (among other technologies) to generate code to some specification. I worked on a system[2] that used this sort of technique to optimize code for a weird architecture (GreenArrays&#x27; Forth-based chip[3]) and it was certainly much easier to implement than a classical optimizing compiler.<p>Perhaps the most relevant example project here would be Rosette[4], which is basically a framework for easily writing synthesizers for different tasks. It would let you implement a description of your machine in Scheme (ie write a simple interpreter) and automatically generate a synthesizer for it that could compile programs in your language to formulas in a solver of some sort.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bodik/cs294/fa12/Lectures/L1/L1-overview-notes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bodik/cs294/fa12/Lectures/L1/L1-...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://jelv.is/chlorophyll.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jelv.is/chlorophyll.pdf</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.greenarraychips.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenarraychips.com/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~emina/rosette/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~emina/rosette/</a>",1427403493

9273065,comment,9266277,9268675,0,0,cozzyd,,,"I agree that it would be nice if it were easier to be a research scientist, and I certainly support more funding for basic science research, but mostly because I think it&#x27;s important, not necessarily because scientists are especially exploited.<p>If you are really good, connected, or lucky, and are willing to make the requisite &quot;sacrifices,&quot; then you can end up in a permanent research scientist role. I put &quot;sacrifices&quot; in quotes because these are many careers that people choose to go into (social work, community organizing, arguably teaching) that require much greater sacrifices and would be equally irrational if one were not passionate about the work. The correct response is probably that all these groups should be compensated better, and I (perhaps selfishly) agree,  but right now. a research scientist is a much cushier, more prestigious, job than a social worker, and arguably marginally less important to society. (more disclosure: my wife is a social worker)<p>If, like most, you aren&#x27;t able to get a permanent research job, or aren&#x27;t willing to make the &quot;sacrifices&quot;, you can go into industry, where (usually) you will make much more money but not get to work on things as interesting. If you hadn&#x27;t gone into a PhD program, this is likely where you would have ended up in the first place. There is some opportunity cost of reduced total earnings (even if you get a higher salary with a PhD, it&#x27;s likely you would have made up for that by not being a low-paid graduate student or postdoc for so long), but if you are passionate about science, then at least you will have spent 5-10 years doing it before getting a &quot;real job.&quot;<p>I, like most of my peers, do want to end up being a researcher, but I harbor no illusion that this is the most likely eventual outcome. If I can&#x27;t find a comfortable arrangement, I&#x27;ll leave the field, do something else and be no worse off for it. I do realize that I am fortunate to be in a field (experimental high energy physics) where the impedance mismatch to industry is relatively good. Other fields may require different ratios of passion to &quot;sacrifice&quot; to be a good choice.",1427403430

The credit card companies know this but calculated the money lost to fraud is still outweighed by consumer convenience. Also, we are seeing things like Apple Pay starting to address the credit card number.<p>3) But there is an advantage to people who do know how to stay within a budget and not overspend. First, if money is stolen or their is a dispute, then the credit card issuer is on the hook and they have a strong incentive to resolve the issue quickly and fairly. When money is taken from your bank account as in a debit and there is a problem, you may have liquidity problems as you wait for this to be resolved.

First is verifying that the kernel doesn&#x27;t expose routines that let you do these kinds of things. This is a kind of s/w verification problem, somewhat well studied. Second, you want to make sure there are no h/w bugs in the microcontroller itself which the user mode software can exploit to do bad stuff. This is traditional h/w verification, also well-studied. The third is that there aren&#x27;t weird corners of the microcontroller ISA specification itself which can be exploited. This is also a kind of h/w bug albeit a specification bug.<p>The third part is where Z3 comes in because often, there isn&#x27;t any specification, and if there is, it&#x27;s a bunch of PDFs or word documents.

For example, zeroinstall uses a SAT solver to resolve dependency conflicts.<p><a href=""http://0install.net/solver.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://0install.net/solver.html</a><p>A sillier example is the time I used a sat solver to find the solutions for a flash puzzle game. The part I&#x27;m proudest of is that the sat solver could handle the highly symmetric cases that stumped the hand-written backtracking algorithms. And if I had used an SMT solver instead of SAT I would not have had to convert everything all the way doen to boolean formulas.<p><a href=""https://github.com/hugomg/hexiom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hugomg/hexiom</a><p>In the readme I explain a bit why the sat solver helped.",1427401799

In our experience, over an extended period of time, there was virtually no legitimate use originating from Mailinator users.  Maybe it&#x27;s a fantastic service for others.  For us, it was hands down the biggest source of abuse.  It would be extremely difficult for anyone to convince me of its legitimacy in the face of the data we saw over a prolonged period.<p>And it&#x27;s not even that Mailinator users would sign up, try it for 30 minutes, and then just move on.  In that case, I&#x27;d just say they weren&#x27;t qualified, didn&#x27;t like the service, didn&#x27;t find the value prop, whatever.  But that&#x27;s not what happened.<p>I don&#x27;t really think the &quot;you&#x27;re going to get screwed, so just learn how to get screwed&quot; attitude is really appropriate.  There have been a few armchair theories on how we should have dealt with the issue.  Suffice to say, 10 paragraphs of text here aren&#x27;t going to enumerate everything we tried.  And it&#x27;s not as if we made no product improvements in that period either.<p>Simply put: if you don&#x27;t want to use the service, great.  If you don&#x27;t find it valuable, that&#x27;s fine too.  But no one&#x27;s taking the high road trying to perennially use a service without paying for it, meanwhile calling it a quality issue.<p>And none of this is abstract.  We tried all sorts of technical solutions.  People just found another way to abuse.  We slapped the credit card gate up and had not a single Mailinator signup for the 2 years after that.  It simply solved the problem.  Maybe someone will up the ante with fake credit cards . . . for us, we found thousands of Mailinator users weren&#x27;t willing to take that step.",1427401235

So what I would suggest is to try to look for smaller projects, or sub problems where you can work relatively independently, so you can have the satisfaction of having contributed to the company, and build that level of trust and reputation in the team, and also in parallel try to interact with others in the team with the intention of finding a &#x27;mentor&#x27; who understands you and helps you guide through the politics of your workplace.

Its okay to not understand something, everyone knows that if you do not admit it, you&#x27;ll never learn and therefore are a lost cause. This is the major problem I have seen with people in your situation. \n- Do not get caught in details, focus on understanding the big picture and get the basics right. Always put things in perspective. \n- Volunteer to do grunt work, will make you gain experience and put things in perspective. \n- When something isn&#x27;t clear, do not assume it works in a way thats practical to what you are doing and go on, go ask instead. Otherwise you doing grunt work will lose everyone&#x27;s time. \n- When you don&#x27;t understand something, explain what you understand or how you see thing and why, let your perception be corrected. \n- Do not get yourself too tired by studying outside of work.

Check some of my latest comments for a breakdown of pricing.<p>Prices are from AH, one of the more expensive supermarkets here. [0] Chicken breast is $6.50 per kilo, no bones just the breast, or indeed ~$3 a pound. 100g serving is recommended here, but then that may be the difference between Europe and the US.<p>Ground beef is even cheaper. Of course these are the lower-end prices, you can pay $20 for a kilo, too. But for the cheaper prices the meat is still excellent as AH is one of the most expensive supermarkets.<p>The cheaper supermarkets here, which are still decent quality overall, get you a 10-20% discount. The cheaper shops have small discounts (5-10%) on things like meat or salmon as we don&#x27;t see a lot of branding premiums here on meats. And bigger discounts (15-20%) on things like ketchup or cola, where if you buy a no-name brand that tastes just fine you pay a third less.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t have thought the US had more expensive meats. When I was last stateside I remember paying a pittance at the golden coral and leaving with the feeling I just ate 5 cows for the price of a cinema ticket! How they remained profitable boggled my mind at the time, even with cheap & absolute garbage ingredients I must have cost them some that day :P<p>Eggs are as cheap as 15c and as expensive as 40c an egg. So a dozen can be less than $2.<p>Two things must be mentioned... one is that it&#x27;s not a purchasing power parity comparison. I&#x27;d say average wages are a little lower in the Netherlands than in the US (although I think the median family is a lot better off here), meaning there&#x27;s a bit less to spend here, putting cheaper prices here on some foods in perspective.<p>And the Euro is abnormally weak right now which is likely a temporary thing. Normally the Euro is about 30% stronger, so any price conversion I do now would normally be 30% higher.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Heijn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Heijn</a>",1427400589

9272704,comment,9271246,9271463,0,0,geofft,,,"(Someone had a post asking a good question about what this means. It got downvoted and deleted, which I think is unfortunate for a community that cares about learning about the world around it, so I&#x27;m replying here.)<p>There are two separate kinds of legal protection at issue here, copyright and patent. The only thing that&#x27;s close to covering ideas is patent law, not copyright law. (I&#x27;m assuming US law here, since that&#x27;s where Facebook and I both are, but most of this is generally true I think.)<p>Copyright covers a creative expression, and is automatic. If I write a story, paint a picture, compose a song, or code a program, copyright secures my ability to commercialize that creative work as I see fit. If someone else writes a similar story, paints a similar picture, etc. but does not use my words or notes or lines of code, they aren&#x27;t infringing my &quot;copy right&quot;, because they&#x27;re not copying my work.<p>Patents cover inventions, and are very non-automatic and best acquired with lawyers. Their term is also much shorter (about a decade, instead of about a century). US law currently lets you patent an algorithm or an arrangement of computer systems, under the artifice that you&#x27;re actually patenting the implementation of that algorithm on any physical computers. Patents are issued for the invention, not for a specific implementation, and any implementation that works the same way infringes the patent.<p>(Trademarks, for reference, cover names used in advertising, i.e., &quot;trade marks&quot;. They&#x27;re somewhat automatic, they only cover names, and they&#x27;re not very often relevant to F/OSS licenses.)<p>Traditionally, F/OSS licenses have been primarily concerned with copyright, partly because several of them were written when software copyrights were well-acknowledged and enforced, but when software patents were rare or nonexistent. This leaves you in the unfortunate situation where e.g. Facebook can write some code (automatically gaining a copyright), get a patent on the idea, open-source the code, and then sue you for <i>patent</i> infringement despite your <i>copyright</i> license. To avoid that, Facebook has an explicit patent grant in addition to the copyright license. (Although, as other commenters have pointed out, F/OSS licenses that don&#x27;t specifically restrict themselves to copyright can potentially be read as a implicit patent grant if you stare at it hard enough.)<p>At no point in this does Facebook claim ownership of your work. Certainly your <i>idea</i> isn&#x27;t legally owned by anyone, either you or by Facebook, if you haven&#x27;t gotten a patent on it. Facebook&#x27;s patents remain Facebook&#x27;s patents, with or without this clause.<p>Because patents cover any implementation of an invention (whether or not the implementor knew about the patent), and because patents are in stupidly dense legalese, it&#x27;s super common for people to be inadvertently infringing a bunch of patents. The traditional solution for this is that large companies have defensive patent portfolios in a sort of mutually-assured-destruction scenario: if Facebook sues Google over a patent, Google will countersue over all the patents they have. So there&#x27;s an armistice, at least among big companies. The explicit patent grant weakens that, because now Google can just incorporate parts of React into their React-competitor, and Facebook loses a patent from their defensive portfolio.<p>So a few clauses like these are normal: you get a patent grant from Facebook, as long as you don&#x27;t sue Facebook over (different) patent infringement. This maintains the armistice between big companies, and it&#x27;s also great for the little guy, who wasn&#x27;t going to sue anyway because they don&#x27;t have any/many patents (but also doesn&#x27;t have a defensive portfolio because they don&#x27;t have any/many patents). These clauses only cover claims of patent infringement, which are the thing that everyone is unintentionally doing en masse, not copyright infringement, which is much harder to do unintentionally, so they&#x27;re pretty fair.<p>But the fourth clause is super weird. It means that you can&#x27;t dismantle any of Facebook&#x27;s patents by e.g. providing prior art, without losing your patent license. It might even mean you can&#x27;t lobby for software patent reform. It solely holds up Facebook&#x27;s patent portfolio and the armistice between big companies. Usually dismantling patents is a <i>good</i> thing for everyone, because it&#x27;s disarmament, and it&#x27;s unfortunate this license doesn&#x27;t extend to people who do that.<p>(IANAL, TINLA, corrections graciously appreciated.)",1427400484

Sam is already taking risk on current valuations, another $100K here or there isn&#x27;t going to move the needle.  The real stakes are reputation for prognostication.  And the point to me is getting VCs on the other side of the debate to put a public stake in the ground, and hopefully give their arguments for why.<p>So I don&#x27;t find this taker particularly interesting.  In the context of an industry wide debate, the opinion of someone who doesn&#x27;t have an audience similar to Sam&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really mean much.  Not that they aren&#x27;t smart, just that they aren&#x27;t someone influencing the discussion.  Which is what this is mostly about.<p>And to say &quot;I take the bet&quot; without any discussion of why really misses the whole point.<p>Of course Sam should take this bet.  But I&#x27;d suggest that he amend his proposal: Find people with enough audience to change the discussion, who are talking about bubble valuations, and ask them specifically to put a stake in the ground on this.",1427400282

Given that companies generally go bankrupt because their liabilities to creditors exceed their assets, this almost always means that all shares in the company are reduced to a value of nothing, the rare exception being when a company&#x27;s assets exceed its liabilities, but goes bankrupt because it is unable to liquidate its assets fast enough to pay its creditors on time.

We usually use alists because they are persistent.  When I reach for a mutable hash table, it&#x27;s usually part of some imperative process where I start from an empty table.<p>Depending on the Scheme you use, there could also be a persistent hash table implementation.

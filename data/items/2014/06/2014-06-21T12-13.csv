7924859,comment,7922028,7922028,8,0,hibikir,,,"I think this is a natural result of having so many kids that have no idea of what to do in life.<p>Take a snapshot of the labor force of a country. Then try to figure out how many of those professions a high school kid understands. Do they know what those people find rewarding about their job? What they don&#x27;t? Do they have any idea of how an entire career might look like? They don&#x27;t. So when you ask one of those kids what they&#x27;ll want to do when they stop formal education, they&#x27;ll go back to the few things that they are taught are desirable, and the few other occupations that are close to them. One of which, for every single kid, is to teach, since they&#x27;ve been surrounded by them all their lives.<p>Keeping studying after getting a Bachelor&#x27;s is also a very tempting option for kids that are afraid of change. Think of something very different from college, or get a master&#x27;s? Go look for a job, or get a Ph.D? Inertia makes some people go for advanced degrees, even though they don&#x27;t really understand the road they are getting into.<p>I know plenty of people who finished a Ph.D, started doing post docs, then realized that now their options had narrowed significantly, that the tenure track was not going to happen any time soon, so their options were to become adjuncts, study even more to consider teaching at a high school, or accept that 5-10 years worth of education was completely wasted. This leads to a major glut of qualified people, which then get paid very little.<p>I believe we should spend a whole lot of effort teaching kids what odds they are actually facing when they make their career choices. I still meet interns that are doing post graduate education at the same time that don&#x27;t realize how terrible the odds really are, and that&#x27;s with them working in a company that is one of the few industry outlets out there for people that went into Ph.Ds and then saw how scary the teaching market was, so it&#x27;s not like they cannot hear plenty of stories.<p>Bad information just leads to bad resource allocation for all of us. We should help with that.",1403355533

This is like optimising for the least readable code possible. I imagine it&#x27;s going to be a nightmare in practise.<p>Developers always seem to be complaining about having to type this or that, when they should be much more concerned with what they have to read!<p>Really, I couldn&#x27;t care less about typing a few extra characters. I can type pretty fast anyway and usually spend more time thinking than I do typing. What I do care about is being able to tell exactly what some code does by glancing at it, without worrying too much about whether someone wrote = instead of ==. Rust seems to be setting itself up for loads of those kinds of errors by trying to make the syntax terse at the expense of making it readable.<p>I have high hopes for Rust and will reserve judgement until it is stable; from what I&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s still in a high state of flux. However for now, I much prefer the KISS approach taken by Go, in spite of a couple of things missing from the language (that will probably get there in the end).",1403355498

He told me the other day he spent $100k &quot;figuring it out&quot; and has burned through some 100+ people.  He now has a core of about 12 that contribute and a small core of about 4 people who are daily parts of his team.<p>His insight is that you want a process to bring people in and shoot them quickly if they don&#x27;t work out.  It&#x27;s sort of sink-or-swim but with a rubber ducky that has a leak in it.  If they figure out the system from documentation and start contributing good stuff the core team will start working more with them.  If they&#x27;re slow to respond, don&#x27;t submit stuff that looks useful they just whack them and move on.<p>He has some pretty amazing people on his team, that said he&#x27;s dealing with the typical timezone and remote worker synchronization problem that all these teams have.  Recent conversations have turned towards building a core team that is &quot;in an office together&quot; somewhere to get core work moving quickly and smoothly with stuff at the edges being worked on oDesk team members.<p>I personally haven&#x27;t done any oDesk projects yet but I imagine &quot;Hire carefully fire quickly&quot; is going to be the best advice I can give.",1403355282

They found concentrations highest in the North Pacific Gyre. The authors cited wind and currents as the primary force driving the higher concentrations to the center of the Gyre. Concentrations of what? Number one, monofilament fishing line fragments; and number two, something called neuston plastic. Neuston plastic refers to particles that have been broken down to a small size and are now floating just at or below the surface of the water. Most plastic floating in the open ocean degrades quite quickly, due primarily to ultraviolet radiation. It becomes brittle and crumbles. When it reaches microscopic size, it competes with phytoplankton as a food source for zooplankton, and enters the food chain. That&#x27;s not good for anyone. The authors used 203 sample stations, each about 450 square meters in size. 52.2% of these contained plastic fragments.<p>Got that? Only half of NOAA&#x27;s football-field sized sample areas, in the center of the densest part of the Pacific &quot;Garbage Patch&quot;, contain even detectable levels of microscopic plastic. Unacceptable to be sure; but hardly a solid island.&quot;</i>",1403355030

7924827,comment,7923807,7924365,2,0,barrkel,,,"The failure mode of a component is a function of how it&#x27;s implemented. When a library couldn&#x27;t connect to a server or couldn&#x27;t open a file, you gain <i>nothing</i> by wrapping that exception, unless it&#x27;s to indicate the semantic nature of the server or what the file is used for - and these things are normally obvious from the stack trace method names.<p>Wrapping exceptions as they bubble up is only helpful if the wrapped exception adds context that aids in diagnosing the issue. Otherwise it&#x27;s just boilerplate that obfuscates and gives a certain type of developer warm fuzzies. &quot;Exposing implementation&quot; is a non-counterargument - the component failed because its implementation preconditions were violated, you need to address those implementation preconditions to fix the problem!<p>You don&#x27;t need to import dependencies unless you intend to catch the specific originally thrown exceptions, and that&#x27;s not normally what happens in the top loop; it normally logs, dumps or transmits the exception message and possibly its stack trace. These operations are normally only rely on the base exception type, so there&#x27;s no need to catch a more specific exception.<p>Problem languages for this approach, though, are C++ (where the culture makes a single base class for exceptions awkward) and Java (where throws clauses, a deeply misguided feature, may force dependency imports unless you specify &#x27;throws Exception&#x27; - or my preference, wrap in RuntimeException).<p>PS: I should add the other fundamental problem with the Java throws clause is that it uses static types to analyze dynamic data flow in a language with polymorphism, which makes it a usability disaster. When the code being invoked is indirectly accessed via polymorphic references, exception flow checking falls apart.

This is not validating an idea. This is having a solution and looking for a problem.<p>To actually validate this idea, you need a few things.  (Note: if all you want to do is build something for fun, then you don&#x27;t need to validate anything at all!  Building it for fun should be enough. Just don&#x27;t expect anything more out of it, and if you decide to productize it, expect to start over from scratch.)<p>First, get rid of everything after &quot;The idea is: Digital guestbook&quot;.  Everything after that is way too specific.  You need a hypothesis you can test, and your hypothesis is &quot;Is there market interest for guestbooks, but digital.&quot;<p>Second, asking strangers here, in this way, isn&#x27;t helpful. It&#x27;s not providing true validation. This isn&#x27;t any better than asking friends and family what they think of your idea. None of the data you get out of this (or asking your friends/family) is valid. It can&#x27;t be used to support a business case.<p>To actually validate your idea, you need to start by making a list of places where companies already use guestbooks.  The last time I saw a guestbook was a wedding.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I saw one in a business.  Find businesses that use a traditional, paper guestbook.  Make a list of both the type of business (retail, restaurant, etc.) and the actual businesses name/location themselves.<p>Then, interview the business owners.  Not a manager, not the cashier, but the owner, the person who is ultimately financially responsible for the entire enterprise.  Ask them why they have a guestbook.  Ask them what they get out of it.  Ask them when they started having one and why.  Ask them what they got out of it then and how that is different from what they get out of it now.  Ask them about other ways they get information about their customers.  Ask them to compare and contrast the utility of those methods with the guestbook.  Ask them what kind of information they&#x27;d like to get from customers, but currently don&#x27;t, or don&#x27;t get well, or don&#x27;t get easily.<p>Don&#x27;t ask them about your digital guestbook idea at all.<p>Rather, interview enough business owners in different types of businesses until you start to see patterns emerging.  This could be as few as a dozen interviews.  This could also not be until you&#x27;ve interviewed a dozen people in each type of business.  2-3 is not enough, you need 8-12 people saying roughly the same thing, unprompted, on their own.<p>Once you have that consensus, <i>then</i> you can evaluate your &quot;guestbooks, but digital&quot; idea against it.  Do &quot;guestbooks, but digital&quot; solve those problems?<p>No?<p>Then you were not able to validate your hypothesis.  Don&#x27;t pursue it.<p>Yes?<p>Then you need to see if businesses would <i>pay you</i> for digital guestbooks.  Go back to those businesses.  Present your understanding of the problem.  Make sure it&#x27;s correct.  If it is, present how &quot;guestbooks, but digital&quot; solves that problem.  Ask them to sign a check for $X.  Do they sign a check?<p>No?<p>Then you were not able to validate your hypothesis.  Don&#x27;t pursue it.<p>Yes?<p>Then go build it and sell it.<p>That&#x27;s the only true validation: will they cut you a check? That&#x27;s the core part of MVP that people forget about: it&#x27;s the minimum product that someone will <i>pay for.</i><p>If they would, that&#x27;s validation for your idea. If they wouldn&#x27;t, you need to figure out if your solution is wrong, or if there&#x27;s not a market there.<p>Good luck!",1403354173
7924817,comment,7919683,7920571,1,0,wiz21,,,"Having been in the demoscene (Imphobia) for a long time and having been in more abstract (quad tree construction optimizations) stuff I can say that writing a demo is not the same as computing theory. Writing a demo is most often exploiting a very narrow area of a given technology to produce a seducing effect (more often than not, to fake something thought impossible so that it looks possible). So you&#x27;re basically constraining the problem to fit your solution.<p>On the other hand, designing pure algorithms is about figuring a solution for a given, canonical and often unforgiving problem (quicksort, graph colouring ?). To me, this is much harder. It involves quite the same amount of creativity but somehow, it&#x27;s harder on your brain : no you can&#x27;t cheat, no you can&#x27;t linearize n² that easily :-)<p>To take an example. You can make &quot;convincing&quot; 3D on a C64 in a demo because you can cheat, precalculate, optimize in various way for a given 3D scene. Now, if you want to do the same level of 3D but for a video game where the user can look at your scene from unplanned point of views, then you need to have more flexible algorithms such as BSP trees. So you end up working at the algorithm/abstract level...<p>A very good middle ground here was Quake&#x27;s 3D engine. They used the BSP engine and optimized it with regular techniques (and there they used the very smart idea of potentially visible sets) but they also used techniques found in demo&#x27;s (M. Abrash work on optimizing texture mapping is a nice &quot;cheat&quot; -- and super clever)<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, academics is not more impressive than demoscene (but certainly a bit more &quot;useful&quot; for the society as whole) These are just two different problems and there are bright minds that makes super impressive stuff in both of them...<p>stF",1403354035

I would periodically get emails from google saying if I do something they would add an extra fifty bucks credit.<p>My biggest three recommendations are:\n-Keep cost low.  I saw that some people were paying like $10 for a Justin Beiber click.  Maybe if you are trying to sell some hair-gel to make you look like justin beiber buying a $.25 hair-gel keyword could be better from a cost perspective.\n-Target location.  My clickrate went up a bunch for a few months but didn&#x27;t see an influx of users.  I checked analytics and found a bunch of clicks were coming from some weird Japanese website.  Some kind of fraud.  It was using like 90% of my click payments.  I disabled Japan and had no problems since.\n-Be very careful accepting their auto-recommendations.  I did all their recommendations and I think it would be bad for a serious company.  It adds creepy shit like &quot;watch grandma peeing&quot; and my keywords aren&#x27;t related to that at all.  It also isn&#x27;t accurate.  It says &quot;we estimate you&#x27;ll get 150 new clicks every day from now for x dollars.&quot; and I&#x27;ll get none or one.",1403353411

In some contexts, like the last expression in a function or other expression block, if you don&#x27;t use a semicolon it will return the value that the expression evaluates to. If you do use a semicolon, it won&#x27;t return that expression&#x27;s value. This is good, because it lets you avoid writing the &quot;return&quot; keyword all over the place, but it also lets you avoid returning a value with just a single character!",1403353377

To give an idea of how powerful heritability of social status/roles is consider this: Norman surnames are over represented among the battlefield casualties of WW1 and 2 for the UK. Nearly a thousand years later a prospensity for organised violence lives on. And despite the Cultural Revolution and 30 years of Communism, the same surnames that were over represented among the Mandarins of Qing China are over represented among the upper echelons of today&#x27;s Communist Party.<p>〉tl;dr = Generation 1 builds wealth from scratch, Gen 2 is inspired by the raw dedication of the first, but Gen 3 never meets Gen 1 and feels entitled and lazy and squanders everything.<p><i>Our youth now love luxury.

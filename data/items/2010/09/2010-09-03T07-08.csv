I don't need multimegapixel camera in phone. To share photo with friends on facebook or twitter 0.3MP is more then enough but processing of multimegapixel image is not easy task for small ARM processor, so you get very slow response at all phone photo capturing and processing applications and getting annoying delays.<p>According to desktop screen resolution you are lucky if you can get screen with more then 2MP resolution.

Off the top of my head I'd guess the Ardberg 10 is something like 20-40 ppm.<p>The ""ppm"", in the Scotch context, is for the amount of peat phenols, which is essentially a peatiness metric, and it is recently a competition metric, for some reason, between at least a few distillers  (

It was interesting to taste a Scotch intentionally that peaty, but I'd consider it more of a novelty than a great taste improvement.

We would be able to contribute quite a bit, we have already done some work in those areas. So  I was very happy while reading the description<p>until the ""GPLv3"" part.<p>People need to understand that a library project which is under GPLv2 or GPLv3 gets immediately rejected in most commercial settings. Note that I'm not judging here  just stating a fact. We reject a lot of interesting options because of licenses.<p>Of course, the authors of the library are free to choose whichever license they like. But choosing invasive licenses such as the GPL means that they will not benefit from our contributions and they will restrict the user base for their libraries to experimenters and academics. Less users, less contributions, less development, less popularity. Again, I'm not being judgmental  I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing, I just want the authors to be aware of this.<p>EDIT: I actually realized I need to write an article/blogpost about this, as many people are unaware of how software gets rejected upfront in a commercial setting because of the license.

In the grand scheme of things it may not matter: is node.js suffering (or likely to suffer in future) because it is tied V8? Would making node.js flexible about its JS engine add enough overhead that it is undesirable? It is certainly worth experimenting with other JS engines though, so they have answers to those questions (maybe is isn't worth it, but now that is known for sure, and maybe it <i>is</i> worth it and the benefits of a change (or generalisation) can be demonstrated with real examples).",1303382552

It doesn't matter whether you're ""selling"" in the sense of exchanging money or not.<p>Marketing is critical. And marketing isn't just telling people about it, or advertising. Marketing is making a site that is attractive (to the audience), giving your project a name that is easy to understand and remember, and easy to google for, and making it easy to use, to install, work with it, share it, troubleshoot it, making it easy to find help, easy to find other people who use it in a community. Marketing means making it clear as hell what the user gets out of your ""product,"" and keeping the focus on the user at all times.<p>These are all relative, depending on your audience. (Ex: Lots of developer types actively enjoy the simplest possible visual design, and enjoy the thrill of conquering something that's a little bit technically hard. But not all. And none of them enjoy searching & searching and being unable to find the thing.)<p>If you don't to make money off your work, great. But if you want people to use it, you have to market it, that's just the way it works. It's not good enough to simply make something you want to make and stick it out there. Just being ""free"" and ""open"" isn't enough.<p>If more open source developers would take the time to learn how to effectively promote their own work, the world would be a better place. But sadly, because most OSS developers belong to a group that considers marketing ""evil,"" and has a chip-on-the-shoulder reaction to the idea that marketing is required for even free-as-in-beer projects, it won't happen.",1303380066

Your child will feel angry about certain events, or about other people and so forth for whatever the reasons, but usually, it&#x27;s simply because they are hungry or feeling tired.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is when you observe how they are trying to find out reasons why they are upset, when basically, it&#x27;s their instinct/emotion that caused them to get upset. So you will notice the lack of consistency or relevance of their evidence in backing up their argument.<p>But this changes gradually as they grow older. They become more logical and more consistent. I think this is what most adult, or smart individuals learn to do as well.<p>It amazes me everyday to find myself rationalizing so many things and at the same time, persuading others using the same logic, when the other part of my brain secretly acknowledge/recognize that I&#x27;m making it sound all logical and trying to get others approval for my own sense of security.",1404186587

I learned according to what my teachers called the &quot;European&quot; method that focused on reading from the very first note.<p>However, what I&#x27;ve observed is that most American teachers don&#x27;t adhere strictly to Suzuki&#x27;s methods.

I have the book at home, though, so I can&#x27;t quote it here. Sorry. But the intuition is, if you have an infinite sequence of random numbers, then the numbers in all infinite subsequences should be equidistributed. So, like, if you a stream of random 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s, then if you pick only every other number, the 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s have to be equiprobable, and if you pick every third number, they still have to be equiprobable, etc. This is slightly wrong, but it&#x27;s on the right track to the actual definition.<p>re: Pseudorandomness, the point of pseudorandomness is the following.<p>1. A lot of algorithms use randomness to make pathologically bad cases extremely unlikely. For example, choosing a random pivot in quicksort makes the worst case <i>very</i> unlikely.<p>2. But in a lot of cases, this leads to huge amounts of space consumption. For example, most frequency moment estimations involve a matrix of random numbers. So if you&#x27;re getting those numbers from a &quot;truly random&quot; source, then you have to store the entire matrix, which can be huge.<p>3. So, a better solution is to use a pseudorandom number generator! That way you can store a seed of s bits, and do something clever, like deterministically re-generate the matrix as you need it, rather than storing it outright.<p>Notice though, that this is not independent of the notion of randomness!

Their margins on sales however are low.<p>Apple is a slightly different beast:  hardware, plus some software/information goods (largely entertainment sales).  And no, I haven&#x27;t peeked at their financials.  Profits on the hardware side are tremendous, though marketshare is relatively low.  Marketshare on their software/information sales (software, music, video, books, games) is higher, margins tend to be low.<p>Facebook is in the ads space, and lacks for intentionality though its&#x27; got a lot of loiter time.  People spend hours on the site (or can).  The focus should be less on transactions per page, as on opportunities <i>per user</i>.  Focus on detecting when someone&#x27;s in a purchase state and utilize that, as well, perhaps, as the relationships between users and vendors which can be provided.  Of all the majors, I&#x27;d say FB&#x27;s position is the weakest, and the degree to which the user experience seems to be deteriorating under increased conversion pressure seems to support this.<p>Of possible breakouts:<p>Google going into direct retail or direct retail partnerships, which seems to be happening with Google Shopping Express, could be a net win.  Google&#x27;s disadvantage is increasingly negative response to its data profiling.  Abandoning this for other bases on which to generate revenues would be an interesting move.<p>Amazon is a latent player in the hardware space.  To date I&#x27;ve found its tablet and e-Reader products unappealing because the&#x27;re too ostentatiously shopping malls thrust before the user.  A much, much softer touch would be more successful for me.  Jeff Bezos&#x27;s personality may be the company&#x27;s Achilles heel.  Amazon also have an interactive an online component through their forums (and product ratings) which might be leveragable into social space, though I consider that a very long shot.<p>Apple could branch into either retail or search.  It&#x27;s risk is getting out-competed in hardware, particularly in the iPhone/iPod space where Android is now eating its lunch.  On the other hand, there&#x27;s an opportunity in that Apple doesn&#x27;t rely on the intrusive surveillance that Android is predicated on.  <i>That</i> pivot is complicated by iOS being a closed rather than open operating system.  I see the opportunity being frustrated by Apple&#x27;s preference to keep its software platforms closed.  Its laptop and desktop market could grow at the cost of further decline of Microsoft, though challenged by Chrome devices.<p>Facebook has the most difficult transition of any of the four.  It&#x27;s not in retail, pushing advertising reduces the appeal of its other offerings, and it doesn&#x27;t have a hardware offering.  Yet.  That last could be a breakout, though again, I see this as a long shot.<p>Of the four, FB is the most likely to fail or decline.  Google is probably well-poised to retain king-of-the-hill status.  Apple is likely to remain as a center of the personal-electronics / entertainment market, though pinched by Android in small devices.  Amazon could be vulnerable to an open-platform based retail system based around or promoted by Google, though it would take a lot to topple it.  Expansion into devices would be useful but not a major game changer.<p>Other disruptive elements:  a decentralization of social networking space through open-protocol networks (e.g., Diaspora, Friendica), and self-hosting systems (e.g., FreedomBox).   A federation of search, whether through meta-providers (e.g., DDG) or truly federated search (YaCy).  An open handset or open hardware spec.  All of low to modest probability, but not impossible.",1404184049

This particular programmer is probably just the icing on the cake.<p>That said, if what you really want to do is fix the behavior of this programmer here is my suggestion:<p>- Institute mandatory code reviews for all commits for everybody.  There are any number of great tools for facilitating this and it is good practice anyway.  Not everyone has to approve every commit, but at least 1 person must thumbs up before it can be merged.<p>- On this particular programmers commit, you have to code review and comment on everything.  Say things like &quot;strongly typed objects are idiomatic C# code, we should follow that&quot; or &quot;this seems like it might have performance problems&quot; or &quot;hey I&#x27;d do that &#x27;this way&#x27;&quot;.<p>- If this is problematic, institute code standards <i>for the whole team</i>.  Have the terrible bike shed discussions and make him make his bad way the standard for everyone if he wants it.  This will enlist others in your cause (and probably make him realize how bad what he is doing is)<p>- Don&#x27;t let other people fix the bugs he introduces.  As soon as you find one, document it and give it to him to fix.  If the ORM is not providing value, his argument is valid, but likely he is arbitraging the pain of using the ORM initially by making others maintain his nonsense.  Don&#x27;t let him do that.<p>Four things can happen if you do this:\n- he gets tired of the crap and quits\n- he gets tired of the crap and gets you fired/to quit.\n- he gets better \n- he never gets better but the code isn&#x27;t impacted and you make it obvious to everyone on the team what a drag he is.",1432951159

However, nearly all of us have a cellphone that has a wireless charging mechanism; what if we were able to reverse that mechanism, so that something like a pant pocket was able to collect a small amount of energy from this process? Easier still, phones could be manufactured with small copper contacts on the back to do this the old-fashioned way. I realize that phone batteries are quite terrible in many cases, but this could change... or perhaps the process could be optimized to use such an irrelevant amount of energy required to keep the garment charged?",1432951050

Rather, it seems that the main problem is that we enacted policies with good intentions without considering whether the policies themselves were a good idea. In large part, I think this is true because as a society we are to a large distinguish between criticisms of a policy with criticisms of the stated goal of the policy. [1]. This led to a policy where it is possible for a single person (although in this case it was 2) to initiate the entire inquiry [2].

This law was secretly interpreted to allow the\nmass surveillance of who you talk to on the phone. Such information can be deeply intimate and private:\nConsider, for instance, what you could infer from a record of numerous calls to a local oncology center and\npharmacies. Section 215 is a pointless, expensive intrusion into the private life of every American.\nOn May 22, the Senate voted against extending Section 215. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has indicated\nhe will bring it up again for a last­minute vote on Sunday. I write to encourage local readers to ask their\nsenators, especially McConnell and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, not to extend these surveillance provisions\nbecause they run counter to the spirit and letter of the Constitution.\nYour say: Submit a letter to the editor (http://static.cincinnati.com/letter/)\nProponents of extending 215 claim we need more time for debate. We have had two full years for debate since the revelation in 2013 that American call\ndata is under total surveillance. And there has been vigorous debate. The difficulty in extending these provisions in the Senate reflects that. The\nextension of Section 215 is opposed even by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, who originally introduced it.\nIf you think that this infringement of civil liberties buys you security, consider that two reviews (by the President&#x27;s Review Group and the Privacy and the\nCivil Liberties Oversight Board) independently concluded that Section 215 has foiled no plots.\nMass surveillance has a chilling effect on freedom of speech and the press, freedom of association and thought. It lays the ground for the oppression of\nthese freedoms. Please call your senators and ask them to let Section 215 expire.\nPaul Henrich, Over­the­Rhine&quot;",1432950467
9628530,comment,9627280,9628151,0,0,jdmichal,,,"One of the best things Java brought to OOP was the idea of the interface. The idea that we can define the functional shape of the object we need, without defining anything else about it. I rarely find the need to use inheritance over interfaces in Java, especially when thinking in terms of Liskov and proper substitutability. The cases where inheritance is the correct decision is actually very rare, compared to the cases where it&#x27;s simply a convenient but ill-guided method of passing common data and functions around. As an easy example, the fact that `java.io.OutputStream` is a class instead of an interface. In my opinion, that was a bad decision made purely to provide default implementations of the `write(byte[])` and `write(byte[], int, int)` methods. It would have been better as an interface. I <i>really</i> like where Rust went in this regard with traits, especially the ability to define them external to the type itself.",1432950467

Less design surface area makes it considerably easier to learn in that respect. That doesn&#x27;t mean Haskell is easy to learn in general, for now.

This view is independent of the existence or non-existence of remote consoles. The implications of such a view are several. A utility must be dependable, more dependable than existing hardware of commercial general-purpose computers.

There is a weird splotchiness to the backlight, it doesn&#x27;t open past 100 degrees (so I&#x27;m often using it at weird angles, especially at conference tables), the 12&quot; 1080p display is either hard to read or doesn&#x27;t display enough text (I&#x27;ve tried all of the DPI and UI scaling settings and I&#x27;ve hit a middle ground that is marginally crap in all dimensions, without being complete garbage in any one), stylus is unusable, keyboard layout really sucks (Fn where Ctrl should be, so I have it swapped in the BIOS, but that breaks the End key, so I have to Fn+End to get regular End instead of Insert), detachable tablet feature is mostly just a novelty, the trackpad is really stiff and uncomfortable, and the touchpoint drifts on its own if you press it for very long.<p>Now, there are some obvious ways where the Surface line would do better than the Helix. The stylus is supposed to be beyond compare. That might actually make the tablet form more useful (and the Helix is not symmetrical in tablet form, which makes it a bit of a pain). And the quality of the display is much nicer. I wish I had just spent the extra $200 on the Surface Pro 2.<p>But even if I had, man, I think I&#x27;ve gotten over the 12&quot; screen size. One more inch doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but I find myself much more relaxed on 13&quot; screens these days (I guess I&#x27;m getting old). It&#x27;s also another inch of keyboard real estate, which again doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot until you start switching back and forth between two machines sitting next to each other.

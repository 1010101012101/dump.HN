10791238,comment,10788198,10791029,0,0,Skinney,,,"Google Closure is usable, but only if you write your app in a way that is google closure compatible, the same goes for any dependencies you pull in. In clojurescript, all code you write, and any pure cljs library, is google closure compatible.<p>Immutable.js is great, but your libraries probably doesn&#x27;t use it, and you have to make sure you use it everywhere as well. This can lead to subtle bugs that boils down to using .value instead of .get(&#x27;value&#x27;), a problem you&#x27;ll rarely encounter in cljs where everything is immutable by default.<p>I haven&#x27;t used systemjs/jspm, so I can&#x27;t say anything about that. I can only say that I have yet to encounter a case where figwheel doesn&#x27;t successfully reload my code, whereas I encounter this in webpack/react-hot-loader all the time.<p>ES6/ES7/Typescript are great improvements over ES5. But you have to pair it with Immutable.js for it to be comparable to the offering that cljs provides. Even then, when you have a setup that gives many of the same benefits as cljs, you&#x27;ll have written way more code, and you need to be a bit paranoid to make sure you&#x27;re using the correct API at the correct place, and that you don&#x27;t have any libraries that are incompatible with your setup.<p>In short. While you can have a setup that gives you all the advantages of cljs+om/reagent, it&#x27;s just a lot easier to do it in clojurescript.",1451051857

There are many distractions you have through the learning process. As for me, I spent an incredible amount of time on which language I should learn first, then found courses and books, and only after that I finally started to progress.

And by &quot;invest&quot; I mean, time, knowledge, money, exercise, food, whatever elements you need to leverage to maximize your health. Read a book like <i>Cholesterol Clarity</i> and understand how this cholesterol stuff really works.  If you&#x27;re a little overweight (or a lot) find a way to start getting more exercise.   Buy a bicycle, or a skateboard, or a surfboard, or just some comfortable walking shoes, whatever.  Throw out the Doritos and sugary sodas and shit.  Learn to eat healthy.  Quit smoking if you smoke.   That sort of thing.",1451048962

This is a large claim.</i><p>No, I&#x27;m saying that what IS has more substance than the myriads of things that we&#x27;re worried that CAN BE.<p>And, for this specific question mentioning the iPhone, I&#x27;m also saying that restricted, special purpose devices, which were ALWAYS sold as such (like mobile phones ever since the early nineties) are not the same as PCs which have other uses cases and history.<p>><i>Do you want a warning about the possible arsonist who seems to be stacking gas cans near your house?</i><p>Not when the only reason to think of them as &quot;arsonist&quot; is for stacking gas cans, when that also has another very logical explanation (e.g. he&#x27;s building a gas station).<p>In the case of Apple, they&#x27;re improving the security of OS releases, the same way Microsoft and other do. Sandboxes, secure modes, signed apps, are all standard things security researchers have been advising for years.<p>In all those years since they introduced signed and sandboxes apps, they never removed the ability to run non sandboxed and/or non-signed apps. So I also doubt they&#x27;ll remove the ability to turn off SIP, as it&#x27;s still needed for various use cases.<p>But even if they do change the SIP, no big deal for 99% of their customers. The rest can always use another platform, unless they value the (then) convenience, virus-tolerance etc of OS X more than they value the &quot;do everything with them&quot; openness of other platforms.<p>Just because some people started with a &#x27;assemble yourself&#x27; kit PC in the 80s, it doesn&#x27;t mean that the essence of having a PC is all about custom rigging it. And even more so, that was never the allure of Apple PCs (neither implicit or advertised). It was &quot;it just works&quot;.",1451048903

It seems like solving the O2 to Moon transport is a reasonable problem to tackle -- assuming we get people and gear up there -- albeit a lot of effort. How about the next outpost? And then the next? Do we continue bunny hopping O2 transports from Moon to Mars to Earth2... etc until there is a continuous supply of breathable air out from Earth? Or do we have a way to generate as we go further? Are we at mercy of Earth&#x27;s O2 supply? That seems like the biggest problem for leaving this planet.",1451048711

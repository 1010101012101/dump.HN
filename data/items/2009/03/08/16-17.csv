507323,comment,507272,507292,0,0,mdasen,,,"It is a great database, but replication is lacking.  Slony-I is the best of the bunch currently, but it works by using triggers, requires you to set it up for every table and key, scales quadratically, and just generally has a lot of overhead (when compared to MySQL's replication).  Mammoth Replicator is the most interesting project to me since it operates a lot more like MySQL's replication in that it works off log shipping.  Currently they only have a beta for download off their site (<a href=""https://projects.commandprompt.com/public/replicator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projects.commandprompt.com/public/replicator</a>), but I'm hopeful for it.<p>Replication is a really hard problem to solve given all the little inconsistencies that can creep in, but it's one of those areas that's holding PostgreSQL back most.  Hot failover and scalable read-only replicants are a big selling point for MySQL.  I really hope that PostgreSQL nails this area in 2010 because it's query planner is much better at handling complex queries (really, even something as simple as a sub-query).<p>But you're right, it it annoying that PostgreSQL doesn't have a nicer replication option.<p>EDIT: If performance isn't your biggest concern and you don't mind a highly tedious setup, Slony-I is reliable.  However, it's not suitable for larger clusters of machines since communication costs grow quadratically.",1236531349

They did the opposite. They set out to build a console that everyone else would love and buy, and which would make a solid profit for Nintendo. And they succeeded, big time.<p>Turns out nobody but console geeks cares about the architecture. And at a couple of hundred quid a pop, I'm sure most Wii owners will be more than willing to upgrade to a new version when the hardware is upgraded. They're not upgrading a small computer, they're upgrading a console.<p>PS3/XBox, on the other hand, have take the road of literally building a whole, powerful computer in a box. The market has shown that this is a less successful way to build consoles - whatever console geeks may have to say about it.",1236531305

507304,comment,507185,507220,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"I think your comment really points out the fact that Wii critics often miss the point entirely. I agree with the article, but don't see how that is going to affect its success.<p>Yeah, when you put it all together you have the software stack of a last-generation console, but so what? Most Wii gamers (those nebulous ""casuals"") are never going to use online multiplayer, download firmware upgrades, etc.; the person who I bought mine used from had no clue that it could get online. These people are not going to pass up a Wii because of these missing features; they are going to snatch it up from stores because it's got that bathroom scale you do yoga on, or that Super Mario Karts game where you turn the wiimote and it's like a steering wheel, or that tennis game we can play with our friends who, you know, we see in person. This all adds up to Nintendo having next-to-zero incentive to make the leaps and bounds their competitors are making in the firmware arena. The ""everything on the DVD"" approach is probably also a side-effect of the underpowered design they were aiming for at launch.<p>Perhap he's not trying to argue that the Wii sucks and will fail, and instead just making a purely technical argument. I'm grateful for the analysis because I don't pay much attention to consoles.",1236530387

507300,comment,507185,507288,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't think that the average Japanese programmer is any worse than the average American or European programmer.  They are all really bad.  For important stuff like this, you need to find the above-average programmers.  I know plenty of Japanese programmers that are above-average, so lack of supply is not the problem.<p>The problem with the Wii could come down to a number of things.  Perhaps the best programmers don't want to work inside a huge Japanese company.  (That is not the best place for creativity, and I doubt Nintendo is especially innovative in this respect.)  Perhaps this lack of extensibility was a design feature -- less stuff running at one time means less bugs (and less testing), and less demand on the hardware.  Both of those things make the system cheaper, which is what its target market wants.  (Remember that Nintendo makes money on each Wii sold, where that was not necessarily the case for the Xbox 360.)",1236530147

They've outsold the X-box 3 to 1 and the PS3 7 to 1, and unlike either of them, they're making a significant profit rather than subsidizing the hardware.

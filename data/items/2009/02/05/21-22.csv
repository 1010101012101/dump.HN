Path+subway every single day is $185/month (save $215), for a 23 min commute.<p>So using your numbers, you are $1000 over break-even. In reality, you are closer to $2500 over break-even.

I usually find myself either loving or hating what you say, and you have been prolific enough that I recognize your username and actively search for your comments on stories just to see what you have to say. As such, I'm more likely to vote on you than someone else that I haven't followed.<p>To me, karma is purely feedback on whether I said something of value. I could care less about the karma of others, and base my voting on the comment/submission, not who said/submitted it. I didn't realize until now that recognition is also a bias to my voting however.

Also U.S.NEWS ranks it at 400. Also their pass rate for the California bar is 6% lower than the state average. Those are all horrible numbers.<p>I was considering law for a while, and have done a little research into it. Basically law is a numbers game. Schools only care about g.p.a and LSAT scores. Law firms only care about where you went to school and your g.p.a if you went to a bad school. And the firms who care the most about your school's name also pay the most. So the difference in salaries from private law firms at a top ranked law school and a bottom ranked school can be as high as 100k.<p>Sure there are loan repayment programs at law schools for people who go into public service, but again it seems like the top schools are able to forgive the most debt.<p>So basically, that law school seems like it has a horrible rate of return, and it looks like Kellum was lucky getting 100k+ a year.

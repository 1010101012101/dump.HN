In my previous career (wireless and IC) I saw most patents as trivial for someone skilled in the arts: they were mostly byproducts of routine engineering design work. They were novel only in the sense that you are probably the first to work on a specific form. Yet they could appear rather deep and profound to the untrained eyes as you need a lot of training to be skilled in the arts in the first place. Can patent examiners truly judge the novelty of these patent applications?<p>And the funny thing is: if you come up with some real algorithm for some real hard problem it is unlikely that your algorithm can be protected by a patent, certainly not in its general form. The true algorithmic nature of your solution is likely too abstract and mathematical for a patent as patents do not protect laws of nature (physics and math qualify as laws of nature).",1377837818

In the standard flow, there&#x27;s no editor until the book (in a fairly complete and polished draft) is sold to a publisher.  A literary agent may read drafts along the way, but normally wouldn&#x27;t touch the text, just write up higher-level feedback.<p>On the other hand, the task of designing a narrative that flows well at the scope of a novel is really hard, and can take a lot of large-scale trial and error to improve.

It is an asymmetrical game wherein one player is the corporation who has a set of servers and is trying to advance adgenda cards while the other player is the runner, who is trying to hack into the corporation&#x27;s servers with a set of programs, hardware and other resources.  Like Magic, there is the actual game play, but then also the meta game play of picking cards to customize decks to play each role.<p>It shares the same designer as Magic (Richard Garfield), but is a Living Card Game rather than a Collectable Card Game.  The difference being that in Magic you spend tons of money hoping for the random drop of particular rare cards or buy them individually from dealers.  In A:NR, they release a new &quot;data pack&quot; about once a month and then have mini-expansions maybe once a year.  It&#x27;s more like a subscription model, but the net effect is that every card is worth the same as every other card.  Still not a cheap hobby, but capped, at least (maybe about $175 to buy every card ever made up to today).<p>Anyways, someone built a RESTy API for it as well: <a href=""http://netrunnercards.info/apidoc/en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netrunnercards.info/apidoc/en.html</a>",1377836687

I might post the resulting charts and stuff but when I did it out a few months ago it required 12,000 nodes. Entry/Exit are sufficient when also combining timing attacks but why not go whole hog? Also the increased security from new-identitying every few minutes increases the chance that at least some of your traffic would be caught while this type of attack is going on.<p>In reply to s_q_b: Amazon actually hosted this guy&#x27;s demonstration, so at least one good cloud provider has in fact done this. Additionally, if you time your attack correctly and don&#x27;t have persistent objectives, then it&#x27;s pretty much moot that the spike is obvious because who checks the total amount of nodes frequently while surfing? Finally, if you do have persistent objectives, then you could mask it by introducing nodes by the dozen or so randomly spaced over a year or two.<p>Edit: just to clarify: Not my paper. No one has commented to that effect yet, but I just realized that that could be a conclusion drawn. I&#x27;ve only done some analysis on this type of attack.",1377835430

724291,comment,723486,724249,0,0,jacquesm,,,"By your rules a community of mostly blue eyed people has something genetically wrong with them.<p>Funny how eugenics doesn't work whichever way you try to slice it isn't it ?<p>A gene being recessive or dominant and being expressed in a group of individuals is not immediately a sign of 'inbreeding'. By that standard we are all 'inbreeding', everybody will have a number of recessive genes expressed, even if that does not lead to them having a different phenotype.<p>Inbreeding refers to a population too small to have a viable sized gene pool, one of the traits is exposure of recessive traits.<p>You're confusing the cause and the effect. Not all recessive traits are exposed by inbreeding, the vast majority of them are regular recombination in a lively genepool.",1248605520

Given enough time and resources, practically any system will fall, typically due to human error (bad passwords being the biggest problem). I'd imagine more resources would be required to hack into a web server set up by a security company, but the rewards, in the form of publicity, for anti-sec are much greater.<p>Anyone who believes they can have a ""secure"" system connected to the internet is largely kidding themselves. There are ways to minimize this risk, but there really isn't any way (as far as I'm aware) to completely eradicate it.",1248603687

Voltage in cars varies from pretty low (sub-8 volts or so) when the starter is cranking, to around 14-16 volts when alternator is running against a fully charged battery, to the occasional high voltage peaks of 40V+ when, e.g., the air conditioner clutch disengages.<p>That's a pretty large range to run a current-driven device (the LED) from a fixed resistor. Most useful applications these days will use constant-current supplies that feed the LED a fixed amount of current as the input voltage changes all over the place.",1310072342

You'll be charged about $35 (the exact amount will be shown). Use it if you like, or shut it down right away. You can then start servers of any size using the ~$35 credit you have. It is important that you not be running a large server when the billing cycle rolls over, or you will be charged for a month of that, and this may result in an effective $35/month usage minimum (though credit does roll over).

2740250,comment,2740048,2740048,2,0,danudey,,,"Just had a discussion with some coworkers, and we settled on a conclusion, which may be beneficial or not.<p>Impulse buys are feelings, not thoughts (see Simon Sinek's TED talk<i>), so it really depends on your market and why they're buying your product. If it's the sort of thing that they'll do a ton of research on, compare other products, and then settle on a conclusion, then you should be fine either way.<p>If it's the sort of thing people will either impulse buy or forget about, then you may want to consider the issues involved with making a currency conversion.<p>1. When a user encounters a currency they're not familiar with (for many Americans, this is any non-USD currency), there's an immediate break in their purchase flow as they suddenly have to try to figure out what it's going to cost them. This requires math or research (most people don't know Google will do currency conversion), which gets in the way of their quick-purchase-then-off-to-facebook workflow.<p>2. When a user sees your product at (for example) €20, they see the number, they see that it's twenty, and they decide in a split second whether twenty is a reasonable price. When they realize that it's twenty </i>Euro* and the price is actually <i>thirty</i> of their local currency, then, despite their conscious awareness of how currency works, the price has effectively increased by 50%. This can hurt purchasing depending on how devoted they are to the service. Even if '30 of something' is a fair price, their brain got used to the idea of 'twenty of something' and now they stop and reconsider<i></i>.<p>This disjoint is especially noticeable at higher values; at €90, you're below the 'one hundred' threshold; at $135, you're suddenly above it.<p>One recommendation I can make is to provide an approximation of local currency. Figure out the user's most likely local currency, do an automatic conversion (e.g. to USD) and then round up. Give them a ballpark that's higher than their original purchase, but make it clear<i></i>* that it's an approximation, and the actual cost will depend on exchange rates and their bank's conversion fees (which will help hide any discrepancies). e.g. for €10, offer $15, even though the exchange is $14.348. Rounding up means that you never overcharge, but also that the user doesn't suddenly have to switch between currencies mentally.<p>* <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4</a>\n<i></i> There's a name for this, I forget what it is.\n<i></i>* …enough. Maybe a note like 'You are currently browsing in USD, but you will be charged in Euro. Currency conversion fees may apply.'",1310071754

I travel internationally quite a bit so I have a bank account and debit card (through First Republic) that gives me end-to-end conversion with no fees (no bank fees, no exchange fees, and refunded atm fees). In fact I usually get better than the going rate because my bank doesn't try to make money off the currency float.<p>Your USD option, on the other hand, almost certainly comes with exchange fees, and a slightly higher price to start with in order to cover your margins if the currency fluctuates. In real life I've found that I'd pay 5-10% <i>more</i> if I bought in USD vs the native currency.

There is a lot of research documenting the mental benefits of exercise, especially on aspects like focus, planning, discipline, etc. These are just the sorts of aspects the author found began to wane.<p>Therefore, I theorize that actually it was the decrease in regular exercise that caused the change, not a vague changing habit of ""completing things."" After all, finishing what you set out to do can often be beneficial, but it can also be foolish when it later turns out that what was begun was unwise or low-priority.<p>Something doesn't seem quite right about the ""always finish"" theory to me, since I know many very successful people make a point of being able to stoically change priorities when necessary rather than getting mired in pointless completion of no-longer-useful goals.<p>The hard thing is that although we ARE ourselves, we do find ourselves reduced to theorizing as to why changes in ourselves are happening-- looking around to find a cause.<p>How would one test the ""finishing things"" theory against the ""exercise increases focus"" theory? No problem-- try going back to a better exercise schedule but letting things slide as needed in non-health related areas. I predict it'll be fine, suggesting it's exercise/health specifically that is affecting habits, not some sort of ""getting into a bad habit of not finishing things"" effect.

2740140,comment,2730888,2731459,1,0,code_duck,,,"Personally, I don't see Google+ as an FB clone either. Awarding FB the 'rights' to social networking features is reminiscent of a non-deserved software patent - the functionality of FB is not unprecedented, non-obvious or original. Their success is in bringing it all together in one place successfully. Talking to friends and sharing materials with them is a natural way that people are going to use the internet.<p>When I heard about G+ my thoughts were along the same lines as the recent posts from MySpace's founder. Google has offered these services for years, but they have not been well integrated with each other or presented as a unified product. Overall Picasa, Buzz, Profiles and so on have not been branded or marketed well. Putting these together makes sense. I'm glad Google has done it and I'm pleased to see it's being well received.<p>What seems new for Google is how this is a 'real identity' network.  There's a key difference between communities where one can choose between a real name, anonymity or a pseudonym, exemplified by sites likes on YouTube, Reddit or your average random web forum, vs. the Facebook style where policy requires that you use your given name and have a single identity. Each style engenders a different dynamic, and has benefits or drawbacks. Maintaining the right to and acceptance anonymity on the internet is a quite important cultural issue in my opinion, however.<p>I definitely agree that Google and MS are very different companies, personality wise. MS's style is to copy competitors products, cargo-cult style, but miss the overall point. They seekt want to eliminate competition without really caring about the original point of the product - IE was just one in a long line of examples of this. They definitely don't care about improving the product after they eliminate the original, I suppose because the product or what it did was never the point. I don't think Google is like that at all... A company's behavior so often reflects the behavior of the people who run it at a high level, and the two founders of Google are not at all like Gates or Ballmer.",1310070134

2740073,comment,2738628,2739997,5,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>low standards for patent eligibility</i><p>I'm not sure if the standards are low, rather that the examiners don't abide by the rules set out by the USPTO. Novel and non-obvious are both requirements.<p><i>because the meaning of a patent’s claims are often not clear until after they have been litigated</i><p>This is another failing of current examiners.  The patent should be written such that one skilled in the art could reproduce it.  The patents are convoluted and unclear enough that one likely couldn't produce much of what is patented, because its not clear what the invention is. The examiners should make people resubmit patents, under time constraints, so that they are clear.  Much like submitting to a journal.",1310069167

In fact, they seem to try to hide which version you're on, so I don't think that this is a marketing gimmick at all. Chrome's release schedule has a lot more to do with the changing nature of user software and the Internet - version numbers shouldn't matter, all users should aim to run the latest version, and updates should come quickly.<p>These are all admirable goals and Chrome's versioning is just a side effect of newer software development methods. Chrome is perhaps on track to win the browser wars because it's the best browser and gets new features the fastest; IE's release cycle is still humiliatingly slow.",1310069151

Google is offering some limited mechanisms for controlling what you see (by assigning people you follow to circles) and who you speak to (by sending some posts to specific circles.) The OP wants to have the ability to let readers filter posts based on which circle the poster sent them to (i.e. subscribe to his tech posts or his german posts, or both.) I understand why that's valuable but I don't think he realizes that's probably a corner case.<p>It's also not clear why Twitter doesn't suffer from the same problem; he's saying he compensates by having multiple Twitter accounts, but that seems like a workaround rather than a feature.<p>Implementing what the OP suggests would likely increase the complexity of the Circles system a great deal while not adding a ton of value for most users; this is a classic case of what you can't design based on the most extreme needs of users without compromising your base usability.",1310068883

My 90-year-old grandpa hasn't ever used a computer; he used an old Microsoft WebTV since about 1998 so that he could send and receive email and pictures, and the only other things he knew how to do with it were check stocks and weather.<p>Apparently the last remaining WebTV portal server at Microsoft is getting dusty and flaking out sometimes, so we bought him an iPad (his vision is pretty good.)  We preloaded it with bookmarks to local news, stocks, weather, email, a few little reference sorts of apps, and a few games (e.g. he really likes Cribbage.)<p>At first, he was pretty skeptical, but we spent a few hours showing him all the stuff he could do with it, and he figured it out pretty easily.  Now he's perfectly happy with it and likes it a lot better than his WebTV.  I'm not sure if he really has a conceptual model of the Internet or anything, but he can do all the stuff he cares about easily.<p>The most amazing thing to him is Google Maps.  He could hardly believe that he could just flick around and see a picture of his house and our houses and all the houses of his friends.  I'm not sure he actually bought it when I told him that they drove a car around every street and took pictures.",1310068812

Many of us are working small companies and startups. The 4-day workweek is definitely a luxury I never could enjoy during my times in small startups.<p>Not only that, but a little bird inside 37s told me that the true 4-day work week works for only a few people at 37s while a few other people put in long, hard hours getting a lot of the tedious work of maintaining a body of software done.<p>If they keep playing at this, DHH is going to exemplify a new icon of the Pointy Haired Boss. The thing that's most frustrating about that is that DHH is actually pretty good at what he does (meaning framework capture), and if he focused more he'd be a lot better and we'd see a lot more good features out of products of 37s.",1219247425

281568,comment,281310,281501,0,0,thorax,,,"Philosophy (as I see it) is about asking big questions before science has a good answer. It's not about <i>tackling</i> questions as much as it is about posing questions and testing possible answers with logic before experiments or empirical evidence are available. Saying it has something to do with language parsing really sounds like a misguided generalization from some discussions.<p>For an example nearer to a hacker's heart, take the ""brain-in-a-vat"" concept:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat</a><p>While science can't simulate this (well) for someone we can ask quite yet, I believe there's value in thinking about the implications of a fully simulated reality. This discussion was more or less started in the 1600's before we had any sort of technology that could remotely get us near to this. We still can't explore it yet, but it's a valid question and it's an important discussion on subjective reality.<p>I think it's very healthy and productive for people to ask and explore deeper questions about reality. To pretend that you can't study things without experiments is taking the scientific method. True, experimental evidence is required (in my mind and for most educated folks in our era) to confirm or disprove even the most well-founded theories. Still, there is a very abundant space of theories that are nearly impossible to prove. I feel there's value in discussing them, building conceptual models, and reasoning about them before science is ready.",1219247393

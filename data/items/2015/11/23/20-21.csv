This way you can understand the pitfalls and best practices of certain systems (like infrastructure, queues, machine learning, angular, etc).",1448312387

I just wanted to make it clear this is not a toe in the water. :-)<p>> My understanding is this can be used as an interface to all WordPress blogs.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s correct. It works for WordPress.com blogs of course. But self-hosted blogs can also make use of Calypso by installing our Jetpack plugin (<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/</a>) which adds some API endpoints that allow Calypso to communicate with the self-hosted site.<p>> it is only steps away from peeling out the whole PHP layer for these interfaces<p>I don&#x27;t think I would go that far exactly. The php codebase is still there, and users can still use &quot;wp-admin&quot; if they prefer. And the API is also powered by PHP. But now that Calypso only communicates with a site through the API it allows us to separate the view logic and focus on making those endpoints as efficient as possible. I think it&#x27;s possible the API could be written in a language other than PHP. But that hasn&#x27;t happened yet and would be a significant task.<p>I should probably mention I am one of the authors, if that wasn&#x27;t obvious. :-)",1448312352

Call me sceptical. The only secular group we know of for sure is the Syrian National Army but Assad is their leader and he has been labeled Official Bad Guy Who Must Go.  (Just prior to the war HRC said she considers the Assads &quot;close friends&quot;.) Hmmm.... Former US pal Sadaam (secular despot) and the secular despot Gadaffi had &quot;to go&quot; too and look what that did.<p>At any rate, the &#x27;secular&#x27; fighters are now more often called &#x27;moderate&#x27; rebels. Hell, Al Queda (fighting in Syria as the Al-Nusra Front) is moderate compared to Daesh. Since 2012 they and other &#x27;moderate&#x27; Islamist groups received funding and weapons from the US, UK, France, Israel, the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia. Many of the arms ended up in Daesh&#x27;s hands anyway. One doesn&#x27;t hear a lot about the, at one point much lauded, Free Syrian Army except that many in their ranks have defected to Daesh.<p>The stuff I mentioned above is as close to factual as it gets in this chaotic war. The information comes from so-called reliable media sources with supporting documents provided. This doesn&#x27;t guarantee absolute truth of course.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how almost every person has strong opinions about the clusterfuck unfolding in Syria/Iraq and the role Daesh plays in it, but very few of those people actually have enough trustworthy information to make an informed opinion. The fog of war and the spread of disinformation, and just plain old misinformation, is as relevant here as in any other war.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that Senator McCain advocated supplying Daesh with weapons to shoot down Russian fighter aircraft and even had his picture taken posing with Daesh. The US and its allies and lackeys have a rich history supporting and arming extremely vile regimes and insurgent groups when it serves their interests.<p>The West provided the fertile soil from which Daesh sprouted and now the chickens have come to roost.

Very well done!<p>You won&#x27;t see that in the typical &quot;check out how cool promises are, async and fast all the things&quot;.<p>And promises indeed look cool, and make for nice short demos and they are easy to understand in short examples. Only when you start building a large applications based on them, where error handling has to be done, you start realizing they are bit like threads. Promise callback chains started from one event, can interfere with other promise callback chains that started from another event. And if they modify the same data, you now also have a race condition as well.<p>I would basically look at this statement &quot;In the synchronous world, it’s very simple to understand computations when thinking about functions: you put things into a function, and the function gives you something in return&quot; and follow through, but in a different direction -- pick the synchronous world if you can.<p>Sequential things should be sequential and concurrent things should be concurrent. Single request processing is sequential. For this request do x,y,z in order. Can&#x27;t do y unless x finished. Well sit and wait for x to finish. But requests themselves can be concurrent and run in parallel.  For example a request comes in, reads the database, updates the database, bumps metrics, makess other sub-requests and then responds. It is sequential and should be kept sequential. If you platform cannot handle that, think very well about your platform, and perhaps pick a better platform. What does that mean practically? It means picking green threads (Python gevent, eventlet), it means Elixir, Erlang, Go goroutines, Rust&#x27;s threads. Streams can be used as a higher level abstraction sometimes and so on.",1448311341

Gold, from a paper titled &quot;Language identification in the limit&quot; published in 1967 [1]<p>Gold&#x27;s result basically says that it&#x27;s impossible for a learner to learn a non-finite language (which means anything from regular languages and above) without access to an infinite number of examples, both positive and negative, of the language, or failing that, access to an oracle that knows the language perfectly and can confirm or reject the learner&#x27;s evolving model of the language. In some versions, the oracle must respond to errors with a <i>negative</i> counter-example, teaching the learner why its model is wrong (&quot;if the sentence you just formed was correct then you could form this other sentence, which is obviously wrong&quot;).<p>As far as I know, Gold&#x27;s result still stands. So I think you may be overestimating the power of the python script you link to.<p>I should say that I&#x27;m aware of Karpathy&#x27;s project, and it&#x27;s really cool (or awesome if you prefer), but reproducing text is not the same as learning language.<p>In other words, if you expect any program to learn language, you better have infinite data to train it with and also an infinite amount of time. I stress that this doesn&#x27;t only apply to human languages. You can try teaching a network to learn the syntax of Java, for example. You&#x27;ll still need infinite resources, or an Oracle.<p>++ Edited to remove unfortunate scare quotes and also to add: if you could machine-learn a language, even &quot;just&quot; a CFG, we wouldn&#x27;t need to write parsers for programming language compilers anymore. It would suffice to present a machine learning algorithm with some examples (a lot of them probably) and the algorithm would form a model of the language, that we could then use as a parser.<p>This is far from the state of the art today, however.<p>__________________<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/~6.863/www/spring2009/readings/gold67limit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/~6.863/www/spring2009/readings/gold67limi...</a>",1448311286

It can happen, and even if &quot;team player&quot; is often misused as a politicized HR code word, most of us developers still do want to be team players in the real sense, and so helping out is not a problem.<p>But if the issue lingers over time, either because the small company doesn&#x27;t want to foot the bill to hire an appropriate specialist, or because the company tries to paper over the wrongness of the on-going situation by acting like this sort of &quot;team player&quot; working-outside-my-speciality-because-someone-claims-it&#x27;s-urgent status is just &quot;how start-ups work&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s just start-ups&quot; or &quot;everyone&#x27;s got to wear many hats&quot; or whatever other bullshit, then that&#x27;s a huge red flag.<p>It means that not only did the company fail to plan for its needs (which should be some cause for concern, but not catastrophic since start-ups are hard), but even more, <i>after</i> learning that they didn&#x27;t plan staffing correctly, instead of considering the deleterious burnout effects it might have on a specialist to force them to work way outside their area for prolonged times, the company just doubles down on it and even tries to build their company culture around it, as if &quot;just do what you&#x27;re told, no matter how hilariously far off it is from what we said you&#x27;d be doing&quot; is a centerpiece of company culture, and indeed that somehow that&#x27;s &quot;just how it is&quot; at any start-up.<p>So, even if there is no intentional deceit or planned bait-and-switch, it&#x27;s <i>still</i> a big red flag if this happens a lot and/or doesn&#x27;t get resolved quickly.<p>If you are a specialist, any employer who doesn&#x27;t care enough about your specialty to be sensitive to the request to make you work way outside of it is really bad news for your career, unless you have other reasons for wanting to work there that, for you personally, supersede however much you value career progress in your chosen specialty.<p>At the very least, companies should be apologetic about this when it happens, and should really work to find a compromise that doesn&#x27;t cause burnout or create big gaps of time on an employee&#x27;s work history during which the employee is not gaining experience related to their actual career specialty. If managers can admit the situation is not ideal, and level with you about the business emergency causing it, that&#x27;s somewhat better (though still not an excuse for it to linger on for a long time). But if the business can&#x27;t be bothered to admit they are doing something <i>really</i> suboptimal, something specifically fucking with your career progress and ability to gain experience, then it&#x27;s probably time to just move on to another job.

You need to command loyalty from a group of people that can safeguard your place in the nation. Not just an army, but also groups of people who can fund and support that army. It&#x27;s as true for a tiny island nation as it is for the USA. European colonialism had outsized effects on the Caribbean for that reason, way easier to keep a nation of 10,000 under your thumb than to control millions.<p>The CIA has resources comparable to a small army, but it must project these resources thinly across all the countries the US wishes to influence. It can buy guns and train limited numbers of rebels, but it cannot create a ruling party where before there was none. It can alter the course of politics in a nation, but that influence can&#x27;t come close to actual control unless the nation is very small.<p>Once in awhile they got lucky, and their group of trigger-happy idiots overwhelmed the other group of trigger-happy idiots. It&#x27;s arguable as to exactly how much damage this does. Obviously it has a negative effect, political chaos is generally worse for a people than stability. Try to measure the effects in aggregate though, and comparing them to what would have happened otherwise, and it&#x27;s hard to really tell.<p>Political upheaval can destroy individual lives, but generally the industries underneath are left alone, it makes no sense, say, for a rebel group to destroy farmland, or a factory. Your efforts are much better directed at military targets, you&#x27;re going to want that factory to keep making things once you&#x27;re in power, being needlessly destructive hurts your interests too.",1448310908

For me (<i>Although I know it also applies to a few other people I know</i>), the sole goal is learning and experimenting -- a working project is just a bonus. Occasionally I&#x27;ll code a tool to make life easier, but it&#x27;s not the be-all-and-end-all.<p>>  When I pursue a project, I work on it in terms of 10s of thousands of lines of code over a 2-4+ year span of time.<p>It&#x27;s great that you have the energy to do that, but I (<i>and I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else here</i>) simply don&#x27;t have the energy to devote my time to a single project over a long period of time.

I also got a lot of bad credit-fixing &quot;advice&quot; that actually wouldn&#x27;t help me at all - Get another (better) credit card! Take out a personal loan! Reconsolidate student loans! (when all mine were already consolidated at a low rate with EdFinancial). Overall, a bad experience that were clearly just ads/referrals that made me never want to use LendingTree again. Who knows what they have done with my personal and financial data.<p>In the end, I went with a local bank, and secured a mortgage with no hassles at a much lower rate than the only LendingTree &quot;offer&quot; (ad) for Quicken Loans gave me.<p>If you&#x27;re shopping for a mortgage, just call a few local banks and credit unions.

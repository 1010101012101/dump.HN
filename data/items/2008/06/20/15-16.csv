One paradigm I use a lot is when I need to change a variable name... this is very easy. While on the variable itself, press * to search forward for it. Then type cw to erase the word and type in the replacement, followed by ESCAPE (of course). From then on, you can use n to find the next occurrence and then type . to change the name, because . repeats the last command.<p>Oh, and one last thing. Remap ESCAPE to CAPS LOCK, or get used to using C-[. Both are more convenient than reaching for the top corner; CAPS LOCK is superior in my experience, but it will kill you when you're on a non-mapped system.",1213975017

How does del.icio.us make money? By selling marketing data compiled from tagged urls. Flickr didn't start with a clear revenue model, but they can pay most of their bills from the ~5% of users who have a paid premium account. Even craigslist, the paragon of free services, makes a significant amount of money by charging for job listings in a few select markets.<p>Matt makes some excellent points, and I believe him that the future is probably going to be dominated by smaller companies with low profit margins as opposed to venture backed behemoths. But it doesn't change the fact that it's difficult to NOT make money with a ""wildly popular"" product.<p>If you have a growing website with hundreds of thousands of happy users, you will find a way to make money. I run a website that is mildly popular on occasion and believe me, we get emails. Every few weeks someone will come to us and suggest ways that we can make more money. The more popular the website, the more opportunities you'll find to make money on it. I don't think that Mint or YouTube will close their doors any time soon.

I think there is a sizable wing of HN readers who don't care as much about business and startups as they care about interesting or  powerful and novel technological ideas-- and are interested in startups only subordinate to those interests, to the extent that these businesses advance and put into practice new and useful ideas.<p>That said, the pornography aspect is not inherently wrong in my view.  I certainly understand and respect (to varying degrees) the various moralist arguments from different corners of the political spectrum.  Interestingly it is divided in at least 4 ways.  Libertarian pro-porn, conservative religious anti-porn, liberal feminist (protection of women) anti-porn, and anarchist libertine third-wave feminist pro-porn.  While I would morally agree most strongly with the fourth stance that is both pro-woman and sympathetic of (some but certainly not most) porn, inasmuch as it is compatible with the some of the very real concerns of category 3 (to the extent that they are applied legitimately and not as a masked version of category 2), pragmatically I consider pornography, let's say ethical/tasteful artistic or even non-commercial crowd sourced/community-contributed pornography (just for the sake of argument), to be more of a distraction than anything else, despite being morally good.",1213974456

There is a lot of business opportunity surrounding pornography. As it is, it's just a top 10 list of porn sites, Which is one step from being a link site.

222785,comment,221991,222599,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The very last assignment was to use lex and yacc to compile the same language that we had spent the whole quarter writing a compiler and simulator for. The point of the class (""Compiler Design and Implementation"") was not to learn the quickest way to write a compiler, but to learn about the common methods used in writing compilers (REs (finite automata) for the lexer, and LL, SLR, and LALR parsers for the compiler). Since this is precisely how lex and yacc work, someone coming out of the class would have the knowledge to port lex and yacc to another language or to perhaps even improve upon it.<p>As for saying that lex and yacc ""implement DSLs"", that is a huge simplification of what they do. A large part of the work of lex and yacc is generating the tables and the engine code that are used to translate characters to tokens and token sequences to parser rules.

State and local budgets have been strapped since 2002-2003 or so, all the way through the supposed ""boom"", and it got worse after the collapse.<p>The stimulus bill, for example -- it was like 40% tax cuts, had a bunch of earmarks, but the local aid that would've helped teachers was what got stripped out in order to get the last couple votes.  Congress can reduce the deficit by cutting state aid.  States can balance their budgets by cutting local aid.  School districts get stuck with the lack of funding from their congressman's admirable devotion to balanced budgets.  In between voting for putting 2 wars and a $50 million senior center for his district on the credit card.<p>I'm just giving you the truth - you can accept it or not.",1280329106

Just this summer I installed Ubuntu 10.04 desktop on a computer running a relatively new ATI card (It was top of the line a couple years ago, I believe). While in general use its fine, there are plenty of really annoying issues. Unfortunately for us, as we were attempting to use it as a media center, there were significant issues with full screen video, where it would freeze up for 5 - 10 seconds at a time every minute or two. This is a known issue for the entire series of cards, and is a driver bug, but hasn't been fixed in the 1+ year that the issue has been open. Then there are other smaller issues with the card such as a 5 second delay maximizing a window, if you're using compiz. Not a deal killer, but still annoying, and there were a few similar bugs like this. After this incredibly sour experience with ATI, I'm not sure I'll recommend them again for a long time. And I haven't even gotten into how long I had to fight with X just to get dual monitors to work.",1280329082

But seriously I need you to move to new york :) So few startups here, I blame you, the people coming up with ideas in California.<p>I worry about your business model though. It seems nice to be able to safe a thousand or more dollars on wedding invitations BUT here are the problems:<p>1) When a wedding costs 25k, saving 50-500 bucks on an invitation is going to be looked at as stupid, and cheap. You want the one that takes the most hassle out of it.<p>2) A big part of the invitations is the printing/mailing. If only the design was the only factor.<p>3) Often catering halls (im from new york) will do everything from getting the place, getting the catering, getting the flowers, getting the invitations and sending them out, its a full-blown package.<p>The real way to go about this is to have people design their invitations in an awesome way quickly before their wedding, get hooked to it, and already have that in mind.

Obviously no website UI can ever cover absolutely all cases and some queries will need to reach a human, but most companies don't even seem to try. Even if there's a form for other queries it's usually one big text box rather than the more specific questions staff would ask you on the phone. The worst part are the responses combined from canned text blocks, which tend to make no sense at all and don't solve any problems. Or even better, online queries being ignored altogether, or receiving an automated ""please call"" reply.<p>One exception to this (in my experience) is amazon. Their help section is pretty comprehensive, each shipment has associated actions you can take which are context (status) dependent and if you do have a specific request it's ridiculously impersonal but very efficient.",1280328944

Especially scary if you live in a state where Thomas Jefferson has been struck from the books because the board of education has an ideology to push, and is unconcerned with teaching truth.<p>So if you ask most teachers, they support this sort of thing totally, and therefore the unions would too. But only if they receive assurances that standardized testing - an enemy of free thought - is a minimally important part of the evaluation system. Peer review is the ideal.<p>Now, this obviously still brings charges of cronyism, and it certainly will create cliques of teachers, but only rarely cliques of bad teachers.

That means Lombok may break with every minor release of the java compiler, which means it will be hard to justify introducing it. I certainly didn't dare introducing it with any of my clients, back when I was still writing Java.

I've memorized my interaction sequence with the German rail ticket machines to the point where I can get a ticket in 25 seconds. No desk service is that fast. Also, I don't have to deal with potential human unpredictability and communicating what I want. My interaction with the machine is already in muscle memory, and I don't feel rude when specifying things with extreme precision. Getting a specific  seat on a plane is a multi-step operation at a checkin counter. Some clerks ask you if you want an aisle or window seat, but sometimes act offended when I ask for seat 3C. Some don't ask at all, and print out the boarding card before I can complain (not that it's a big deal where I sit, but it's a factor). Poking the 3C box on the self-service machine allows me to disregard the mood the clerk is in and get what I want. I feel more in control, and don't feel like I'm being a difficult customer. When I first moved here, I had a major language problem, so having machines with a language switch helped me a lot. But even now that I speak the language fluently, I still prefer automated experiences. The article has a point, there are a number of people in my life I care about, but bank tellers and checkin clerks are not important to me. I'll be nice to them when I encounter them, but I much prefer not having to interact with them. After all, they are entering the same stuff into the machine as I would, ideally.",1280327004

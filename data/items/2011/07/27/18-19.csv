One major advantage they have, which works for their favor is that they use the script on pages they control, where as my approach is trying to get this working on any page, regardless of who created it with as bad CSS/HTML as they did. If you aren't gonna be using z-index positioning, no letter-spacing, no CSS3 properties, no HTML5 form elements etc. it can be very easy to make matching screenshot to the page.<p>For IE<9 the Flash option won't have to be the only option either, a server could be rendering the elements gathered from the users browser (in other words a canvas proxy for the canvas renderer).<p>In terms of my script, the aim is to try and get the compatibility down to FF3, IE6 (with non-canvas support through flashcanvas or server canvas), Opera (haven't looked much yet how old version would be able to support it), and Chrome.",1311792894

But first things first, remember that it isn't odd for employees to own around 10% of the business IN AGGREGATE after dilution with senior non-founders taking up to 2%. Double that number if there are no outside investors, and do the math based on whatever your company is worth. Then divide by four to factor in vesting....<p>If those numbers don't make you happy, the problem is that your company isn't valued at the speculative 5-10 million that would make what you are asking for reasonable. Assuming the business makes 100k a year, we can guesstimate you want at least 10% of the value of the company for a single year's work. That might be fair or it might not be, but it's clearly disproportionate given the time and risk the others have already put in.<p>Where does this leave you? In my opinion as a business owner, the best way to get around this is NOT to haggle over the valuation of the company because you have no control over it and neither do your partners. By all means throw the ball in their court and see what they offer, but whatever they come back with remember that you can probably do better by linking your ownership to growth and the amount of new revenue you drive. This will be easier for them to agree to since they'll only give up more ownership if the company performs better thanks to your work. And assuming your work makes the company money - you will be able to push your stake in the business much higher than you would get otherwise as an employee, possibly even up to founder levels.",1311792747

It would be hugely lopsided in favor entities with lots of money, since the value of your invention <i>to you</i> (but not to potential infringers) is bounded by your cash on hand. The cost of getting a patent is already a hardship on non-corporate inventors. They won't be able to afford a lot on top of that — the ROI would just not be there.

2813543,comment,2812313,2812313,1,0,netmau5,,,"We live in a capitalistic society. I'd like to think that means IF !STOLEN THEN PAID and its contrapositive IF !PAID THEN STOLEN. Patents say IF USED THEN STOLEN. Companies tend to license these patents into their capitalistic form for many reasons, but the fact that they have a decision in the matter allows for monopolistic behavior.<p>I believe all patents should come with a required provision that lists a fair market value for licensing it which anyone can use, thus IF !STOLEN THEN PAID. In turn, this forces the USPTO to actually quantify (to some degree of error) the ""useful"" requirement of a patent and, by small extension, if it is ""statutory"" (product or productizable) and ""nonobvious"" (existing competition?). I think it also forces the requestor to give some detail on the intention of the patent rather than making an arbitrary claim to an underlying concept.<p>It's all about the money; they need to stop pretending and judge it that way.

And before we say ""hey, we all have to be polite here on HN,"" his articles consistently take shots at anyone and everyone he disagrees with in a disrespectful manner. Terms like ""knuckle-dragger"", ""pseudo-scientific slime"", ""Mr. Smarter-than-thou"", ""flowering of this idiocy"", all reek with contempt of his straw-man opponents.<p>To address this particular article: the writing is all over the place. First paragraph: he doesn't like science when it's a ""club to beat up people you simply disagree with."" Well, good, reproducible scientific results can indeed be used as a ""club"" to beat up ideas that are wrong. It's one of the best uses of science. Now my assumption (from reading further) is he hates bad science. Which I actually agree with, but that is not stated up front.<p>From the fourth paragraph. ""...science is the beautiful application of reason and logic that slowly and inexorably moves from ignorance to truth."" The next paragraph says ""Bullshit."" What's bullshit about it? That is indeed how good science should work.<p>Then he goes on to talk about scientists who speculate outside either their area of expertise, or outside scientifically produced results.<p>Later he says ""It needs to be clear when reporting medical studies what types of methods were used..."". Here's the deal: it is clear. It's clear in reputable scientific journals. Read by scientists that can actually make sense of that kind of information. And even then, as a reader, you have to use critical thought to mentally junk studies that don't follow appropriate methods. Reading the most reputable peer-reviewed journals is a start, but you can't shut your brain off while reading even those.<p>If he's talking about newspaper reporting about science, yes, it's frequently wrong, because it's written by non-scientists. As an exercise, read a regular newspaper article about anything you have deep knowledge in. I'll bet you find many problems with it based on the lack of understanding of the reporter.<p>In his last paragraph, his conclusion seems to be that scientists should do good science, and not bad science. Again, this is what peer-reviewed journals contribute greatly to. It's not a ""totally new way of doing things"". Not even close.",1311792677

So single payer health care is not optimal if you value freedom of choice.  If your only criteria is cost, then we should just make all doctors and nurses slaves, because that is cheap.",1311791835

Didn't do particularly awesome work.  Quit after ~18 months.<p>- Took 6 months off. Made actual friends (I moved to Seattle not knowing anyone) Went to burningman for the first time.<p>- Found a job at a small startup called PureNetworks on craigslist.  Stayed there about 2 years. Did pretty good work, but the company didn't do so well.  Management got changed over and I got fired (which kinda scared the hell out of me) after showing up to work super late one day (like 3pm) after going to Vancouver to party the night before.<p>- Interviewed with some random companies in Seattle including Amazon. Got referred to Google through a friend and interviewed with them as well.  Ended up taking the Google job & moving to NYC.<p>- My GOOG options did pretty well (I started a cpl months before the IPO) but def nowhere near ""fuck you money.""  Spent 5 years @ Google working on couple different things.  Did pretty good work.  Met @dens and worked on Dodgeball for a while before it got canned.  Spent my last 18 months at Google semi bored kinda looking around for something new/smaller.<p>- After @dens & @naveen got foursquare up and running they brought me on as the first hire. Now I'm running the server engineering team (about 35 folks...and PS we're hiring!  <a href=""http://foursquare.jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foursquare.jobs</a>).<p>So, how did I get here? Worked hard. Picked up both small company and big company skills (learned much super valuable knowledge working on large scale infrastructure at Google) but also caught some good breaks.<p>Advice: work hard, learn a lot about a lot of different things. Network like hell. Networking will get you good breaks. It'll also help you recruit once you're running a team. This is vital. Keep a file of every smart person you ever meet in your whole life.

Often by accepting higher risk (e.g. accepting the risk of letting strangers into your apartment) you can get higher reward (e.g. some money, a sense of community and connection, etc).  But risk is risk, and so you can also get anti-rewards, sometimes huge ones (home ransacked and burglarized and vandalized, identity stolen, sense of life violated, etc).<p>If you want to draw conclusions from events like this, they should be about modulating your risk tolerance, not about setting your risk tolerance to zero (which is incoherent anyway).  You might decide that although things like this happen, it's a risk you're willing to take.  Or maybe not.  You might decide that if you're going to rent your apartment out to sight-unseen strangers, you're going to put all your identity documents in a safety deposit box first, to slightly limit the maximum damage.  Or you might decide that that would offset the benefit too much, and thereby just go back to the no-renting-to-strangers option.  Or you might decided to take martial arts lessons, and not let strangers in.  Or you might decided to install security cameras, with real-time transmission to offsite backup, so that if something bad happens you'll always be able to strike back and regain a sense of control.  Whatever.  All of those options are coherent alternatives, and all are a far cry from 'never leave your own home, never let anyone in'.<p>It's certainly true that simply walking down the street requires trust, and it's certainly true that transforming strangers into friends is a process that requires risking trust, but both of those _can_ be done with very small trusts.  Or they can be done with large trust, which has greater risk, greater possible reward, and greater possible injury.",1311791510

It actually works fine in Internet Explorer 9, and has no IE9 (or 8 or 7) specific code in it. This is actually the second time that Chrome has been the stand-out browser for causing issues when building a site (unless you count Opera - I don't).",1311790373

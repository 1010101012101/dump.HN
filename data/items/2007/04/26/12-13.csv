However, the SEC doesn't seem to have a problem with this.  After all, the massive fines they levy against companies (reducing future shareholder returns) accomplish the same thing.<p>Regardless, just because Jobs is valuable to the company shouldn't mean he's above the law.  It's my understanding that CEOs convicted of securities fraud can still serve their post, assuming their not in jail.",1177592267

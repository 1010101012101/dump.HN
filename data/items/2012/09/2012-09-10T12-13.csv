4499499,comment,4499242,4499473,1,0,NickPollard,,,"As someone living in London, I would generally agree with this - compared to a lot of places, London does seem to have a lot of housing in quite bad repair.<p>To take a wild guess why, I would suggest two factors:
1) The housing stock is old compared to a lot of places, so much of it needs modernization and renovation
2) The lack of space to expand (plus restrictions on greenfield developments) means new housing is limited, so there is not much competition to existing landlords. Why spend thousands of  on upgrading your property if you can leave it as it is and still charge high rents?",1347281969

It's just a minor market amoungst many, and IMO, not any less perverse and odd.<p>Complaining about porn not being real is similar to claiming soccer isn't real. ""Real people don't run that fast."" ""He's just trying to impress the cameras."" ""What he just did was super dangerous."" But it is real, because those are human beings having sex, so if ""real"" as a word has any meaning, it's real. But the word is being used as a prescriptive code as in the phrase ""real women,"" which simply means ""women who are not thin.""<p>Just because models being used in ""real"" campaigns are not thin does not make them representative of the general population - they are more attractive, their bodies in rarer proportions, they are still <i>thinner</i>, and they lack the actually thin - because 'real'ness is simply a reaction to thiness. The usage of the word ""real"" in that industry is simply disguising that reaction as a call to authenticity, something that advertisers have done since the beginning of advertising.<p>If the models were as the general population, why would anyone pay to look at them? If professional footballers played the same game as wekend footballers, why would anyone pay to look at them? If people in porn looked like you and your girlfriend and had sex like you and your girlfriend, why would you pay to watch?<p>If ""real"" models become the standard, and you are a thin person, will you have to go underground to find representations of people like you in the media?<p>I'm just being silly, though. This clarion call for real porn is cyclical, and predictable in its failure - because that market is already being pandered to, and because most people would rather have real sex tham watch it. We have terms for people who want to watch averagely attractive people have average sex within a loving relationship. Peeping Toms.",1347281308

She told me she had a filmmaker friend who was having trouble screening an art movie he had produced about East Asian sexuality. He had been claiming establishment discrimination is working to suppress his expression of the sexuality of a key demographic.<p>Thinking it was an interesting topic our conversation went something like:<p>Me: East Asian sexuality? That's a pretty focused topic.<p>Her: Yeah, he had a hard time getting actors who would have sex with each other on film.<p>Me: So....it's a porno?<p>Her: No! It's an art film!<p>Me: But they <i>actually</i> had to have sex on film?<p>Her: Yes! Of course for authenticity! It's about the ways in which East Asians feel their sexuality is repressed compared to the West!<p>Me: Compared to the West?<p>Her: Yeah! The West is so open about sexuality, L.A. is the home of porn, Playboy is from the U.S. etc. etc.<p>Me: You...are aware that something like 50% of all porn on the planet comes out of just Japan. A country with half the population of the U.S. and several countries in East Asia tend to be visited by foreigners almost entirely for sex tourism? There are several studies that indicate the ready availability of cheap pornography catering to just about any proclivity imaginable has been a major contributor to the declining birthrates in the more developed East Asian economies? If anything, much of East Asia is oversexed!<p>Her: ???<p>Me: It sounds to me like your friend just wanted an excuse to make a porno, but saying it was an art film kept it from being part of the seedy underbelly of society and gave his project an air of legitimacy. He didn't, by chance ask if you were interested in acting in it were you?<p>Her: Yes, he did. <i>sigh</i><p>So, I think people who are interested in the titillating parts of porn, but who are turned off by the various associations it has, will jump through all kinds of mental hoops to pretend that various attempts at it, perhaps by coming through non-traditional channels, are in fact <i>not</i> porn when they most certainly <i>are</i>.",1347281180

Almost all except the very top of the market (over 2000GBP per week, and there are few flats that expensive) appear so terrible... Is that only London or all of the country is like that? Why? Something like tax laws making it prohibitive to renovate housing? Why there is still a lot of 100+ years old rotten houses in London, definitely bearing no historical significance, their planning clearly showing they were build before electricity? I was very surprised since i came from a country many times poorer than the U.K. and yet the housing stock looks so much better there.",1347281012

4499422,comment,4491554,4493502,1,0,ithkuil,,,"Although many of the problems (i.e. seek time) of rotating disks are overcome by solid state persistent memory, you still need special datastructures to ensure that:<p>a) data is buffered during write and that a power failure won't leave the storage in an inconsistent state
b) blocks to be overwritten are reallocated and erased in background (you cannot simply overwrite a flash block before erasing it)
c) the used datastructures (trees etc) are optimized for the size of the flash block
d) gracefully handle block corruption<p>Since it should be possible to remap blocks (either because of (b) or corruption (d)) it's common to have a logical block remapping layer somewhere in the (disk) controller. At this point classical filesystem algorithms and datastructure can easily solve the remaining problems (consistency with journaling and block optimized access  like on rotating disks).<p>Of course, there is another approach for solving (b): see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system</a>
(actually, log structured filesystem technique can be used to implement the block remapping within the ssd compatibility layer which lies inside the disk controller itself, but that's a detail)
or copy on write filesystems like zfs/btrfs etc (although AFAIK they rely on a disk interface which is compatible to a rotating disk).<p>That's to say that solid state storage is not really just persistent ram where you can apply the same datastructures and procedures you would use in core.<p>Future technologies might be different and trim down these differences so that you could really have huge amount of super fast word addressable random memory access, where nothing can be lost even in case of power failure. But, even assuming that this might be possible, it's possible that later there will be yet another technology with even better storage density/ cost but which will introduce back some of the complications. So, it's understandable why you want to keep some abstractions, so that you can easily replace the underlying technologies and get most of the benefits.",1347280758

Most startups discussed here don't have the option to provide the non-scallable phone support either, so it is a very relevant problem.<p>Hiring 1000 people in a support center in India is a very un-googly thing to do, so I guess Google will keep the prices low and persist educating their customers to be able to use the services themselves. Maybe someone can invent a better way to do just that.",1203699520

121373,comment,121192,121192,0,0,giardini,,,"The author's thesis:\n""I really would like to challenge the conventional wisdom that stored procedures are the best and/or that hand-crafted SQL is the only way to achieve good performance.""<p>The author is obviously confused.<p>Both stored procedures (SPs) and dynamic SQL queries are ""hand-crafted"". Any  craftsmanship difference between the two is the level of craftsmanship of the code author. In most shops SPs are written by more experienced SQL coders, usually a good thing.<p>In current databases (IIRC SQL Server also) execution plans are created at runtime for SPs as well as for dynamic SQL queries. So dynamic SQL has no guaranteed efficiency advantage arising from an updated execution plan.<p>Other advantages of restricting developers to use of SPs:<p>Security -  SPs allow access control. By restricting developers to using SPs a DBA can restrict users and developers to particular operations/tables/fields.<p>Efficiency - SPs execute inside the database engine. Minimal network I/O (if any) is required. But a series of dynamic SQL operations may require moving the data outside the database proper, mandating record locking, network I/O, etc.<p>Maintainability - SPs allow data hiding. The DBA can restructure the database internally without requiring application rewrite.<p>Consequently any dynamic SQL operation can be rendered more efficient by rewriting it as a SP.",1203699290

How is that not dragging down what would otherwise be a sphere of creativity of landlords going out of their way to provide greater value to renters (to increase their profits) if the regulations were removed?<p>Also, how does the fact that the US economy does well in comparison to other more socialist countries in any way show that removing the socialist controls we have now would not improve our economy even more?",1203698555

121354,comment,121137,121324,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"The examples are numerous - please look around.  Simple examples would include the rent control policies in New York and San Francisco.  The intention: provide low cost rent for tenants at the expense of landlords.  The reality: because of the rent control, the ROI for entering the rental business declined dramatically.  This caused less development of rental units and rapidly increasing rents for the scarcer supply left.  The result of rent control: chronically higher rents for all but those lucky enough to already be renting and a chronic under-supply of rental units.  Other classic examples are the minimum wage which increases unemployment, medicare/Medicaid which drives up the cost of health care for all, excessive taxation to pay for all of the entitlements which is a disincentive to business, etc.",1203697228

Take a break.<p>2. and 3.  Most of the time I want to stop, it is not time to change.  A perfect analogy for me is I was working on a really difficult puzzle (yes, a real puzzle), and with about 100 pieces remaining I would have swore with a 99% certainty factor that a bunch of pieces were missing.  I was so close to finishing, but I started to think a handful of pieces were missing so I almost quit.  It turns out, one piece was missing and that is what planted the seed of a bunch of pieces missing, and the other pieces were just difficult.  So for me personally that last push to finish and stay motivated and not quit is very difficult.<p>Different people deal with things differently, but that puzzle analogy relates to a lot of things in my life.  I almost quit right before I am about to make a breakthrough, and forcing myself to struggle and churn is quite difficult but necessary.<p>Often having someone else help me get through that part is useful, for example just working on something with someone else will give me a reason to finish.  Sometimes they can even help do that finishing part - some of my best working partners are great at polishing and tweaking right at the end, since thats what I lack.<p>Just wait until I release my next app, I am sure this will be reflected in it.",1203696622

Teaching to program is even harder.</i><p>The only programming class I ever took was taught by an unmotivated teacher who only taught programming because he needed the money. That was in high school. I started out excited about the amazing power programming gave me to bend the computer to my will and make it do cool things, but the teacher's lack of enthusiasm covered the class like a dismal fog, and his intensely boring lectures and make-work assignments totally dampened my enthusiasm. I finally dropped the class.<p>I didn't go back to programming until years later when I was taking grad school in an entirely different subject and I rediscovered programming on my own. I taught myself C and ended up spending all night coding and debugging and loving it, to the point where I neglected the actual subject I was supposed to be learning.<p>While I've never taught programming to others, I spent several years teaching technical classes to engineers in the semiconductor industry. I  also taught English as a second language for five years. From these experiences, I've learned the following:<p>Learning to program is really fun. Because programming is really fun.<p>Teaching any subject is fun if you enjoy the subject matter, have a passion for teaching, and if you teach people who want to learn and have aptitude in the field.<p>So if teaching programming is hard (instead challenging, but fun) it could mean you either don't enjoy programming, you don't have passion or aptitude for teaching, or you need to find motivated students with an aptitude for programming.<p>If the problem is that you don't enjoy programming, you need to find a different subject to teach.<p>If you don't have passion or aptitude for teaching, you need to get out of teaching as soon as possible, because you are likely ruining your students' first experiences with the subject matter.<p>And if your students appear unmotivated or lack aptitude, you should consider deeply the possibility that this could be because you have one of the two issues above, and repeat until the problem is resolved, or until you are really, really, really sure the problem isn't you.<p>If you are absolutely sure the problem isn't you, then you need to consider finding a teaching situation where students <i>are</i> motivated, and you need to discover methods to gently encourage those who genuinely lack programming aptitude to focus their learning in areas where they do have aptitude.<p>But before doing that, maybe it would be good to take one more round of considering if maybe the problem isn't you.",1364582243

Inflation is the expansion of the monetary base. Printing dollars, for example, is inflation. The increase in prices is a result of inflation, and there are numerous effects other than prices going up.<p>It's critical in economics to separate supply & demand of goods causing increases or decreases in prices, from monetary changes. Free market forces are not the same as central bank forces.<p>There's about 200 years of modern economic evidence for how exactly inflation works and how central banks create it.<p>I'll ignore the fact that the Fed has openly admitted it has devalued the dollar by 97% since its founding. I'll also ignore the fact that Bernanke recently said it was the goal of the Fed to generate asset inflation via QE aka debasing the dollar (see real estate skyrocketing 10% again, or 22% in Phoenix (a disaster market recently), see stocks at all time highs again ala 2007).<p>I'll also ignore the fact that Greenspan openly admitted the Fed has the direct ability to increase or decrease inflation, and can cause bubbles or pop them. He of all people should know.<p>It's not an assertion, it's a fact supported by extreme amounts of data.<p>If you increase the monetary base and money supply by hundreds of percent over a relatively short period of time, you're going to see a substantial increase in the price of goods in the currency in question.<p>If you 'print' dollars to buy trillions in mortgages and remove them from the market, you're going to limit supply of housing and cause approximately $3 to $4 trillion worth of inflation in just one year (what's happening right now). Not to mention simultaneously holding down mortgage rates via the government dominated mortgage market, by holding short term and long term interest rates artificially low by buying the paper that influences that. Then when consumers sell their homes, or take home equity loans, and then spend in any manner or buy anything else or loan their money to banks - the inflation gets discharged directly into the economy. This is one simple example, there are countless.<p>If today you have one trillion dollars, and tomorrow the Fed prints another trillion dollars, it's obvious what happens.<p>So not only do I have vast empirical economic proof not only do I have historical evidence for how it all works, not only do I have obvious math theory that is as simple as addition and subtraction, but I have the Fed openly admitting the scale of the inflation it has caused.<p>How many proof articles would you like on the topic?",1364580807

5462075,comment,5461178,5461988,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"Indeed - the last part about performance is the complete opposite of typical code beauty - it's why I listed it separately yet still called it very important when considering code beauty. I disagree that it is bad advice - I have seen code that matches the first 6 standard points yet was bad code because it performed terribly. Simply making pretty and understandable code is not good enough if it's actively harming the users of the system.<p>The key issue here is that you can have code that does perform within an order of magnitude that still fully follows the first 6 points. I'd argue that this code is inherently more beautiful than code that completely throws performance out the window - it is grounded in the reality of the physical universe.<p>For example, pretty code that loops through a large array multiple times when it could be changed to loop only once is, in my opinion, fairly 'ugly'. It's throwing out the user's experience (he might have to wait 0.1 of a second more on that button press - annoying!) for slightly easier to read code.<p>Obviously this is a line in the sand and you could argue either way, but whenever discussing code beauty I always bring up performance as they are often two sides to a coin and both are important. I agree with you that throwing out code beauty and optimizing everything is very bad - but you need a balance here. 'We will fix it later when performance becomes a problem' nearly always ends up as 'We will rewrite the performance critical parts of the code - customers are complaining!' - and now all of your pretty code is lost.<p>EDIT: Slow performance is also one of the prime indicators of code quality that a user can see. If code performs poorly, a user is likely to perceive that code as being badly written (and I think he is correct). Perception is reality, and when that user is deciding between two systems, he will be biased towards the faster one as he now believes that system to be of higher quality (even though the code on that system is a buggy mess that he just hasn't tripped yet).",1364580553

There are gradients of freedom that can be climbed; so Stallman will defend the use of non-GPL or proprietary software in situations where there are no other options, and said use gets more people to use free software.

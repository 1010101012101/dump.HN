4954968,comment,4954170,4954847,7,0,cube13,,,">x86 has had to be fast because most of the applications you will run on a daily basis are likely not really optimized, profiled or threaded anything above a couple compiler switches. They have to be fast because the code is so slow. Now with Android and IOS the language, libraries and sand-boxing improves the underlying mechanisms to the degree that most of the code that matters is optimized by Apple and Google where the equivalent Microsoft Windows libraries are not as optimized and in many cases so specialized that it gives a look and feel of a Wordpad type app rather than what you are really after.<p>This is so wrong, I actually don't know where to begin.<p>1.  It's true that most code isn't optimized for x86.  But most code isn't optimized, period.  Optimization is freaking hard.  Android and iOS aren't necessarily better optimized than Windows.  And Linux, especially RHEL, is screaming fast on the new Intel chips.  Windows isn't <i>that</i> terrible, either.<p>2.  Sandboxing actually hurts performance, because it requires an additional layer between the OS and userland to make sure that the code the user is executing is correct.<p>3.  None of this actually matters for chip architecture, since #1 is true of code in general, and #2 doesn't have any special architecture-based support.<p>4.  x86 isn't just Windows.  It's Linux, too.",1356130575

But unlike the candle example all of the light will be going roughly one direction. Think 'keychain LED flashlight' kind of light.<p>So in a place that literally has no light, it will be helpful. That last door in the dungeon, your village storage hut 30 miles from the nearest town on moonless nights. If you don't mind running the generator faster you can get brighter light for less time.<p>I took apart one of these [1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/FR160B-Microlink-Self-Powered-Weather-Flashlight/dp/B001QTXKB0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/FR160B-Microlink-Self-Powered-Weather-...</a> which is Grundig crank powered radio/siren/flashlight. Its pretty bright, and you can power the LED off the internal generator directly. In fact if you were handy with some shop tools you could probably build your own version of this light with just this radio thing and mechanical connection between the crank and the weight. (You would leave the flashlight set to 'on') You wouldn't get 30 minutes of light, more like 2 minutes. But conceptually the idea is the same.<p>I like the design ethos of the 'clock' style energy source (I've got a grandfather clock that you wind by pulling up the weights on it).<p>I expect in a nominally lit urban environment it will provide little benefit.

Really complex engineer tasks require your brain to slowly process the ideas that you have, sleep on them, discuss them with colleagues, maybe read something online about it. But I find that the argument that says 'you suck because you are too distracted' is kind of dangerous. Taken to the extreme and it becomes: 'oh I won't answer my mom because that makes me worse at my job' or 'oh I am not drinking wine tonight because I won't be at my best tomorrow'.

Look at the Kindle Fire - it had the advantage of being a tablet (where Android apps are still being developed), coming out quite a while back (again, app situation more favorable than now), having an existing content ecosystem (which Samsung doesn't), and being their first foray into the hardware/Android market (not the case for Samsung).<p>At this point, Samsung really doesn't have any choice but to stick to just skinning Android if it wants to keep selling phones.",1356129894

Stores have been known to instruct cashiers to enter information about customers during the checkout process -- age, gender, race, etc. -- and combined with what you buy, there is probably enough information to identify you or to distinguish you from the set of all shoppers.  Some stores print coupons with your receipt; it is not all that unlikely that the profile they are building of you as a customer, even without the use of a customer loyalty card, is used in deciding which coupons to print.<p>In the future, they might even use their security cameras to add some extra data points.  Never mind facial recognition; I bet they would only need to track your walking pattern as you move through the store.  Some people like to browse.  Some people enter knowing exactly what they are looking for.  Some people store by going left, others by going right.  Maybe the first thing you do is go to the produce section.<p>Chances are that this sort of data, combined with other data, can be used to identify you even if you never explicitly gave Walmart any identifying information.

And then you wake up at some point and find that you're 100% dependent on AWS.<p>By that point, if you're lucky your monthly AWS bill gets you an invite to speak at the next AWS conference. :-) You might even get a personal customer support rep that calls you when your servers go down.<p>A website/service cannot by definition be HA if it's reliant on one service or infrastructure provider. AWS has so many proprietary parts now that you really need to be careful which ones to use so that you don't wake up one day and realize that you're completely dependent on AWS.<p>I'd stay away from this with a 30-foot pole, but if we really did need to use it, I would only use the features that I felt comfortable building internally at some future point if we chose to move off of AWS.<p>It's important to keep your software stack as flexible and open as possible, and for risk-management you should plan on using (or least having the option of using) multiple vendors and service providers.",1356128843

4954847,comment,4954170,4954312,2,0,Nikker,,,"I completely agree with performance per watt Intel is on the path to be where they need to be but ARM is on path to be par with a chip that even AMD's x86 offerings can't touch on a core by core basis.  Now with Microsoft's Windows 8 trying it's very best to be a tablet experience it seems by sales figures people much rather prefer an Android or Apple tablet compared to even i5/A10 laptops with Windows 8.  The technicalities you present are right on the money but what we have here is a perfect storm.  Microsoft wants to be a tablet OS manufacturer and is skirting the traditional desktop/laptop experience leaving Intel with no real face value to their contribution.<p>When people go to their local stores and see rows of tablets that look like tablets and rows of laptops that look like tablets and rows of desktops that look like tablets, well they just seem to get actual tablets.  Sure an Intel i3 will handily beat out the upper echelon of ARM offerings but with Android and IOS be entirely optimized for this experience we are finally realizing what AMD fans have been shouting for decades, the extra horsepower really does not come into effect often enough to make it a deal breaker.  Your web page may load 40% slower on an ARM rig but when the Intel model will load it in 1.5s and you tablet will load it in 2s we now experience the Law of Diminishing Returns.  If a dual core ARM A15 can consistently run at around 40-50% of the speed of an i3 mobile processor, a quad core ARM should settle at around 60-75% while being tasked to do much, much less.<p>With Intel and ARM you are also dealing with 2 <i>very</i> different ecosystems.  x86 has had to be fast because most of the applications you will run on a daily basis are likely not really optimized, profiled or threaded anything above a couple compiler switches.  They have to be fast because the code is so slow.  Now with Android and IOS the language, libraries and sand-boxing improves the underlying mechanisms to the degree that most of the code that matters is optimized by Apple and Google where the equivalent Microsoft Windows libraries are not as optimized and in many cases so specialized that it gives a look and feel of a Wordpad type app rather than what you are really after.<p>Basically I feel by looking strictly at Intel's raw performance as to the reason why a platform will succeed is improper and an unfair comparison.  People are moving en-mass to tablet and smart phone ecosystems not because they are faster or run by a particular processor but because it feels like a custom solution and the integration overall is acceptable.  So I don't think it is ARM v Intel but rather tablet v notebook and laptop.  If Microsoft keeps up with making their desktop OS look and feel like a tablet OS people buy tablets and Windows 8 doesn't have the applications, word of mouth or market penetration to make that possible right now.<p>If things don't change and quick we may just have a Microsoft and Intel ""Double clutch""<p>""Double clutch: this is where a non-swimmer ends up in deep water and, out of panic, grabs the closest person to them to stay afloat.""

We propose that this ingredient is an implicit use of the Bayesian probability theory. Furthermore, we argue that both classical and quantum computation are special cases of probability reasoning. On these grounds, introducing Bayesian probability theory in classical computation as well, we reduce a typical NP problem, namely 3-SAT, to a linear programming problem. According to algorithmic complexity theory, this proves that P=NP.""<p>""Any logical algorithm can be formulated as a linear programming problem. Specially, a basic question of logical satisability with n variables, namely 3-SAT, is equivalent to a linear programming problem with O(n^3) unknowns and even in general with O(n) unknowns. According to algorithmic complexity theory, this proves that P=NP.""<p>""Again, the main reasons of the supposedly quantum eciency are basically unknown,
but the common wisdom is that entanglement should be the key ingredient. Indeed, in the
quantum community, it is widely believed that classical systems cannot simulate highly
entangled quantum systems [13]. By contrast, we have nevertheless argued [14] that
the concept of entanglement is actually a quite classical attribute of contextual systems.
Furthermore, any classical computer can be regarded as a highly entangled system as far
as the entanglement is measured between the binary digits of the processed data during
the computation. In addition, we shall argue that the crucial ingredient is not in the least
a Hilbert space with its full quantum machinery but only a exible randomization, or to
be exact, the implicit use of Bayes probabilities. This is like a grin without a cat in Alice
and Bob adventures in Quantum Land.""<p>They devote two pages to history and what should be common knowledge to anyone interested in this paper.<p>The actual proof is mathametical gibberish, however there are surprisingly large contiguous sections of the proof that, by themselves, work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6658v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6658v2.pdf</a>",1356128185

4954771,comment,4953293,4954431,10,0,mbrubeck,,,"[Disclaimer: I've written only a tiny amount of Rust code, and no real Go code.  I work for Mozilla but not on the Rust team.]<p>From what I've seen Go is designed with emphasis on ease of programming, performance, and concurrency; Rust is designed with emphasis on safety, performance, and concurrency.  (Of course these are broad generalizations, and neither language is limited to only these concerns.)<p>Go is a simpler language in various ways.  Rust provides more control over things like memory management but at the cost of some added complexity (e.g. multiple pointer types).  Rust provides some abstraction/expressivity features that Go lacks (like parametric/generic types, macros, and algebraic datatypes), again at the cost of some added complexity.  Rust makes more static safety guarantees (for example, no null or ""nil"" pointers).  While the compiler provides many of these guarantees without creating extra work for the programmer, sometimes you do have to structure or annotate your code in a particular way so the compiler can prove its safety.<p>Of course the two languages are also similar in many ways.  For example their syntaxes are in the C family; they compile to native code; they provide CSP-style concurrency; they have some amount of local type inference; and they do not use inheritance as the main style of composition.<p>Rust's safety features should make it ideal for writing security- or stability-critical code.  Go's simplicity probably makes it faster to learn and better for rapid development, especially for programmers used to dynamic languages like Python or JavaScript.  Rust's expressive power might provide more options for abstracting common patterns out of large codebases, or to provide libraries that extend the language in different ways (e.g. using macros).  Go is more mature than Rust at the moment and has more libraries and a larger community.  Rust has first-class support for code that does not use garbage collection, which can make it more suitable for certain types of systems programming.",1356127715

They were fantastic to work with, and successfully convinced me on why I should try publishing through them rather than trying to e.g. go through a traditional publisher or even one of the smarter tech-specific presses.<p>I've been asked to write a book for a few years by potential readers, and a few times by potential publishers, but I was very disinterested in doing so.  For most people capable of writing tech books, writing books is a very poor use of time under any economic calculus.  The typical model is that you and the publisher agree to do the book, then you're paid an advance (sometimes in installments contingent on milestones).  You earn a royalty on each sale of the book, with the royalties first going to pay back (""earn out"") the advance, and then being paid to you quarterly.<p>This sounds reasonable, until you hear the numbers (typical advance for a tech book from a first time author: $5k, typical royalty percentage: 8% on a physical copy, 15% on an ebook).  They're not universally that bad -- an author or two from Apress and Pragmatic Programmer wrote me to say they were genuinely happy with their experiences -- but that's sort of the general flavor of things.<p>If you do the math, it is highly unlikely your book will recoup the advance, and that is indeed what happens to most tech books.  So you've traded months of full-time labor writing and rewriting, plus additional months of part-time work hawking the book to anyone who will listen, in return for $5k.  That is not a rational use of time for anybody who can e.g. do contract programming, which (one would assume) virtually all tech book writers could do.<p>When I said as much to publishers who asked me to write things, they said ""Ahh, but the book will allow you to establish your bona fides"", and I do not believe that making stupid decisions for my business successfully demonstrates to clients that I will make smart decisions for theirs.  To my view of things, I'd rather have lots of folks be able to read my writing than have it blessed by a gatekeeper but widely unavailable.<p>But blog posts do leave a lot to be desired for teaching people.  For one, my blog is very disorganized, since I have six years of back-issues which appear in order of ""what I was working on that week"", and they're of varying quality and relevance, particularly early in my career.  Something with a bit of structure and curation seemed like it would add value.  Plus, I am spelling- and design-challenged, so having an editor and someone with a sense of style would be a plus.<p>That's basically what Hyperink pitched: curating the best of the blog into a book, complete with editing and design help, with some extra essays added.  It's far less work than scratch-writing a book, the terms are more equitable (no advance, equitable royalty split), and it provides incremental value to readers over the blog.<p>I don't expect to make a huge amount of money on it, relative to the business in general, but the idea sounded attractive enough to try it as an experiment.",1356127651

But holy shit, what a piece of crap. I'm really wondering what all the gushing reviewers were smoking. Also, what the hell is wrong with that awful display? Why is white so green?)",1356127318

Then I bookmark it but never return.<p>I'm hoping that this is kinda like a ""Best of Patio11"", giving busy people like me a chance to have it all in one place on my hard disk. If so, $9.99 is a bargain.<p>Downloaded, up to Page 14 of 136. I guess dinner will be late tonight.",1356127300

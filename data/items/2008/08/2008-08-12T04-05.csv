In my own pov, science is not only inherently related to technology, but also it's a common interest of everyone I know that works on high tech. Not so sure about general tech and web startups though.",1218516695

What I think is: 1) interesting enough science articles go to the front page when they are posted on the news queue, 2) there are people interested in science here, maybe they'll care to start posting science related links again? I don't know, it's just an idea.<p>I post my own articles when I have time too.",1218516251

Historically, communities evolve independently of the vision their founders had when seeding them.<p>So, you can't complain why there are less science related posts. It is just the way because the community does not find science interesting. (By the way, I personally love science).

And usually its something very simple too.<p>And once again you approach this as a hacker. Put yourself in the shoes of a complete noob. Lets say 2 years later he was able to copy paste together some working code to get his basic idea working(it has to be basic, because the person doesn't have the skills/resources to do anything groundbreaking). Then its time to add a new feature. Once again he needs to dive into the code, and it'll take him a lot longer to finish, compared to even a contracted agency that can just jump into the source safe and copy paste the specific code for that specific function.<p>If you are a hacker, doing it yourself is definitely advisable. But for your average Joe Blow who has no clue how to code something as basic as a hello world app, I'd think its much more advisable to have someone else do it, instead of wasting time putting together crappy code, they can be up and running with a decent quality website much faster. And then while the new changes get coded they can continue working on marketing their site. You can have the best site on the net, but w/o users its worthless.",1218514524

The data rate is slow (200k if you're lucky, usually much lower than that), but it lets you use the DUN bluetooth profile when connected with OSX, so it's an acceptable wireless modem, and a decent phone.  The DUN profile only seems to work with my powerbook though; I've tried using the phone as a bluetooth modem with my nokia 770, and the blackberry won't advertise that profile in that situation.  I don't understand how that works, but it's a limitation to be aware of.<p>I'm personally holding out for an Android device, mostly because the pearl thing in the blackberry gets crap in it and then you can't really use the UI until you manage to work the dust particles out.<p>Also, what is this excellent data plan you're speaking of?  Is it just the $40/month unlimited internet plan on their 2G network, or is there an actual 3G data plan somewhere that I haven't been able to find?",1218513739

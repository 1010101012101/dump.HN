4211350,comment,4210208,4210208,1,0,vorg,,,"The easiest initial way to live on Mars is not to terraform, but to build huge insulated cities, perhaps by remote-controlled robot years before we first get there. Terraforming could come much later by those who already live there. Earth might need insulated cities in the future, if the air is polluted enough, so perhaps that'd be a premiminary learning exercise in how to build them. Of course, Mars is anywhere from 4 to 20 light-minutes away, so the robots would at least need to be semi-intelligent, so prior experience building colonies on the Moon, only a few light seconds away, would help. And the Moon would be just as hospitable as Mars anyway, if we're building insulated cities. Rebuilding by robot in a radiated nuclear wasteland on Earth might even be a learning exercise for building on the Moon.<p>As for the low gravity in each place, wouldn't children born there adapt as they grow up, with a bit of medical help of course. Although their parents could move from a higher gravity environment to a lower easily enough, I wouldn't imagine anyone could move from the environment they grew up in to a higher-gravity one, so anyone born on the Moon or Mars would be doomed to live there forever I'd imagine.",1341658425

However, I find that most contemporary real-world ML applications (from face recognition to collaborative filtering to computer vision) do use algorithms that ""learn from data"", using some kind of learning technique, i.e. supervised, unsupervised or a combination of those.<p>The process of creating that kind of algorithm is also very different: it is based heavily on mathematical/statistical/probabilistic methods and hence the resulting algorithm can be proven that it works with some kind of certainty. On contrary, creating an EA is mostly some kind of ""art"" (as one UCL professor put it).<p>All in all, I can't help but feel that even though they are both approaches to the same problem (""how can a computer program learn?""), data-driven methods and EA algorithms don't share much more. And since the results produced by the former are what most people expect of an ML algorithm to accomplish, I tend to think of those when using the phrase ""machine learning"".<p>But it's all about semantics in the end.<p>// I noticed that you are an ML PhD student.

4211322,comment,4209384,4209384,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"The number one issue with Firefox is the fact the developers who make the changes and the people who tell the developers to make the changes do not listen. It's the same issue with the Wordpress development team as well, both open source projects being led in the wrong direction ignoring absolutely everything the community asks for.<p>Firefox used to be completely about open source in the sense of the meaning; change what users want changed, add in features the users want added in, but then Firefox got popular and didn't have to try as hard to impress people any more and the downward spiral continued.<p>I'm one of those people that switched to Chrome. I only switched about 6 months ago because I had hope that Firefox would come to their senses and fix their damn browser, but it never happened. Chrome has it down-pat in terms of backwards compatibility for plugins and themes and no memory issues.<p>The number one complaint I had with Firefox is the plugins I needed to do my job and keep myself entertained were being blamed for the memory issues of Firefox when it has been a known problem in Firefox for sometime. Every few releases the Mozilla team touts new memory optimisation fixes that will make the browser more stable, but the browser still feels clunky and buggy.<p>Fair enough the developers of Firefox addons should be doing their part in terms of proper memory management (releasing memory when not needed, etc) but seriously addons are Javascript, HTML and CSS mostly and Mozilla should have worked out a way to effectively auto manage memory even for really bad plugins. I know the Aurora channel supposedly has a fix for the bad plugin behaviour issues, but the whole poor addon memory management issue has been an issue with Firefox since the really early days (around version 1.5 I believe). For years Mozilla denied any memory issues with the browser, it wasn't until a little while ago when the market share started dropping of Firefox that they started feigning interest in the memory management issues.",1341657405
4211321,comment,4209384,4209384,2,0,josteink,,,"As someone who converted from Firefox to Chrome, I think this mostly sums it up pretty well. Especially the part about being community-driven and then not listening to the community.<p>I see others have also mentioned memory-usage and that is also a fair point. At some point, Firefox would have memory leaks so huge that it spent most of its CPU time constantly trying to GC, slowing to a complete halt.<p>And then, just like with the updates, you had to restart. Restarting Firefox was a pain. But somehow restarting Chrome when updates come along is not. Why is that?<p>My desktop is a quad-core system with hyper-threading. That's 8 logical cores for the machine if utilized correctly. By Chrome having a process-per-tab model and Firefox not, everything else being the same Chrome can reduce its startup times to 12.5% of that of Firefox. It's an order of magnitude improvement.<p>You don't care about restarting Chrome because it just takes one second and you are back where you started. Firefox takes almost 10. That's way beyond annoying your users.<p>When you are the browser spending ages doing a restart, you're not in a position to force updates on your users.<p>Another thing which I haven't seen mentioned anywhere, which has been broken in Firefox since the very first releases is the add-on and add-on compatibility checking. It's retarded and I cannot believe it hasn't been fixed yet.<p>The typical Firefox update process goes like this: 1. Firefox informs you there is an update and you need to restart. 2. You accept a restart 3. Firefox shuts down, updates, and restarts. 4. upon restart <i>after the update has been installed</i>, it checks if your addons are compatible. WTF?!?<p>Usually that works out fine, but every now and then it doesn't. And then it's too late. That's retarded.<p>Why on earth would you check compatibility when it is already too late to do something about it? The process should be re-ordered. Compatibility checking should be done <i>first</i>. Then Firefox could say ""There is an update and all your add-ons are compatible. Would you like to update now?"".<p>A simple re-ordering of things it already does would have solved one of the two biggest issues people have with the update-mechanism. Why hasn't this been done already?<p>I'm a Chrome convert now, but I keep coming back to Firefox to see if things have improved, because I really believe in what Firefox stands for and what it represents. Unfortunately, I keep coming back to Chrome because for me, it just feels like a better browser.",1341657334

Which is important when you're a two man company and all of a sudden you've discovered you need to process $100k of credit card transactions from yesterday, and you better get started on it because there's already another $300k in transactions generated today.  It's only one script, so there's no need for revision control.  Damn, there's only one guy working on it, it can run out of his home directory.  And of course, it was so successful, successfully a blackbox, he's asked to automate some other task, which is only related because there's some slight dependency, and, well, it's a dependency, so let's just put it in the same script we already run.  Rinse, repeat.<p>Were these scripts terrible? Of course.  But they were the work horses of the Internet and any company with two CPUs to rub together in the 90s.  There's a reason that ""perl is the duct tape of the Internet"" was a saying in the mid- to late- 90s: because it was.<p>These scripts work perfectly fine if the person who wrote them and fully understand them runs them, yet inexplicably fall apart when someone who didn't write them run them (similar to [0]).  These scripts can smell the fear of the new guy put in charge to maintain them.  This is where heisenbugs roost and schroedinbugs become the stuff nightmares are made of, despite that they had most likely been running without issue for months or years since the guy who wrote them left.<p>[0] ""Tom Knight and the Lisp Machine"" <a href=""http://catb.org/jargon/html/koans.html#id3141171"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/jargon/html/koans.html#id3141171</a>",1341656497

4211259,comment,4210635,4210635,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The problem with mobs is that within a mob a lot of subtlety is lost. So when weighing the relative advantages of one thing which has diffuse, gradual, hard-to-define benefits versus another thing which has concrete, blatant, and immediate benefits the mob will almost invariably pick the second one. And this is a big problem for companies because as a company gets larger and larger it stops being a single group of friends or acquaintances and becomes, essentially, a mob.<p>Elements of healthy corporate culture such as trust are easily traded off by the mob for the seemingly superior ""accountability"" of micro-management, for example.<p>And you see the same patterns in everything at a big company. Ever notice how internal tools in a big company are typically of very shoddy quality? That's because the pain of poor tooling is diffuse and spread out over time while the effort required to create better tools would be immediate and concrete (representing some opportunity cost to develop some shipped feature or such-like). And the same calculus applies to refactoring and re-engineering efforts.<p>The same dynamics play out in society as large as well. It can be difficult to stand up and fight for individual rights such as freedom of speech or the right to own firearms in the face of strong, highly focused criticism. And if such rights hadn't been enshrined in the US constitution they would be that much harder to retain. Drug use being a perfect example. It can be a serious uphill battle to argue for the right to, say, use heroin and that such a right will lead to a better society.

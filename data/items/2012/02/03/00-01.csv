3545262,comment,3542415,3542956,2,0,ekianjo,,,"Nope, Iwas not arguing about my own previous point. In the first one, I replied to the idea that Carrefour is overcharging for food, and that then nothing prevents producers from selling their own products at a cheaper price. They can start small and setup their own distribution.<p>My second point was to reply to another idea floating around, that ""if a new competitor enters the market, Carrefour will slash their prices to kill them off"". Then, the small producer has the choice to differentiate if they cannot fight on price.<p>By the way, since I'm French, I may as well remind you that in every small town and big city of France, there are still weekly markets where local producers come and sell their products, very often for a higher (and not just a little higher) price than what you would pay in Carrefour or other supermarkets. And guess what ? Some people STILL buy their food there. Not everyone, but quite a lot do. So, there's nothing preposterous about the idea I was proposing, because there's clear precedent, even in the current market situation. Some people will always be paying to pay more for ""quality"", ""traceability"" and direct-relationship of trust between the buyer and the seller.<p>Now, for most people (not the ones I just mentioned), you also have to realise that Food has become a commodity, and therefore for those people, they are not going to be interested in paying more, they simply want to get their food as cheap as they can, so they can spend their money somewhere else (ipad, new tv, vacations, etc...).<p>It's all about knowing your consumers in the end, and finding out how you can better serve (some of) them.<p>Coming back to the discussion, the competitors of Google Maps should be thinking of how they can provide more value to users than the ""free"" Google Maps. By the way, in other markets, like video games, some online services like Steam have no problem fighting against free offers (i.e. piracy) just because they provide more convenience to the end users.  They get it, and they don't bitch about piracy or whoever else killing their business.<p>When you start pointing fingers around, it's usually your product/offer/service is simply not good enough, or nobody cares about it.",1328230257

3545237,comment,3545008,3545125,4,0,genbattle,,,"Yea he mentions language features like interface-based polymophism, garbage collection, namespaces, first class functions, closures, etc. But then he goes on to talk about I/O methods, string manipulation, CSV output, etc. By which I think he means standard library features. The post really should have been split into language features + standard library features to make it clearer.<p>I may be influenced by the fact i'm into Go at the moment, but i think it covers most of the ""features"" he talks about, as well as many of the ""libraries"" (some may not be part of the standard library, but will be available through 3rd party packages). If the author is reading this, I encourage him to have a good honest look at <a href=""http://golang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/</a><p>I don't know if i like his discussion of ""math-oriented types"" vs. ""machine-oriented types"". At least as far as I see it (and according to wikipedia[1]), in maths whole integers (Z) are a subset of rational numbers (Q). When in your high-school maths class you say 3 + 2.5 = 5.5, you're really doing an implicit conversion to 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5 or 3/1 + 5/2 = 11/2. Most languages allow you to also get rid of the bit-size of numbers by just defining ""int"" or ""float"" numbers that default to some predetermined bit-width (e.g. 32-bit). Most languages also have libraries or mechanisms (see Go and Python) for large precision numerical calculation so you can have your theoretically infinite size ""no-overflow"" situation; but that comes at the cost of speed, so we only use these types when it is specifically needed. It's not impossible to use them in all cases, but it is impractical.<p>In the end, a language can't do everything. Most languages focus on providing a good core, along with mechanism for users to extend functionality in any way they see fit. In this case I think the author wants the language to just do everything for him out of the box, without any pesky libraries, and without being bloated or slow. _That_ most certainly _is_ impossible. There is a good reason why no language implements _all_ of these ""features"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)</a><p>Ed: Z is a subset of Q.",1328229296

For example, there was a massive outflow of funds from Equities after the most recent correction (as there usually is when the market performs badly), and those people who pulled out of equities did not get to participate in the record-setting rebound that happened soon after.<p>Comparing performance over any given time period to some arbitrary standard (in this case, ""flat"" is assumed to be bad) doesn't tell the whole picture. On the flip side, there are many instances where funds performed admirably but in a time when the markets as a whole did even better. Just as I wouldn't commend a fund for gains in a bull market, docking a fund or portfolio for being ""flat"" when the market as a whole was flat over the given time period is unfair.<p>I don't doubt that your company has outperformed (after all, you have the data and I don't). But for what it's worth, was it a slam dunk to assume 40 years ago that your company would have outperformed over the subsequent 40 years? That's the problem: picking winners before they're winners.

They seem like the results of deep and unknown mechanisms that I unfortunately have no control on. The best I can do is know myself better and manage that. For example, stress is an issue, and the only way I seem to be able to decrease my stress is to <i>avoid</i> stressful situations (for example avoiding too much work/responsibilities), instead of being able to <i>deal</i> with them.

And you make it look just like that with adjusting the comparison in favor of vi, the screwdriver. This is just wrong. Let's see, you could also say:<p>Screwdriver: specific to only one type of screw, limited to only a couple of similar sizes and all you can do is drive screws in and out or maybe stab someone.<p>Assembly line: way more complex and needs some setup time but you can do WAY more things with it, way faster, way more efficient once setup, especially on a larger scale. It can drive screws in and out, solder, cut, fold, package etcetcetcetc. Pretty much anything you set it up to.<p>So, vi is a horrible replacement or alternative to use in the typical huge Java (or what have you) e.g. web app projects where things like auto completion and easily getting from one class to another, built-in compiling, debugging, refactoring, source control etcetcetcetc really start to make your life easier. vi on its own cannot offer you that, not even remotely... then you need a shell and other programs to do all that. And there are no alternatives to most of the tasks an IDE can offer you help with.<p>vi is definitely nice for editing files especially on a slow line and as a general purpose editor - but it is no replacement for an IDE and the comparison that it is ""better than an IDE"" might only apply for exactly one task: editing files.

What is more, the number of people who have been burned by having something 'in the cloud' from a smallish supplier is growing. So having private designs that would be 'gone' if your servers were offline would be an issue. And lastly the biggest thing most people pay for these days is simulation anyway, and that is something easily charged for. You might consider 'free schematics' private or public, but $20 to generate a PCB from one. You could work out a scheme where if I publish a schematic using upverter and someone comes along they can 'buy' a PCB for it and you split the revenue share with the schematic creator. You can work a partnership with one of the PCB houses so that it 'just works' or you can send them a zip file of the various bits (gerbers, drill file, tool file, etc).<p>Something you might offer for 'free' would be something like Google's ChartServer API but 'schematic server' API.

I'm not saying it can't be helpful (it probably is), but doubt it's a cure.<p>Now, generally speaking, for those of us that are well educated, entirely employable and rather wealthy in monetary terms and generally freedom, then achieving success seems to be up to us. I'd contend that happiness is most easily manifested in societally recognized success (thus, hard work + luck). In other words i'd contend happiness is easily derived for 'being respected'.<p>If not achieved through work and good fortune, i'd say happiness can still be achieved with constant vigilance against some shitty cultural norms we hold as a society. Frankly, the illusion of control is astounding in wealthy countries, and so is constant marketing, that buying shit will make you happy or attractive, or that some product will give you some idealized life that is paraded in front of you every day on television (or the internet). I'd contend that many people are affected by these fake, shitty messages.<p>Is it perfectly admirable to try and try and try and fail consistently throughout your life? Absolutely. Why should we look to the successful for advice on happiness? Probably the last place to look, survivorship bias will ruin any results. We can't all be popular published authors or start apple computers. I'm a Dvorak typist (*ducks), so i like to reference August Dvorak on the subject of failure. This guy dedicated his life to improving society, for both regular typists and notably, amputees, yet was stymied at every turn by something as simple as a coordination problem. I think it would be very difficult for someone with a life like his to not be entirely jaded at such unprecedented failure, even when you know what you are doing makes sense.<p>Can you be jaded and happy? Well, maybe, this would cause a debate on what we mean by 'happiness', which is de facto the entire argument here. I would contend that it's difficult. Would ideas like Csikszentmihalyi's help? Probably, but i'd be very skeptical to look at them as actual solutions. Sometimes people fail, and it's okay to fail if you tried your best, and i don't mean that in the 'keep failing until you (obviously eventually) succeed' way. I mean really fail. Until that is mentally acceptable, which is really freaking hard to maintain in our society, then i think some people are going to be continuously frustrated and perpetually unhappy, and i don't think 'convince yourself to be happy' is an acceptable prescription. Again, while i think it will help, it's a rough world out there, and it's hard to maintain the mental composure suggested here in the face of real tragedy.",1328227424

A single node compute engine that can scale up may turn out to be the more economically attractive option.""</i><p>The unstated bias is what I might call 'conservation of compute' which is to say most of the work that has gone into partitioning such problems does so assuming that you want to find the answer in the fewest number of compute cycles because that will lead to the quickest result.<p>One of the things I got to witness at Google was the notion that you could relax the constraint on minimum number of cycles if those cycles could be run in parallel. This is done in a small scale in current micro-architectures where the processor speculatively continues computing past a branch on the 'bet' that the branch won't be taken, only to discard the results of that computation once it is known how the branch will go. This has shown to increase performance even if your branch prediction is only 50/50 because you avoid the pipeline stall when you're right.<p>My assertion is that the number of 'cores' and hence the number of compute engines you can apply to the problem, if you can decompose it into many speculative copies, will let you essentially compute many possible solutions in parallel and select the one you want through a 'fingerprint' of which branches would be or would not be taken. (the path through the graph as it were).<p>And this one:<p><i>""Not every company is Google/Facebook/Amazon -- with the attendant wealth of capital and human resources of these giants.""</i><p>This is true, but both Google and Amazon have been making their infrastructure available on a pay per use basis. I expect this to continue. Then you will get domain specific portals into that infrastructure in which a middle layer of semantics sits between you and the infrastructure. Sort of like WolframAlpha putting Mathematica between you and WA's server farm, or S3 putting a storage layer between you and Amazons hardware.<p>I too root for some of these problems to be solved at the OS/hardware level but from the perspective of a companies willingness to put their data on another company's gear, at some point if you're being toasted by a competitor who has made that choice then the choice gets effectively made for you.<p>I'd love to write code on the bare metal of an upscale ARM chip with a graphics processor but as anyone who has tried to do this on an OMAP or Broadcom ARM chip can tell you, that isn't going to happen until you design your own ARM chip with GPU and build it yourself. I see this as an example of the choice I would like to make being denied me by forces outside of my control.",1328227376

In addition to the features I now know I needed, I feel like I&#x27;ve gathered quite some experience on how to achieve control, reproducibility and flexibility using AsciiDoc but I didn&#x27;t have the chance to get it out of my head and written down :-) There are a few pitfalls with the asciidoc and dblatex chain which you only learn to navigate when you&#x27;re in the middle of writing the thesis (floating images, word count, bibliography, organization etc.). The framework/workflow I&#x27;ve set up considers most of them already and has been a huge timesaver and ease of mind for me. You can see some of the underlying ideas went into the Makefile I shared and you could recycle/use them to get a head start on your thesis/project. I&#x27;d definitely be happy to collaborate with you and share all my (MIT-licensed) experience :-) Feel free to shoot me an e-mail, I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll find me through a quick google inquiry [1] ;-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://lmgtfy.com/?q=lbnl+huck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=lbnl+huck</a>",1429311595

9397655,comment,9396116,9396116,0,0,dheera,,,"What I really want is a wrapper for sudo.\nWhenever I use sudo, if type the password correctly it works instantly; if I mistype the password, it delays for 2 seconds before asking again. Often it&#x27;s faster to Ctrl+C UP ENTER than to wait for that annoying 2 seconds. So it would be nice if a wrapper existed to see if sudo gives access within 0.1 seconds, and if it doesn&#x27;t, assume the password was wrong, kill the sudo process and launch the command again. Automate the Ctrl+C UP ENTER.",1429311535

When MongoDB was released, none of the drivers used the &quot;safer&quot; settings. 2.) 10gen, at the time, released benchmarks with the &quot;unsafe&quot; settings comparing it to MySQL and boasted that MongoDB was much faster (ignoring the fact that it wasn&#x27;t acknowledging your writes).",1429311525
9397653,comment,9396950,9397208,0,0,guygurari,,,"I recently wrote a simulation that involved some heavy numerical calculations. Without optimization it was dog slow and would have taken probably years to produce the results I needed. With compiler optimization it took a few days, which was good enough for me. Perhaps I could have improved on that with manual optimizations, but the speed was good enough so instead of spending time optimizing I did other things.<p>The implicit assumption in the talk (based on this summary) is that we always want the most optimized code. But in fact that is never the case -- what we really want is for the code to be fast enough (or be space-optimized enough). So the relevant question is this: in what percentage of cases do compiler optimizations take us from &#x27;not fast enough&#x27; to &#x27;fast enough&#x27;. In all these cases the compiler is useful, because it saves us the cost of doing our own optimizations. In my experience this percentage is far from negligible, so at least for me optimizing compilers are highly valuable.",1429311517

Assuming the latter, I disagree with several of his points. Here I want to bring one to the readers&#x27; attention and it&#x27;s to do with the economics of correctness proofs.<p>One of his key arguments was that compiler optimisations are difficult to prove correct, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons why optimising compilers will be replaced by a combination of simple compilers + assembly hand-written by domain experts. It is true that such proofs are (currently) expensive, but misses the point of the economics of correctness proofs: Correctness proofs are difficult,\n  but proving compilers correct amortises that cost over all\n  subsequent uses. In contrast, program specific correctness proofs are typically of comparable difficulty, but don&#x27;t amortise in this way. Therefore it seems to be cheaper in the long run, to focus on the correctness of optimising compilers. Moreover, as compilers and optimisations are quite a restricted  class of algorithms, hence it is more likely that we can  reuse (parts of) correctness proofs and  prover technology for compilers.",1429311342

Similarly, strongly typed and pure languages like Haskell give you even more.  You can do a lot with types, but on top of that Haskell allows you to define rewrite rules that tell the compiler how things can be optimized.

I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &#x27;[that] kind of compilation&#x27;, though, as you never specify what kind of compilation you mean.<p>Implementing a circuit on an FPGA involves many of the same, or similar, steps and processes as implementing it on an ASIC (and obviously, does not involve all the physical design stuff).

Consider Postgres, Firefox, or Photoshop for that matter: I expect the user-experience of these products to be significantly degraded when compiled with -O0.<p>The trouble with this analysis is that it assumes that a codebase is a static, finalizable goal: it will be written, it will be done, and then it is perfect. And that might be true of... oh, I don&#x27;t know... qmail. But the development of most software is an ongoing process, and the tradeoff between developer time and runtime will never go away: nobody in the video-game industry would consider for a second the idea that performance-critical code doesn&#x27;t need to make deadlines!

That sets off warning lights for some people, and for good reason.<p>I totally get that to experiment with a new protocol, you need real-world data. Definitely. So if say 1% or 5% of that communication were non-standard, I really wouldn&#x27;t have much of an issue. But when the &quot;experimentation&quot; is 50%, it&#x27;s on the verge of being the normal path; it doesn&#x27;t seem like experimentation. Perhaps they could continue the experiment and go from 50% to 60% or 80% - there isn&#x27;t much a difference at that point. In fact, if the new protocol is better, it would be almost irrational not to - if 50% is considered ok ethically, and moving to 60% saves costs, then why wouldn&#x27;t you?<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there is something wrong here. It&#x27;s not even seriously worrying, given Google&#x27;s positive track record on SPDY. Still, it&#x27;s very close to the edge of being worrying. That worry of course is that they expand beyond 50%, and are slow to standardize or never do so - in which case things would clearly be wrong. Again, Google has a good reputation here, given SPDY.

Likewise if I ask for a review and your only comment is &quot; file buffer is too small &quot; I&#x27;m gonna guess the rest is alright else you wouldn&#x27;t bother pointing out smaller things. If I&#x27;m unsure about something, I&#x27;ll ask about it explicitly.<p>Outside of a feedback system like a code review, it is important to let people know you appreciate their work. And it&#x27;s to my detriment that I don&#x27;t let people know, honestly, when I appreciate them. But that&#x27;s separate from mixing it in with criticism.<p>1: I&#x27;ve low confidence in my self confidence. On one hand I know I have a fairly good error rate and I&#x27;m objectively better than a lot of other developers. Yet, especially here on HN, I can plainly see I&#x27;m nothing special. But this doesn&#x27;t really assure me that any particular piece of my work is good.",1429308413

And he is saying &quot;that&#x27;s cool, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter&quot;.<p>Now I am pretty sure he wold concede immediately that there are <i>some</i> examples where it matters, but my experience matches what he is saying very closely.<p>A little bit on my background: hired in 2003 by the BBC for the express purpose of making one of their systems faster, succeeded at around 100x - 1000x with simpler code[1], hired by Apple to work on their Mac OS X performance team, similar successes with Spotlight, Mail indexing, PDF, etc.  Also worked with/on Squeak.\nSqueak runs a bytecode interpreter, with a bunch of primitives.  The interpreter is perfectly adequate for the vast majority of the system.  Heck, the central page imposition routine in my BookLightning PDF page imposition program[2] is written in Objective-Smalltalk[3], or more precisely an interpreter for the language that&#x27;s probably the slowest computer language implementation currently in existence.  Yes it&#x27;s slower than Ruby, by a wide margin.  And yet BookLightning runs rings around similar programs that are based on Apple&#x27;s highly optimized Quartz PDF engine.  And by &quot;rings&quot; I mean order(s) of magnitude.<p>Why is BookLightning so fast?  Simple:  it knows that it doesn&#x27;t have to unpack the individual PDF pages to impose them, and is built on top of a PDF engine that allows it to do that[4].  The benefit of an optimizing compiler in this scenario?  Zilch.<p>At the BBC, the key insight was to move from 20+ machine distributed and SQL database backed system to a single jar event logger working in-memory with a filesystem based log[5].  How would a compiler make this transformation?  And after the transformation, we probably could have run interpreted byte-code and still be fast enough, though the JIT probably helped us a little bit in not having to worry about performance of the few algorithmic parts.<p>As to changing a bubblesort to a mergesort, you hand-wave around that, but I think the point is that this is not a safe transformation, because the author may have specifically chosen bubblesort because he likes its characteristics for the data he knows will be encountered (or cares more about that case).<p>When I worked at Apple, I saw the same pattern:  low-level optimizations of the type you discuss generally gained a few percent here and there, and we were happy to get them in the context of machine/system wide optimizations.  However, the application-specific optimizations that were possible when you consider the whole stack and opportunities for crossing or collapsing layer boundaries were a few factors x or orders of magnitude.<p>And here is where the &quot;optimizing compiler&quot; mindset actually starts to get downright harmful for performance:  in order for the compiler to be allowed to do a better job, you typically need to nail down the semantics much tighter, giving less leeway for application programmers.  So you make the automatic %-optimizations that don&#x27;t really matter easier by reducing or eliminating opportunities for the order-of-magnitude improvements.<p>And yes, I totally agree that optimizations should be user-visible and controllable, rather than automagically applied by the compiler.  Again, the opportunities are much bigger for the code that matters, and the stuff that is applied automatically doesn&#x27;t matter for most of the code it is applied to.<p>[1] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-9299-3_11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-9299-3...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.metaobject.com/Products/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metaobject.com/Products/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://objective.st"" rel=""nofollow"">http://objective.st</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.metaobject.com/Technology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metaobject.com/Technology/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EventPoster.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EventPoster.html</a>",1429308117

All in all, the audience did not bust out the pitchforks, although one might say that &quot;domain-specific compilers&quot; is basically the direction academia has already been heading. I doubt any of the people in the audience who were working on compilers/JITs are planning to stop working on them, though it did make for some fun dinner discussion.<p>There was one mid-talk exchange was one professor asking djb upfront whether or not he thought, in ten years, Mike Pall (author of LuaJIT) would be out of a job--after all, JITs are basically optimizing compilers. Well, the original question was more diplomatic than that, but eventually he pushed it enough that he got djb to not deny that this would be the case.<p>The talk was somewhat marred by a very large digression into an undergrad level primer of computer architecture (it probably would have been better served by an extended Q&A session), although the sorting example he finally built up to was pretty cute.",1429308059

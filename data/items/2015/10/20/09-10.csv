However, the agreement that perforce has is with my company. I&#x27;m just a number on the sheet of &quot;how many users&quot;.<p>A gmail account is a privately held account. The agreement is between me and google. Any liability is mine, and google invests heavy effort into continuing to track my via a plethora of cookies, fingerprinting techniques and other methods even after I log out. They do that on the basis that I <i>personally</i> have agreed to submit to it, my employer isn&#x27;t involved.<p>It&#x27;s on the same level as if an employer mandated which phone company you could use. I don&#x27;t mind my employer insisting on me using a specific provider, if he is providing the phone and paying for the plan. I might choose to leave that phone at work when I&#x27;m not on call though. But if it&#x27;s my phone and I&#x27;m paying for the plan, I should have the right to choose who I give my support to.<p>The alternative road takes us down a dodgy path of corporate alliances, where companies agree to have each others employees scratch their backs, and to hell with consumer rights.

Namely they, the three major and thorny ones, are ideas of God or gods, supernatural phenomenon and ideas of free will.<p>These three ideas just don&#x27;t fit with the facts. If an entity was powerful enough to create everything, what created IT? If supernatural phenomenon were real, why isn&#x27;t there solid evidence of its existence, and if it exists on a plane beyond the material then how could it ever affect the material plane we inhabit? Finally, if you accept that the universe follows certain predictable, immutable laws then you must agree that with enough information any future or past state could be predicted or recreated. Humans and their minds live within the constraints of this physical universe, thus any potential future state of mind or behavior could be predicted from the previous state(s) that human was in. All moments arise from the moments before them. There is absolutely no gap there to shimmy in ideas of &quot;free will&quot;. I was born at a certain time, place and in a certain community. I had no choice there, but the die was cast and everything I ever become will be constrained by those facts. I will never be able to magically pull myself out of this causal chain.<p>I would like to add one more thing, to counteract the possible easy pessimism that a realization like this could have on an individual. One day I realized that ghosts weren&#x27;t real. As a child, this was a burden lifted from my shoulders, as I could rest easier knowing no unpredictable and unfathomable force was going to accost me as I slept. One day I realized that there was no God. I suddenly felt freer than ever, and less self-conscious in solitude. I don&#x27;t live every day in anxiety about the &quot;lack&quot; of these two delusions. It happened once more with free will. I realized all things belong to a causal chain possibly extending into infinity, and I was just a pattern at the tail end of this chain in time. I suddenly felt more compassionate for every other human, lodged as they are in their station . You and I can&#x27;t help what we have become, what we came from or what we will be. Even knowing this, I live intentionally, not drowning in a sea of slavish fatalism, but instead with the keen knowledge that I too belong to the causal chain, and that through evolutionary machinations, my mind can suspend disbelief and still feel it is directing the future toward a desired state.<p>The paradox is difficult to rest in, but it has given me a powerful tool, another paradoxical belief, that I can control my future by knowing that I simply arise from what has past.",1445332734

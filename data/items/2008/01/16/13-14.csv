99199,comment,99092,99154,0,0,ralph,,,"Yep, the CSP style of channel communication is great.  Those thinking Erlang is better than sliced bread need to make sure they're up on what came before and after;  <a href=""http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/</a>  Personally, I find Erlang to be too clunky as a language.  Good for special purpose telephone switching software maybe, but for general programming the CSP style can be done in nicer ways than having to switch to a whole new language.",1200489346
99198,comment,99176,99176,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Yes, I think you're right that something like this could and should be done. I've been collecting ideas and experimenting with stuff like that for a long time. It's not easy. Finding datasets is not the big problem, so I think tagging datasets doesn't help as much as it does with, say, photo collections.<p>The crucial thing is data quality. You basically have three kinds of public datasets:<p>1) Academic ones, which are mostly high quality, but tend to be dusted and not kept up to date.<p>2) High quality commercial datasets, which are expensive and tightly guarded.<p>3) Free datasets of mostly low quality. Yes you can use dapper to scrape it and freebase to store it, but what's missing is a process to assure data quality. That's what a community effort could provide or coordinate. Something like apache.org for data. And there would have to be a way for non-programmers to help, because with most datasets programmers are not the ones who know the data best and the coding can be extremely dull. It's unbelievable how many different ways there are to screw up data and how difficult it is to clean. There's always some manual work left and you can't beat a pair of eyes (yet) to spot errors.<p>There would also have to be a way for users of datasets to pay a reasonable amount of money to have a particular dataset brought up to high quality standards.",1200489094
99197,comment,99053,99139,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I've dealt with a couple systems that link Lisp 'trivially' to C. When they say they link trivially, what they mean is that they let you call the function in the C library just like you'd call it from C. This is frequently extremely not how you want to do it in Lisp, and so you're forced to either a) write a Lispification layer, in which you take all the C functions and turn them into a library that acts like you want a Lisp library to act (the usual approach), or b) just write it like it's in C, which makes you very angry all day long, and also loses some of the benefit of writing in Lisp. Both approaches slow you down quite a lot. Especially if you decide not to be an asshole and release your lispification layer as open-source (which you should)-- because then people will all be pounding down your door for fixes and extensions and maintenance for new versions of the C library, which is not what you want to do. You didn't even want to write the layer to begin with, presumably.<p>So no, 'trivial' C linking not actually a silver bullet making everything hunky-dorey with respect to lack of libraries. Python has a significant advantage in that it's popular enough for many people to have already gone through the Pythonification process for most important libraries, and have also open-sourced their Pythonification layers.",1200488944
99196,comment,99053,99078,0,0,eVizitei,,,"That is a really brash statement.  Usually this kind of comment comes from someone who hasn't really explored the advantages of the different languages they've tried, they've just taken every language that's come to them and manhandled it until it felt like the language they like.  I've seen that happen before a lot,  somebody likes C very much, so when they're introduced to Lisp, they basically write C in lisp.  what does that give you?  well for one thing, you have basically a program that is no better than the C version, but with a strange syntax.  However, it means that the coder also hasn't taken advantage of the things you can do in lisp that are different from the things you can do in C.  You can't write closures in C, so if you've only ever written in C you probably won't use them when writing in Lisp, and thus it seems like a pretty useless transition.<p>Languages ARE interfaces to the computer system, but that doesn't mean that some aren't more powerful than others.  I could write a paper with a typewriter or a word processor, which are both viable ways to produce a document, but I can do things with a word processor that just aren't feasible on a typewriter.  If you've never used a word processor, you won't miss things like ""copy and paste"" or being able to tweak your margins at any time, but if you HAVE used one before you will feel stifled without those abilities.  Now, if you use a word processor, but you don't figure out how to use any of those handy features, than it's just an electronic typewriter to you and you'll say things like ""tools don't matter! Typewriters and Word Processors are just two different ways to write a paper. That's it!""<p>of course, you'll probably get a few odd looks for saying that.",1200488933

Time Capsule is a logical (and great) successor.<p>But what about linux and windows? At work I use linux and we backup with ibms tivoli software. This is crap of course, because replay of a crashed or exchanged hd requires installation of a linux system first in order to access the backup. After that the data has to be moved bit by bit and apps have to be re-installed one by one.<p>As long as I used windows (until 2000), it was even worse.\n(sidenote: the degree with which an os is called professional is reverse to its backup capabilities. This strikes me since ever!).<p>How does everybody backup their macs, linux boxes or windows systems?",1200488677

99192,comment,98704,98976,0,0,Tichy,,,"In any case, when evaluating Erlang, I found the immutable variables to be rather unpractical. I can see why they might help to avoid errors with multi threading, but I don't see a reason to be excited about it? At the end of the day, it is another limitation of the language. With Java, that is what people complain about, the constraints, why wish for it in other languages?<p>If you think that immutable variables reduce programming errors, you are free to just not change your variables anyway, I guess. No language constraint required.",1200488562

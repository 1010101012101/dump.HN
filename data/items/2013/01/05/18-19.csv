5013594,comment,5012826,5012826,12,0,driverdan,,,"I'm not surprised he got these results. While the author raises some valid points there are a lot of flaws with this. He doesn't say what the times are for. Is it the time to DOM ready? To the page completely loaded and rendered? Did he load each site at least once before running the tests to make sure CF's caches were primed?<p>CloudFlare can make your site faster <i>or</i> slower depending on how you use it and what you're serving through it. Since it's a proxy response times will be higher for dynamic content it needs to fetch (the page itself, unless it's cacheable). Static content (with proper cache headers) will be served through its CDN (everything else) which will almost always be faster, again assuming CF's cache is primed.<p>The author's finding may be accurate about a base level install of these platforms with no performance improvements. I believe that without proper caching headers CF is going to have to query your server for everything to make sure nothing has changed. Sending proper cache headers with your static files will eliminate this issue and improve your performance. AFAIK none of these platforms use proper caching headers out of the box.<p>One last nitpick. Why the hell is this article spread across 6 pages? That's incredibly useless, annoying, and takes away from the user experience.<p>Edit: Originally I called out the author for claiming his site has a PageSpeed score of 97. I did so because the site issues 57 requests, including 8 CSS and 20 JS files, some of which aren't even minified. I assumed there was no way his score could be 97 with these glaring issues. Turns out I was wrong. I tested it[1] and it <i>does</i> have a score of 97, which just goes to show that PageSpeed and YSlow have plenty of their own issues. IMO his site shouldn't have over a 90 based on these obvious and easy to fix flaws.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130105_G4_DEA/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130105_G4_DEA/</a>",1357412390

And given the harsh reality of our situation: that we live in a world which is indifferent to our survival, that it will only briefly remember any of our accomplishments, that we are more likely to go on forever struggling with our own mediocrity, we are deserving of that love and it is invaluable.  It is something that (as far as we know), our species creates that is unique.  And if it chokes us a little bit and if it stunts our growth, then that is acceptable bargain for the brief memories of peace and happiness that it will create for us, which we can carry with us on our long journey to the grave.",1357412363

Traditional values suggest that ""'til death do us part"" is the desired level of permanence, but as a society (even preceding online dating) we've been moving away from that idea. More specifically, it used to be somewhat taboo for a widow to remarry, but now it's almost expected that a young widow will eventually find another spouse.<p>As our expected lifespan grows, are the costs and benefits of fully committing to a single person changing? As far as kids are concerned, you want a marriage to last long enough to get the kids to a certain degree of autonomy, but is that level changing too (which is interesting, because it might seem that kids are taking longer to gain autonomy compared to a hundred years ago).<p>But we all expect to become grandparents. This is clearly beyond the point where you need to commit to a spouse for childhood reasons. Is our changing environment enough to justify an expectation that marriage should no longer be permanent?",1357412277

I have only a few personal insights to share as I don't code much these days.<p>1. I got introduced to C in 80's via some popular book. K&R not only taught me C but also was my entry point into the systems programing world. Before K&R, the BASIC programming books never allowed me to deal with memory or interrupt vectors in the way C allowed me.<p>2. C has a great power dynamic built in to it. You are on your own in dealing with this power. It's you who crashed the machine, not C and surely not K&R C.<p>3. Almost every language since C has borrowed something from C. Hence, anytime I saw a familiar notation or code block in any language that reminded me of C, I got confidence that I can learn this language.<p>K&R's many virtues give it an unique status. It did something that no C book or website can do it. It is the word of the language designer themselves. They shared their reasons of the choices they made.",1357412210

But taking the static asset load off of heroku without a Rube Goldberg CDN deployment is great, IMO: they just leverage standard HTTP caching headers and then those requests rarely if ever hit your dynos, like the old varnish functionality you got with bamboo stack on heroku.  It's much more brain dead, which works for me.<p>I don't use or care much for all the dynamic optimization they offer (I turned it all off) and, with respect to the SSL cert, I don't really care about how it is issued (to a first approximation, no one looks at certs except the browser verifying the cert against the URL) but YMMV.<p>It does appear that wildcard certs have gotten <i>very</i> cheap now: <a href=""http://www.namecheap.com/ssl-certificates/comodo.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.namecheap.com/ssl-certificates/comodo.aspx</a> so the cost savings isn't as great as I thought.

A new language showing up doesn't mean it will gain any traction.<p>As for the higher level languages closing the gap, that is certainly not my experience and I've seen no benchmarks to this effect. And I'm not talking about Python or Ruby and the likes which are in an entirely different category, I'm talking about C#, Java, etc. They are still alot slower on cpu intensive code, also they certainly doesn't fulfill other important properties of C like small memory footprint.<p>The notion that there was some 'magic piece of the puzzle' missing which has been solved in making high level languages perform like low level languages like C comes across as nonsense to me. Higher level languages sacrifice speed for convenience and safety, depending on your demands that can often be a very wise sacrifice, in the areas where C excels it's likely often not.<p>Also cell-phones (which are really the upper-end of 'embedded') run a kernel and system-level code written in C doing the heavy lifting system-wise, also performance demanding applications (higher-end games) are often still written in native code on these phones.<p>There's certainly room for a more 'modern' C, maybe something else has replaced C in 10 years, but I don't see it being any of the languages we are discussing today, not even Rust.

But Microsoft IS in fact a strategic threat to Google, and Google constantly thinks about how to compete effectively against it. To do otherwise would be stupid, which Google is not.<p>> it ignores the very simple fact that any organization is made up of people with very different opinions<p>Of course Google is a very large company, and has many people inside it with many different opinions (and as you say, many are great people that truly care about the open web). But like any corporation, it is hierarchical and its leaders at the top do define an overall coherent strategy for the company as a whole. A company that does not do that is doomed to failure, and there are of course plenty of examples in history.<p>Google's overall strategy with respect to the web has shifted in recent years, with less support for alternative browsers on desktop and especially mobile. This makes business sense for Google - supporting other browsers in some cases might help them compete against Google, which like any company Google wants to prevent. This is not unique to Google; what is, is that years ago Google was very different - it didn't have it's own browser and OS, and it supported openness on the web, that openness helped Google as a new company making money on the web. But that openness is no longer crucial to Google's strategy, and that is affecting Google's products more and more.",1357410544

Premarital sex \n  used to be taboo, explains Biderman. So women would become miserable in marriages, because they \n  wouldnt know any better. But today, more people have had failed relationships, recovered, moved on, and \n  found happiness. They realize that that happiness, in many ways, depends on having had the failures. As \n  we become more secure and confident in our ability to find someone else, usually someone better, monogamy \n  and the old thinking about commitment will be challenged very harshly.\n</code></pre>\nOh man. Societal values will always lose out? <i>Women</i> (just women, mind you! Not men, or women <i>and</i> men?) were miserable in marriages because premarital sex was taboo? The lack of premarital sex directly leads to unhappy marriages? Some of these quotes border on the ridiculous. Personally, I'm glad the societal value of ""Murder is wrong"" hasn't lost out to these dating websites. I'm going to pile on real quick and also point out that commitment is hard. It's a disturbing trend that people can now just not deal with commitment (an important societal need, not just in relationships but in business as well) since sites like these offer them an easy way out.<p>I'm far from the evangelical Christian right, but there is no denying family values play a part in a functional society. Stable homes and good role models are invaluable to children growing up. Good marriages can demonstrate valuable social skills, such as compromise, respect and as corny as it sounds, love. Such things should never ""lose out"".<p>Let's not forget that, as the article mentions, most of these people's goal is to generate repeat users, not create healthy relationships. I'm not denying that online dating can be a great tool, but let's take some of these opinions with a grain of salt.",1357410400

Ultimately, we had to do an emergency switch to another CDN because the performance was SOOOOOO bad and we had an important event occurring the following day (Not the ideal time to be playing with DNS on a production website).<p>The Theory behind CloudFlare makes sense right? They'll protect you from DDOS by getting everyone onto their network, so the network gets so big no one can take it down and they have specialized equipment and techniques. Well, maybe that makes sense if you have a problem with DDOS, but if you don't, why join a network that is obviously being DDOS every day? That doesn't make much sense to me. I assume they were being DDOS'd because every time they went down, taking us with them, that's what they would said on twitter.<p>The worse part was response times. With them, individual assets where taken around 500ms to 800ms to load. Once we switched to another service provider, we were seeing around 20ms-30ms. And if it's not already obvious, dynamic pages served off Heroku are faster if they're not stuck behind CloudFlare. Our total cold page load time when from 5s-6s down to 2s with this switch.<p>Also, all the asset rewriting and page optimization magic is so silly IMOHO. Just use a good framework like ROR with Asset Pipeline and write good code and you won't have that problem. Not like for a small site it should be much of a problem, and for a big site, they should have competent programmers and adequate resources.<p>Also the SSL Cert they give you sucks. It will have a bunch of other companies names on it, and perhaps besides allowing you to rollout SSL very quickly and easily, doesn't do much in the way of validating your identity.<p>I wish CloudFlare luck, and hopefully they will fix their issues.

Perhaps monogamy makes less sense today. This is a dangerous subject... it certainly isn't something I can talk to my partner about openly. But that's why I bring it up: perhaps as a society we need to start admitting that we have changed our level of expectations on what is okay for activity partners and perhaps even sex partners, with members of the opposite sex.<p>Perhaps we can have our cake and eat it too. We should acknowledge that long-term relationships built on friendships may not always provide all the perks we expect in this internet age. Perhaps we need not lose these wonderful relationships in the wake... rather have both.<p>I'm not offering a clear path for how it would work or how to get there.

I distilled my understanding of that dissatisfaction down and realized that I'm always consuming nowadays (video games, reddit, HN, music, movies, food, etc.) and hardly producing anything. I think we're all defined by what we create and the best place to look when we're feeling out of sorts is in the fruits of our labor. I was always creating something when I was younger. A comic book in high school, short stories and poetry in college, and nothing significant now since about 2006 except for a huge home renovation and having two great kids. So, once I realized (within the past 4 months) that I've stopped being a creator and haven't been following my passions, I started taking steps to correct that. I just got accepted to grad school for Software Engineering, so hopefully that'll be the first step towards some significant progress, but I'm also trying to take on some personal projects.

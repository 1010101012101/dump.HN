Their buses are no better.<p>Getting to/from downtown and to the Outer Sunset <i>easily</i> takes an hour on severely over-capacity rail cars - a distance of a mere 6 miles. At rush hour the cars are <i>literally</i> packed - these are the most crowded transit vehicles I've ever been on on this continent, NYC included.<p>Their on-time performance is atrocious, frequently late by <i>over 100%</i> of their frequency (e.g., an every-15 schedule routinely results in trains late by more than 15 min).<p>So not only are the vehicles slow and infrequent, but they routinely fail to show up when they're supposed to. <i>Every</i> major study into public transit use will tell you that schedule reliability is <i>critical</i> to establishing a transportation network - without the ability to reliably make transfers people will simply stop using the system. The last I saw of it, MUNI vehicles were on time only <i>57% of the time</i> (lateness is defined as being within 4 minutes of schedule, which in any large city transit is a margin as wide as a football field).<p>Large swathes of the city are <i>entirely</i> not served by anything even pretending to be mass transit - Pac Heights, Inner/Outer Richmond, the Marina, Russian Hill, are all big neighborhoods that are <i>completely</i> disconnected from any form of mass transit, BART, MUNI, or otherwise.<p>Buses are even worse off than light rail - there have been many efforts to improve the bus system to little effect. Efforts to make commutes substantially shorter (by taking out <i>extremely</i> closely spaced stops) have been repeatedly rejected by members of the public, who will proceed to complain about MUNI anyways.<p><i>Literally</i> the only neighborhoods that have effective mass transit are the ones lucky enough to be connected to BART (read: Mission, Bernal, Balboa Park). These are the only neighborhoods that have access to a transportation system that is frequently on-time and actually reasonably fast. The BART has a slew of its own problems, but it's about 10x better than MUNI for getting people around.<p>SF isn't the worst transit system I've ever had to use regularly (Seattle takes the cake there, just barely), but it's <i>severely</i> under-developed and under-funded for a city of San Francisco's stature and ambitions (i.e., its very open goal of creating a car-free/car-reduced city). I dare say that if you do not own a car in San Francisco you will spend a significant sum on taxis, or Uber, or SideCar, or any of the other services that have been born from City Hall's transportation failure. That or you bike a lot.",1353535181

Even knowing their importance, especially in mission critical roles such as aerospace and medical, it is hard to reason that all the time and creative energy spent on most standards is worth it. Especially since standards evolve by being broken or ignored, creating flux that makes the standard meaningless.<p>I think the need to form standards are a symptom of poor tools and methodologies for software development.<p>Robust software needs to be built using first principles. Instead of forming standards in such situations to enforce coding style, we should be improving our tooling, and not be writing code at all. The tools are the standard.<p>Code is a creative free form medium, and ignoring its raison d'tre means killing what it is.

It works extremely well, in a vacuum, or on the site it was made popular, reddit. Their, the original poster writes the TL;DR, which is why it works so well. If you write a large post, then immediately after summarize the post into 1-2 sentences, it becomes a very efficient message that still expresses exactly what you wanted to get across. TL;DR is the future, almost to a sad degree. A lot of time it digs deeper than just wanting to filter out the articles you have no interest in reading. But this becomes the only form of digesting news. You begin consuming a lot of news, stories, articles, but you're no longer actually informed on any of the topics, you just end up with a vague idea of what is going on around you. That's far beside the point though.<p>This is a actually a very nice effort.<p>The issues I have with growth and actual value, is with how the summaries are generated. Automatic generation is fast and inaccurate, manually curated is slow and very accurate. In a world where people no longer have the time to read newspapers, their not only looking for quick news on the run, they want current news. Something that happened today, everything that happened today. But quick, not the full story, ""i'll read that later."" Meeting in the middle between fast and slow approaches does not work here. You're too slow, and the headlines in my RSS feed and twitter have already informed me of the news, too fast and your summary becomes a failed attempt to make twitter and RSS better quality. I have no idea how your TL;DR are currently generated. But I would think you'd have an aggregation and be doing some manual curation. To me for this to really work, you'd have to have a large group of people that read the article generating the TL;DR, constantly iterating, until you end up with an extremely efficient 2 sentence summary. Or there needs to be a project that integrates TL;DR on large scale, the publishers, news papers of the world, blogs..They submit these directly.<p>I think there's still a lot of value in what you're doing. I just don't think it will take off as it is now. Away from the name/marketing/novelty/social aspect not really being there. Twitter, RSS feeds, and sites like <a href=""http://skimfeed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skimfeed.com/</a> end up providing me with far more day to day value.

And for indentation, it doesn't complain as long as you're consistent (for both tabs vs. spaces, and if you choose spaces, consistent with the number of spaces).<p>Go, on the other hand, checks for many aspects of style at compile-time.  If you include an opening brace on the same line, import a package that isn't used, define a variable that isn't needed... all of those will cause compile-time errors.<p>At first, it can get annoying - especially when you comment out a single line when debugging and then realize you have to make some other minor change elsewhere just to avoid one of the aforementioned style issues.<p>But on the other hand, I can't deny that it makes my own code cleaner, and it probably saves some errors down the line. Furthermore, it made my code more consistent with existing Go code right from Day 1, even when I was just learning the language. Furthermore, for anybody who wants to do any metaprogramming/code translation, having a more rigid syntax enforced by the compiler is very helpful.<p>Python doesn't do that. PEP8 is great, and I'm thankful that it's very widely followed. But it's much more powerful when these issues of ""style"" are made as mandatory as any other aspect of the language specification[1].<p>This ""benevolent dictator"" approach has its pluses and minuses, but having written  Go code a short while now, I've come to appreciate some of its benefits in the case of coding style.<p>[1] Okay, so the Go language specification doesn't include all of these, and yes, there are two independent Go compilers.

4816362,comment,4814249,4816016,5,0,pnathan,,,"The simple answer is that software has social value, and that it ethically ought be modifiable by its users.<p>Two key things have driven my desires for a GPL world. (1) Reading about historical software now unavailable and (2) working in the corporate world as a tools developer.<p>The question is pretty much, are you weighing the distributor's freedom more than the user's freedom?  When you want someone to be able to use your program and <i>not</i> publish their fixes, MIT-style licenses become more your style. This is preferred by corporations, AFAICT. However, when you want the end user to be able to modify software and to be able to <i>trust</i> the software, you start wanting the GPL world.   Of course, the idea of a typical non-technical user doing technical work is illogical. But with the GPL, they have the freedom to hire people to do technical work.  That can be really important for things like crypto!<p>Another way to consider the situation is that the GPL enables viral transmission, and more broadly, forcibly enables a survival of the fittest. If software is really good and GPL, it'll get used, and the users <i>must</i> publish to their users, and so forth. So good software can now survive longer, perhaps after its starting point's death. This in particular struck home with me when I was reading of the software systems from the '50s and '60s. They were doing things then that were not to be done for decades. As a social value, some of those old software systems would have been tremendous. I'd like to build on old & reliable stuff, not reinvent the wheel!<p>A concrete way to approach this idea is to consider infrastructure tooling. I write that, every day. It's my job. Sometimes I ask myself: Don't a <i>hundred</i> other companies already do this? What if software licenses were so written as to require these tools to also be published? We've been able to publish one Mercurial extension, and it has been a great experience.  <i>But what if we did that with everything?</i>  I wish all the companies that developed infrastructure opened their source and worked with each other to build a common world of amazing. The GPL style license is key, because it requires this republishing thing. Under the GPL, sharing becomes required. And then someone else can build on that, and they must also share their additions.<p>That's the kind of world I want to live in. Not a world where we guard our little towers replicating each other's work time after time. We can go do different things, safe in the knowledge that in the common areas, improvements will be published and worked on by all.<p>edit: With respect to RMS-<p>In particular, his short story Right to Read really hit home with me when I read it in 2008 or so. I have read one or two other things by him from the... 90s I think... that really indicated he understands the logical outworkings of certain processes, as his predictions came to pass in the late '00s.  I figure if you're going to agree with someone, you had best agree with someone who seems to be proven right. :-)",1353532748

If Facebook protected it with a random key, and you noticed the key generator was flawed so knowing I live in, say, Montana you could bruteforce this generator in 3 days, and you wrote a script that indeed in three days bruteforced the key - yes, it would be ""hacking Facebook"". And if you took these photos and 100K of other photos and, saying nothing to facebook or me, went to the press - yes, it would expose you to criminal charges. If you intention was good, you would have stopped with one photo and notified facebook and/or myself and you would not write a tool to harvest and keep 100K of them. Creating and using such tool is what got them into trouble, not visiting some page or discovering some flaw. If you see neighbors door is open, you're not criminal.

This provides a nice cushioning effect for emergencies using very little besides the components already in the system.<p>If you were to even partially evacuate the tube then that would no longer work and you'd need active braking at all times.<p>Accelerating into the at a speed slightly higher than the loop speed backing into a slug that has <i>just</i> passed might be a way to mitigate this to some extent, then you still have to worry about stopping the train but the braking energy could be dispersed over a much longer distance due to closer packing.<p>I missed the end of the interview linked by someone else in the other thread where Elon Musk says it has no 'right of way' issues so I think the whole thing is moot but it was a fun exercise anyway.",1353531781

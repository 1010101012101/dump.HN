661680,comment,661440,661490,0,0,vidarh,,,"True. On the other hand the longer you wait the more likely you are of having established a high cost of living for yourself and other limiting factors.<p>Example: I have a mortgage, a wife who is studying and a 6 week old baby.<p>Today I need to bring in at least 2500 GBP after tax per month for us to break even or set aside sufficient savings first to make up for the shortfall; when I started my first company I had no dependents, no commitments of any kind, shared a flat with my co-founders that we rented for about 1000 GBP/month, and beyond that we paid ourselves 600GBP/month each. There were four of us, so in effect we were each living on 850 GBP/month after tax while getting things off the ground.<p>In other words the threshold for me to start a company now is much higher than it was, and that is excluding the ""luxuries"" that drives the income I <i>expect</i> to have even higher. Then I could jump at anything exciting; now I won't consider something unless I think it has a reasonable shot at making me a solid salary and with a shot at making it big.<p>Doesn't mean I'm not still working on various ideas, but it takes more before I can afford to take the risk of going it full time and I need to choose more carefully.<p>If you have a good idea, right after (or before - I quit after a year, but since went back and got a degree) university is a good time to throw yourself into it. You're likely used to living on little money.<p>If you make it big, it doesn't matter, and if you don't you get plenty of chances to have a go at the grind of a larger company later while contemplating your next move.",1245239753

The responses seem pretty good, although one of the three recommended for me is giving invalid data for google.com, and it's giving me the same three servers for several different connections in the USA, some very distant from others.<p>I have my reservations about blindly using DNS servers without verifying their ownership and control. Consider entering ""www.wellsfargo.com"" into a browser. If a bogus DNS server returned a hacker's server, it could redirect you to wellsfargo.wildcard-cert-based-attacker.com. The people here might figure out that something is awry, but I think we all know people that would not catch it. Of course this is possible in theory even without the DNS server operator being malicious, but it's considerably more difficult.",1245238325
661660,comment,660066,661506,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The idea that good products sell themselves and ""marketing after-the-fact can't fix a turd"" is largely a myth. Look at Hendrick's gin. It tastes like Pinesol, but because they came out with this clever marketing campaign saying ""only 1 in 1000 gin drinkers prefers the taste of Hendrick's"" it's now one of the hottest selling new liquors on the market. And I have friends who've never even been to a gin tasting who swear backwards and forwards that it's better than Hayman's or Bulldog or whatever. Hendrick's sells itself on quality only in the sense that the marketing is the product.<p>Now if you're making something like a car then clearly taking a strategy like Hendrick's is going to catch up with you, like it did for GM. But the fact is that you can make just as money selling gin as you can selling cars, so why go through the pain of designing the car?",1245238292

661658,comment,658805,658805,0,0,gexla,,,"As I mentioned in another thread, I'm a U.S. citizen doing web dev in the Philippines.  I would like to start checking out other places soon but for right now I'm still trying to get used to my first move to a new country.<p>There are a ton of people doing this and writing about it, so just do a search on the net.  Make a list of places you would like to go and do the research on each place.<p>Considerations, especially for starting out, is visa, language, infrastructure, cost of living and other items.<p>For example, the Philippines has an easy visa where you only have to do visa runs once every 16 months.  English is spoken nearly everywhere which isn't a small village off the beaten path.  The infrastructure is not the best in some areas.  I have to deal with a lot of brownouts and the internet has it's issues sometimes as well.  Thailand is probably just a little more expensive than the Philippines but has better infrastructure.  You don't want to be in the middle of a project and then have the power go out, but it happens.<p>I generally keep pretty busy as a contractor but I know developers here who will do a 3K site and then take the next couple of months off.<p>Ultimately, if you have an income and a bit of savings it's pretty easy.  Just make sure you have enough savings to get you through a six month dry period and then enough extra to buy the next flight out of the country in case you need to leave in a hurry. Take a month or so break from work so that you have plenty of time to focus on getting settled in your new destination, especially if it's  your first move.  After that, perhaps you can get up to speed faster with future moves.",1245238271

Chargebacks through Google Checkout were so bad that we dropped them.<p>We went with Authorize.net as the gateway and another company for our merchant account. A lot of chargebacks can be handled by setting up your risk controls up-front correctly. Should the postal code be required to match? Should the card verification code be required? Those types of things have more to do with it than anything IMO.",1245237686

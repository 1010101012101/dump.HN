You can&#x27;t expect to stand out on the strength of your ideas, gameplay or story alone. You have to work to find an audience for them, and then work to get those people to buy your product, at full price. Good games are <i>almost</i> a commodity now. The developer is one of the few points of difference buyers pay attention to.<p>&quot;You can be 50% off one sale and then 75% the next. Nobody will notice.&quot; I disagree with this; once you put it on a temporary sale or in a bundle, many people are content to wait until it goes on sale for lower. I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of Reddit threads where people asked, &quot;Will [game x] go lower than $1.49?&quot;",1446523174

He thought that the solution would somehow come to him more easily the more &quot;abstract&quot; (in his terms) the code became, and went steadfastly down that path - until common sense took over and he came to me wondering what he did and why it didn&#x27;t work.",1446523157

Good luck getting your interesting research to compile elsewhere with that makefile that you copied off of stackoverflow and edited with hardcoded values until it built.<p>This past summer I worked for about a week and a half with a local startup trying to exist in fitness-watch IoT. They wanted to flash the boards with some proprietary tool provided in the board devkit. I wanted to flash the board using flashrom. They were content using a cloud compiler that had a costly license and hooked in the bootloader magically using a closed source library. I wanted to get us using arm-none-eabi- and a proper build system.<p>They wanted to press a green button in their IDE. They wanted their familiar starting point of<p><pre><code>    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {  }\n\n</code></pre>\nAnd that&#x27;s the real hidden tax of not learning this &quot;bullshittery&quot;-- a lack of an ability or urge to learn or do more. Oh, we need to do OTA flashing? Well we don&#x27;t understand the bootloader. Or the flashing process.<p>Good. luck. with. that.<p>And I guess that&#x27;s fine if your goal is just to make theoretical software for a paper. But if you&#x27;re trying to make code that isn&#x27;t meant to be disposed of, you need to know what&#x27;s going on underneath-- you need to be able to explore things from first principles.",1446523149

10497407,comment,10496788,10497152,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I&#x27;m curious - what&#x27;s your motivation for being interested in tech?  Have you given some thought about what drives you?<p>I&#x27;ve found, personally, that my motivation has changed fairly dramatically over the years, and with it, my perspective on high-level vs. low-level programming.  When I was in high school and college, my motivation was that I wanted to <i>feel competent</i> - I wanted a skill that was all my own, that I could master without anyone telling me I had to.  Immediately after college, through my first job & startup, my motivation was to <i>get rich</i>, or at least develop a financial position better than my peers.  While I was at Google, my motivation was to <i>earn the respect of my peers</i>, and now that I&#x27;m out on my own trying out startup ideas, my motivation is to <i>test my intuitions about the software industry</i>.<p>When I wanted to feel competent or earn the respect of my peers, I&#x27;ve usually gravitated toward low-level technologies and concepts, things that were hard conceptually or close to the machine but didn&#x27;t have much practical application.  Haskell, lambda calculus, compiler design, blazingly fast code, the bits & bytes of network protocols.  When I wanted to get rich or test out my ideas, I&#x27;ve gravitated toward very high-abstraction, productivity-enhancing, flavor-of-the-month technologies.  Javascript (in 2007, before it became hot), frontend dev, Polymer, React, native mobile development, Parse & Firebase, etc.  I currently care very little about tech, because I&#x27;ve learned that in the grand scheme of things it will usually not make-or-break a business idea.<p>When I read your post, I&#x27;m curious why you use terms like &quot;wimpy abstraction user&quot; or &quot;superficial pleasantries&quot; or &quot;generations of programmers who not only don&#x27;t know this stuff&quot;.  That seems to imply that you don&#x27;t respect these programmers.  Why?  Frontend devs frequently make more than backend devs, and have many more job opportunities to choose from.  The people who make the most (founding CEOs) often have the wimpiest coding skills of all.  What makes for a status hierarchy where the closer to the machine you are, the higher the status?  Not saying it&#x27;s wrong - I&#x27;ve certainly felt like this at times too.  But given that I&#x27;m now in my &quot;study reality and poke it in certain ways to see why it behaves like it does&quot; phase, I&#x27;m curious.<p>FWIW, paradoxically I&#x27;ve found that each time I&#x27;ve moved from a core motivation, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve found that I can never achieve what was motivating me.  So my &quot;feel competent&quot; phase ended when I started digging deeper into all the subfields of computer science and realized I could never master it all.  My &quot;get rich&quot; phase ended when I realized that I already had enough and no matter how much money I earned, there would always be something else I might want, if I let myself.  My &quot;respect of my peers&quot; phase ended when I realized that there will always be some people who liked you and some people who hated you and that which side they fell on depended more on how you treat <i>them</i> than on anything you accomplish yourself, so really all I needed was the respect of myself.  Maybe the &quot;test my intuitions&quot; phase will end when I decide that no matter how much information I have or what I experience, there will always be an alternate explanation, but I suspect that will trigger an existential crisis that I&#x27;m not quite ready for.  There&#x27;s probably some brilliant Nietzschean revelation in there somewhere, but I&#x27;ll settle for some observations on status & respect in programming communities. ;-)",1446523097

Developers invest a ton of their base commodity (time) into a game, but refuse to advertise it or fail to save cash to do so. Instead they rely on front pages, bundles, and sales. Then 9 months latter they do post mortems, where they correlated sales graphs to events. I want to see a sale graph for conversions based on Facebook ads. Mobile/FB Game companies pump out mediocre games, but maintain huge user bases just  because people find their games.<p>Everything thinks that they are going to be Notch and their game will spread by word-of-mouth, because they have a unicorn.

I agree mostly with the counter arguments you received.<p>Do you not see how difficult it is to identify what money is being spent in support of political campaigns and what money is not?  Or, do you trust people who are corrupting politics to properly label how they are spending money as either a) <i>on</i> politics or b) <i>not on</i> politics?  If not, who will figure it out and how?  What if a foreign company starts advertising online?  Do we censor that?  Do we forbid US companies from investing in them which is a form of indirect support?<p>The whole reason I posted the above was to raise awareness that simply ending citizens united is not a whole solution unto itself.

That function hasn&#x27;t been used anywhere else in the code base before. Also, the code uses two conditionals. Here is how it should have been written:<p><pre><code>    if (mtu < hlen + sizeof(struct frag_hdr) + 8)\n      goto fail_toobig;\n    mtu -= hlen + sizeof(struct frag_hdr);\n</code></pre>\nIt takes the same number of lines, doesn&#x27;t need a little-known helper function, is clearer in its intent and is easier to read.

There are other means to bring about behavioural correction, but that was beyond the scope of my comments.<p>> Both the extensive use of the class form and punitive damages (or close substitutes) are virtually unique to the United States.<p>At least a dozen states have class procedures, but you may be right on punitive damages.  Canada is quite close, but punitive measures are handed out sparingly.<p>>> Ad hoc regulation by an entrepreneurial plaintiff&#x27;s bar acting without meaningful client input is not the not the only effective means to regulate businesses.<p>I partially agree; class proceedings are a poor substitute for regulation.  However, a few points.  First, in tandem with victim compensation and reduced litigation costs, some argue the behavioural modification aspect from financial consequence can act as a check-and-balance that requires no arbitrary intervention by the government to correct and prevent wrongdoing.<p>Second, class action are procedural in nature and the substance of the case must be founded on existing laws – often common law torts, but sometimes regulatory or administrative. The cost of enforcement via a class proceeding is relieved from the public purse, and no additional rights are conferred on victims by way of a class proceeding – only the vehicle for exercising those rights is modified.<p>Third, regulators are often not as aligned with victims as plaintiff lawyers in class proceedings.  It is not unheard of, and in some places quite common, for regulators to be hired by the very institutions they are charged with regulating.<p>Moreover, one can gauge the effectiveness of the class proceeding in behavioural modification by observing the broad resistance to it, namely the widespread introduction of arbitration clauses.  Perhaps not the behaviour it was intended to modify, but that itself speaks to the point.<p>> On the contrary, plenty of countries arguably do a better job without the use of them at all.<p>I tend to agree, depending on the circumstances, but it is a hotly contested point.",1446520578

I came to computing from the reverse direction (I did theoretical math in grad school and then steadily needed to become better at programming as I needed it in industrial jobs). At first I thought a lot of stuff classified as &#x27;bullshittery&#x27; and that with convenience tools like MATLAB, most of it was obsolete and taking time away from focusing on the supposedly more fundamental &quot;real work&quot; of some domain science.<p>But as I have gone down rabbit holes with Haskell, C, LLVM, and some other tools, I have discovered that seeing those 400 different implementations of basic data structures has been extremely helpful. Reading and re-reading decades-old tutorials on finer points of gdb and memory layout and books on what NUMA-aware memory architectures are like has been extremely educational and important. I would now regard MATLAB, and even the idea of wanting a prototyping platform like MATLAB, as bullshittery.<p>I used to think that progress, so to speak, in computing was supposed to mean less and less need to be proficient with low-level tools, and a constant push to abstract away the low level and use languages or tools that offer the same things in a high level, black box manner.<p>But I totally don&#x27;t think this any more. Now I want to be a power user of all the low level things and I wish that the surface area of tech and science wasn&#x27;t growing so fast that it forces me to be a wimpy abstraction user in a lot of domains that I don&#x27;t have time for.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m just adding my perspective that the attitude that seemingly cumbersome low-level stuff that was formerly instructional but now abstracted is a nuisance is wrong. The world overall doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough competent technicians and engineers who really know (intuition in the fingertips) that low level stuff, and we&#x27;re allowing the superficial pleasantries of limiting abstractions to raise up generations of programmers who not only don&#x27;t know this stuff at all, but also aren&#x27;t even curious about how it works. They can do jobs when the black box abstractions are working, but as soon as something breaks, they don&#x27;t know how to fix it.<p>Maybe one way to say it is that we&#x27;re breeding programmers who have shifted their curiosity away from how fundamental atomic parts aggregate to make functioning tools and towards how to permute a series of ready-made black box abstractions for some social-level end goal (e.g. how do I permute Heroku and Postgres and Spark ML to make a recommender system) -- but it&#x27;s not actually clear to me that it&#x27;s better in a utilitarian sense that we&#x27;re supposedly &quot;freed&quot; from our low level chains to think about these one-level-up problems.",1446519661

Politicians do in fact, generally, lie more than most people.<p>In particular many of the successful ones. It&#x27;s often a large part of how they got successful. You could almost say it&#x27;s part of their job (fortunately, there are some politicians that do not believe this).<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s for a (relatively) benign reason, a &quot;political white lie&quot; if you like. But just as often (if not more often) it&#x27;s to protect their own interests, or the interests of certain parties (corporations, usually) that are not quite aligned with the people they are supposed to be representing.<p>The fact that some of their statements are public just matches the fact that many people in the public may have an idea or opinion about that statement and can judge it. Say your neighbour lies about having borrowed your hedge-trimmer. If that statement were to become public, I still wouldn&#x27;t be able to judge its truthfulness.<p>Of course a public statement raises the bar because it has more eyes on it, but even non-public lies involving just a few people generally have the tendency to come out eventually, if it matters and they pay some attention. I believe their statements being public only explains a small part of why politicians are so often caught lying.<p>Another way to look at it is to consider other public figures that are not politicians. They don&#x27;t lie nearly as often. In particular, public figures like those &quot;tonight&quot; talkshow hosts, such as Stewart or Oliver. And you know why they often don&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; to lie, because they can <i>afford</i> to. And when they do lie (because occasionally they do), and I caught them at it, it wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out why, and it always involved some other entity such that they couldn&#x27;t afford not lying[0]. So when they are affected by the same reason why politicians tend to lie more often.<p>Of course, none of us never lies. I don&#x27;t think it would be entirely impossible, but it would probably be very very hard. However I do believe that there&#x27;s a quite wide spectrum from people that lie very little, to people that really lie very often (and therefore don&#x27;t think much of doing it). And politicians most definitely tend to be found at the far end of that spectrum.<p>[0] ignoring obvious lies for comedic value. Let&#x27;s call that &quot;fiction&quot; or something, conflating it with the other types of lies we are discussing here will just confuse matters.",1446519616

And yes, the folks I&#x27;ve run across at Redstone have indeed been using typical commercial tools like SAP (favorite quote: &quot;Why is this database column named &#x27;herst&#x27;?&quot;), DOORS, and some really horrible contract management stuff, and the usual assorted (SAP and otherwise) portals. And indeed, Java; I think I heard that the Army guys upgraded past 1.4 a couple of years ago.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get started about cost-plus contracting, but here&#x27;s a tip, if you&#x27;re ever in that business again: hire friendly, personable, but not overly skilled people.<p>The government side is divided into two groups: program management, which are really only concerned with the money going out and are the other half of the contracting follies (see my DAU link previous), and project management; people who are on one hand interested in getting their work done and in the other on increasing the size and importance of their empires. Neither would know technical work from a hole in the ground, or if they did it was so long ago as to be irrelevant.<p>The project folks are on your side since the more there are of you, the more important they look. If your employees are good at being friendly with them, you&#x27;re golden. All you have to do is convince the program management people that you&#x27;re working really, really hard and that the problems are very, very difficult (hence the &quot;not overly skilled&quot; part), and the project managers will do most of that for you.<p>Just don&#x27;t ever, ever, convert a cost-plus contract (where you as the prime contractor have cost-plus subcontracts) to fixed-price while not changing the subcontracts to fixed price. (And I&#x27;m looking at you, SAIC.)<p>There is one difference, in my experience between contracting commercially and for the government. The overhead for me when I was doing work for IBM (in the 90&#x27;s and &#x27;00s) was 13-15%; the overhead for me doing work for NASA was somewhere close to 100%, judging by the GSA schedules for related contracts---I never could find the schedule for UNITeS or EAST.",1446519610

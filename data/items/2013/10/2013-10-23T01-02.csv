But enough of the Apple sensationalism, in fact, this is just not true.<p>The OSs are only now free as upgrades, sure this seems free from the end-user point of view, the real money is made (by Microsoft) on the licenses manufacturers and businesses pay for the OS. I suspect the &#x27;upgrade&#x27; fees were always just a nice icing on the cake.<p>Furthermore, with the free upgrades, OS companies get to decide when you are forced to update your hardware. Automatically stripping the availability for hardware more than two years old (as I believe Apple have done with iOS7) means that those devices now feel ages older. Both Microsoft and Apple can play this game where devices runnning an older chip are not allowed to upgrade and possibly not allowed to run newer programs, suggesting/forcing the user to purchase new hardware.",1382493494

Microsoft played to its strengths by buying Nokia, but that&#x27;s the only strength Microsoft has in this brave new world of lightweight, portable always-on devices, and its nowhere near enough. The organisation just isn&#x27;t capable of producing a smartphone consumers will want to own and use.<p>Take my wife: she&#x27;s no computer lover, and certainly not a Linux nerd or Mac fanboy. She has to use computers in her day-to-day life, and she finds it stressful and confusing. But she loves her Android Nexus 7. In her mind, the Nexus 7 tablet and her Windows laptop belong in different categories. If I told her someone was trying to merge those categories (&quot;The guys who make Windows and Excel are going to make smartphones. Do you want one?&quot;) I know she&#x27;d run a mile.<p>I can understand why we have very different takes on Microsoft. I&#x27;m also well aware that Microsoft have solved a whole lot of problems so well that people don&#x27;t even think about them any more. And I LOVE the awesome work you guys do in MSR. But I don&#x27;t see enough of that awesome in the products people have to work with every day, and in the smartphone market that&#x27;s going to hurt!",1382492759

6596154,comment,6595993,6595993,40,0,tptacek,,,"The Digital Bond blog, which covers the computer security subfield of SCADA assessments, is spinning this story pretty hard, which I think you&#x27;ll see pretty quickly if you skim the actual court order.<p>What&#x27;s happening here is that Cory Thuen, a former developer of a network security product called Sophia at a company called Batelle, was fired (he did not &quot;leave&quot;) apparently after it was determined that he was making a personal copy of Sophia called Visdom that he planned on open sourcing. When Thuen went on to start his own company to release Visdom (Southfork), Batelle sued for copyright infringement.<p>Two things are happening at this point in the story, if I&#x27;m following it right. First, Batelle has prevailed in a preliminary injunction ordering Thuen to take down Visdom. It did so by making a showing that convinced the court it was likely to prevail in its suit, and that argument included admissions from Thuen that he had copied at least some of Sophia.<p>Next, Thuen is being ordered to comply with discovery in the suit. Hard drive images are standard ESI evidence in cases like these; it is not at all weird that a court would order an image of a hard drive. The idea that an adversary in a civil proceeding might get access to content like this isn&#x27;t at all weird; it&#x27;s a basic result of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<p>There are two wrinkles to this case:<p>First, the court ordered that Thuen be served with the demand for his computer without prior notice. According to the order, this is something that the court can do in extreme situations to prevent evidence from being spoiled. The reasoning the court used here is janky: Thuen claimed to be a &quot;hacker&quot;, and the court hung its assessment that he might be likely to blitz his hard drive on that.<p>Second, the court order <i>escrows</i> the hard drive image with the court, allowing Batelle&#x27;s forensic expert to image the drive but not examine that image; the court hasn&#x27;t yet determined what access Batelle will have to the image, but is instead taking steps to ensure that the image is available should it be needed.<p>Once again: hard drive images are not an unusual product of civil discovery. You do not have a &quot;4th amendment right&quot; to avoid civil discovery.<p>The &quot;hacker&quot; thing is facially ridiculous. But contra Digital Bond&#x27;s claim, &quot;hacker&quot; didn&#x27;t enable the hard drive imaging to occur; that was going to occur during discovery no matter what. Instead, &quot;hacker&quot; changed the prior notification procedure used to obtain the image.",1382491847

6596077,comment,6595329,6595329,41,0,lambda,,,"If anyone&#x27;s interested, I found the appeals court ruling finding him not guilty of violating federal law, and leading to his release, on PACER, uploaded to the Internet Archive so you can access it without a paywall via RECAP:<p><a href=""https://ia700209.us.archive.org/9/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.358303/gov.uscourts.nysd.358303.165.0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ia700209.us.archive.org/9/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.35...</a><p>The basic argument hinges on the three counts, related to three laws he was alleged to have broken: the Economic Espionage Act, the National Stolen Property Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse act. The third charge was dismissed by the district court because it rested on the fact that he had either accessed systems he was not authorized to or exceeded authorized access. However, he was authorized to access the source code in question, and what he did with it afterwards has no bearing on whether he exceeded his authorization, so it doesn&#x27;t fall under the CFAA.<p>The district court did convict him on the first two counts, but the Appeals Court reversed. Their argument is that the National Stolen Property Act doesn&#x27;t apply because it applies only to actual physical goods, not mere intangible ideas. Had he photocopied the source and walked out with it, or loaded it onto a thumb drive at the office and taken that with him, it would have counted as stealing a physical good, but merely uploading it to a server and downloading it onto a thumb drive later does not count.<p>The court further argues that he did not violate the Economic Espionage Act because the clause in question he was prosecuted under specifically requires that the &quot;trade secret ... is related to or included in a product that is produced for or placed in interstate or foreign commerce&quot;. Since Goldman Sachs&#x27; HFT trading system entirely proprietary and internal and not produced for or placed in interstate commerce, that particular law does not apply. Apparently Congress specifically intended this restriction, because earlier drafts of the statute had broader language that merely included &quot;proprietary economic information having a value of not less than $100,000&quot;. The fact that Goldman Sachs uses the product for interstate commerce is not compelling, it had to itself be produced for or placed in interstate commerce.<p>That last part is interesting. It implies that if you run proprietary, internal code that is not sold or intended to be sold in the future, you appear to lose federal criminal trade secret protections. It&#x27;s interesting that they tried to prosecute him on theft, trade secret infringement, and exceeding authorized access, but not copyright infringement. From my reading even unpublished work is subject to copyright.<p>Neither the original conviction nor the appeals court opinion ever addressed the copyright issue. In order for him to have stolen something, it would have had to be something of value; so why wasn&#x27;t he further prosecuted for copyright violation? From the documents I read (not all are available on PACER), the copyright question never even came up.<p>More documents from the case:<p>Motion to dismiss the original case in district court: <a href=""https://ia600209.us.archive.org/9/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.358303/gov.uscourts.nysd.358303.46.0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ia600209.us.archive.org/9/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.35...</a><p>Government&#x27;s response to the motion:

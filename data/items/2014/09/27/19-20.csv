8378014,comment,8377924,8377924,1,0,MCRed,,,"I think this depends a lot on the country and how much economic opportunity there is.  In some countries- like china in the past, for instance- you couldn&#x27;t start a business without favor from political elites.<p>If you live in the USA, made $10 an hour (just a proxy for &quot;minimum wage&quot;), you net about $18,000 after taxes, or $1473 a month.  IF you can find a room to rent for $400 a month and spend $300 a month on food etc, that leaves you about $750 a month to save.  That&#x27;s $9,000 a year or $153,000 over 17 years (the time it takes to go from 18 years old to 35 years old.)<p>That&#x27;s assuming no growth in your income or returns on your savings over that period.<p>What&#x27;s worked well for me personally is, whatever my income, I&#x27;ve tried to live like I had half of that income.<p>This is easy in some places, harder in others. Impossible in New York City (I think.)<p>This is also why I think that Remote work is a huge opportunity-- people could live in cheap places while earning an income from companies in expensive places with high value businesses.<p>EG: Programmers moving to Butte Montana and working for Bay Area Startups.",1411847998

8378012,comment,8376041,8376041,2,0,eliteraspberrie,,,"This general case of this method is sometimes called Lagrangian interpolation. As the article describes, there is one caveat with using these formulas: you can only decrease the step size so much before it backfires.<p>Because you are dividing by <i>h</i>, to decrease it from, say 1e-6, to 1e-8 introduces more error into the result than it removes. (Floating-point division with a numerator and denominator that have a big difference in magnitude is a problem.)<p>The example problem in the article just happened to be well conditioned because the sine and cosine, and their derivatives, are bound on [-1, 1], but most problems won&#x27;t be and the complex step method won&#x27;t help much then either.<p>To get better accuracy, rather than decrease the step size, you should use a higher-order formula. The three and five-point formulas are common. The <i>Handbook of Mathematical Functions</i> (Abramowitz & Stegun) has a table of coefficients for differentiation formulas up to the sixth order (Table 25.2): <a href=""http://imgur.com/eRl8w8h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/eRl8w8h</a><p>For fun, derive the 8-point formulas.",1411847955

There is simply no evidence of Ebola having been transmitted from an animal to a human being in West Africa or Central Africa for the 40 years the virus has been known, yet the media runs on and on about &#x27;bush meat&#x27; (which is a derogatory term for meat obtained by hunting or trapping), deforestation and other nonsensical theories about how Ebola emerged there.<p>Coming to the term &#x27;bush meat&#x27; when a Westerner hunts deer, ducks or grouse is it called &#x27;bush meat&#x27;? This only shows the kind of snide, racist, innuendo towards Africa and really hints an agenda to manufacture an unsubstantiated source of Ebola in the mind of uninformed Westerners.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t science be based on hard evidence rather than speculation? Ebola so far has been transmitted from human to human, meaning that a human must be the original source of Ebola. This is what science is supposed to mean, based on facts and evidence. So it raises the question who is patient zero, and how and where did they get and infected?<p>Prior to any outbreak the only places where Ebola can be found is in drug manufacturers and other biological laboratories, so why the surprise at conspiracy theories?<p>Then again there comes another question? Why Africa?<p>The amount of unexplored Amazonian rainforest is way larger than that in West Africa, why haven&#x27;t any Ebola style outbreaks occurred there, or in areas like Indonesia, New Guinea and Malaysia?<p>Claims which cause people to avoid sources of treatment are not helpful in these circumstances, but with so called foreign assistance being the source of cholera in Haiti, which should anyone be surprised at conspiracy theories?",1411845434

That being the case: with investors, you can plausibly hope to end up with somewhere between 20-50% of the company.<p>Say that as a single-founder company, in the unlikely event that you manage to raise not only a seed rounds but an institutional A round, you end up holding 40% of the company by the time it sells.<p>Now look at what happens if you have two equal co-founders: 13%, squarely in Altman country.<p>Being irritated about this is pointless. At each dilutive step --- dividing the pie between cofounders, allocating options to employees, buying a pile of money from seed investors, buying a bigger pile of money from VCs --- you were given a judgement call: &quot;will the amount of equity I end up, converted to dollars, be <i>higher</i> or <i>lower</i> if I give up equity now?&quot; If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, you say &quot;no&quot;.<p>Often the answer is &quot;yes&quot;. For instance: &quot;will I make more money in the long run if I cut my stake <i>in half</i> by bringing on an equal cofounder?&quot; If you&#x27;re being careful, and you don&#x27;t have a cofounder already, probably yes. Looking at your percentage is not helpful. Think of it this way: prior to having a cofounder, all your energy and skill is generating ${X} amount of value. If you select a cofounder carefully, you can end up generating <i>more than ${2X}</i>: not only is there <i>a whole other founder</i> working on the problem, but their skills complement yours. Also you can get the stomach flu for a week and not leave the company rudderless.<p>The percentage you&#x27;re left with is a barometer, but it&#x27;s a little like the spot cost of a share of stock: you need more context to actually evaluate it. Having 90% of it can be a <i>bad sign</i>: it means you&#x27;re keeping a lot of your value in the bank, rather than deploying it to accelerate your business.<p>You say you&#x27;re building a company positioned for &quot;hyper growth&quot;. I&#x27;d suggest you double-check that assumption. Implied in the strategy of &quot;hyper-growth&quot; is &quot;fast go-to-market&quot;. That costs money. Money costs equity. My sense is that a lot of people who believe they&#x27;re in a shoot- the- moon startup are just fine with 10%; 10% of ${BIG NUMBER} is ${BIG NUMBER}. If you&#x27;re thinking about what 10% of ${MODEST NUMBER} is, you&#x27;re not thinking about &quot;hyper growth&quot;. Which is fine! I think &quot;hyper growth&quot; is a bad strategy for most founders.<p>You can keep 100% of the company if you go it alone, don&#x27;t take on investors, and pay nosebleed market salaries for all your employees.

For example, a <i>lot</i> of Cocoa these days relies on dictionaries and/or stringly-typed identifiers:  KVC, KVO, Bindings, Archiving, CoreImage attributes, CoreData&#x27;s interface to the database etc, etc.  Autolayout also uses a separate string-based language.<p>There are a lot of problems with this approach, not the least of which are performance, code bloat and lack of any kind of compile-time checking.<p>Polymorphic Identifiers[1] in Objective-Smalltalk[2] are an attempt at addressing these issues (and others).  The paper shows why you actually need a small amount of language support to successfully build libraries that address these issues.<p>I wish I could complain about how Swift&#x27;s approach to these issues is so much inferior to mine (grin), but there just isn&#x27;t anything at all.  If anything, support for solving these sorts of problems is thinner than in Objective-C.  Yikes!<p>Another issue is the large-scale structure of applications...their architecture:  target/action, delegates, bindings (again), notifications, view-controller segues etc.  are all architectural connectors, and a large part of what makes Cocoa so powerful.  However, these types of connections (-> configurations) can only be described in ad-hoc ways in code, or in a different ad-hoc way in IB.  Various inspectors of a GUI builder are not really the proper place to describe the overall architecture of your program.<p>There have been many systems/languages for describing such high-level architectures, for example ArchJava or ACME.  In Swift?  Crickets.<p>When direct language support for a feature is not present, dynamic messaging has been a great way of making library features available as if they were built-in language features.  Swift makes this harder or downright impossible.<p>> Swift wasn&#x27;t designed to make better libraries and tools possible<p>Yep.  In fact, it&#x27;s arguably a step back even compared to Objective-C.  Which is sad.<p>> but rather to work well with the ones we already have.<p>Except that it doesn&#x27;t really work all that well with existing ones either.

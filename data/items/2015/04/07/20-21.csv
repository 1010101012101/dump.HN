9337120,comment,9335607,9336127,0,0,curun1r,,,"Sometimes timing is everything. The article mentioned that the crime was committed near the end of a violent period in that region and the public was giving politicians the message that they needed to crack down on crime. So what would have normally been a crime that merited a decade or so of prison time received a near-life sentence. He was essentially being punished for the actions of the criminals that came before him.<p>It reminds me a bit of something that happened to the brother of a former colleague of mine. He was an animal rights activist that allegedly, in protest, set off a bomb at an animal testing facility. The bomb went off at a time when no one was there. If he&#x27;d done it a few years earlier, it wouldn&#x27;t have received much attention. But it happened shortly after 9/11 and the sentiment in the country was to stop terrorism at all costs. And so he&#x27;s been on the FBI&#x27;s most wanted list ever since. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, setting off bombs is a serious matter, but I have a hard time believing that a stupid juvenile prank that only resulted in property damage puts someone in the top 10 most dangerous people the FBI could be pursuing.<p>Timing can be a bitch and the justice that someone receives is often more about the vengeance that society is yearning for rather than what the offender deserves.",1428440383

9337114,comment,9335441,9335441,0,0,east2west,,,"I am trying to get into distributed computing so this article is particularly interesting to me. I may be mistaken so please excuse my naivety if my points are off marks. I thought MPI was mainly geared towards communication-heavy tasks where the underlying network is specialized, for example infiniband or bus between CPUs. One use of MPI is to manage distributed memory tasks between different physical CPUs while threads run on multiple cores of same CPU. Spark, I believe, doesn&#x27;t handle cases like this well because JVM hides low level details. I have read papers that propose to layer MPI over RDMA rather than expose a flat memory model, which came as a surprise to me but it shows the flexibility of MPI. One thing unclear to me what performance we can expect from MPI when we use commodity network gears, and how it compares to Spark. The article is absolutely correct MPI leaves robustness to user and that is today an oversight.<p>Modern Hadoop ecosystem is designed for different workload from MPI&#x27;s. It emphasizes co-localizing date and computation, seamless robustness,and trades off raw power for simple programmingmodels. MapReduce turns out too simple, so Spark implements graph execution, which is nothing new to HPC. As far I know Spark&#x27;s authors don&#x27;t believe it is ready for distributed numerical linear algebra yet. But a counterpoint is that I am seeing machine learning libraries using Spark, so perhaps things are improving.<p>One thing I have learnt today is that MPI isn&#x27;t gaining popularity. I just have a hard time picturing a JVM language in overall control in HPC where precise control of memory is paramount to performance.",1428440341

They tend to paint the overall industry with a very broad brush, and are, in my experience, often caricatures (this one certainly isn&#x27;t the worst). This article is based mostly on anonymous anecdotes and is peppered with weasel words, for example: &quot;More broadly, some economists say...&quot; &quot;Workers with children say...&quot; The one piece of data I saw, the number of women in the workforce, has a truncated Y scale.<p>I&#x27;ve lived and worked in Silicon Valley at tech companies for the last 17 years at many small and large high tech companies, including Apple. My wife also has been working in tech for longer than that, and she enjoys it. I have two young children. When I read these articles, I feel like I&#x27;m reading about another universe, as it is so vastly different than my experience.  Of course, I can only offer my own anecdotes in response, but here are a few of mine:<p>- My wife interviewed at a small startup when she was pregnant with our first son. During the interviews, she informed them she was pregnant and wasn&#x27;t sure how much time she wanted to take off after the baby was born.  They were totally cool about it and said they&#x27;d be happy to have her for as long as they could. She ended up working there and loved it.<p>- I&#x27;m 40 years old. The people who work with me are a mix of ages.  I&#x27;ve rarely been the oldest, and I certainly don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m outnumbered by people much younger than me. I&#x27;ve interviewed at a number of companies with young founders, and never felt discriminated against. I still get pinged by plenty of recruiters, so I&#x27;m not seeing the ageism that is supposedly so rampant here. I have plenty of friends and acquaintances who are close to my age, and I&#x27;m not hearing these complaints from them either.<p>Honestly, I think this is sloppy journalism, designed to provoke an emotional reaction. I don&#x27;t want to deny the very real problems in this industry that we should be working on, but I don&#x27;t think articles like this are helping. If anything, they are scaring women and minorities away from the industry and making the diversity problem worse.",1428439710

I think there is enough controversy over standardized testing to be able to at least say that solely relying on such methods, especially in a high-stress situation or even due to cultural differences, might come with some drawbacks and not be an accurate indicator for all candidates.<p>Lest I forget, Google is a business, and if such tools are what help Google find the candidates it wants, then so be it.  It might also be an indicator to candidates about what kind of organization Google is.  As a business, the organization will usually prioritize its desires/needs/benefits over those of the candidate - it&#x27;s not a charity, and I get that.  All I am saying is, it may just be that they are excluding certain diversity or individuals unnecessarily without realizing it.  Perhaps that is the motivation behind the reported change in attitude towards such types of questions, I&#x27;m not sure.<p>It may or may not be that coding skills were relevant to the specific position. That said, in my experience, product management in software companies in particular is not stovepiped in such a way that you need not have any experience in coding.  In fact, I think that some of the best product managers in such companies have coding experience, business experience, hardware/software/etc., and/or cross-disciplinary skill-sets.  Perhaps such strong candidates don&#x27;t fit the standard model, I&#x27;m not sure.",1428439185

They only tell people &#x27;what exists&#x27; in the world, just as it is. As it happens, there is a specific, and mandatory process which must be undergone in order to obtain enlightenment. You cannot gain enlightenment through the variety of spiritual practices promulgated by modern religions. I know this because none of them make the practitioner undergo that mandatory process. Additionally, there are no examples in the entirety of human history of people who have gained enlightenment through such practices.<p>Philosophies? I&#x27;d like you to show me any religions which have any true philosophy in them. Philosophy means the pursuit and revelation of what exists in the world. What religion can accurately reveal what exists in the world? You&#x27;ve only got to find one example of a religion which has &#x27;truth&#x27; in it. In any case, no one can learn a precise &#x27;truth&#x27; from a religion, because truths can only be seen and verified through specific problems. As a matter of fact, every religion only hinders you from opening your eyes to the reality of the religion. I think it will be important for you to understand that. This world already contains all the teachings that we need. Every truth is in the world. So what reason do religions have to exist? There&#x27;s an important reason why the true teachers in human history did not want to start any religions. Some of them were killed by religious people for telling the truth about religions.<p>Practices? Those can be right or wrong, and to practice anything is not by any means limited to religious people. In that case, do you need to be part of a religion to perform whatever practice you refer to? If not, then it is not the religion which contributes the benefit of the practice. If so, then what practice are you referring to? If you don&#x27;t want to have your knowledge verified, and you only are willing to make abstract claims, then it is not right to try to suggest your opinion to others.

Every voicemail system needs the option to press zero. Escape valves may take the form of appeals processes, or higher-level administrators who are empowered to make exceptions to the rules, or evolved cultural practices within an organization. Sometimes they might consist of nothing more than individual clerks who have the freedom to fix dumb results by breaking the rules. In some cases this is perceived as a failure—after all, making an exception to a rule in order to treat an individual fairly diminishes the qualities of predictability and control that make a bureaucratic machine so valuable to those at the top.

9336899,comment,9334782,9334782,0,0,pdabbadabba,,,"> Suddenly the misery of allergies took on a new look. Allergies weren’t the body going haywire; they were the body’s strategy for getting rid of the allergens.<p>Well of course. I&#x27;m just a layman when it comes to allergies, but I thought it was well understood that allergies were the body&#x27;s inflammatory reaction to an allergen, i.e., an attempt to eliminate (or otherwise neutralize) the allergen. The problem is that, according to the conventional wisdom, the body&#x27;s reaction to allergen is <i>mistaken</i>. Presumably the body is attempting to target and eliminate something that is actually harmful, but it winds up responding to something harmless, or by triggering a response so severe that it does more harm than good. That&#x27;s, broadly speaking, the difference between an allergen and a pathogen/poison. A poison/pathogen will actually harm you if it is not eliminated. An allergen will not (or, at least, not in proportion to the severity of the reaction. But I don&#x27;t see why the observation above has anything to say about the real question, which is why does the body sometimes mistakes one for the other, and freaks out in the presence of harmless substances?",1428438145

9336895,comment,9334316,9334316,0,0,simonster,,,"One problem is that being a PI no longer seems to mean what it used to. For a PI, productivity is writing grants and getting other smart people to do research and write papers. While it may vary from field to field, I&#x27;ve worked for several PIs who have fantastic funding and are great at marketing their research, but don&#x27;t have the knowledge to reproduce their own labs&#x27; experiments. My impression is that, for many successful scientists, the career arc goes something like:<p>- Get really good at doing science as a graduate student and postdoc.<p>- Become a junior PI, spend most of your time selling your science, and train your graduate students and postdocs for a few years. You need to keep up with the literature to know what to do next, but you rarely have time to perform experiments yourself.<p>- Become a senior PI. Now your lab is established, and you can hire half a dozen knowledgeable postdocs to teach the others in your lab. As your field advances, you need to keep up enough to sell the discoveries your lab has made to grant review panels, but you don&#x27;t actually have to know how to do the science. That&#x27;s for those below you.<p>There are some clear exceptions. Some PIs really do know how to do everything. Some PIs even keep running experiments while also writing grants and running a lab, although that&#x27;s not necessarily an easy task. But for most PIs, the arc above seems to be the way it goes. You take the brightest, most talented scientists, and once they reach they become really knowledgeable, you turn them into professional grantwriters.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is, but I feel like there has to be a better way. To start, maybe we should think about limiting lab size, so that your lab seeks to maximize the productivity per employed scientist rather than the total amount of funding that you can obtain. Without so much pressure to accumulate funds to grow their labs, perhaps PIs could spend less time writing grants and more time running labs. Also, with smaller labs you can afford to hire more PIs and give a career path to more of the postdocs that you are &quot;training.&quot;",1428438119

On the other hand, the reason I posted is that even where such comments are well-intentioned, they can often signal a discounting of the female colleague&#x27;s other abilities.<p>I&#x27;ve become more sensitive to this since an experience a couple of years on a film I was working on. Film sets are broadly gender-neutral. sure, there are more female make-up artists and male grips and camera operators, but those tend to be reflective of cultural and physical differences rather than institutionalized (more women have experience of dealing with makeup from an early age, it&#x27;s easier for men to wrangle heavy lighting equipment or weighty 35mm cameras). I&#x27;ve met many people of the opposite gender to the one that might be expected, and the general attitude is &#x27;if you know what you&#x27;re doing it doesn&#x27;t matter who you are.&#x27; I&#x27;ve never heard anyone express the idea that women can&#x27;t be cinematographers, or this or that.<p>However, on this project, we had an actress who was cast in a sort of <i>femme fatale</i> role, and her best known credit was an appearance in a highly sexualized context on a cable TV series. And she was very, very hot - she&#x27;s appeared as a model in a variety of men&#x27;s magazines (the sort where they show hot women in expensive bikinis or underwear rather than actual nudity). To my surprise, a ton of people, including some other women, projected all their stereotypes of the &#x27;bimbo&#x27; image on this actress and though everyone was formally polite (as far as I could tell) She was discussed int he abstract as nothing more than a hot body, along with general critiques of her intellect, acting ability and so on.<p>I had little contact with her during the shoot (short schedule + working as a department head = constantly busy), and my impression at the time was that she was perfectly smart but very stressed, which I put down to the working atmosphere that was created around her (and which was different on days when she wasn&#x27;t on set - you get a feel for these things). The final straw was on the last evening, when there was a fight/action scene in which she was involved. As soon as she showed up, the lead actor just stood up and explained how it should all go down and how he would do all the work etc.<p>I didn&#x27;t blow a gasket about it because we had a limited amount of time, although I remonstrated with the producers and director about it, but they didn&#x27;t want to slow things down. I wasn&#x27;t remonstrating to be noble, but because the actress had black belts in more than one martial art, had studied in China, and had numerous credits as a fight coordinator, far more experience in this specialization than anyone else on the set. She also had a degree <i>cum laude</i> from a prestigious university in a challenging subject and a bunch of other accomplishments, and yet most of the cast and crew were treating her as little better than a mannequin.<p>tl;dr many of the original comments might have a positive intent, but unfortunately it&#x27;s all to easy to be positively dismissive of someone&#x27;s actual abilities without really intending to.",1428436926

While Objective-C is based on Smalltalk, Smalltalk was far easier to use, however lots of people use Objective-C.  No one uses Smalltalk.<p>How could it have been different?

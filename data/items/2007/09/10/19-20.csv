The time to leave is now.  I doesn't get cheaper, easier, or less legally entangling, later on.<p>Hire slow and fire fast applies to co-founders as well as employees.  More, even.  An employee can drain a lot of value from a company, but a co-founder can destroy it single-handedly.",1189452451
52910,comment,52412,52423,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The problem with a day job isn't really the time it takes up, it's what it does to the remaining time.  Yeah, you've in theory got 30-35 hours a week of ""free"" time.  However, it's likely broken up into an hour before work, a couple hours after work, and 10 hrs/day on weekends.  And your full attention won't be on your startup during those blocks, because you'll be worrying about having to get to work or exhausted from having come home from work.<p>I've found that nearly all my completed projects have required the ability to say ""Fuck it"" to all my other commitments and just concentrate on them.  My first project for FictionAlley was done during summer vacation.  The big rewrite of FictionAlley lingered for 3 years while I kept putting it off for college coursework, and only got finished because I put in a 4-month gap between graduating and getting a job.  Scrutiny was done instead of studying for my physics final exam, which I ended up flunking anyways.  My most successful project at work involved blowing off all my boss's requests for busywork, which made him pretty mad at me until he saw the result.  Once I had to start paying attention to his busywork again, my productivity dropped way off.",1189452439

[insert standard boilerplate here about ideas being worth nothing without execution]<p>consumers like choice and having core differences in values between two competing products helps define the market better and broader.  if you are going to compete head to head with a co-founder i am sure you are going to have different core values to derive as a niche.  but, even though you are competing, you will be sharing the burden of advertising and developing your market.  Java, helped sell .Net; friendster, helped sell MySpace and Facebook; hotmail, helped sell gmail, etc.... competition is good, and a market without any might not be much of a market at all.  do not fear the genre, find ways to embrace it.  <p>you might find that you can form two separate businesses that share an initial code base and your partner might go for it if he feels you are driving the company in the wrong direction too.",1189451859

Angels are a lot bolder than VCs.  <p>The big difference between Silicon Valley and Boston in my experience is that the valley has more and much bolder angels. The VCs in the two places are similar.  Boston VCs have a bit less testosterone than valley VCs, but it's not a huge difference.  The real difference is the angels.  And unfortunately for Boston, angels are the deciding factor in how big a tech hub a city becomes.",1189451303

Most of the time reddit slows down, it's db related, but so far there has always been a way to work through it. That being said, I feel we have to spend far too much time worrying about the database, and that's probably the situation with any relational db.<p>Presently, we have a db master that replicated to one machine, and that second machine replicates to a couple others. Most of the reddit queries are handled by the master and the first slave. The other slaves are used for backups and slow queries (e.g. stats and recommendations).<p>Replication and query load-balancing helped out a lot with the database load, but it introduced a new host of problems. Replication lag, in particular. This occurs when a db write is committed to the master, but the next read hits a slave before the write has propagated. """,1189450852

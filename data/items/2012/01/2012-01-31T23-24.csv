In the second edition, which is what I happen to have, it's column 9 (because the old column 4 got split into two) and the code is in a pseudocode that's much more like C with the semicolons deleted than like any version of BASIC.<p>I wasn't quite right to say that the inner loop is very tight; rather, the code assumes a particular size of array and unrolls the loop completely. But, indeed, the size doesn't need to be a power of 2.<p>Here's the (pseudo)code, in case anyone cares. It's for an array of size 1000. I've changed a variable name from ""l"" to ""m"" because of the usual l1I| thing. I've removed a couple of helpful comments because anyone who cares enough to bother reading them will probably have more fun figuring everything out on their own. I've also elided some obvious repetitive code and formatted it slightly differently from Bentley. Any errors in the code were probably introduced by me.<p><pre><code>  m = -1
  if (x[  511] < t) m = 1000-512
  if (x[m+256] < t) m += 256
  if (x[m+128] < t) m += 128
  /* ... */
  if (x[m+  2] < t) m +=   2
  if (x[m+  1] < t) m +=   1
  p = m+1
  if (p>1000 || x[p]!=t) p = -1 /* i.e., not found */
</code></pre>
Bentley says this is ""not for the faint of heart"". I agree, but I do think it's lovely. Though personally I'd be inclined to use a value of m offset by 1 from what Bentley does (initialize to 0, look up m+255, m+127, etc.) and save a line of code and a couple of cycles.",1328054043

Since inserting nil into a table just deletes that key of the table, the use site might be several steps away from the typo.<p>Other than that, I agree with the other posters here. It's an impressively lightweight and elegant language.

The orders vary in strictness, with GAE requiring that you purify yourself of all worldly design habits before writing your app, Azure insisting you renounce the demon Unix, and Heroku somewhat more welcoming to the fallen.

Feedback is appreciated:<p>Regarding digital locks, in an earlier version of the bill called C-60, they had the completely reasonable position that circumventing digital locks would only infringe if the circumvention was done to further an infringing act. If you broke the lock to exercise your fair dealing rights, that would not be infringement.<p>The WIPO lawyers argued that wasn't the intention of the Internet treaties we signed, but I think that's bullshit. A marketing campaign after the fact about the possible intention of the law doesn't matter; only what's written and how it would be reasonably interpreted to achieve its stated aims.<p>The WIPO treaties explicitly allow for fair dealing and fair use restrictions on the rights granted to copyright holders. Further, they only demand that digital locks are protected to enforce rights of the copyright holders.<p>However, clearly the rights of the copyright holders are limited by the fair dealing provisions (1), and therefore the digital locks don't need to be enforced where they prevent non-infringing uses.<p>(1) If you don't get this, it's important to remember that rights and freedoms are never unlimited. We have freedom of expression in Canada, but that is reasonably limited when that expression causes harm to society, such as yelling ""Fire!"" in a crowded theatre or hate speech or even reporting election results early. The full right isn't the one paragraph that grants ""freedom of expression"" in the Charter, but that paragraph limited by the reasonable restrictions around it.<p>Similarly, copyrights are not the simple paragraph descriptions like ""right to control copies"", but the full right as limited by fair dealing.<p>Therefore, when WIPO only asks for enforcement of digital locks that protect the rights of copyright holders, that requirement is limited by fair dealing.",1328051136

Between the hardware and the software, I have spent thousands of dollars on my ability to edit in FCP. I have never dedicated myself to ""bashing FCP anywhere it's talked about"".<p>@nirvana: and you can't even respond honestly to people's points.<p>Reality: I can respond honestly, point by point, with this response being a case in point.<p>@nirvana: Not once in my life have I ever bashed an Avid product or Premiere, and I certainly don't jump into threads where they're discussed to do so, calling people ""asshole"", ""nitwit"", ""moron"", ""dick"", etc.<p>Reality: You introduced yourself to this conversation by denigrating the professional status of professional editors and post-producers, accused them of performing their jobs mindlessly, stated that they were simply luddites hostile to change, and that their inability to adapt to FCP X was a function of laziness, and NOT with any deficiencies in the product itself. In other words, you launched an unprovoked  wave of personal attacks that had little bearing on the technical and business issues that have been central to the whole FCP X fiasco.<p>You were behaving like an asshole. And then you got upset when called out for behaving like an asshole. That's a quintessential dick move.<p>@nirvana: There exists a product called ""7toX"" that converts projects from FCP 7 to FCP X. It does the XML conversion.<p>Reality: Uncontested, but irrelevant. The concern with XML is not with the conversion of old projects to the new format  (though that's certainly an issue). The concern is that a lack of native support means that FCP X cannot work seamlessly with industry standard software like ProTools, Maya, and so on. Given that a core function of an editor is compiling elements built in a variety of different systems, the inability to talk to those systems is a very big deal. Indeed, when people say ""this is not a professional product"" this is precisely what they mean; unlike its predecessor, it is fundamentally incompatible with the professional environments it's expected to manage.<p>@nirvana: Making convertibility easy is the whole purpose of using XML in the first place.<p>Reality: And that's why removing native support for XML is like going into an air traffic control tower and smashing the radios. How do you not understand this?<p>@nirvana: But if that doesn't work for you, then you don't have to transition to FCPX at all.<p>Reality: No one has to transition to FCP X, but they do have to transition. As noted elsewhere, ending sales of FCP 7 means that existing pipelines are frozen. No additional seats can be lawfully added. Firms wanting to grow legally will need to switch to a platform that will accomodate this growth. This is a non-trivial expense. Moreover, the announcement came with zero warning, which was ham-fisted in the extreme.<p>It is absolutely idiotic to say (as you did) that the ""outcry"" isn't coming from people faced with this unexpected and unnecessary cost, and that it's actually astroturf coming from Apple's competitors. In reality, it is coming from people who no longer have a clear roadmap from a primary vendor, can no longer plan their own operations accordingly, who were shocked by the ineptitude of the FCP X rollout, and who now have to assume the heavy cost of transitioning away from a suddenly untrustworthy partner.<p>@nirvana: So, what are you complaining about?<p>Reality: There is no question about what I, and many many others are complaining about. Only idiots who can't be bothered to read what they actually have to say (including, it seems, some within Apple itself).<p>@nirvana: A product you don't use doesn't have a feature you want, and so you're going to run around calling people names for the crime of liking that product?<p>Reality: See above. But just to reiterate, I use FCP X and I like it a lot. I don't think liking it is a crime. I never said anything that would suggest otherwise. Indeed, you'd have to be an idiot to respond to what I said with an assumption like this.",1328051030

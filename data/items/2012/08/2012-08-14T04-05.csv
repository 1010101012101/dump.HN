Ok. Sure. He is right that modelling is probably what ""people who don't get math"" struggle the most with.<p>But saying that math is just ""computational stuff, turn the crank, let the computer do it"" kind of thing is ludicrous. You can use mathematics as a blackbox model to do cool demos and stuff, but at some point you //have// to open the box and see how it is done.<p>It just happens that the standard math curriculum (numbers, functions, sin, cos, etc.) is a very good mix of conceptual complexity and computational complexity that can all be understood with pen and paper. You won't need to trust anyone, the proof is right there on the sheet. Anyone trying to take that understand in order to replace with with a SolveEquation[.] is not on the right side of intellectualism. Demos yes, but view source (is there view source for Mathematica functions?) and explain source are //sine qua non// for deep knowledge.",1344920124

In the (post) modern era there seems to be much noise about faith (Christianity in particular) and science being irreconcilable.<p>What little I do know about many founders of the major fields of science seems to indicate that the founding men and women saw no such dichotomy.  Or at the least were willing to struggle with the questions rather than throw the entire matter out as ""unscientific.""<p>Lord Kelvin and Michael Faraday seem to have both Christians and creationists.  Newton was a Christian and claimed that ""all my discoveries have been made in answer to prayer.""  Joule (the unit's namesake) was at least a theist.  Then we have Louis Pasteur, Christopher Columbus, George Washington Carver, Samuel Morse, and Blaise Pascal - each ""men of faith.""<p>Not that the above list should be taken as an argument by authority for faith.  Certainly not.  However, it does leave me wondering how these great thinkers saw the world so differently.",1344919676

Look through at the 100 submissions about App.net per day, there are so many different speculations, even contradictory ones, but not a lot of information coming out.<p>There's a group that thinks App.net is not the point, they think App.net is somehow the social network backbone or ""social-network-as-a-service"" or something. But that doesn't make a lot of sense to me because App.net is charging. So if you start you're little niche social network ""MechanicWorld,"" which seems like back-to-the-future but ok, are the users paying MechanicWorld or App.net (how would they know App.net exists?). Is MechanicWorld going to offer free signup, provide an advertising based business model, and simply subsidize the free user accounts?

That's a pretty strange market, but this one is a bit of a strawman, I've only heard it a bit and I don't think Dalton has intention of this.<p>I think it is still very vague what it is and how it will work.

Twitter has people believing they are responsible for the Arab Spring (yeah right) -- I don't know how App.net is going to get this kind of press.<p>And the other thing, App.net, really?

4379422,comment,4376803,4376803,1,0,JamesLeonis,,,"My grandfather sends me those political chain emails asking if they have any validity. He's pretty skeptical and deletes the majority of these, but every now and again he wants more information. That's where I come in. Last night I responded to one where the author attacked his opponent's credibility without any cited sources, for or against. I wrote him a long response about the need for sources, as well as the need to check the source's credibility.<p>What this article points out is how the news media is very hungry for new stories, and their need to publish as soon as possible. This means unverified information passes through the journalistic filter. This also points out, like the emails above, that people will generally fall for confirmation bias in many cases. Even HN has bouts of the echo chamber. It's really hard to counter, even when you are actively guarding against it.<p>Manual critical thinking and checking sources <i>all the time</i> is very mentally draining. I would bet that most to all of us have some form of automatic first-pass mental filter that immediately questions ""facts"" contained in email chain letters, or the latest fad technology if it has too many buzzwords, or Facebook posts. That is a shortcut we've developed so we don't have to manually think about every bit of information that comes across our desks. It goes immediately to the mental round file.<p>Unfortunately, there are people out there that do not have this filter. Maybe they haven't mentally trained to look for these kinds of problems. Maybe they were referred to the story by a trusted source, like a good friend or a prominent publication. Maybe the information fell precisely into their particular confirmation bias that it bypassed their skepticism. Political advertising <i>thrives</i> on this problem. Unscrupulous con men thrive off this problem.<p>But it happens to us all the time. I fall for it all the time, even though I try to find the ""real"" facts and am generally skeptical of most things. Thus it doesn't surprise me that people fell for the screw hoax, because Apple is traditionally very secretive and has a history of locking out DIYers. That screw fit Apple's MO to a T, and thus likely slipped through many of the internet bullshit filters and went viral. It happens. It will happen again.<p>The best we can do is try our best to root out false information, and accept that we will be fooled from time to time.",1344918895

Unfortunately, the PCI DSS is somewhat subjective and enforced inconsistently, so it's difficult to definitively answer what's required for PCI compliance for a certain type of payments integration.<p>Even for merchants that use third-party hosted payment forms, it's still common to need to complete SAQ A (a short self-assessment questionnaire) and have quarterly network scans. For example, with PayPal[1]: ""Our hosted solution takes a lot of the work out of meeting these standards. The only remaining requirements are a Security Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and Quarterly Security Scans.""<p>According to MasterCard[2]: ""All merchants that store, process, or transmit cardholder data must be PCI compliant."" It's subjective whether using Stripe.js could be considered transmitting cardholder data.<p>Visa[3] holds Acquirers responsible for ensuring their merchants are PCI compliant. Requirements vary depending on processing volume: ""In addition to adhering to the PCI DSS, compliance validation is required for Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 merchants, and may be required for Level 4 merchants."" Notice that for Level 4 merchants, validation only <i>may</i> be required, although those merchants should still be adhering to the PCI DSS.<p>Stripe has several PCI requirements in their terms of service[4], and their FAQ does seem to indicate[5] that merchants have some responsibility for PCI compliance.

He got it for $0, so that made him happy.<p>> Gates focuses on what is good for the users and not on M$ controlling the Switcher<p>He wanted to take advantage of the fact that his apps had very low memory footprints. Switcher was the way to do it. He had no need to control Switcher itself. The fact that he wanted the project done quickly to save money says to me he didn't really care about quality, which users obviously do. <p>

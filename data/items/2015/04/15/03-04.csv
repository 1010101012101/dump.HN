Of course it is not possible to determine what they are thinking exactly, but this is part of the problem.<p>Most people are so disconnected from animals.  You might have a pet or 2 in your lifetime -- some people never have pets.  Even if you have had pets in your life, then you might understand dogs or cats, but you don&#x27;t understand the daily lives of the millions of species of animals on the planet (I googled for the &quot;millions&quot; bit, but actually I don&#x27;t really know how many different animals there are).  And finally, even if you know dogs or cats really, really well, you tend to know them as pets and not in terms of the culture they might have if given free reign.<p>So we extrapolate greatly from our very limited understanding of what an animal thinks.  For the most part we don&#x27;t observe them for more than a few seconds at a time and have no way of understanding how they might express sadness or happiness.  In fact, last night I was subjected to watching &quot;Frozen&quot; (again) and I couldn&#x27;t help but notice how the reindeer acts like a dog.  Is it because dogs are more expressive in their emotions than reindeer?  Or is it because nobody in the target audience would have any reference point to understand the emotions of a reindeer?<p>I have kept fish in tanks before in my life and watched them enough to believe that I could discern when they were happy or sad or stressed or carefree.  There was once an unfortunate incident when a small fish had a mishap with the filtration equipment and I happened to witness it.  The rest of the fish seemed absolutely shocked for the rest of the day.  Were they traumatized by the event?  Were chemicals (or blood) released into the water by the killed fish that affected their attitude?  Was I injecting my own feelings into the fish.  These are things that I don&#x27;t, and for all intents and purposes, can&#x27;t know.<p>I don&#x27;t know one way or another, but it seems likely to me that animals think and feel in some way that is similar to humans.  It is more my lack of exposure to their forms of communication and culture that makes it difficult for me to understand and emphasize with their feelings.  At least, I think this is more likely than an animal&#x27;s brain and nervous system working in such a different way from a human&#x27;s that they do not have these kinds of feelings.<p>From that perspective, it seems reasonable to err on the side of caution and do your moral reasoning as if animals had at least some capacity for these ideas and feelings.",1429067168

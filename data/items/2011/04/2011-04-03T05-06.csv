2401945,comment,2401498,2401498,6,0,justatdotin,,,"hmmm, the entire article excludes the words 'weapons' and 'waste'.\nall nuclear reactors produce long lived radioactive wastes which are left for humanity to manage well beyond the forseeable future. Here in Australia, we've come up with a state-of-the-art answer to our own burden of nuclear waste (arising from 30 years of experimentation and research reactors) - we're building a road out to a remote desert location, building a shed and dumping the unwanted problem on the tribal lands of a disempowered, de-funded indigenous community. Real reassuring, huh?<p>As for weapons, although the old cold-war powers continue to slowly reduce the huge numbers of conventional nuclear weapons they hold, they're also building new ones. And at the same time as the total number of nuclear warheads in the world is slowly decreasing, the total number of actors holding those weapons is greater than ever, with the proliferation of nuclear materials and technologies spreading despite all rhetoric and pantomime surrounding the NPT. As Former US Vice President Al Gore said in 2006: ""For eight years in the White House, every weapons-proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program. And if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal ... then we'd have to put them in so many places we'd run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale.""<p>finally, to the question of renewables :\nI totally reject the repeated assertions that renewables can't provide scalable or baseload power. Here in sunny Australia, we're following the lead of nations like Spain and building a few large grid connected solar-thermal and solar-hybrid plants, that compare well with the capacities of old fossil and hydro plants. Already, large remote communities in my part of the country are powered entirely by solar concentrator arrays.<p>So I say, stick your nuclear power reactors where the sun doesn't shine.",1301810221

Only one of those is possible.""</i><p>No, both are possible, and in fact both are true.<p>Look at apartment listings - in any major city full of spam, obviously posting <i>far</i> more frequently than is allowed. I've tried flaggin these posts - but it looks like the flag threshold is proportionate to the category's traffic level. Which is to say, for something like apts/housing, <i>very</i> high. Makes sense on paper until you realize there aren't enough dedicated users policing to actually make the flags a working feature on these categories. So yes, shitty experience for browsers, chock full of spam.<p>Turn around, look at smaller categories where the flag threshold seems to become very low (say, anything outside the realm of selling/renting physical goods), and it becomes a terrible place to sell. Perfectly innocuous posts are flagged off for inexplicable reasons (believe me, I've sat through the flag-help posts and seen <i>plenty</i> of these), and incredibly common for competing advertisers to use the flag feature offensively against similar postings. So yes, too easy to flag and terrible place to sell.<p>You can insist all you like, and pretend that anyone who gets posts flagged is <i>obviously</i> doing something wrong - you'd be right there with the rest of flag-help after all, but that doesn't change the fact that the flag system is routinely abused and seriously compromises the credibility of CL. It's simultaneously too strict to filter to spam, and too lenient that it generates mass numbers of false positives. It's an utter failure of an abuse-detection scheme.<p>Craigslist is ripe for being disrupted - it's already happened in some categories, and there is a lot of ache in the market for the others. For me it's been relatively little loss - I've been using the craigslist-disruptor-equivalent to gigs/creative and it works great, much better than CL.",1301809757

According to my site's review on siteadvisor.com, other ""bad sites"" linked to Plimus, and therefore my site also must be bad. A lot of small software companies use and link to Plimus, and it turned out those bad sites were companies that sold PC monitoring software. I think it's unethical for companies to install monitoring software on employee computers, but that's a very tenuous relationship to flag my site as bad.

Why the fark CANT we come together over the singularly most important resource modern and future civilization needs, energy.<p>We humans are really lacking in the high-level critical thought area. For example, we have yet to formalize a civilizations hierarchy of needs. Much like the individual hierarchy of needs set forth by Maslow, all levels of biology have one.<p>Taking a look at civilizations then, what would be the hierarchy of needs that require nurture, protection, support etc...<p>I have come up with the following first attempt:<p>Progress<p>Organization<p>Wellbeing<p>Energy<p>Resources<p>Sustenance<p>First: a civilization needs sustainable methods of feeding itself which is not a net drain on the planet. (potentially combined with Resources)<p>Second: they need to be able to access, extract/harvest and refine appropriate Resources.<p>Third: they need to be able to produce and support the energy consumption requirements they have in a similar sustainable manner.<p>Fourth: They need to be able to provide for the wellbeing of the civilization through both proper physical protections as well as appropriate health care services that are not, themselves, a diseased burden on the energy, resources, or sustenance of the civilization.<p>Fifth: Proper methods, models and modes of organization are required -- organization of people and the modes by which they communicate and manage the other needs.<p>Finally: the civilization needs to progress. Review, refine, reinvent.<p>The problem is that with the Kardashev Scale, there is a fundamental failure to address something akin to a civilizations hierarchy of needs which must be addressed if there is any hope of evolving along this scale.<p>Using nuclear power as a way to awaken people to this might work.<p>The problem is that we are completely consumed with individual greed which manifests in the very fabric of our society to such a degree that we cannot even fix the current systems of resource/political/energy control to build consensus around a plan to evolve as a whole.<p>We are far to in the weeds on every single level of such a hierarchy, pulled with distractions, disinfo and FUD to make real progress.<p>---<p>BTW check out these pics of the reactor... I am amazed that it is as good as it is given the state of the reactor buildings. Given the fact that the spent fuel storage were in the TOPS of these structures which we now see lay in practically rubble, leads me to believe that we really do not have any clue where this really will head as we don't have concrete evidence (the outside public, not those really dealing with this) that the materials haven't simply just spilled all over the place.<p><a href=""http://cryptome.org/eyeball/daiichi-npp/daiichi-photos.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptome.org/eyeball/daiichi-npp/daiichi-photos.htm</a>",1301809561

2401917,comment,2398238,2400573,1,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""Craigslist inverts this relationship and puts the power into the readers' hand""</i><p>No, it doesn't - it puts powers into <i>other advertisers'</i> hands as much as it does the users. You are also forgetting that time is not a fundamentally equal resource - in my case it seems like there are griefers on the subcategory who consistent (and around the clock, it seems) flag posts that rub them the wrong way. Perhaps it's other regular posters trying to push competing posts out of the way (very, very likely, and in fact a common tactic), or maybe a disgruntled user with a beef against a subcategory and too much time on his hands. The problem here is griefers - and there is no mechanism to stop them.<p>Compare this with MMORPGs - players with a <i>lot</i> of time on their hands can stand to be incredibly powerful in ways that normal players cannot. Most games balance for this by nerfing extreme regulars and boosting infrequent players to lessen the gap. It doesn't <i>remove</i> the incentive of playing more, but it prevents situations where a bunch of Lv. 100 wizards are just constantly destroying a bunch of Lv. 10 noobs. CL faces the same problem - the morality police, griefers, and other obsessive users gum up the entire system.<p>> <i>""That so many here are angry about having gotten flagged off in the past tells me that they were doing the bare minimum in writing their ad anyway.""</i><p>This is an attitude I saw a lot on the flag-help forum, but I read through a <i>large</i> number of threads and I'd wager 95% of them were <i>just fine</i> - neither violating the TOU, nor being offensive, nor being illegal... There are <i>many</i> lower-traffic subcategories where the flag threshold for being pulled is absurdly low.<p>That's the problem with flag-help. Most posts submitted there don't have anything obviously wrong with them, and the flag-helpers are either there to flog the newbie for daring to have a post that got flagged, or speculate on various non-obvious reasons why a post was flagged. In the end nobody gets anywhere except in the 5% of cases where the questionable nature of the post is obvious, this is pointed out, and everyone goes on their merry ways.<p>> <i>""By and large the people most frustrated with their Craigslist posting experience are those who just barf out a self-serving ad and expect the invisible hand of Adam Smith to protect their ""right"" to get $1200 for a Britney Spears ticket.""</i><p>Citation required. I hung out on the flag-help forum for a couple of hours after posting my own, digging through past posts. The <i>vast</i> majority of the posts that go through there are neither self-serving nor entitled. They're just normal ads that get pulled for seemingly inexplicable reasons. The flag feature is neither accountable nor does it come with context. All there is is speculation on <i>maybe, kind of, probably</i> why something was flagged, where really this information needs to come from the flaggers themselves. The usage of the flag as an offensive feature between posters is also almost trivially easy to stop, but yet CL has done nothing.<p>The flag-help forum posters are also ill-qualified for the job, since <i>they</i> don't have any data on why posts get flagged either! All they can do is speculate - but without <i>any</i> input from real flaggers their speculation is about as reliable as anyone else's. For obvious offensiveness this works, but from what I saw the vast majority of posts that pass through there were flagged for anything but obvious reasons, and the responses are not informed.<p>> <i>""If this was your experience, I'd look to the attitude of the person asking for help.""</i><p>I gather from the tone of this sentence that you're a flag-help poster yourself. I saw dozens of puzzled people come into the forum, be perfectly respectful and polite, only to be faced with snark and derision from the ""old boys club"" of flag-help users. The prevailing attitude was ""how dare you post something that got flagged, you sketchy sleazebag you! Here's some random speculation from me because there's nothing <i>obviously</i> wrong with your post, and your confusion and bewilderment as a result will only be further proof that you are not only posting shite content to the site, but clueless to boot!""<p>I've given up on Craigslist entirely from both a user and advertiser perspective. Mass-posters routinely flout the minimum-post-frequency guidelines, with nobody seemingly policing this abuse. Large advertisers will routinely flag competing posts to weed out competition. Griefers make the smaller, low-traffic subcategories impossible to use. Craigslist used to be a reliable way to just find simple classifieds, but the griefers and spammers have gotten more savvy and are exploiting the system straight to hell, and CL is still operating in the bubble of ""the users know what's best"" when their main audience has little to no say at all.",1301809155

From this perspective, what you'd want to say is that large market share advantages are extremely defensible and can let you crush the little guys (which apple was through the 90's). But how do you get there in the first place?<p>The analogy between android/iOS and windows/mac I think has to be well-taken, but most discussions (including this one) leave out the most important difference. Windows got to sell a hojillion units by being the best at selling to business. You buy multi-thousand-dollar machines for all your employees because you expect productivity increases; you don't worry too hard about whether they like the machines or not. The decision maker buys on specs and price if it's not just a salesforce versus salesforce game (a likely win for the open platform because there are more players behind it).<p>The current generation of mobile, however, is a consumer phenomenon. Businesses aren't buying modern smartphones for their employees -- they're hooking the employees' phones into their networks. Adoption is not driven by purchasing managers but by consumers and therefore by user experience, consumer marketing, branding, etc. in addition to specs and price. This puts the open platform with the worse user experience for the average user at a big disadvantage, particularly if the price differential isn't that large in absolute dollars, which it isn't by comparison with the computers of the 90's (the gap between comparably-specced PC's and mac's being enough to buy multiple smartphones).<p>I don't know that it makes sense to think of any platform being as strong a winner as windows was; the very presence in the market of a company eager to use an operating system as a loss leader means that android will probably never shrink as small as apple did. However, Apple's advantages in design and branding play to the challenges of the mobile market in a way that they simply didn't for PCs. To this, add the scale advantage Apple currently enjoys (as monopsony buyer of flash memory and LCD's) that locks in big profits that competitors can't touch and it seems quite clear which way the playing field is tilted.<p>tl;dr: windows won by owning the business market; mobile plays to apple's strengths in a way PC's never have.",1301808629

There is an absolutely essential qualifier required on the end of any assertion about nuclear safety, and I'm glad to see that you put it in parentheses here. Nuclear power is the best...<i>at scale</i>. It's completely rational to recognize that for what it is.<p>I will be the first to praise the virtues of renewable energy. Solar, wind, tidal, and so on are all far better implementations to solve the problem of producing electricity.

This article is only one of dozens making that point.<p>However, people take this idea a bit too far, by not putting it into the right time context. A truly bad nuke disaster is forever (not <i>literally</i>, but for all intents and purposes). And we've never really had one yet. The thinking that Chernobyl is as bad as it can get is totally, obviously wrong--but it is implicit in a lot of the discussion.<p>Maybe Fukushima won't get to the level of Chernobyl--and that's still a maybe btw, as it is still getting worse--but it's easy and plausible to conceive of how it could have been much worse. A couple more serial failures, the epicenter of the quake being closer, whatever--this ancient, obsolete plant could very well have had all six reactors achieve full meltdown.<p>The woeful, pathetic--even funny, it's so bad--disaster preparedness that we now know TEPCO had implemented confirms a basic thing a lot of us have suspected: collectively, as a society (or separately, as a bunch of disparate societies), we just might not be mature enough in our thinking to strike the right balance of precaution and preparedness to handle nuclear power as safely as it should be handled.<p>Technologically, I think nuke power is awesome. Societally, our ability to responsibly deal with the dangers it presents is very suspect, IMO. Unfortunately, I think that is a much harder problem to address.<p>Probably some societies are better than others at this. Much like some seven year olds are responsible enough to handle a pocket knife and others totally aren't.<p>What we've seen (and are still seeing) in Japan has been much more pathetic, unprepared, and technologically primitive than a lot of us would have expected. Much more like my dumbshit little nephew who cut off the tip of his little finger and then sat there crying about it than like the one who taught himself to whittle sticks into Indian figurines.<p>Because the response to Fukushima has been so haphazard, reactive, and incompetent, I think many normal people now have this gut-reaction urge to reevaluate nuclear power, and that urge is basically correct. Of course, there is a lot of hysteria and empirically incorrect thinking flying around, but that happens any time a large number of humans discuss just about anything.<p>Still, the takeaway from this disaster shouldn't be 'nuclear power is teh awesome! no problem, bro!! nukes ftw!!'<p>It should be that nuclear power is indeed awesome, but our human systems that govern the deployment, administration, safeguarding, and--perhaps most importantly--sunsetting of nuclear power plants needs to be significantly reworked and dramatically improved.<p>I don't see why we should build even one more plant without the safety planning and preventive measures being an order of magnitude better than they have been so far. OTOH, I hope we can get it together to demand that work be done, and then do it, so that we can build more power plants, so that we can get our electricity back and I can turn on my lights and air conditioner here without feeling like an asshole.",1301807669

Since the pools holding them have either boiled away due to the absence of active cooling or drained into the basement due to damage, it is likely these rods overheated.

Heck, I don't know, but say they do a good job at attracting users.<p>Think about the power of the data they can collect.  If they get a statistically significant sample of traders, stockalicious could start their own hedge fund.

17838,comment,17669,17705,0,0,ralph,,,"What extra data is in the closure for ""reply"" that means it isn't a simple URL?  Is it just what to do after the reply is complete, i.e. what post to return to viewing?  Is there a reason this isn't taken from the Referer instead?<p>I guess this technique doesn't scale too well unless the hash table is either shared across servers or a user is kept on one server, which then causes problems of its own.<p>I'm guessing 20,000 closures is plenty and I've been bitten by server restarts.  Out of curiosity, do you keep track of the minimum age of the 20,000th hash entry prior to deleting to make room for another?  If that's something huge, it would confirm server restarts are the normal reason the ""unknown fnid"" message is seen.",1177836213

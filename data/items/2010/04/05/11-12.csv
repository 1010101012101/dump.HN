Now a little longer and in the 1000+ range you claim. </obsessive compulsive correcting><p>It was more to do with how long it has previously been between betas, release candidates and finals. Sorry if that point was not as obvious as I originally thought it was.<p>It is such a tiny data set to be able to accurately predict when the next version is coming out, but here's my analysis:<p>* For Rails 1.2 there was 17 days between release candidate and actual release. There were/are no betas.<p>* There were 2 months between the preview release announcement for Rails 2 and the first release candidate, then another month before the release of Rails 2.<p>Therefore, if the past is anything to go by, there will be a couple of months between the beta and the actual release but the large part (cliche: 99%) of the work is complete.<p>I don't want to suggest anything too solid, a release candidate could be released tomorrow for all we know, but given the number of regressions covered in the blog post I would give it another <i>two to four weeks</i> before they release the RC.

1241682,comment,1241599,1241639,0,0,ugh,,,"I’m quite tired of those grandiose declarations of what the iPad will achieve myself but I have to correct your history a bit.<p>We know of examples were new technology of delivering media killed old technology. CDs killed LPs, DVDs killed VHS tapes. (In the same way in which cars killed horse carriages – there are still some out there but they don’t really matter.) Other technologies fundamentally changed just how we use media. DVRs did that to TV.<p>So just why do we see certain change but not other kinds of change? My personal little theory is that certain modes of consuming media will pretty much always be useful, independent of the available technology.<p>Delivering just text will in certain situations probably always be cheaper than delivering visuals and audio (no need to produce expensive visuals or hire a speaker), I also think that it just might be more effective to take in certain information by reading rather than any other way. Consequently something like newspapers and books will always exist (with or without the text being printed on dead trees). You can make a very similar argument for Radio.<p>The big thing about computers has always been that they can potentially deliver everything. Just text. Just audio. Just visuals. Or all that in any combination you wish. So, sure, computers (and that includes the iPad) might just be able to kill newspapers, radio, TV, books. But just as we <i>know</i> them. There will probably always be devices which allow us to read text, listen to something or watch and listen to something.",1270466789

However, to place it as an anti-creativity agent infiltrating our lives is either disingenious or misinformed.<p>There's no doubt different interests are at stake here, and that old media is trying desperately to feel in control again. But media consumption is but an use case for this and similar devices. To reduce it to that and ignore the amazing things people have been doing with their post-iPhone mobiles is to dumbly state only the issue of content distribution (written content, mostly) is relevant in this discussion.<p>Look at Everyday Looper, the many drawing apps, the games. You can argue any way you want about how it isn't an IDEAL situation, but there's vibrance in the community of developers, and a growing number of things users can achieve. I am not a musician, and I have been working beats. My drawing frustrates me a lot, but on my phone I feel free to sketch, and it allows me to spend my time in more creative ways than I would have a couple of years ago. And maybe, just maybe, all that arises from the perceived stability of the platform as opposed to Android (and its many versions): people can target it in code, people can use it and know it will be a thought trampoline, and that different trampolines will come out soon.<p>We all have our biases, and too easily frame situations as if our version of inside baseball were paramount to the fate of the world. While we do it, people will keep churning great ideas wherever they feel enabled to do so. Apple is kind of like New York, or Berlin, or Paris in that sense: there's much to dislike about it, but it provides enough of a cushion for creatives (including programmers), enough inspiration in the form of the works of others, to help make great things.",1270465943

If each table transformation is a function, the language becomes considerably more flexible. Consider the following syntax:<p><pre><code>    users where(u => u.login = ""foo"" and u.passwd = SHA1(""secret"" + u.salt))\n</code></pre>\nSince ""where"" is a function, we can isolate just this transformation:<p><pre><code>    authenticate(login, password) := \n       where(u => u.login = login and u.passwd = SHA1(password + u.salt))\n</code></pre>\nNow ""authenticate"" is a table transformation as well:<p><pre><code>    users authenticate(""foo"", ""secret"")\n</code></pre>\nThis is a trivial example, but this could just as easily apply to more complex queries. One could construct functions to manage ""nested set"" tables, or create custom aggregation functions. Everything that is currently difficult or impossible under SQL.<p>Because SQL is so limited in what you can abstract, there's very little room to factor out common code.

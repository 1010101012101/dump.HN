1644923,comment,1641072,1641072,0,0,roryokane,,,"There is a problem with the example he gives, of parsing “Create a window with a table view, and then when someone clicks a button, add an entry to the table view”. I think a future programming language could actually make a program out of that. I agree that there is not enough information in that sentence to be sure that the program is what the user wants, but in this case, the language can use a popular technique in programming: have defaults. For instance, most languages have a file I/O library. If you open a file without saying whether you want to read or write to it, the compiler doesn’t complain, it just chooses the default. If you realize the default isn’t what you want, you can change it.<p>Similarly, a future language could parse the given sentence as “put a single-column table view on the left, and a button on the right that says ‘Add an Entry to the Table View’, and when the button is clicked, just put the string Entry at the bottom of the table view”. And then the programmer tries this out and tells the programming language “no, I want the button at the bottom, and it should say ‘Add Person’”, and the language makes the necessary changes and follows defaults otherwise, choosing to left-align the button at the bottom rather than center it, and resizing the button to fit the text. And the programmer could just keep specifying more details about what a Person is, and how you edit it, and you can make a program in this way.<p>Basically, this is just like modern libraries: instead of writing your own HTML parser nowadays, you can use a library with a “default” (non-custom) way of parsing HTML. In the future, rather than specifying your GUI and attached code in exact detail, you can just use a library of defaults. It will probably be the case that programmers in the future would simply move on to bigger and harder problems than GUIs with code, as gaius mentioned at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1641514"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1641514</a>, but I think programming at the level we know it actually will get easier.",1283126282

These people took good money for pasting AAA credit ratings on piles of the most implausible shit imaginable, and what’s irritating isn’t that they did it, it’s that apparently they didn’t break any laws and thus there’s little prospect of the long prison terms that anything smelling of natural justice would require.</i><p>If anyone is looking for a YC application idea, there's one right there. To be more explicit:<p>Ratings agencies currently are paid by investment companies to rate the risk associated with the products they are bringing to market (ie, the fox is paying the farmer to tell the chickens how safe the hen house is ).<p>The financial incentives for ratings agencies are aligned with the sellers, not the buyers. That creates a huge risk for the buyers, because they can't (or shouldn't) trust the ratings.<p>There's an opportunity there to create a company that does ratings but takes money from the buyers, not the sellers.<p>(Note that entrenched players will go to huge lengths to tell you how hard this is, and how smart all the ""financial engineers"" are.

1644883,comment,1643318,1644391,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Here's a good essay on Canadian vs American unemployment numbers. Structurally, the Canadian unemployment rate has largely tracked the American one, but been higher. The professor who wrote this essay delved into the reasons why and found that the unemployed in Canada were more likely to search out work and therefore be counted as unemployed (i.e. the definition of unemployed in both countries being folks who seek work but currently have no job).<p><a href=""http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/criddell/canusune.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/criddell/canusune.pdf</a><p>Also, Canadians have traditionally been supportive of quality public education and other social institutions. The person serving coffee at a Tim Hortons working minimum wage probably was in the same school system as the person he or she is serving who might be a banker. Private schooling is typically relegated to the upper middle class/rich, and those parents who want to send their children to religious schools (e.g., Jews or Muslims, as Catholic schools are fully publicly funded in many provinces).<p>Speaking as a university dropout and child of a middle class family in the poorest, most stigmatized part of Toronto, it was expected of all my friends that we get a post-secondary education. There was no question about it. Census numbers seem to back this up (<a href=""http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-595/P2C.cfm?TPL=RETR&LANG=E&GC=35080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/pro...</a>). There were roughly 14 000 people aged 25-34 in that area of the city. Only 4 000 of these people had no post secondary education. Anecdotally, there's a Catholic high school in the area that installed a day care so that it could accept mothers (usually unwed teenagers of course). It was a little bit controversial when it was first started, but this was in the early 1990s long before these kind of things were normal. Incidentally, that same Catholic high school also supplied free condoms in their bathrooms, much to the dismay of the Church. There's much more of a push to be educated here in Canada than what I see in the U.S.. So that might be what you saw during your visits.<p>Also keep in mind that because we have universal health care, it's much easier for the mentally ill to seek and get the help they need before it's too late and they end up on the street. That said, I live in downtown Toronto now and most of the older homeless that I encounter seem to be mentally ill or have addiction problems. The younger ones usually come from abusive households, so that's what drives them into the streets.",1283124819

Think about how the prices would flow through the economy.<p><i>Nominal</i> wages across the spectrum would increase at various rates, leading to a general price inflation. <i>Actual</i> wage increases, if any, would last only until the market adjusted to the new price levels.<p>In the meantime, the structure of the market would shift to become more capital-intensive and less labor-intensive, and would increase imports from labor-rich but capital-poor nations.  Prices are information, and the market obeys.  When you tell the market that labor is more expensive, it will adapt to need less labor or look for it elsewhere.  It's not clear to me how such a scheme helps low-skilled workers.<p>Now, of course no one is arguing for a $100 minimum wage, but the economic effects of a smaller minimum wage are different only in magnitude.<p>The core flaw is not understanding that prices emerge from the market.

Doesn't matter, says the court: call it what you will, but there are fiduciary duties at play.<p>* FG claims they couldn't have had a real relationship because TC's Arrington made statements about both parties sharing profits, and both sides bearing its own losses. <i>So what?</i> asks the court: that's part of the definition of a partnership. Not to mention: TC already has shouldered some of FG's expenses.<p>* FG claims there's no partnership because a TC employee proposed actions that would have put TC in breach. But a ""potential breach"" (which TC management prevented) doesn't absolve FG of any duties.<p>* FG claims there couldn't have been a real partnership because TC had threatened to unilaterally dissolve the venture. <i>So what?</i> asks the court: as long as TC lives up to its obligations, it has that right.<p>* FG claims there's no evidence of co-ownership of the business. <i>And?</i> asks the court. It's the joint venture that created the fiduciary duties, not ownership.<p>* FG claims that no joint venture could have existed because TC was negotiating to buy FG. Be that as it may, whatever duties FG had to TC in collaborating on the CrunchPad remain.<p>* Finally, and probably most importantly, and this is worth quoting directly:<p><i>Fusion Garage argues that the terms of the parties joint venture were simply too uncertain and unsettled to be enforceable. While it may be true that the parties never reached a meeting of the minds on how the business would operate on an ongoing basis, their cooperative efforts in developing the product were sufficient to give rise to an obligation on both parties' part not to usurp the fruits of those efforts.</i><p>In other words, see you in court.<p>I'm actually not that interested in the TC/FG saga, since I think that product was D.O.A. But I'm very interested in the legal dynamics of joint ventures, because it's not crazy to think I might be involved in another one someday. Food for thought.",1283124303

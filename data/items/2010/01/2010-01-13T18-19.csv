Ho hum.<p>The problem here is, as mattmaroon put it, if you buy into this logic we'd all still be chasing down antelopes on the savannah. At some point some civilizations, for whatever reason, start developing things like private property, the wheel, common law, reading, the printing press, etc.<p>It's become fashionable to say something like ""well, that doesn't make them any better than other civilizations"" but I think that's soft-headed horseshit. Anybody who lives in a civilization with private property, contract law, medicine, literature and art is living in a better place, and in a better way, that somebody who doesn't have it. Some cultures are demonstrably better than others, like it or not.<p>The interesting question, especially with alien stories, is ""How do two wildly diverse cultures interact in a way that is respectful of both?""<p>I've thought about this for some time, and using all the earthly examples I can come up with, the fact is they don't. If we ever meet another primitive species and interact with them? It's going to be very traumatic on the part of the other species. Likewise, if Cebulons from the Osari System arrive next week with technology five thousand years ahead of ours? You can say goodbye to a lot of what people think of when they talk about human culture.<p>And I guess I'm okay with that. If the Cebulons show up, I'm going to be first in line learning to speak Cebulonese, watching all the Cebulonese TV shows, and taking my kids to Cebulonese high schools. We will learn, adapt, and overcome, and the human species will continue. To me that's a lot more rational that sitting around moaning about how things might have/would have been had things not changed. I just hope the Cebulons come to trade and exploit our resources in a manner respectful of private property, so we can go to their system and do the same one day :)<p>I really did not like Avatar. Gorgeous, magnificent movie. Terrible hackneyed, one-dimensional plot. Ugh. I think a quote from Cameron's other movie is most apt: I vote we nuke it from orbit. It's the only way we can really be sure.",1263409155

The Americas were not conquered by force of arms, but by disease. A common pattern: send an expedition, which discovers cities, towns and gardens. Send another expedition years later: find nothing. I highly recommend the book 1491, which is a great historical account.<p>There was absolutely nothing (short of complete isolation until the development of modern medicine) which would have prevented the Indians from dying out.

We appear to be doing it on some scales in the modern age, certainly much better than we've done before, though not perfectly.<p>Still, homo sapiens largely wiped out neanderthal populations many eons ago. They had a similar to larger cranial capacity to cro-magnons and modern humans, they used and created tools, and there's some evidence of cultural artifacts such as jewelry around their sites. The signs point to a culture of intelligent humanoids, now almost completely wiped out (except with possible genetic relics in the human population). This genocide preceded civilization as we know it by millennia...<p>Placental mammals, crossing over to south america from the isthmus of Panama when it arose, almost completely destroyed marsupials in south america.

Fundamentally it is difficult for me to reason about when it is good for one creature to profit while others perish. I do know, though, that they are in a much more complicated relationship -- that it is impossible to separate one creature from its ecosystem, and that if no particular creature or plant or species is to be sacred above others, then surely it's the integrity and continued vitality of the ecosystem that matters. This is one reason I am an environmentalist: human beings now have immense power over the environment, and as such need to take responsibility for the fact that they can alter it, destroy it, or care for it.

Eg. HDMI better tuned than Component output. This is down to the way they manufacturer the circuitry, and not necessarily due to the type of technology itself",1263405784

No real change over the last 10 years?<p>As a rule I try to shy away inflammatory criticism, but this was a very poorly researched post.<p>There has been TREMENDOUS change over the past 10 years!  You have to remember that until Deng's reforms in the late 80s, China was a completely closed society that was just beginning to heal from decades of strife and instability (almost 100 years!), including the cultural revolution which literally turned society upside down and placed a freeze on societal progress.<p>Since the early 90s China has made leaps and bounds in regards to reform and progress.  YES they are still MANY problems, but the changes have been very substantial.  China will surpass Japan this year as the 2nd largest economy in the world.  Outside of the US and Russia, it holds the third largest stockpile of nuclear arms.  The accolades are many...<p>That said, its unfair to really compare China with South Korea/Japan, who've not only had a huge lead time, but also don't have 1.3 billion people to feed, provide jobs for, and yes control.<p>All of this growth and sudden change has caused problems, corruption and protectionist economic policies (not to mention the increasingly dangerous heights of nationalism the CCP is stimulating among the populace, especially the youth).  To say however that Chinese society is corrupt and have been ""meddling in business for thousands of years"" is absurd and frankly a bit fox-news in rhetoric.<p>One of the things I love most about HN is that the community here is in general ""smarter"" than more general-interest social news communities.  That said, I wish people would take a more balanced view on China.  Yes there are problems and the CCP is no benevolent big brother but as the poster above me has pointed out the issues are not black and white.  There are many many many nuances in uplifting a nation of 1.3 billion people into modernity.  I'm not convinced that an open, free-market system is the best solution.  Perhaps down the road, but not now.",1263405755

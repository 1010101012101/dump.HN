7202120,comment,7201676,7201878,2,0,acabal,,,"For the most part it&#x27;s either epub or mobi at this point in the ebook game, with the rare occasional pdf.  Epub and mobi are essentially interchangeable thanks to Calibre, and if you need PDF then you probably need more complex formatting than a Markdownesque language can provide.<p>Converting from Word <i>is</i> a problem, but that&#x27;s for different reasons: 1) authors (understandably) have no idea how to typeset, so each author has their own special bizarre style that&#x27;s almost always wrong, 2) the HTML produced by Word is a hideous wreck no matter how you slice it, and 3) each different version of Word produces wildly different, but equally monstrous, HTML.<p>Sadly the word processing game has been won by Word.  99% of non-techie authors will use Word (or maybe Scrivener) to write their novel and it&#x27;s tough to convince them to learn a formatting language when they can just press &#x27;bold&#x27; on the toolbar.<p>In either case we already have a format to be invisibly used by writing software: HTML/CSS.  It&#x27;s the underlying language for epub and mobi, it&#x27;s well understood and easily learned, it was specifically designed for book-like documents (and not web apps funnily enough), and programs <i>already</i> export in that format.  The problem is that some programs (like Sigil) do a better job of exporting than others (like Word).<p>Things like TOCs can be handled by using an open, easily-editable format like epub as a base format, then using Calibre to invisibly compile to different formats.  Calibre does a flawless job 99% of the time.<p>Edit: My creds are that I run one of the largest writing communities online, briefly ran an online ebook conversion service, and have composed and published ebooks myself.",1391885773

7202116,comment,7201828,7201828,4,0,resu_nimda,,,"<i>then people would be naturally great at probability</i><p>Where do you get that conclusion? Think of a baseball player with exceptional hand-eye coordination, who also knows absolutely nothing about any of the math or calculus behind it. There is a vast chasm between conscious and subconscious thought (where the latter might be viewed as the underlying &quot;intelligence model&quot;). I don&#x27;t agree that a (partially) probabilistic model would necessarily imply a proficiency at the conscious, communicable level.<p><i>we wouldn&#x27;t benefit from learning about and consciously using probability to solve problems, as our brain would already do it on a lower level.</i><p>Don&#x27;t understand this one either. Back to the baseball player - there is a lot of value we gain from our brains &quot;naturally&quot; solving e.g. inverse kinematics problems on the fly. But, there is also a lot we gain from understanding these mathematical concepts at the conscious level. Totally different realms, both useful.<p><i>Statistical methods generally need a big learning set to learn anything.</i><p>Ok, that&#x27;s a limitation of the current AI models. They&#x27;re not smart enough to infer the essential characteristics of an elephant from a small set (it&#x27;s also a very narrow approach...you don&#x27;t start a child off by showing them pictures of elephants, first they have to spend a long time acquiring basic fundamentals of knowledge and perception). I don&#x27;t see how that implies a more deterministic nature of organic intelligence.<p>Even the child might think something is an elephant and be wrong. But (IMO) it&#x27;s the same process of using the bits of knowledge you have to make a guess (and an estimated degree of certainty). &quot;It could be this thing or it could be that thing, and my model says it has the greatest probability of being this one, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going with.&quot;",1391885742

The shuttle was a bad design, with a high failure rate, and it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to lump it in with tried-and-true rockets, which have a far lower failure rate. Similarly, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to lump the dangerous RBMK reactor design used at Chernobyl with the far safer reactors designed in the West.<p>How many people died <i>in flight</i> during the Apollo missions? The answer is the same number that died as a result of the events at Three-Mile Island and Fukushima: zero. Design matters, and if you&#x27;re trying to be objective on this topic, you have to distinguish between good designs and bad ones.<p>Also, not all meltdowns are created equal, as your post suggests.

Music and Search are the only two which really stick out.<p>But even with Music, there&#x27;s an argument to be made about the opportunity cost of doing so. There&#x27;s no immediate benefit in spending dev cycles prettying up the AOSP Music app when no consumer will see it since every major OEM (Samsung, HTC, Sony etc) already have their own. Any time they set aside to that is time they could have used to work on the terrible latency problems plaguing the underlying audio system, which actually does make a difference across the board.<p>The same applies to Search. It&#x27;s much more effective to commit those dev cycles on the layers underlying it so that the whole ecosystem benefits. Few of the exclusive features of the current Google Search app make sense for a service agnostic device search app to have, which is the original role of that app plays (Google&#x27;s OS X app of the same name had the same featureset: <a href=""http://www.google.com/quicksearchbox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/quicksearchbox/</a>). Really there&#x27;s no motive to subvert the order of things and promote web search over OS search in a OS search app unless you own a search engine like Google.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say it (and Music) shouldn&#x27;t be updated, since they do serve as docs for 3rd party devs and OEMs, so not updating would have some indirect inverse effect on the quality of apps. But I can see why they haven&#x27;t got around to it yet given their trajectory.<p>tl;dr the situation is more grey than black or white.",1391885059

He was eight years old, standing in his friend Brian’s bedroom. Brian’s family had a house in Hawaii, and his walls in California were plastered with tearouts from Surfer magazine depicting palm trees, beautiful people, and the curling turquoise waves of the North Shore. <p>“I didn’t even know that world existed,” recalls Woodman, Muir ’97, who grew up surrounded by tech startups in the wealthy Silicon Valley community of Atherton. “But from then on, I knew I wanted to live in that world.” <p>Thirty years later, Woodman is still in Silicon Valley, but he’s tan and fit and has a cheeky freckled grin that suggests he’s living the good life. He should be grinning. He’s the founder and CEO of GoPro—one of the world’s fastest growing camera companies, now worth an estimated $2.25 billion. He’s created a device that helps people capture and share their passions from the North Shore and way beyond. <p>￼It started as a durable wrist-mounted camera for surfers to record their feats in the lineup—effectively helping them “go pro.” Now the palm-size cameras, which sell from $200 to $400, can be fastened to helmets, handlebars, ski poles, and, yes, surfboards to document experiences both ordinary and extraordinary. Last October, the Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner—equipped with five GoPros—jumped from 24 miles above the earth’s surface, breaking the world record for the highest and fastest freefall, and broadcasting it live for all to see. A few months later, the cameras were streaming 30-foot waves at the Mavericks Invitational surf contest in Half Moon Bay, Calif., and a few days after that, snowboard slides and backside airs at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colo.

It was always a tricky bird to fly, and in the early days there were about half a dozen different things that could kill it outright with a shockingly high probability (not just the SRBs or foam/ice strikes on the TPS, also the APUs (which caught fire and exploded on one flight), the computer (which was completely inoperable just before landing on another flight), the SSMEs (which came close to causing loss of the orbiter once or twice), and other components).

Hint: they did&#x27;t. It would have been cost prohibitive.   And if this was a legal problem, you can bet there would have been news stories about these same indie darlings getting slapped with massive fines/penalties from various countries for not registering.<p>It&#x27;s not necessary to have a business nexus to sell software <i>into</i> an EU country (or most countries, for that matter); nor is it necessary to file VAT returns if you are using a store such as Google Play--Google handles both for you since <i>they, not you</i> are the seller of record.  That&#x27;s part of what you pay the 30% for.  It&#x27;s the same with Apple and MS.<p>The business registration and VAT filings are necessary only if you sell directly to the customers <i>and</i> do so by physically interacting with the customer in their country.<p>The best way to sum up the problem with the blog post you linked is with a quote from the post itself: \n&quot;Does it apply to your App? Does it apply to our games? I don’t know, I’m not a lawyer, I’m not an accountant.

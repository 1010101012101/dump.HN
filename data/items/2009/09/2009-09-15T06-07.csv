823414,comment,822321,822321,0,0,patio11,,,"If this worries you, assume nothing you type can be ever deleted.<p>I own a very, VERY small web application.  It takes input from users and, potentially, saves it to the database, then performs operations on it.<p>Suppose a user types ""foobar"" into my application, waits a while, and then tells me ""Hey, I want you to totally erase any evidence that I ever typed ""foobar"".  Well, um, I don't think it is physically possible for me to do so.<p>Minimally, ""foobar"" is now present in my database.  I can zap that fairly easily.  Foobar might also be present at a few places in memcached, which are difficult to me to calculate but theoretically accessible to me.  I suppose if they're theoretically accessible I could, with significant effort, call them up again, which means that with significant effort I can delete them.  OK, zap.<p>Then I have backups of my database.  And here's where delete starts to become a matter of ""Uh oh, now we're talking hard.""  I can't just blow away information in a database backup -- I'd have to unpack it, load it into a database (binary dumps = do not work on me with ad hoc tools!), blow away the record, then save.  This would have to be done very carefully to avoid nasty effects if two or more people wanted to blow away data at the same time, since maintaining ACID guarantees is pretty difficult when you've got multiple independent copies of the same database running around.  At this point, I'm already strongly inclined to say ""If it ever hits the database backups, it potentially stays until doomsday.""<p>Then we have server backups.  My server is a VPS.  If you were in the database backup saved on disk at T1, when a server backup happened (which freezes an image of the VPS in time so that I can return to exactly the same state as T1), then <i>even if I blow away the backup</i> there is ANOTHER opaque backup in an even more opaque data structure.  So I'd have to spin up another VPS from the image (for each image I have), deal with the pains of moving that to the present day/time, load each backup on the VPS, blow away your record, refreeze the database, then refreeze the VPS.<p>All of this unfreezing and refreezing presents many, many opportunities for me to corrupt other users' data, which is the reason I have the backups in the first place.  Corrupting data is unacceptable.<p>Except, wait, I'm not the only one who has copies of my images!  Slicehost also has redundant backups of the images because I can't lose an image if they lose the box the image is on!  So I'd need to somehow gain access of their backups (which I have <i>no control over</i>) to spin up the VPS to spin up the backup to nuke the record to backup the DB to snapshot the VPS to remake the backup of the hard drive containing hundreds of images from people who are not me.<p>EXCEPT WAIT!  It is conceivable that, without notice to me, Slicehost has moved from owning their own backup media into a cloud storage solution.  Which, for reliability, would duplicate the backup machine multiple times!  So now we need to access each of the the copies of the backup machine to spin up each of the images to spin up the database so we can nuke the record to save the database to snapshot the image to back up the snapshot to replicate the backup machine which persists the backups of the snapshots containing the backups of the database which holds your record.<p>So, yep, that's where I am.  You probably did not read my privacy policy, but I'm pretty sure it says something to the effect of ""I make no guarantees about being able to delete your data.""  That is as much as I am going to say of the matter.  As soon as you give me the data to hold for a <i>nanosecond</i> it could very well be out of my control to ever delete again.",1252997154

I went through this, too, when I got a surprise message from Foursquare saying, ""You've been unseated as the mayor of such-and-such!"" Really, who cares? I haven't checked in at all since I realized that Foursquare makes it into a competition.<p>Don't even get me started on Parallel Kingdom. I nearly lost a friend to that game.<p>What I liked about Dodgeball was that it gave me a kind of third eye when going to a venue I hadn't been to before. I was able to go to the Dodgeball website with my phone, see the photos of people who had checked in at that particular venue and approach them since they seemed to know more about the venue than I did and they practically invited these kinds of interactions by being users of Dogdeball.<p>That was in 2000, I think, and I used it until Google bought the site. They were kind enough to give everyone 2 weeks to delete their accounts before transferring everything to Google's servers. I still have privacy concerns with these kinds of sites, but now I have no problem broadcasting my location if I'm at a public event that's been announced somewhere else already.<p>Would you continue using Foursquare if it didn't have competitive and teritorial gameplay?",1252996339

Most do.  Thats just how it is.  In the case of YC, failure means you probably ship something, then fail to go much past there.  Which is better than not shipping anything, or spending a year on something nobody wants before you ever ship.<p>A high failure rate is valid criticism, but judging from how many YC companies get follow-on funding, I'd say the model works just fine.

823374,comment,822617,823255,0,0,netsp,,,"Without getting into a very detailed discussion, let me put it this way. I think a convoluted system is the price of such a system. It boils down to the need to define startup. This is something we are better off not doing. Once you give startups special rights of some sort, companies & people have an incentive to be 'startups' rather than just companies. People might have an incentive to be startups rather than professionals. This is the kind of distortion I was talking about.<p>I think that attempts to minimise distortions by not letting them come into play in the market is closing loopholes. They are usually problematic in themselves.<p>The ideas posed by pg & this article are that the small issue of defining startup can be easily worked around by piggybacking on the implicit definition of startup used by investors. Either ask them (panel) or use their investment as a qualifier. My criticism of the latter approach is that you can't just assume that investors' actions will be uninfluenced by their newfound superpower. It will allow them to get better terms, for example. It may allow them to get the deal in the first place.You hear of cases startups want an investor primarily for the contacts and advice, rather than capital. I could easily imagine the visa being the primary reason. Since being a 'recognized investor' is such an advantageous position, others will want to do this too. Are YC type organizations more likely to be recognized? If so then this distorts the market in favour of them. YC will become an immigration path (like study is).<p>The panel approach is also problematic. You are creating a bureaucratic gatekeeper. These tend to be the worst kind. First, the panel decides if a startup is worthwhile. then, the market gets its turn.<p>My pick out of the two would be a panel. It avoids the need to have  recognized investors, only recognized startups. But apart from corruption, expect to have decisions made by bureaucracies before the market gets a crack.<p>Barriers to immigration are like barriers to trade. Barriers this high in trade would be under incredible pressure.<p>*I have no problem with immigration. I am not American or in America. i am an immigrant myself (in Australia). My preferred long term solution would be lowering or even removing barriers to immigration completely by some point.",1252994729

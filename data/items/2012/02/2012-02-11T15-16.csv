""let x=1"" is quite clearly syntactic sugar for ""(lambda(x) { ... rest of block here ... })(1)"" so while you might argue that it's unnecessary (I'd disagree, but it's a respectable argument), you can't realistically claim that it would be adding a layer of complexity.

In the context of capturing user feedback, the point of a screenshot is to relay information about the state of the user's environment to someone else, without the need for physical proximity.<p>In my experience, users who report feedback are typically concerned more with the data on the page than how the page itself looks when it's rendered.  In these cases, a screenshot acts as proof and can immediately focus the problem without requiring a lot of written description.  Among users who have non-trivial feedback about a website, the likelihood of their being able to clearly and concisely describe their problem is vanishingly small, and removing the friction of attaching screenshots to their issue reports is immensely helpful.",1328975197

The first animation sequence is therefore in the order provided by the tax authorities and roughly follows postal codes (starting in Oslo, moving round the coast up to Northern Norway). The particles simply spawn at a fixed rate as we move through the data with the camera attempting to follow the spawn points. Whenever you reach a large city you'll see a concentrated burst as you ascend through its postal codes. Other orderings can be quite informative as well: sorting for age or income in a particular region can display distinct patterns for segments of groups. As was pointed out: the particle animation is too complex to have much salience, but I'm prepared to argue that the slower animations towards the end show clear patterns when comparing different demographies.",1328974796

It's great for reasoning from first principles as in philosophy (where we want to wrestle with deep abstractions but don't need more than basic <i>a priori</i> knowledge to do so).And it's great for building on top of domain knowledge (as in law schools where students read the facts of a case and its procedural history in advance, and then the professor challenges students to explain why a case got decided a particular way). But as a means for acquiring domain knowledge - gathering facts rather than technique, and building those facts into a context - it's quite inefficient. Another problem is that it's not very responsive to the needs of weak students - teachers are likely to put most of their attention on the good students who can sustain long causal chains of reasoning rather than weak (or shy) ones who get stuck or intimidated, and the more advanced the exchange between the professor and a strong student, the harder it can be for bystanders to keep up. One way of testing a student is to bait them with what seems like an easy question that will lead them off point into a dead end; this is potentially humiliating for the student if the teacher is aggressive (which then dilutes the lesson somewhat with negative emotions, both for the student and possibly sympathetic onlookers). If the student is sharp enough to see the trap and deflect or decline a series of invitations to error, the chain of reasoning that links the points of a complex argument together gets 'stretched out' and onlookers may lose sight of the overall direction or (worse) fail to appreciate the potential pitfalls that the teacher is drawing attention to because they are being skillfully avoided.",1328973426

It's the strange quoting rules that can cause some text to become an expression which is executed. It's just an accident waiting to happen and I kept running into that many times. 'expr' seems like an eval that you can't get rid of.<p>I'm a bit surprised how language feature like this became the standard way of doing basic things.

Several European countries already implement DNS-level blocking of sites for copyright reasons, and the internet hasn't broken.""<p>Yes. Those European countries, along with China, etc., have broken the internet. Reminds me of that Tim and Eric skit ""The Internette"". The whole thing fits on a CD, and if you want to shop online, you print out an order form and mail it in! It has 5 songs to choose from! Safe from viruses and hackers! What more could you want?<p>Yes, fracturing the network and blocking content breaks the internet. It's a step backwards to the days of centralized broadcast channels. Reminds me of the ""lend me"" feature on Kindles. The entire benefit of ebooks is that they're digital and can be shared. ""Allowing"" somebody to lend their books puts them back on par with hard copies. It's like ""allowing"" me to use my car, as long as I hook a horse up to the front of it.",1328972944

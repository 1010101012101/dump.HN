You should do them if they provide value to you and your business, and create more value than equity they require.

I&#x27;m just pointing out that it can be done cheaply with better flexibility and precision by hackers like me. I&#x27;m one of those people who find the Nest algorithm frustrating and want to tinker with it (with more properly placed sensors etc). It&#x27;s not really rocket science for people who understand the basics of control theory.<p>BTW, what does a deadbolt have anything to do with your Nest/HVAC system? Do you want to depend on Google to open/close your locks as well? It&#x27;s _not_ normal to take 15-30 seconds to open a Z-wave deadbolt remotely (it&#x27;s immediate if you use the lock keypad) with 50% of success rate: something (probably the security C/R exchanges) is timing out: the default timeout is 20 seconds. For me, it was 100% (knocking on wood:) with a few seconds latency for the times I tried, executing a night arrival scene from a phone in a car, which turned on path/door lights and unlocked the door, because I&#x27;d have groceries/takeouts in my both hands.<p>I&#x27;d tend to agree that Z-Wave devices and a Vera* controller is probably too much for non-tinkerers to handle in the current state, because average people can&#x27;t even handle a wifi printer :). There are people who use Nest as a basic thermostat, i.e., for the looks only.<p>The main motivation for me to squawk on this topic is that I don&#x27;t like the _trend_ of external services (nothing against Google per se :) owning my data and now control of my home.<p>We (hackers/tinkerers) can do better and demand a choice.",1394520259

First, kids don&#x27;t really know what makes a good slide - they&#x27;ll take opaque things like a orange peel and hope to see something (you can only see transparent or semi-transparent stuff). Second, it takes a fair bit of attention to learn how to hold it up to your eye and move the focusing stage around. Third, it&#x27;s hard for a young kid to build one of these without supervision, and if you&#x27;re a teacher in a 30-kid classroom, you can&#x27;t supervise kids individually.

This isn&#x27;t just not helpful, it&#x27;s actively harmful.  By anointing themselves as the local &quot;conveyor belt&quot; for interesting companies and talented entrepreneurs incubators have created confusion in the market that harms perfectly good founders who do not participate.

It has become a sort of tax or validation stamp that we are all expected to seek out...  and after that go on Shark Tank?!  Then at some point we get acquired by Yahoo?<p>Successful startup outcomes and solvency in the incubator world are not correlated well.  The companies that are selected are carefully directed through a maze of expensive professional services controlled by the program directors.  The bargain becomes... if you use this lawyer, this PR consultant and this accounting firm we will support you.  What this means is that every failed startup isn&#x27;t really a failure because in the end that company spends all their money paying off the incubator&#x27;s network.  It&#x27;s an engine of corruption that takes advantage of people and companies that can least afford it.  Whether they create any real startup success is not especially relevant to their continued survival, it&#x27;s just a bonus.<p>Many incubator programs also tends to select for people who are very well behaved, polite and have simple A to B ideas.  True disruptive innovation is usually created by disruptive people who have very big ideas.<p>I don&#x27;t think incubators really intend to hurt founders or the market, but they do.",1394519631

7377720,comment,7377384,7377384,1,0,rachellaw,,,"Carlson is looking at things from a very narrow perspective. If the industry has high barriers to entry, an incubator can help because it just gives that extra lead time you need to get a product to launch. Not all products are apps that you can churn out in the basement to profitability.<p>What if you have additional inventory? What if you need to purchase forwarding commodity price? What if your idea is simply new enough that you don&#x27;t have any precedents? Incubators can help with that, especially if they have a lawyer and accountant at hand.<p>There&#x27;s also a third factor, which is that if you&#x27;re an international/immigrant or someone from a state unfamiliar with tech industry, then the connections are helpful. The idea of low fidelity networks being worse off is absolute bullshit though, it&#x27;s been proven over and over again that a large network of weak ties generates a stronger overall response than a small network of strong ties. Weak ties is what builds communities and gives people jobs (which tbh, is exactly what Linkedin managed to do so well technologically)",1394518119

Look, you can fuck up your time with any incubator by not focusing on things important to your startup. Dave McClure and the other partners there will yell at you for doing this, and the common theme is &quot;Get back to fucking work&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t waste your time with bullshit meetings.&quot;<p>The overall feeling is: build, get customers, experiment and verify, and build.<p>The problem is that most accelerators (500 included) have a TON of opportunity for distraction, and undisciplined founders get distracted. For us, 500 was immensely useful because it gave us a network of people to reach out to that didn&#x27;t exist in our world before 500. For finding customers, verifying assumptions, user testing, raising funding, and all that other stuff that startups have to do, this was incredibly important.<p>tl;dr: incubators are what you make of them. you can waste your time, or it can be the most productive time you&#x27;ll ever have, and it all depends on your discipline. you&#x27;ll have more opportunity than you would otherwise, but you have to be disciplined about what avenues you pursue and which you don&#x27;t. the same is true of college, incidentally.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s important to note that I made this mistake freshman year at MIT, and learned from it. There was so much opportunity for learning, initially, that I squandered it and tried to do too much. I was incredibly busy, but never really got anything done. I learned to focus on what&#x27;s important, but the resources I had at MIT meant that focus was better utilized than it would have been at a smaller school with fewer opportunities. The same is true for incubators/accelerators; we saw undisciplined founders have this problem, but we took full advantage of all the resources 500s gave us, and ignored the meetings/events we didn&#x27;t care about and that weren&#x27;t useful to us.",1394517879

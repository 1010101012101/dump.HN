939534,comment,938564,939526,0,0,sreque,,,"This link is fairly illuminating of clojure's performance: <a href=""http://gnuvince.wordpress.com/2009/05/11/clojure-performance-tips/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnuvince.wordpress.com/2009/05/11/clojure-performance...</a>. A guy writes some Java code, writes some clojure code, and notices that the clojure code is ridiculously slower, about 100 times or more, even slower than his Python implementation! After some serious profiling and help from the clojure mailing list he gets it down to 6 times as slow. What if he decided to try to optimize the Java code even further? He might be even be able to push the gap to 10x.<p>As far as all computers having 60 cores some day, if your clojure code is 10 times slower than my Java code, I only have to use 6 of my 60 cores to be as fast as your clojure program, which would be bringing my 60 core system to it's knees. It's not like you can't parallelize in Java! It's going to be decades indeed before a 5-10x reduction in performance doesn't matter because of ubiquitous core availability.",1258095386

939526,comment,938564,939471,0,0,anonjon,,,"I think that it is difficult to know what constitutes a 'fair benchmark' for Clojure. Are we talking unadorned Clojure, Clojure with type annotations, Clojure using Java structures, or Clojure calling Java code? Clojure calling Java is as fast as Java (obviously). And what if I had 60 cores as opposed to just 4 or 8? Parallel naive Clojure would then be 4 times faster than the Java version. The parallel clever version in Clojure would most likely be much faster. And barring a breakthrough in quantum computing, you will some day have 60+ CPUs in your desktop.<p>Most of the benchmarks that I have seen that were legitimately 10x the time of Java were using unadorned Clojure on Clojure data structures... of course it is slower, the machine is doing a lot more for you.<p>And it is well and good that this is the case, because the purpose of Clojure is not to make that tight loop really fast; it is to get the logic of your program correct and avoid a lot of the subtle bugs that can happen. Concurrency has many advantages above and beyond parallelism.<p>As far as getting along without macros and lazy evaluation and heterogeneous immutable data structures, I will say that for a long time we got along 'just fine' without garbage collection; but now it is a feature of a large subset of languages (to the extent that Google has now added it to C).",1258094955

939523,comment,934456,934456,0,0,10ren,,,"My 100ms Story:<p>100ms. Perceptually, the time it takes for a newline. I was really struck by that. I've felt that waiting for 5 seconds for an ant/java compile was too long (use <i>time ant</i>, like Rob - ant under-reports) but thought I was just being impatient. I mean, it's not enough time to even <i>start</i> a sword-fight. However, hearing Rob Pike (who, by the way, looks <i>way</i> too young to be the C/unix legend from the beginning of time that he is) say <i>100ms was their target for compiles</i> in this talk made me take it seriously.<p>So, I hacked together a ""javac server"", that accepts filenames and compiles them. It doesn't exit between compiles, so it only pays the java-start-up cost once (about 2.5 seconds), and then it drops to about 0.5 a second or so. And then, after a few executions, JIT kicks in, and gradually gets even faster - typically between 100ms and 200ms for a compile (though quite often below the magical 100ms barrier).<p>Bonus 1: In unix, I used <i>rlwrap</i>, which gives you bash-editing features (from readline) to your own programs, and I discovered that the ""-c"" option enables tab-filename-completion! It becomes almost as easy to use as the shell. This made me so happy, I had to clap for joy, <i>rlwrap is amazing.</i> The only lack is no * , ?, [], {a,b} etc.<p>Bonus 2: I made it also run the code. A problem I found was that in Java, a class is only loaded once, so if you recompile the source, and reload it... you still have the first one. The only way to overcome this I found was to create a new classloader each time, that hadn't already loaded that class (a gotcha: be careful that this new classloader does not delegate to classloader that already has loaded that class).<p>Including bonus 2, this gave a combined compile-and-run time average <200ms (about 190ms). Basically negligible. In fact, the first few times I used it, it felt like nothing had happened, and I had to carefully check by deleting the .class file etc... that it really was compiling in that eye-blink. It was amazing. I'll stress this: <i>it is actually</i> faster <i>than just</i> running <i>the code</i>. I found java takes 450ms on average, and now it's running <i>and</i> compiling in 190ms (it's because java also has that startup cost).\nThat is, it's now twice as fast to both compile and run as just running it.<p>The magic I discovered is that there's now no need to have separate text files for input, and the infrastructure of parsing, reading directories, etc. You can play with your code by writing snippets of code, and it feels instant. It feels as responsive as an interpreted language like Python or lisp in a REPL.<p>Going from 5 seconds to <200ms has really made me happy - not just the figures, but the <i>feel</i> of it - and brought more joy into coding. I guess x20 faster is going to have an impact.<p>10ren",1258094789

Despite some people trying to argue to the contrary, fair benchmarks that I've seen put clojure on average at least 10 times slower than Java in CPU performance, and Java itself is often 50% slower than C or more. Why bother parallelizing when you're already 10-15 times slower? CPU's aren't free to run! They have to be purchased, consume power, require maintenance, and are prone to failure.<p>Also, as far as productivity goes, I don't see clojure providing any significant short-term productivity gains over existing scripting languages like Python and Ruby.

If you want people to give you money, for example, I believe it's critical that you get the misspelled versions of the domain. If it costs you $10-15 a year for a domain and you get $10-15 per download, subscription, online listing, etc. from a customer that was redirected from one of the misspelled domains, then the domain is pays for itself and reduces the friction for future sales.<p>The problem is having too many domains. After a while, the price adds up and the overhead isn't worth it, either. I recently transferred a few hundred domains from GoDaddy to another registrar and it literally took half a day to do it. Lock-in sucks.",1258092267

They use Google.  You're going to win on google versus any typosquatter, and most probably versus a competitor who actually makes a bit of an effort.  (To use an example taken totally at random, <a href=""http://www.bingocardscreator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardscreator.com</a> , for example.)<p>However, I do have one bit of domain buying advice: own the big three (com/net/org) for <i>anything</i> you register.  Aaron Wall has waxed eloquently on this topic before, so you can read it on his blog, but exact match domains have an <i>insane</i> boost associated with them currently on Google and if you exactly match the search query you can get to the top of the rankings by sneezing.",1258092078

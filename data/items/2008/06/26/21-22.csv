229158,comment,229103,229103,0,0,kirse,,,"Is there any reason why Clickpass is _better_ than the solution of choosing a base password and then simply modifying that based on the websites I visit?<p>For example, ""computer"" is my base password, and for [f]aceboo[k] it would be ""computer-fk"".  This isn't how I do it, of course, but it's a similar process that only requires me to memorize one password and take 5 extra seconds to tack on any additional characters.<p>If someone can justify the number of privacy issues -- and let's be honest here, any determined and skilled hacker WILL compromise these high-value systems -- over my few extra seconds I will glady sign up for Clickpass.<p>Edit: And just to clarify, I'm not trying to knock Clickpass here, I'm seriously asking about what is the real benefit of this system over mine.",1214517141

He thought it was too important. It was a job that would be poorly done if left to the authorities religious, political, or scientific. Just like good hackers know software is too important to leave to someone else.<p>Gandhi also made it obvious that I could apply a rigid filter to books. Read authors who, 1. Reason soundly with the reader, and 2. Have led significantly, uncommonly, fruitful lives. The sample size of humanity seems to have gotten large enough to where you can find someone who meets both criteria so I'm done settling for less.<p>I like the brand of epistemology that says, variously, that the more true things you believe, the better you can harmonize with, hack, pwn, reality. So I perk up now when I find someone peacefully liberating a country or figuring out how to do a startup while 'being good,' and hope that they've written about it.<p>So if you'd like to read a book by a social, physical, and metaphysical scientist, who (judging from what he accomplished) collected a lot of knowledge and hacked the system good, read this book.<p>But don't take my word for it.",1214516588

The mitigating factor here is that Prometheus' observation:<p><i>Actually, doesn't the existence of TLDs seem arbitrary, too? Why end every URL with .SomeString?</i><p>...is a pretty good description of the <i>de facto</i> situation today. Basically, there is only one important TLD - .com - and both surfers and browsers are happy to pretend that it's unnecessary. If you own a domain with any other TLD, it requires people to remember a meaningless suffix, and/or the placement of a meaningless dot inside your name. (""deli.cious? del.ic.ious? delic.io.us? What the hell was that, again?"") The result is marketing poison, and nobody recommends it.<p>This ICANN decision is bad, but I think the main effect will be to <i>further</i> amplify the value of .com domains (the ones which don't require you to remember a <i>now entirely arbitrary</i> TLD).

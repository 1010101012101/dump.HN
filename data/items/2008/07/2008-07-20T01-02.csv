But, it's still a great list.<p>I also think the idea of measuring and comparing complexity should be included. Even though this is arguably a pure math problem... A software startup will likely be involved because 1) any useful implementation will likely be software based 2) It'll be useful to most businesses in the world 3) most hackers know math.<p>[edit: wording]",1216518975

The wide range of ideas presented in this write up show how diverse the problems on the web are, which presents plenty of opportunities for startups to fix them.  #12 particularly stood out to me.  I think that with the direction a lot of the resulting startups will take, new ways of advertising should follow.  This one of the areas where theres room to innovate the most, because theres more to advertising on the web than ""ads by goooooooogle"".",1216518112

251042,story,,,1,0,tss,"Ask HN: Do Companies Tie Digital and Physical Security Together?",,"This is a question for those with industry experience out there.<p>I imagine that major companies today are concerned about their computer security.  From my understanding, it is not unrealistic for a company to higher a contractor to audit and/or overhaul existing security.  What I am curious about is if companies worry about the physical security of their data as well.  Do they rely on their computer security guys to give them advice?  I would think that the people who would be most aware of the physical security needed to complement whatever computer security exists would be the people responsible the digital security measures.  Or are these two aspects of security usually handled by two different entities?",1216517826

I think an approach to beat procrastination is to ""accept"" it. If I know I spend generally an hour surfing the web for every two hours of work, then I will start working on a project sooner if I can. I guess this can be called a ""know thyself"" approach.",1216517314
251037,comment,250670,250784,0,0,Zev,,,"Public school isn't irrelevant.  It just needs to be updated a bit.  The gap between how the current generation (people born post 1980 or so) and people born before before that is <i>huge</i>.  And now we're starting to get teachers who grew up in the 1980's and soon, the 90's.  Having teachers that know how to relate to kids will do more to keep them interested then any change in the curriculum can do.<p>Because, fundamentally, the curricula is solid - Math doesn't change that often, Physics/Chemistry/Biology/Earth Sciences are well established fields.  History is ongoing, but given what High School history classes focus on, it's not going to change much.  English/Literature isn't going to change an incredible amount - new books can be added in, but Shakespeare's words haven't changed since he wrote them.  Writing styles may come and go, but thats just a small part of everything learned in HS.",1216516999
251036,comment,250930,250930,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is an interesting question. I think the main reason is time -- universities only have so much time. But yet these were major icons on the world stage: surely some classroom time should be given to them.<p>As another possibility, it may be the way humans think of science that is at issue. If we believe that science is always progressing forward towards some idealistic picture of reality and that exceptions are rare, what's the point in studying old dead guys who were obviously wrong? If, however, we believe that science is always progressing forward towards some idealistic picuter of reality and that exceptions are NOT rare, then we should pay attention to each little turn in the road we took -- we may have to go back to there.<p>I hear a lot of Marx in the political arena -- lots of times by people who have no idea they are channeling him. It might be useful for our universities to at least provide students with a good background on Karl. Likewise, to fail to understand historicism and the dialectic of the spiritis to miss out on some great ideas -- even if Marx took those ideas way too far later on.",1216516869
251034,comment,250944,250944,0,0,webwright,,,"Well, whatever split you take-- you'll have a vesting period (2-4 years).  So, another way to look at it is this:<p>After 4 years (or whatever the vesting period is), how much of a discrepancy will there be between the total value you've created and the total value he has created?  How much discrepancy will there be in risks you've taken and the salaries you've missed?  With your 3 month head start, that'd be 51 man-months vs. his 48 man-months.<p>At the end of the day, there's no formula here, and you trying to calculate in assorted risks and values really isn't going to come up with an correct number-- all it's going to do is give you a feeling that you went thru appropriate motions.<p>But, I can say that 99 times out of a hundred, the first 3 man months of a business are really not the most critical months...  And it honestly sounds like you're over-estimating the value you've created and the risks you've eliminated.<p>Also, from the way you're describing it-- you're not looking to bring this guy on as a partner or co-founder-- you're describing a decidedly non-partner relationship. It sounds more like you're looking for someone who walks and talks like an employee, but is happy to take no salary and a minority stake.<p>You really haven't eliminated that much risk, though you've clearly accomplished a good amount in 3 months...  But you really don't even know what sort of business you're creating yet and whether the market wants it.<p>I'd go 55-45 or 60-40 with each of you having a 4 year vesting period (yours could have a 1 year acceleration due to your head start).",1216516672

251028,comment,250797,250797,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"My first thought was that putting the sensor/ball in the middle means the mouse is less sensitive to the way in which you hold it. That would mean that if you hold the mouse at a slight angle, it would still behave the same as if you hold it straight on. If you put the sensor in the front, the mouse becomes more sensitive to its orientation, but it limits the different ways in which you can hold the mouse since you must hold it straight on for it to behave the same.",1216515862

Even condensation can bridge it, which is the theory why mine exploded.</i><p>What environment are you using your laptop in that's allowing condensation to form inside the device?  Electronics are typically not rated for use in condensing environments at all.<p>Air gaps as insulators are pretty typical in electronics.  That's how it works in every desktop machine I've ever used.  And it looks like the air gap inside the MBP is plenty large, and even if it weren't, the attached components would be making contact with the case, not the board itself.<p><a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2009+Teardown/814/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+M...</a><p>I think the ""condensation inside the case"" theory is incorrect.  I don't know if that's your own theory or if someone working for Apple told you that, but I don't see that as feasible.  You'd need a lot of liquid inside the case for a short to involve the case.  And frankly, if you've got <i>any</i> liquid inside your laptop, the fact that the case is metal is irrelevant.<p>> <i>Regarding appearance, and? Does that really matter?</i><p>Of course not.  No one cares about the way their $1300 device looks any more.  As a society, we moved past caring about appearances in 1992.",1354553915

4866361,comment,4863451,4866155,2,0,viscanti,,,"The ""approved meter that others were required to use"" was for taxis, not limo/towncars.  Their GPS units are significantly less opaque than the status quo for limos (which really comes down to just naming an arbitrary price, or having to pay for a full hour regardless of use).  In the Boston case, a lower level regulator with ties to the taxi industry issued the cease and desist, it was his supervisor who removed it, because there was in-fact a basis for using GPS to track time/distance.<p>Why should Uber ask for permission to run a legal business?  The city of Boston agrees that their business is legal, and that GPS is OK.  They're using commercially licensed drivers with commercial insurance, leveraging a system that existed well before Uber.  They're simply making it more efficient for both sides (fill spare capacity with riders who need a car).  Their drivers and cars meet all local regulations.  Their outspoken opponents aren't doing so for the public good, they're doing it because they represent an entrenched power who is threatened.

I mean, maybe not, right? If so, then you'd have to have gotten that money through someone else doing what Google is doing right? Why not just switch to them if Google does you dirty?<p>The underlying point here is that you are not Google's customer -- the advertiser is -- and it's in your, Google's, and the advertiser's best interest to treat the advertiser better than they treat you. Otherwise, the customer is going to go to another network that doesn't let fraudsters game them out of click fees.<p>How many articles have we seen about Facebook doing exactly that? That's much worse IMO. If I'm <i>giving</i> you money, you better be taking it legitimately. If I'm taking your money, the onus is on me to prove I have taken it honestly. If not, I'd totally expect Google to keep the money -- and they don't keep the money -- they give it back to the advertiser or never charge them to begin with.<p>If you or the other people around here were to keep the money an advertiser gave you and then complained about being fraudulent -- even if it wasn't -- then you'd soon be faced with tons of articles saying ""They kept my money even though bots were clicking!!""<p>And you'd soon be out of business because no one would give you any money.<p>Google is making the right decisions here.

The tile sizes in WP8 are user-customizable. Examples from my phone:<p>- My email tiles are the smallest (1x) size because they still show unseen count at that size (also shown on the lock screen), which is the only ""live"" information I care about for them. At 4x they will show the name of the email account (which I don't need, since I can tell by the icon) and at 8x they show the subject line of the most recently received email, which I don't personally care for.<p>- Same goes for my phone and messaging tiles, as well as IE and maps, which have no live functionality<p>- I use a 4x tile for my calendar for two reasons: 1) I've put it in the top corner of the screen, and 4x makes it easier to reach if I want to open the calendar app, and 2) at 4x it shows the day, date and next calendar appointment (also shown on the lock screen, but I like it here as well).<p>- The pinned-contact tile for my wife is 4x because the vast majority of communication I do on the phone is with her, and because I like seeing her picture there. Plus, at 4x, it shows Facebook status updates and sometimes other stuff.<p>- I keep the Weather Channel tile at 4x because it shows today's forecast.<p>- Pinned websites are all 1x, because they don't update and I can tell from even small icons what they are.<p>- A few other apps that I use (I personally don't use a lot of apps except the stock ones) are pinned at 1x, since they don't have any live functionality I really care for.<p>I've always thought the ""live tile"" idea was a bit oversold since in the majority of cases I don't really find it useful (I don't really count things like email unseen counts as live tiles - even if WP8 didn't have live tiles I would still expect that information to be there, like it is in iOS), but the new WP8 ads about being able to really make it ""your"" phone definitely ring true. If I had other apps, workflows or priorities it would look completely different.<p>disclosure: works for MSFT.",1354553545

It may even make you feel that you've made progress towards understanding what the parent comment was about, without actually spending the required amount of time on it. Topics on HN obviously have a strong bias towards solid intellectual content (and I don't necessarily mean academic topics), so it's probably unlikely that much insight can be gained from very short comments - unless the poster is particularly observant and skilled in condensing information, of course.<p>That's just one of the reasons why I'm sceptical about karma.

The quote you provided is what courts are <i>supposed</i> to do. The fact that they don't do it in other cases is more of an attestation to the lack of justice available to those accused who lack economic and political power than to anything wrong with what they do with tax law.<p>The real trouble is that profit-based tax accounting is highly subjective. If it costs you $90 to provide a service that you sell for $100 then you're supposed to pay tax on the $10 of profit. But things only cost what you pay for them. If you're selling for $100 and buying your raw materials from a corporate sibling in a lower tax jurisdiction, what is the ""cost"" of those materials? The customers are willing to pay about $100 for them; that seems like a reasonable total for the sum of your costs -- if you were making anything more then your powerful multinational supplier/franchisor could squeeze it out of you if you were independent, so the same goes for you as a subsidiary.<p>Take an example: Suppose you're a franchisee who owns a coffee shop. You have to pay Multinational, Inc. to use their trademark and fly you to their location to get some training. They're in Ireland (or whatever) and pay tax on that money there. By the time you pay them and pay your employees and rent and utilities and all that, you have just enough to pay your own salary. Then you have nothing left as taxable income for Starbucks on Third Street, Inc., but that's perfectly alright with you because you're happy to be making a steady salary, so indefinite corporate break-even is a stable equilibrium.<p>If Starbucks International then comes in and offers to buy your franchise, it makes no sense for that to change your now-subsidiary's corporate tax liability. And if it did, it just wouldn't happen -- instead of having subsidiaries they would continue to have franchisees ""owned"" by managers who make no more from the franchise than they could be expected to draw as salary from the manager position.<p>They call this problem ""transfer pricing"" -- you get to deduct costs from taxable income, and you get to decide (within reason) how much your costs are. But when profit margins are thin, a (very reasonable) couple of percentage points difference in the cost paid to a corporate sibling can easily erase all of your in-country profits.<p>I haven't heard anyone come up with a reasonable solution to it, other than to stop trying to tax profit and tax something else instead.",1354551649

But I do question whether or not it has any <i>particular</i> value which exceeds any of the innumerable other works I could read with that time instead.<p>Of course that might lead you ask ""then why are you planning to read it""?  To which I can only say ""because it sounds interesting and exactly because I haven't read much Russian literature and I want to broaden my horizons a bit"".  But I'm not reading it because I want to be able to impress some hipster pseudo-intellectuals, or because it's something you're ""supposed"" to read.  I just want to see what it's all about.  Same with <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, which I started recently (but got distracted from and set aside temporarily).<p><i>Mostly I would read Tolstoy for the same reason I would read Nietzsche - to break through our regrettable tendency to take the past and its people for granted.</i><p>I agree with that, but I find that fiction from (and set in) Victorian era England has been my primary outlet for thinking about and appreciating the past in that regard.  That's certainly not to discredit the Russian stuff you speak of, just saying that reading Tolstoy or Dostoevsky or whatever, isn't the only way to tap into that historical perspective.<p><i>It's one thing to read about the ideas Nietzsche developed on a Wikipedia article, it's wholly another to read him in his own words and suddenly find yourself thrust into contact with a whole mind, a living, breathing bundle of thoughts and anxieties and dream, a human being palpably aching to find meaning, caught in the middle of one of the greatest social upheavals of human history.</i><p>Indeed.  I greatly enjoyed reading Nietzsche's <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> and have quite a few of his other works on my list.",1354551323

How is that not playing by the same rules as everyone else?<p>Cab dispatch companies work in all the cities Uber is in, and Uber meets exactly the same regulations those companies do.  Should Uber double drug test drivers?  Should they double inspect vehicles for emissions?  Or are we OK with knowing that all their drivers are already in compliance with all local regulations in each city?  I guess I don't see what regulations they're skirting, or why there's a need for more regulation now.

Until then, I applaud them for learning (or appearing to), and don't fault them for not breaking non-existent regulations (they're following all local regulations in each city, and shouldn't need to ask for permission to run a legal business there).

I'll try to answer it but it's very difficult as there's really no historical precedent for this kind of situation.<p>- Ireland ditching it's debts and leaving the EU are mutually exclusive. Ireland could technically renege on it's obligations and still remain an EU member (the EU has no formal mechanism for the exit of a member, believe it or not, so we couldn't be forced to leave. Hence some of the confusion over Greece's future EU status.) There is a 'troika' of institutions overseeing Ireland's bailout program - the ECB (european central bank), EC (european commission) and IMF - and they do not all speak with the same voice. The IMF was of the opinion that Ireland should be given more of a debt 'haircut' to make the debt more sustainable. That opinion was rejected by the Irish government strangely (I believe the government doesn't want to look bad to Germany, who are effectively paying the bills, hence ""the Irish government being europe's little bitches"" comment). I think action will be forced eventually, the debt is completely weighing down the economy and the situation can't continue. The Irish government actually has the power to unilaterally renege on the debt, but they're scared to do so. The phrase used by cowardly Irish government officials and Eurocrats is that ""the economic bomb won't go off in Frankfurt, it will go off in Dublin"" if Ireland suspends debt repayments.<p>- There is zero political will to actually leave the EU. There are some economists saying that Ireland's best option would be to leave the EU (<a href=""http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/david-mcwilliams-leaving-the-euro-may-be-our-least-extreme-option-2973716.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliam...</a>). The Irish business community is quite conservative and would be dead against leaving the EU. Any political party that suggested this would be committing political suicide.<p>- There is historical precedent for countries writing down sovereign debt and then growing quickly once feed from the shackles of debt - Argentina is one example. How much it would impact US companies' willingness to invest in Ireland if Ireland a) wrote off some/all bank debt b) left the EU or c) both, is very hard to say. On the one hand, leaving the EU would mean returning to the old Irish pound, meaning a currency devaluation is once again possible - making the country more competitive internationally, boosting exports. We wouldn't have to listen to the French Government moaning about Ireland's low tax status (France has an official corporation tax rate, then the effective rate which companies actually pay, which I believe is lower than Ireland's tax rate). A debt write down would mean no more idiotic wasting of tax revenue into the black hole of our banks. However on the other hand, for a small country to receive such a negative credit downgrade could make matters dramatically worse in the short-term, potentially leading to serious political upheaval. Transaction costs would be increased as companies have to convert Irish pounds into Euros when selling into Europe.<p>This is a long-winded way of saying it's complicated, no historical precent, so I'm just speculating at best.",1354551234

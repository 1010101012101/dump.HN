The article just triggered the question, I wasn't necessarily commenting on the technology.<p>> <i>At a global scale, the ""rains out of the atmosphere"" bit mostly covers it. Condensation and evaporation processes tend to make water vapor largely self-regulating, shifting around quantities of water that dwarf human factors.</i><p>I was thinking more on a local level. I realize that water vapor will dump out of the atmosphere (unlike CO2) so it for the most part will not be a greenhouse gas. My question was on whether or not large amounts of water vapor being released from cars will cause local ecosystem changes. (i.e. If every vehicle in NYC or Los Angeles ran on hydrogen, would it cause average rainfall in the immediate or surrounding areas to increase? What about yearly average ratio of cloudy vs sunny days?) Obviously people in middle-America (for example) probably won't cause much of a local impact, but what about major urban centers?",1265947004

Write javascript prototypes to mimic the primatives of BASIC where there is no JS equivalent - Arrays spring to mind, JS Arrays are dynamical growing sparse arrays.

Walk the AST recursively emitting Javascript equivalents (ie fragments of code) of the BASIC constructs.<p>4. Pass that javascript to eval or load it as an external JS file.<p>The two languages are fairly similar in broad details. subs and functions both become functions, depending on the dialect of BASIC you are implementing you wont need to implement classes, maybe only types.

You're always going to be able to dismiss part of the problem as ""too hard"" to bother addressing, that way. I used to feel that way myself. It's convenient, but it's also not true.<p>The truth is that people are learning constantly whether they want to or not. It's what humans <i>do</i>. We take input from the world and turn it into cognitive models of the world. The only question is what input and how accurate the model is--things which the designer of a thing can always influence.<p>What you're seeing when you see laziness is people who have developed a cognitive model of computers (or whatever) that involves a lot of pain and confusion relative to the reward. Some of this is just absorbed from the surrounding culture, but much of it is gleaned from their actual experience in using them. They have <i>learned</i> that learning about the computer = pain, and that's what they avoid. A common element of that pain is feeling stupid and lazy for not yet understanding. (After all, that's what people who <i>do</i> understand computers keep telling you.) But who can blame a person for avoiding painful experiences?<p>Learning always involves at least a trace of confusion, but it doesn't have to be painful in a way that people want to avoid in spite of the rewards. Eliminate the unnecessary pain from these experiences and you'll find that ""laziness"" seems to disappear along with it.",1265944636

The exception is where you use expertise that is directly related to your job duties to come up with a better way of doing things in the very area in which your employer competes. Common sense suggests why that should be an exception: if the rule were otherwise, any employee could basically claim job-related inventions as his own.<p>If you have already left employment, and have not yet developed anything, then you should normally have little risk of having your ideas being deemed to belong to your employer. It is normally virtually impossible for an employer, for example, to prove that you were still employed ""at the time of conception or reduction to practice"" of your idea, as opposed to afterward.  Two important exceptions to watch out for on this point: (1) if you file a patent application shortly after leaving employment relating to your employer's field, this is like waving a red flag in your employer's face that you had conceived the invention while employed; and (2) some assignment-of-invention agreements set forth a rebuttable presumption that any invention you develop within x period of leaving employment is presumed to have been conceived while still employed, and the legal effect of this sort of clause is to treat such an invention as belonging to your employer unless you can affirmatively prove otherwise (an often impossible task).",1265944014

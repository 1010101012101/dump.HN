The home button is web convention, and the purpose of your article was to me somewhat confusing. <p>I was under the impression that it is in bad taste to submit your own articles to social sites like news.yc, reddit, and Digg. It appears that you submit every single article you write. (And some, honestly, are good-- far better than this one.)",1192578970

All<i> of them do maintain circadian cycles to cope with the much faster and more dramatic day/night cycle.<p></i>Or most? I know the cyanobacteria do and I'm pretty sure the purple bacteria do. The bacteriorhodopsin-users might not. If you call that photosynthesis.",1192578945

It's a detection based on a wiggle that means the model says there's a world where the model says it would be mostly rocky where the model says....<p>\nI guess I can stop painting those ""Welcome E.T."" signs now.",1192578599

This allows you to fit models to data, to see how the planet-hunting game is played.<p>The planet was found by repeatedly observing the same star over and over, and measuring how fast the star is moving away or towards us.  This wiggle is produced by the motion of planets.  It's really small.  Currently the best team (full disclosure: one of my advisors is on it) can measure velocities of 30 centimeter per second.

68806,comment,68563,68758,0,0,geebee,,,"where did we come from?  The explanation I can piece together through memory is that we most likely come from organic matter that (though processes that are not yet well understood) formed the basis for cellular life.   Random mutation and natural selection over hundreds of millions of years led to the speciation that includes homo sapiens.  <p>I'm not sure that finding life on another planet would change the science much.  Maybe there would be some connection, maybe not - they could be parallel processes, or maybe some kind of seeding function took place.  <p>Either way, it would still be immensely satisfying discovery, one of the greatest ever.

68802,comment,68759,68759,0,0,queensnake,,,"I think it is, but this post doesn't touch on it deeply enough. For instance, I like OO's 'object.operation' syntax; mentally it's usually closest to how your brain seems to want to 'unload' itself of the tension of what you're wanting to say / do. It's the 'topic, comment' structure - considered lazy and weak (I believe) in human languages, but easy. Also, not syntax, but I like Ruby's habit of returning 'self', allows for things like 'foos.fold().spindle().mutilate()' - it rolls off the fingers. ",1192576782

68793,comment,68563,68693,0,0,icey,,,"There's a fairly easy example of how this can go bad here on earth. Cats and dogs don't innately hate each other, but everyone knows how they get on. <p>The problem is that cats and dogs have opposing body language; when a dog acts excited and happy, the cat interprets that language as aggression. For example, a cat with its ears down and tail wagging is a cat that's about to fight. A dog doing the same thing is being submissive. <p>Of course, this all assumes that any intelligent extra-terrestrial life even has any sort of body language or capability to communicate that we can even recognize.

More importantly, the quality of the investors in Silicon Valley is likely higher since they have more experience with them and have more connections that could help your company in the future.<p>I don't think there's any way to compare investors in Silicon Valley with those in other areas without the Silicon Valley investors coming out on top.",1192575771

This can&#x27;t be &quot;backed up&quot; in the traditional sense because it&#x27;s impossible, barring custom hardware/great expense, to take a consistent snapshot of a multi-TB dataset distributed across dozens of machines.

My comment was directed more towards people like the author of the OP who are rich and do no work. That being said rich people cannot contribute anything more to the economy other than what they can produce with their own physical and mental labor. This is a fundamental limit, that is set by the laws of the physical world. Yet, paradoxically, the wealth of the super rich skyrockets past this limit.<p>This is because the capital they deploy into the world isn&#x27;t generated by them. It&#x27;s generated by the labor of the corporations they own. A corporation is composed of employees and this is the true origin of capital. The money rich people deploy and churn into the economy is capital &quot;owned&quot; by rich people the same way landlords &quot;own&quot;, &quot;redeploy&quot; and charge rent on land; If you disagree, note that in the english language land and corporations are both referred to as capital.",1432227493

My mistake for not making that clear. There are certainly many rich people who work hard. Despite that, this does not mean that hard working rich people deserve their wealth... Onward:<p>>But when you look at modern American billionaires like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, they made their fortune by working intensely hard and smart in very competitive markets, and inventing or making available to the mass-market products that created billions of dollars in value. It can definitely be argued that a single individual can create billions of dollars of new wealth, and not on the &quot;back&quot; of others - there&#x27;s a lot of very wealthy early Microsoft and Apple employees out there, and billions of dollars of value created for its customers over the last couple decades.<p>I disagree. Those innovative mass market products may be created under the leadership of one hard working man, but it is fundamentally impossible for a complex product like the iphone to be entirely the work of one man. The iphone, the boeing 747, and many other complex projects can only be built with the expertise and labor of multitudes of people.

If there is a problem, it will tell me which days are missing.<p>Manual Portion: Once every couple months, I backup the portion of my /home directory that is not heavy media like video to a large USB stick, which I keep at my office.<p>I don&#x27;t love this setup, particularly because (1) an offsite backup does not happen automatically, (2) my video is not backed up offsite, and (3) it is not resilient to natural disasters in my area, since both my home and office are within a half-mile of each other in downtown New York City.<p>Moreover, because I keep my NAS mounted even when no backup is in progress, my backups are vulnerable to malicious code executed even at the non-superuser level.

9583857,comment,9576313,9579624,0,0,derptacious,,,"Great analysis. Is there even a theory of what causes randomness? Where does it come from? Why should we believe it is discrete from &quot;unpredictability?&quot; Even in random number generators, the game is about pulling from widely unpredictable sources to generate entropy - the word &quot;random&quot; should maybe be a misnomer.
I&#x27;ve never believed in anything besides unpredictability in various scopes of systems. By scopes of systems, I mean, in some contexts of analysis it makes sense to deem a system temporarily closed to analyze certain parts of it. For example, the earth is not a closed system, but for some discussions and analysis it makes sense to simply treat it like one.<p>I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard for this description - or paradigm - to proliferate to the masses and various pop writers. Writers so often are tying human consciousness to QM experimentation as if it were something special. The fact of the matter is: in each QM experiment the only things really interacting with the experiment are the atoms of the measurement apparatuses, sensors, and whatnot. In the case of the double slit experiment, we could have them &quot;interpreted&quot; automatically - and say, kill a cat if an interference pattern is created and not kill it if one is not made. Making the discussion about consciousness is a distraction from the core issues.",1432226860

You would have to charge it twice in a week, at most. Mostly I ended up charging it once/week. It would actually run longer with low battery warning than today&#x27;s most smartphones&#x27; whole charge cycle.<p>2. It was convenient to hold, small enough to lose in any kind of pockets. At least I never had to take the phone in to account when buying pants, which I need to do now, for smartphones.<p>3. The phone would last forever, only you would have to change the battery in every two years.<p>4. It was rock solid. You could use it as alternative to stone to hit something.<p>5.

Even if you don&#x27;t have concurrency to worry about, it still has to be incremental - meaning to do its work in small batches and provide a guarantee that the process doesn&#x27;t get blocked for more than X millis.<p>Also, if you can rely on the data-structures stored in your heap to be persistent, then you can tune the GC for it. The problem is that you need to make assumptions about the life-cycle of those data-structures. For example, the persistent data-structures being used in Scala or Clojure can be pretty heavy for the JVM&#x27;s garbage collectors because they tend to produce junk that is neither short-term or long-term, thus invalidating the assumptions with which the JVM was built with. And generally that&#x27;s OK, because the JVM&#x27;s GCs can cope pretty well and if the need to optimize arises, well both Scala and Clojure are hybrids (just like OCaml), so you can just use mutable stuff if by profiling you see problems. So the theory is known and a decent concurrent GC can be built.",1432226116

Anyone concerned with the &quot;ought&quot; does not confuse it with the &quot;is&quot;, and therefore any scientific description of human society can only be temporary and certainly not normative. If anything, this view is even more associated with opponents of the Enlightenment than with its proponents. The only way the philosopher will be out of a job is if people confine themselves to the notion that society cannot be changed and there&#x27;s nothing we can aspire to. Since the entire history of the human race empirically disproves this notion (and shows that the chance of people resigning themselves to this idea is very low), the philosopher is unlikely to lose his job.

My experience is that these motorcycles often dart between cars causing drivers to swerve slightly and tap their brakes.<p>I would argue this makes congestion worse as it causes more cautious drivers to brake (sometimes abruptly) and almost always slow down.<p>Finally, it is important to consider that as a vehicle, most of us are not looking for you and make small changes from left to right while in our lanes. It is not a goal of mine to accommodate motorcycle riders while driving. Splitter beware.<p>I&#x27;m all for sharing the road-- be we all need to subject to the same rules.",1432224170

If you want to be paid for writing software, then doing it on your own time and contributing to an MIT licensed project is NOT the way to go.<p>On the other hand, if your goal is to have your software used by as many people as possible, then MIT licensed may be the way to go. In my case, the piece of software that I wrote that runs in the most places (measured in the billions) is probably the IJG JPEG library that was very liberally licensed and consequently found its way into all sorts of devices...

9583590,comment,9582997,9582997,0,0,davismwfl,,,"AWS currently and for the last ~4 years.  We have also placed more than a dozen clients into AWS.<p>We have used SoftLayer, Peak10, Google and Azure at different times while testing things out.  SoftLayer we actually ran some processes in for about a year.<p>I recently had posted on HN about services like DigitalOcean because there are ways for us to save money using those types of services, or even  Heroku.  In the end the ecosystem, ease of use, reliability (when architected right) and flexibility of AWS is still just too powerful for us.  The costs are not the cheapest way we could do something, but when you factor in the minimal amount of man hours we spend on infrastructure compared to what we could be, I think it is a good deal.  We try not to get too ingrained to AWS only features, and where we do we will hide their implementation so we can switch them out if ever needed.  I also classify them differently too, for example, DynamoDB or MySQL (via RDS) wouldn&#x27;t be something I&#x27;d try to wrap, it is your database and could be used from anywhere so you aren&#x27;t really locked into AWS as much as your database there.  But something like SQS, we used but wrapped, and eventually moved to RabbitMQ with very little extra effort.<p>I have had to use AWS support a few times, and they have been AMAZINGLY helpful.  And for non-critical things they usually answer forum posts pretty quick too.  AWS isn&#x27;t a panacea with no issues, but for my money its the best thing going right now.  And they are constantly releasing new things and tweaking things, not everything is for the better, but for the most part it is.",1432224136

In the first of the trilogy, Horace discussed the origins of Asymco.com and also why he has used Apple as the lens to understand innovation and technology disruption. We also traced back to other Apple-like companies in the past such as Sony in Asia, and look at how Apple and Pixar has displayed a different kind of “DNA” against innovative companies in the past.

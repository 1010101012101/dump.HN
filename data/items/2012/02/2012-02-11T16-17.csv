3579553,comment,3578807,3578807,1,0,jmilloy,,,"This isn't really what I think of as the Socratic method, which pertains to a style of discourse (whether it be teacher-student or peer-peer) involving questions by one side and answers by the other to investigate nonfactual issues, and which attempts to keep the discourse grounded in solid reasoning.<p>Of course, eliciting information from students, regardless of what you call it, is a well known and essential aspect of <i>any</i> good lesson plan. It is a real challenge to ask the right questions and stick with it when students aren't making the discoveries you want, and it's tremendously rewarding when it works. But it's not the whole story, and I think it's tempting to get excited when it works and lose sight of the longterm goals for you students. For many topics, it must be followed at some point with practice, and a LOT of it. It can leave some students totally behind. In fact, it's actually still quite teacher-centric, and should be used in short segments and (when possible) replaced by student-centric activities.",1328979127
3579552,comment,3579207,3579207,5,0,nirvana,,,"I wonder if it isn't a good time in the webs evolution to come up with or popularize a theme standard, and if bootstrap isn't a good step in that direction.  This might help accelerate adoption and popularity of themes, especially open sourced themes, saving everyone a lot of time.  This is the kind of thing I don't feel proprietary about at all, and would rather share my designs with others to improve and extend than re-create the wheel.<p>I'm working on a web application platform (coffeescript running concurrently across a cluster of nodes, basically).  I'm still working on the backend, but once it is released publicly, I want to start building out a built-in frontend.  To that goal, I'm planning to ship a web framework built in, and Bootstrap is the leading candidate right now.<p>I know popularly you buy themes which are collections of HTML and CSS and that they make it easy to have a nice layout without having to swipe a 37signals page-- you just change the content to suit what you want.<p>I see bootstrap coming from one end- a cohesive framework to make developing pages easier-- and themes being going a step further-- specific designs for everything but the content.<p>And I wonder if it wouldn't be a good idea to have a sort of theme architecture for bootstrap.<p>What I'm imagining is that themes could be specified, and developed in such a way that they could be traded as tar balls and quickly and easily used by projects.  Much the way wordpress themes are standardized and plug into wordpress, these themes could be standardized and plug into bootstrap.  Hell, the bootstrap page has an almost theme creator that lets you customize bootstrap. (<a href=""http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/download.html</a>)<p>I'd love to have the ability to point my web platform at a github page, and have it suck in the latest version of an open source theme for people.<p>I'd love it if themes became a popular open source item.  You may think this is a bad idea, but I see it as taking the framework idea and building another level on top of it.  Sure, some people will just use stock themes, others will make custom themes.<p>... and a lot of people will learn web design by taking apart themes and understanding them.<p>Does a standard format for bootstrap themes make sense?<p>(Please don't flame me if I've missed something here- this is an idea, and I admit to not being a bootstrap expert.)",1328979123

Within an hour or two it became obvious that the appeal to the crowd didn't work so well, as some people will understand the concept faster than others.  As a result, we went around to each student.  However, this did result in sometimes trying to get an individual student to say the ""correct"" thing in order to follow to the next sequence of questions.  People were put on the spot, which isn't necessarily bad.  Also the class moved as slow as the slowest person and it took a whole lot of preparation by the professor.  We had about 20 people, and at that scale it wasn't necessary to concentrate on each question, but only to the general topic.  Even at that scale the method was breaking down, both from previous reasons as well as introducing a small amount of ""stage fright"".  However, everyone left the class knowing what was taught, with a minimum of confusion along the way.",1328978853

I believe where Tcl ""went wrong"" is that it never got attached to a very high profile use case or project.<p>It is not enough that the language was open source-- it needed to be used in a major open source product (or a major product period, the way flash is major, and thus ensured a life for lingo/actionscript, etc.)   There was no Rails for Tcl like there was for Ruby.  There was no Django like there was for python.  There was no iPhone like there is for iOS, or massive number of open popular open source products like there is for Java.<p>I can barely remember anything of Tcl.  It didn't make a big impression on me, even though I wrote it full time for a couple years at a job back in the day.<p>This is not true of other languages- Every language I've had to use full time has become my favorite language.  At one point it was Java, then I discovered Objective-C and that became my favorite language, then I got into erlang, and now <i>that</i> is my favorite language (though it shares a spot with Obj-C because I use them for different things.)  Tcl never made a big impression- it never gave me the big epiphany of a better way to do something that the other languages have (message passing in Objective-C makes it the best OO language in my opinion, and erlang's concurrency is unmatched, in my experience, though I don't claim to be an expert.)<p>Finally, the big claim to fame that Tcl had, was TK.  Tcl programmers talk about TK a lot- notice how this article does.  Unfortunately, the problem TK is trying to solve is essentially unsolvable in a good way.  Sure, you can make a cross platform GUI toolkit, many have, but you then have to decide if you make your program look the same on each platform (and thus not like that platform) or if you try to make it look like the platform, in which case you run into all kinds of issues (because each GUI platform is based on seriously different design choices and thus having one bit of code support contradictory design choices on the different platforms is difficult.  You can abstract a lot of it, but not all of it.)  In the end, these cross platform apps never quite look right.  Perfectly fine for Enterprise software (part of the reason Java found such success there) but never really delivering for the commercial shrink-wrapped market, which needed each platform app to look just right for that platform.<p>The two big lessons I take away from this for any open source project is-\n1. Have a clear compelling feature that you absolutely nail.  Be the go-to place for that feature (as TK tried to be.)<p>2. Do everything you can to make sure there's some high visibility adoptions of your project in other projects or products.",1328978071

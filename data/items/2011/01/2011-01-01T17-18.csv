2057951,comment,2057633,2057882,0,0,jerf,,,"""Having said that though, I feel that the situation is slowly changing in recent years""<p>You have to be careful when comparing the US to the rest of the world, because the US is the one breaking the ground of new levels of relatively-well-distributed wealth. (Put aside the question of how well for a moment, please.) For instance, it turns out that the US did not have uniquely bad dietary habits around flour and sugar, it's just that the US was the first to discover people really like to eat that crap and could afford the infrastructure to deploy it; now the bad diets and the consequences are spreading like wildfire as the requisite level of wealth is spreading. (dhughes says Canada is there too, certainly they have that level of wealth too.)<p>Correspondingly, it is hard to know whether the rest of the world cooks their own meals and don't eat out much because of some sort of intrinsic betterness or culture, or because they simply can't afford it yet. Once people can afford it in more places they may be more inclined to eat out. And if they do, they'll start losing the ability to cook overall. Culture may induce some lag but there's no particularly compelling reason to think that more countries won't follow along.",1293904484

He wrote about how he began Googleing for information…and Googleing…and Googleing. He couldn’t make head or tail of the results. Paul concluded that the “the entire web is spam when it comes to major appliance reviews”.</i><p>So I happen to know somebody who is taking a small section of the home appliance market and creating content around it -- reviews, news, advice, a place for other consumers to talk to each other.<p>Of course to do this you need to have income, so they are going to use some sort of ad-supported model.<p>My question is very simple: is their project a spam site or not? To some, I guess it would qualify. To others, not.<p>You see, there are two questions when it comes to search results: 1) Am I being presented results that match the query I entered? and 2) Am I being presented results that match what I want to know?<p>These are two entirely different things. A third-grader looking for information on a movie star might find a games page with all sorts of information on that star -- all sponsored by some kind of adsensey stuff. And he's very happy.  A researcher typing in the same question gets the same page? He's pissed.<p>There is no universal answer for any one question. It's all dependent on the culture, education, and intent of the user -- all of which are not easily communicated to a search engine.<p>Look -- this is a real problem. I hate it. Sucks to go to pages you don't like. All I'm saying is that it's more complicated than ""we need a new Google"" Finding what you want exactly when you want it is a difficult and non-trivial problem. We just got lucky in that Google found a simple algorithm that can be helpful in some situations. It may be that we're seeing the natural end of the usefulness of that algorithm.<p></soapbox>",1293904410

Spam/unhelpful features would be detected quickly.

2057921,comment,2057815,2057815,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think Net Neutrality is a complicated debate and this depresses me because it's obvious the pro-net neutrality side is avoiding the counter argument by assuming the other side is just stupid.<p>Just to state it outright that counter argument is:  The FCC regulates TV and Radio to keep it from ""harming"" the consumer.  The FCC would be doing the same with net neutrality.  But once you establish a precedent of ""the FCC can regulate internet providers to prevent what they perceive as harm to the consumer"" you open the floodgates.<p>We saw this just recently with Wikileaks.  The only difference was the Federal Government went after hosts because they couldn't legally demand ISP's block the traffic.  But the government clearly felt Wikileaks was harmful to the nation (many senators said that outright).<p>Once you establish the FCC as the arbiter of ""harm"" on the Internet they are free to block whatever they need to.  Wikileaks, Porn, whatever.<p>Now of course there is a valid counter argument that almost everyone on HN knows.  The above theory revolves around the free market being able to regulate itself and that's hard to do when there's very little competition.  How can the free market regulate itself with competition if the only competition is a phone monopoly and a cable monopoly?.<p>But the debate is weighing the ineffectiveness of competition vs the danger of regulation and that's not a no-brainer question.  The lack of support for net neutrality in that poll is, IMHO, a direct result of those in favor of it assuming people who don't immediately agree with them are stupid and not bothering to make the case to them.",1293903847

Preparing food yourself is the rule in my corner of the world (the Netherlands) - going out for dinner an exception. And up until a few years ago you'd be hard pressed to find a public place that actually served breakfast.<p>Of course, not every Dutchmen is a great cook (to say the least ;-) but I think you'd have a hard time to find a Dutch adult who doesn't have the means or is not able to prepare  (much) more elaborate meals than discussed in this article.
And probably this holds true for most of Europe as well. Maybe even for the rest of the world except the US?<p>Having said that though, I feel that the situation is slowly changing in recent years - primarily for the wealthier part of the population, but still. Kind of makes me sad if I see products in the supermarket which are 'ready made' and 4 times as expensive as the individual ingredients, while knowing that making the same dish from scratch would hardly take longer than preparing the 'ready made' variant and be healthier and cheaper to boot.",1293902518

Surely they aren't the only browser vendor that won't be implementing native client. Mozilla is being singled out here precisely because other major platforms are considered to be lost causes.<p>Safari and Internet Explorer are unlikely to support NaCl for obvious competitive issues. Heavily curated platforms like the iPhone prevent even third parties from supporting such a feature.<p>Once you realize that even with Mozilla support you'd still only be looking at a ~60% penetration, you're going to be working around it anyway. Once you're dictating platforms, plugins or providing a fall back implementation I'm not sure if support in one specific browser is going to make or break anything.

2057880,comment,2057631,2057804,0,0,kls,,,"Right, the sad truth is we looked at Neo4J a long time ago and we decided against it because of the licensing. Not because we are cheap, but because we knew that the licensing would keep it from being a mainstream product, and the reality is as a developer you have to invest your time where the money is, and that is always where the momentum is. Toolkits and frameworks like Struts or jQuery succeeded because of their licensing not in spite of them.<p>I like to take Ext.js as an example they where a front-runner in the JS toolkit space early on and to many looked like they had it in the bag. So much so that one day they switched their licensing to a GPL / commercial model. 
Overnight it seemed they went from the heir apparent to a footnote in the JS toolkit space.<p>Licensing has a lot to do with technical selection when it comes to application building blocks, I see Neo4J as a different but in the end similar building block and therefore the licensing is extremely important to me. I think they have a good piece of technology, that due to licensing will most likely leave it in the niche market, therefore I chose to not invest my time in it and learn one of the more liberally licensed alternatives, which since that time have gained momentum. On a purely technical level, I would have chose Neo4J so the moral of the story is that licensing plays an equal part in technical selection.<p>To be clear, I am not telling anyone how to license their hard work, just offering some insight into how some developers chose the technology to invest their time in.",1293902439

381466,comment,381254,381441,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Several, actually.  About 20% of the programmers I've worked with have been over 50, with the majority of the rest being in their 30s.  Two of the over-50s (I think one's close to 60 now) actually made it to VP of Engineering in various companies and then dropped <i>back</i> to a programmer role because that's what they wanted to do.<p>The ranks do thin out, and I think programming is largely a young-person's game.  But the people who are really passionate about it when they're 20 tend to be the ones that stick around for a lifetime.<p>And at least in Massachusetts, older programmers <i>are</i> respected.  Maybe it's different in Silicon Valley; I've heard the culture is much more youth-oriented there (one of the reasons it appeals to me, actually).  But here you're expected to pay your dues, and senior software engineers really <i>are</i> senior.",1228114584
381465,comment,381254,381254,0,0,awt,,,"Programmers have the potential to generate a lot of cash in a short period of time, whether through consulting, full-time employment, or through the development of their own software.  While you can invest your time in learning new skills, you can also invest your money in assets that are more stable than various programming skills.  You can buy property, businesses, stocks, and funds that can support you later on should you tire of learning the most marketable skills of the day.  Perhaps this is where many of the web developers will go -- somewhere else less stressful.<p>I do believe however, that attaining true expertise in one programming field is largely transferable to another field, so perhaps time spent learning programming skills holds it's value relatively well.",1228114553
381464,comment,381158,381428,0,0,patio11,,,"I got my current job by overdelivering on a project for a customer of a previous job.  When my previous contract ended, I called up the customer and asked if he knew of anybody who needed work.  He offered to hire me on the spot and immediately started contacting his customers to see who could use another body (he runs a consulting shop).  One of the customers wanted me on a permanent basis rather than as a contractor -- promises were exchanged, bows happened, and the matter was resolved.<p>Some time after that I wrote up a resume and had a job interview, but these were formalities which only existed to ratify the decision made previously.<p>That's pretty much how you get your job anywhere, right?  Be good at what you do.  Network.<p>My one Japan-specific tip: you can be successful in America without a set of business cards.  You can probably be successful in Japan without them, too, but I'd really fork over $20 for a nice set of bilingual ones.  Whenever you meet a Japanese businessman, make sure you get his and he gets yours.  This is not hard.  (I'd get REALLY good at self-introductions too.  Also not hard.)<p>Then, when that businessman hears one of his salaryman buddies complaining that the project is failing because nobody speaks English, he's going to remember the one American engineer he has ever met who speaks Japanese.  And presto, you just got a job offer.<p>Bonus points if you're one of the folks who worries incessantly about outsourcing: India graduated in excess of 200,000 engineers last year.  It also had approximately 500 people pass either level 1 or level 2 of the JLPT, which is pretty much the minimum for successfully working here in a professional capacity.  Draw a Venn diagram of those two groups -- the number in the middle is in the dozens, if that.  (If you are one of the people in the middle, please, send me an email.  I want your business card.)<p>(Actual quote from my future boss at my job ""interview"": ""I hadn't realized you'd be white.  <i>Not that there is anything wrong with that.</i>  Its just, when $ADVOCATE was describing you, he said your Japanese was great for an American and I assumed you were probably half-Japanese or something."")",1228114531

Open Source projects are mostly the fiefdoms of the founders of a project. If you get a good founder you get a good project. Good doesn't have to mean good at code, a good leader can find good coders.<p>Sometimes, though, Open Source means survival of the fittest. This project is not the easiest to use or maintain. That causes people to go elsewhere. Well the value leaves, so does people's interest. Open Source isn't a corporation, after all, no-one is paying anyone to do dumb stuff all day.",1228113599

381441,comment,381254,381371,0,0,timr,,,"That's the theory, but it's not what happens in practice.<p>In reality, how many older programmers do you know who are still coding professionally?  Of the guys I worked with just a decade ago, most have moved into management, or out of the field entirely.  If the people in my circle are representative, coding isn't a profession with any longevity.<p>Of course, it makes sense:  it's simply not realistic to expect that you can continually re-invent your professional life on an eight-year cycle.  Even if you have the tenacity and mental skill required to do it, the drive eventually goes away, because it's a futile game.  You become a modern-day Sisyphus, struggling to push your rock up a hill, only to watch a new generation of people come along and push it back down.  And given that our colleagues in other fields -- law, medicine, engineering -- grow more respected with time, it's not unreasonable to want something more.",1228112420

6427993,comment,6424132,6427754,1,0,robomartin,,,"In talking to a number of people who&#x27;ve purchased or built a range of what I would characterize as hobby machines the common thread is that they are nearly unusable or a complete pain to use for real commercial work.  Everyone I know who uses 3D printing for non-trivial business purposes either contracts out the work to 3D printing service bureaus with heavy duty commercial grade machines or they actually invest on such machines to do the printing in house.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that hobby-grade machines are useless.  The degree of interest these projects garner on sites like KS means something.  Perhaps it means that people are clamoring for significantly cheaper solutions. Or, perhaps, it means they are happy to have 3D printers that perform reasonably well with some TLC.<p>At some level I equate it to what happens with CNC machining equipment.  I&#x27;ve built and purchased many low cost home-brewed CNC machining solutions.  In retrospect they were always a pain in the ass to use in one form or another.  It was always far more time and cost effective to send parts out to have them machined by capable shops with capable industrial-grade machines.<p>I eventually purchased my own industrial-grade machines.  I had Haas VMC&#x27;s and a lathes in house.  That&#x27;s when I saw the light.  The difference between the hobby/garage machines and what the pro&#x27;s are using is massive.  It went from screwing around with the machine to make it work, maintaing tolerances, deal with software issues, repairing it, etc. to just using it and producing very high quality parts every single time.<p>CNC machining, at that point, became a source of creativity that did not detract from the design process but almost added to it.<p>This drip 3D printing gizmo is great.  Like I said, I am supporting it.  I could be lots of fun.  A professional tool it is not.  Not at this stage anyway.",1379883577

I think a good way to keep yourself from getting sucked into that trap -- of keeping up with latest Miley Cyrus scandal or whatever, is to just stay away from the crowd that spends too much time on it.

People who are aware often looks smart and more importantly make smarter decisions.<p>2.

At the same time, this is an issue when you consider using Docker as a part of your production deployment toolchain. I think both ways should be supported: incremental multi-layered images for development or exploration, and then possibility of creating a single, compact image for lower overhead in deployment. In a perfect world, it would be a switch for `docker build`, but I&#x27;m not fluent enough in Go to propose a solution on that side.<p>Some people have considered another approach: flattening an existing stack of images. Scripts for that are linked from the Docker issue on GitHub. I wasn&#x27;t able to get any of these working, and the logic behind these seemed quite convoluted.<p>Still, my script is just a proof of concept - I tried whether it is possible to take the approach I use internally for Docker build scripts, and use it to build Dockerfiles. It seems it&#x27;s possible, and it delivers good results.

Working hard or hard enough is no guarantee of success.  Most brick layers work a hundred times harder than a programmer yet don&#x27;t produce proportionally higher results.<p>Scenarios such as a single mother working 12.5 jobs to survive are often brought out to refute the sort of thing I am saying.  Nonsense.  You could tear those counter-arguments apart a million different ways.  Yes, sometimes there&#x27;s bad luck.  Any civilized society ought to have assistance for those who truly need it.  The &quot;single mother with three jobs&quot; scenario could very well be a candidate for such help.<p>You could also say that a lot of people are the result of a whole sequence of bad decisions.  If your argument, then, is that all people are equal, well, you are wrong.  At a popular vacation spot I&#x27;ve seen people jump off a bridge into the river below.  Every year a few get killed or come out of their adventure paralyzed from the neck down when they hit the rocks below.  They are morons, not victims.  Yet they want me to support them in one way or another for the rest of their lives.  People have to be responsible for their actions and the choices they make in life.  I don&#x27;t jump off that bridge because it is incredibly dangerous.  I have also taugt my kids the same.<p>I can&#x27;t answer the single mother scenario without details.  Did she get knocked-up as a teenager, not a rape but just being irresponsible?  Well, she is living with the results of having made that decision.  Her family and community failed to teach her responsible behavior.<p>Was she raped?  Did her husband of many years die?  Let&#x27;s help her.  Forever? Nope.  Get her an education so she can earn a decent wage through one job and attend to her kids properly.<p>You seem to want equal opportunity and equal outcomes for everyone in society.  That&#x27;s a nice Start Trek utopia society idea.  The truth is that there are people who will never amount to anything due to a range of factors, from lack of education to addiction or something as simple as being really good at making bad decisions (and all of the above).  As a comedian says: You can&#x27;t fix stupid.<p>Those who got caught by unfortunate events and have fallen on hard times as a result deserve and ought to receive our collective help.  The only requirement should be that they truly dedicate themselves to utilize the help to elevate their station and not burden society forever.<p>Those at the extremes (really old people with nowhere to go and other such examples) must also receive our support.  However, we ougt to do everything possible to address the genesis of these problems whenever possible.  How did they get there?  How can we prevent that going forward?<p>And then there&#x27;s the whole income inequality argument these articles want to bring about.  I am sorry, but a single mother of two kids working three jobs just to stay afloat will not become a Donald Trump if she does not make changes.  And yes, it would be horribly difficult to advance from that frame of reference.  Horribly difficult.  That still does nothing to justify the idea that everyone ought to be equal.  I&#x27;ve had the experience of being down in my luck.  Homeless. Not a dime to my name.  No job.  Lost everything in the span of about a year.  It took me over ten years to get back to the point where I was able to buy a house.  Yes, it was hard work, but it was also smart work.<p>Then there are the stories of immigrants who landed on our shores without a dime to their names and without even knowing the language.  Lots of them end up doing very well, they raise wonderful families, send all their kids to college and end-up living far better than a lot of people born in the US.<p>The difference between success, failure or mediocrity is often measured in grit, determination, focus, a bit of luck and having the presence of mind to make use of it.  My critique in the previous comment was primarily aimed at young people who waste their youth away with bullshit and are then convinced that the 1% or the 10% are there to oppress and keep them down.<p>We live in a fairly nice part of Los Angeles and I see these choices being made by some of my kid&#x27;s friends and their families.  We push our kids to pursue activities that will enrich their lives and provide them with intellectual advantages.  My weekends are nearly 100% dedicated to this.  I see other parents who spend nearly no time with their kids.  Instead they plug the kids into their TV&#x27;s, the Internet, playstations or xbox&#x27;s and watch days, weeks and years go by.  So, while my kids are doing two to three hours of homework every day to get ready to make something of themselves later in life other kids are becoming Call of Duty experts or other such bullshit.  Now, if one of those girls ends-up knocked-up in high school and a single mother having to hold down three menial jobs to make ends meet, who&#x27;s fault was it and why am I responsible for her?  What right does she have to speak ill of those who, through having made sacrifices, achieved success in life?",1379882218

A given marker is unlikely to be present in <i>exactly</i> 50% of the population, and to the extent that it isn&#x27;t it can reduce the probability by that amount that a test match is a true match. Meanwhile the suspect pool for a given crime is likely to encompass several (perhaps many) members of the same extended family, who for the obvious reason are significantly more likely than random members of the world population to have the tested markers match one another. Even within a city you will generally see concentrations of specific ethnicities who may have a higher statistical incidence of specific genetic markers than other populations, which can screw up the numbers by an amount that historically hasn&#x27;t even knowable because we don&#x27;t have good numbers on the statistical incidence of specific markers within geographical populations.<p>The place where this is most pernicious is when they get a sample from a crime scene and run it against some &quot;DNA database&quot; to find a hit. Then everybody is talking about the probability that X suspect would match the DNA at the crime scene rather than the probability that <i>someone</i> in the database would match even if the actual perpetrator wasn&#x27;t in the database.",1379881990

For example, if you&#x27;ve always identified as a shy, introverted kid, the best thing you can do is to talk to strangers, make some friends, organize some events, and generally become the life of the party.  If you&#x27;ve always identified as a learner and not a doer, the best thing you can do is take on a task that seems both pointless and challenging, do it to the best of your ability, and see what you learn from it.  The way you phrase your question makes me think that you identify success with <i>knowing</i> things, rather than <i>experiencing</i> things or <i>doing</i> things.  So if you want to grow as a person, the most productive things you could be doing are to get way out of that comfort zone and see what happens if, say, you traveled to another country where you don&#x27;t know anyone, or if you took on a highly-visible project where you might fail.<p>If you want to seem smart at cocktail parties, the best way to do that is to know just slightly more than your friends at all the things they care about.  Some resources for that: Wikipedia, pop science magazines like Discover or Popular Science, Mythbusters, Science Reddit, and all the stuff linked from there.  Also stay up to date on your celebrity gossip, pop culture, and sports scores.<p>If you want to make money, the way to do that is to pick an area that is currently in demand in the economy, specialize in that, and go deep, enough that you have more knowledge than anyone else.  Computers are hot right now, as is SEO and online marketing.  Biotech may be hot in the near future, as is clean tech.  You basically want to deepen your knowledge as opposed to broadening it.  Whenever there&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t understand - and I mean don&#x27;t fully understand, it&#x27;s easy to have a superficial understanding of things - go seek it out and learn as much as possible about it.<p>Learning about something for achieving an objective is similar, but the objective is chosen by you instead of by the economy.",1379880902

All you need to do is to get reasonably competent in one or two mainstream programming languages (I emphasize reasonably, you definitely don&#x27;t need expert knowledge), say Java or C++. This shouldn&#x27;t take more than a couple of weeks of focused effort if you already have some degree in CS and know programming. At the same time you have to refresh your memory about data structures and algorithms. Dust off your favorite algorithm book, and go through sorting, searching, binary trees, hashing, elementary graph algorithms and dynamic programming. If you have taken a relevant course before and paid attention to it (you were told this was going to be your most important CS course ever, no?), it shouldn&#x27;t take more than a day or two to remember this stuff (again assuming that your undergrad CS degree was not a waste of time). Then you need to solve a few exercises to practice, mostly to become confident in yourself. Topcoder, dozens of online sample questions would do. You won&#x27;t need full coverage of every possibility, but to assure yourself that your brain still ticks and backed by your knowledge you can approach the problem presented to you at the interview. In total you need a week and a half or two weeks to get to top shape to pass interview at the likes of facebook, google, amazon et al.",1379880667

Plenty inherit the family business and/or money and wield local power.<p>In formulating my reply, I think I came around to the other point of view.  Bad things can happen, but inherited money is probably a minor enabler in this, and just the opposite can happen as well (inherited money can do much good).",1229515195

Java is still philosophically crippled by James Gosling's original intent that its users would be people for whom C++ was too difficult. Now they are struggling to retrofit features in. In C# Anders Hejlsberg created a language that he could use himself, that's the big difference.<p>(Yes I know about Clojure but it's not Sun Clojure is it?)",1229514983

400801,comment,399365,400598,0,0,sokoloff,,,"Perhaps it would be helpful to propose some alternative situation-specific metric of fair to help me understand what you're not understanding about what I'm saying. To you, how would you define ""fair"" so as to create a stable system in a way that's fundamentally different from ""in keeping with free market economics""?<p>In a free market of lenders and borrowers, ""fair"" is whatever each party agrees to enter into acting in their own best interest. If the lender thinks the terms are ""unfair"" to them, they don't lend. If the borrower thinks the terms are ""unfair"" to them, they do not borrow. Therefore, if a lender lends to a borrower, both parties have agreed that the deal is ""fair"".<p>If a borrower finds that no one will lend to them on terms the borrower likes and then freely decides to loosen their standards and borrow anyway, I don't see any unfairness at work, rather that the borrower has updated their own concept of what a ""fair deal"" is, in order to borrow the money they want.",1229514711

1) These 27 actions should only be used by an administrator.
2) All users must register with a valid looking email and choose a username.<p>Every one of those would still take one line, wouldn't it be simpler to just code the damn thing yourself???",1229514212

And yet the primary business model  of successful software is (or was) charging people for the copying of those bits (allowing, rightly so, the creators of those bits to get paid for the content creation).<p>I am not saying its wrong, not at all, it just feels like a kind of arbitrage, and can't last. Well I guess that's one business reason why software is increasingly moving online.<p>I guess the same is true of any content creator.

400792,comment,399863,400156,0,0,miked,,,"The usefulness of measuring depends on how actionable the measurements are. I think this is one of the big reasons that the startup culture in Europe has never really developed. In most European countries (and US government agencies) it's almost impossible to fire someone after a short probationary period. This distorts labor markets so badly that even left-leaning labor economists (e.g., Brad DeLong) have sharply criticized European labor laws.<p>This brings up an interesting sorting issue. If it's easy for people to be terminated and/or quit (because they know that there are other jobs, available in part because other employees have been fired or quit), there should, over time, be an improvement in the matching between employees and jobs. This should lead to higher productivity as well, not to mention greater job satisfaction.",1229514033

I don't care if you view adverts and decide not to click on them.<p>I do care if you aren't even prepared to entertain the notion that at some point you might find an advert intriguing enough to click on it.<p>How is the relevancy/usefulness of adverts going to increase if you're not prepared to listen?<p>It's fine to be hostile to websites that use horrible techniques - flash, popups, etc etc many of the news sites seem to do it now - ""Here's an advert while the article 'loads'""... But I think the non-jerk thing to do is to give websites at least a <i>chance</i>. <i>IF</i> they abuse your trust, and advertise intrusively in your face, it's probably best to just not go to that website any more.<p>By installing a blanket earplug mentality, you're refusing to trust any website to treat you properly. Which IMHO is pretty antisocial.<p>>> ""What advertiser would want to waste ads on people who are obviously hostile?""<p>Do people using adblock never buy anything? Do they never find information useful or interesting? Are they really immune to all forms of useful communication? Never read a product review and then decided to purchase? I'm skeptical.<p></rant>",1229513650

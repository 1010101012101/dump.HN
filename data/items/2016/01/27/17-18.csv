If you had access to a compromised Juniper router it would be straight forward to add a rule to mirror packets which were headed to the NTP pool addresses.<p>Oddly after being an unwitting participant in one of the NTP amplification attacks I set up my own stratum 0 NTP server based on the beaglebone black, the adafruit GPS module, and the PPS time keeper code. So all of my machines only talk internally for time, although initial installs still use what ever the distro packed into them. I brought up Debian on a Dragonboard 410c and it sets the time via an NTP call during the initial startup process.

We gave a functional (2) and an iterative (9) formulation of such a decision theoretic agent, which is general enough to cover all AI problem classes, as has been demonstrated by several examples. The main remaining problem is the unknown prior probability distribution AI\nof the environment(s).<p><...> the universal semimeasure, based on ideas from algorithmic information theory, solves the problem of the unknown prior distribution for induction problems.  No explicit learning procedure is necessary ... . We unified the theory of universal sequence prediction with the decision theoretic agent by replacing the\nunknown true prior AI by an appropriately generalized universal semimeasure ξAI. We\ngave strong arguments that the resulting AIξ model is the most intelligent, parameterless\nand environmental/application independent model possible.<p>The major drawback of the AIξ model is that it is\nuncomputable, or more precisely, only asymptotically computable, which makes an implementation impossible. To overcome this problem, we cons tructed a modified model AI, which is still effectively more intelligent than any other time and space bounded algorithm.&quot;<p>The copy/paste lost some information, especially symbols, so take a look at the paper for a better read.",1453917415

In the former case, we&#x27;re talking about debts established in the course of various financial transactions between private parties. In the latter case, we&#x27;re talking about fees (or more specifically in this case, what would colloquially be known as fines) that are imposed by the state for punitive and administrative reasons. Skipping out on the former will (generally) result in ruined credit scores and civil suits; skipping out on the latter is an civil or criminal offense against the state.<p>>even if you grant there is a difference between the debt types, how can he be wrong about it being de facto &quot;debtors prison&quot;? Who cares what the debt type is, it would still be a debtors prison, and there are a myriad of very good reasons we got rid of such things!<p>The term &#x27;debtor&#x27;s prison&#x27; is a loaded term, perjoratively describing historical cases of imprisonment of persons for failing to pay private debts. Barring edge cases (i.e., fraud), this has largely been eliminated in the USA. Imprisonment for failing to pay fines imposed for offenses against the law, on the other hand, is not a practice that has ever been (nor is likely to be) eliminated. And I don&#x27;t buy that there are &#x27;good reasons to get rid of such things&#x27;, but that&#x27;s a different discussion than the one at hand.<p>>Another thing to remember is that fees have become revenue generators, and to look at them as punitive damages to be payed to the public for offenses is a naive take on the ways fees have developed in the legal and justice systems.<p>Be that as it may, it&#x27;s not germane to whether or not it&#x27;s okay for the state to use creative ways to collect on previous assessed fines.<p>>I (in Texas btw) who almost never gets tickets, got one last year. Normally I have a paralegal friend do the deferred adjudication, I take a class, and move on. Well this last ticket they missed the deadline, I forgot about it, and the original $160 fee ballooned eventually to $700! Not only that, but technically, until I payed it, there was a warrant out for my arrest!\nDo you think that kind of percentage increase is warranted or the warrant for arrest for not paying a fee is justified, because I certainly don&#x27;t.<p>Actually, I do think it&#x27;s justified. Dealing with low level tickets is hardly difficult or burdensome, and the state has excellent reasons to create strong disincentives for dodging punishment. Further, paying a steep premium for irresponsible handling of your incident seems far preferable to serving actual jail time, or facing some other less dignified form of corporal punishment (as you might receive in a less westernized nations).<p>> they are extorting people because they are behind on payments<p>There&#x27;s no extortion going on. It&#x27;s implicit that the state&#x27;s agents possess the means to impose compliance with the law; in cases where the law dictates that individuals pay a fine, it&#x27;s reasonable for the state&#x27;s agents to collect that fine or initiate further punishment for noncompliance with the law. Given the choice between jail + the courts and paying a high fee (some of which is to cover the costs associated with payment collection), a 25% premium hardly seems unreasonable.",1453916266

However individuals committed to reducing weight can put in some time to increasing calories out (often by cardio activities such as jogging/running/cycling/swimming).<p>It just doesnt follow to say &quot;you cannot outrun a bad diet&quot; followed by &quot;the base metabolic rate is the primary means of weight loss&quot;. There is tons of evidence that exercise is exactly what increases your base metabolic rate! Here is just one study:<p>&quot;Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of the daily energy budget in most human societies and, therefore, any increases in RMR in response to exercise interventions are potentially of great importance&quot; [0]<p>If RMR is the most important thing to reducing weight, exercise is the most straightforward way to improve RMR and reducing weight. But I wont make this reductionist claim; clearly diet is also important.<p>Exercise can be very helpful in reducing weight; it&#x27;s simple physics of increasing calories out. My most successful friend losing weight changed both his diet and increased exercising to about an hour a day. He not only shredded 30-40 pounds, but gained from the additional benefits of higher resting metabolic rate, increased cardio health benefits, reduced stress, and felt like he had more energy with fewer coffees. The quick weight loss he felt meant he didn&#x27;t have to have a yearlong slog waiting to see results, making the process all the more rewarding which significantly helps for some people&#x27;s psychology. Sure it sucked in the beginning, but his life was unbalanced and he committed to making big changes.<p>It&#x27;s almost cheating to exercise with improved diets; imagine if you were keto eating salads and still able to remove &quot;chocolate bar debt&quot; from the past by 30 minutes to an hour of activity a day followed by increased RMR for the next 24 hours.<p>Bad diets are bad. Complemented with exercise you can improve your metabolic rate which will give you long term weight loss and health benefits.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14692598"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14692598</a>",1453916118

It&#x27;s the <i>rule.</i><p>Whether from pressures from within or without, states inevitably degrade or even collapse. One of the typical patterns of collapse for a democracy is regression to dictatorship. It&#x27;s not implausible.<p>Now, when looking at the nation as it is, rather than as it could be, I&#x27;m rather comforted. By all appearances the government continues to provide basic services, the military has unwavering loyalty to the civilian government, and the government is run by politicians chosen by popular election.<p>But government deficits are exploding, the sovereignties of the world are gobbling up private debt to prop up large financial firms, and the financial sector is so disconnected from the real economy that it has become one giant martingale that is due for a 25% downward correction.<p>What worries me most is that previously, there could be no permanent dictatorship. The United States has both the power and the infrastructure to become one. A few legal judgements here, a few electoral tweaks there, and our democracy becomes mere government theater, advertising that distracts us from the actual sovereigns and their interests.<p>I believe the current pattern of creeping statism from the left and steady erosion of Constitutional protections from the right are a lethal combination for a democracy.<p>There&#x27;s some paranoia here, sure.

There are lots of problems with JavaScript as it stands.<p>I don&#x27;t think the differences between the CLR and JS are &quot;substantive&quot; in that they make it impossible to build working, performant apps. So far the main things you have cited are (a) the lack of WeakRef and (b) a bad standard library. I truly don&#x27;t mean any &quot;insult&quot; here, but weak references do not strike me as something that makes the difference between an app working (and working fast) versus being incredibly slow. WeakMap covers lots of the use cases for WeakRef already. On the native side, Objective-C didn&#x27;t even have weak references until iOS 5. As for the standard library, developers just add lodash or whatever they need; it&#x27;s not ideal, sure, but it&#x27;s just a question of whether the functionality comes bundled or whether developers add it themselves.<p>If you add all the things you want to JS in order to get it up to parity with .NET by your definition, but do nothing to the DOM and rendering stack, you&#x27;ll still have the performance problems people cite with mobile Web apps. On the other hand, if you do nothing to JS and fix the DOM and rendering stack, then I believe the Web <i>will</i> be able to compete with native. This is not to say we shouldn&#x27;t improve JS, but it&#x27;s not on the top list of things holding the Web back.",1453915205

I&#x27;m still early in coding, so I&#x27;ll start this month with a summary of the state of the AI field.<p>Artificial intelligence may seem like something out of science fiction, but most of us already use tools and services every day that rely on AI. When you do a voice search on your phone, put a check into an ATM, or use a fitness tracker to count your steps, you&#x27;re using basic forms of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. More sophisticated AI systems can already diagnose diseases, drive cars and search the skies for planets better than people. This is why AI is such an exciting field -- it opens up so many new possibilities for enhancing humanity&#x27;s capabilities.<p>So what can AI do and what are its limits? What things is AI good at and what is AI bad at?\nSimply put, today&#x27;s AI is good at recognizing patterns and bad at what we would call &quot;common sense&quot;.<p>The primary method used to train AI systems is called supervised learning. This is like when you show a picture book to a child and tell them the names of everything they see. If you show an AI thousands of pictures of dogs, you can train it to start recognizing dogs.<p>You can teach AIs to do a lot of things this way. For example, we can teach an AI to recognize all of your friends&#x27; faces by showing it thousands of photos, and then it can suggest tags for the photos you upload on Facebook. You can teach an AI to recognize speech by having it listen to thousands of hours of speeches throughout history while also showing it transcriptions of what was said. You can teach an AI to diagnose melanoma by showing it thousands of photos of tumors. You can even teach an AI how to drive a car and automatically brake by showing it thousands of examples of people and obstacles it might encounter on the road.<p>Diagnosing cancer, driving cars, transcribing speech, playing games and tagging photos may sound like very different tasks, but they&#x27;re all examples of teaching an AI to recognize patterns by showing them many examples.<p>Many different problems can be reduced to pattern recognition tasks that sophisticated AIs can then solve. This year, I&#x27;ll teach my simple AI to recognize patterns. I&#x27;ll train it to recognize my voice so I can control my home through speaking. I&#x27;ll train it to recognize my face so it can open the door when I&#x27;m approaching, and so on.<p>But there are lots of limitations of this approach. For one, to teach a person something new, you typically don&#x27;t need to tell them about it thousands of times. So the state of the art in AI is still much slower than how we learn.<p>But more importantly, pattern recognition is very different from common sense -- and nobody knows how to teach an AI that yet.<p>Without common sense, AI systems can&#x27;t use knowledge they&#x27;ve learned in one area and easily apply it to another situation. This means they can&#x27;t effectively react to new problems or situations they haven&#x27;t seen before, which is so much of we all do everyday and what we call intelligence.<p>Our best guess at how to teach an AI common sense is through a method called unsupervised learning. My example of supervised learning above was showing a picture book to a child and telling them the names of everything they see. Unsupervised learning would be giving them a book and letting them figure out what to do with it. They could pick it up and by touching it learn to turn the pages. Or they could let go of it and realize it falls to the ground.<p>Unsupervised learning is learning how the world works by observing and trying things out rather than being told what to do. This is how most animals learn. It&#x27;s key to building systems with human-like common sense because it doesn&#x27;t require a person to teach it everything they know. It gives the machine the ability to anticipate what may happen in the future and predict the effect of an action. It could help us build machines that can hold conversations or plan complex sequences of actions -- necessary components for any authentic Jarvis.<p>Unsupervised learning is a long term focus of our AI research team at Facebook, and it remains an important challenge for the whole AI research community.<p>Since no one understands how general unsupervised learning actually works, we&#x27;re quite a ways off from building the general AIs you see in movies. Some people claim this is just a matter of getting more computing power -- and that as Moore&#x27;s law continues and computing becomes cheaper we&#x27;ll naturally have AIs that surpass human intelligence. This is incorrect. We fundamentally do not understand how general learning works. This is an unsolved problem -- maybe the most important problem of this century or even millennium. Until we solve this problem, throwing all the machine power in the world at it cannot create an AI that can do everything a person can.<p>We should not be afraid of AI. Instead, we should hope for the amazing amount of good it will do in the world. It will saves lives by diagnosing diseases and driving us around more safely. It will enable breakthroughs by helping us find new planets and understand Earth&#x27;s climate. It will help in areas we haven&#x27;t even thought of today.<p>Jarvis is still a long way off, and we’re not going to solve most of these engineering challenges in the next year. But I&#x27;m glad to be joining the effort and doing what I can to push the field of AI forward.&quot;",1453914964

This would be why the treatment is toxic and suppressive of proliferation.<p>At this point, I still think the presence of indels at the site (ie the proposed NHEJ mechanism) is just as easily explained by selection for pre-existing mutants. The experiments involving insertion of DNA (ie the proposed HDR mechanism) are better, but lack controls for &quot;off-target&quot; PCR amplification when showing the gels. IE we need to know how often the template itself will be amplified under their primers/conditions, both free and if it gets incorporated in some random location.<p>When segments across the insertion junction are amplified, sequenced, and reported, I find this convincing as it is a precise prediction that matches the data and I can think of no other explanation. The other experiments are pretty much redundant and add nothing. However, the reports I have seen contain little methodological or quantitative information regarding these sequences which does make me remain skeptical, especially about claims of efficiency. Those claims seem to always be determined using the former experiments that can be explained in other ways.",1453914756

How are you getting any nutrition in, since fruit and vegetables are almost all carbs?<p>Vegetables are often relatively high in carbs but low in total calories, and so the contribution of their carbs to your total calories can be low even if you have a lot of vegetables in your diet.<p>For instance, I recently had a steak and corn for dinner. The corn was 80 calories per serving, 15 g of carb, so 75% of calories from carbs. The steak was 600 calories, 3 g of carb (from the steak sauce I used, not the steak itself), with is 2% calories from carbs. I had two servings of corn with my steak, so the total meal was 760 calories, 33 g carbs, which is 17% calories from carbs.<p>If I had not chosen corn I probably would have chosen a can of green beans (70 calories, 7 g of carbs, which is 40% calories from carbs) which would have made the total meal 6% calories from carbs. Heck, double the green beans...two full 14.5 oz cans (almost a kilogram of green beans!), and the total for the meal would only rise to 9% calories from carbs.<p>Or consider salads. I use a pre-made salad mix [1] (I&#x27;m lazy). One bowl of this is 20 calories, 3 g carbs. That&#x27;s 60% of calories from carbs. I use a dressing on this that is 240 calories, 4 g of carbs, so 7% calories from carbs. The salad mix combined with the dressing gives me 26 calories, 7 g carbs, so 11% calories from carbs. Recently I add some chopped up ham to this that added 200 calories, 0 g carbs, making the total salad 6% calories from carbs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.freshexpress.com/product/refreshing-mixes/iceberg-garden.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freshexpress.com/product/refreshing-mixes/iceberg...</a>  and yes, the nutrition values I gave above do not match what they give on the site.

I believe there is some paradigm where happy can be achieved if the work/happy ratio is subsidized through social programs lowering the happy curve (or at least tolerance) because of the work requirements to achieve the financial base to maintain that curve. It&#x27;s an interesting problem, but overwhelming it causes desperation and by a minor extension drug / alcohol abuse / crime syndication, and violence (domestic abuse and gun deaths in particular). The upward mobility is one thing, but an opposite paradigm is also a very interesting dynamic with respect to if money can or cannot by happiness.

(The eggs were used to make tempera paint before the advent of oil.) Gradually, Verrocchio gave his charge greater responsibility, even permitting him to paint portions of his own artwork. Why did Leonardo stay an apprentice for so long? He could easily have found work elsewhere, but he clearly valued the experience he acquired in the dusty, chaotic workshop.

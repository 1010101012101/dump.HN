You enter all your information on their web site (address, phone #, etc.) and then during the chat, they make you confirm all the information you just put in.  Why the hell did I waste 10 minutes filling out the site just to have to retype it in during the chat?<p>And their shopping cart is all f'ed up.  They let you put conflicting deals into your cart (i.e. she chose a deal on internet that was only for current customers and a deal on cable that is only for new customers).  And the cart happily allowed it. Around the 10 minute mark of the chat, the rep says ""Oh.  I just noticed that those deals aren't compatible.  You'll need to do X instead"" where X was about $20 a month more.  I canceled the order, called them, and asked how was a person supposed to know which deals are conflicting and which ones aren't if their own website doesn't stop them from being put in the cart?  Finally I got the rep on the phone to give me both deals.  Took about an hour of reasoning with them, making them walk through the website with me (which I'm sure they didn't), and finally just threatening to hang up and go with Qwest and DirecTV.  I think it was the latter that finally tipped the scale.  Of course, she can't get Qwest or DirecTV at her apartment :)",1295514958

Any NP problem can be many-one reduced to SAT, which means that there's a function that transforms an instance of the NP problem to an instance of SAT, and the answer to whether that formula is satisfiable is the same as whether that instance is a member of the NP problem (in its decision version).<p><i>So who is still standing as a contender for the hardest problem in NP?</i><p>If P = NP, then all problems in NP are as easy as each other, so this question is meaningless.",1295514094

I'm averaging one code review a day (about 200+ lines of code) lately and it would take me several times longer if I had to do it in person or even without a good code review tool.<p>That being said, being on the same page as the rest of your coworkers for what constitutes correctly-styled code is invaluable.",1295514029

Just decrease the probability of life or intelligent life. After all, it took 3 bn. years before the first multicellular life developed on Earth and 1bn. years for intelligence to develop afterwards.",1295514013

He would even contradict himself from one piece to the next.  You just chew on the points and smirk to yourself when you see the flaws.  No, Mencken definitely didn't write like he was trying to be your likable friend.<p>Graham writes like he's building a legal case or trying to get published in a scientific journal, even though the pieces are really casual observational op-eds.  The style invites you to poke holes and take each point too literally.<p>People are used to writing styles adapted to the format for good reason.  The reactions like this to Graham's pieces make a good case for learning and using rhetoric.",1206230365

I might not want whole pages autowikied, but it could be cool to have sections of articles or something. Offering a simple and easy to use webservice can drive adoption of your service in ways that you could never even begin to imagine.<p>I would also try to find some high profile bloggers in your target audience (in your case politics maybe), and write personal emails to them about how the service could be good for their readers and ask if any would be interested in trying it out, or if there were any features they would really need before the service would be useful for them (such as which wiki links were click through, showing what their readers don't know enough about or are most interested in)<p>anyways just some thoughts off the top of my head.",1206230146

143647,comment,143148,143606,0,0,mightybyte,,,"I had the same thought when I read gruseom's post.  His zooming in on your writing style is right on the money.  (By the way, I could have begun that last sentence with ""I think"", but I thought better of it.)  This is one thing I struggle with myself.  I find that I tend to want to write things that cannot be disputed, but to do so I usually have to include all the phatic cruft that you take out.  I'll have to work on that.<p>On another note, I also get the impression that you write to a certain type of person.  Possibly a type that is similar to you.  People like Jeff who take issue with your essays are simply not the target audience (whatever that means).  As someone who is currently caged in a 9-5 job with a big company, I have to say that your essay resonated deeply with me...and I loved it.  I appreciate the way your essays frequently force me to take a good hard look at what I'm doing, where I want to go, and what I need to do to get there.",1206229744

Pretty much every other factual claim of the article is nonsense.  His explanation of fractional reserve banking is upside-down.  He pulled the conjecture ""if the interest rate is 4%, then 4% of all credit will default"" from the deepest recesses of his rectum.  The assumption that the economy will revert to the state it was in just before the end of Bretton Woods reads more like the lazy premise of a short story than an economic theory.",1206228904

The way metaphors work is that they're accurate in some respects and not in others.<p>The advantage of metaphors is that they help explain things by isomorphism.  The disadvantage is that people often take them too literally.  Or pretend to if they want to attack the writer.<p>Strange as it sounds, I expected to be criticized for telling readers what they wanted to hear, not for insulting them.  If you actually read the essay, the thesis is that the famous founders who are made to seem like such gods in the press are actually not that different from ordinary programmers-- that the difference, as it says in the last paragraph, is ""due mostly to environment.""  In other words the exact opposite of the summary Atwood quotes: ""Oh... you haven't founded a company? You suck.""<p>How can so many people read an essay saying X and come away believing it said not-X?  I think what happened in this case  was that a lot of people who were already feeling self-conscious about working for big companies read the first section as some kind of criticism of them, and then either read that into the rest of the essay or (this is the Internet) didn't read any more before writing blog posts about it.",1206227999

I've gone from massive companies down to a organization of 1.  I'm not as stable, I'm more stressed, my income is lumpy.  But I have ideas.  Buckets and buckets of ideas.  I have so many I have to write them down in a book to stop them from clouding my mind.  And I have learnt - so much.  Not so much about programming - I already knew plenty on that subject.  No, I have learnt about the 'way the world really works'.  I have learnt how to solve people's needs, how to sell things, how to handle people who don't agree with you.  I have learnt how to dig deep and find the courage to keep plugging away, just so I can keep that dark corporate cubicle and mindless 'team building' exercises at bay.",1206226961

Please do email me.<p>Deep Learning done right applied to unstructured data is a great part of either an ensemble of methods or great for working with hard to engineer features.<p>I think as for normal machine learning where you are typically doing feature engineering, you need to understand what&#x27;s going on to make recommendations for actionable insights. Everything has its place.<p>I&#x27;d like to echo Andrew Ng here, the hype in deep learning is overblown. While there are great results, it&#x27;s not magic.<p>Neural networks still need feature scaling, among other things to work well. Much of the hype comes from the giant marketing machine that are the PR firms for the research labs who need new data scientists.<p>While great work is being done in these labs, much of it isn&#x27;t going to be applicable in the day to day work of a data scientist just trying to do some some basic A/B testing.

This is the code we, as security testers, were never allowed to see, even after owning up the machines hosting it. These firms are not kidding around about this stuff. It is a huge smoking gun to have uploaded any of it to some off-brand foreign svn host.<p>These are firms where you can be fired for plugging a thumb drive into your computer, or for using the company network to access Dropbox. I have worked for more than one financial firm that spent literally millions of dollars merely on the problem of detecting their network users trying to reach Google Mail.<p>I also dispute the idea that because developers commonly use ssh, gzip, and svn, that it is common practice to (1) gzip a tarball of source code, (2) encrypt that source code, (3) commit that compressed encrypted blob to svn, (4) remove all traces of the encryption key from their work computer. That&#x27;s something happens zero times on normal dev machines.<p>The conviction was overturned because the technical details of exactly what Aleynikov took from GS didn&#x27;t fit the ambitious charge the DOJ filed against him. But the appeal doesn&#x27;t refute the finding of facts from the original trial, which include:<p><i>There was more than sufficient evidence presented at trial, however, for a rational juror to conclude that Aleynikov intended to steal Goldman Sachs&#x27; proprietary source code. First, it was undisputed at trial that Aleynikov actually did take proprietary source code from Goldman Sachs. As Aleynikov concedes in his motion papers, the code he took from Goldman Sachs included a “purposefully designed” portion of the Goldman Sachs “proprietary, custom-built trading system.” Indeed, the evidence showed that Aleynikov took a significant percentage of the proprietary source code for that system. While Aleynikov attempted to show that there was open source code embedded within the proprietary code and to identify the files in which that might be true, his expert witness was only able to identify one file among those taken by Aleynikov that both bore a Goldman Sachs copyright banner and appeared to contain open source code.</i><p>I&#x27;m just fine with Aleynikov&#x27;s conviction being overturned. Again, the charges against him seemed ambitious.<p>But this is a forum full of software developers. Rayiner is a lawyer and a compiler developer. It&#x27;s somewhat insulting to everyone&#x27;s intelligence to pretend that people here are unfamiliar with ssh and svn. We understand how software development works.

I also don&#x27;t keep any fun reading or &quot;research&quot; tabs open. While working in about 1 hour sprints, I will have very few tabs open if I am even running a browser. If I visited a page briefly while reading hacker news during morning coffee, I can kill that tab and find the web page later using browser history or from memory during lunch break, etc.<p>If I need to do a Google or Bing web search, starting a browser or opening a new tab is no hassle, and a minute later the tab is gone.<p>Anyway it was interesting to read that people keep a browser running for days or longer with many tabs open. I am not being judgemental, and I hope that I don&#x27;t sound so, I just have different working preferences.",1423894723

This opens up the ability to write native parsers in other languages, say vimscript. By keeping it super simple there -are- no corner-cases.<p>There are many benefits to this (like the formatters etc that others have alluded to) from things like IDE integration (imagine lifetime elision visualisation, invalid move notifications, etc) static analysis tools and more. None of these tools then need to be written in Rust. It also means it&#x27;s easier to implement support in pre-existing multi-language tools.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate the necessity of a simple parseable grammar. Besides, people have endured much worse slights in syntax (see here Erlang).",1423893815

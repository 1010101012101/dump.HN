Mocking and/or ridiculing someone because of this doesn&#x27;t accomplish anything.<p>The article&#x27;s title was clear enough to get the point across to anyone with even the tiniest amount of brainpower, so whether or not a word is &quot;obviously&quot; missing to you or the original commenter is irrelevant. These kinds of comments subtract from the intelligent discourse that happens here and brings it one step closer to reddit. Let&#x27;s not do that. Let&#x27;s try and have even the tiniest amount of tolerance for people that don&#x27;t natively speak the language instead of making fun of them, ok?",1388937324

Like the microsite for pagd, <a href=\"http://pythonhosted.org/pagd/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pythonhosted.org/pagd/</a>, claims - everything is configurable or customizable or entirely replaceable. It is easy to hack the code once the basic principles of pluggdapps is understood, which is not difficult.",1388936796
7016075,comment,7013716,7013716,1,0,tokenadult,,,"One of the most common kinds of comments here on Hacker News about issues like this is a comment that ASSUMES that if government leaders are under pervasive surveillance they are all afraid of blackmail. But I don&#x27;t believe that, because some government leaders and some political candidates are essentially shameless. Even after they are caught (by old-fashioned journalism, or by a jilted lover or some unrelated criminal investigation) doing something unsavory, they are still willing to run for office, and SOME ARE REELECTED. United States Senator David Vitter was reelected in 2010 even after a scandal involving behavior that I would consider shameful,[1] and the antics of former DC mayor Marion Barry[2] are probably still notorious enough that they don&#x27;t need further discussion here. In short, I call baloney on the idea that NSA can keep politicians on its leash simply by knowing their secrets. Some politicians have PUBLIC lives full of dirt, and still get elected and influence policy anyway.<p>The other reason I don&#x27;t believe this HN hivemind theory of politics is that I by no means assume that everyone in politics lacks personal integrity. Some politicians, I am quite sure, could have all their secrets revealed only to have voters think &quot;Why is that person such a straight-arrow? Why not have some fun once in a while?&quot; The simple fact is that there is value system diversity in the United States electorate, and there is personal conduct probity variance among United States politicians, and there isn&#x27;t any universal way to unduly influence politicians merely through even the most diligent efforts to discover personal secrets. If politicians think that NSA is going too far (as evidently several politicians from more than one party do think), then they will receive plenty of support from the general public to rein in the surveillance. (Obligatory disclaimer: Yes, I am a lawyer, who as a judicial clerk for my state&#x27;s Supreme Court used to review case files on attorney misconduct, and, yes, some of my law school classmates are elected officials, including one member of Congress. I am absolutely certain that there are enough politicians ready to mobilize to roll back NSA surveillance programs if they really think the programs are excessive in their scope.)<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scandal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scanda...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry#1990_arrest_.26_drug_conviction\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry#1990_arrest_.26_d...</a>",1388936681

It requires the client to have knowledge of the semantics of a link relation, in the same way the client must have knowledge of how to process &quot;application/hal+json&quot; when the content-type header contains that identifier.  Out of band is when there is no information in the message that identifies the semantics that are being used.",1388936489

There is no reason for him to believe it, he doesn&#x27;t work on atmosphere or oceanic science there, and he gets his information from the same ridiculous blog posts and youtube videos as the other tin foil hats.<p>Just wanted to point out that there is something very weird going on here socially and psychologically.  I actually blame the completely non-existent trust for authority that we have in this country (US).  When you feel you cannot trust any government authority due to decades of scandals and clandestine activities (even things like subverting the encryption schemes that researchers have developed) then you become unmoored in reality.",1388935266

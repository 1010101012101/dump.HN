957137,comment,956547,956547,0,0,derefr,,,"There are two kinds of anime, and they're very similar to the two kinds of personal computers we have today. Studio Ghibli produces the kind of anime that's identifiable to Apple products—it's high-quality, expensive, has its own style, and is aimed at a very wide audience, sometimes ending up in American theaters. Additionally, the content (software) produced to go along with the format (hardware) is developed in-house.<p>Meanwhile, most other anime producers are like PC manufacturers—they compete to produce a commodity as cheaply as possible. First, they're adapting manga that has already been written, illustrated, published, marketed, and merchandised, so the customer development half of their business doesn't need doing. They simply churn out adaptations of the books they receive, and people tune in; it's a pre-made market.<p>Second, people don't <i>care</i> about the visual quality of anime. It's great when it's exceptional (I can only think of Ghibli work and FLCL at the moment), but no one expects it to be. Mostly, anime-watchers tune in to experience a visual dramatization of a story that couldn't be executed in live-action without a ridiculous budget. Things in space, giant robots, fantasy creatures that aren't just actors with bumpy foreheads, etc. They don't expect great visuals, just the bare minimum needed to understand what's going on, so they can enjoy the story without having to imagine the narrative themselves (and though they do still end up having to read the dialogue, this doesn't require any form of visual imagination.)<p>Given these two factors—that the studio's only job is to adapt a manga to the screen, and that they may do this as badly as possible and still not lose any of their following—it's no surprise that it's a process that has been outsourced and reduced to manufacturing ""more work with longer hours = better"" conditions.",1258969496

957126,comment,956700,956781,0,0,greyman,,,"[This means publishers appear to be using some leverage with search engines, forcing them into the position of possibly having to purchase the right to index their content.]<p>Yes, that's correct, I think. They (or at least Murdoch) wants to do that. Most of the folks here seems to defend Google, and some of their points are valid, but let's try to look at the issue from the publishers point of view. As it is now, Google just index their content, make a good money out of it, and then give back only a link to that content. And when publisher wants money for the indexing right, Google just says to them: ""Shut up, be happy that you've got a free link from us."" But... why should the publisher agree with that? They have a full right to ask money for indexing their content.<p>Now, I think this will be interesting. So far, Internet users have a perception that ""there is everything in Google"", and it's also Google's core mission, to index all of the worlds information. But it seems everyone just supposed Google should have a right to index everything for free, so now everyone seems surprised that it's not so.<p>But, it is not Murdoch who drilled a hole to Google's strategy, it was Twitter. Google admitted they are willing to pay for indexing rights, so Murdoch demands the same. I am really curious to see what Google will do about it.",1258968519

957116,comment,955077,956327,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I don't think it's entirely clear yet what direction Azure will take. The base offering using only .NET and Windows with simple storage is priced almost exactly the same as google app engine. It's difficult to compare to Amazon because the architecture is so different. Google and Azure (I believe) won't let you do any serious computation in memory whereas Amazon does support that very well.<p>However, look at SQL Azure. Microsoft thinks that their SQL offering is worth paying 66 times what you pay for google's database (or Azure BLOBs&Tables) and that's just for storage alone ($1 per GB, maxing out at 10GB right now). Add data transfer and you may get to 100 times.<p>Yes SQL Server has vastly more features than google's db, but does it make me 100 times more productive or profitable? I don't think so. If I need more SQL features I could run Postgres on Amazon or use Amazon's MySQL service for roughly 10% of what SQL Azure costs.<p>So if SQL Azure is the model of what's to come then I think it's indeed more of the same.",1258967997

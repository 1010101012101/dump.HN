The author has a job which makes $50k a year, yet he spends $75k a year = earnings < spending.</i><p>That's not a good analogy for a trade deficit. <i>One</i> way of increasing the trade deficit is to borrow money and spend it.  If you mortgage your house to buy books, that certainly increases the ""trade deficit"" with Barnes & Noble.  But someone with, say, a $500K/yr. job could easily afford to spend $75K a year on books, and would run a massive ""trade deficit"" with B&N without going into debt.<p>It's a potential problem if US individuals or the US government go into massive debt, of course, but whether they use that debt to buy foreign or domestic goods is immaterial.  If some of that debt happens to finance the purchase of foreign goods, it drives up the trade deficit, but the problem is the debt, not the deficit.<p>This looks like a linguistic problem as much as anything---people get so hung up on the word ""deficit"". Given its pervasiveness, though, I suspect that causation actually goes the other way: mercantilism is so intuitively appealing that the imprecise terminology seems almost inevitable.",1200711152

Conforming to software standards is one thing; you have to do that to make programs work together. But complying with the W3C's wishes on how the web ought to be used is a very different matter.  I feel like doing exactly what the W3C says on broader questions is not merely optional, but probably a mistake, considering the people who make it up.  It would be like running your company according to a list of ""best practices"" compiled by a committee at General Motors.",1200710444

I thought it was a subset of SGML, which as far as I know was a portable representation for the kind of documents that would ordinarily be seen with a WYSYWG editor.  But even if HTML had been designed to be manipulated by hand, the general trend in technology is always away from that. Machine language was <i>designed</i> to be looked at.

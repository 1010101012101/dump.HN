You&#x27;ve exclusively mentioned virtues that are as common to every culture as they are to every grouping of humans that hasn&#x27;t been designed intentionally to exclude them.<p>Culture largely consists of meals, hairstyles and clothing, dancing and mating habits, religion and racism, architecture, crafts, holidays, and nostalgia over mass media touchstones or memories of common suffering due to weather, famine, dictatorship, and war.<p>When people speak about culture writ large rather than a specific subset, it&#x27;s usually when they&#x27;re accusing foreigners or immigrants of lacking &quot;dedication, concentration, work ethic, attitude, [and] family support&quot; or explaining why the citizens of one&#x27;s own country haven&#x27;t achieved the &quot;dedication, concentration, work ethic, attitude, [and] family support&quot; of some country with more civil rights, and therefore aren&#x27;t ready for more civil rights.",1391615935

I think that trend is going to continue over the next decade or so until everyone uses the internet for video content. But after that I think you&#x27;ll see internet traffic level off to an extent.<p>ISPs need to build out their systems to handle that. I can&#x27;t see anything else causing a dramatic rise in traffic so once they build out their system to handle video content it should be good for awhile.<p>Unfortunately, most ISPs are also cable companies, so naturally they are resistant to spending money just to shoot themselves in the foot. But this trend is going to continue whether they like it or not. It&#x27;s probably going to be a really painful process for the ISPs and their customers. Netflix is going to be trapped in the middle.  The ISPs will want to choke netflix out and take over their business. With net neutrality gone they just might.It&#x27;s going to take some good PR and strategy for netflix to come out of this fight alive.

The health law is projected to result in a voluntary reduction in the work force equal to 2.5 million full-time workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office, not two million fewer jobs.</i><p>If true, this is a good thing. We, as a society, don&#x27;t need &quot;jobs&quot; or hours worked. We need stuff made. Voluntary attrition of the least productive 5-billion person-hours per year won&#x27;t hurt us much, but that will cause wages to rise (which will, over time, improve what is produced).<p>We&#x27;re already producing a lot of stuff.

Because it operates on the nearly universal assumption that life <i>is</i> a game, or a battle, or a scavenger hunt—and the way to win is to maintain a high &#x27;state&#x27; and get lots of &#x27;achievements&#x27;. The reason this gaming terminology is so appealing to us is that it overlays nicely on the way we already think about life: you&#x27;re constantly making some grade or another; you&#x27;re constantly doing better or worse than your peers. A generation ago business was the most appropriate metaphor. But whether our obsession is with who&#x27;s giving us a raw deal and who we&#x27;re getting over on, or where we have advantages and where we have disadvantages (what am I at +1 for?), the basic sensibility doesn&#x27;t change.<p>The perspective here is consistently egoistic. It&#x27;s not even mentioned. It&#x27;s just assumed that the way one goes through life is as an individual, with one&#x27;s own interests solely at heart, and one&#x27;s own state the only thing to be managed. You win by maximizing your own state, by grabbing as many achievements as you can before you die. And even if you&#x27;re not a dick about it, your concerns are very much limited to your states, health level, and the contents of your inventory.<p>This is no way to go through life! It leads to suffering and a small view of things. I&#x27;m really interested to see, actually, what this community makes of that insight. It will dawn on people eventually—or at least its negative will: that everything we&#x27;ve been putting so much damned energy into isn&#x27;t making us happy. But this community is so relentlessly introspective, communicative, articulate, well-equipped, and outright <i>successful</i>. And we have so many blogs like this one: so many people actively, sincerely, unabashedly interested in the science of happiness and fulfillment. So the potential there is pretty big.

The number of endpoints or total nodes in the network is entirely irrelevant, because you have the same 50Mbps whether you&#x27;re drawing it from one AWS server or a thousand BitTorrent peers. The only way you would get the result you&#x27;re assuming is if every endpoint had a fully meshed connection to every other endpoint, i.e. each customer gets 50Mbps to each Amazon server, a separate 50Mbps to each Google server and a separate 50Mbps to every single other user on the internet, for a total of several hundred billion Mbps for every customer. That&#x27;s not how it works.<p>And in practice it&#x27;s even less expensive. It&#x27;s sub-linear. Because just giving everybody a connection which is twice as fast doesn&#x27;t mean <i>everybody</i> is going to immediately double their usage. A large fraction of users, given a faster connection, will do with it only what they currently do with the slower connection. Their pages will load faster but they won&#x27;t load more pages, so the load they put on uplinks to other networks will remain the same.<p>There are no exponentially increasing costs. There are only the same costs as there ever were: Cisco et al come out with a new router that puts twice as many bits through the same piece of cable and if you want those bits you pay them a fixed cost and swap out your old model for the new one, and in another few years you do it again.",1391614564

If an ISP actively throttled Netflix <i>people would leave that ISP for another one that didn&#x27;t throttle Netflix</i> Netflix is clearly a hugely popular service with enough people that it could exercise that clout. Netflix can sign agreements and tout such providers (heck, bundle in sign up offers etc) So the market can solve this problem.<p>Secondly, why are they throttling this service? Because they can&#x27;t charge effectively for it. We all love the simplicity of &quot;all you can eat&quot; pricing. Yet Netflix essentially exploited that model to their own benefit to the point now that model is under risk.<p>I find it fascinating that a service that has (legally and ethically and followed standard biz practices and sensibilities) grown to gobble 30% of all resources and effectively <i>squeezes out other traffic</i> is seen as a victim here.

So it will be even easier for out-of-country advertisers to undercut France&#x27;s local suppliers.<p>The problem is that most citizens don&#x27;t realize just how big the state&#x27;s take on a normal wage is. You believe it&#x27;s ~55% of your income. Well, no.<p>In France, a business has to pay taxes to pay you, then you pay taxes on what you get (to make matters more complicated, these taxes are collected by your employer). In reality your bruto pay is about 130% of what you get quoted (just due to taxes). Out of that 45% remains (taxed at 55%). Then you have local taxes, since you have to live somewhere, these are at least 2% of income. And you add VAT 20% on most things you actually buy. This ignores various other things, like the fact that keeping track of all this requires people, and obviously the state doesn&#x27;t pay for those, so they yet again increase costs for businesses.<p>But let&#x27;s calculate. Out of what your employer pays you in France, you get to spend ...\n100% * (100/130) * 45% * 80% = 27,6%. So the tax rate in France is 72.4%, for a person having a decent job in IT. We&#x27;re not talking bank director here. And of course the French state is raising these levels. Also these are MINIMUM levels (for a decent wage), it&#x27;s assuming you aren&#x27;t investing in stock, assuming you don&#x27;t own a house (or God forbid - more than one house), you don&#x27;t own a car, ... If any of those are not true, you&#x27;ll be paying even more.<p>I think it&#x27;s beyond obvious that this tax level, even if it weren&#x27;t going up, is not sustainable.",1391613403

7184051,comment,7182636,7182636,4,0,pyrrhotech,,,"Very cool and fun.  However, I think we need to stop talking about this 80 years nonsense.  My grandad is 83 and ran a marathon last year.  He still works everyday, and talks about where his company will be 15 years from now.  I have 6 great aunts alive in their 90s or older (I just attended one of my great aunts&#x27; 100th birthday parties over the holidays).<p>The point is that the human body if treated well in the ideal conditions is meant to live 120 years or so.  Over time, litte damages we do to it like not get enough sleep, drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, eat trans fat, take drugs, stress at work add up to years off.<p>No one is perfect, and just about everyone will end up taking a decade or two off this max even if their goal is not to.  But living to 100 while still enjoying life should be everyone&#x27;s goal.  Remember that having a 100 year life span gives you 25% more life than 80.  That&#x27;s a really big difference and enhances your perspective greatly.  I don&#x27;t feel that life is over at 35, in fact it&#x27;s pretty much just getting started.<p>And this is all not counting any technological advances that may enable us to drastically increase our lifespans.  I hope Mr. De Gray and Kurzweil are correct.  But even if they aren&#x27;t, you should shoot for at least 100.",1391612518

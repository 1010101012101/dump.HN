When you're talking about people with an income of $0.65 a day you probably don't have to give them much to help them out significantly. There's undoubtedly genuine need in your country but I doubt you can provide nearly as much assistance per thousand dollars.<p>On the other hand it's much easier to audit the good / harm your charity is doing closer to home and you don't really have the whole neocolonialism concern, so there are arguments for and against both.",1364554747

He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10% of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.

5460092,comment,5459491,5459491,6,0,return0,,,"As an indie developer who had established an online business in cyprus and is now being hardly hit by the bail-in, i agree with a lot of the observations made. Cyprus offers high quality financial services for people who do international business transactions. I am not aware how much of this business is from russian mafiosos, but I was  certainly not one of them.<p>Establishing a business in southern europe is risky anyways in the past 5 years with national governments failing left and right. The red tape and the ability of the state to impose arbitrary ""urgent taxation"" (has happened twice in greece already) hurts all business planning in an already shaky business environment. For me, cyprus was an obvious choice because of its ""most lawful"" status (the country is in the EU and in the euro for years, which requires a high level of transparency, and it is not in considered a tax heaven by OECD), plus when you don't do business in your home country you have the freedom of choice. Compared to the bailed-out european south, cyprus was actually the safest option. From my experience, i did have to provide adequate documentation for all business transactions and the red tape overhead was much reduced.<p>The whole handling of the situation until now is a hugely chaotic freak show, a pretense battle between white knights of capitalism and socialism, and a huge display of how ineffective it is to run europe without a central trustable government.",1364554413

I teach kids to do creative/interesting things with computers. It's hard to get them writing code[0] (it's not a classroom--they come voluntarily and explore what technology topics they like), one of the older (14) kids started out doing that, however, because he wanted to write Minecraft mods. Those are written in Java, in an Eclipse environment working on a decompiled (and only partially annotated) version of the Minecraft .jar. That was <i>not</i> how I envisioned a gentle introduction to computer-programming :) But he was persistent, and got it to work. This only goes to show what's really important: not if the language is simple, complex, elegant, whether the subject matter is easy to grasp, no. It's just a matter of whether the thing they need to learn is on the path towards a goal they really really want to achieve[1].<p>But yes, Minecraft is a huge thing among these kids. Others are cobbling together multi-player servers from scrap computers.<p>While in a sense, brooksbp (sibling comment) is right, there's a LOT going on in these 580 lines of code (I haven't looked at it yet, but I can imagine), 580 lines is not <i>that</i> much either. And if it's something they can run, edit, run, mess around with, see why it broke, edit, run, etc, that's enough to get started. They don't need to understand the whole thing right away. In fact even something as simple (and hardly programming) as changing the colour or textures is awesome because it teaches them that whatever's going on behind those graphics is yours and yours to control (unlike, say, the TV or their aunt's iPhone).<p>That 14 year-old kid is currently experimenting with Unity, trying to make an actual game. Unfortunately, I haven't had time to get acquainted with that environment myself, so I can only give him general advice. I'm way more comfortable with Python (especially a mere 580 lines of it :P) so who knows.<p>[0] Which still mystifies me, I was writing my first lines of BASIC at the age of 9, without help from my parents or anyone except library books and magazines. That probably makes me an outlier, but enough children pass through here that I'd expect to see at least maybe one or two. I guess it's different because back then that machine (an Amstrad PCW) wouldn't do anything interesting except word-processing unless I coded it myself.<p>[1] That was actually a big lesson for me :) I kind of knew it to be the case, but witnessing the process really nailed it down for me.",1364553519

I made, in my best year during that time, $16000. To say that we were poor was an understatement. An extravagant meal for us might be ordering the deluxe tacos at taco bell, or for an anniversary splitting an all you can eat pasta dinner at Olive Garden.<p>But we managed to just squeak by every month with about $5-10 in the bank at the end of the month.<p>We arrived at a point where we had to make a choice, have health insurance (the cheap one through the school) or pay rent and buy groceries. We chose food and shelter.<p>It was the wrong choice.<p>I came down with a mystery pain in my abdomen after recovering from a bad bout with the flu (which I had to work through or we couldn't eat). A night in the ER and a $10k bill later, it was looking like both my wife and I were going to have to drop out of school, we were going to have to break the lease on our apartment and move in with relatives, sell one of our cars and I was going to have to take on a second job sanding decks for $7 an hour.<p>It was too much to bear, my marriage went on the rocks, the relationship with my family and friends went to shit, I mentally shut down. All those years of effort, of dragging myself up the socioeconomic ladder. I became severely depressed.<p>Aggressive negotiation with the hospital saw the bills lowered to a still bankrupting but better $5k and a payment plan. It was the difference between dropping out of school entirely or dropping out for a semester.<p>Then the stars aligned. The bill finally showed up right before the summer break, meaning I could ramp up my work hours and work weekends and nights on a second job. My wife got her work permit which let her take on a part-time job. I got a dollar an hour raise.<p>We crunched the numbers and with aggressive belt tightening we were going to be able to pay off  the bill and not drop out of school or leave our apartment. We worked like crazy, fevered, insane people. And then it happened.<p>We didn't know at the time, but the ER bill was not the final bill, some of the specialists also charged their own bill, and they wouldn't negotiate. Two 10 minute consultations with a surgeon turned into $500. An x-ray here and a couple lab tests and we were still out $1000.<p>We were broken people when those bills came. It was the last straw.<p>Then the next day, out of nowhere, a check from my uncle showed up in the mail for $1000. No strings attached. Pure charity. He had passed the collection plate at his church and asked for help, and those kind people each pitched in a few dollars to help people they'd never met before. And it was that church check that popped out of that envelope.<p><i>Everything</i> turned around after that. Freed of the crushing medical bills, but now with two people working and one less car payment, we finished off our last year of school at a sprint, both got full-time jobs and never looked back. A year out of college we were making enough to buy a house and a second car again. Two years after that we moved up to a nicer house and a better neighborhood and have had amazing careers since then.<p>That $1000 kept my marriage together, got me a degree, kept me from possible suicide, it meant no turning back or crushing dreams, it was the difference between weathering the storm or being blown away by it.<p>Another job wouldn't have helped, I was working over a hundred hours a week. A loan just meant more debt I couldn't pay off. It was pure charity that saved the day and I'll never forget that life lesson.",1364552539

I always believed it is better to teach a man to fish - the best use of this money is to fix the underlying problems.  Lastly, it is more scalable to manufacture food and other goods in a factory.
However, I can see how giving people money would help them better in some ways- they may know better how to spend it and they can invest it, improving more than themselves. 
Perhaps the best solution would be for a type of currency just for charities.  Using this would allow for tracking, which would limit graft. It would also have a social stigma so no one would collect too much and could not be spent on luxury goods.

You could draw slabs of identical blocks as a single cuboid. That will complicate the code, but may allow you to run larger worlds faster. Also, you probably want to be smarter in computing which cubes to draw and what parts of them to draw (in a 'no reflections' world, you can see at most three faces of a cube. There is code for drawing fewer faces on lines 177-185, but that is disabled. If you figure out why, you may be able to improve the code). [My guess would be that the display does not look nice enough if you do. Maybe you will get flicker when looking at blocks near edge conditions (no pun intended)?]<p>Also, keeping angles in degrees means you have to convert to radians on every iteration. It is easy to get rid of that. That will be a tiny, tiny speed up, but if you want to get top speed, you will eventually have to make many of those.<p>Almost every such improvement in speed will come at the cost of code readability and maintainability.",1364551442

Only so many people can invest in land and livestock and farming and know-how before you reach local saturation, only so many people can invest in fishing equipment and know-how before they overfish the local areas, only so many people can invest in starting a business and that know-how and hire other poor people to do something that builds the economy, and so on. Once the low-hanging fruit of personal investment is taken, what then? Or as the economy improves slightly and the average person can more easily afford more vices, will they spiral down in that direction? Or is there a good argument that the low-hanging fruit won't disappear? Or will it not matter because through this type of aid the people will gain the skills necessary to compete in a global market, and that in a decade or two the average person can have a lifestyle approaching the average, say, Eastern European, without direct subsidization? I expect the 130 page report someone linked here addresses my concerns, and I'll add it to my reading queue, but it's not immediately obvious to me that this alone is a sustainable strategy in the sense that eventually no one will need a direct no-strings-attached cash transfer to survive. I think it will just create a dependency that will be perpetually (and increasingly in terms of dollar amount) funded by the richest individuals, corporations, and governments. Maybe that's not such a bad outcome if it's not too expensive relative to the total wealth of these funders and if many people's lifespans generally improve and contain more fun in them.",1364551405

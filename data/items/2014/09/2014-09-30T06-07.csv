So when it comes to decisions by humans, it&#x27;s hard to say which choice is &quot;interfering&quot; with evolution. I would say that, by definition, no human action is interfering with evolution, assuming that humans are the result of evolution. If we do decide to eliminate mosquitoes, well, that just means humans evolved to eliminate mosquitoes, and mosquitoes didn&#x27;t evolve to survive such attempts.",1412060151

More water is used to grow almonds than for all of residential irrigation. There are far more non-farmers than farmers; I expect the next step will be to cut back more on agricultural uses.<p>In a few generations we may look back and wonder why we were flooding fields half a foot deep with increasing scarce water to grow rice in an extremely dry climate. Especially when rice grows perfectly well in areas of the world that actually, you know, get rain all year round.",1412057635

8386963,comment,8382335,8382407,1,0,cs6034,,,"Actually this does have some merit. Cloud Flare once protected Lulzsec servers. The FBI likely established their relationship with CF during this time to monitor all network activity to/from Lulzsec sites.  Now Cloud Flare is the #1 ddos protection service for all sorts of shady sites, all those script kiddies on Hackforums, and everybody else the FBI would like to keep tabs on. CF&#x27;s response to protecting booter services and the like is they don&#x27;t discriminate against customers and remain a so-called neutral party. It would be a goldmine for the FBI to have one US based service with full traffic monitoring of all these persons of interest. A TLS gateway would be an even bigger goldmine.<p>They claim they have never done this but have to comply with warrants and NSLs being US based. Hard to believe the FBI never requested anything from CF back when Lulzsec had dedicated agents after them. They would be incompetent if they didn&#x27;t get data out of CF to help their investigation.",1412057190

They&#x27;re very clear that the code is provided merely for illustrative purposes.<p>Most of the design patterns in the GoF book are actually cribbed/realized in standard libraries of various languages where they work quite well. The problem is, those languages look almost nothing like C++. You could describe it as &quot;biased with OOP&quot;, but it&#x27;s really more that C++&#x27;s peculiarities (value semantics, comparatively complex and tightly coupled inheritance semantics, a purely functional meta-object protocol with very limited reflection semantics, and yes, it&#x27;s multi-paradigm approach) make it serve as a bad fit.<p>Ironically though, much of MCPP is proving C++-style manifestations of GoF design patterns...",1412057139

From what, the people who already live there?<p>The operations in the east were essentially punitive, simply because they didn&#x27;t support the new government.  Yanukovych never sent the army after the protesters, yet the new Kyiv government did...  I don&#x27;t know if you remember the sequence of events, but Donetsk never separated and formed an army until after the massive escalation of violence by the pro-western Ukrainians...<p>> Oh, and by the way, where did the bodies of 4000 dead Russian soldiers go? Wait, how did they get to Ukraine in the first place?<p>If you honestly believe the completely incompetent and inept Ukrainian armed forces could kill 4000 Russian soldiers you&#x27;re insane...  The fact they were routed by a separatist force composed mostly of retired soldiers and volunteers with a few Russian advisers, despite having superior numbers and actually having air forces speaks to their competence, or lack thereof.  By the way, the ceasefire was called because the Ukrainian military had basically given up, and many, if not most of the soldiers were on the verge of disbanding...<p>Odds are they didn&#x27;t even kill that many separatists...",1412056836

1022299,comment,1022296,1022296,0,0,nailer,,,"Hi Hacker News,<p>I was recently wandering around StackOverflow and PyPI and wondering why the only solutions to make MS Office documents from Python seemed to be based around either COM automation, 
OpenOffice automation, or calling Java or .net libraries.<p>So I made this module, which reads and writes Microsoft Office Word 2007 docx files. These are referred to as 'WordML', 'Office Open XML' and 'Open XML' by Microsoft.<p>They can be opened in Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Mac Office 2008, OpenOffice.org 2.2, and Apple iWork 08.<p>The docx module has the following features:<p>Making documents<p>• Paragraphs<p>• Bullets<p>• Numbered lists<p>• Multiple levels of headings<p>• Tables<p>Editing documents<p>Thanks to lxml module, we can:<p>• Search and replace<p>• Extract plain text of document<p>• Add and delete items anywhere within the document<p>• Run xpath queries against particular locations in the document - useful for retrieving data from user-completed templates.<p>It's only a couple of hundred lines - lxml does most of the heavy work - but it's incredibly simple to use, check out example.py in the link.<p>Hope you find it useful.<p>Mike",1262173942

Of course theoretically this attack is known for quite some time, but making it practical by providing the equipment and rainbow tables is new.<p>Interesting enough they planned to do a workshop today, where you could bring your GSM data and they wanted to try to decrypt it.

1022297,comment,1022244,1022244,0,0,antirez,,,"I think the problem with markdown is that it's too complex to write a good parser in a few lines of code, otherwise there would be no ""open source obligations"" issues at all, because what is really needed in a markup system is that it is widely accepted, all the rest will follow, <i>unless</i> the format is so complex to implement well that most of the implementations will be hacks.<p>I also don't like how it looks from the human point of view, but this is just my opinion and I guess it's not very common as my feeling is that most people love markdown.<p>Given that this is the standard de facto at this point I guess that what's really needed is to write an high quality, fast, simple, reference implementation written in an algol-like language (guess what? The good Haskell implementation does not qualify), and share it under a BSD license so that it will be both the specification and the reference implementation everybody will use to derivate their Python / Ruby / C / ... solid implementations of markdown.<p>This is the perfect project to emerge in the coding community with little efforts if you are smart. It's a few days of work and it is very useful to many people, so what are you waiting for? :) Get some coffee and start coding now instead to waste all your time on hacker news! Then setup a page for your code and write a blog article explaining what are the hard part and tradeoffs about implementing markdown, and possibly how markdown could be enhanced. Don't worry, most of us understand that what you produced is FREE and will just praise you, without obligations ;)",1262173772

1022292,comment,1021706,1021706,0,0,NikkiA,,,"It's a largely irrelevant question for the simple fact that <i>IF</i> the twins have separate brains and thus are not one entity, then the second twin is almost certainly guilty of conspiracy and/or being an accomplice to any act that twin #1 does. Thus both twins will require punishment anyway.<p>If the second twin informs on the first, then the situation put forward in the hypothetical question can arise, but that's not very likely.<p>There are a few situations where the crime isn't serious enough to warrant a serious punishment for being a conspirator or accomplice, but those can probably be dealt with by a more lenient form of punishment on the first twin - house arrest over prison time, etc. That would be up to the judge in such a case, and such a judge is likely to receive medical/psychological advice on sentencing in such a rare and usual case.<p>Conjoined twins are likely to remain a rare enough occurance that we don't really need to ponder the legal issues of punishment until they're needed, and codifying them as a special case is probably not necessary.",1262173157

The right tool for accessing half a petabyte of data on unreliable Xeon-based servers in bakery racks is <i>NOT</i> a distributed database.  MapReduce... is.<p>Oh, and one last thing -- he should be comparing BigTable with a standard RDBMS if he wanted to have so much as a single shred of credibility.  Google uses traditional RDBMSes internally -- but not for the heavy lifting of indexing and caching.  Because <i>an RDBMS is a shitty tool for that job</i>.  That's one reason why the founders are rich as all get out -- they didn't worry about which tourniquet to use while the patient bled out.  Stupid fucking religious wars.",1200639455

Did you do it manually?<p>And yes, just like with a lot of other things, it's about quality and not quantity of submissions. The interest of users of this site is pretty clear so if you submit links that are meaningful to them, there's a good chance you'll get upmoded. But as I said, I don't really care about karma... I get nothing for it anyway :).<p>I view submitting stuff here as a thanks to others that do the same. I can't even begin to express the thanks to others that have introduced me to so many different concepts that have cut down our development time by months.",1200638256

And with no documentation and a less than stellar credit rating, plus little down, they were nuts to grant it to me.<p>Luckily for me I didn't purchase the condo, as the housing market there took a nosedive, and I'd currently be unable to sell for less than I'd owe the bank.",1200636039

Here is Larry Page on that.<p><i>“If you really think about the things that you need to make yourself happy—housing, security, opportunities for your kids—anthropologists have been identifying these things. It’s not that hard for us to provide those things,” he said. “The amount of resources we need to do that, the amount of work that actually needs to go into that is pretty small. I’m guessing less than 1% at the moment. So the idea that everyone needs to work frantically to meet people’s needs is just not true.”<p>“You just reduce work time,” Page said. “Most people, if I ask them, ‘Would you like an extra week of vacation?’ They raise their hands, 100% of the people. ‘Two weeks vacation, or a four-day work week?’ Everyone will raise their hand. Most people like working, but they’d also like to have more time with their family or to pursue their own interests. So that would be one way to deal with the problem, is if you had a coordinated way to just reduce the workweek. And then, if you add slightly less employment, you can adjust and people will still have jobs.”</i><p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/07/07/googles-larry-page-on-the-40-hour-work-week-jm-keynes-got-there-first/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/07/07/googles-l...</a>",1417413292

There are a lot many things that &quot;engineers&quot; (non-software) have to take account of, even in something as mundane as laying out a road. In this example, you not only have to build the road within the area; you have to build it so that it has the right curvature so that vehicles can make the turn etc. You have to make sure that the road you&#x27;re laying out has a solid base; you need to make sure that the road can withstand the natural forces of that region for whatever time it is designed to last against. So I don&#x27;t understand how engineers build against gravity.<p>But if you&#x27;re saying that engineering has to <i>follow the laws of physics</i>, then yes, I&#x27;m totally on board. Computer Science departments in most universities started of as branches within the mathematics department. While most of software engineering is more than simple math; it does operate on its own plane, with no regard for the laws of physics (except maybe of time :) ).<p>In that regards, Software Engineering seems more of an art, doesn&#x27;t it?

Short answer: generally you refer to them as if they have always publicly identified with their current gender.<p>Longer answer: The overarching idea is to respect the person&#x27;s wishes and stated identity. In most cases, and certainly in Rebecca Heineman&#x27;s case from what I&#x27;ve read, she always identified as female even when she was known as Bill Heineman. So out of respect we would typically refer to her as Rebecca (or with female pronouns) no matter which part of her life we&#x27;re referring to.<p>There could be exceptions. In some cases, a person&#x27;s former gender might be directly relevant to a story. (Imagine you&#x27;re writing about a person, now female, who was sent to a boy&#x27;s boarding school as a child.

Take HTTP for example: it&#x27;s a large complex protocol that requires plenty of code to handle correctly (e.g. the size of a request, and the various pieces inside it, are not specified and the parser has to read through the whole request sequentially to figure this out), and the majority of applications using it never need the full functionality. What if it was a simpler, easier-to-parse format that was as extensible?<p>One of the points I get from his argument is that encapsulation has encouraged us to build massively overcomplicated systems by piling layers upon layers with little understanding of how everything fits together, when we could instead be building much simpler and more efficient systems that could still be using abstraction but in a far more cautious manner.",1417412464

8679683,comment,8678847,8679023,0,0,Animats,,,"That&#x27;s to some extent by design. When organic search works perfectly, the user goes directly from the search result to their desired destination. The search engine makes no money from that.  This is the fundamental conflict of the search engine business. When Brin and Page originally tried to sell their technology to Yahoo, Yahoo rejected it because it was &quot;too good&quot; - users would immediately leave Yahoo.<p>Now Google has that problem for itself. About a third of Google&#x27;s revenue is from AdSense (non-search ads). It&#x27;s not in Google&#x27;s interest for their anti-spam efforts to be too tough on made-for-Adsense sites. They crack down only on the outrageous cases.  This became very clear in the &quot;Sportsdrugs.com&quot; case, where Google was caught in an FBI drug sting and paid $500,000,000 to avoid prosecution.<p>If you want to understand how Google really works, read the black hat SEO forums. Every time Google tries something new in search ranking, it&#x27;s reverse engineered in a few weeks.  
Trying to detect SEO with machine learning based on page contents worked for a while, but now the SEO guys use machine learning too. &quot;Automated SEO&quot; tries to automatically reverse-engineer Google&#x27;s anti-spam algorithms, then adjusts pages and links until the SEO&#x27;s model of Google says the page is under the threshold where Google will consider it spam.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard to detect web spammers, if you&#x27;re willing to do a quick background check on the company behind each web site.  This can be automated; see our &quot;sitetruth.com&quot;. Large numbers of spam domains trace back to the same source, so dealing with the problem on a per-business basis rather than a per-domain basis works.<p>Google has a monopoly on mind share, but only about 2/3 of US search.  Bing (including Yahoo, which resells Bing) has about half the search volume Google does. That&#x27;s historically about where Chrysler has been relative to General Motors.  Yet Chrysler is taken seriously as an competitor to GM, while Bing is not taken seriously as a competitor to Google. It&#x27;s not clear why. There&#x27;s no network effect in search; it matters if your friends are on Facebook, but not if they&#x27;re searching with Bing.<p>Bing has a very low public profile.  It&#x27;s hard to even find out who&#x27;s in charge there. (Searching with Bing won&#x27;t help.) Previously, it was Satya Nadella, who moved up to being CEO of Microsoft. There is no Bing CEO any more. Bing is under Microsoft&#x27;s Online Services Division, headed by Qi Lu. Different parts of Bing are under four different parts of Online Services.

If your imagination is big enough then you&#x27;ll be hand writing your own additions in no time. So long as your applications runs on the major browsers latest-1 without issue there isn&#x27;t a reason to upgrade. If you&#x27;re writing a project there isn&#x27;t a reason to make a framework jump, and if Angular 1 to 2 is that different, consider it a framework jump. Why feel bad about not knowing your way around when you go from one framework to another, would you feel the same going from Drupal to Wordpress? They are both CMSs, both PHP, both extended far beyond their initial goals. Angular 1 will go into maintenance if Angular 2 is that different, development will slow, and eventually you&#x27;ll upgrade to Angular 3, which is incompatible with Angular 2, but after years of having a working application.<p>I&#x27;ve gone from Angular, to Kendo, to Ember, to Backbone. If you want to make an &#x27;investment&#x27; in knowledge of front-end development learn the plain JavaScript, read through the framework you&#x27;re using. Walk through the execution, that will allow you as a developer-for-hire to pickup the newest shiny on a new team with less issues.<p>Web development has always had this pace, whatever tool or setup you commit too, the next week someone will call you an idiot for using it.

The claim for Rust is that it&#x27;s memory-safe without a garbage collector.<p>In C#, D, Go, and Java, arrays are implemented as language primitives in the runtime. Their runtimes are implemented in raw C or C++ and are not formally verified. So my question is: Why is implementing an array in C as a language primitive safer than implementing it in the standard library via unsafe code?<p>There&#x27;s a similar story for the swap operation. Rust in fact used to have a swap operation, as you suggested, but it was removed because such an operation can easily be implemented in the library. We could have moved the code back into the compiler, but how would that have made the language safer? (In fact, I would be tempted to argue that implementing language primitives in codegen is <i>less</i> safe, since programmatically generating LLVM IR is more difficult than writing essentially C with a different syntax.)",1417411722

We do not allow unsafe core layout code to be checked into the tree; the only unsafe code in layout is general code that manages relatively simple invariants.<p>The question that matters is: Can you write high-performance code in Rust <i>without</i> writing unsafe code of your own?

Especially since you&#x27;re a long-established contributor to the world of tech using your real name and I&#x27;m using a week-old moniker representing a Mexican food product. Some history:<p>I&#x27;m somewhat bedazzled by Reddit&#x27;s /r/personalfinance group. It&#x27;s a weird mix of debt support group, FICO score obsessive-compulsives, bots posting FAQ entries, and what appears to be 14 year olds who watch that guy who yells on the finance channel instead of doing their algebra homework repeating the same boilerplate advice over and over regardless of what the panicked, desperate OP declares is his unique financial situation and needs.<p>Between that, pg&#x27;s insane essay yesterday on &quot;being mean&quot;, and a discussion with a knucklehead here last week who didn&#x27;t understand dilution or liquidity, your post caught me at an odd time.<p>My first problem with your post is that it lacks context. It goes from &quot;gee shucks here&#x27;s some dumb shit I did&quot; to vague recommendations straight out of elementary school economics to &quot;choose a credit union -- but not the one I chose&quot; to suddenly talking about donor-assisted charity funds and maintaining your own mini-index fund by purchasing 75 stocks. You also use the phrase &quot;sunshine tax&quot; referring to weather just to make sure it&#x27;s a big ol&#x27; swirl of mixed metaphors.<p>As someone who&#x27;s only previously read your stuff when you&#x27;re outlining guidelines (and teasing vague hints) of how not to piss off Googlebot, it&#x27;s a little weird.<p>It&#x27;s the same problem /r/personalfinance faces. It&#x27;s not clear how old you are, where you live, what your marital/child situation is, what your health is, what your parent&#x27;s health is, what your values are, or just how fucking rich you are. I don&#x27;t blame you for not saying it and I don&#x27;t want to know. But without that, you&#x27;re a talking head spouting finance with no track record and no background, and you&#x27;re saying nothing that I haven&#x27;t heard from that blonde lady with the fancy haircut or the Reddit finance bot.<p>It&#x27;s the blogger&#x27;s curse, one I find myself asking whenever I start clicking around the web: why did you write this post, who the hell are you, and why should I take you seriously?<p>You lost your shirt on Cisco, you nearly lost it all with unsecured notes, and now you&#x27;re giving me advice about securities? Um, ok. Paul Graham&#x27;s doing his Dale-Carnegie-On-A-Bumper-Sticker schtick, I guess why not?<p>Context aside, some specifics relating to your article:<p>1. You are probably a bad stock picker<p>Should read &quot;I am a bad stock picker.&quot; Overlaps with &quot;just buy an index.&quot; Also, for support you link to an article written by someone who was banned for life from the securities industry.<p>2. No one cares about your money as much as you do<p>No one cares about your health as much as you do either. That doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t visit a doctor when there&#x27;s a lump in your ballsack. The world isn&#x27;t melting and there are trustworthy financial organizations. Though I&#x27;d sure love to know why Google Finance sucks so hard. Financial news is a bot-filled hellhole, and given its highly keyworded nature with ticker symbols included, Google still insists on showing me blurbs from an Oregon utility (Portland General electric company) instead of GE, the 9th largest corporation on the planet. Nice scripts, dude. Reminds me of the time Google Translate autodetected Gesundheit as Spanish.<p>3. Wall Street is not your friend<p>This is a &quot;hard won&quot; lesson for you? How exactly were you maimed by the lack of regulation on Wall Street? You weren&#x27;t even holding securities and you still made out okay. Also... capitalism? Zero sum? This is news?

Let&#x27;s meet back in 5 years and see how that worked out, deal?<p>5. Prefer index funds<p>Fascinating. 50/50 stock/bond split you say? And a plug for Vanguard LifeStrategy?

And did you just link to that shitty site run by the guy banned for life from the securities industry again? Yes, yes you did.<p>6. Prefer credit unions over banks<p>&quot;Wall Street is like [sic] carnival sideshow designed to separate you from your money.&quot; Really, dude? Half the credit unions in the US have less than $20 million in assets. Call me weird but I&#x27;d like my bank to be worth more money than I am. Deposit a couple six figure checks and you&#x27;ll learn fast where service comes from at even the shittiest Bank of America branch. They&#x27;ll give you more than lollipops. And, bonus: they can afford to make an Android app. Credit unions are great, except when they suck. Check yours, read the fine print, then consider that getting direct deposit to the bank that has ATMs everywhere might work out just the same on fees and better interest rates on savings to boot. And with an Android app!<p>7. Prefer Vanguard over almost anyone else<p>&quot;I consider them one of the only companies on your side in the financial world.&quot; What an odd endorsement. Have you exhaustively researched the other discount brokers and their services? E-trade for individual 401ks? Schwab for low-deposit requirements across the board, extensive checking/banking options (varies by state)? Chase/Wells Fargo for HSAs? A not insane recommendation would be &quot;use Vanguard as a baseline, they&#x27;re tough to beat.&quot; And maybe keep your financial industry ethical intuition to yourself?<p>8. You probably don’t need a “assets under management” financial advisor<p>Another dubious section but CLEARLY should refer to the need for a tax advisor and/or estate planner. Two posts upthread I&#x27;m arguing with a guy who doesn&#x27;t know how interest is taxed.

While one can nit-pick about React.js rendering performance in its internal &quot;DOM diff&quot; model or Flux&#x27;s &quot;data flow architecture&quot; in improving code readability, but they are just buzzwords to me like words-play in a post-modern novel or art that arrange concepts in their idiosyncratic way in an arbitrary aesthetic way; although sometimes the rearrangements can be beautiful, they are ultimately shrines to themselves and their creators and subculture.<p>Subculture because everyone wants something of their own and ignore interoperability. Although the data model are the same whether you&#x27;re a single-page or isomorphic, there is no community standard to define standards to define your data models a la J2EE annotations or code-generated one&#x27;s a la Google Protobuf.

The idea that you can mine raw minerals on an asteroid and somehow turn them into a house with a full life support is not realistic, to put it mildly.<p>> Also, keep in mind there are a lot of global catastrophes that could easily wipe out our civilization.<p>If you want to save the scientific and technological knowledge that makes a civilization, there are certainly cheaper and more efficient ways to do it than spending hundreds of billions in order to have a few people living in an hostile environment.

Part of that is in libraries, but an even bigger part of it is in the tooling that people use to build JavaScript applications.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see all of these new things flying by, combined with changes to JavaScript itself, and feel completely overwhelmed. To be honest, over the past two years, even as a maintainer of Ember, I have experienced very serious hype fatigue.<p>This is a large part of the reason behind Ember&#x27;s philosophy of finding and implementing strategies for stability without stagnation. On the one hand, people (including us) are tired of the constant barrage of new tools and techniques. On the other hand, it would be terrible to get beaten by a competitor that discovered a wonderfully productive new solution. The Ember team has spent the last few years honing a process for dealing with these conflicting desires.<p>That process involves:<p>* six-week release cycles, so every new change is incremental and adds value on its own<p>* canary, beta, and release channels (just like browsers), so that people will more appetite for churn can help test out features, and get them stable by the time they ship as part of a final release<p>* SemVer, so upgrading across final releases is relatively painless and the biggest part of our community can take advantage of the improvements as they roll out<p>* having each member of the core team build apps that we care about and maintain, so that we can feel the competing costs of maintenance and keeping pace with the latest and greatest first hand<p>The core ideas come from shipping browsers, which have had to deal with requirements of very strong stability with an increasing desire to &quot;go fast&quot;. The pace of new browser features has been so good, in fact, that they have been used as an argument in favor of completely breaking things and starting over.<p>Ironically, the browser instead shows us that if we want to avoid stagnation, we are going to have to have strategies for bringing people along. Stability without stagnation is not a paradox; it&#x27;s a recipe for success.<p>(we talked a lot more about the nitty-gritty technical details in the previously discussed Ember 2.0 RFC: <a href=""https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15</a>)",1417410840

Then I moved away from C# and Windows to Linux and DevOps stuff. At that point, I started to use Vim fulltime. Getting into it, I saw you could keep your configuration in a dotfiles repository, so that you didn&#x27;t need to remember how to setup a billion plugins on a new OS install (although admittedly, that&#x27;s true for any editor) and that was when I seriously invested time in getting a good setup.<p>Now, I just can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything else. No matter how good you seem to get, you just never stop learning stuff about it that makes it easier to do your work. Initially I was afraid of not having intellisense, as I&#x27;d developed what I consider to be a bit of a crutch on that, from years and years of using VS. But, it turns out, you can get very near IDE like intellisense with plugins like YouCompleteMe. For me, the approximation is acceptable, due to all the other power that comes with Vim.<p>I also love that I can use it in the terminal (I don&#x27;t use gvim) and still have it look fantastic, meaning, using it along with tmux, I rarely need to leave the terminal for anything now. I like that, because it means I get to learn how to do everything really fast on the command line, without the aid of a mouse. I really just consider the whole command line environment to be my IDE now, and I love it!<p>I do have to admit though, if I was still doing Java or C#, I&#x27;d probably still keep the IDE around for doing big refactors and some code analysis. Now though, I&#x27;m mostly using dynamic languages and bash scripting, so the full IDE isn&#x27;t as necessary (at least I haven&#x27;t found it to be, so far).",1417410638

So here&#x27;s what I came up with (still work-in-progress):<p>The most simple program is easily done in assembly- or basic-style program - straight sequence of control instructions. The program starts with a set of data, constructs an intermediate data structure, a state graph, iterates on that graph in a simple sequence of commands, mutating it, collects output from the graph and then terminates.<p>When a program gets more complicated, we break sequence of commands into subsequences (subroutines/functions/etc). Each subroutine can be understood in isolation from others, which is a great win, but it still interacts directly with various pieces of the state graph, which limits our ability to reason about its effects.<p>Next we carve out individual pieces of the application state graph, and proclaim that each such piece can only be directly accessed by a small amount of code married to that piece of data. Such code and data married together are called an &quot;object&quot;, and the entire approach is &quot;object-oriented&quot;. Thus to reason about a subroutine we only need to look at its code in terms of its interaction with the &quot;object&quot; abstractions, rather than with the raw state graph data. Since abstractions are simpler than their implementations, it gives us extra ability to understand and thus create larger programs.<p>Implicit in the last two approaches is mutability - as the graph state changes, the same pieces of code continue to have access to it, and thus are expected to accomodate the drifting state. That is, the same chunks of code are expected to operate with a number of different states of the graph, corresponding to different stages in the lifecycle of the data.<p>An alternative way to cut down on complexity is &quot;pure functional&quot;. In this approach each piece of code operates directly on the entire data graph, but only at a single stage of the lifecycle - it would iterate over an input readonly graph, then produce a new output readonly graph as a result, to be fed into the next stage of the pipeline.<p>So we have two dimensions - data and time. If we narrow down the data dimension, we end up with object-oriented approach. If we squish the time dimensions to a single point, we end up with pure-functional approach. The third dimensions - sequence of commands, is split up into smaller chunks in either of the two approaches.",1417410284

(Which you should never do on the web, specifically because &quot;underline&quot; means &quot;link&quot; and nothing else; however, in non-hypertext, underlining can work as a visual style.)<p>However, as a style for <i>links</i>, it has a sufficiently different style that I find it distracting, both from .  appearing far too faint to stand out, and from introducing breaks in the line.  It isn&#x27;t <i>nearly</i> as bad as sites that hide link underlines entirely, however.",1417410212

Given programmers wages vs. cost of CPU/RAM/storage, and the long term trends (technology makes one cost lower, the other cost higher!), it is economically insane to reject encapsulation.<p>I definitely see the appeal viewing programming as craft. In that case, its no coincidence that &quot;reinventing wheels&quot; is good advice to learn how to program. Its just not how to run a business.",1417410073

I think that often in practical conditions the abstract models are not the area under work. They are the <i>mapping</i> of the area to some formal system. And that the &#x27;area&#x27; under question - whatever it may be  - can be mapped to an infinite amount of formal systems. For lots of practical purposes, there is some &#x27;obvious&#x27; algebra of a thing one wants to do - in these instances all that is needed is an individual who can map the problem to any logically coherent structure, even just a private one in their head, and a willingness to solve the problem - and great stuff can ne done without a literature review.  Sometimes the establishes models are really, really good since they either simplify a messy looking problem and/or point out to some not so obvious aspects of a system at which point an expert in the field can have an advantage over the clever layman. I think sometimes the knowledge of existing formal models can make a person blind to certain facets of the system they are working with.<p>Also, if one approaches a thing by a burning desire just to implement one single thing on top of it they will probably have an internal model that is very much focused on the problem they are solving.This practical need can induce them to create a new formal model or just sidestep lots of non-issues that would be a burden to deal with.",1417410004

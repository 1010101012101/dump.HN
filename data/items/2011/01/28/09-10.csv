It's the philosophy of SOAP being ""message-passing"" taken to the extreme.<p>You have the SOAP messages which envelopes (sigh) yet another message-level architecture where every request, even at OO level means constructing request-objects with millions of sub-properties, all types fitting an abstract inheritance tree. Which ofcourse is also what you get returned after sending your request. So then you have to start analyzing your <i>response</i> object (again a message-object enveloped in a SOAP-message) and anaylze what class it <i>actually</i> is and the same for all subproperties.<p>I don't mind SOAP so much, but EWS can really go die in a fire. You can say whatever you want about SOAP in general, but EWS cannot really be used as an example of anything other than itself. I've never seen such a painful and convoluted solution anywhere else.<p>Even if SOAP had been ditched and the wire-format used had been some sort of RESTFul implementation, it would still be a clusterfuck to use.

Kinect Sports's menu UX is not quite as good and Dance Central is so-so.

It also depends on what exactly you'd want to study; a lot depends on finding a supportive advisor who would be willing to supervise the kind of thesis you want to work on. This depends not only on the style of work, but also the specific domain, e.g. you're going to get a totally different set of candidates if you're interested in, say, interactive entertainment (there's a sub-field of game AI, AI-for-narrative, etc.) or perhaps something to do with robotics (also its own subfield), or else something to do with human-computer interactions (something vaguely in HCI, CSCW, etc.).<p>""Big AI"" isn't very much in favor currently, partly for good reasons and partly for bad reasons. There's a strong worry about being too unrigorous or philosophical or vague or even sci-fi. Academic AI probably overcorrects for a fear of being seen like crazy singularity-mongers, and there's also a legacy of having over-promised some big-AI stuff in the '50s and '60s. Most funding is also for more concrete technical projects, though there is a subset of people doing some funded research in the area of artificial creativity and creativity support (Margaret Boden and Gerhard Fischer are two entry points into that literature).<p>So, most research tends to be much narrower and investigate specific empirical or mathematical questions, like whether a particular reinforcement-learning algorithm converges, or how to improve an object-tracking algorithm, or something of that sort. Even in Cog Sci departments, the theses tend to be more specific, like doing an eye-tracking study that investigates some question about perception. To the extent the ""bigger picture"" stuff gets done at all, there's a feeling that it's a late-career thing people like Hofstadter can get away with, but it's harder to do as a PhD thesis.<p>Not sure that actually answered your question, but the short version is: it's hard to get in a position where you can study the kind of stuff discussed in GEB, <i>but</i> if you can think of more specific technical questions on the peripheries of your big-picture interests, it may be more doable.",1296206382

You can still see the gory details of URLs and HTTP requests surfaced quite clearly, and the experience of using the web is that much richer if you know what they are and how to manipulate them. Firefox doesn't actively prevent you from doing so if you want to, which it would if it was trying to present a sealed abstraction.<p>Contrast with IEs 'friendly' error messages by default. Instead of an easily diagnosed 'page not found', or 'address not found', or 'server error' you get 'something went wrong' and then a list of <i>always</i> incorrect guesses as to what the problem might be and a confusing list of irrelevant things you can try to 'fix' the problem.

2151271,comment,2150677,2151131,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Personally, I don't think the TV makers will be smart enough for a while to open their platforms to software developers in a way that is attractive enough for developers to really embrace it. It'll be to the Android Market what the Android Market is to the iOS App Store. Android Market seems to be just about good enough, whereas the App Store is a roaring success. Anything worse than the Android Market is probably going to be a failure.<p>And: Software? Yes, software. It's playing an increasingly large role in <i>all</i> consumer electronics. When I look at the average TV's kafkaesque OSD menus I have very little faith that they won't fuck up something more complicated. Even if Android develops a big screen offshoot, most TV makers will fuck up the implementation, if the majority of Android phones and tablets is anything to go by. The mindset of the hardware makers still is such that the software is an afterthought. It's increasingly becoming the make or break component.<p>The current lot of ""smart"" TVs certainly reflects that attitude - they can't even get web browsing right on a most basic level.<p>This gives Apple, Boxee, etc. a chance to establish themselves in that market with boxes that are separate from the TV itself. Game consoles are in that category as well, except they're expensive and (still) have a ""gamer"" stigma associated with them. I understand the Xbox's non-game UI is actually pretty good, so Microsoft could probably release a cheap Xbox without the expensive CPU, GPU and DVD drive, which does everything but play (AAA) games. Extend XBLA to non-game apps. And for god's sake don't call it Xbox, that will transfer the stigma.<p>Btw, Sony will probably miss this opportunity because their TV division is separate from the PlayStation one. And Nintendo, well, no idea. They don't really seem to get the Internet. But they've surprised us before. (they have the Opera browser on the Wii!)",1296205395

97090,comment,96769,96769,0,0,Tichy,,,"I seem to have heard the same kind of answer from the Rails community before: ""do it yourself if you really care"". I don't blame DHH for it, but I think it is interesting to note the difference to the major Java frameworks I know, like Spring. I think they care a lot more about their community and the popularity of their framework.<p>Apparently since DHH built Rails for his own use, he doesn't care if anybody else uses it or not. Although I wonder how much the popularity of Rails contributes to the success of 37signals - would anybody even know about their web applications if it wasn't for the Rails hype?<p>In any case, that kind of thing is why people still choose Java over Ruby.",1200037571

The episode Steve Wozniak describes in iWoz, playing pranks with the remote control a few decades ago, OK, it was weird and sort of interesting, although I am also glad that I was not the victim of his joke. But to copy that kind of thing now, I really don't get it. At least Wozniak built his own remote control.<p>Sorry to rant about it, but it seems to me to be the same mentality as the script kiddies, it's just plain annoying and making the lifes of everybody else harder.",1200037115

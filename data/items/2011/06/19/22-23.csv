2672204,comment,2671907,2671907,21,0,jrspruitt,,,"""Call your dad on fathers day"" as politically incorrect? This seems like overkill. There is a 1000 other vastly more important things to get worked up over. Its not like Google took your dad away or made him someone you despise, and then flaunts how great it is having a dad you'd want to honor on fathers days in front of you. It's a little something to give their service a slight personality. Perhaps its like Field of Dreams, give people somewhere to complain, they will complain, which is fine, but complain about the problem, the people that caused it, not the things that remind you of it, which end up getting those things taken away from the majority of people that would enjoy the rather innocent reminder.I could see being pissed off if you were in jail for a crime you didn't commit, and you were being forced to celebrate the 4th of July or something, but this is not even close to that.",1308524391

2672202,comment,2671632,2671632,2,0,TheSkeptic,,,"* Everybody else on your team is an engineer or developer. Obviously, this doesn't mean you <i>can't</i> be successful (I know, I know - look at Google), but you should consider the possibility that you're probably missing vital skills needed to compliment your startup's technical prowess. From UX to business development, you have to get a lot right to turn a great product into a great <i>business</i>, and that can be difficult when you have three other chefs in the kitchen who all cook the same cuisine.<p>* Starting a business with three close friends seems nice on paper, but don't assume that good friends necessarily make for good business partners.<p>* Talk about arbitrary dollar amounts calls into question not just your sense of reality, but your motivations. Can your startup raise $1 million? Perhaps. Will you have $10 million in cold hard cash in two years? Perhaps. But you could buy a lottery ticket and win the same amount within the next two years too. If you wouldn't plan your life around a potential financial windfall from a lottery ticket, why would you plan your life around a potential financial windfall from a startup? The number of self-made 24 year-olds with $10 million-plus net worths is quite small, but you probably already know that.",1308524352

2672171,comment,2669316,2669316,2,0,pash,,,"Glossed over in the video, and in the discussion here so far, is that <i>even when a court rules a derivative work to infringe a copyright</i>, there's no need to obtain a license so long as the derivative work is ""creative enough"" to qualify as fair use under US copyright law (and  similarly in many other jurisdictions).  So while it's true that the Sixth Circuit ruled in 2005 [1] that unlicensed samples of any duration constitute copyright infringement, what's left unsaid is that samples still may be used without bothering about licenses so long as they're used as part of a sufficiently creative new song.<p>But what's ""creative enough""?  Ah, there's the rub.<p>The real story here is how copyright owners are able to abuse a quirk of the law in order to strong-arm musicians into paying licensing fees, even when everybody knows full well there's probably no legal obligation to pay them.  ""Sample trolls"" exist precisely because fair use is only a <i>defense to litigation</i>, which means it can only be invoked in the course of a lawsuit.  So there's no sure way to know whether you need to license your use of a sample until you get sued, you claim fair use, and a judge tells you whether you should have (past tense) bought a license or not.  It's much cheaper, of course, just to pay for a license up front and be done with it.<p>Unfortunately, its hard to imagine a way to resolve this conundrum if copyright holders are still to be granted monopolies over derivative works [2].  Consider the canonical law-school example of a derivative work, Marcel Duchamp's goteed Mona Lisa (<i>LHOOQ</i>) [3].  If Leonardo had been around to defend his copyright, would Marcel have been able successfully to invoke the fair-use defense? It all depends on how creative the judge thinks it is to give old Lisa a mustache.  Reasonable judges may disagree.<p>And then consider Andy Warhol's colorful posterized Mona Lisa silkscreens, or Kazimir Malevich's collage-cum-painting <i>Composition with Mona Lisa</i>, which incorporates a small copy of Leonardo's painting. Even if you thought Marcel's work was a blatant rip-off, you might think Andy's or Kazimir's is fair use.  (Then there's Salvador Dali's <i>Self Portrait as Mona Lisa</i>.)  Point is, it's impossible to draw a bright line on fair use, even for a particular work.<p>But that's not to say there's no bright line anywhere.  When it comes to recorded music, one such line is whether a work actually incorporates a copy of the recording.  If it's not a sample, but a new recording that happens to sound the same, there's no issue.  (A ruling that duplicating any portion of a musical <i>composition</i> constitutes infringement is nigh unimaginable.) So just go record your own version of the beat you want to use and there's no issue.<p>1: See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeport_Music,_Inc._v._Dimension_Films"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeport_Music,_Inc._v._Dimen...</a> ; a good write-up on the case is at <a href=""http://www.ivanhoffman.com/fairusemusic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ivanhoffman.com/fairusemusic.html</a> .<p>2: And maybe they shouldn't be.  But then the debate would probably turn back to what constitutes a derivative work.<p>3: This and other riffs on the Mona Lisa are shown at <a href=""http://www.aiwaz.net/gallery/mona-lisa-as-modern-lisa/gc234"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aiwaz.net/gallery/mona-lisa-as-modern-lisa/gc234</a> .<p>By the way, for those of you who doubt the ubiquity and permutivity of the Amen Break in today's hip-hop, here are a few tracks I picked out in a quick once-over of two albums by The Roots.  From almost-a-sample to you-gotta-be-paying-attention, these all use the Amen Break:<p>- ""Rolling with Heat"" (slowed down, but otherwise almost unchanged)<p>- ""Thought @ Work"" (syncopated by dropping a beat)<p>- ""Duck Down!"" (very slow, syncopated)<p>- ""I Don't Care"" (syncopated)<p>- ""Web"" (very syncopated)<p>- ""Boom!"" (very syncopated)<p>If you can hear the signature ""bum bum BAH, buh-DUM buh-DUM"" in those last few, you can see why people call it the most ubiquitous break.

9419033,comment,9417171,9418735,0,0,garrettr_,,,"Even if the Yubikey supported larger RSA keys (3072 or 4096-bit), you might not want to use them. Decryption is quite slow with a 4096-bit key on a smartcard (for example, it takes ~5 seconds to decrypt with a 4096-bit key using a g10code smartcard), which seriously hampers usability. Increasing RSA key size also has diminishing security returns [0], so in an ideal world you&#x27;d be using ECC instead, to get a strong 256-bit security level with good performance. Unfortunately, both the OpenPGP smartcard spec and smartcard hardware need to be updated to add support for ECC (and who knows how long that might take).<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that, while many people refer to the NIST guidelines that say that RSA 2048-bit keys are acceptable until 2030, NSA&#x27;s Suite B doesn&#x27;t include RSA <i>at all</i> and only recommends ECC. The problem is that the state of the art in open source cryptography software and hardware has not caught up to NSA in the 10 years since Suite B was published.<p>If you really want to use your Yubikey, a reasonable compromise might be to generate a 4096-bit RSA <i>master key</i> (stored offline), and put 2048-bit <i>subkeys</i> on your Yubikey, which you would want to rotate periodically. This gives you the benefits of a strong key for establishing your identity in the Web of Trust and the better performance characteristics of 2048-bit keys on smartcards. The downside is a higher upfront setup cost, and periodic maintenance cost on both your part and on the part of the people you communicate with, since you will want to rotate your subkeys and they will need to refresh their copy of your key whenever you do that.<p>Given what we know from the Snowden documents, spy agencies seem to attack endpoint security often and don&#x27;t seem to be able to crack commonly used encryption schemes, including RSA (although they can almost certainly factor 1024-bit keys, given current estimates for the costs of such an operation). Therefore, the improved endpoint security afforded by using a GPG smartcard might make using a smaller key size a worthwhile tradeoff.<p>On the other hand, GPG does not provide forward secrecy, so while it&#x27;s important to rotate keys and delete old messages as much as possible as part of OPSEC for your local machine, if NSA is capturing your GPG messages from the wire for later decryption, you&#x27;d probably want to prefer using the strongest keys possible. This is an area where increased StartTLS deployment (especially with forward secure ciphersuites) can help.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s important to note that when you argue in favor of 4096-bit keys over 2048-bits keys, you are saying &quot;I believe my adversary can factor a 2048-bit RSA key, but not a 4096-bit RSA key&quot;. If your adversary can factor a 2048-bit RSA key, and they really want to read the email that&#x27;s been encrypted with your 4096-bit key, I would argue there are a lot of options available to them, such as:<p>1. MITM a software update for your mail client or operating system. It depends on the specifics of your system, but many systems today use 2048-bit (or weaker) keys for authenticating software updates.<p>2. MITM any website you visit (most CA&#x27;s have 2048-bit roots, so it doesn&#x27;t even matter if all the sites you visit have 4096-bit keys) and use a browser exploit to deliver some malware that exfiltrates your email when you decrypt it.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.yubico.com/2015/02/comparing-asymmetric-encryption-algorithms/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yubico.com/2015/02/comparing-asymmetric-encrypti...</a>",1429688806

Report back. Try also Logo, Dylan, Clojure, Newlisp and a bunch of other languages.<p>> What you&#x27;re saying is basically tantamount to a claim that CL has stayed truer to the syntax of McCarthy&#x27;s Lisp, but it would be easy to argue that Scheme is truer to the mathematical principles of McCarthy&#x27;s Lisp.<p>You can try to argue that, but it would be wrong. McCarthy&#x27;s Lisp uses Symbols, Functions and even EVAL quite different from Scheme. Scheme has done everything to remove EVAL. Look at various Scheme reports where EVAL is not even part of the language or defined as a &#x27;library&#x27; function.<p>> Looking at syntax is a very shallow way to look at it.<p>If we only need to provide a little bit of syntactic support to make Lisp 1.5 code run in Common Lisp. What does it say? Most of the other stuff is intact: 90% of the syntax and a lot of semantics, naming, APIs, core principles.<p>> The rest of your post is incoherent because you&#x27;ve used the isolated word &quot;Lisp&quot; despite the fact that this conversation is about the very fact that the meaning of &quot;Lisp&quot; is unclear.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s unclear for you. I told you what Lisp is: a group of languages who, evolve over time, share literature, community and code.<p>People wrote compatibility packages and translators to make porting across these languages easier.<p>Today it makes no sense to share software between Racket, Clojure and SBCL (a Common Lisp implementation). They are fully incompatible: semantics, names, architectures, tools, ... literally nothing is shared.<p>> Porting almost any CL program from CL to McCarthy&#x27;s Lisp would require dropping most features. Hopefully this highlights the problem with this whole debate.<p>Time moves mostly in one direction. People wrote math software in Lisp 1.5, ported it to Maclisp, then Lisp Machine Lisp, then to various Common Lisp variants.
Lisp code was written sometimes to work in older dialects too, but that support was usually dropped when the older implementation was no longer used. For example some people wrote software in Interlisp and ported it to Lisp Machine Lisp. Then Common Lisp. Then the Interlisp support was dropped.<p>The Computer Algebra system Macsyma for example has bits implemented in old Lisp implementations from the 60s. It was then ported to Maclisp, Franz Lisp, Lisp Machine Lisp, Common Lisp.<p>Each time the Lisp dialect was improved and extended. But many of the core principles remained. Some code ran in multiple Lisp dialects and was maintained in one file. The LOOP macro was for example inspired by Interlisp&#x27;s FOR, was then implemented in Maclisp and then ported to Lisp Machine Lisp, NIL and Common Lisp. For several years it was maintained in one master file. A really hairy piece of code with lots of macrology.",1429687999

Since the West believes that its superpower status is hollowing out - even if it were not true - it will act in correspondence with this belief: in this case with surveillance, etc.<p>I happen to agree with the West&#x27;s national security posture that their status is hollowing and that the AIIB and other institutions propose viable alternatives for large portions of the world and threaten the old order (though I&#x27;m no expert either).<p>The reason is that foreign investment is a way that countries can use to very strongly project power. Take the activity in the Baltics - the IMF packages to Kiev - to influence political and geostrategic outcomes which is often worth huge amounts of wealth in the long run. That is to say you aren&#x27;t always going to get money from the country you are lending to, but you will get influence on political outcomes. And we can see that with China&#x27;s plans in Eurasia and how these plans for example align with their veto votes on UN activity in the Middle East. Russia had tried to create a Eurasian Union, which has kind of staled but it&#x27;s likely that with a giant investment bank to fund infrastructure that it can be pulled off.<p>Long argument short - it&#x27;s not always about getting money back on your loan: it&#x27;s often about getting your pipeline, your highway, your port, or your defense garrison.",1429687910

Really, most crypto chips are at their core: they almost always just make them out of old ones with new bits glued on to (reasonably) try to reduce (high) NIST/etc certification costs. (Seriously, it&#x27;s still carting a hardware DES implementation around.)<p>I believe it has a 2048-bit multiplier with a particular (patented?) form of blinding to protect against side-channel attacks. That&#x27;s used for RSA; it can&#x27;t do 3072/4096 bit RSA keys without tricks as it stands unfortunately.<p>The existing NXP ECC implementation is also not in JCOP&#x27;s applets by default, I think? From what I saw, it (ab)uses the RSA multiplier. That can go up to 320 bit curves <i>in theory</i> without running out of scratch space, and is a generic implementation of prime fields over GF(p), so you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be able to do some operations on Curve25519 fine in principle.<p>And it can, but in my testing it did what I thought it&#x27;d do, and leaked side-channels when used with the NIST curves and djb&#x27;s curves, because the blinding on the RSA multiplier was simply not designed to cope with the regular structure of the special prime fields that most elliptic curves use. And the performance of random prime fields (like Brainpool) in software is awful, so no-one else wants to use those.<p>You&#x27;ve also got the problem that the existing implementation there can only do ECDSA (not the EdDSA used by Ed25519) and doesn&#x27;t have SHA-512 around, too.<p>A pure software implementation that avoids using the RSA multiplier would be much safer, and I think in principle would be able to do the other CFRG favourite, Ed448-Goldilocks, as well.

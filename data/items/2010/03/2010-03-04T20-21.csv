Perhaps it will, but I'm skeptical that any s-expr syntax will ever be palatable to a majority of programmers.<p>I think programmers tend to overestimate the importance of language choice in the success or failure of a development project. We can passionately debate the merits of static vs dynamic typing and various schools of syntax but I suspect that ultimately the skill and determination of the people involved make the crucial difference.<p>That said, I do think Clojure's prospects are better than any previous lisp, because even if it can't ""win"" it can tag along for the ride with the rest of the Java ecosystem and benefit from its much larger momentum.",1267736242

I think this happens pretty frequently, and always if the library's behavior deviates in a way that breaks the program.<p>In the context of Mac OS, I would prefer not to rely on the library makers, etc. to do the right thing in not changing interfaces, especially in the event that an earlier version didn't quite meet its spec. I'm OK with the earlier version not meeting spec, as long as the software maker accounted for that (which he did, if his software based on it is solid).<p>Also, I think consistency of behavior is more important in unix-style single-purpose apps than with monolithic Mac OS style apps, due to the former's higher likelihood in being used as part of a script or larger program.

Yes, intelligent people should have a good understanding of how big and complex the universe is and how little they know compared to the total amount of knowledge available. And given that they are aware of such, it wouldn't make sense for them to walk around claiming they are a big deal. However, people do not always act rationally, even geniuses. There is no negative-correlation between claiming to be smart and being smart, in spite of the obvious contradiction. Claiming to be smart and being cocky about it, it's just a personality trait. Think about this: you IQ is defined and practically unchangeable by the time you are a young teenager, but your personality continues to develop for many more years after that.

The longer you go without feedback or corrections, the less confident you can be that you're on the ""right track.""<p>That said, build systems and VCS aren't the only ways to optimize the process. For example, a system using scripts processed at runtime lets you reduce the amount of compiled code and iterate quickly on the one section by pressing a ""reload script"" button, or, even more conveniently, monitoring the source file and auto-reloading when changes are saved. If you're daring enough you could probably even do this with machine-compiled languages by abusing dynamic linking, though the ease of doing that would ultimately depend on the runtime linker capabilities.<p>Doing this kind of data-driven thing will cost runtime performance since less can be compiled and optimized statically, but if you treat it as the ""scaffolding"" work that it is and also include ways to reclaim some of the static factors for release builds, you can get a better overall result than you would if you were just suffering through long builds.",1267734132

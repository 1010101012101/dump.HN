That wasn't so hard now, was it?<p>There's also tools to automate the creation of debian control files for packages that don't already have them. It's really not that difficult as long as you aren't building particularly complex packages.<p>2. Author claims that SCM for local builds is hard. I'm not sure how pacman solves this - sure, you can auto-apply patches from the build script, but you still generally have to redo that sort of thing every time the original package updates. If you really want to keep your repository small, there's nothing wrong with just keeping the patches and debian directories in SCM and bashing together a script to check out a buildable copy for you.<p>3. Adding an extra package manager on top of an existing one can be a huge mistake.

582291,comment,581613,581613,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Stateful and REST can get along pretty well, depending on what's stateful. Your resources should be stateful; they don't disappear when the request is completed. Your client-side application should be stateful too; among other things, it keeps track of the user's linking from one representation to the next. The only thing that's stateless is the request... any given request should not depend on sending some other request first, except for the case where the first request changes the state of a resource, and the second request retrieves a representation of that resource.<p>I just designed a RESTful API, and it's built upon a very stateful backend. From the client's perspective, the only hint of statefulness is that the API sends Set-Cookie response headers, and expects to get Cookie request headers back. When they're sent, performance is much better. But to keep the requests stateless, the Cookie headers are optional. If they're not sent, the URL provides enough info to recreate the backend state. This is slower, but functionally equivalent, and I think it's an approach that qualifies as being fully and correctly RESTful, while still being essentially stateful internally.",1240874088

Namely, the independent study technique might naturally encourage this mode of learning by sheer accident. In short, you are studying to prepare for a discussion, rather than memorizing for an exam. This naturally causes you to 'close the book', recall, and then speak it out loud. (This article reports that speaking out loud is better than just recalling.)<p>In a conventional 'learn to test' scenario, one might feel naturally compelled to read and reread, or to take notes with the book open, simply out of desperation.<p>What do you think? Could the success of 'Unschooling' be largely due to the very effect described in the current article?",1240873752

582282,comment,581050,582189,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Perhaps more importantly, it wasn't actually grammar that I criticized.  It was erratic use of punctuation (which was clearly for effect and to catch attention rather than clarity), lack of appropriate capitalization (which negatively impacts readability, and definitely doesn't require extreme English skills to get right), aggressive tone (which I find annoying pretty much anytime I see it on the Internet, as it provides no value), and sounding like a self-righteous teenager (which <i>everybody</i> older than ~24 finds irritating).  Though one could argue that capitalization and punctuation are components of grammar, I used specific terms rather than a general one for a reason.  I tend to be quite forgiving of grammatical mistakes that can be attributed to native language differences and different levels of skill with English.  But, I'm less forgiving of things that are very easy to control and get right, even for non-native speakers, and that negatively impact my ability to read and understand.  When wrapped in negativity and an aggressive tone, I tend to feel negative towards the person.  So, I explained why his tone made me feel negative towards him, and why I thought people were voting him down.<p>I thought I was providing a helpful suggestion for how he could better present himself and his ideas on HN, but one can only do so much to be helpful.",1240873475

He states that China and India are not going to invest in expensive energy while they are catching up with the developing nations.<p>The question in my mind is can we drive the cost of solar and others down fast enough that we can ignore coal?  Or will our efforts to cut down carbon emissions be swamped by the developing nations?<p>Personally, I believe we should push hard on research.",1240873259

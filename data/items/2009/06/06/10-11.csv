644686,comment,644619,644628,0,0,shiro,,,"> the tax difference between the 2 boils down to how much you're going to make - that is if you make over $X per year you want one solution and if you make under $X you want the other.<p>I have an LLC, and some time ago I discussed about converting it to S-Corp with my accountant.   I forgot the details but the logic was like this:<p>In LLC, you pay 2.9% of your net income (wage + dividend) for SE Medicare tax, no matter how much you make.  In S-Corp, FICA tax, in which 2.9% Medicare is included, is only taxed on the wage portion.  Thus if your company makes a lot more than the standard wage, S-Corp saves the 2.9% on the dividend part of your income  (Wikipedia has example  calculation: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_corporation</a> ).   If your company just makes around or below the standard salary, you don't have this advantage of S-Corp, and it is a matter which one needs more paperwork and accountant fees; for one-man small LLC like mine, these overhead cost is smaller than S-Corp.<p>(Note: Social Security Tax has a cap, so it doesn't make difference if you set your wage above the cap.  You cannot set your wage too low in order to save FICA tax; it must be ""reasonable"").<p>Converting LLC to C/S-Corp looked a lot more work than converting S-Corp to C-Corp.  My accountant suggested me that the easiest way was to dissolve my LLC first then establish a new S-Corp.  Since my LLC was for small business and I didn't have any prospect of external funding, I decided to keep LLC.",1244285452

Success is the road, and failure is the car your driving.  It's the vehicle by which you move forward, it's those incremental steps.  No one ever goes in just one direction, failure is how you find your bearings.<p>Another good talk on obsession from HOPE 08: <a href=""http://fora.tv/2008/12/12/MythBusters_Co-Host_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fora.tv/2008/12/12/MythBusters_Co-Host_</a><p>Video of the water heater explosion: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu3FwgIHsQA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu3FwgIHsQA</a><p>Link to just the explosion (time offset): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu3FwgIHsQA#t=4m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu3FwgIHsQA#t=4m</a>",1244285078

It's tough to stay focused in the face of all that.<p>But it's a game of inches.  Every little bit of polish will get you a little closer to where you want to be.  Every one of those annoying edge case bugs you squash gains you another inch.  Sure, it doesn't seem like you're moving fast like you were a year ago (it certainly doesn't for me), but you're moving.<p>You have to.  Because if you stop you die.",1244283889

644674,comment,644601,644601,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Christianity is a very young religion (taking one example). I am certain it wont exist 100's of years in the future (mostly because certain elements wont stand the test of science). But will there be replacements? Religions born out of existing ones or created anew (a bad example: scientology). I imagine there will be.<p>At the end of the day religion is designed to fill a void: not the unexplained (because that, I think, is to do with faith and belief) but rather because humans constantly seek to hand off their reposnsibility. ""It's not my fault I ws told to..."". In a group like a religion blame can be spread out. I think society does need these organisations, for better or worse, to function (personally I wish it was different).<p>Will faith and belief in a higher power exist many hundreds of years in the future? Well I think there will always be those who refuse to believe the findings of science (Im thinking along the lines of young earth creationists). Many of those are due to religious brain washing - but some have actually developed that view through free will. And I dont see that changing. But I do think that faith and belief will focus on different aspects of the unexplained. I t just depends how far our science goes. In thousands of years we should have documented proof of darwin evolution for example. But will we have figured out the big bang? Who knows! :)<p>SO the simple answer to the question is, I think, yes religion does have a future and yes faith does have a future: but the form it takes is dependant on our scientific progression (a small irony there I feel)",1244283683
644673,comment,643207,643845,0,0,pygy,,,"The genre almost died at the end of the 90's, in part due to the lack of commercial success for Grim Fandango.<p>There were a few franchises that survived, like the Broken Sword and Runaway sagas, and a few more games by other studios. Then Telltale, founded by a few LucasArts drop-outs, started to bring some new life to the scene.<p>If you like the adventure games of the 90's, you can play some of them in ScummVM, or DOSBox.<p>Most of these adventure games were programed using custom languages and VMs. ScummVM reimplements a dozen of such engines,  for more than 60 games supported. It can also run some windows games like MI 3, or the first two Broken Sword games. Furthermore, they have been able to get some of the supported games to be released as freeware.<p>DOSBox, being an X86 emulator can run most if not all of the DOS games of the era. With some work, it is possible to get it to run Win95.<p>Both of these projects are FOSS and have (among others), a Mac OS X port.<p>You can buy some more ScummVM or DOSBox games at Good Old Games (GOG).<p>I've heard that some of the TellTale games are supported by WINE (hence Darwine and Crossover Mac), but I don't know which ones.<p><a href=""http://www.scummvm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scummvm.org</a><p><a href=""http://www.dosbox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dosbox.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.gog.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gog.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.telltalegames.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telltalegames.com</a>",1244283134

So is the best recent sci-fi series <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>. A main character of <i>Firefly</i> is a preacher.<p>Even in <i>Star Trek</i> the Vulcans spend an awful lot of time contemplating candles and wearing robes. They may not talk about it on-screen but the producers must have consciously chosen to use monastic/Catholic imagery.",1244283007

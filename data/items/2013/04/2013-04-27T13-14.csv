Impressive, makes me think even less of the big banks if one of them employed you, frankly.<p>I don't see anything clumsy about my reasoning. The Libor scandal, for instance, is pretty clear-cut. The rate was set by, simplifying greatly, polling the banks and averaging. There is evidence that some of the banks misrepresented their actual cost of borrowing in order to further their own interests, and thus skewed the rate improperly.<p>Is any of this in doubt? Now, it might not be the Illuminati secretly picking the president and ordering him to clone Hitler, but it sure does demonstrate that our market economy isn't quite as ""market-ish"" as we had hoped.<p>That's a big problem in my book because the fundamental argument in favor of markets as a means of organizing economic activity is that they generate socially optimal outcomes. Otherwise, there's no reason for most of us to buy into the system, it's just feudalism (which economists and capitalists take great pride in having vanquished) all over again and most of us are still just serfs. If those markets are being manipulated, then are the outcomes socially optimal? Or, more specifically, are they <i>more</i> socially optimal than some other method of organizing things? If not, then the whole system is called into question, and that's a huge deal.",1367071167

5617766,comment,5613301,5617593,2,0,fnordfnordfnord,,,"No, it's often much easier than that. I do live in a pretty quiet neighborhood, but that's not what I meant either. There are a couple of things. One is that people tend to be vigilant WRT their home's primary access, but pay less attention to side-doors, back-doors, garage-doors, and windows. So you can often find one of these left unsecured. The second is that the latches on windows are notoriously bad WRT their ability to stay closed. They can often be dislodged by just bumping them gently while applying pressure in the right place, even when installed correctly. If they were installed incorrectly, or just carelessly, or if the house has ""settled"" windows can be even easier to defeat. Another weakness of windows is the glazing, sometimes it just slips out, or can be easily pried loose, sometimes it takes a screwdriver. Until very recently, little attention seems to have been paid to the security of windows in residential construction. There are a few other more-foolproof entry methods that I know that do little or no damage, but they aren't the sort of thing that a burglar would do.<p>PS I learned most of this at Texas Fireman's Training Academy (and just paying attention to my surroundings), in case you're wondering.",1367071155

People use pride to motivate them. The pride of finishing a course, an assignment, a homework problem, getting a paycheck, promotion, a diploma -- I could go on. I can't even count the number of times I thought I was prepared for a test only to end up with a barely passing grade (if I was lucky). Practice and preparation are empty, unfulfilling activities without pride, and I think that's why I could never get anything out of them.<p>Pride is something that I struggle with even ten years after I packed all my shit into my car and made the long and painful drive home from university. My failures still hang heavy on my every movement, regardless of the good things that I do today. It could have been different, I think to myself. I should have done better.

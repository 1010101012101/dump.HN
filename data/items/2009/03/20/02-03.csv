524418,comment,523946,524231,0,0,chris11,,,"That is a good point. When addicts use drugs their stress is reduced. But nicotine is unique in that its profile depends on the dose.<p>When smokers want to have more concentration, they take short and quick puffs. This gets a low level of nicotine in the blood. At a low dose, nicotine increases norepinephrine and dopamine. So it acts like a stimulant.<p>When smokers want to relax, they take long and deep puffs. This increases the dose of nicotine. And at high doses, it affects serotonin and opiate levels in the brain and acts like a sedative.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Psychoactive_effects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Psychoactive_effects</a>",1237517046
524417,comment,524348,524362,0,0,HackerJoe,,,"R2 is not a pull-down resistor.<p>They are taking an analog reading here, and the resistor is used as part of a voltage divider. You can use Ohm's law to calculate the output voltage.<p>To understand why R2 is needed, imagine the circuit without it. It would always read 5V, no matter the temperature.<p>Pull-down (and up) resistors are used on digital components with floating outputs, like switches, buttons, etc. For example, if a button is either open or connecting to a high potential, you would use a pull-down resistor to give meaning to that open state.",1237517018
524416,comment,524348,524351,0,0,mindslight,,,"Look at it this way - a thermistor varies its resistance based on temperature. But an A/D port doesn't read resistance - it reads voltage. Therefore, you need some circuitry to translate the sensor resistance into a voltage. The simplest way of doing this is the ""voltage divider"" shown.",1237516908
524415,comment,524348,524362,0,0,robotrout,,,"That's actually not quite true.  In digital circuits, we do often use pull-ups or pull-downs to keep an input from floating.  That's not what's happening here.<p>You're making a voltage-divider.  One half of the voltage-divider  is your temperature sensing resistor (thermistor), and the other half is the resistor you're asking about.  Go look up voltage-dividers.  In the meantime, I made a little javascript helper app as one of my very first 'learn javascript' apps a while ago.  Check out <a href=""http://eebug.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eebug.com</a> to play with a voltage divider.  In the app, both legs of the voltage divider are constant resistors, while in this circuit, one leg's resistance varies with temperature, but it's the same concept.",1237516882

The former group are the ones setting the market value, since they're the ones who are going to monetize the exploits.<p>The idea of announcing NO MORE FREE BUGS really amounts to saying to the world ""I'm either going to sell my work to criminals, or am going to participate in an ongoing blackmail scheme to make myself rich.""<p>Nice.

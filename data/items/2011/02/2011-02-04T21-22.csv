The way I understand it, you pay off your smallest debt by whatever means necessary, make minimum payments on everything else.  Then you take what you were paying on that debt, and apply it to the next.  Over time you are eliminating debt and applying all the money you spent on the eliminated debt towards the next debt.  So you start paying off faster as you go.  At least that's how I think the plan works.",1296856704

* E-INK
* Optionally in color! (I like the blackboard aesthetic, to say nothing of green-on-black)
* Lightweight
* Long battery life
* Ability to read text files (on the dev roadmap, at least)
* Open-source firmware (in case the ability to read text files doesn't manifest itself quickly enough for my tastes, and for general hackability)
* Central place that I can keep all my notes and easily take them with me pretty much anywhere<p>Additional things that I probably need in order to have it be more than a fun toy:
* Responsiveness (as others have mentioned, too much lag between pen motion and stroke appearance is probably a deal-breaker, though if it only happens occasionally it's okay; my current tablet has the same problem and it's still usable for me)
* Better navigation (it seems pretty shoddy; I don't want to have to flip through a hundred pages to find a particular note... and once I do, how do I get back to the front page?)
* Hierarchical ability to group pages together (so I can keep my shopping lists in one place, my notes for classes in a different place--sets of pages grouped together by specific lecture, which are then grouped together by class--and my todo list in another place...)<p>Additional things that I want but don't need:
* Ability to use external keyboard to write to text files (this would be awesome, but I can also appreciate that it might go against their ethos)
* PDF and text file annotation
* Infinite paper with scroll and zoom (I'm less certain of this, though; seems like it would be great for mindmapping and stuff like that, but it also seems like it could be easy to lose things off in the middle of nowhere)
* Ability to rearrange text (rectangle/lasso select and then drag/cut/paste)
* Tactile sense of drawing on paper (This would be awesome, but my tablet works pretty well for me without it)",1296856505

I'm fine with them but with as much transparency as possible.<p>I'm not sure I follow. You want transparency for government revenue and for every person to be in tune with the cost of government. Do you think it is important for people to be in tune with the expenses of said government? You could easily make the claim that explicit transparency in terms of how much money is spent on $government_service would be beneficial (true cost of ""free"" roads, money spent on each military base, etc).

2181416,story,,,19,21,mistermann,"It seems my Chinese supplier has stolen $50,000...do I have any recourse?",,"Sorry for the rambling disorganized story....<p>I've been having some goods manufactured in China for several years now.  We have always worked through the same contact, let's call her ""Zoe"".  Zoe was recommended to us by a Chinese friend (let's call him Lee) of my business partner.  Whether it has been the same company performing the actual manufacturing this whole time I do not know.<p>We typically place orders consisting of 3 forty foot shipping containers at a time.  The typical terms of the agreement are that we pay for containers #1 & #2 up front, #1 is manufactured and sent to us, we pay for #3, and then #2 and #3 are sent to us.  The justification for this is that they had to purchase raw materials for the entire order in advance.  This seems reasonable to me.  Whether or not that is actually done I do not know.  It typically takes us about 18 months to work through 3 containers of inventory.  The cost to us for each container is approximately $50,000.<p>Each time we place the large order, there is a date set on when we will send the final payment.  Due to some complications in our business, we missed our agreed upon date for final payment by about 8 weeks.  A series of emails were exchanged between us and Zoe, us explaining the issues on our end, and her explaining a variety of reasons why we must send our final payment immediately (inflation in China, factory moving on to something else, etc etc).  Eventually, she gave us an ultimatum, a final date by which she must receive the final payment.  If we were to miss that date, our penalty would be forfeiture of our 2nd $50,000 payment.<p>By this time, we were getting a bit nervous.  The various stories given requiring our immediate payment were inconsistent.  In some emails she indicated the 2nd order was finished and ready for shipping, in others it was half complete (in emails after ones in which she indicated it was fully complete).  We have always been very easy going, and if our delay caused an even greater delay due to timing on their end, or additional costs due to inflation, we would have had no problem with that.<p>Basically, we were scared to put $100,000 at risk when she was acting so unusual, so we missed our final deadline, and now it looks like she is sticking to her guns, is going to keep our 2nd installment and that shipment, and has stopped responding to emails.  fwiw....the goods we have manufactured are extremely proprietary, and any she has in inventory are useless to her as she would be unable to find a buyer.<p>Throughout this whole time we haven't heard a peep from ""Lee"", the person who initially put using touch with ""Zoe"".  (He used to live here, but is now back living in China).  At the outset of this arrangement, he was actually quite a trusted contact of ours, but that seems to have changed.<p>So, in a nutshell:
1. We've paid for 2/3 of an order, and received only 1/3.
2. We missed a payment deadline by about 2 months, and as a result, she is keeping payment #2 as penalty. (There was nothing in our ""contract"" stating what would happen if either party reneged in part or in full on their end of the deal.)
3. We haven't heard from her for almost two weeks now.<p>So its starting to look pretty bad.  I'm wondering if anyone here has experience dealing with Chinese suppliers and could recommend a course of action for the situation I find myself in?  Do I have any legal recourse?  We do have several years of documented business transactions with Zoe, including payments from our side and shipped product from her side.<p>Any help or advice is appreciated.<p>PS: FWIW, she operates out of Futian District, Shenzhen City, Guandon Province. I have her email address, business address, bank account information (for wiring funds) and that is about it.",1296856316

Even based on a select loop the kernel has still been happy to do many things asynchronously for a long time now, it's just a bit of a klunky API.</i><p>I have the suspicion that we're in violent agreement.  One way to look at it is that select/epoll/kqueue/etc are hooks that allow the programmer to work around the kernel's threading model by doing several tasks at once in the same thread.<p><i>It's not even in the OS; the OS doesn't mind threadlets/green threads/OS processes, it's all in the high-level languages.</i><p>No, the OS does not mind these things.  On the other hand, User-Mode Linux proved years ago that the OS doesn't mind you implementing a whole other OS on top of it.  This is essentially what BEAM is:  though it outsources the ""interacting with hardware"" stuff to the underlying OS, it has all the other fundamental parts of an OS built-in.  One could argue that, given this, the OS does not actively fight you on anything.<p>In a perfect world, there would be no need to do this.  The process architecture would suit Erlang's purposes all by itself, and BEAM could be a regular old VM that outsources scheduling to the OS.  Unfortunately, this is not a perfect world, and real-world schedulers generally need to worry about a wide variety of things.  Not only that, but things like permissions are typically strapped onto scheduler primitives for historical reasons.  BEAM punts on many of those things, and thus trims a whole lot of overhead.<p><i>Missing things can be added, I'm talking about things where the underlying layers actively fight you.</i><p>On that basis, I can argue that C is perfectly happy to do all those same things.  BEAM is written in C, so anything BEAM can do is empirically possible in C.<p>When it comes down to it, the hardware doesn't know a thing about ""events"", ""processes"", ""threads"", ""semaphores"", or even ""concurrency"".  The hardware performs calculations, and it does not care whether those calculations are specified in ""The Operating System"" or ""A Userspace Program"" or ""A Library"".",1296854302

But, I think people (especially intelligent HN type people) greatly underestimate how much psychological tricks affect them. I know deep down that spending with credit card is the same as spending with cash. But, I tracked my spending using cards and only withdrawing from ATMs and using cash. I spent about 20% more. And my life didn't feel any better or anything. Now I use credit cards on the big stuff- like travel, transportation costs, and other large ticket items where credit versus cash is unlikely to affect me spending habits. Point is, you get some tiny cash back, but I think for 99% of people you spend more than you get.",1296853430

This, combined with relatively easy credit recently has resulted in the card companies marketing to people that they would previously had stayed away from.<p>We've learned that people often become accustomed to credit at an early point in their lives (college), rely on it for awhile, then don't suffer any explicit repercussions, and so grow accustomed to it until the problem grows and it's too late.<p>I don't really think it's a 'conspiracy' either, since it's clear what the motivations for all of the involved parties are.<p>Would love to chat about this more, but I need to tend to the serverz :)",1296853270

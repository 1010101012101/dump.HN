This ensures at least two people in the team knows about the changes, let us talk about the why and how of the changes, and possibly teach a coworker new things in the process.<p>What it ended up doing is that every programmer now self-reviews their own changes prior to the actual review knowing they&#x27;ll soon share it all face to face with a coworker.

9519452,comment,9518830,9518830,0,0,dalke,,,"The distribution maps are odd. My best interpretation is that the &quot;natural&quot; map shows the countries where a species can be found while &quot;artificial&quot; maps show those countries where a species is economically significant.<p>I say this because the modern maize map does not include Sweden, but maize is grown in Sweden. (See <a href=""http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-maize-zea-mays-crop-flowering-in-field-narke-svealand-sweden-august-61846170.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-maize-zea-mays-crop-floweri...</a> for a picture, see <a href=""http://småbruk.se/gronsaksodling/majsodling/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://småbruk.se/gronsaksodling/majsodling/</a> for a description (in Swedish) of a hobby gardener growing sweet corn in Sweden.)<p>Thus, the maps on the right-hand side should likely show a more extensive range for the domesticated variants.<p>You might believe that makes the argument even stronger. However, consider tigers. While neither domesticated nor native to many countries, tigers exist in and are reproduced in many countries. (<a href=""http://zooborns.typepad.com/zooborns/tiger/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zooborns.typepad.com/zooborns/tiger/</a> gives recent births in the US, UK, Germany, Denmark, and the Czech Republic.) A species distribution map using the similarly broad category would show that tigers are now wide-spread.<p>Thus, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude those maps were made more for their immediate propaganda effect than as something where it&#x27;s possible to draw useful inferences from the direct comparison of the two maps.<p>(There are of course other problems with the map. Removal of milkweed in order to raise maize and other crops has lead to a steep decline in the monarch butterfly population. However, these maps cannot be used to address these broader.)",1431251871

Part of that money will come from poor farmers and part of it will come from the budgets of aid organisations.  But it&#x27;s not a solution to malnutrition.  It is a solution to only a single aspect of malnutrition, leaving the children affected with unknown but probably sufficient amounts of Vit A but still probably inadaquate amounts of iron, iodine, and zinc which need to be supplemented.  Since you&#x27;re supplementing iron zinc and iodine, and others, why not also supplement with a known dose of vit A instead of allowing companies to target poor people in the developing world.

We don&#x27;t <i>need</i> any other hypothesis. Therefore, the principle of parsimony kicks in and other, more complicated, hypotheses are ruled out. Not absolutely, but fairly strongly, at least until we find things that our current hypothesis cannot explain, which hasn&#x27;t happened yet.",1431249455

9519373,comment,9518748,9519259,0,0,lazaroclapp,,,"Reducing the importance of education to status games seems to me as a pretty absurd notion, considering that how educated a population is has an important (if often hard to precisely measure) impact in the technological and social development of a civilization. Regardless of what it says about individuals, as a measure of the success of a nation, the amount of luxury cars it consumes indicates very little[1]; the reasoning skills and knowledge of their average citizen is a far more indicative of the capacity of a nation.<p>Now, you can argue that formal higher education is not the only way to instill that knowledge and skills, and also varies widely between education systems. That much is true. But the point is to get easy to measure <i>proxies</i> for what you are really trying to measure. Does the amount of people that go through public education predict the average level of knowledge and reasoning of that country&#x27;s citizenship better or worse than looking at the amount of things they produce and sell? (not a rhetorical question, both answers can be supported, and each leads you to either HDI or GDP as a &quot;better&quot; measure.)<p>[1] Well, very little compared to what GDP+GINI would tell you",1431248616

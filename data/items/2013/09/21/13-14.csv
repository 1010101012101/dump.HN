6422946,comment,6422616,6422868,2,0,jamestnz,,,"That&#x27;s a fair point. And just to clarify (since you mentioned &quot;instructions&quot;), my references to MC above were referring just to the colored circular non-buttons discussed in the OP, and not to the &quot;A quick primer&quot; and &quot;Need help with your first campaign?&quot; instructions (which I&#x27;m assuming are always there, and are unrelated to the non-buttons I guess it would be nice if users could dismiss these newbie instructions once they&#x27;ve become experienced with the site).<p>But if these large circular non-buttons are to remain a permanent fixture on the MC Dashboard (rather than just a temporary &quot;look, here are our new features&quot; exercise), I still wonder why I&#x27;d want it to jiggle the blue pointer as if to say &quot;Oh there&#x27;s the place you SHOULD have clicked just now&quot;, when it could actually just take me to my obviously-desired destination immediately. That destination page would then become active on the navbar, presumably with some kind of visual indication that it is now the active one (&quot;presumably&quot; because I&#x27;m just speaking extemporaneously here, I haven&#x27;t used MC in ages)... so the attentive user will have learned a second way to reach their desired feature (as in, &quot;I clicked the big round button and it took me straight to the place I was expecting, and the &#x27;Lists&#x27; item on the navbar has become active&quot;).<p>Then you&#x27;ve provided two different ways to get to the desired feature in a single click (each method reasonable in and of itself), rather than providing one direct method (the navbar), plus an indirect method that attempts to retrain the user to click somewhere else instead.",1379771986

Since jade-inheritance does not offer compilation, this must be done using other tools which may use a different version of Jade.<p>Why not use the jade that&#x27;s already installed by the parent app? Due to the way dependencies work in npm, by just removing the jade dependency from jade-inheritance it should just traverse up the directory structure until it finds a jade package. Just instruct users to install jade alongside with jade-inheritance, and instead of using node_modules/jade-inheritance/node_modules/jade, it should use node_modules/jade.",1379771560

Correlating proxy records with modern instrument records of temperature is not trivial either (which becomes far more apparent once you look at more than a single proxy record).<p>It&#x27;s just cherry picked data to make a cheap political point. The scale of the vertical axis makes it very hard to see what is happening during interglacials, which is what we are in at the moment. If we were worried about an ice age arriving in the next couple of centuries the choice of scale might have some merit, to show how much colder it could possibly get.

Updates to those works will affect this one; the hope is that those 73 underlying datasets aren&#x27;t systematically biased and any errors will cancel out.  Another is that those error bars are probably 95% confidence.  So we fully expect that about 550 out of the 11,000 years in this chart will fall outside of that range.  A final bit is that we&#x27;re only reconstructing averages here; it&#x27;s a lot easier to guess the average number of shoes owned by 1000 people than the exact number of shoes owned by 1.<p>These extra caveats don&#x27;t invalidate the data or render it useless, they just qualify it.

Putting actual instructional labels onto interface elements, whether in software (e.g. using words &quot;Click here to...&quot; in the text of a hyperlink) or in real life with the push/pull signs, is oftentimes a cop-out in lieu of a more thoughtful/obvious design.<p>In computer software interfaces (particularly web apps), I would suggest that a large, prominent, colored circle with a gloss effect and an action written/iconized on it, has the affordance of carrying out that action immediately when clicked (for some value of &quot;immediately&quot;) -- i.e. being a button.<p>If substantial UI changes have taken place within an app that already has a customer base, I agree it may be valuable to bring these to the attention of the users. But a highlighted notification box appearing at the top of the app&#x27;s regular UI screens, which persists until the user reads and dismisses it, is widely used -- rather than sprinkling &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; signs around a wrongly-conceived interface[2].<p>Even the venerable &quot;tool-tip&quot; (aka HTML &quot;title&quot; attribute) seems often overused, becoming a crutch to support a mystery-meat navigation[3] philosophy which requires users to hover and wait to figure out what the hell _anything_ does.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance</a><p>[2] I&#x27;m not suggesting that the MC UI itself is wrongly-conceived or even particularly bad, just continuing with my general point.<p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_meat_navigation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_meat_navigation</a><p>[n] The examples about cockpit design and push/pull doors come from actual published studies in ergonomics.

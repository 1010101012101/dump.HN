We're both students ourselves, but are a bit older and have more working experience than the average attendee will probably have.<p>Here are some of the ideas we've had so far:<p>- Present on ""using and knowing the tools"" from OS to editor to libraries.<p>- Something interactive, like working as a group through one of the problems from the New Turing Omnibus.<p>- Talk about the social aspects of coding, like group dynamic and collaboration tools, and maybe introduce pair programming.<p>The audience will be mostly undergraduate CS students.  My friend and I are 25, and have worked freelance and at startups/medium sized companies on mostly Rails, PHP, and Java web apps for 5+ years.  We have a lot to learn ourselves, and see this speaking opportunity as a way to better ourselves as presenters and learn more about the topic we pick.<p>So, what's a good topic?

966980,comment,966876,966876,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"First off I'd change the name. It makes no sense, and is hard to pronounce at a glance. Getting people back to your app is step #1 in both engagement and virality, and your name is harmful there. You seem to be about sharing stuff with family (which is inherently viral) so make your name reflect that. You chose some stock photography designed to play in Middle America, make your URL match.<p>The nice thing with this type of product is that people upload photos and videos of family members mainly to share with other family members, so right there you have inherently viral behavior. Your job now is to make it as frictionless as possible.<p>Add in those viral channels. Make it easy to share via Facebook or email. I can't sign up for the product to see what you have enabled, but you should have Facebook Connect at the very least. I'd use Google Friend Connect, Yahoo's equivalent, and MSN's as well to make it easy to import contacts and email them a photo or link to a group of photos with one click.<p>Do you have embeds? Can people embed a family video on their blog trivially from your site? Can they share it via Twitter with a click?<p>Just spend some time figuring out how your users want to share these things (this is one of those rare instances where simply asking them will return high value info) and make that easy as pie.<p>So there's your traffic. Freemium seems to be almost a necessity here. I really can't think of an alternative monetization model that makes sense.<p>Premium-only is death to viral spread. If you decide to go that route, I'd assume you'll have to purchase traffic via AdSense and the like. Get some metrics in place early so you can calculate CPA and RPU. Test with a few thousand bucks worth of ads. If your RPU turns out to be a large multiple of CPA you're set. Just know that with premium only you're aiming for relatively low traffic and relatively high RPU. Not a bad way to go for the right product, but you need to be insanely metrics-driven to make that work.",1259535149

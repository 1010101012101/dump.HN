Why hire like mad unless you expect to blow up soon? However, I'm not really willing to be a full-time investor at the moment. Index funds and a high-yield savings account do a good enough job of keeping up with the market for very little intellectual investment.<p>Regarding high-risk, high-yield investing, the Kelly criterion comes to mind. It says that given some bias in the outcome of some bet, and a return proportional to the expected result (without the bias), there's an optimal portion of your principal to wager in each round to get the best yield over time. And it's surprisingly low -- in the case of a coin toss rigged 51% in favor of heads, for example, you should only bet 2% of your principal.

Its not clear to me why I would visit your site versus Hacker News since the community here culls out the startup related posts from the sources you have listed on your site already.<p>Also, ""startups"" is a pretty broad topic and there are lots of sites which aggregate startup related content.  It seems like you could be more successful by picking some aspect of startups and focusing on aggregating content related to that specific aspect.<p>As far as video, vator.tv has lots of startup video content.  I am not sure about pictures, but sites like slideshare.com have interesting startup related presentations.",1228774359

There are many site builders out there, so I think execution counts for a lot.<p>Two quick suggestions:<p>1) Get a demo video up on the homepage. Show a person what they can do.<p>2) Get a demo video up after a person has signed up. If my dad were using this, he could walk through the wizard up to the point where he arrives at his site.

They ported the entire WebObjects stack from ObjC to Java, only to watch the technology get abandoned by those in the banking and eCommerce communities.  The conversion was so total that when the Cocoa-To-Java bridge in OS X was deprecated, it was no longer possible to continue using the original WO tool chain.

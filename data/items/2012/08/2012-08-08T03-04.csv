Anyways, I've made a decent living so far going this route. But there have been some ups and downs. So now I'm thinking I want to go the route of a salaried job and have been kind of exploring the job market in the area. I'm 30 y/o now, am married, and have 2 kids (7 and 9).  And, am starting to value the idea of financial stability afforded by a salaried position. So I'm seriously ready to take the plunge.<p>I have an Associates in IT with a local community college affiliated w/ the University of KY and ~11 years of professional experience doing web design/ development as well as complex data intensive web applications/services and windows software for various .gov/.mil, state and city. As you can imagine, most of the web design projects were smaller and done solo while the larger projects I was part of a team.<p>Aside from the standard HTML/CSS/Javascript combined with a bit of Photoshop skill. I do a lot of development in ASP.NET/C# w/ SQL Server or Oracle database  on the backside. A lot of Entity Framework and bit of Silverlight too. I consider myself a pretty decent programmer these days. I'm really looking for advice on how best to craft my resume. Besides the .docx I threw up http:/michaelkelley.me and a little more adventurous http://michaelkelley.me/resume<p>Advice on honing my resume and presentation for landing a decent job in the ~60-75K/year w/ benefits and whether I should bother with any kind of website resume<p>SO yeah... this turned into a pretty long-winded AskHN but please any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm still churning around some ideas for a great startup and I plan on saving some money up through this job to work towards that goal! Hopefully I can turn this process into a nice blog post after I land a position and let everyone know how it went.",1344398173

I'm I'm the epitome of a Wikipedia outsider and I agree with your parent that this is not good design.<p>It's pretty and minimalist and trendy but it isn't Wikipedia. Honestly, they would have done the same thing with any website. It's just a shallow coating of gloss over what they've labelled as ""bad design"". There is a lot wrong with this whether you're an insider or outsider. These are my biggest peeves:<p>Not only do they throw up a huge middle finger to non-English speakers (something I usually don't ever mind but this is almost obscene) but they do it in a way which involves replacing the current system with mystery meat navigation. How is anyone supposed to know the color bar is clickable and not just a ripoff of Vimeo?<p>The logo... They explain why the current logo is what it is then proceed to basically say ""but we don't give a shit, let's use cool fonts and be trendy"". The whole concept of the world being a puzzle of knowledge goes right out the window and they carried absolutely no piece of it into the new one. Also, the ""w"" brands have one major flaw: Wictionary. Every other name is a compound word but Wiktionary isn't a compound word but kind of a half compound word. It sticks out and doesn't make sense like the others (had the others truly made sense to begin with). I know it's a minor detail affecting only one brand but good design is all about the details.<p>In the end this redesign amounts to nothing but slapping a fresh coat of trendy on a massively popular website. It smacks of arrogance and self importance. I have to say they damn sure know how to make something look pretty and trendy but the way they went about this, especially the subject they chose, made them look pretty terrible now.",1344397847

Your vision of ""nerd"" seems to be nothing but ""young white guys who don't work out much"": who thinks of themselves that way?  It is possible to be a fashion nerd, approaching the topic from a scientific, data-driven, rules-based or technology-incorporating point of view.  An article about the history of pants got a bunch of upvotes a while back.  MIT has clothes that strip pollution out of the air.  That's nerdy fashion.<p>When talking to nerds, I wouldn't don't assume the audience will be sold by being told that there is something wrong with them that you can fix.  Instead, be passionate and apply a nerdy lens to whatever that topic might be.  Most of us are perfectly capable of doing the research to look good, and most of us don't bother.

There also won't be a huge savings on corporate office space in places like downtown Las Vegas or even downtown Reno.<p>Companies starting in Nevada will get a bit of a benefit due to the looser requirements on employee benefits and companies can get away with offering crappier benefits due to a lack of job availability in the area. The flip side of that coin is that there isn't a ton of top notch talent in the area. The top notch talent is making a salary on par with SV or at most 10-15% less. Top talent is constantly leaving the area for SV rather than moving to the area. Most of the companies that I know are actively recruiting recruit out of Oregon and the midwest.

This shit is writing up and you are going to be in paperwork on this for the next six months.  I'll call my lawyer, you call your union rep 'cause he'll be working this for a while.""

However a lot of state laws say ""You will build your building according to Document X by Corporation Y"" and that <i>is</i> copyrighted and not given out without a lot of money.  The reason why these exist is that lawmakers aren't experts in, say, concrete; and those who are tend to be employed privately, and make industrial standards.  As an example consider specifying that a program will be written in C (a bad idea here, but saying ""structural members for buildings shall be steel as defined by this standard"" isn't a terrible idea).  C is defined by the relevant ANSI or ISO standard; now if you want to know what the law actually says, you have to pony up the money for an official standard.<p>I don't know what settled law is about this, but it is at the least morally questionable activity.",1344397153

The people that bought into the FB IPO did so out of their own free will. That they believed the valuations is down to the hype surrounding the FBIPO and the hard work of the underwriters to convince investors of the strength of their case.
There are 2 types of investors, informed and uninformed.
These were uninformed investors. They operate under the principle that they can exceed the average market return (i.e. they don't understand the efficient markets hypothesis).<p>The market doesn't make these mistakes, the investors do. The market is the mechanism by which mistakes in valuation are discovered, as the IPO trends towards its fair value.<p>The fact that these are bad for the credibility of the market does not deter wall street for looking out for more sources of revenue (in the form of underwriting IPOs). It may make companies thinking of raising cash on the market think again - ('Is our valuation correct? How can we avoid being overhyped?') but in the long run this is nothing different to what has happened in hundreds of IPOs in hundreds of stock markets in hundreds of companies over the past several hundred years.",1344397062

4049394,comment,4047725,4048929,1,0,irahul,,,"I think you are arguing against a claim I didn't make. Your first half of the post about compiler classes and other tougher courses are giving me the perception that I somewhere claimed CS education isn't useful. I didn't make that claim. I was responding to the claim about CS and non-CS people taking different approaches to problem solving.<p>> But back to your comment: It's not that all code needs to be ""clever.""<p>By clever, I meant code that isn't routine. My definition of clever will include dynamic programming, reducing NP complete problems to known algorithms, writing a parser which takes xml as input and produces python dicts(""writing a parser is simple"" you say. But compared to the rest of the code in a typical project, it does count as clever)<p>> But sometimes the straightforward approach made by someone who is good, but self-taught, isn't as good as the equally straightforward approach by the self-taught AND CS-educated programmer.<p>It's not me who was making general claims. In my post, I did point out that about 20% of the time, CS background is very useful. The OP made the claim that CS and non-CS approach differs in general, which I don't think holds true.<p>> Real higher-level CS projects frequently involve interesting graphics research, which (also frequently) ends up working its way into commercial game development.<p>""Real higher level CS"" -> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman</a><p>You don't get to choose what real CS research is.<p>CS researchers have a lot of commendable qualities, but that requires a different set of qualities than a regular software development project, and CS research doesn't hone their skills as far as regular software dev is concerned.<p>Look at the code from the academia. More often than not, either there is no code(hence the comment ""doesn't exist"") or it's spaghetti. I don't see how that helps you write code for the regular projects where you work with teams, code isn't thrown away and you are expected to maintain it. Now, I am not saying CS researchers can't work that way - I am saying what they do for research doesn't help.",1338487190

What I'd like to do is put a pizza in the oven in the morning.  Then, the oven starts itself in the evening so that, when I get home, my pizza is already waiting for me.

Maybe I should demand a raise or look elsewhere for work if they don't appreciate me like Bob's employer appreciates him""<p>We today are also far more aware of when friends and colleagues change jobs so people perceive that changing jobs is a frequent occurrence and therefore change jobs more often, which then furthers the perception of job changing frequency in others.

4049332,comment,4048922,4048922,11,0,tokenadult,,,"The interesting article kindly submitted here builds its argument on this observation: ""Yet Facebook is still the world's largest social media site with more than 900 million users. And most importantly: Many of those people still visit the site each and every day, regardless of grumbling from cynics or short-term price fluctuations."" The structure of the article's rationale for being bullish on Facebook is all keyed to this. So I read the article carefully to see if there would be any mention at all of AOL, the previous company about which comparable claims were made. In the living memory of many people who used and have now left AOL (like me), the author doesn't even bring up AOL as an example. I'm sure that committed, loyal users who see their friends every day on an online network can nonetheless choose to leave that network--I've seen it done.<p>I agree with the author that Facebook's imposition of a ""house style"" on user profile pages was a huge advantage of Facebook over MySpace. That spared Facebook from being butt-ugly on most pages, and probably also reduces server load at scale. That Facebook is international is also a strength of Facebook--I have Facebook friends in several other countries, and I interact with them now more than I ever have before since we went off to separate countries. But to this day China is blocking Facebook, and other countries still have the technical means to restrict use of Facebook.<p>But user count isn't the key issue for a business. Revenue and eventually earnings (profits) are the key issues. All of my interactions on Facebook don't monetize Facebook. Facebook is under governmental supervision both in the United States and in the EU about how it uses user-supplied data to monetize. I read Facebook pages with AdBlock and F. B. Purity installed--I find Facebook disgusting when I view it on other computers. I can't think of any way that Facebook can monetize my share of the load on its servers without turning me off, and many of my friends think the same way. We are happy to free-ride on the gullibility of Facebook's investors (what consumer doesn't like a good deal?) but if Facebook seriously figures out how to monetize its full user base in a way that provides positive return on investment for Facebook's investors, that is likely to be through corporate behavior that turns off Facebook's users and drives them away. It's been done before, and I expect it will happen again.",1338486532

The road points toward the replicator, but it hits a dead end long before you get there.  You still run into a basic materials problem.<p>For instance, you mention 3D printing up a refrigerator.  You'll still need some sort of compressor gas for the actual cooling sections.  You're also not going to be able to print the permanent magnets for your compressor motor.  The 3D printer will help you make the doors and shelves, but the parts that actually make the refrigerator worthwhile have material properties that you can't simply print out.<p>You also mention clothes.  Now, this is a possibility, if you're willing to clothe people in plastic shirts and pants.  Effective, but highly uncomfortable and they're going to get pretty sweaty, especially in the developing countries where you want to do this.  Now, if we want cloth clothes, things suddenly become much more difficult.  First, the printer will still need plain fabric for input.  Thus, all the machine is saving us is the cost of dying, cutting, and sewing the fabric.  Considering that the jobs of cutting and sewing fabric have been shipped out to developing nations precisely because they have so much cheap expertise in those areas, it's not likely that a 3D printer is going to change much there.  To put it differently, how would access to a 3D printer change things that their current access to a sewing machine hasn't?<p>Don't get me wrong.  I love 3D printing and can't wait to own my own.  There's a lot of neat stuff that can be done with these.  However, it will ultimately be a joint approach.  Third world amputees won't be printing off prosthetic limbs.  They'll be printing off adapter cups that connect to a mass manufactured limbs.  There's just too much material science for most things to just be printed.",1338485980

I've never felt any adverse effects of the type in discussion (quite the contrary, amazing euphoria and well-being on some occasions).  But we shouldn't pretend that lucid dreaming is likely to be stimulating only and exactly the same brain regions as more typical dreaming (in terms of the metabolic and other activity levels).  Learning to activate the relevant memory writing modules while in dreams so as to increase dream recall is, after all, one of the typical first steps to developing LDs.  That mental machinery is seemingly not typically on to such a degree when dreaming as most people normally do.<p>That alone shows that some brain activity needs to be online that isn't in typical dreaming, and I imagine the various other bits of learned mental behavior to the LDing skill-set also change activation levels in brain regions.  Learning to exert the kind of attention/expectation control to stabilize and alter dreams is another sub-skill that often takes practice and so probably involves bringing online brain resources that might otherwise be off/recharging.<p>So if some people have lower neurochemical reserves of some type or other, this extra activity, use of such neurochemicals, at night (when their reserves would otherwise be replenished) could push them under some threshold of good functioning for a while.  My guess is that such sensitivities would be the rare minority cases, but this field is quite understudied to have grounded empirical beliefs on the matter.",1338485739

Most people going into computer science want to learn programming.<p>3. Many people get fed up with the rigors of <i>computer science</i> (because they recognize it isn't teaching them programming) and move on to other pastures instead.<p>I've always believed that there should be a ""Software Engineering"" curriculum in the engineering department and a ""Computer Science"" curriculum in the math department. That we blur the lines hurts both fields, as programming students demand more programming in CS, at the expense of the underlying theory; and math students demand more theory, at the expense of being able to actually code up a solution.<p>At the end of it all, though, there is a strong value for <i>some</i> computer science in all programmers. It is amazing how often solutions get re-invented, though it happens far less now with the combination of open source and Google.",1338485344

It bothered him that the non-Bachness of his singing has to be recorded along with what Bach wrote.)<p>It's not that I avoid Gould (or suggest anyone else does)in fact I've got his entire Bach catalog and love it (Beethoven and Sibelius, not so much)but one of the immense pleasures of listening to Bach in any form, and particularly in Gould's performances, is that one can listen to the whole of a piece <i>and</i> follow the voices individually <i>at the same time</i>. (Or, I guess, you can sort of Necker between the two if you can't quite hit the enlightenment listning.) That was where Gould blew the ""reference"" Landowska out of the water in '55 (she played a much more ""chorded"" performance). Listened to at low volumes, I can still do that with Gould's later recordings, but if the piece is played loudly enough to make the piano's voicing and dynamics distinctive, then the voice-over clouds the texture. I'd just love to hear it as Gould imagined it rather than as it was captured, not as a replacement necessarily, but as a companion.",1338485325

Python's introspection, first-class functions, magic methods, and duck-typing add a lot of the dynamism of Lisp, but every time you run up against something that needs to be a macro, it's a dead end. C has a rudimentary macro system that can get you a little past that point; for example, it's not too difficult to add a foreach construct to C that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    queue *q = queue_new();
    queue_add(q, 1);

    foreach (int i, q) {

Nobody has made a ton of money on last minute local deals yet, and this reeks of desperation and divided focus when they haven't been able to nail down their core business yet.<p>I just glanced on NYC GWU. In NYC they're averaging less than 1 public meal per day. NOT A GOOD SIGN. Other comments here indicate that Washington DC is also a flop.<p>Let's play the ""how much is GWU worth"" game.
They're not doing very much in NYC, which I would consider to be the top (or at worst 2nd place) candidate for GWU proving success.<p>Lets be generous and give them 1 meal a day in all of their 50 cities (more than NYC).<p>To be generous, say they get 10 diners per meal and munch on a 25% referral fee:<p>$30 meal x 10 diners x 25% == $75<p>(I just went through a few listings and typically I see far fewer than 10 diners (I saw zero listings with >9 diners))<p>GENEROUS SCENARIO:
50 cities * 1 meal/day/city * $75/meal * 365 days/year == $1.368M/yr in gross revenue.<p>realistically, its probably more like:
20 cities * 0.7 meal/day/city * $60/meal * 365days/yr == 306.6k/yr gross revenue.<p>What do we think grubwithus's operating costs are? well. employee costs alone are 1.4M/yr.<p>So gross revenues less employee costs and no other expenses,  no additional employee growth, gets them, in a VERY generous sales scenario, almost breaking even.<p>If they couldn't figure out in 1.6M how to scale one city, what gets an investor excited about this?<p>I don't see how it's their current business model.<p>Granted, I'm leaving out their soon to be launched happy hours and last minute dinners. The last minute GWU smells like local group deals to me. Groupon can't do it with their scale and only needing ONE buyer, much less an entire table to warrant the grub with us dinner (they have a tipping point before the dinner is ""on"").<p>Also, they used to have a model that penalized late joiners (or rewarded early joiners) with price differences, and back of the envelope calculations could show that being worth up O($50) / dinner, but that still doesn't make this a typical venture scale business.<p>Assuming the people who invested 5mm have less than 100% of the company... say its 25%, that's a 20M valuation on it, which in this internet bubble, doesn't sound terribly high.<p>I struggle to see the scenario where they turn this into a business where strict discounted cashflows will make this worth anywhere near 20M (i guess at zero rates, they just have to make the money <i>EVENTUALLY</i>).<p>So for investors to win on this deal, GWU basically need to get acquired. Investors buy in at a 20M valuation not to flip it at 25M.<p>The only possible acquirers are yelp or groupon type companies that are trying to drive online users to real world commerce. Restaurant syndicates have no interest. at anything less than a 40M sale this is a HUGE failure for investors, and at that price, its probably still a failure for employees, and possibly even the founders.<p>What are the odds that given the business model and assumptions of profits, this will ever be worth anything in that range to an acquirer?<p>I must be missing the point here, because i actually think investors are really smart, despite the fact the media coverage about startup frothiness focuses on some seemingly dumb decisions. These guys don't WANT to lose money...<p>I must have the entire picture wrong for GWU. Please help me see where I'm wrong.",1338484682

At one point I ""woke up"" from a lucid dream to find myself in bed in the middle of the night, went back to sleep, and then was awoken moments later by my alarm and found that the sun was fully risen. Not conclusive, as I may have just slept dreamlessly in the interim (although that's uncommon after waking from a dream and going back to sleep), but suspicious.<p>Another time, I woke up immediately after realizing I was dreaming, looked around my room, and found that my dream had persisted and was visually composited over the real world around me. This was, of course, extremely disconcerting, and my solution was to close my eyes and go back to sleep. But looking back, it seems far more likely that I dreamt that entire experience, including the waking up and looking around, than that my brain actually had that kind of catastrophic system failure.<p>In any case, losing your grasp on lucid dreams is a common and frustrating problem, and people have gathered a few tricks for holding on. One that has sometimes worked for me is, when I feel things beginning to slip, rather than panicking, to spin gently in place with my eyes closed (although closing your eyes in a dream is not always",1338484657

In that case, since value is always paired with a unit and both are variable, I totally agree.  Encapsulate.  Two related values that cannot meaningfully be separated should be treated as a single object.<p>But I've never seen a system like that for something like carb counting - it's always normalized, and everything is displayed in a single unit at a time, maybe changeable by user preference.  Maybe the problem is that so far nobody has built such a system.  Maybe it's that doing so means more complex SQL queries and larger indexes, because you need to consider two fields instead of one when summing / averaging / etc.  Maybe it's because users don't want it.<p>The argument for ints in this case is also an argument that you should only show a single unit at a time.

4049031,comment,4047370,4047753,5,0,dsrguru,,,"LaBerge proved that people can have lucid dreams at will as part of his doctoral research at Stanford.  Even if you haven't mastered the at-will inductions like MILD or WILD (see <i>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</i> by LaBerge or consult Google), you can increase your frequency of lucid dreams (once or twice a week for me in my third year of high school) by using critical state testing, which practitioners of Tibetan dream yoga have supposedly been doing for hundreds of years.  The idea is twofold.<p>First, it's usually very easy to tell if you're dreaming.  If you're sober and you even have to think about whether you're dreaming then you can safely say you are.  That's hard for some people to do, so you might want to use a more tangible method.  If you pinch your nose and try to breathe through it, you will be able to breathe in <i>almost</i> all dreams (you can never 100% prove awakeness, but we only care about proving asleepness), and you will never be able to breathe if you're awake.  So if you find you can breathe through a pinched nose, you know you're dreaming.  If you don't want to pinch your nose in public all the time, you could look at your hand instead.  Count the number of fingers and ask yourself if they are straight or deformed.  The dreaming mind is really bad about accurately generating five-fingered realistic hands, but we never notice unless we deliberately look at our hands in a dream.  This method is almost as surefire as the nose method.<p>The second part of the method is that if you make it a habit to check to see if you're dreaming whenever a certain kind of event comes up, let's say whenever you walk through a doorway, that behavior will carry over to your dreams once it has become a habit.  Once you walk through a doorway in your dream, you will do the nose or hand test and discover that you're dreaming.  It's fine to be skeptical of science when it sounds too good to be true, but seriously give it a try.  Lucid dreaming is a lot of fun, and there are also a lot of practical benefits.  One that comes to mind is being able to literally work out problems in your sleep.  It's sometimes hard to keep text constant on a dream whiteboard, but you have the advantage of being able to manipulate text with the snap of your fingers--something that you can't even do yet with vim or emacs.  Another advantage of lucid dreaming is nutrition and weight loss.  It's a lot easier to say no to that piece of cake now if you'll have the opportunity to eat it while you sleep.  Dream food tastes about the same as real food.<p>P.S.  The experience of astral projection (in the sense of having a highly real-feeling dream in which you can roll out of your physical body and walk around your room, which looks virtually identical to how it does in real life) is actually a real phenomenon that's rather easy to induce using a variation of wake-initiated lucid dreaming (WILD).  The vast majority of people who claim to achieve this are telling the truth.  While there is no reason to accept the non-scientific explanation that they're actually leaving their body in some astral plane in real life, the actual experience they're reporting is very real.",1338483739

""copyright"" (the right to commercially exploit these works) is merely a part of it.<p>Under this model, it makes sense to protect works for life time + X years.

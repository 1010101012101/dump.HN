For instance, if a firms one department has a law violator, law enforcers makes a case against the violators in obscurity and proceed to handle violators trying to be as low damaging as possible. They won't block any roadblocks that leads to every building or holding to that firm and try to exclude any not related property or individual. But the things are different on the Internet. It's ridiculous. The law enforcers treat online entities like there is no business going around and every business is crime oriented. So they just go forth and block every way of execution of the entity.<p>We must stand against this.<p>Also this is an ongoing trend over the world. And seems like it won't end any time soon.<p>Governments are revolting against the Internet.

I am going to go out on a very short limb here and say the web developer was on the few people advocating against blocking tablet users from using the normal website, since they actually understand how the web works.<p>In fact, when presented with the mandate that they needed a mobile app, the web developer probably just wanted to create a nice HTML5 site that could be served up in any tablet or mobile browser without the need to install a special app for their particular device. Know why? Because that is what web developers do.",1329376894

  moderately complex apps. You're presented with several options:

  1. Write controller code in views
  2. Write controller code in models
  3. Write controller code in a router
  4. Write your own controller infrastructure

  If you care about separation of concerns, none of these options are really 
  acceptable.
</code></pre>
I care about separation of concerns when it's limiting the program complexity, and I don't have any problem with 3.  Routing code is very lightweight, and it's sometimes beneficial to associate it with controller code -- those concerns are closely related, and not often referred to separately.  In backbone, it's very easy to split a router into many (controller-style) files.  If others have experiences to the contrary, I'd be interested to hear them.",1329376685

We are by far the dominant supplier in our field.  We are making a web app that allows our customers to control, operate, and mange our products.  It's garbage.  Let alone the fact that it's written in Java using seam convos, there was just no thought whatsoever put into UX.  For instance, if you press the back button, it takes you to the previous page.  So far, so good. However, if you try to perform some (any) action after that, you get a Java stack track and, weirdly, a ""your session has timed out"" error.<p>I brought this to our development lead, and his official, written response was, ""lots of web apps break if you use the back button.  If you use the back button during a ticketmaster checkout, you get an error.  This isn't a problem.""<p>Again, our hardware is fantastic and we have well over 50% market share in a massive industry.

777198,comment,776296,776296,0,0,pmjordan,,,"The ""Velcro"" bug seems uncannily familiar. We had extremely similar issues on a game I worked on. Our lead programmer was going down the ""dirty hacks"" route, which worked in some cases but in others was producing new bugs. In one instance, I think it was a hovership colliding with a tower, there was a back-and-forth between him and QA for about a week, where he'd patch against a specific symptom, and QA would (literally) find a new angle of attack where it would break yet again. The deadline was looming, so one day, he came up to me and asked, ""you studied physics at university, right? Can you have a look at this?"" So I did. It took me a weekend, but I eventually tracked it down to a horrendously broken box-to-capsule collision detection and response, which I rewrote. (capsule = sphere-capped cylinder) Sometimes, the less dirty fix does make it into the game. :)",1250843315

777189,comment,775282,775450,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>logic in the presentation layer</i><p>Sometimes logic belongs in the presentation layer (if it is related to showing the information to the user).<p>Take the ""if"" tag for example. It doesn't support complex conditions (values can only be tested for values of truth, and it doesn't support parenthesis to define precedence) and adding an if block inside another if block is just ugly. To get around this, you usually construct a boolean value inside your view, but it often happens that this value is only relevant for one template (i.e. HTML). And if your view also returns JSON / YAML, that's not clean.<p>Also, QuerySets are lazy by default, and it goes beautifully hand in hand with caching template fragments, and this works for me since I usually can't cache whole pages (some fragments are more dynamic than others). But if you move template logic in your view, then you're going to have to worry about caching in your view too, duplicating logic.<p>Also, the if tag doesn't support ""ifelse"" ... what's up with that? Are designers too stupid to use ifelse properly?<p>Yes, I know you can create your own tags, but it would've been nice if these things worked out of the box, and it's not OK to define a tag that's not reusable (like in the case of a complex ""if"" condition that can't be expressed in the template directly), because that's extra work that doesn't pay off.<p>And since we are talking about designer-friendliness, how are designers going to understand working with such non-standard tags all over the place?<p>Now, thus far the Django templates haven't been much of a problem for me, but the projects I worked on in Django have been pretty simple. But I know they are not enough so I'm currently looking for alternatives (fortunately it is easy to replace).",1250842686

I can't make any excuses for SOAP (maybe someone else wants to take that up), but COM, at its core, is indeed a simple and dare I even say elegant technology. COM is alive and well on Windows, because it still serves a basic need (cross-language binary interop) and it does so well.<p>The problem is that COM just couldn't stay simple -- the basic idea of querying an object for reference-counted interfaces was quickly buried under incomprehensible layers of pUnkOuter and IMoniker and apartment states and OLE activation sites and god knows what other stuff that you have to know about but doesn't help you getting work done.<p>I've seen people who can get carried away adding layers of stuff to something simple and beautiful without ever realizing that it stopped being simple and beautiful quite a while ago, because <i>they</i> still understand everything.

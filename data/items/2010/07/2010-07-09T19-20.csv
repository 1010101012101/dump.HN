Apple is being pretty gangster in shipping iAds and attacking Google where it would hurt their bottom line.<p>With respect to revenue for third-party developers, Apple's competitive advantage is the 125 million credit cards in iTunes.  Google needs to roll out Checkout worldwide.  I suspect that will take 18 to 24 months.  Then let's be generous and say they can add 50 million credit cards each year.  That's 5 years to catch up.<p>5 years.<p>It's not about open vs closed.  It's not about technology.  It's about dollars.<p>There are many advantages to the web.  One disadvantage is the amount of friction between your wallet and my wallet.  The App Store is about as frictionless as you can get.<p>If Google wants to promote development for the web then they or a third-party payments system (PayPal? Amazon?) that users trust have to step up.<p>It's not about market share.  It's about average revenue per user.  It's about lifetime value of customer.

Worked on the lexer for my scripting language project. It's all hand-rolled because that's how I've always done it - and I stick to simple syntax anyway. I'm actually doing this because I'm stalling a bit on the runtime model.

For instance, after implementing some machine learning software in Scala, I ended up rewriting it in C++, because it was so slow (IIRC the Scala version was 50x slower). The only way you can get down to 'a couple of times' slower is by writing Scala as Java with a slightly different syntax. And since the program does many repeated matrix calculations in a loop, parallelizing the C++ version was done in half an hour (mostly testing where lock contention kills the advantage of parallelization).<p>Yes, I do realize that there are more applications of multicore processing than number crunching ;).",1278705114

For instance, OpenMP makes parallelizing some loops in C/C++ a walk in the park, and I have parallelized some of my programs by adding only a few pragmas.<p>The 'FP makes concurrency easier' is a often-used selling point, but I think the jury is still out. First of all, many functional languages are impure, and do not have this advantage in the same manner that e.g. Haskell has. Second, purity can be an expensive trade-off due to the copying involved. For lots of things (e.g. fast linear algebra) you'll still want to work in an impure world.<p>I think a better selling point of some functional languages is clarity.

Their advertising revenue is no - doubt robust as a consequence.<p>I keep reminding myself, that despite Google's history as a bait and switch (from ""no advertising"" to biggest ad agency in their economy) the most significant thing they've done is make the general public aware of the value in archive, in scanned works, out of copyright works, and even - allowing this is hugely contentious - in the value of capturing storing and promoting ""abandoned"" works, the value of which no-one likely knows. I've strong reservations as to Google's approach. But if you read William Patry, their counsel for copyright, you couldn't find a more lucid general, philosophical approach to why what they do is not against the spirit of copyright law. (which views i believe he held before he joined Google) . Oops, touching on a huge subject, but my private view is that because Google can do this, whether they effectively monetise it or not, they are alerting a vast cross-section of the population to the idea there's value in old works, scanning, digital preservation. Having run a ""ancient work"" preservation project more than a decade ago, which flunked as budget was really beyond a small outfit who had to turn income more directly, and the quality ambition was high even by current expectations, the thing which bugged me was the number of people who suggested the effort was futile, of no particular value. Now, of course, i get told how such projects are futile because Google will just do them, but there's more art to preservation than they are generally doing - they showed the mass route and network effects can be done. Some of the stuff i was involved in capturing simply isn't even in national libraries. Not bitter or anything, in fact just jealous i'd not been born a decade or two later to enjoy all of this when i was in education, thinking i'd not have dropped out had i been able to do so much research so readily i'd have quickly understood my interests the better :)",1278704363

The average consumer seldom cares, and mostly doesn't even know, how large a company is.  Consumers want products to solve problems and make their lives easier.  That's it.",1278703719

One benefit of buying this way is that we have gained an understanding of just how difficult farming is.  Listening to him talk about weening a hundred calves, or caring for his animals over the winter under several feet of snow, or dealing with the heat in the summer helps me appreciate the work and his desire to farm in a sustainable way.  Personally, I'm glad my kids get to experience it, since it's unlikely they would get an appreciate of the work it takes to produce good food otherwise.",1278702381

He attacked in all the right places and his SPEED was incredible. By the time the market had any chance to react even slightly BOOM new revolutionary product. iPod finally got some competitors... BOOM iPhone. The tried this with the iPad but... not cheap enough means that Android can fill the needed gaps since android does not have the Apple Markup. As more and more developers flock to Android Apple will lose.<p>The thing is that Apple makes it's money in a correct way. Just use our damn products because our hardware is where the money's at. Apple does not have the insane-o  license checking for their operating systems, a battle that microsoft is fighting, and an uphill battle it is. They make 40% on iMac, 22% on iPhone, they don't care about the rest, the rest is to boost these numbers.<p>The problem was that a mistake was made. The iPad is too expensive and there is no iPad lite. If there was a 300 dollar iPad and a 500 dollar one, then android would have gotten shot in the kneecaps and would be dragging it's useless bottom across the moble battlefield... Apple tried the leap of iPod -> iPhone -> iPad, but the last leap was not as grand.<p>Yet they did succeed in one area. MS is dead. We are just waiting for the vultures. Unless Steve Jobs switches to Microsoft, all hope is lost. Why? Because windows is irrelevant. Windows 7 is CATCHING UP to Mac OS. And that is the CORE of Microsoft. MS Office is available on mac yet again, Steam (games) just moved to mac and is promoting mac development. Pretty soon people will simply jump ship with MS. Now apple does not allow Mac OS to be installed on non apple machines because... 40% of their revenue is in the apple hardware. If Mac OS was released as available on all hardware, nobody would by mac hardware... its expensive. We can't all afford the apple premium. It'll be the super upper class hardware that dell offers, but it's not. Apple will be forced to make up profits on the iPad/iPod/iPhone sales, which it can't. So apple does the right thing: Compete on less fronts with vendor lock-in.<p>O well. Farewell Microsoft, we hardly knew ye. All Hail Google.",1278702326

I know just how to answer this question.<p>The absolute best resource for competitions - well, that I've found so far - is a little website called train.usaco.org . It gives you a ton of practice, starting out easy and growing slowly more difficult, but it always helps you along the way. It's for high school students, but don't let that trick you into thinking it's easy. It's preparation for the IOI, probably one of the hardest coding competitions in the world.<p>The websites topcoder.com and codeforces.com host weekly programming competitions. These are great practice as well to see how you stand and where you can improve. I signed up for both and added them to my calendar.<p>Topcoder also has a wealth of old problems - somewthing on the order of a few thousand. These are great for speed trials. Plus, you can check other coder's solutions to see how they solved certain things. One of the best ways to learn new tactics is to browse through the code of people who solved a problem faster than you. I've picked up some amazing tricks this way.<p>The uva online judge and sphere online judge have literally thousands of problems to solve. I can't say as much about them, since I haven't really delved too deeply into the problemsets on those websites yet - I've mostly stuck to usaco for now.<p>You'll come to value a straightforward approach over using language tricks, especially things that you don't fully understand. If you don't know exactly what your code is doing, debugging (and you <i>will</i> debug it if you don't understand it) becomes a nightmare.<p>I would recommend learning C++. As much as HN tirades against it, it's definitely the fastest language, and it's really not all that bad once you know your way around. Codeforces allows for python, but I've had problems with solutions that take too long sometimes :(<p>Email me at johnfn at gee mail dot com. I'm always looking for people to compete with, and I would be glad to provide hints and tricks if you run into problems :)",1278702080

We previously had managed to get a PR4 with our static holding page through inbound links, optimization etc.  Obviously we are very happy about a PR7  but I really want to know whether others have found that PR can sometimes be incorrect and adjusted by Google.

453622,comment,452341,453508,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Prolonged isolation and meditation will do that to you. I twice spent a week in a Buddhist retreat, meditating under the guidance of monks from Burma pretty much all day long (well, at least I was supposed to, but I made friends with other people on the retreat...) Even without following all the rules you would be surprised what kind of amazing changes can go on in your mind in only one week. It does feel like you're stoned, only every day the trip is completely different. I cannot begin to imagine what happens after years of doing this.<p>Science studies the objective - if other people can't observe an event then it's outside of scientific discourse. Monks do the exact opposite and study the subjective - their own minds. You can't have other people observe your thoughts, but you can talk about them and verify that the processes you go through are similar to the processes of other people.<p>Monastic lifestyle is absolutely fascinating, from the first glance it might seem incredibly boring. I think of the two retreats as some of the most interesting moments in my life. It's at the very least as fun to do as starting a startup or going to a university.",1233142191

453613,comment,453319,453604,0,0,mqt,,,"lispm, from reddit:<p><pre><code>    There are different strategies to create CL applications.  \n    \n    - save an executable image. This will mostly dump the Lisp system and\n    when you start it up, you have mostly everything back. The size\n    of the dumped image depends on the size of your Lisp system. SBCL\n    is already large and does not have any special features to make\n    it smaller. CLISP for example writes much smaller images than\n    SBCL. Clozure CL is also smaller. Here also is important with how\n    much debug information the original Lisp image was created. The\n    saved image typically will include all that. Corman CL on Windows\n    compresses the Lisp data to save space. \n    \n    - deliver an application. That's for example what LispWorks and\n    Allegro CL can do. They allow functionality and\n    information (debug info, documentation strings, arglists, source\n    locations, symbols, caches, ...) to be removed (for example by\n    treeshaking, or by removing whole functionality groups). The size\n    of the generated application will depend on what you leave out\n    and which delivery level you are choosing. Stuff that might not\n    be needed: compiler, debugger, disassembler, editor, inspector,\n    REPL, ...\n    \n    - deliver a static application. I don't know which currently\n    maintained CL implementation does that. There were several Common\n    Lisp implementations that generate 'small' and static C code from\n    Lisp. CLICC, Ibuki's CONS, WCL, Lisp-to-C, ThinLisp were in that\n    league. They were used for application delivery, where the\n    application might be really small and does not have any large\n    runtime or development environment.\n    \n    There are also some other options. Probably ABCL could generate a\n    JAR file that could be started with an installed JVM. Often Lisp\n    compilers can compile code to native code compiled files (fasls)\n    and even can append several fasls into one. Then one does need\n    only to ship the fasl file, given that the user has the a Lisp\n    installed that can load the fasl.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7swzs/hello_world_executable_sizes_in_17_languages/c07bd5z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7swzs/hello_wor...</a>",1233141157

Overlays are the waypoints and trails on the map, along with metatdata about the places.

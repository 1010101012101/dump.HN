So while this does not mean that someone has something interesting to say if you are purchasing products or services for your company (or looking for ideas to fund) having someone have some skin in the game and not mass spraying everyone, to me anyway, has benefit.<p>Added: I was told the other day by a business owner that they received a rc helicopter by UPS the other day, minus the transmitter which the salesman would bring if they would hear his pitch.

The cost for having me do this is $25 if I decide that he should give some thought to your product.

SDQ also uses CRC checking on the message packets, so a CRC generator would be on the chip. Somewhat confusingly, Chipworks refer to CRC as a security feature, perhaps trying to tie into the authentication angle, but of course any serial protocol has some sort of CRC checking just to discard packets corrupted by noise.</i><p>So until someone finds a truly dumb Lightning charging cable, the question as to whether or not DRM prevents it is alive.",1356115822

Doesn't even matter if they're smart, but a well-informed person should have a basic grasp of how constitutional law works.<p>Some basic problems in this thread:\n1.  The U.S. Constitution does not exist in a vacuum.  You can't just read it and make a pronouncement on what it means.  It has been applied and interpreted by the courts for over two hundred years, and case law, especially Supreme Court cases, are necessary parts of understanding the Constitution.  I'd have to look again, but I don't think there's a single comment in this thread where case law is used to provide authority/support for someone's assertions. In other words, people are just spouting off with irrelevant crap.  (All of this is true regardless of what Scalia or anyone else says about ""plain meaning""; their plain meaning is often not plain to others (need to look at cases), and/or they pick and choose what they think is plain and what's not).<p>2.  It may seem counterintuitive, but there is no such thing as an ""absolute"" right.  At least not in any human legal system.  Rights sometimes conflict with other rights (in which case at least one needs to be limited), rights are (and always have been) limited when they conflict with what courts determine to be a ""compelling"" government interest (need to read case law and reason by legal analogy to understand if any particular situation may rise to level of ""compelling"" interest), and they can be limited in less restrictive ways when the government's interest does not rise to the level of being ""compelling"".  In other cases we may speak of a right as being absolute, e.g., right against ""cruel and unusual punishment"", but it should be obvious to anyone in U.S. over last ten years that that right depends on how courts interpret ""cruel and unusual"", i.e, it's flexible.<p>Those, I think, are two main things.  But, really, without my even saying those it should be clear to anyone reading this thread that it's conducted at the level of two (earnest but uninformed and perhaps inebriated) college freshman debating late at night in their dorm room.<p>3.  Another smaller thing.  In some cases people in this thread have tried to interpet the language of the Constitution.  Many of these attempts at interpretation are laughably bad, don't involve careful reading.  If people coded with such little attention to detail programs would be crashing right and left.  (Of course, the text of the Constitution is not program code, like any laws laid out in human language they're subject to interpretation, often misinterpretation.)",1356115078

I'm impressed and encouraged by the number of people who think that this is a good idea.<p>To the others, I wouldn't think of this as a replacement for e-mail.  E-mail is great for a majority of communications.  Framing messaging from a historical perspective helps understand where our company fits.<p>Prior to the internet when you wanted to communicate with someone you had to attach value to that message.  Whether it was a letter, long distance phone call, telegram, or other form of communication the cost and the time that it took to send were non-zero.  The cost was also apparent to the recipient, which often had an impact on the recipient's likelihood of replying. The internet has done a terrific job unburdening messages of their cost and the amount of time it takes to send them.  At the same time, it has created a problem of a small signal-to-noise ratio.<p>Consider a journalist who I would like to cover a story.  With a list of 800 journalist's emails I can send 800 emails instantly.  At the same time, with each journalist I am competing with hundreds of other message senders.  This includes people with bad ideas for a news story who suffer no transaction cost in sending their messages.  If I could communicate my value on the that journalist's time I could rise about the noise and communicate that idea more successfully.  The system wouldn't be perfect, but I am betting that the overlap between people who place real value on a recipient's time and people who are offering value to the recipient is larger than the overlap between people who place no value on a recipient's time and people who are offering value to that recipient.<p>There's also a lot of discussion as to what these credits are worth.  Right now, they're pixels on a screen.  Scarce pixels.  As we grow an ecosystem of message-sending, some people and companies may decide that they would like to purchase credits at a discount and offer to do things like paypal money or send discount codes for certain number of credits.  At first though, the credits won't be the point.  The point will be that we will provide a service for those people which will allow them to filter out people who place zero value on their attention.<p>Ill address twitter sign-in quickly.  When you log on to Gramicon the users who float to the top of your find users page are the ones you follow on twitter.  Here is a list of people who you have already identified as interesting or notable.  Next to their usernames you can see the average price in order to get a reply as well as their user-generated rating.

With that think of the traffic wardens and say hello, they are people as well.  Though most think you are some kind of crazy for even saying hello to them as they have a installed fear of all members of the public due to intereactions with angry drivers.

In most US states, there is no registration of guns.<p>When you purchase a gun from a gun store, you fill out a form 4473, for the purposes of a background check.  The ATF has a record of gun transfers, but not a list of who currently owns a gun.  If they recover a gun from a crime scene, then can go through the records to see who was the last owner.<p>The kink in this system is that private sales of guns is legal in most states as well.  No background check, no record keeping required, just a good faith effort to ensure that the person you're selling it to can legally own a firearm.<p>So if the police come knocking on your door and ask for your guns, you can simply say ""I sold it 2 years ago, but unfortunately I didn't keep any information on the new owner.""  The police would then need to have probable cause to search your residence for the weapon (which they very well could get depending on the evidence they have).<p>Collecting all the guns in the US won't be an easy task.",1356113978

Linked in are the LLVM libs and a bunch of C code that is converted to LLVM IR and accessed by the shaders.

4953762,comment,4953423,4953423,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"The Second Amendment is controversial and deserves to be. These were men who just overthrew their British government, violently. They were maltreated, but their government was far from the most tyrannical at the time. In 1775, you'd rather be an average American colonist (healthier, richer, taller, more literate) than an average European. Now the Irish... they had something to complain about regarding British tyranny. For the Americans, it was more gray. They had to ""invent"" the right to overthrow an oppressive or ineffective government because that's exactly what they were doing.<p>The Second Amendment <i>is</i> the right to violently oppose government if it becomes tyrannical and violent, and it's the right to use the most effective weapons available. (In 1789, they were muskets and swords. Problem: in 2012, they're much more powerful and frequently used for illegal and harmful purposes.) It's a bizarre construct, because it's unclear where the line between personal violence (objectively illegal) and overthrow (which would be treated as illegal, even if it's held as abstractly legitimate) is. We also learned in the 1860s that this whole idea (of legitimate overthrow) is extremely dangerous.<p>In 2012, governments are less powerful. We have a relatively libertarian government, despite protest to the contrary. Consequently, there is absolutely no good reason for a violent revolution against in the US against the government. (Corporations, especially in the multinational theater, require a separate debate.) In fact, we have a legitimate, effective mechanism for firing bad government officials and the problem is that <i>we don't use it</i>. Incumbent politicians have more job security (< 2% firing rate per year) than Silicon Valley software engineers. That's on us.<p>I agree that the best way to ""revolt"" against bad government is to use nonviolent tools to delegitimize incompetent or crooked leaders. Right now, the political structures that exist to enable that (periodic elections, removal from office by the people) work. They work well, and no one is violently preventing them from doing so, so violence is neither necessary nor morally acceptable. What we should be doing is using legitimate means (e.g. Internet) to remove incompetent leaders from office. If, however, the U.S. turned into Syria (which is extremely unlikely) I'd disagree.<p>The problem right now is that a gun that is fired on a person in the US is, statistically, more likely to be used in suicide, by accident, or on an innocent person, than on a criminal. We don't have a tyrannical government, nor do we have that much crime.<p>Ultimately, I'd say that ""government"" itself doesn't have the right to make certain firearms illegal, but that the people have the right (as an aggregate) to give up that right and to take it back. Personally, I'm willing not to have the right to own an AK-47 (seeing as I don't have one, and have no desire ever to own one) if it will prevent senseless massacres like last week's. But the distinction is important. The people are <i>giving up</i> the right to have one, in exchange for increased safety.",1356113356

Those were the effective tools of the revolution back then.  But since we started rolling tanks, bombers, and aircraft carries off the assembly lines, the citizens ability to match power with our potentially 'tyrannical' government is nil.""<p>To be clear, a bunch of farmers with muskets in the late 18th Century were not capable of beating a late 18th Century military in the field, or ""match power"" with it.  Armies weren't formed for kicks, guys: they were by far the most powerful means of projecting force of the day.  We mythologize the American Revolution as being a bunch of sharp-shooters who beat the dumb redcoats by not being an army, but that's not true.  We had to form an army, with artillery and cavalry support, with discipline, that formed into ranks and did army things, to win the Revolution.  We also used people with experience in the British Army to form the Colonial Army, and got plenty of help from the French and the Germans.<p>What a militia of disorganized people with guns could do, then and just as much now, is provide a visible, nettling presence to occupiers that allowed an actual rebellion to form around them (or, more likely, fail to form around them).  Our disastrous adventure in Iraq should make it perfectly clear to anyone doubting it that tanks, aircraft, and cruise missiles do NOT make a militia irrelevant to the occupation of a country.",1356113011

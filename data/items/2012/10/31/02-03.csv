The PI's last publication (<a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a>) states that they are affiliated with Princeton, so dealing with hazardous materials etc are dealt with Princeton's Environmental health and safety dept. \nThe same applies to animals, radioactive materials etc.<p>It looks like a lot of the details of the experiment are purposely left out of the application as they are looking to appeal to the general public and I think that is a smart thing to do. Putting details into the application would make people's eyes glaze over, so keeping it simple was the correct way to go.<p>From my understanding of their proposal, they are looking to do something quite common in neuroscience research. While I personally haven't done autoradiography, I know people who have and it is a commonly(although not much now) technique that has been used numerous times. \nTo do this as a new lab, without university support would be dangerous, unethical and worrisome, but it seems clear this lab is already established.<p>What they propose seems to be an initial step in a nice project that could lead to something useful. Doing the anatomy (they are basically trying to see where the drug binds within the brain first) and then the molecular techniques makes sense and I wish more labs did stuff like this. \nAs a neuroscientist, I applaud their going outside of the system and I'm happy to see that they will share their data with everyone.",1351651555

You are speculating about human psychology based on your understanding of history. Though you haven't cited any literature to back up your statements, and you haven't claimed that you have knowledge of any psychological literature, I still find your opinion valuable.<p>I've read some of the literature related to this question. Here is one thing it says: psychopaths are people who almost never feel empathy. They decide to take many actions and many of those actions have disastrous and extremely harmful consequences for those around them. The harm they do is grossly out of proportion compared to the harm committed by non-psychopaths. They are extremely exploitative and cruel and disproportionately commit a large number of crimes.<p>Psychopaths are now roughly defined, by researchers, as people who don't experience empathy. If you want to see how people without empathy behave, look no further than the psychopath.<p>It's not pretty, and it contradicts your idea here.<p>A psychologist who specializes in psychopathy is Dr. Stout, who wrote several famous books about this topic.<p>The research shows that lack of empathy absolutely and unequivocally leads to hurting others. The actions of those who lack empathy hurt other people in far greater proportion. Operating empathetically involves feeling rather than logical thinking and it requires being in touch with your emotions.<p>""The road to hell"" phrase refers to INTENTIONS, not EMPATHY. Intentions are cognitive, they are analytical. So good intentions may be meaningless (if this proverb has any truth) because good intentions are NOT empathy.

The problem is that you can trick yourself quite easily into ""discovering"" things which end up not meaning much. So you do need some care, and perhaps someone to help guide you. For beginners, I'd say LSD's bigger benefit is being able to reshape how you think and handle life rather than understanding some new data structures. It's definitely a ""must do this at least once in a lifetime"" type of thing.<p>Stimulants are fantastic. Amphetamines provide focus as well as a nice perky feeling to keep you happy while coding. Ritalin (methylphenidate) works too, but I find it harsher and not as pleasant as speed. As the name hints, it makes you fast at things. Talking, thinking, calculating, coding. I notice with Ritalin, doing mental math happens instantaneously - I surprise myself. The focus can be a drawback: if you don't plan, you can end up focusing on something ""interesting"" yet time wasting. So prepare your day, first.<p>Opiates (such as time release oxycodone) are fantastic for keeping optimism. By keeping your mind in the right state, you can end up being much more productive. Again, the benefit is the drawback: being overly optimistic means your risk calculations and general decision management might be way off. (Biggest downside here is addiction, but it _is_ manageable, at least if you have money.)<p>Pot I've not found useful for much as far as work.

Therapists and psychiatrists aren't required to have any more knowledge of neurochemistry than any other doctor; they'll be able to follow a guide and tell you that if you're depressed they should take you through cognitive behavioral therapy and prescribe you an SSRI (and then an SNRI if that doesn't work, and then a TCA if that doesn't work, &c) but they probably <i>won't</i> think about the serotonin production pathway and suggest that you might need more Vitamin B. This is one benefit of the internet: the people who are experts on their little staked claim of knowledge can give it to the people who seem to need it, instead of those people having to go around and talk to experts in all sorts of different fields to get the perspectives from those fields. On the other hand, it's pretty useless to give these pieces of advice to no-one in particular, without a specific problem at hand to solve. It's a bit like doing science without a hypothesis to test; everyone sees their own--more often than not false and overreaching--interpretation of the data.<p>The one good thing that does come out of these threads is that they tend to get more people to say ""wait, that sounds like me, maybe I have [X mood disorder],"" ask their doctors about it, and it turns out that they <i>do</i>. This is in stark contrast to usual hypochondria surrounding most diseases; where a person will be quick to diagnose themselves with [X cargo-cult symptom-matching thing-they-don't-understand] to explain why their neck always aches or they keep coughing up yellow phlegm, people are wary of assigning themselves mood disorders, since most people feel that society will still consider them ""guilty"" in some way for having the problem [""you're just lazy"" &c], and they definitely don't want to bring it out in the open to the point where they <i>identify</i> with it. Discussions with a bunch of people chiming in to say ""oh, yes, I thought I was [X fault-of-character], but really I just had [Y chemical imbalance] and some [drug] fixed it right up"" can really push people to investigate this sort of thing where they otherwise wouldn't consider it.<p>I think the best compromise is that <i>solutions</i> should be discussed in the context of particular <i>problems</i>. Nootropics are an exception, because they don't solve any particular problem, other than the problem of wanting your life to be ""even better-er""; but, for example, a root-level comment in this discussion about marijuana use really won't have anything good happen to it; each person will be looking at it in the context of a different problem and either implicitly accepting or rejecting the idea <i>prima facie</i> because of that. Better to ask a specific question, like ""what drugs and/or therapies could be used to cope with stress-induced anxiety in the workplace""; then the discussion could actually go somewhere worth reading :)",1351649476

There needs to be a lot of trust in employer-employee relationships.""<p>Tomorrow will be the end of my first 3 months in the Valley, and let me say the one aspect in which the Valley is vastly, 180 degrees, different from the rest of the country, is this ""moral flexibility"" business. I've worked over a decade in the east coast, and things are much more old fashioned back there in this aspect...people respect job contracts, put things down on paper, worry about hiring/firing and the impact it will have on the new hire, his family, healthcare etc. Not so in the valley. I got involved with a yc company too, and this is what transpired - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4567857"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4567857</a><p>It wasn't remotely pleasant...and while it all worked out in the end ( in the sense I got a diff job at a diff non-yc company) , it did leave a horrible taste in the mouth. The folks running the show were ...I hate to use the word...scamsters. Literally. You try these sort of stunts in a big company, people will take you to the cleaners. Its just that out here, you have the weight of the VC's & their billions behind you, coupled with the fact that you can always claim you are ""just a startup"" and so this sort of behavior is on par.<p>Its an awesome thing for the startup community & the ecosystem at large - this moral flexibility - because it adds to the incredible speed at which you can iterate & pivot & all that jazz. But it does suck to be an employee at one of these gigs...you are at the receiving end of juvenile behavior & you have no recourse.",1351649378

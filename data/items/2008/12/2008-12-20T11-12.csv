It's just crunching numbers.<p>Perhaps it is cleanly separated, I haven't looked.",1229774281

404489,comment,403869,403998,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Yes but I think his argument is that ranking apps by volume creates an incentive to compete solely on price in order to get the volume in order to get the visibility in order to get the volume... Kind of like if expensive low volume laptops at an electronics store were stacked away somewhere in the basement.<p>But I don't agree with his conclusion that this is not a free market. Every market is organised according rules that someone artificially creates. It is up to sellers and buyers whether they want to use that market or not. So there is a market of markets and that's what makes each of them free.<p>Of course Apple's dominant position in that particular market of iPhone app markets is a problem for everyone. That's why I would think very hard before I creating apps on top of someone elses proprietary platform. I'm not saying I wouldn't do it or that it's somehow unethical. I'm just making the observation that these are the problems that come with proprietary platforms.",1229772946

It means that you're as close as possible to O(n) or better yet O(1) as your workload increases, whatever that workload is.",1229772457

Figure out ways to differentiate and complement others so that people who use and like other services don't feel personally threatened by your advertising.<p>Even if it is really obvious you are competing with someone, don't say it that out loud, since you are likely to fork into a different business model from them as you grow and find your own niche. Playing nicely with others will get you more positive buzz from the community, and you'll be perceived as a better partner by others if you play nicely.:<p>""Adsense for X, Wozad for Y"".<p>Also, if you want to fight Google head on you're likely to lose. Better to find a niche, start making money and use that to improve your service.",1229771994

Which I guess is a part of the whole ""Python supports multiple programming paradigms (primarily object oriented, imperative, and functional)"" thing.

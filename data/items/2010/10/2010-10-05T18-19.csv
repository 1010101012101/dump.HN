It is well defined what it means for an algorithm to be correct -- it means that it returns expected output for a given input. Ambiguous situations you are talking about are when the <i>problem</i> is not well defined. That is why I used the word ""algorithm"" in my first comment. Trial and error is perfectly fine when we are not exactly sure what result we expect, but we will ""feel"" when it's good enough. It is unacceptable if we know exactly what the result should be, though.<p>When the problem is well-defined, like word-wrapping, or sorting, or whatever, if you blindly stagger and write code hoping it will work, instead of stopping to think <i>why</i> it should work, you are doing it wrong.",1286305071

a)   the so called XML tax : Agreed XML is not the best representation of information  but it does seem to be particularly suited for build tasks.
Ant's plug in tasks give you a lot of leeway -- a prudent  programmer would know how not to hang herself or himself. I hope for the writer's sake that the example he chose is not from his actual project. If it is, then the writer should probably find a different line of work.<p>b) Netbeans now supports  Maven 'natively'.  And before that, I have been faithfully and successfully upgrading my Netbeans  version while working on enterprise scale applications.
The problems that the writer mentions are either  exaggerations or a reflection of his ineptitude.<p>c) Maven : it took me a while to wrap my head around it and I hated learning how to write plugins -- in xml. But it was worth the effort. I implemented a Continuous Integration build system for my project that builds an EAR with over 1.2 million line of code.<p>Maven just works  -- once you have put in the effort to learn the platform. The writer has not put in any effort towards that. In fact the maven problem he talks about is actually  a quote  from a third party. This guy really does not know what he is talking about.<p>Don't get me wrong -- ant and maven are far from perfect ; but this article only betrays the writer's  ignorance and lack of skill.<p>And then he goes  on to recommend Rake .

In that case, in the US, any information stored by an ISP can be retrieved without a warrant 6 months (I'd need to confirm its not 120 days) after the incident. Those cases fall under the interpretation of a message overheard. In 5th Amendment cases, if you say a message in a crowded room, you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy and this is how any message on the internet is interpreted legally.

He's not a technical person but he sure knows how to find good technical people. His trick is to get good people to come to <i>him</i> by setting up events, conferences and pub meetups around interesting topics (e.g. the latest JVM language or Agile development practices). Of course, 90% of the people who go there aren't looking for jobs but I expect he does pretty well out of the 10% that are.<p>I think this is actually the right way to go about recruitment. Don't spam 100s of people on the off chance they're currently unhappy and looking to move. Just set up an environment which attracts the best people in the industry but also allows them to consider new opportunities. Not only that but as a recruiter you are immersed in the world you are recruiting for and cannot help learn and understand more about it (e.g. this morning I got an email on the list mentioning a possible talk about Jaskell - a language I hadn't even heard of but apparently, my recruiter has :)).",1286301797

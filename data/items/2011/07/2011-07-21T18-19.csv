In the US, we routinely blame the governments of China and Russia for hacks that could easily be perpetuated by high schoolers who live there.  No doubt, DPRK would blame our official institutions, giving them much more legitimacy (at least internally, but probably internationally too) when they claim that the world is out to get them.",1311274756

2790770,comment,2789540,2790695,8,0,Create,,,"The documentary shows the development of the contemporary business corporation, from a legal entity that originated as a government-chartered institution meant to effect specific public functions, to the rise of the modern commercial institution entitled to most of the legal rights of a person. One theme is its assessment as a ""personality"", as a result of an 1886 case in the United States Supreme Court in which a statement by Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite[nb 1] led to corporations as ""persons"" having the same rights as human beings, based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The film's assessment is effected via the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-IV; Robert Hare, a University of British Columbia psychology professor and a consultant to the FBI, compares the profile of the contemporary profitable business corporation to that of a clinically-diagnosed psychopath. The documentary concentrates mostly upon North American corporations, especially those of the United States.<p>The film is in vignettes examining and criticizing corporate business practices. It establishes parallels between the way corporations are systematically compelled to behave and the DSM-IV's symptoms of psychopathy, i.e. callous disregard for the feelings of other people, the incapacity to maintain human relationships, reckless disregard for the safety of others, deceitfulness (continual lying to deceive for profit), the incapacity to experience guilt, and the failure to conform to social norms and respect for the law.<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Corporati...</a>",1311274671

""Get attention"" is literally the only [1] useful thing Anonymous is actually capable of doing, remember -- they can release documents to bring them to people's attention, make statements to influence people's opinion, etc. There is no need to inform people that the government of North Korea is corrupt, because everyone already knows it's corrupt. It'd be like informing people that oxygen is a really nice thing to breathe.<p>The prospect for literally ""attacking"" most organizations is kind of weak. Most of the corrupt governments in the world aren't very technologically advanced, so disrupting their computer systems wouldn't do much good. I'm sure Anonymous would love to go after Blackwater, I [and probably they] just have no idea how Anonymous could go after Blackwater.<p>[1] -- okay, not <i>only</i>.

2790760,comment,2790187,2790442,11,0,code_duck,,,"The issues with the API are not entirely technical. It's not entirely fair to blame the API engineering team for problems there.<p>At one point, Etsy had an employee, a PM, who acted as a developer liaison. He left and was not replaced, and the contact became an engineer. They current crew does not appear to have any experience, flair for or interest in customer service.<p>Communication has always been a problem. This has always been a problem with Etsy (going on up to and coming down from Kalin). The API devs are inconsistent regarding warning about changes and making changes. Sometimes there will be an elaborate system to make sure everyone is prepared for some piece of data changing from ""content"" to [""content""] in three weeks. Other times, they do things like change the way OAuth signatures are calculated without warning.<p>Yes, that's right: after being asked for years to give more warning for changes which may cause service interruption or compatibility problems, Etsy moved their API off of Mashery to their own platform <i>with no warning whatsoever</i>.<p>Generally, when one requests something from the Etsy API team, the answer will be ""No, that is impossible"".  For instance, a request for announcements to be made on a separate mailing list. The answer was that this was impossible. They did implement a change log, which is poorly maintained and incomplete. They release changes on Fridays at 4:30 PM, then leave for the weekend. This is actually a cultural issue at Etsy: they think their business is Mon-Fri, 9-5. They even have less forum moderators on the weekends! Rob Kalin has made this a point of pride, that they 'respect weekends'. Their employees' weekends, that is. This would be great if it made sense for a 24 hour, global web marketplace. There is no API support on weekends.<p>They recently released a shopping cart that requires customers to be authenticated through OAuth. Someone pointed out this isn't very reasonable for many applications, and we were told it was <i>impossible</i> because Etsy's system does not support anonymous carts. Any reasonable engineer could see how this could be done (a temp. ownership transferred to an account, I mean JFC). Someone pointed out that this is how <i>Etsy's own site already functions</i>, and I don't think there was even a response.<p>On the mailing list, questions such as this come up:  <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/etsy-api-v2/browse_thread/thread/fc295ebbb2611a21/9674ae1ce003413f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/etsy-api-v2/browse_thread/thr...</a><p>The fact that Etsy did not even address this for three weeks says enough, does it not?<p>Technical changes at Etsy in general affect the API, and the API devs do not seem to notice these changes until users report problems.  They claim to be doing TDD, unfortunately it seems the wrong tests are being written. One may experience failures such as avatar images being blank for a week straight after some change, and wonder what sort of poorly written test would not catch that.<p>There is no schema provided for any of the data that you can write, and validation rules are incompletely specified when they are available.<p>As for PHP, I do think it's an okay choice for templating and light scripting tasks. I believe a language with actual type checking would be a better choice - Python, Ruby, Java, anything - for a backend task such as this. It's is likely due to sloppy coding, but at different times Etsy has returned ints, floats, strings, and incorrectly formatted strings (""10.5"", ""10,20"") for prices. The overall impression I get is of rather jumbled code beneath the hood.<p>The Etsy API is poorly organized conceptually, also. There is no reasonable map of relations between object types, and often the associations seem backwards (and are not transitive). That is, you might want info on a list of items, but instead you have to get a shop, then an item, then the info from there. As someone who has been around this for longer than the people working on the API team have been, it's clear that whomever is designing the API doesn't really understand how developers or customers use Etsy.<p>Then, there are the glitches. Say you're monitoring a stream of featured products. Everyonce in a  while, there will be a blank space for like 5 hours. Did Etsy stop featuring items during that time? No, looks like their official site was working fine. Is there any explanation or acknowledgment as to why the API shows a gap of five hours? No, the API team probably didn't even notice, and reporting issues such as this is a complete waste of time as experience shows.<p>This is on top of the background issue, which is that the entire company is a mess and has always been a mess. My expectation is that they will be the Friendster or MySpace of this market, because Etsy really is that abysmal.",1311274558

2790691,comment,2789047,2789822,2,0,Arjuna,,,"(I am attempting to repond to both <i>Xurinos</i> and <i>romaniv</i> in a single reply here.)<p>My clean URL example was just an example. I did not intend to infer that the world is primarily navigating via URL manipulation, but it came across that way. Rather, I meant that it can be a nice touch for usability, in certain cases. For example, power users are going to quickly notice, ""Hey, I can find a vehicle by manipulating the URL by using the 'manufacturer_carmodel' pattern."" Of course, the site would have normal search functionality, so that traditional users could locate vehicles in that manner as well. In the end, it is more about SEO, but with the clean URL paradigm, you get both (again, in some cases), so it can be a win-win. Also, the URLs look nice when they appear in search results (i.e., nice keyword-based URLs instead of URLs with query strings and IDs) which can lend itself to readability/usability.<p>Of course, even with clean URLs, a case where it probably does not work is a blog (as noted by <i>romaniv</i>). For example, no one is going to manipulate a long URL string for a blog posting; they will simply navigate the site for the information. Although, here is a real-world example that I have encountered: I have come across multi-part blog postings via Google searches. In many cases, ""Part X"" displays in the search results, but not ""Part 1."" In these cases, it is always nice when these sites are designed with clean URLs, making it a breeze to simply copy the URL from the search results, and change the ""X"" to ""1"". Clearly, this is not easy (or possible) to do if the URL is a query string with an unintuitive article ID.<p>Ultimately, I think that clean URLs are about SEO, but I think they can have a usability factor, again, in some cases and well, for ""power users"" at least. I probably should have said ""power users"" instead of ""users"" in my original post.",1311273803

In both cases, their expenses are negligible compared to their income.

2790620,comment,2788906,2789208,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The Shuttle is a fairly classic example of ""2nd system syndrome"". It was designed to replace every single launch vehicle currently in existence and to become the backbone of manned spaceflight, cargo launches, and military spaceflight. Large payloads were to be assembled in orbit in pieces (a la ISS). Comsats and suchlike were to be launched in the cargo bay far cheaper than any expendable rocket could manage. Military missions were to be conducted with very little prep-time from Vandenberg AFB with polar missions that would fly over Western Russia (Moscow, Leningrad, etc.) and then return in one orbit back to the launch site. Since the Earth would have rotated under the Shuttle's orbit this would require an immense cross-range flight capability (about a thousand miles), this requirement forced the orbiters to have exceptionally large wings and thus a stronger airframe to support them and a more extensive re-entry shielding, both of which significantly increased the dry weight of the vehicle as well as the total area of extremely vulnerable thermal protection systems (such as the much larger wing leading edge carbon-carbon shielding, which led to the disintegration of Columbia on re-entry when it was damaged by iced foam during takeoff). That cross-range flight capability was never used in practice as polar military missions from Vandenberg never came about, though the requirement imposed a heavy burden on the Shuttle's capabilities and costs.<p>The Shuttle was also designed to haul an airlock, rendezvous equipment, and a robotic arm, even though such capabilities are not necessary for every mission, though again the requirements affect the capabilities and cost of every mission. On paper each orbiter was to have flow dozens of times a year, this was a key element of lowering launch costs. In practice the orbiters were not truly reusable and were more refurbishable, the main engines were replaced on each flight, all of the consumables were flushed, the cargo bay liner was removed and replaced, the tile-based thermal shield had to be extensively inspected, etc. in a months long process that steeply limited the flight rate of the orbiters and vastly increased launch costs (ultimately making the Shuttle one of the most expensive launch vehicles of all time).<p>Overall the Shuttles tried to satisfy too many mission requirements and ultimately did not achieve any of them well. And in the process a hugely compromised system which was vastly more expensive and vastly less capable than previous systems was built.",1311272741

After that, it was all ""recipes in spring"" or some other framework, and that was also pretty much the beginning of the end for me with Java.  I don't blame the language so much as I blame the frameworks.",1311271231

If we can't have a good and fair government by the definition of the people, then can we really expect to fix other governments? Do we bring our own government in like we did with Afghanistan and Iraq and royally fuck up a country (not to say that those countries were in good shape in any way, nor to say we could fix them, they are pretty much dictated by oil as there have few other natural resources they can export)<p>I like to think if we had a good government that we can truly trust, then we can trust it to step out and assist worldwide injustices: land aid to the people fighting an oppressive government, enable communication between the oppressed, prevent the oppressive government from buying weapons, etc.",1311271212

In the case of necessities w/ inelastic demand, maybe that's possible.  But w/ products where there are viable alternatives, i don't agree that that's a necessary consequence.<p>And even things like gas usage, there is flexibility in the demand.  There is definitely some driving that has to be done, but people can and do cut back on the amount of travel they take because of gas prices.  Also, there are sometimes alternatives to that means of travel too.",1311271203

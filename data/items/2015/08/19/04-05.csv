The way in which I am displeased with someone who chooses to cheat on their spouse is very different from the way I am displeased with a company who <i>makes money</i> off of getting large numbers of people to cheat on their spouses, and this hack victimizes individuals more than the company. It&#x27;s also very different from the way I am displeased (or really, not displeased) with someone who chose once, in a moment of weakness, to attempt to cheat on their spouse, and thought better of it shortly thereafter, or even someone who did cheat on their spouse, regretted it, apologized, and sought forgiveness. We have no idea from the data how many of those people still have email addresses and credit card numbers on file.<p>I do wish there was a way to distinguish between &quot;Your facts are wrong,&quot; &quot;I disagree with your opinion,&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re off-topic,&quot; or &quot;You might be right and on-topic but you&#x27;re not constructive&quot; when downvoting, especially since HN norms are that the first two are appropriate uses of the downvote button.

My demo wasn&#x27;t signed into, don&#x27;t know about hits because it doesn&#x27;t have analytics. In any case there&#x27;s nothing to see before signing in!<p>It was a very nice lead, and one it&#x27;s been very useful in following. It spurred me to get a demo up and forced me to explain my idea in less than one minute of speech and very few written words. All these things have been very valuable learning experiences and have put my project in a better state now.<p>6500 applications about very early stage ideas, none of which have traction. Imagine trying to pick a few hundred (?) prospects from that pool for interview. Statistically speaking they&#x27;d probably be more likely to pick winners by throwing away 75% at random, and giving that much extra consideration to the remaining pool, such is the level of noise introduced having to try and read and consider 6500 applications in such a short amount of time.<p>Who knows, maybe that&#x27;s precisely what happened, maybe not so explicitly, but perhaps they&#x27;d already picked 95% of their interviewees upon reading the first 25% of applications, so late applications were, statistically, not on the same playing field. I agree with your conclusion there, I think they even say it themselves, strongly implying this is the case (why wouldn&#x27;t it be?).<p>All in all, for others in this boat, don&#x27;t be disappointed or annoyed that your application doesn&#x27;t seem like it was given much consideration. It couldn&#x27;t have been in the end. This was an experiment, it was free money, the application pool included remote teams and was therefore global. No traction or even a demo was required, just a short application form and video. Of course the intense competition was going to wash your idea into a sea of noise. Who with an idea they were working on fairly seriously wouldn&#x27;t apply? Many, many, many great ideas by brilliant people will have been overlooked because of the noise, it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s fault, just a statistical inevitability.<p>Your project is in the same position now as it was before you heard about this, actually probably a bit more advanced with the extra weeks, plus the application process giving you a bit of a kick up the proverbial. You&#x27;ve lost nothing but a potential opportunity, and there are plenty more out there.<p>Crack on!",1439959616

Such as a Stylus REPL, SASS, SCSS etc. all of which, like CoffeeScript, are just JS modules on npm.<p>With compilers like Stylus and SCSS you would probably default the return value to be the compiled CSS, and with Coffee you&#x27;d need a toggle button to show what the compiled JS looks like, though not 100% necessary.<p>With that said, if there was just a way to set up a &quot;build&quot; script for a REPL to set up the environment to achieve the same result. As in, you require(&#x27;stylus&#x27;) then have some global variable stream/buffer, tonic.output, for which you could inject into the module of your choice to generate output, and then save it via tonic.buffer.write() or something.

I have been running that demo occasionally since I happen to have my first computer, an original IBM PC with CGA card, standard PC beeper/speaker, (and no monitor, but this demo uses NTSC to a TV anyway!)<p>Fortunately I also had modem software (Telix) on the PC&#x27;s 20MB hard drive so I could copy the demo over a null modem cable with Zmodem protocol, from a win2k box that also had a serial port, USB port, and hyperterm on it! And I had pkunzip on it already as well to unzip the file. It was so slow! I forgot how it was slow just to unzip files back then. (And to get the file onto THAT computer I had to put it on a USB stick from my windows 7 box because it&#x27;s the one with wifi and USB but no RS-232 serial port.)<p>Now I get why the demo sometimes comes out in black and white when it tries to do 1024 colors.

1025469,comment,1025232,1025458,0,0,nicpottier,,,"XML wasn't really ever made to be high performance though.  It was made to be easy to read for humans and relatively easy to generate.  At those two things it is awesome.  If you are sticking binary data in XML and passing it over the wire to someone you are probably 'doing it wrong'. :)<p>There are obviously much fast formats for that type of thing, but they have their own drawbacks which are significant.  Protocol Buffers are crazy fast but aren't self describing or human readable.  JSON is really just a different representation of XML on many levels and certainly doesn't deal with binary data any more elegantly. (base64 here we come!)<p>If you have binary data and plenty of CPU on both ends, then gzipping XML gets you pretty close to the native size actually and can be a good solution.  You keep the human readability and the compression can be done on the transport layer if it is HTTP.<p>If you don't have much CPU and want easy parsing, it is very easy to write a binary format for XML.  I've done this for products that are sending down data to cell phones (including images).  The native format is XML, because it is easy to author in templates and easy to debug, but with an extra parameter it gets thrown into a denser and very fast to parse format for the other end to deal with.  This costs a bit of CPU on the server, but that generally isn't the problem.<p>Anyways, I would agree that the main author's points are pretty ridiculous.  They either point to him not really understanding XML or never really considering the pros and cons of the alternatives.  XML is great for what it is, and it has its drawbacks, but as a universal transport it is pretty rad.",1262320913

In  my immediate as well as extended family, you are almost EXPECTED to help a family member in this position. The downside to it is you have leecher families that don't work. The upside is I have to go back several generations on my family tree to find a family that is homeless and struggling.<p>Having grown up in the US(I was born in India) I struggle every now and then about this idea of distributed wealth. It often means fewer vacations even if you are making a killing because you always have someone in your extended family who isn't as well off and needs your help. Longterm though there is no doubt I prefer this shared wealth model. If this guy was in our family he would not be homeless. I know this because at any given time we have a family who is in his position. The larger family helps and in most cases they rebound again and no longer need help.<p>In my immediate family, we all agreed a while ago that any individual venture by my brothers will be equally owned by all three of us. My uncles have a similar agreement.",1262320819

How to strip those characters out of your input files in PHP is still one of my most popular blog posts.<p>XML is horrible for binary data, and the pedantry of parsers makes it worse.",1262320749
1025466,comment,1024850,1024850,0,0,dstorrs,,,"Here's a question:  how many terrorism attempts have there been against US airlines since 9/11?  For that matter, what is the total number of US flights that have EVER been attacked by terrorists?  I'm including both successful attacks and ones where the attack was foiled.<p>This is a serious question--perhaps this is a much bigger threat than I'm aware.  But according to my risk assessment, airline terrorism is such a low-order threat that it's just not worth getting exercised about.  I agree that the TSA accomplishes little or nothing, but I feel perfectly safe--the odds that I will be on a plane that is attacked by a hijacker are almost infinitesimal.",1262320721

They're also rarely useful but that's another issue.</i><p>It's incredibly strange that you view not twittering, spending time on stackoverflow, or blogging as not doing anything.<p>By that standard, absolutely all of the best people I've worked with in the past decade are useless, and some of the worst people I've worked with pass your test with flying colors.<p>I'm not generalizing to the idea that bloggers and stackoverflow users are all useless.  I'm taking the far more sane position that blogging, twittering and stockoverflowing are uncorrelated to work ethic and talent.",1262320606

Put all four together and I'm not sure where the story is.  Actually _finding_ a job with all four strikes against you would make for quite a story, actually.<p>I empathize with the guy though - that has to be an amazingly tough slog, coming to a new city, unable to shelter his family, and then having a family loan fall through at the last moment.  The only good news is that it looks like he's found a place to live.<p>In general though, I don't think we can use it as an anecdote to accurately reflect the opportunities available for the hacker community in the valley.

There wouldn't be nearly as many performance issues if they'd used something akin to Thrift, Protobuf, or even the woefully misunderstood ASN.1 DER.<p>Since XMPP uses XML, they've had to define complex out-of-band protocols for transfering file data, instead of simply sending the data in-line as simple <i>binary</i> XMPP messages.<p>I could not more strongly disagree with your position.

So his degree doesn't earn him any brownie points at any employers.<p>Secondly, there are a <i>lot</i> of web dev (but we're talking backend code also, not just frontend dev) in the Seattle area, and we are hiring like mad. That being said, the big names around here source from all over the <i>world</i>, not to mention all over the USA - if you do not have a prestigious degree, and/or years of experience and a portfolio that blows people away, you will go nowhere real fast.<p>At the risk of being presumptuous, but having seen this particular story too many times, it sounds like he had a lot of illusions about what it would take to succeed as a web dev, and expected his education to carry him through his job search, where the reality was that experience trumps almost everything else in this field.<p>I imagine moving to SF made all of the above worse, not better.",1262319011

(The richest markets are high competition, high stress, and also tend to be highly concentrated in fields where I would not like to make a living.  For example, as a consequence of running a squeaky clean website in bingo, I rank fairly well and have been offered impressive sums of money to be less than squeaky clean.  I don't want to promote gambling -- ever.  That isn't even a moral thing with me, since I'm fine with gambling in moderation -- I'd just much prefer to be the software guy at $45k a year than the gambling tycoon at $4.5 million a year.)",1262318777

299889,comment,299851,299851,0,0,Protophore,,,"I heard about this a month or so ago on NPR.  I don't see the benefit in it really.  Unless they can back their currency with gold or something else it will continue to fluctuate in value with the pound.<p>Furthermore I can't see why people would really want to have this town's currency other than as a collectors item.  You can only spend it in this particular town, and not even at all of the businesses there.<p>It's been said that this will help keep business (money) in town.  Meaning that locals will be more likely (forced) to spend money at local businesses if they have the local currency.  But why would anyone want to restrict themselves like this as a shopper?  What's to stop them for refusing to accept change in the local currency or to trade it in at the bank for official British currency?",1220999614
299888,comment,299451,299733,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"The thing with perl threads is that pretty much nobody uses them.  They work fine, as far as I know, but with a default 16MB stack size and ""share nothing"" semantics don't start more than a few.  Perl is more unix centric and people just prefer to fork and use the well baked IPC mechanisms.  Various libraries such as POE make fork+IPC easy enough that it's hard to see the need for threads in the kinds of domains where a language like perl is applicable.",1220999605

You would still have to report paying them the money.<p>You could pay them under the table (not report it to the government) in cold hard cash using the British pound just as easily as using a local currency.  I can't see how using a local currency would make it any easier.",1220999250

299876,comment,299137,299771,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Golly. It's amazing that every single provider of healthcare would conspire to keep me sick, so I would never notice that customers of health care company A are healthier than customers of B. That kind of conspiracy would be a little bit totally unprecedented in all of human history and impossible to initiate, much less maintain. But I concede the possibility.<p>If that's true for private enterprises, why is it not true for the government? If a politician can make me reliant on him forever, why won't he do it?<p><i>If they develop a one shot cure that is cheap, and an ongoing vaccine that people need once a year, obviously they'll hide the cheap cure, and get you to sign up for once a year medicine, because it'll make them more money.</i><p>If there's only one 'them' (as in the government example) that is true. If there are many 'thems', and a new 'them' can be started for fairly little money, one would expect someone who developed such a cure to market it independently. Yes, a multi-million dollar lump sum from curing everything is less than the billions of dollars in revenue generated by health care companies. But 100% of that lump sum is more than this researcher could expect from the companies.<p>On a startup-related discussion site, it's pretty foolish for you to argue that nobody will ever market the cheaper, better solution, and that we'll always be beholden to the big companies. Nobody here believes that about software -- do you?",1220997796

The rate of noise counts decreases with temperature - so you would expect the performance of a person at this task to improve as you cooled their body.<p>This was actually done for toads. The experimenter would train a toad to lash its tongue at faint flashes of light and the performance of the toad at discriminating light from no light was measured as the toad's body temperature was cooled.  As the toad was chilled the quality of its guesses improved.  Interestingly it's error rate as a function of temperature matched the change in signal to noise ratio for the currents in the retinal cells. Bizzare! The toad's brain controlled it's tongue at the threshold of being able to statistically distinguish signal from noise.",1220997705

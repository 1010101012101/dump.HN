You use it because the site is a giant infrastructure that is designed to pass the things you write along to other people, both through following and through replying. The actual system of posting messages is comparatively irrelevant: there were microblogging sites before Twitter, but they didn't focus on following other people, so they were forgotten.",1237380779

E.g. hack someones machine, store the data on their computer.

I overgeneralized.<p>The minute you standardize something and use it as a method of competition - be it GPA or SAT score or pretty much anything else where you accept people into something based on a number - you make that number meaningless. The presence of numbers means that people are suddenly able to hack the system, and that means that the numbers don't mean a thing at all. They are no longer indicative of good performance.",1237380613

The first is, the easiest way for a criminal to distance themself it must surely be to snoop some collegues password and log in on their computer after hours.<p>Secondly, in the old days, the KGB was the master of the 'honey trap': get some  clerical worker in a compromising position and then blackmail them into spying. Given that there are many more ordinary people than pedophiles, I would have thought that installing illegal data by virus and then blackmailing would be a lucrative sideline for these Russian 'businessmen' who originate it.  I'm a little surprised that you don't get many such viruses. The question is, have they not thought of it yet, does it not work for some reason, or are the viruses too clever at concealing themselves?",1237380398

IBM is trying to be a major player in the cloud computing space, but it relies on Xen and VMWare for x86 virtualization technology. IBM doesn't have much influence on Xen and its open source development community. Obviously IBM has even less influence over VMWare. So buying a solid x86 virtualization stack like VirtualBox would make IBM a serious contender for cloud computing deployments built from commodity x86 boxes.",1237380344

521543,comment,521307,521307,0,0,mdasen,,,"I guess the first thing I should take issue with is that the article isn't accurate: the iPhone is smaller than the Pre, not the other way around.  Maybe the author just looked at length and width and forgot that the Pre is significantly thicker leading it to be over one cubic inch larger in volume (while having less usable space for the screen).<p>Also, customers might have a love/hate relationship with AT&T, but AT&T posts the strongest net adds of any carrier - far outpacing even Verizon.  Sprint doesn't add customers, they loose them.  I'm a Sprint customer myself and don't quite understand why everyone hates Sprint, but they certainly do.  At the end of 2007, Sprint had 40.8M post-paid customers.  At the end of 2008, they had only 36.7M post-paid customers.  When one compares that to AT&T who added 7M customers (vs. losing 4.1M customers) over that same period, it's quite clear that one shouldn't be comparing them as both inspiring a similar feeling in customers.<p>I'm really looking forward to the Pre as a Sprint customer who won't leave for another carrier, but this article is trying to paint a much closer picture than is realistic.  The Pre is coming 2 years late with no applications (and only the widget-like HTML/JS that the iPhone 1.0 came with), a larger phone, on the worst performing network (in terms of customer adds).  What's the selling point for the Pre?  You hate Apple and want an iPhone?  You have a Sprint plan you can't leave because they've given you such a cheap deal (the situation I'm in)?<p>It's a wonderful looking device, but what's its superior position.  Other than the keyboard, I can't see it.  It's on a network people don't like as much, it doesn't have the ecosystem of add-ons (accessories and apps) that the iPhone has, and it's untested in the way that any first-gen thing is.  And all signs point that it will be just as expensive.<p>It may be war, but it looks like the Pre will be fighting with slingshots.<p>EDIT: I just want to be clear that I've had no problem with my Sprint service and am happy with it.  However, it's important to understand that objectively Sprint is not well liked by consumers and it's numbers are the worst of all the national carriers.",1237379647

High hopes that are dashed by the first failure are precisely what we don't need.""<p>As an extremely analytical person who wants to work on many hobbies (learning Spanish, salsa dancing, conversational dynamics, singing, etc. - pretty much everything that I'd like to be above average at and struggle at and continually shuffle among hobbies like the famous Chinese acrobat with spinning plates), this really touched me.<p>If I want to become better at something, I must accept poor results, especially in the beginning. I've managed to go from the awkward running out of moves/stepping on feet to actually enjoying dancing but that took a couple of years.<p>With Spanish, right now, I'm definitely handicapping myself as I simply am terrified to practice it outside of my understanding tutor who speaks slow-ly. I know that is holding me back (not attempting to make conversation) but I admit to myself that the now once-weekly tutoring session is an attempt to keep the 'learn Spanish' hobby on life support.<p>Ok I'm rambling but I had one of those maybe-a-deep personal insight this morning - I go to certain places/do certain things and more importantly avoid certain things - to preserve a day by day individual stat us quo.

IBM will probably stick with Power.<p>JAVA - might be good for it..  IBM are big supporters of java, with Eclipse, IBM JRE's, etc<p>MySQL - interesting dilemma - IBM have DB2 CE or whatever it's called as a free DB engine - mysql is not at DB2 level (yet) by any stretch - but if it's good enough  - then is it a revenue threat<p>Solaris - IBM have an awesome NIX variant in AIX.  Of course - that's why they now push Linux so much..  :P  Not sure what would happen to solaris here...<p>DTrace - obviously kept - maybe linux/aix porting?  (we can hope)<p>ZFS - again - you'd assume they would keep it.<p>Disk Storage - The thumper, etc seem like pretty good products..  IBM have some storage kit developed internally (DS8000 etc) - and some I believe is OEM..  I <i>think</i> that some gear like the Thumper might be able to replace the OEM gear...  (Would also be quite nice behind an SVC)<p>StorageTek  (Tape Drives) - These will need some consolidation (although again - some of IBM's kit is OEM) - but at the top end - I would have said that the SL8500 (Sun's) trumps the TS3500 (IBM's) at the high end - so that could be dramatic..<p>Intel/AMD based servers - I'd guess they'll keep them seperate for as long as they can - eventually standardising down to one of the two lines?  (Or perhaps spinning some/all out to Lenovo or someone like that?)<p>OpenOffice - since IBM are pushing it (or a badged variant of it) as Lotus Symphony - you'd assume it would be sticking around...<p>HPC - I can't see IBM dropped BlueGene - but I've got no clue what Sun are really doing in the space...  (from wiki: In 2006, Sun built the TSUBAME supercomputer, which was until June 2008 the fastest supercomputer in Asia. .... Ranger has a peak performance of over 500 TFLOPS, and is currently the 6th most powerful supercomputer on the TOP500 list (November 2008).)<p>And Wikipedia has a nice listing of all the goodness of sun hardware:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sun_Microsystems_hardware"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sun_Microsystems_hardw...</a>",1237378638

Depending on the grading of the images the CPS would then decide what to prosecute him with (i.e. all level 1's would probably get you a talking too and advice on places to get help if required, a decent number of level 5's would prompt prosecution).<p>I'd also look at how he organised them. For example if it was a few 100 MB's of borderline images (even if we know they are illegal) and they were spread randomly in his porn collection  then I would possibly consider it a negative. If then I found google searches for ""download lolita"" etc. and evidence of hanging out on 12chan et al then I might revise that view.<p>Each case varies considerably :) as I am sure you can imagine.<p>Currently possession of the material in large quantities is a crime.<p>What legal reason could there be for holding that quantity on disk? (bearing in mind the checks and paperwork we have to go through to hold the material per the requirments of our contracts).<p>That amount of data (10GB is a <i>lot</i>) would prompt me to look very closely at the sources and other activity as it would suggest distribution too (indeed I would be surprised if there were no distribution at that scale).<p>1 image wont get you jail time. 100 would depend on the context & the grading. 1000+ is, I hope, fairly obvious :)",1237377733

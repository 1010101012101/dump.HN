8091146,comment,8088431,8090927,1,0,csandreasen,,,"What Mark Klein revealed is the backbone for the case - the plaintiffs in Jewel v. NSA are claiming that they have standing because they are AT&T customers.  Here is their argument[1]:<p>&quot;First, the government unconstitutionally seizes plaintiffs’   Internet communications.  Technology at plaintiffs’ Internet service provider, AT&T, automatically creates and delivers to the government a  copy of plaintiffs’ online activities, along with  those of millions of other innocent Americans—including email, live chat, reading and interacting with websites, Internet searching, and social networking.<p>Second, the government unconstitutionally searches the content   of much of the communications stream it has seized.  The  government admits that it searches the content of the online  communications that it has seized if it believes there is some  indication that the origin or destination of the communication is outside the United States.&quot;<p>As I scroll through the statement of facts, I see Mark Klein&#x27;s testimony, the PCLOB 702 report and Barton Gellman&#x27;s article from earlier this month cited.  Klein&#x27;s testimony is key to this case because that&#x27;s how the EFF is establishing that the plaintiffs have standing.<p>> The NSA is not capturing only traffic between Russia and Venezuela or only traffic that crosses a national border.<p>The EFF itself is saying right in their article and court filing[2] that the NSA is discarding purely domestic traffic.<p>> They are sitting on the links into Google&#x27;s data centers. Google is a domestic entity. So either they&#x27;re sitting on a link and then filtering out 100% of the traffic (which is preposterous) or they&#x27;re sitting on a link where 100% of the traffic goes to and from a domestic entity and not filtering it out.<p>There is absolutely no evidence of this.  I assume you&#x27;re making a reference to the Barton Gellman&#x27;s MUSCULAR reporting[3], which claimed that the NSA was making use of GCHQ&#x27;s tapping of international fiber to scan Google&#x27;s unencrypted international communications for their targets.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/document/plaintiffs-jewel-knutzen-and-waltons-motion-partial-summary-judgment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/document/plaintiffs-jewel-knutzen-and-wa...</a> (see page 7)<p>[2] Same as above, page 10<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04...</a>",1406415540

Explicit goals I have in common include:<p>- Focus on the lispy parts of sh - prefix functions everywhere and a simple, regular syntax.  Not that anything with FD redirections as a primitive can get anywhere near S-expressions&#x27; simplicity, but shell is naturally more regular than most programming languages (even if bash goes out of its way to be complex).<p>- Be a real programming language that doesn&#x27;t make you reach for awk or perl (separate, incompatible environments) to do moderately complex things sanely.<p>- Emphasize using pipelines rather than &#x27;backwards&#x27; function application to naturally string together operations.<p>- Emphasize lambdas.<p>- Typed (i.e. non-string) pipes.<p>- Syntax highlighting.<p>- Nonzero-exit modeled as exceptions.  (I think elvish is doing this, but I haven&#x27;t reviewed the code in detail.)<p>Things I want but don&#x27;t see in the readme include:<p>- A story for passing typed data around between processes (potentially in different languages) rather than just builtins.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the story should be, but it should exist.<p>- A somewhat more succinct \nsyntax, with metaprogramming kept in mind.<p>- A JIT, eventually.<p>There seems to be a lot more in the first category than the second... give up?

That sets it at elite, rather than mass-market. The problem with elite is outside of SFO and NYC, you&#x27;ll get a lot less viral word-of-mouth growth. In most of the world, elites do talk to each other, but they talk to non-elites a lot more, and when they do talk to elites, the topic is usually not clothing.<p>To give a concrete example: I am C-level. As such, I could afford it, but most people I know would not be able to. The only people I could mention it to would be VP-level or C-level, most of whom are colleagues rather than friends. This would limit word-of-mouth from someone like me to perhaps 2-3 people tops, rather than 20-30 (so in practice, 0 rather than 2-3, since it would come up in conversation for perhaps 10% of the people I know). At $69, I also won&#x27;t buy it on a whim. At a price point competitive with Eddie Bauer, or even Men&#x27;s Warehouse, I would, just to see how well it worked. If it worked well, I&#x27;d switch to it. If I did buy it, at $69, I also expect quality. I wouldn&#x27;t buy a second one until I see how long the first one lasts. That means repeat business won&#x27;t come until you probably run out of runway.<p>Custom-tailored pants, in India or Africa, cost $10 for the fabric and $3 for the labor (and are fantastic). Even with a generous mark-up, you ought to be able to have a slow but inexpensive process that competes with middle class mass-market goods (not Walmart and Target, but certainly EB and Men&#x27;s Warehouse).",1406415493

In the post I&#x27;m responding to, you started with the assumption that bitcoin is good, and then reasoned from that assumption that we should use bitcoin in specific circumstances while <i>ignoring arguments that it&#x27;s not the best technology for addressing those specific problems</i>.<p>But this reasoning is really silly. Because then every time I point out there&#x27;s a better technology for solving problem X, you say &quot;yeah, but Bitcoin solves lots of problems! So if we use it as the solution for X, then there&#x27;s more adoption and we solve all these other problems.&quot;<p>But of course the only &quot;other problems&quot; you&#x27;ve mentioned <i>all</i> have better alternatives.

It&#x27;s just snark as you say.<p>There was incredible demand for something like Java,  gigantic efforts were put in to place to standardize the many different UNIX like OSes but apps were still incompatible.  ANDF was an effort by the OpenGroup,  I&#x27;m not aware of any real implementations of it.  The big powers, save for MS, all wanted to build platforms where vendors could write applications that could run.  Then along comes Java, it has all the modern bits in a language that people deemed needed at the time, there were plans for performance,  it was fairly easy to implement a VM, it had a robust library, C-inspired syntax (Pascal vs C might have been the last big war before Java,) it had real binary compatibility.  Sun, IBM, Oracle, just about every major company backed it, even MS sort of did.   The performance got better, etc..  When the whole industry buys in to something, it&#x27;d have been amazing if it didn&#x27;t get adopted.  Then compared to C++ or C,  the productivity gains were (and still are) staggering,  GC and real stack traces are manna from the gods at the time.<p>Fast-forward to now,  it&#x27;s still got top shelf managed language performance,  the tooling is maybe only matched by MS&#x27;s tools.  The counter question I&#x27;d ask, what has come up lately that could possibly replace Java?   There are some interesting JVM languages,  the CS dork in me would love for Scala to take off more but not for any qualitative reason that I could point to to say it&#x27;s really better; I&#x27;m a functional believer but I&#x27;d estimate that less than 3% of the code written in any language anywhere is functional.   Rust and Go are neat, but if you look at the whole picture, I don&#x27;t think there is anything close to providing what Java does that would justify replacing it; save for possibly .net but then you lose the compatibility which was one of the primary desires from the start.   I&#x27;d think something would have to outdo java or the game would have to change pretty dramatically and enterprises would start needing different kinds of software and I don&#x27;t see that happening any time soon.<p>How many major technologies get replaced with nothing?",1406415425

We used to license libraries to provide basic things like lists, hashtables, string handling. Compiling things to work on multiple platforms was a nightmare, especially Windows. Developing on Windows and deploying on Unix was a pipedream. Java just swept all of this away and replaced it with a standard portable runtime that worked across Windows and Unix was free. The equivalents that offered these things (say, Perl) were not considered viable contenders at the time (dynamic languages in general did not gain a lot of trust until Ruby on Rails and PHP became so widely used - people just did not believe that you could build a large scale system with such languages and not have all fall apart if the type system wasn&#x27;t rigorously checked).",1406414904

Road building has a coercive effect in that many of its costs are born by everyone, and there is no way to opt out of those costs if you live in the city.  Everything is more diffuse and less pedestrian friendly and moving about the city is more expensive.  If you opt out of car ownership, you bear the expenses without enjoying the dividends.  People who can&#x27;t afford to drive suffer a sort of regressive tax.  They do not drive but nevertheless live in a sprawling city built for cars with dangerous roads, ungainly parking lots, sprawling commercial districts, and inadequate public transportation.<p>Roads are terrific for creating distance to separate rich from poor.  Those with means can hunker down in their gated community in the suburbs with a spacious private back yard and drive their air conditioned SUV to the parking garage downtown without even suffering a whiff of the common people on the street.<p>Walkways and public transportation democratize the city.  Everyone enjoys the fruit of public investment, and everyone rubs shoulders on the subway or railcar.  Common areas create a public forum where an inclusive community can form. The streets and sidewalks and alleys are used by everyone, not just those who cannot afford to drive past them. So it is in everyone&#x27;s interest to make the city streets a safe and healthy place to be.",1406414246

But the proliferation of cell phones, and their concomitant ability to record and distribute data is making it possible for individuals and small groups to do things like this rain forest project. One of the things I predict will happen is that at some point a big push will be made to prevent people from randomly disposing of their old phones, instead either rewarding them monetarily or requiring their disposal in an &#x27;approved&#x27; way. At the recent visit to the equipment liquidator I sometimes buy from I saw a pallet with a box full of phones. All kinds from Nokia candybar phones to blackberries to off brand android phones. There had to be 2500 to 3000 phones in the box. I doubt they sold for more than breakage (0.03/lb). But a motivated individual could &#x27;fix&#x27; that like this guy did. Buy them attach a solar power + battery source and cheap sim cards and doing nothing more than the phone was designed to do (record sound or take a picture, send an MMS message) Lots of interesting intelligence over a wide area could be acquired. Want to know who the drug dealers are in a neighborhood? Or who works during the day? Or which houses have nobody in them? You could do a lot taking 10 snapshots a day and sending them to a central server.<p>Clearly it&#x27;s anathema to a control state to have that ability in the hands of someone outside their control, so I predict some mobilization against it, from the phone &quot;trade in&quot; that is too good to be true to new rules and regulations about running an unattended computing device with recording capabilities.",1406412801

The author calls the extremely narrow streets &quot;intimate&quot; and they are in many cases, but they can also be claustrophobic (especially if you live in them).<p>For housing, not everyone will want to live in streets as narrow as the pictures in the blog post. Who doesn&#x27;t prefer long views out of their window? (Preferably of some greenery) That doesn&#x27;t mean building huge spaces between houses as is often the case in modern car suburbs. But there needs to be enough distance to psychologically feel you have a sense of privacy from your neighbours.<p>Here is a random Victorian street (in a very expensive part of London) that I think has a good scale. The road is not too wide. Cars are parked on the street rather than in garages. The houses are of fairly high density. This is a better template for housing than modern car susburbs in my view. But it won&#x27;t be for everyone.<p><a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.556208,-0.165162,3a,75y,36.4h,95.29t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s7s8c8K1PkJB5p_w2cTWCYA!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.556208,-0.165162,3a,75y,36...</a>",1406412080

8090957,comment,8090580,8090580,4,0,taylodl,,,"IBM adopted Java early on as a client side development technology to be used in client/server computing that was so prevalent in the 90s. IBM also had a lot of their customers rebuilding 20-30 year old applications in Java to address Y2K issues. IBM supports Java running on their zSeries and pSeries systems. IBM supports Java applications using JMS over MQSeries to interoperate with legacy applications and supports Java accessing DB2 databases. IBM even has tools to allow COBOL copybooks to be exposed as web services, which Java can then easily consume. There&#x27;s still a ton of legacy COBOL applications and thanks to IBM, Java can interoperate with that legacy code and extend its functionality.<p>And it&#x27;s not all about IBM either. Obviously Oracle, another enterprise favorite, is playing in the Java space these days and provide an application server, WebLogic, along with great support for accessing Oracle&#x27;s RDBMs from Java. Oracle also has several industry vertical solutions all based on Java.<p>Finally there&#x27;s Red Hat. Lots of enterprises run RHEL when running a Linux server and their JBoss application server is highly regarded.<p>Java then offers enterprises a lot of flexibility. There&#x27;s multiple vendors from which they can choose to procure application servers, there&#x27;s little risk of platform lock-in, they can fully interoperate with legacy applications and there&#x27;s a ton of reasonable cost developers available - who are mostly happy with a language that&#x27;s fairly modern. There&#x27;s actually quite a bit for an enterprise to like about Java.",1406412005

7637189,comment,7635107,7636376,1,0,chestnut-tree,,,"In the UK, most TV subscription services that sell you a &quot;package&quot; of channels have long-term contracts (12 months is usually the minimum). They try and sweeten this by providing you with a &quot;free&quot; digital video recorder (not really free) and often combine TV, phone and broadband services into one subscription package.<p>Streaming-based services such as Amazon, Netflix and Blinkbox (owned by supermarket giant Tesco) let you subscribe on a month-to-month basis or film-by-film basis. These services feel more flexible because they&#x27;re not trying to sell you a whole bunch of channels, some of which you may not have much interest in.<p>Interestingly, even the BBC can see where the market is heading for many viewers. Their &quot;youth&quot; channel BBC Three (aimed at 16-34 year olds) will stop broadcasting terrestially and become an online-only channel via their iPlayer service. I guess this reflects how more and more people consume content today - they don&#x27;t consult a TV schedule, they expect to be able to view content when it suits them.",1398290347

7637174,comment,7636675,7636675,4,0,bertil,,,"I have reasons to believe that Facebook earnings correspond to unstable practice: namely, both brands and games have bad metrics (i.e. uninformative) of their activity, and both are re-considering how their price fan- and user-acquisition. There is a stunning lack of understanding of social network dynamics among Facebook client companies. I have been through a lot of interviews lately, and no one to whom I talked seemed to know basic things like the Friend paradox, avalanche thresholds, or that the first fans are naturally more engaged -- Facebook ad purchase interface doesn’t really help either.<p>Nothing about game session duration, rhythm? Nothing about the thousands of odd Pakistani accounts liking the page of random family restaurants in the North of Ireland?<p>Some people at Facebook know those very well, but as far as I can tell, no one has connected that issue with a Wil-E-Coyote moment: strong sales out of momentum, filling an inflated inventory but widespread skepticism. There is indeed far more ads in the Facebook mobile thread, but almost exclusively for miss-targeted offers (I recently moved to a different country, twice, and I keep seeing things for local apps in a city 2,400 miles away) and for mobile games with Zynga-like gameplay: pay or… well, you can pay too.<p>I’m not sure Facebook is aware of that; I am sure however that Zynga wasn’t, or at least that the people in charge of the financial stability of the company dealt with that issue in an unethical manner. Seeing both a trend and someone to chosen to reinforce it scares me.",1398290204

And it is a manual process.<p>So every Monday morning I get a file with payments. I have to move that amount over to Balanced. This can take 3 to 5 business days, but almost always takes 5 or even 6. Meaning I cannot pay my customers until the Friday (5 days) or the Monday (8 days) later.<p>Also, Balanced cannot process ACH for payments from clients. Having to verify an account with micro deposits is simply not workable for our clientele, many of which do not want to take credit cards because of the high fees.<p>While our volume right now is too low, it is interesting info to have, and something I&#x27;ll look into further.<p>Thanks!",1398290203

At least for personal investments, IIRC you get some sort of foreign tax credit.<p>Any money Apple pays to foreign governments as income tax on profits is included in the calculation of their domestic tax liability. So if Apple had $1B in overseas profits, paid 5% in Ireland as income tax, then wanted to repatriate the remainder to the US, the government would seek $300M in tax -- not the $350M that would be indicated by our 35% corporate income tax rate.<p>People trotting out the &#x27;double-taxation&#x27; nonsense are promoting the idea that Apple should be able to venue-shop for an ultra-low-tax locale to claim their profits, then be free-and-clear of their US obligations.<p>Two more things worth mentioning:<p>1.  The &#x27;overseas&#x27; money typically isn&#x27;t physically overseas. The money is in US banks, circulating as loans in the US economy, but is only overseas on an accounting ledger for tax purposes. This greatly blunts the potential impact of tax holidays.<p>2.  If Apple takes out debt to fund operations purely to avoid repatriating money, the US taxpayer would then be subsidizing Apple even further.  Interest on debt is a deductible expense, so that 2.5% per year Apple is paying, would be deducted from their income in the next tax year.",1398290126

I never lasted more than a year or two in any job.<p>For the last 14 years I&#x27;ve been running my own business, which is a lot better (more interesting work, less stress, etc.) However I will admit that I got quite lucky in building a niche product that people wanted to pay money for.<p>If I had to get a &#x27;proper&#x27; job again, I think I would be in the same position as you - there just aren&#x27;t that many interesting and fulfilling software jobs out there. I would probably consider doing something completely different, like driving taxis, being a commercial pilot, or manual labour.<p>If you&#x27;re in a full-time job, consider doing contracting. Depending on what country you live in, it can be very lucrative and easy to find short-term work. The UK has lots of opportunities, Canada and the US less so. Unfortunately most of the work is pretty boring, but at least you only have to do it for a while before moving on.<p>Also consider taking a lower salary but working in a more fulfilling environment.

The trouble is, in a case like this where the devs/admins were clearly at fault, good customer service should trump that.

Your dividend check will remain the same (assuming an equal percentage the next time a dividend is announced). You&#x27;ll own more shares, but each individual share will be worth less (but again, the <i>total</i> worth of your AAPL stake will remain the same).<p>Will it go up or down? (EDIT: apparently &quot;up&quot; if afterhours is any indication.) Used to be, back in the dotBomb days, a split announcement drove the price up. Now remember from above that nothing has really changed. AAPL&#x27;s market cap is still the same, there&#x27;s just more shares out there. One thing that has changed is that Joe Sixpack doesn&#x27;t need to drop $50K to buy a lot of 100 shares. But Joe doesn&#x27;t drive the market, institutional investors do. And when Fidelity&#x27;s mutual fund is buying $10,000,000 worth of AAPL, they don&#x27;t care if the share price is $1 or $1000. So there isn&#x27;t much rational reason for the price to go one way or another.<p>A split could be taken as &quot;management thinks...&quot;. I don&#x27;t know, could have some weight to it, could not. At the end of the day, as someone who has traded stocks for over 15 years and traded AAPL since about 2003 (yea, me! Mostly...), I&#x27;m not making any decisions one way or the other on this news. I&#x27;ll keep an eye on AAPL for sure, though, just in case the market disagrees with me.<p>Would now be a good time to buy? No, <i>yesterday</i> was a good time to buy (that&#x27;s okay, I didn&#x27;t either) because it&#x27;s up 8% in afterhours. Earnings are tomorrow, and never ever never buy AAPL the day before earnings (it almost always go down the next day). WWDC is coming up, so it could be &quot;AAPL announcement means they&#x27;ll soon own the $WHATEVER market. Buy!&quot; or it could be &quot;AAPL announcement shows that a post-Jobs Apple is doomed. Doomed!&quot;<p>No offense, but if you have to have a stock split explained to you then you&#x27;re probably not suited to trying to time the market on AAPL. Hell, I&#x27;ve been trading AAPL for over ten years, and I&#x27;m not suited to trying to time it (I&#x27;ve done it, and mostly come out ahead, but I attribute it to getting lucky and not to my 133t trading skillz). Just hang on to it, see how it shakes out, and if it hits a good price for you at some point, sell it. Or if it takes a dip (say, after earnings maybe?), buy some more. If it opens up 8% tomorrow morning, you might even consider <i>selling</i> what you&#x27;ve got. Then if it dips after earnings, buy some more then.<p>But I am in no way, shape, or form a financial adviser. My advice isn&#x27;t even worth what you paid for it. For entertainment purposes only, do not under any circumstances make trades based on what some anonymous dumbass on the internet says, because we&#x27;re a dime a dozen, and if I were so smart I&#x27;d be hiking the Cascades today and not working a day job.",1398289698

7637111,comment,7636066,7636444,5,0,pjg,,,"Maybe. Here&#x27;s a slightly different perspective. First take the case of ftp&#x27;ing/sftp&#x27;ing files to a bank.<p>There are multiple layers of security in sftp - not just the username and password. Source IP is checkec in a stateful way so spoofing is hard even if one somehow manages to get the credentials. Furthermore the files will not be processed unless there is an <i>out-of-band</i> message (typically an email, could be a phone call too ) with certain info also required in very specific format which must match the contents of the file. So there you go. 3 layers of security with one layer being completely out-of-band with the other two  is reasonable enough for the risk involved. (There are other measures hard coded e.g. a dollar limit which basically &quot;cap&quot; any fraud but I won&#x27;t go into those)<p>Now for the missing (or atleast MIA)  transaction you allude  to on your blog: Just because <i>you</i> were not told how the money ended up where it did doesn&#x27;t mean people didn&#x27;t know. Bankers are steeped in &quot;social engineering&quot; and trained from day one to only give out information required by law and really nothing else.\nWhether you use Fedwire or Swift (or really any other RTGS = real-time gross settlement network ) there is always a trail. Always. In your case it was probably Fedwire - and the bank I&#x27;m guessing was BofA or maybe Chase. Regardless if the sender&#x27;s account is an individual account (not business) they are still protected by Reg E (as well as FDIC insurance). Reg E as you may know basically puts the onus of returning the funds to the sender&#x27;s account on the bank. The problem is the timelines or the lack of it. Since banks are generally allowed upto 30 days (I don&#x27;t know if 30 days is hardcoded ) in law they take their sweet time in tracing. And when they find out - they almost always do - they deliberately will not share details with you to protect themselves from liability.<p>The bottom line is ACH/FedWire moves trillions of dollars - hundreds of billions a day - and barring a very small percentage they all work.",1398289425

Let me try to better explain myself:<p>There is a form of survival of the fittest taking place; new languages need frameworks for people to operate within. Those frameworks spring up, some work many some don&#x27;t. You consolidate some into one, and then you build that out. It has won. Within it you have aspects that you want to change, so you contribute an alternative, to make those succeed you have to build clean interfaces. Once you reach this point you have a real framework: i.e. something opinionated about the relationship between varied modules.<p>Rails is, imho, the best example of this - it has had millions of hours of code contributed to it by the OSS world. It has reached maturity to the point where people wish to make it behave differently. They can do this because of that maturity.<p>When I see things like Goji, my frustrations are not at goji (again, I poorly expressed that in my initial statement - sorry) but rather at the fact that the initial ramp up period as described above is so inefficient. If you consolidate into one sooner then you&#x27;re in a really good spot. From my POV golang already has a great micro-framework for web services - so why not invest the time in making that better? For example the graceful http server termination aspect (where goji shuts the listen socket down but services the remaining connections), why not contribute that? Why contribute routing?<p>RE: security. Recently I came across a piece that delved into the depths of why websites are insecure. The author made the compelling case that a great number of reasons for this is that most engineers do not understand web security, and in some ways that is down to the spread in frameworks - some handle security as a first class concern, others do not.

That&#x27;s not a safe way for interpolation to work, because then random strings from unsafe sources can start including any variables from your environment. String interpolation should only apply to string literals. What you actually want (no idea if it&#x27;s available in Go) is something akin to Sprintf but with named instead of positional arguments, and then explicitly provide a map of those arguments rather than letting it get them from the lexical environment as interpolation does.",1398286980

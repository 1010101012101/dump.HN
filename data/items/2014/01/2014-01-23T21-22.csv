That means that you can use `+` the same way on ints, floats, matrices, and your own self-defined numeric type. If `x` is a variable of your new numeric type, OO languages make making `x + 5` work easy, but `5 + x` super hard. Multiple dispatch makes both cases (equally) easy. This was, as I understand it, the major reason that Julia uses multiple dispatch.<p>Multiple dispatch can make interfaces simpler: you can easily offer several &quot;versions&quot; of a function by changing which arguments they take, and you can define those functions where it makes sense, even if those places are spread across multiple modules or packages. Julia provides great tools (functions) that make methods discoverable, help you understand which method you&#x27;re calling, and help you find the definition of methods.<p>Looking at some Julia code (the base library or major packages) might give you a better idea of how Julia uses multiple dispatch.",1390512905

They are only means to an end, which is user experience. Sure, some car buyers may know or care what alloy their cylinder block is made of, but a lot don&#x27;t know, and don&#x27;t care, how many cylinders there are. They only care (somewhat) about how it drives. And it is certainly possible to have a language with all the theoretically nice features, but offering horrible user experience for a specific purpose. Part of it is just marketing, but part of it is also optimization with a different purpose in mind.<p>For example, his purpose, and Julia&#x27;s main use case, is often different from that of either a language designer or a software engineer: e.g. performance and fast prototyping are first order concerns (together with a decent scientific library), and everything else, like longevity, ability of future code reuse, or simplifying work of teams are way, way down the list. The reason of course is that ~90% of code is written by one person, for himself, to effectively run once and produce one paper, and to be never touched by anyone ever again. At least, this is what I see in my field, which is largely dominated by Matlab (and Matlab-like syntax is definitely a <i>huge</i> asset here).",1390512344

Usually I&#x27;ve thought of this in the context of programming in general and trying to contain bugs against the overwhelming forces of chaos pressing in on us as we try to build systems of millions, billions, or trillions of bits; as programmers, we are exposed to some fairly raw mathematical chaos, in the &quot;chaos theory&quot; sense of the term, and in particular, the difficulty of fully predicting what a chaotic system will do in response to some stimulus. A great deal of software engineering is a desperate attempt to wall it away from ourselves and confine our intrinsically wild and wooly systems to just the behaviors that fit in our heads... but alas, we fight against a crafty foe that can find even one bit&#x27;s worth of weakness and bring millions of dollars worth of systems down around our heads.<p>And that&#x27;s <i>before</i> we consider human attackers.<p>One bit flipped can be the difference between an attacker walking off with the entire contents of your billing database, or getting a simple rejected request. One click can start a cascade of trillions of instructions terminating in your amazing computer becoming a spam delivery device that belongs to a guy 15,000 miles away. Every computer program stands balanced precisely on a small, small knife edge, with an n-dimensional abyss waiting on all sides to consume it, and hostile, intelligent forces anxious to give it a small, carefully calculated tip into their bit of it.<p>That probably doesn&#x27;t work for the essay you&#x27;re looking to write; my metaphor comes more from the software engineering side.

Plus:<p>* In a high-profile incident, outside professionals will often need to come in, first because insurance and contracts require a full investigation, and second because once a site is compromised you have to assume there are backdoors that will restore access for the attackers in the future. The cost of an external forensics investigation can hit mid-5-figures by itself very easily. Plus:<p>* A high-profile incident is inevitably going to involve legal fees for the victim.<p>That&#x27;s before you get into things like reputation damage, loss of clients/customers/advertisers, &c.<p>Like I said upthread, $10k-$20k damages for the defacement of one of the largest newspaper websites in the world sounds like a very low figure to me. I don&#x27;t mean that in a normative sense. I mean, in the positive, descriptive sense, that sounds like less than what these incidents usually actually cost to their victims.",1390511997

7111255,comment,7109982,7111056,6,0,simonster,,,"> Another example is the byte addressing of UTF-8 strings, which may give an error if you try to index strings in the middle of a UTF-8 sequence [1]. s = &quot;\\u2200 x \\u2203 y&quot;; s[2] is an error, instead of returning the second character of the string. I find this a little awkward.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s a little awkward, but to understand why this tradeoff was made, think about how you&#x27;d get the nth character in a UTF-8 string. There is a tradeoff between intuitive O(n) string indexing by characters and O(1) string indexing by bytes.<p>The way out that some programming languages have chosen is to store your strings as UTF-16, and use O(1) indexing by two-byte sequence. That&#x27;s not a great solution, because 1) it takes twice as much memory to store an ASCII string and 2) if someone gives you a string that contains a Unicode character that can&#x27;t be expressed in UCS-2, like \U0001F423, your code will either be unable to handle it at all or do the wrong thing, and you are unlikely to know that until it happens.<p>The other way out is to store all of your strings as UTF-32/UCS-4. I&#x27;m not sure any programming language does this, because using 4x as much memory for ASCII strings and making string manipulation significantly slower as a result (particularly for medium-sized strings that would have fit in L1 cache as UTF-8 but can&#x27;t as UCS-4) is not really a great design decision.<p>Instead of O(n) string indexing by characters, Julia has fast string indexing by bytes with chr2ind and nextind functions to get byte indexes by character index, and iterating over strings gives 4-byte characters. Is this the appropriate tradeoff? That depends on your taste. But I don&#x27;t think that additional computer science knowledge would have made this problem any easier.",1390511744

In Kenya, for example, we use the M-PESA mobile money service to electronically transfer cash into the mobile phone account of each person.  M-PESA has an online interface, so we can do this transfer entirely online.  Our first loans back in 2009 were disbursed to Masai nomad communities located over a day&#x27;s journey from any paved road or electricity.  It was an amazing experience to send cash electronically from our US bank account to the mobile phones of people in such a remote place, which had been unreachable even by local banks in Kenya. Recent innovations such as mobile phone-based payments are what make a platform like Zidisha feasible.<p>To address your second question, yes, 100% of lender funds go directly to the entrepreneur that you fund.  (We accept optional tips from lenders, and borrowers also pay a 5% service fee for the loans to cover our operating costs.)<p>It is true that it is incredibly expensive and time-consuming in most developing countries to register a formal business with the government.  Most of the entrepreneurs fundraising at Zidisha are in the &quot;informal sector&quot; - though they do very often employ others as a result of the loans.<p>Zidisha does not provide any kind of business or other training services.  We are purely platform for direct P2P interaction, closer to eBay than to the Grameen Bank.",1390511481

Won&#x27;t you wish your code was maintainable so you could change it to be faster?<p>From my experience, this isn&#x27;t the case at all. A lot of the time my first attempt is in Python. The first attempt is really more of a prototype or a proof of concept. If the code works and I want to productize it, the code needs to be sped up. I have (at least) 2 choices: (1) make the Python code as fast as possible or (2) rewrite the whole thing in C/CUDA. If I take option 1, performance gains will be marginal and I still probably won&#x27;t be happy with the performance of the software. Option 2 might take a bit longer, but at least I&#x27;ll get something performant out. As I&#x27;m just throwing out and rewriting the first attempt, I don&#x27;t actually care at all if it was maintainable code. I don&#x27;t even care if the ideas in it were well explained/commented, because they&#x27;re all my ideas and they&#x27;re still fresh in my mind and I&#x27;m just going to rewrite the code and then document/clean up the fast version.<p>The appeal of Julia is that I no longer have to do this rewrite to make my code fast.

For example an &quot;all you can eat&quot; buffet means all you can eat in one visit and also means you can&#x27;t expect to take home what you don&#x27;t eat. Likewise unlimited would typically come with some restrictions and expectation that you aren&#x27;t watching movies 24x7 but more like a normal person might (call it 12 hours x 30 days?).<p>&quot;So instead of advertising as &quot;unlimited&quot;, why not say &quot;Use as much as you want upto xyz GB&quot;. &quot;<p>Well for one thing most end users wouldn&#x27;t have an idea of what that means.

Now, the Emacs ansi-term is also not perfect, but way better than Conqueterm.<p>Org mode is a very sophisticated Todo and documentation and wiki and calendar and management and literal programming system for Emacs. I haven&#x27;t found anything that compares to it. It is really really good.<p>The java doc thing is something entirely different, and that&#x27;s usually made possible by the various language modes.",1390510884

If you have someone&#x27;s contact information and you have some reason to believe they&#x27;ll be interested in your service, that&#x27;s a lead.<p>Without a referral or lead, if you&#x27;re cold calling, you&#x27;re calling someone who not only hasn&#x27;t inquired about your service, but whom you have no reason to believe wants to hear from you. In my opinion, you have no place calling that person. If you choose to do so anyway, it&#x27;s your responsibility to waste as little of their time as possible in as cordial a manner as you can. Hard sells are absolutely awful.<p>I only get upset with cold callers that don&#x27;t quit the first time I say no. No matter how qualified you believe a lead is or how it&#x27;s been validated/verified, if the person on the other end says no, don&#x27;t push it. Maybe they&#x27;ll just keep saying no, but maybe they&#x27;ll remember you as the pushy jerk whose product/service they&#x27;ll now never consider.",1390510875

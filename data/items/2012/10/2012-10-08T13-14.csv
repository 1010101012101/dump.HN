I mean, I can't imagine someone on the job struggling with code, but only being able to look at a printout of it rather than in an ide/debugger, unable to look at a book, the internet, or ask someone for advice, and having a strict 30 minute or so time limit to figure out their problem.",1349704785

Also look at the Gambit-C implementation of Scheme, which compiles to C.  The C itself is arranged like a VM, it's very fast (biggest issue with this approach is incremental compiling, where you need trampolines; the more code you block compile the more you can avoid this overhead).",1349704766

One person made the suggestion that the reason why a lot of companies ask more...bookish knowledge that seems like its from college homework/final exam, is that they don't want to admit that what they do is relatively mundane, and doesn't really require the daily application of the kind of thing you find on your data structures or operating systems final exam. So, they add complexity to their interview questions, as well as their development process, to compensate.<p>Does anyone know if traditional, ""real"" engineering fields, (civil, chemical, mechanical, etc) ask detailed, technical kinds of questions during interviews, like software engineering is known for? I find it hard to believe civil engineers get bombarded with all day grill fests by other civil engineers about technical questions in interviews, but I really don't know.",1349704658

Seriously?<p>If you genuinely think so, then we can end the discussion right here, as if that is the case, we are arguing on an entirely different basis.<p>Just to be clear, my argument is based on my expectation of engaging in a discussion that is not particularly scientific, but is a casual debate about a scientific result where most of the participants are not scientists, nor have sufficient knowledge or interest in the field in question to have read much actual research in the field. That fits _my_ observation of this debate. I see little to no evidence that there's much ""science"" going on in this debate.<p>> Yes, understood. But not for a scientist.<p>This is blatantly false. Scientists frequently engage in discussions about fields they only have a superficial interest in too, and where they don't have the time nor the interest to probe deeper, and I have personally seen plenty of examples of scientists deferring to authority on subjects they do not personally know for all kinds of purposes. Yes, that is not ""science"". But we're not all engaging in science every moment of our waking lives.<p>> So, because you won't do research, someone has to prove themselves to you?<p>No. Because I am here reading about something I don't have sufficient interest in to research, I appreciate an indicator of authority as a a contributing factor to judge what degree of trust to assign certain claims.<p>We all do that pretty much constantly, and largely automatically. Your username, for example, means I assign you a certain amount of trust in matters I have reason to believe you know something about. E.g. if you were to make statements about AppleWrite in conversation on HN, I'd likely take it on trust. Does that mean I'd be unwilling to do research about it in certain cases?<p>Of course not. If I was writing a scholarly article about the history of word processing, for example, of course I would obtain multiple sources and track down other evidence.<p>But I am not here conducting science, neither I'd gather are the vast majority of other people here. And then trust and authority <i>does</i> matter as shortcuts. I have plenty of other things to spend my time on. Things I _care_ about, which is not something I can say about neuroscience.<p>> Jim Jones' followers died because they were unwilling to think for themselves, do their own research.<p>Did you <i>seriously</i> compare someone asking for indicators of authority from someone who made statements that appeared to be a bit controversial to not being willing to think for oneself before joining a religious cult and participating in mass suicide? Are you for real?<p>Deferring to authority and assigning trust are not inherently bad just because there are nasty examples of the consequences of taking it too far.<p>For someone who harp about science, you've made some quite astounding leaps of logic.<p>> That's not a scientific example, because doctors aren't scientists.<p>Irrelevant. The issue here is not science, but whether trust and authority have value in determining whether or not it is necessary to do your own basic research of everything.<p>> The bottom line in science, and in any scientific discussion, is that authority and expertise are never important. The greatest amount of scientific eminence is trumped by the smallest amount of scientific evidence.<p>If this was a ""scientific discussion"" perhaps you'd have a point.<p>The reality is that in a casual discussion, - which is what this is to me, and clearly to a substantial number of the other participants, given the widespread lack of citations and evidence in this discussion - where a large number of the participants are either not scientists and/or not deeply familiar with the subject in question, nor invested enough to find it worthwhile to chase down source material, often it is not clear what the evidence - if presented - actually is and what it actually means to a lay person.<p>As such, authority and expertise is an important shortcut to get an overview for the purpose of the discussion without bogging the discussion down to the point where the participants lose interest.<p>> I'm beginning to realize you can't distinguish between science and anecdote. As they say, the plural of anecdote is not evidence.<p>I'm beginning to realize that you don't understand that in a social conversation, rather than, say, a scientific conference, evidence is not paramount, and often isn't even that important. That's not to say that some relevant evidence and citations are not appreciated, but most of us will not read them. That's not why people participate in these discussions. If we wanted in depth neuro-science, for example, we'd be busy reading the research not discussing a press-release on HN.",1349704005

Not to mention experiencing it in a new medium (heh, play-by-mail) and taking it to another scale. Hell, our alliance has it's own custom authentication application that strings together dozens of various applications that serve our coalition. We have a small team of system admins that run our services. A single jabber broadcast for a fleet reaches thousands of members instantly, followed by a flurry on logins to the game server.<p>As far as the ""initial experience"" being terrible, I completely agree with you on that one.

You're right, it's a simulator of something, but when you are in a science fiction setting where spaceship pilots are immortal, it's never going to represent any war we are familiar with. You're wrong about it not being interesting though, if it wasn't interesting, thousands of us wouldn't log in at one time to take part in a battle over a bunch of pixels.<p>In regard to your comment about it not being sold as a ""social experiment"", you'd be surprised.

I agree most app UIs are awful and none are consistent with other apps.<p>One point not mentioned is the Meta issues.  I've got one main screen 4x4 icons and 5 total screens and I do a heck of a lot more with my phone than read one site's news.  I do not have the screen space for an app for every website I've ever visited plus all the base load of apps (runkeeper, doggcatcher, kindle app, a dozen or so others).  So a ""bookmark"" app needs to be important enough for me to delete another app or spend a long time scrolling the list to find it.  The browser, on the other hand, is always and easily available.<p>The other issue is I have limited memory on my phone.  Some people do not.  But for some of us, its a constant battle to remove stuff.  To install ""really big app thats basically a incredibly bloated bookmark"" I need to delete something else.  Will it be runkeeper?  Will it be doggcatcher?  Don't think so.<p>Finally some apps have a smell about them.  Go to ""manage apps"" ""Running"" and why, oh why, is my bank app running?  To screw me over I assume, or waste my battery, or spy on me?  After enough ""problems"" like this I distrust apps.  Why does ""tune in radio pro"" waste ram and battery and probably do something nefarious by running 24x7?  I can justify dropbox syncing in the background.  I can justify doggcatcher polling my favorite podcasts periodically in the background.  Why is google googles running 24x7, how does that benefit me?  I mean benefit in reality, not marketing speak?  This mis-behavior gives apps in general an icky repellent smell.  If I install this app, how much battery life and privacy am I giving up?<p>Reminds me of the old days when people used to buy retail software, so to ""gain market share"" you would have giant boxes on the shelf with a tiny little CD and one sheet of paper inside the mostly empty box... literally push the competition right off the shelf...  In the modern era a site is so desperate they need to use the same strategy on my phone, that site probably is not worth visiting, if it had value it wouldn't depend on dirty tricks to gain market share.",1349702928

Put your email in your profile and I'll make sure to let you know when that's ready.<p>A little background: I have gotten many calls when legacy code has a bug or needs a critical enhancement and no one in-house is willing or able to figure it out. I'm no smarter than anyone else, but because I'm stupid and fearless, I often do something that few others attempt: I rewrite or refactor the code <i>first</i>, then work on the bug/enhancement. And the first thing I always do is look for early exits. This has always given me the most bang for my buck in making unintelligible code understandable. The only entry to any function or subroutine should be on the first line and the only exit should be on the last line.<p>This is never about what runs fastest or produces less lines of code. It's strictly about making life easier for the next programmer.<p>Early exits can make things really easy (I'll just get out now.) 20 lines of clean code. No problem. Until years later, when that function is 300 lines long, and the next programmer can't figure out what you're doing. Much of the maintenance had been done in emergency mode, each programmer just trying to get in and out as fast as they could.<p>Early exits make it much easier for bad things to evolve:<p><pre><code>  - 200 line multiple nested if statements
  - 200 line multiple nested recursions
  - unidentified but critical ""modes"" (add/change) (found/notFound)...
</code></pre>
Removing early exits forces you to understand what really should be happening and enables you to structure code into smaller, more intelligible pieces.<p>Short, hand-wavy response, but I hope that helps clarify some. Stay tuned for a better answer...",1349702527

You don't really <i>think</i> when you read a Malcolm Gladwell book. You just sort of scan it, page by page, your critical and evaluative faculties turned off, and nod your head. It's like the highly refined white flour of insight.<p>I admire Gladwell the man, and I think he probably has a net-positive impact on most people who read him. But he's highly disappointing for those who want a real spark of insight, or an intellectual exercise. (Also, tangentially speaking, his books are pretty repetitive; most of them could be summed up adequately by a single paragraph, if not a single-sentence logline).<p>I guess the real question is: are we, the self-described nerds of the article, really better off in a world full of Gladwells? Or were we better off when insight was hard to come by, and you had to go off looking for it? We have a lot more information and insight at our fingertips, but have our critical thinking skills atrophied accordingly? I realize you could take this line of thought a little too far and follow a sort of neo-Luddite vein with it. But that's not my intent. Rather, I'm just asking if all this ready-to-eat insight is actually good for us. I think it's good for the averages, but we probably think of ourselves as being at the margins.",1349702127

Of the three, I'd rate SWTOR the highest because (1) crew skills are an interesting mechanic and (2) the sheer overwhelming quantity of effort they put into the story was palpable and very impressive for an MMO. I'd like to see a new MMO borrow the crew skill concept and take it to the next level; it was under-exploited in SWTOR. The story made it enjoyable as a single-player experience, but it was otherwise meh. (I didn't finish any storyline, though I did make progress on all 8. My consular nearly finished, but I quit.)<p>With Rift, the invasion mechanics feel like something I'd enjoy, but that's probably it. I find myself feeling a bit lost about the mix-n-match class structure, but that is more a lack of research on my part than Trion's fault. The invasion mechanic is probably just like EVE's incursion mechanic. Neither was novel to me, though I had never seen it done in formal phases before. (I have experienced masses of suddenly-spawned enemies in GM-directed waves.)<p>And in WoW... all I experienced was the 1-20 grind of quest lines and vague storyish backdrop.

So in your example, rather than surveying particle physicists, you would look for another group of interested parties (e.g. a range of tax payers or non-specialist funding bodies) who have a vested interest (in this case in how their money is spent).<p>My work, for instance, revolves around surveying doctors on their experiences of medical training and career needs/aspirations. The vested interest of our participants is hopefully clear (influence on their training/career/work environment). We ask a wide range of factual and opinion based questions, eliminate biases (or segment responses on biases) due to various factors (e.g. location, age, gender etc.) and report our findings in the context of our cohort, i.e. ""these are the experiences and opinions of doctors"".<p>In short, you are right, you need to consider the makeup of your cohort and also how you report your findings in respect of that.

I consider this a ""minor"" issue, truth be told (I didn't want muddle up the conversation) I don't tend to run sshd faced towards the 'public' internet and in the cases where I do, ssh access is restricted to certain hosts/networks, and is enforced by a firewall.<p>> The rest of your recommendations is security theatre<p>Can you state why? I think they all provide measurable/real benefit, if this isn't the case I'd welcome some education.<p>Hm. I will give you that AllowUsers,AllowGroups is not a very good benefit in this case, I mainly enforce the usage of those directives to protect against problems such as bogus user account creations (exploit created or something simple as a admin mistake).<p>>An attacker dedicated enough to find your SSH-port<p>And Now for Something Completely Different.<p>Protecting against a dedicated attacker is a totally different ball game then protecting against drive-by's.",1349701243

At that time, I had trouble reading resistance values without resorting to a color reference chart, but the 555 I knew inside and out.<p>When you think about it, a design would have to be 'Uber-Elegant' to have a middle school kid be able to understand it like that. For the time, I think it was.<p>(As an aside, I can remember going ballistic on one of my friends who soldered one to a board. I would only use them on breadboards because I thought they were too 'valuable'. LOL! Money in middle school terms!)<p>I LOVED those 555's. Good times.",1349701208

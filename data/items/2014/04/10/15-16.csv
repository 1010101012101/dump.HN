There are certain issues that I do not have strong feelings on one way or the other, so I consider my opinion on those issues to be of relatively little consequence.  Nevertheless, I am still capable of analyzing and critiquing the merit of arguments made by others.<p>For instance, if the topic is tidal power stations being placed offshore of expensive private beach property <i>(a topic that I do not care about one way or the other)</i> and somebody objects that the view from those beaches will be destroyed, I might sarcastically quip that all transmission lines near golf courses and country clubs should be razed, because rich people should never be forced to gaze upon infrastructure.  I would give this sarcastic quip because, although I don&#x27;t really give a shit about tidal power, I can still recognize a ridiculous argument when I see one.",1397145445

The use of the word erroneous here is problematic. It doesn&#x27;t imply intention. If they had used a word that implied intention, then they would essentially be saying that the administration intentionally propagandized with information that they knew to be false toward the goal of leading the US into war with Iraq. But they don&#x27;t go that far. They use the word erroneous. IF the administration was unaware of the eroneousness of the information, then there&#x27;s no reason that &quot;methodically propagating&quot; it is immoral, I mean, this is called &quot;consciousness raising&quot; in other contexts.

Like &quot;fac(x) <i></i>is<i></i><p>¤ 1 if x == 1<p>¤ x * fac(x-1) otherwise&quot;<p>This is at least more declarative than describing the function with a loop. With an imperative program you kind of have to describe as a series of steps, because the order matters so much.<p>Personally I prefer this kind of declarative programming over something like Prolog since I get a simple way of describing what/how the program is, while still feeling declarative. With Prolog I <i>still</i> have to learn <i>how</i> it works, and the way that it works is more removed from imperative and functional programming (while functional programming can be done (maybe with, but in principle) in most imperative languages as long as you restrict your use of certain features). Plus Prolog has un-declarative things like the cut operator.

You already have mail, RSS readers, calendar apps, twitter clients, ... in whatever form, webapp, native desktop app or mobile apps - they all exist. They&#x27;re all using &#x27;the open web&#x27;. I think inter-operability is more important than &quot;it has to be html5&quot;. The open web is in my opinion: open API&#x27;s and data format. And that is exactly what we have, a large amount of mobile apps are just a native more intelligent client for some web API or content for which a website is also available. Twitter, Facebook, Reddit apps, Kickstarter, ... all have &#x27;native&#x27; apps - does that mean it&#x27;s less open than using a web-browser? No - it&#x27;s just optimized for mobile use, something that is very hard to do with pure html5. REST/JSON api&#x27;s have taken over the open web. Native or web-apps are just front-ends for these api&#x27;s - that&#x27;s the direction it&#x27;s moving in.<p>I don&#x27;t see the problem really, web-browsing still is one of the killer apps of a mobile device - tablet or phone, and that&#x27;s something neither Google, Apple, Microsoft, or any other large corporation will ever limit. Yes some apps are rejected for whatever reason, but there is competition to choose from if one of iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Firefox OS or Mobile Ubuntu makes choices in their rejections that conflict with your personal beliefs.",1397145203

Idris&#x27; Coerce typeclass). In order to do multiplication like you suggested you would have to provide enough information to the compiler (either at compile time via constants or via a possibly failing mechanism which generates proof requirements at runtime) that your multiplication will not violate the constraints of the type.<p>To you final point about tracking constraints, even those defined implicitly, I think the answer is no-ish. Most frequently, DT languages have such a richness of types that there&#x27;s no way to infer them—you&#x27;re forced to write out all of the top-level types. But the idea of passing around constraints like you&#x27;re suggesting here is not impossible.<p>You might imagine a pair type like (in no particular notation)<p><pre><code>    (x, x => [Constraint])\n</code></pre>\nwhere the first is a number and the second indicates a type-level function taking that particular number to a set of proofs that certain constraints are satisfied. We could indicate all of this at the type level and demand the compiler ensure that constraints are not violated (i.e. we end up coercing between constrained types like this and some coercions, those that coerce to supersets of the current constraints, are valid only) and we could also define a loose kind of (+), (*), (-) etc on this pair type such that the result passes along the proper constraints.",1397144684

If you open your mind, you will see that world history is chock full of systems that have scaled -- they just don&#x27;t happen to be written in binary or backed by CS degrees. And I would say that these historical systems share more similarities than you would think with scalable computer systems.<p>In order to be good at this kind of thing, one just needs some sense for abstract thinking -- which countless non-programmers have, we are actually not unique in that regard -- and if you are adequately dedicated, a few weeks (or a few months at most) of study time to understand fundamental algos and data structures.

On the one hand, I absolutely agree with most of the opposition to Condi Rice wrt the illegal war, warrantless wiretaps, torture, etc. On the other hand, I threw a hissy fit over the opposition to Eich based on his beliefs. I&#x27;m not sure how I can oppose Rice while standing up for Eich without inconsistency.<p>The issue here isn&#x27;t just about someone&#x27;s personal beliefs. Eich and Rice both operate at very high levels within their organizations and that means they both have a leadership role and are representatives of those companies to the larger public. When people have a problem with those people&#x27;s actions and point of view, they most certainly have a right to voice that disagreement.<p>It is important to note that a personal belief which is discriminatory (Eich) does not make that belief legitimate. Why exactly should Eich be defended at all? Support of legalized discrimination against groups of people is morally reprehensible, even if you think marriage isn&#x27;t that big of an issue. In the case of Rice, a track record of getting people tortured and killed is horrifying and this person should not be supported.<p>When a business selects someone to join a C-level position or its board of directors, they are endorsing that person completely, including the unseemly things they do or endorse that do not directly relate to the company. You can&#x27;t separate the two, a company is empowering a person to a degree when they get that position and that is a form of direct support of that person.",1397143965

7567022,comment,7566069,7566586,4,0,midnitewarrior,,,"> The leap from open source to pro-gay sounds like a complete non sequitur to me. What is the reasoning there?<p>Your characterization of it being a &quot;leap to pro-gay&quot; is a bit much.  Supporters of Prop 8 are actively trying to deny other Americans rights, many people find this offensive, regardless of the grounds for denial.  It echoes racial, gender and age discrimination of the past -- things that many find to be un-American.  The fact that the people affected happen to be gay is secondary for many who opposed Prop 8.  No American should be legislated as a second class citizen.<p>Open Source is about open access, both to contribute and use.  Prop 8 was trying to deny people access to government, rights and benefits.  These attitudes are in direct opposition.<p>Beyond the ideological friction, you are dividing the community of users and contributors -- people who support gay rights and marriage equality somehow feel like they are supporting somebody who is trying to change society by denying people rights.<p>Mozilla isn&#x27;t driven by profit, it&#x27;s driven by the goodwill of its users and contributors.  Mr. Eich was well aware of the sensitive nature of people&#x27;s attitudes towards his contribution -- he&#x27;s tried for years to make it a non-issue, but it has kept following him.<p>It&#x27;s not that Open Source is &quot;pro-gay rights&quot;, it&#x27;s that it is pro-open access and equality.  Mr. Eich&#x27;s contribution shows contempt for this ideal at some level.  It appears that many had issue with this.<p>Additionally, Google, Mozilla&#x27;s largest financial contributor, is a company that has actively taken a strongly anti-Prop 8 stance.  Having the leader of the Mozilla Foundation be openly in opposition to Google&#x27;s stance brings questions about if this will ultimately affect Mozilla&#x27;s funding.<p>Mr. Eich&#x27;s technical leadership and history with Mozilla probably qualifies him as a very competent leader for the organization, however the political realities of Mozilla&#x27;s relationship with Google and the open source community&#x27;s ideals creates doubt about the realities of his ability to manage these important relationships between Google, users and contributors.",1397143947

7567018,comment,7565153,7565153,11,0,jarrett,,,"A thought on dependent types:<p>Can a dependent type system catch <i>all</i> type errors at compile time? For example, suppose I write the following (in pseudo-code):<p><pre><code>  // Variable x is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than 256.\n  int x (>=0, <256) \n\n  x = 128 // This is valid.\n  x = x * 3 // This violates the type.\n</code></pre>\nI can imagine how a compiler could catch that kind of error. But that&#x27;s trivial. What happens in programs like this:<p><pre><code>  int x (>= 0, <=10)\n  x = parseInt(getKeyboardInput)\n</code></pre>\nNow the compiler can&#x27;t know for sure whether the type has been violated, because the value of getKeyboardInput could be anything. To take a page from Haskell, you could do something like this (which is still pseudocode, not valid Haskell):<p><pre><code>  // x is a value that is either 1) an int from 0 to 10, or 2) nothing at all.\n  maybe (int (>= 0, <=10) x\n  \n  // applyConstraint recognizes that parseInt may return a value violating x&#x27;s contraints.\n  // Thus it transforms the return type of parseInt from int to maybe (int (>= 0, <=10)\n  x = applyConstraint(parseInt(getKeyboardInput))\n</code></pre>\nOr perhaps applyConstraint wouldn&#x27;t have to be called explicitly, but would be implicitly added by the compiler as needed. I&#x27;m not sure which is better stylistically.<p>Either way, applyConstraint would be required any time a computation could return an invalid value. That would get tricky, because the compiler would have to track the constraints on every variable, even where those constraints aren&#x27;t declared. For example:<p><pre><code>  int w (>= 0, <= 10)\n  int x (>= 0, <= 2)\n  int y\n  int z (>= 0, <= 20)\n\n  y = w * x\n  z = y\n</code></pre>\nHere, the compiler would have to infer from the assignment &quot;y = w * x&quot; that y is always between 0 and 20.<p>Do any languages currently take the idea this far (or farther)?",1397143913

Like, instead of feigning surprise to shame someone for their lack of knowledge, take the opportunity to teach someone something valuable, if they&#x27;d like to learn about it.

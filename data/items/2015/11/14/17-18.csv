It was an amazing group of people.<p>But what has become Agile™ is, in my view, the same managerial power structures co-opting the vocabulary and the energy for change into something so watered down that it has a lot of the same problems. [2] This works for many organizations because their actual priorities are less about getting things done or delivering customer value, and more about maintaining primate status hierarchies and letting people play out their office dramas.<p>So for those people who are at the rare organizations that would like to get something done, I encourage them to dig past the pile of Agile™ horseshit to find the perfectly serviceable horses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://agilemanifesto.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a><p>[2] I&#x27;ve written more about this here: <a href=""http://agilefocus.com/2011/02/21/agiles-second-chasm-and-how-we-fell-in/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agilefocus.com/2011/02/21/agiles-second-chasm-and-how...</a>",1447523852

(eg. crispy needs to breathe, yet be kept warm)<p>I wonder how much room there is to specialize in doing this right.<p>The vast majority of the time I order delivery, food tends to come in super-budget containers that degrade the experience. Pizzas arriving in cardboard boxes, the taste altered by 10+ minutes of steaming and dripping oil... asian food tends to arrive in the clam-shell styrofoam containers that mush up some vegetables or turn crispy fried food soggy, with sauces in thin plastic cups that invariably leak at least a little... When was the last time anyone rethought delivery?<p>The experience could be so much better. What if soups used parfait-style containers to keep the liquids separate from dry mix-ins (eg fried chicken) until right before consumption? What if pizza boxes had oil-absorbant padding and better venting? And what about standardizing those container sizes like we standardized shipping containers, so food doesn&#x27;t get jumbled in a plastic bag? Seems like that would open the window to containers with heating/cooling packs as well, which would help batch-deliver orders more efficiently.<p>How much of a market is there for companies that handle shipping <i>and</i> packaging/handling of delivery orders?

Food is (statistically) very safe before the best before date, assuming proper storage. Most of the time it&#x27;s still safe well past that date, but you would dramatically increase the number of people who get sick.<p>It&#x27;s the same with pasteurized milk. Unpasteurized milk is mostly safe to drink, but occasionally you get really sick. In a large population the difference is noticeable.<p>Again the same with the much stricter cleanliness rules for restaurants and the like. Usually it&#x27;s safe to store prepared food without refrigeration for a day, restaurants mustn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s also mostly safe to cook on a dirty stove, restaurants mustn&#x27;t.

They&#x27;d form these temporary &quot;feature teams&quot;, where they&#x27;d assign more programmers than were needed to a problem, while other important concerns were left abandoned. From a management optics standpoint, it let them tell the executives &quot;Look how serious we are about this feature!&quot; From a practical standpoint it was pretty much a disaster. You would end up with one person actually qualified to do the work being dragged in five directions by trying to manage five other people who were well meaning, but had no idea what to do.

10566514,comment,10565629,10566313,0,0,insoluble,,,"> it seems that the proximate cause can&#x27;t be the Islamic scriptures alone.<p>My hypothesis is twofold: (1) The people doing the violence have been sold on these passages of the scriptures by others; and (2) The people doing this selling are acting for another reason. Hence, the scriptures are serving as a <i>justification</i>, not a cause in and of themselves. There were plenty of times in history where Christians used passages to justify their actions, while the actions themselves were motivated by completely different desires. Essentially the people in discussion here are using scriptures in the same way that lawyers use legal code -- not as a reason to sue, but as a justification of why suit is permissible.<p>It&#x27;s all too easy to point a finger at the justification being used. In fact, the ego loves doing so since it helps one to remain willfully ignorant of the actual reasons behind the occurrences. Religion is not the cause; Religion is the justification. Without looking at the cause, one cannot answer the why, nor can one know how to resolve the issue without jumping on the &quot;It&#x27;s all the religion&#x27;s fault&quot; bandwagon.

This is the bulk of the market, say 75%.<p>But then there are 15% of people who are sincere, very smart, and deep thinkers. This is often a hindrance in making a buck. Their ideas are so radical (in both senses of the word) that a lot of their potential audience gets scared off. However, they are definitely worth listening to. Their solutions may not match your circumstances, so you shouldn&#x27;t follow them blindly.

Setting up the development environment specific to some project typically amounts to following some perpetually out-of-date check list of things you have to do<p>3. Painfully figuring out why 1) and 2) aren&#x27;t really working out, and what&#x27;s missing from those checklists<p>4.

Finally getting to work on things, making small incremental changes to your environment as you go<p>6. Realizing that the small incremental changes you make actually makes things break when you try to integrate or deploy your work, because the parity between local dev and CI and live environments just isn&#x27;t there<p>7. Having some coffee and lament the state of affairs with your co-workers, yet not really do anything to change things; either because you can&#x27;t really get anywhere in due time (1000+ engineers kind of organization) or because the law of the jungle dictates you have to keep shipping(tm) (5-20 engineers kind of organization) so there&#x27;s never any time to deal with the debt that just, keeps, building<p>8. Cry yourself to sleep<p>There are minute differences, but this is the general pattern I&#x27;ve seen through my decade long experience as a software engineer.<p>An important aspect of why this is – I think – stems from thinking your project or setup is a unique snow flake. It&#x27;s really not. What you&#x27;re doing is probably not earth shatteringly new and exciting, and even if it is, most of the things you do to get you there aren&#x27;t. We are all standing on the shoulders of giants, but instead of realizing that and codifying all that knowledge into tooling we can just rely on, we seem to keep thinking that if only we have full control over things we&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Then there&#x27;s the other side of that coin, which is to say you don&#x27;t ever want to have control (for whatever reasons,) and so you hand over everything services that&#x27;ll build and deploy things magically for you, so long as you have the proper configurations. The promise of those offerings are alluring, and when they work it&#x27;s great, but inevitably you end up with configuration no longer being best practice, or formats change, or the service pivots; so promises are broken.<p>My feeling is that the answer as usual probably lies somewhere in the middle of having full control, and relinquishing most or all of it.<p>If I understand things correctly, straddling this divide is what Otto wants to do, and Just Work(tm) for the 80% (perhaps more like 99.99%?) of projects that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> unique snow flakes. The others aren&#x27;t the target market, and for them the tooling already exists in various forms anyway.<p>It&#x27;s an ambitious goal; sure to be fraught with edge cases and rabbit holes.<p>I hope it works out.",1447522249

The ability to do things like complicated functional composition, &#x27;flip&#x27;, and other higher-order function tricks is in large part facilitated by Haskell&#x27;s powerful and expressive type system, and of course established idioms and nice syntax which facilitates using those techniques in real-world code in a clear way. Unfortunately, without those things I feel like this comes across as a bunch of &quot;cute tricks&quot; rather than actual code you&#x27;d want to use in a code base (outside of personal projects perhaps). That, and the particulars of the functions are different because they are aimed at multi-parameter functions rather than currying, which makes their behavior different from their Haskell counterparts anyway.",1447522126

Now is one of them.<p>We&#x27;ve forgotten what the oil market was like before Standard Oil. First off, cars didn&#x27;t exist, uses for oil were limited to small-ish industrial products like lubricants, and for lamps. There certainly wasn&#x27;t anything like today&#x27;s power infrastructure, internal-combustion engines had yet to be invented.<p>Oil producers were an unruly lot responding mostly to immediate financial needs rather than long-term business planning. Oil was a niche product with vast differences in quality among refiners. Only the affluent could really afford to regularly light their lamps at night.<p>Rockefeller changed all that, virtually overnight. He wrangled the impossible-to-deal-with oilmen and standardized the refining process, something that had to happen before it was possible to invent the automobile. Standard Oil, more than any other person or company, created the world we live in. Without Rockefeller, cars wouldn&#x27;t have been possible. Oil power plants wouldn&#x27;t have been possible. Without oil, we&#x27;d still be using coal.<p>Cartels stabilize violent markets and allow industries to mature and build on top of a stable status quo. Eventually civilization moves in, and brings regulation and massive capital infusion. That&#x27;s obviously better than the cartel, but don&#x27;t mistake things, cartels are vastly better than the states of affairs they grow out of.",1447521297

They should do away with tips and overhaul their post-experience rating system.  Right now the only options are to give one overall rating to the whole experience, which is useless, or to report a problem, and even then you&#x27;re only able to report one problem.  If, for example, both your delivery was messed up and the order was wrong, you can&#x27;t tell DoorDash about both.  You have to choose one.

Compare to Uber who has responded to all my inquiries within 3 minutes.<p>Still worse, when I report a problem with my order (wrong items) ... who gets blamed?

Given that this is clearly a problem unique to Islam in the modern age, it seems that the proximate cause can&#x27;t be the Islamic scriptures alone.<p>Even if I&#x27;m not convinced, I disagree that you deserve to be downvoted. You&#x27;ve voiced an unpopular opinion, but it isn&#x27;t rude or inflammatory (except possibly for the Santa analogy) and doesn&#x27;t advocate inhumane behavior toward Muslims.",1447520547

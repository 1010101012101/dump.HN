9468329,comment,9467678,9468015,0,0,bad_user,,,"From my experience thus far the .NET community is not friendly to open-source. Yes, open-source projects do exist, but those are few and far between, being either ports from the Java world, or throwaways that failed as commercial projects. There are also instances of bait and switch, as in projects starting as open-source being closed later (e.g. ServiceStack). Also compare RoboVM.com with Xamarin.com. If you&#x27;ll dig into the details, you&#x27;ll see similarities (like comparable pricing), with one important difference ... RoboVM is open-source and you only need a subscription for extra goodies. Same thing with IntelliJ IDEA versus Visual Studio. I find this difference to be the essence of the .NET ecosystem versus the others.<p>You mentioned NuGet, which is like `gem`. Well, the build tools in .NET land suck really badly. You&#x27;ve got MSBuild, which is like Ant or Make and that&#x27;s what everybody uses, because development in .NET-land is Visual Studio driven. What you don&#x27;t have for example is something like Maven (or SBT, or Lein). There&#x27;s been nothing like it in .NET land. The ASP.NET developers have been building an alternative, in the form of dnvm / dnx / dnu, but it&#x27;s just getting started, being a work in progress and feeling hack-ish and incomplete. Fingers crossed.<p>Anyway, in spite of the fact that there are companies that have built their own build tools because the current status quo sucks so badly (and I know more than one), the .NET community is filled with closed-minded folks that will never admit that their tooling sucks and I&#x27;m even including Visual Studio itself in this mix, since an IDE that needs extra investments into ReSharper is not that good in my opinion.<p>And then there&#x27;s Mono, the current cross-platform implementation and the answer to folks that want to develop and deploy on Linux, OS X, Android or iOS. Except that Mono is and has historically been full of bugs. Like if you want to do server side development and deploy on Mono, just forget about it. And these days Xamarin is focusing only on mobile development and the community is dead.<p>> <i>Would, say, a Ruby or node.js-oriented web developer find the F#/.NET community lacking, incomplete, unfriendly, uncool?

Luckily these &#x27;slip ups&#x27; are typically simple things like certs expiring or supporting outdated cipher suites. These are just minor configuration fixes that things like Lets Encrypt aim to fix (both distribution and configuration of TLS). The thing is, even the worst &#x27;slip ups&#x27; don&#x27;t make you any more insecure than only supporting HTTP. _Any_ amount of TLS is better than none. That is a weak argument to start with.<p>>&quot;SSL is bloody expensive compared to not doing it.&quot;<p>No it’s not. Certs are not expensive (another thing improved by Let’s Encrypt). This opinion exists from people spreading these kinds of rumors. It’s 2015 and the minor difference in processing power is negligible. If your web hosting can’t handle the difference in processing costs, you need to look for a better hosting platform.<p>>&quot;Not only does that mean that you are downloading a really big certificate, but also that the SSL encryption is a bit of a lie for you as a user.”<p>&#x27;Really big certificate&#x27; when has this been an issue for anyone ever? A CDN providing SSL is still better than no SSL. That &quot;lie&quot; _still_ protects the user at their host->Local Router->ISP->CDN. This is massive value not offered via just HTTP.<p>>&quot;The cost of deploying SSL should not be underestimated, and forcing SSL on people out of principle should consider that.”<p>The cost raised by implementing SSL vs the cost of hosting a web application is negligible. It&#x27;s pennies on the dollar to ensure your users can have a safer experience using your site. Security comes at a cost, this is part of life.<p>>&quot;The second method is to go to the local ISP and tell them to disable access to it. The rather is the better option in the sense that it only affects the citizens of that country and it isolates the problem. Unfortunately, SSL prevents this.”<p>Yep it&#x27;s a real shame that it&#x27;s harder to censor websites. Joe Shmoe the intended reader shouldn&#x27;t use SSL just in case the government wants to blacklist his domain.<p>>&quot;Even Ad providers (Superfish cough) started to destroy SSL traffic because it became so widespread that it was necessary. I&#x27;m firmly of the opinion that none of that would have happened if SSL traffic was less common. “<p>THE WHOLE REASON THESE AD PROVIDERS ARE BREAKING SSL IS BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER WILLY NILLY READ/INJECT YOUR TRAFFIC. This exactly what Version + AT&T&#x27;s &quot;super cookie&quot; was doing to HTTP traffic. SSL _prevents_ shit like this from happening. SSL being less common in no way equals less ads reading/injecting your content.<p>>&quot;The greatest impact on user&#x27;s safety would have been the development of per user encryption for public Wifi access points.”<p>This exists. It&#x27;s called IPSec and it&#x27;s a way bigger hassle than SSL, so we all agreed in the 90&#x27;s that it made more sense to prioritize SSL over IPSec.<p>>&quot;Instead what happened is that now every larger website has to implement SSL to protect against the only realistic attack vector which is someone surfing at Starbucks.”<p>This is absolutely false. I would argue the _most_ users are at risk further down the pipeline, not at Starbucks. We know for a fact that ISP&#x27;s like Verizon have injected cookies into HTTP traffic leaving their networks and we know for a fact that Governments have done dragnet collections of HTTP traffic. SSL protects users at every step of their internet journey, suggesting half ass encryption is bullshit.<p>>&quot;I now no longer claim I have any understanding of SSL at all.”<p>This is the most accurate statement he makes in the entire article.<p>>&quot;Cryptography is black magic.”<p>Here in lies the problem. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s actually the opposite, it&#x27;s open source and it&#x27;s inner workings can be explained by a multitude of resources. The various features you call &#x27;bugs&#x27; in SSL/TLS are things the security community has refined over many years. Crypto is hard, and a lot of things that seem intuitive are not. TLS exists in it&#x27;s current state because it accomplishes what we want crypto to do. Saying &quot;everyone fuck this thing I&#x27;m frustrated with&quot; is counter productive to the whole process. ANY amount of SSL is better for the user than none.<p>>&quot;but the truth is that the most popular cryptography library (OpenSSL) is an old and complex mess. Even if the library itself would be okay, there are so many ways to misuse it and it&#x27;s really badly documented.”<p>Oh boi let&#x27;s jump on the OpenSSL hate wagon. We know OpenSSL has had it&#x27;s issues and there are lots of people helping to make it better (<a href=""https://cryptoservices.github.io/…/2015/03/09/openssl-audit…"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cryptoservices.github.io/…/2015/03/09/openssl-audit…</a>). The fact that OpenSSL has the occasional implementation error doesn&#x27;t make the SSL/TLS protocol any worse.<p>>&quot;Gone are the days where you could fully understand how a web application works.“<p>This has gone from trying to make some kind of point to full whine fest. Yes, web applications have become complicated. So have all parts of technology. As things grow their internals become more intricate and complicated. Also gone are the days where you can fully understand the inner workings of your car engine. Doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t use airbags.<p>>&quot;As of recently the Python package installer downloads every package via SSL. Why? There is no technical reason for this unless you want to hide from someone that you are downloading a specific Python package which seems pointless.&quot;<p>Or you know, you don&#x27;t want packages injected/swapped out with malware when you download them. If I&#x27;m downloading code I&#x27;m about to run on my system, you better be sure as hell I&#x27;m going to want to want integrity and confidentiality of said code. TLS is a standardized way of ensuring both of those things.<p>>&quot;It&#x27;s plenty to download the package over an untrusted connection and to then verify the checksum with one you downloaded from a secure place.&quot;<p>WHERE IS THIS MAGICALLY SECURE PLACE? HOW DOES ONE COMMUNICATE WITH THIS SECURE PLACE? For a guy who considers SSL to be too much effort, I&#x27;m to believe that everything he downloads is checked against checksums received via his &#x27;secure place&#x27;",1430436793

That along with Gorillas on qbasic was really my first entry into programming.<p>Back then I was about 9 years old, I really wanted to make computer games, I was pretty smart, but in 1991, a kid with no resources has a hard time breaking into programming.<p>But QBasic had gorillas, which was a GAME! And it was in basic, and so the source code was right there for me.  I didn&#x27;t have books really, because while you got QB with your operating system, you didn&#x27;t get manuals for it or anything.  But the Visual Basic came with books, and help.<p>Not only that, it used the same language as gorillas, more or less, and I could drag and drop elements on to the canvas.<p>By 9 or 10 I made my first &quot;RPG&quot; in visual basic.  I used an array of picture boxes as tiles.  I had 4 buttons that were directional arrows.  And when you clicked one of the directional arrows it would figure out where your player was, see if he could go into the next tile based on what picture it was, and if it could, it would swap the picture of the destination with the picture of the player, the original picture of the player with the original picture of the source.  I don&#x27;t remember if I tracked the position of the player by x/y coordinates or if I just scanned through all of the tiles to find the first one with the player image.<p>But what I do know was that by 9 or 10 I had made myself a little &quot;game&quot; where you had a top down grid that you could make a player walk around on, and that moved to something that spawned random encounters that were in another window.<p>I look at what I had as tools, and it was so little.  I didn&#x27;t even have a single book about programming.  All I had was gorillas and some help docs for VB. But I was so proud of what I&#x27;d made.  I ran into some of the pitfalls of memory management when all of your tiles are giant windows objects in VB.<p>Later I started to learn to get VGA graphics with mode 13h which I found out about from a copy of the Peter Norton&#x27;s Guide to Programming the IBM PC that I got from the library.  I wrote some inline assembler in basic to do some basic putpixel getpixel stuff.  I did a lot of cool stuff there but ran into some of the limitations of trying to work with BASIC.<p>From there my dad had a copy of Borland C++ from his office that I used, mostly just learning C, and when I got access to the internet I started using turbo pascal.<p>In high school at about 14-15 I had friends who showed me MUDs, and a few of us worked on a little MOO.  I took some of my knowledge and a copy of Visual C++, and implemented a little terminal emulator that would connect to the MOO.  Then I had some rooms send some additional codes that the terminal emulator would parse and display things on the screen.  I made a pseudo MMO before MMOs were a thing.  There were MUDs, but very little graphical existed, there were things like The Realm, which was sort of the same type of idea, but I didn&#x27;t know about it at the time.<p>The reason I&#x27;m telling this story isn&#x27;t to say how great I am.  My point is that I read about these stupid programming curricula in school that are mandatory for kids.  As though sitting them down and forcing them to program is going to help them.  I had to do some of that in my own school career, in having to do LOGO WRITER stuff in computer class.  But doing that, I could barely even tell that that was programming.  And even if the teachers told me it was, it wasn&#x27;t the kind of programming I wanted to do.  That&#x27;s just drawing spirographs on the screen.  I wanted to make games.<p>It&#x27;s the same way as learning to write &quot;Hello World&quot; and store a variable, and calculate some tax on a price and all the other incredibly boring stuff that introductory programming classes have you do.<p>People assume kids are stupid. They assume that they have to give them the most basic foundations or they will not be able to learn.  Teachers don&#x27;t want to teach kids to make games, not because they don&#x27;t want it to be fun, but because of an idea that a game is way too hard to start with.  That you have to build up the foundations first.  That you need to teach the fundamentals, master them, and then move on to the next marginally more challenging step.<p>Well, maybe not teachers, I know a lot of good teachers, but the people who write the curriculum think that.  Because you need to be able to test and evaluate, so you need to know that you can check of a box that says the kid knows how to do variable assignment, create a function, get input, whatever else.<p>But I didn&#x27;t have that shit.  I had gorillas.bas I didn&#x27;t know what &quot;EGABanana:\n  &#x27;BananaLeft\n  DATA 458758,202116096,471604224,943208448,943208448,943208448,471604224,202116096,0&quot;<p>meant.  Nobody taught me that. But I think BECAUSE nobody taught me that, I wasn&#x27;t afraid to just mess with the numbers a little bit, run it and see what happened.  Oh, changing those numbers changes the way that the banana looks? Ok cool. I mean, there was trigonometry, there was all sorts of stuff that even now looking again through it it takes me a while to parse.<p>But I didn&#x27;t care.  I tried to look through for something that I could understand, I picked it out, I figured out how it worked, and then I had one piece of the puzzle solved.  Now all of the FOR, NEXT loops make sense, and I can use that in my other program.<p>Now I imagine the 9 year old me in today&#x27;s world.  I don&#x27;t have to rely on my parents having bought VB or Borland C++, I can download Visual Studio for free.  I have the ability to create a minecraft mod in a matter of minutes which on its own is interesting enough, but it basically means I have a tile-based game engine at my disposal, but I&#x27;m also writing raw code and not just strapped into some Logo-writer type sandbox.  If I have a question the Internet can answer it 150 different ways.<p>Honestly, the only thing I worry about is that by the time 11-year old me starts to work on something like this I will have decided I hate programming because of the kind of soul-sucking programming curriculum I&#x27;ve had to work on in computer class so I don&#x27;t even bother trying.<p>It&#x27;s like Math.  I think math is really awesome and interesting.  It&#x27;s artistic, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s complex, it&#x27;s beautiful, it&#x27;s actually fun and engaging.  Math and programming are very similar in that way.  But ask a selection of 10 year olds what they think of Math and they will almost all tell you they hate it.

But getting in step with a lot of other developers, and hopefully playing nice, will get them a seat at the table with all developers, instead of projecting an attitude of: the world revolves around us.  MS has been making some remarkable announcements at this Build conference, and making it easier for developers to get into MS technologies as well.

I suspect the speeds are simply so fast that we don&#x27;t have the ability to intuitively appreciate just how far we are traveling.

When I fly a lot the world is reduced to a network of airports.<p>An example from my own life.

Divide by 300k (which is a planeload) and you get roughly 74 planeloads of iPhones per quarter.<p>Currently there are about half a dozen 747 freighters each day flying PVG-ANC. So at most it&#x27;s about 12 days&#x27; capacity of that one route each quarter, meaning it tops out at 10% of the overall capacity on the route each quarter.<p>And it <i>still</i> is a drop in the bucket compared to worldwide air cargo. Remember one planeload of iPhones is 533,841 RTK. We&#x27;re talking now about 74 per quarter, which is 296 planeloads/year. 296 * 533,841 = 158,016,936 RTK represented in iPhones coming to the United States in a year.<p>And global air cargo is 208,000,000,000 RTK/year. Divide 158,016,936 by that, and you get a figure of: 0.0007596968076923077.

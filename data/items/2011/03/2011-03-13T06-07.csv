A round is a simple form of a canon. Think of the melody to Frere Jacques.<p>From a perspective of form, this song expands on the basic concept of a round by playing with double time, half time, quarter time, etc.<p>It has a lot of elements of serialist music, in which a musical pattern is subjected to a number of operations, although this song doesn't venture in to the more strict forms of twelve-tone composition. It is more along the lines of minimalist composers like Steve Reich and Phillip Glass, who took some of serialism's academic approaches to composition and made them hypnotic and rhythmic. In a sense, making fruit-of-the-earth pop music out of some sort of cerebral concept.<p>Overall the musical production is of pretty damn good quality. The performances sound good and the recordings were well made. The variation of instruments is impressive and the introduction of various pop styles keeps the concept novel.<p>One of my main gripes with ""math music"" is that it can be downright unenjoyable on an aesthetic level.<p>This song does a very good job of taking something inherently non-musical and making it pleasing to the ears, all while strictly adhering to a set of rules laid out before composition began.",1299997139

As I understand it, iOS hasn't previously allowed execution of code from ""data memory"" (various people were curious about this very thing when it was announced they were shipping a JIT). Presumably, the Safari process has some special flag that allows it to write to executable memory, but most other processes do not.

(Wikileaks just tweeted and fb'd us)",,"Hey HN,<p>The site in question: http://epicstep.com<p>I recently helped launch a startup called Epic Step that crowdsources billboards in America. I work at a dev shop in Los Angeles, we built it, but it's not technically ours. The guys decided to launch it in a somewhat limited alpha mode (good idea) to prevent the site from imploding. Basically, launch with a few campaigns and let people interact with those, limiting the creation of new ones.<p>One of the first campaigns is for a Wikileaks billboard in Los Angeles. Wikileaks tweeted about it today, and just threw it on their Facebook page. The Facebook story has ~700 likes and a lot of comments, and the site is getting hit pretty good right now.<p>The site is built in Django. The stack it's running on right now is a 512mb Slicehost with nginx and uWSGI, MySQL for the db. It's actually doing pretty damn well right now... server was swapping but has about 130mb of free memory right now. CPU usage is also surprisingly low, most of what we're facing right now is high mem usage.<p>Right now my battle plan is: if mem usage gets too incredibly high, just resize the slice and once things settle out we'll built out better infrastructure.<p>TLDR: Are there any other things we can do to improve performance for this evening? I'm worried that the Wikileaks traffic is going to destroy this!<p>I'm terrified because while two very high-traffic sources are linking to us, the site is doing fine right now and that just doesn't sit right.

But what most don't see, is that period before the bubble and that after the bubble. We know the fact that Dubai served the rich in ways we can't imagine, but it was also Dubai's leaders vision, to catch the bubble and make use of it. Without the bubble, Dubai would be just another city. But this vision also include an overlook state: to stay close to it's core culture.<p>If you go out in Dubai, the cultural difference is noticeable. You won't see any racism, indifference, etc though. People living together. What was created from this, a modern time marvel. You won't understand these lines, until you have lived in Dubai. It is what a modern city should be like. And now, with all the bubble gone, sure the real estate won't be like before, bu the bubble left behind a glorious beauty.

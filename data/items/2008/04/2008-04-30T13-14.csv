177473,comment,177427,177427,0,0,mynameishere,,,"He's being glib throughout (and the content obviously provides no direct commentary about startups), but I've spent serious thought on the question of ""buying one's freedom"", as I phrase it. The ultimate goal of working really should be either 1) The pure enjoyment of work itself, or 2) Not working, and so getting your life back. There are various elective methods:<p>1) Having a successful business, and cashing out young enough to enjoy life.<p>2) Gambling and winning.<p>3) Saving enough money to live on the interest.<p>The latter is the only sure-thing available to people. When you really do the math, however, you see that ""saving"" isn't really the heart of it. A rough calculation suggests that for every 50 dollars of expense per month you have, you need 10000 dollars in a typical safe bond fund. (This is optimistic, actually.)<p>So, if your total expenses are 1000 dollars a month, you need 200,000 dollars invested. The typical person is lucky to save 10,000 a year. Thus (not including interest on the money) it takes 20 years to save up that much. With interest, it might take about half as much.<p>The point is: For every 50 dollars of expense that you require while <i>not working</i> you will need to work an additional .5 through 1.0 years, depending on interest earnings. Thus: If you re-work the numbers and say,<p>""Well, in my retirement, I can discard cable (at 50/month)""<p>...that one small concession allows you to retire up to a year earlier, on average. If you can live a Thoreau-esque lifestyle, you can retire many, many years earlier than otherwise. This is not so unreasonable when you consider that humans aren't biologically intended to live amidst luxury.",1209563771

177467,comment,177380,177380,0,0,smoody,,,"Actually,they claim to develop a 'PROTOTYPE,' not a shippable product. There can be a large chasm between the two.<p>They way I interpret their service is like this: They build enough of a prototype to help you get funding. They make no mention of taking you the rest of the way. Nor do they claim to build 100% of your functionality.<p>If that's true, then you will end-up walking into a VC/angel office and showing the prototype. The person across the table will ask you how long it will take to turn the prototype into a launched product. So, here's the question: Can the prototype they develop even be turned into a real product or is it throw-away code only mean to help you raise money? What if they're writing crappy throw-away code and you know it, can you ask them to improve their engineering? Probably not because they're writing a prototype.<p>If you walk into a funding meeting with a prototype but without an engineering team, your chances of getting funded are pretty slim, IMHO. But, it is possible that a good prototype can help you attract engineers, so maybe that's not so bad.",1209563211

Sounds plausible.<p>>(It turns out that the same pattern prevails even when a Republican president is succeeded by another Republican.)<p>I take that back, sample size 2.<p>I'd be really curious to see the leave one out error for his statistics (i.e., throw away Nixon and Clinton, and see if the result persists).<p>Look, I hate Bush and McCain as much as most people (I liked Paul, however). But this book is just propaganda.",1209563159

The people on HN seem to care a lot about lawsuits and companies copying eachothers features, but most people buying smartphones couldn&#x27;t care less. People don&#x27;t care who invented something first or who sues who, people just pick whatever seems to be the best product that they can afford.<p>I don&#x27;t think that HTC failed because of a lawsuit; Samsung was pretty successful despite all the lawsuits, and Apple is similarly killing it despite constantly being sued from all kinds of companies.",1439366267

The script uses a rich set of built in &quot;function kit&quot; such as &quot;fullmoon&quot;, &quot;newmoon&quot; etc. Things like Easter need the moon, and so do many religious festivals.<p>The generator returns the NEXT datetime, so that the calendar can chain these events so that scrolling works nicely and you only calculate what you need.<p># Example Generators<p>## Annual date (eg birthdays)

Most social groups fall into the latter category, whereas most project groups fall into the former. (There are also, of course, groups that buck the trend. The Xiphos developers, for example, are simultaneously both types of group and there are lots of groups that arise from circumstance that fit neither; enough, in fact, that they may be best described as a third category)<p>With belief-based groups, it&#x27;s somewhat reasonable to use one person&#x27;s beliefs as a predictor of the group&#x27;s beliefs; if the guy leading your kid&#x27;s youth group starts spouting racist nonsense, then it may be time to find a new youth group. However, that&#x27;s not true of project groups outside of the radical left¹, where people often put aside their differences in beliefs to further some other goal. Circumstantial groups are similarly heterogeneous: just because one Redditor is a staunch /r/MensRights follower doesn&#x27;t mean that another can&#x27;t find that subreddit abhorrent and instead follow /r/shitredditsays.<p>I think the reason that making the separation feels difficult for many people is that they find themselves in far more belief-driven groups than purpose-driven groups, and don&#x27;t notice the circumstantial groups that they&#x27;re part of.<p>¹ The American radical left focuses somewhat horrifyingly on ideological purity, to the point that many gay gun enthusiasts find more acceptance in gun clubs than gay rights groups.",1439365229

We (the GPU providers) design the graphics processors and write the drivers/compilers to support Khronos.

You can try to blame someone else, or you can take responsibility and create improvements yourself. In this case it appears you are trying to blame YC for what is not working for you. What comes of this trying to blame someone else? Well, you get to pretend that they are wrong, and therefore, by implication, you get to feel “right”.

Almost all controlled diet studies are conducted over short periods of time and are therefore useless as the basis of any long term lifestyle advice (if you want to make any difference to your long-term weight you need to make changes that span years, if not the rest of your life).  This is almost inherent in diet studies, because most participants won&#x27;t accept these kinds of things (skipping breakfast) or even eating a particular diet for long enough periods of time.  Imagine as a participant being asked to skip breakfast for 2 years in order to give a decent study length.  They&#x27;re either going to refuse to participate, or have a significant chance of failing to comply with the requirements.  This is the reason that so many long-term diet studies are observational (i.e. uncontrolled, just looking at what people do naturally).  And observational studies can&#x27;t be used to determine causality (did people who skipped breakfast lose weight, or were lighter people more likely to skip breakfast, for example).<p>The study is tiny.  n=36 is right on the cusp of being so small as to not have any kind of statistical significance.  Further, statistical significance is not the same as a significant effect.  The effect size in this study is small.  The n is small.  So how can you use this as the basis for refuting an existing body of evidence?  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  This study does not qualify to invalidate the existing scientific consensus.<p>They did indeed collect body composition data.  Have a look at the following table:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4473164/table/tab03/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4473164/table/ta...</a><p>Now it might just be me, but it looks like what the no-breakfast group lost was fat-free mass.  But then I would have thought the mean for fat-free mass and fat mass should add up to the overall mean for body weight, which it doesn&#x27;t.  So either I&#x27;m missing something or there&#x27;s an error in the table.<p>Finally, check out &quot;researcher degrees of freedom&quot;:<p><a href=""http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/publishing-false-positives/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/publishing-fals...</a><p>Overall, a tiny, weak study, with a single slightly statistically significant result being blown out of all proportion.

How many courses could have (some or all) video lectures recorded beforehand and assigned to watch as homework, thus saving the teacher lecture time and allowing the students who need extra help (and who otherwise would slow the whole class down by interrupting non-video lectures) to visit during office hours, or ask during a smaller lecture Q/A time slot of normal class, and point out exactly what parts of the recorded lecture they struggled to follow? And those who don&#x27;t speak up their questions will get frequent feedback on their misconceptions anyway from the optional tests and determine if they should try harder or just drop the course.",1439362977

I have flavored water (0 calories) and I drink that when I&#x27;m hungry. At noon I eat out. If I have food at home I eat too much so this is the only way that works for me :|",1439362832

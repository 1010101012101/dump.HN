Basically, it should allow one vote on each story for each unique IP, whether you're logged in or not. I hope it's not allowing only one vote total for each non-logged in IP.<p>Maybe I should add a 'beta' tag at the top -- but I'm assuming my target audience wouldn't even know what that was ;)...",1208473079

Seems a bit odd to call that lazy, but I get the gist.<p>On your second point, I guess I would say that ""curious"" might be an odd word.  Some people who are intellectually curious dive into things very thoroughly, so they are likely to be meticulous but also likely to quickly find something else to obsess over.",1208472290

I don't think it'll get there, because I don't think they'll be able to achieve the critical mass of users that Microsoft did with windows.  They've managed to lock in college students-- meanwhile millions of people aged roughly 27+ barely use Facebook, and have little incentive to change their lifestyle to accommodate it.<p>Will Facebook be able to keep hooking college students for 20 years until the older generation becomes irrelevant?  Will Facebook figure out how to get these users somehow?  If they can't answer that then I don't really see it taking off the way everyone says.

Just as cheap lending made homes more expensive, cheap lending can/will/does make tuition more expensive.

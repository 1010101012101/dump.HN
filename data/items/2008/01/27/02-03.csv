Maybe point out that in hockey players are lauded for fighting if the first point doesn't hit home.<p>Sucks that it takes hitting people's pocketbooks to get them to notice that ""hey, maybe we should let some black people drive cars...""",1201401676

104838,comment,104802,104836,0,0,mixmax,,,"If it had been me doing the application (haven't seen it) I would probably build in some ambiguity. It gives a greater degree of freedom for the applicant, and also in the real world you have to deal with ambiguity on a daily basis, so I would like to see how an applicant deals with it.",1201401374

104836,comment,104802,104828,0,0,cperciva,,,"In that case, could I suggest making the question a bit clearer (perhaps s/hacked (.*) system/made $1 system work/ or by giving an example of what you mean)?  The fact that I apparently had exactly what you were looking for, yet wasn't sure if it qualified at all, is I think a good indication that the language is ambiguous.",1201400905
104835,comment,104802,104802,0,0,sanj,,,"Years back, I helped run 6.270, the LEGO Robotics contest.  The winners got a very cool Lego watch.  One of them was a friend of mine.  She was more than a little bummed because the stem on her watch didn't pull out far enough to allow the time to be set.<p>Recalling that an adage that ""even a broken clock is right twice a day"", I suggested she remove the battery.  Then, when the current time was the same as the time on the watch, reinstall the battery.<p>I've never seen her so delighted!",1201400491

104833,comment,104727,104727,0,0,mixmax,,,"I did a start-up some years ago where we were four founders. It was a pretty good match, a technical guru, a marketing guy, a sales guy and me to bind it all together. The sales guy was employed at a fortune 500 company and was managing a sales budget of around 300 mill. $ at an age of thirty. An absolute hotshot. Unfortunately it turned out that he was used to managing large budgets and lots of people, and he simply dragged us down. He couldn't make the transition from a large corporation to a start-up where the rules are very different.<p>It all worked out well in the end - we bought him out and he went back to corporate. And we still have a beer together every now and then.",1201400225

There's two sides to every argument and they should be heard without reducing the argument down to insults or misrepresenting the other side's point of view.<p>On the other hand, I think you're yourself abusing the association fallacy by making a bold assumption that because the article points towards examples of laws with unintended consequences that they also automatically applies to the specific examples you've given. (i.e. opposing the minimum wage doesn't mean you hate the poor, but it equally doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to cause negative unintended consequences as implied)",1201399891

4676728,comment,4676494,4676646,1,0,Zakharov,,,"It comes down to the utility of money, or roughly speaking, how happy the money will make you. $20,000 is a lot more valuable to someone with $10,000 than someone with $50,000. In other words, having $10,000 is worth, say, 10 utility, having $30,000 is worth 20 utility, and having $50,000 is worth 25 utility.<p>Starting with $30,000, buying insurance which has a small chance of saving you $20,000 gives you a +10 utility gain if it pays off. Buying a lottery ticket which has an equal chance of giving you $20,000 gives you a +5 utility gain if it pays off.",1350726488

4676726,comment,4675741,4675936,3,0,ramanujan,,,"This is exactly right. Bureaucrats in general have lifetime employment, so the only check on their power is the press. In this case, they made the colossal mistake of attacking Coursera without thinking through the optics. Most of the people the Minnesota Office of Higher Ed intimidates are not Stanford professors who run internet businesses with millions of visitors and have friends at the New York Times. Usually even a state government has a bigger megaphone than their target; this time they didn't.<p>It's going to be more interesting when the federal Department of Education gets involved. Federal bureaucrats aren't super smart, but they do have smarter people than state government;  when DoE attacks, maybe a few quarters down the road, it will probably approach via the angle of ""widespread plagiarism"" or ""unaccredited institution"" or something that would at least win some supporters in a comment thread. Humanities professors are the big losers in a Coursera world, as they teach classes that are less practically useful and therefore less likely to attract visitors/monetization. They are also more politically connected than their science/engineering peers, and more likely to resort to government when they realize the extent of the threat that online ed poses to their sinecures.<p>I give 50/50 odds of some kind of federal showdown of this nature between Coursera and DoE as the tuition bubble pops and universities start to go bust over the next 5-10 year time frame. The government has a great deal invested in the higher ed system (and vice versa) via Sallie Mae, NIH, and dozens of other vehicles and will strenuously resist disruption.",1350726326
4676725,comment,4668315,4669006,1,0,tripzilch,,,"From what I've read about it--by people who thought long and hard about this issue--the generally most accepted solution seems to be the Wikipedia way: use the name of the language as its written in in the language itself.<p>The reason for the latter is that, say the site is originally presented in Russian, I don't know how ""Dutch"" is written in Russian so I couldn't pick it, but I do know what ""Nederlands"" means (FYI, that's the Dutch word for ""Dutch"", beats me why you English-speakers don't call it ""Netherlandish"", but each to their own I guess ;) which again demonstrates names of the same language in different languages can vary a lot).<p>Though I suppose if you're <i>really</i> tight on space, ISO codes would probably also work.<p>Note that Wikipedia itself is sometimes a rather extreme example; most websites/applications will only offer a choice between a small handful of languages.<p>When the list of languages in the sidebar of Wikipedia is very long, it's not the most user-friendly method of selecting one. On the other hand, with flags that would be much worse, bordering on impossible (while the UK and US flags are pretty unique, there's a couple of flags that are <i>very</i> hard to distinguish from the flag of the Netherlands, for instance).<p>I really wonder if there might be some creative better solution to language-selection than ""the Wikipedia way"", but I really want to stress that <i>using country flags is not that solution</i>, for a variety of usability reasons, political reasons and emotional reasons, most of which are probably outlined somewhere in this discussion so I won't repeat them all.<p>I have to admit I have been guilty of using a German/Dutch/French flag for language selection on a website I developed many years ago--I didn't realize it was a bad idea back then (for instance, the flag of Belgium has the same colours as the flag of Germany in a different order, but they speak Dutch and French there, while the flag of France and the one of the Netherlands differ mainly by a 90 degrees rotation) (and the blues are subtly different, afaik).",1350726265

8861359,comment,8860426,8860426,0,0,lchengify,,,"I would actually go farther and say we should merge the current K-12 into 11 years instead of 13, and make every student complete an associate degree by the age of 18.<p>The current system of K-12, especially in the US, has always been way too padded.  The advent of the internet and readily available educational materials has accelerated this exponentially.  A child born today would be shocked to hear that I learned C++ by driving to a far away building and checking out a dead tree with ink on it.  That same child should be equally shocked that we can&#x27;t expect him to learn actively at home and in the classroom faster than his grandparents did, who had a sliver of the access to information of modern generations.<p>I saw first hand what this could look like.  My parents were not affluent enough to send me to a private school, but they were affluent enough to move to a area in New Jersey with a very well-funded public school system. We had a sister community college that had a great reputation, and as a option for upperclassmen who skipped grades or took courses early, they could drive the community college and take classes instead.  We actually had one student my senior year who got an Associate Degree <i>before</i> his High School degree.<p>Personally I took 2 summer math classes and 2 programming classes at this college, and the difference between the CC and High School was stark.<p>- Professors didn&#x27;t have to babysit: If you acted out, you got kicked out.  No discussion.<p>- You self-selected to other like-minded individuals who were both interested and aggressive about learning the material in the class.<p>- Teachers could actually teach without dealing with school board restrictions or materials.<p>- Funding policies actually made sense since the entity managing them wasn&#x27;t completely government run.<p>- You could treat the students like adults, and not have to worry about discussing controversial material, or that a parent would helicopter in and threaten to sue the school.<p>This whole process made me a lot more excited for college.  It also showed me there was so much more material out there than what I thought about in High School.  I think this process should be funded, and eventually mandatory, otherwise the US will find itself behind.<p>I remember a Star Trek TNG episode (I can&#x27;t recall the number) where a parent was chasing a 10-yo child for skipping class.  The child complained casually that he didn&#x27;t want to learn Calculus.  We may never get that far for every child, but I dream of a world where a brilliant 10-yo could get that far if he wanted to.<p>Part II.<p>To continue my rant, I actually think the Obama Administration is smart in how it is executing on this issue.<p>In the US, the execution of compulsory education happens at the state and local level.  Local governments get to decide how &quot;important&quot; education is to them, specifically with their budgets.  On the plus side, this helps us avoid the (potentially republic-damaging) process of convincing 316 million people that the federal government is the best entity to handle child education (and create a massive bureaucracy to boot).  On the downside, as a country we are dropping the ball in preparing the next generation to be solid competitors in the global marketplace.<p>When this problem last came up it was during the cold war, specifically after Sputnik launched.  There was a massive, national push to make more students in tune with modern education, which resulted in the passing of the National Defense Education Act [1].  Basically, it required a existential crisis in order to motivate the US to seriously fund education nationally.<p>Now, 50 years later, I&#x27;m continually blown away when I discuss education with my colleagues who grew up abroad.  In European (especially ex-soviet bloc) countries, India, and Asia, education is significantly more rigorous and highly valued, which results in a significantly more prepared workforce.<p>I like, or hope, to think that in case the Obama Administration sees the same thing.  Specifically:<p>- We are now 17th in global education ranking [2], and even lower in Math and Science [3]<p>- In the rapidly globalizing economy, this gap in education is now a national security issue<p>- Other up-and-coming economies all have much deeper cultural values for educations, with a national government that reflects it.<p>- Federalizing the system (ala West Wing Season 7) is too drastic, and will never pass congress anyway<p>- Our one massive advantage, our higher education system (which is the envy of the world), specifically the relatively affordable community colleges, is being underutilized.<p>By taking federal funding and pumping it into a solution that is reasonably affordable, partially shared with the states, and bypass the State and local governments, we are essentially doing what educational reformers have always dreamed we could do: Fund education like we do the military.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Education_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Education_Act</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/us-17th-global-education-ranking-finland-south-korea-claim-top-spots-901538"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/us-17th-global-education-ranking-finl...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/pisa-rankings-2013-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/pisa-rankings-2013-12</a>",1420793831

8861348,comment,8860738,8861258,0,0,neilcrj,,,"The tests the teacher is criticizing are standardized summative assessments used to rank, reward and punish students, teachers or both. These usually fail to provide any detailed feedback of instructional value, and frequently aren&#x27;t even scored until students have advanced to the next grade. How do you use an SAT score to diagnose and then help Johnny with his conceptual misunderstanding of the relationship between exponents and logarithms? It is the wrong tool for the job.<p>On the other hand, TDD is formative testing: You iterate over the code until all the tests pass in a structured way. You don&#x27;t fire programmers for writing code that doesn&#x27;t pass all the tests on the first attempt, but deliver actionable feedback at every step. That kind of testing is massively useful in the classroom and teachers practice it with formal and informal assessments all the time.",1420793604

Including the shortcomings of TDD, such as the fact that you pass the unit tests doesn&#x27;t mean you have a working product, which in education translates as students passing tests but not being able to use the subject in real life.<p>You can reduce the delta between passing tests by writing more, better tests, but again you quickly run into a problem - you spend so much time on testing that you start to lose the time to actually learn / write the actual project code.<p>So that&#x27;s some ways in which the analogy is good.  But there are some glaring errors in the analogy.  In education, a student can have perfectly mastered the material, but is just really bad at passing tests, getting stressed out by it. In TDD, you can make your test environment match the target environment very closely.  For most student exams this isn&#x27;t true - most applications of higher learning are not done in a race against the clock, and you always have access to the Internet to help you out when you&#x27;re stuck.  By their nature, tests can&#x27;t validate your capacity to work in a team with any fidelity. So, some of the very important skills that are needed in the application of knowledge are very difficult to test, making tests less valuable as a means of judging a student&#x27;s acquisition of skills.

8861273,comment,8861007,8861236,0,0,techsupporter,,,"Unemployment is not welfare, it is insurance.  Your employer, including the military, pays into a pool.  People who lose their jobs are entitled to draw from that pool.  As you realized, the payments from that pool end after a certain period of time.  Finally, benefits and that length of time vary wildly by state.  For example, Texas unemployment insurance pays a maximum of $465 per week for a maximum of 52 weeks.  The &quot;motivation to get a job&quot; is that benefits will end after a certain time and that time is almost never able to be extended.<p>After unemployment benefits end, you are at the mercy of whatever local social services exist for you.  In virtually all cases, as a result of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, if you are not totally disabled you must be doing something defined as &quot;work,&quot; be it looking for work, going to school, or volunteering at an assigned location.  That only lasts for so long, provided you are not disabled.  At some point, usually between 6 and 9 months, benefits for people who are looking for work and who don&#x27;t qualify for unemployment end.<p>Then there is what is known as the benefits cliff.  Almost all benefit programs have a bright line limit between &quot;qualified&quot; and &quot;not qualified.&quot;  It is some multiple of the federal poverty line based on household size.  If a person or household earns even $1 more than that line, benefits are stopped on that date, even if that is a net loss for the person.  A common example: A single parent can receive a $400 child care subsidy provided total household income is less than $19,000 per year.  The parent makes $18,500 per year ($9.25/hour) and can pay for rent, food, and transportation out of the rest, but the child care subsidy is a definite need.  If the parent works full time and receives a raise of $0.25 per hour, or $500 per year, the child care benefit is immediately forfeit, resulting in a new net expense of $4,300 to the parent.  What incentive is there to then take the raise and for the parent to work to improve?",1420791742

There&#x27;s a lot in here that is really pretty painful to read 14 years on; in particular, I find the argument that you have to start off by using a Unix in order to become a proficient hacker to be particularly disingenuous.<p>The general aspect that I dislike is the idea that there is only one kind of hacker -- the kind that fits into Eric S. Raymond&#x27;s &quot;the hacker culture&quot;.  For instance, he gives the monoculture that all hackers speak English; but just a few weeks ago, we saw an article on HN about the old microcomputers of the Soviet Bloc (I wish I could find the link now).  And, perhaps, maybe my all-time favorite hacks were executed by demosceners who spoke little-to-no English.  Are these people not hackers?  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d find anyone who could argue that, but they are not part of Eric S. Raymond&#x27;s monoculture.<p>The great essay that I have always wanted to read about How to Become a Hacker would be answering the question of how to find joy in the minutiae, and how to put all the little pieces together to make the most interesting things.

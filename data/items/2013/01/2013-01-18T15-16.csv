Which is what you'd be doing without a plea system anyway.<p>The implication here is that things would be the same without a plea system. I disagree. I think that if people regularly faced the kind of sentences that they are threatened with under the plea system, there would be political upheaval. 50 years for trespassing and downloading files? It's absurd.<p>The plea system as it stands is simply a means for prosecutors to acquire more convictions, and it is absolutely unacceptable.

5079229,comment,5078702,5079077,5,0,RyanZAG,,,"Not necessarily true. When you buy a guaranteed annuity, all you are doing is transferring risk (and reward). When you give the insurance company that 100k, they turn around and put it in the stock market. The amount of money they give you is an average of the stock market performance.. plus a very hefty fee to them for their trouble. So what you get out of them is the average stock market return minus that hefty fee.<p>If the stock market performs on average or better than average, you lose by using a guaranteed annuity.<p>If the stock market performs a little worse than expected, you win, and the insurance company will have to pay you out of their profits.<p>If the stock market performs terribly badly, you lose again -- the insurance company has no money to pay you anything.<p>So in 3 of the 4 cases presented here, you lose out by choosing a guaranteed annuity. It's still a solid option, but it's definitely not 'the' option. I personally would never choose such an option.",1358524724

5079224,comment,5078702,5078702,48,0,liber8,,,"MMM has a philosophy that is mathematically sound, and might even work for some people.  Unfortunately, it's proven to fail for just about everyone (the spend less, save more advice has been around since the industrial revolution, and it isn't working to well: the average American has $16k in <i>credit card</i> debt).  The reason it fails is because it ignores basic psychology.<p>The key quote in this article is:<p>>>But simply cutting cable TV and a few lattes would instantly boost their savings to 15%, allowing them to retire 8 years earlier!! Are cable TV and Starbucks worth having two income earners each work an extra eight years for???<<<p>Again, mathematically accurate, but not helpful (pick up any financial ""advice"" in the last 30 years and you will see this exact argument).  Americans are busy.  When most of them get home from work, they want to relax and be entertained.  There's no medium ever invented that does this better than television.  Americans are also rushed.  They want coffee, and buying one at the starbucks next to work is a lot easier and tastier than brewing it yourself.  People firmly believe that these things make their lives appreciably better.  That's why they pay for them.  Telling them to go without is foolhardy.  Yes, they may do it for a bit, but then they slip and get a coffee one morning.  Then they're back to their routine.<p>The insidious problem with this is that it sucks up attention and breeds a mentality of failure.  You've now got this guy constantly worrying about the $20 a week he spends on coffee.  Then, when he inevitably heads to starbucks he thinks he's failed.  ""Man, I can't even stop paying $4 a day for coffee...""  How likely is that guy to focus on things that actually matter, like setting up an automated draw from his checking account into his retirement account?  He's not.  That's one of reasons the average American nearing retirement has less than $100,000 saved.  Its not for lack of education.  People are well aware that cutting expenses and saving more means they can retire earlier.  Its for lack of execution.  People think the path to retirement starts with lattes and cable.  Thats a much bigger daily sacrifice, so people dont even start.<p>Finally, this quote is complete nonsense:<p>>>The most important thing to note is that cutting your spending rate is much more powerful than increasing your income. The reason is that every permanent drop in your spending has a double effect:(1) it increases the amount of money you have left over to save each month, and (2) it permanently decreases the amount youll need every month for the rest of your life.<<<p>Giving up lattes, cable, or any other luxury, is not permanent.  As millions of Americans can attest to, these spending habits nearly always recur.  Its psychologically no different than the people who make new years resolutions to work out, sign up for a gym membership, go three times, and then continue to get fat the remaining 50 weeks of the year.<p>If you want to retire early, focus on the things that will have the largest impact: automate your finances.  Set up a system that automatically deposits a portion of your paycheck into your savings, investment, and retirement accounts.  Automate your investment and retirement accounts to purchase the bond/equity ratios that suit your age (or if youre lazy, just buy lifecycle funds).  Once youve got this down, you should focus on building skills to earn more money.  Your skills, unlike your ability to stay away from lattes, wont diminish over time if you use them.  Or, if youre lazy, then you can focus on cutting lattes and cable.  But good luck with that.",1358524662

5079215,comment,5078702,5078702,1,0,wikwocket,,,"I would disagree with his point that ""cutting your spending rate is much more powerful than increasing your income."" He says this is because it permanently reduces your cost of living, which reduces your required retirement nest egg.<p>But increasing your income has permanent affects too: it increases your net each month, and multiplicatively increases all future earnings. A $3K raise or $10K bump from job-hopping today will bump up all future salaries. And then this trickles into additional retirement savings, and you get more multiplication from investment returns.<p>My point is that, yes, be frugal, but put at <i>least</i> as much time and effort into increasing your income as you do into reducing spending.<p>The other reason is that, you can only reduce spending so much, until you are living on bare essentials. But your potential income is unbounded. :)",1358524594

The ""goal"" is to draw the last dollar from your retirement account on the day that you die (nobody actually believes that, what with passing money to your heirs, your presumably unknown date of death, and at least a small trickle of social security continuing, but that's the theory.)<p>3. Some of the lifestyle changes seem drastic, but you have to remember one thing: you are no longer working. Having complete freedom to do what you want each day is the whole point of retiring early.",1358523400

5078961,comment,5078383,5078383,23,0,ditonal,,,"Well, I'm a nerd but I do agree with the bully. I don't think that the severity of a crime should be judged by a victim's reaction to it. While I see how a suicide might bring notoriety to a problem, I don't think it changes the nature of what was done. It's similar to the Tyler Clementi case, who killed himself because he was being videotaped in gay acts by his roommate. I never thought it was fair that the bully in this case would be held accountable for essentially the entirety of our society's homophobia just because his actions were the final straw. He should have been punished the same that anybody would be for video taping their roommate in a sexual act and publishing it online (which I do recognize as severe bullying and very wrong). I believe that his official charges were along those lines, but it was clear it was being taken more seriously because of the suicide.<p>The other thing I hate is the concept of ""The"" Bully. It's easy to imagine a sick, hateful person, most importantly someone else, and individual bullies certainly exist, but I think the far more common situation is where the bully is a group of people. I think one way to 'Stop Bullying' is to help people understand when they are bullying, instead of just imagining it's something someone else does. I doubt there that many people that never had an adolescent moment where they 'ganged up' on someone (verbally) to feel like they belonged more in a group, or just to give an outsider or a 'runt' of the group a hard time, because it's such an instinctive thing to do. So much so that it's a huge theme of Lord of the Flies, a book everybody reads in high school, but rarely views within the context of their own life.<p>The most ironic thing about these stop bullying campaigns is so very, very often they reflect the same group bullying mentality they purport to be fighting. All these people 'ganging up' on the prosecutors in this case are example of that. I'm not saying this wasn't a failure of our justice system that should be fixed, only that it at times this is seeming awfully like a witch hunt.",1358521731

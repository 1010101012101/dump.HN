I don't know if Plentyoffish qualifies as a Web 2.0 startup, but it is making a lot of cash. I could name a few more.  \nCheers.<p>PS. I agree with the original poster ""The first mistake startups make is they need VC or angel funding to get moving,""  if by ""get moving"" s/he means get started.  You might need it when you want to expand, grow, get serious, etc.  but you don't necessarily need it at the beginning.<p> ",1187279934

Given that, you'd expect these sort of things to happen without any intention on the part of the organizations in question.",1187279891

43048,comment,42933,42936,0,0,zach,,,"Also being in LA, I'd say the major difference is really the access to funding and to deal-making in general.<p>I haven't been looking for funding so much, but I've heard frustrated stories from those who have.  There just isn't the kind of widespread network that includes angels and VCs like there is up north.<p>It is nice to see more non-entertainment-related tech startups in LA, but honestly there's a long way to go.<p>Also, maybe it's just me, but there's still a geographic issue.  It seems like startup activity was split between Santa Monica, Irvine, Pasadena, Encino and Hollywood for the longest time.<p>I think we can say the Santa Monica and west-of-WeHo area has won, at least since Yahoo moved their Overture group to the Santa Monica campus.  About time, but this is just the ground floor.  Funding sources are still spread all around too.",1187279573

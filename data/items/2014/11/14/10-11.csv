8606590,comment,8605847,8606072,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> This was a very public, major lapse in leadership judgment from the CEO.<p>And there may have been others. What bugs me about this whole discussion is that Reddit is not exactly a publicly traded company. If the CEO decides to quit and/or is fired then that&#x27;s a company internal affair and their obligation to explain it to the world stops at &#x27;nothing&#x27;. If <i>both</i> the CEO and a major investor take time out to give an explanation that apparently dove-tails why on earth would we not just believe them and move on. There is absolutely nothing to gain by trying to prove that he left because of some other reason because all the parties involved appear to be in agreement. If they weren&#x27;t then that would be another matter (but it still would not be a productive discussion).",1415962782

8606578,comment,8605847,8606244,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Pouring money into a company more or less requires ever higher valuations otherwise it would be much harder to find future investors.<p>The question then becomes what kind of assumptions underly their businessplan that they use to justify these higher valuations. These can make for very interesting reading, usually they translate into a loose form of: for every &#x27;x&#x27; dollars of investment we can generate &#x27;y&#x27; dollars (usually a multiple of &#x27;x&#x27; ;) ) of turnover keeping the ship afloat long enough to pull in the next round of funding. As long as the funding keeps coming it will look really good to the untrained eye. The real issue of course is what the expected lifetime value is of the customers when taking into account the amount of overhead. If the balance here is close to zero it can become quite hard to distinguish the ultimate losers from the winners. &#x27;At scale&#x27; then becomes the key, if you can&#x27;t make it fly at a small size the theory is that the company will do just fine if you just scale it up drastically while keeping the overhead steady. This is a hard problem.<p>Since Quora&#x27;s investors presumably did financial due diligence before they invested it is safe to assume that the story is a complex one and any variation on the theme mentioned above will be hard to dig up. The degree of desperation with which they try to monetize their traffic is a good indicator about what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes.<p>Barometer: slowly dropping.",1415962424

Do you recall the  famous picture of Escher - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands</a><p>This is an artistic impression of how &quot;body and mind&quot; works, and this notion is as ancient as Vedas, but it does not happen to be expressed in such clever graphical form. Instead, it has been expressed in verbal form, in short snippets across Upanishads and, perhaps, Vedas.<p>This artistic impression also captures fundamental concepts of feed-back loops and recursion, which could explain lots of Nature&#x27;s phenomena, from weather to circuits in your iPhone.<p>&quot;Self-awareness&quot; is just another name for recursion - like &quot;to focus your attention on the contents/state of your consciousness&quot; which could be verbally expressed as &quot;that third eye which is looking inside one&#x27;s own skull&quot;.<p>Btw, you cannot draw that on a tanka, so ancient Indian and then Tibetan artists render it as a eye in the forehead &quot;looking outside&quot;, which, of course, should not be interpreted literally, like so many do.)<p>Technically, these two hands depicts so-called Mutual Recursion where two &quot;processes&quot; are &quot;feeding&quot; each other. This is a crude &quot;high-level&quot; model (a body-mind mutual recursion) of what happened in Yoga.<p>In your quote it has been stated that you should &quot;calm your mind and remove all distractions first&quot; because they are obstacles to Yoga, and then, that &quot;Yoga is that state of unity (within yourself and with the Whole) without any impurities&quot;. So, where shall we start? The answer is - looking at these two hands - it doesn&#x27;t matter. It is a mutual recursion.<p>Extend it with notion of multiple agencies (processes) so it will be n-process mutual recursion, to complex to be grasped by mind at once, like this clever but naive picture.<p>One side note.

It&#x27;s black swan risk. Unlikely to happen, but big when it does.<p>These maneuverings to &quot;reduce risk&quot; are not really reducing the risk fully. Some of what they are doing is aggregating normal risk into long tail risk. Instead of 10% chance of a 10% loss, they turn it into is a 1% chance of a 100% loss. This new 1 in 100 risk is a sort of dark matter that the financial system produces. No one knows where it is and it doesn&#x27;t get fully priced into financial products.

According to what I read on that page, these funds use a combination of derivatives and fixed income to protect the principal. On the &quot;risk factors&quot; part, it says the principal cannot be guaranteed if you get out of the fund early; even if you wait until the end and get back the principal, it won&#x27;t be adjusted for the inflation (6.5%/year and growing); and you always have to pay for the fund administration (1.5%/year for the fund I&#x27;m looking at).<p>Of course, the average return for these kinds of funds will be less than the return for funds which do not guarantee the principal.

What should have been a red flag is the return rate: 1%/month is too high, even more it they are guaranteeing the principal (which should decrease the expected return). High return rates tend to be correlated with higher risk.",1415959887

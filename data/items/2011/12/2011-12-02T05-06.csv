The reasons for this are a similar prion disease in New Guinea has been shown to have a very long asymptomatic period measured in decades. And since there is no screening for prions and no one is sure how long prion diseases remain asymptomatic all Europeans are not allowed to give blood/marrow/organs.<p>* How much so is of course debatable.",1322805559

At least for me.<p>And even in the case I keep X11 running on another vt, I've found that when using no wm, or a simple one like evilwm, switching back and forth from console (on one vt) to X11 (on another vt) many times does not work well.  Eventually it fails.<p>This is on {Net,Free,Open}BSD.<p>I don't think that Plan9 has vt's as such.  It's more like what the article envisions, with graphics capabilities seemingly woven into the terminal.  But you're pretty much stuck in an X11 type environment.  Plan9 experts correct me if I'm wrong.<p>I've always found this ""context switch"" from console to graphics is like a one-way street.  You're not really expected to keep shutting down the graphics and going back to the console.  At least I've never found anyone who does that.",1322805158
3302907,comment,3302088,3302253,5,0,ericd,,,"This doesn't seem like a conspiracy - I recognize a few names that have been in opposition to PIPA from the beginning, and Wyden especially has been great about standing up against these kinds of shenanigans in the past. To be honest, far from being something that I'd accept as better than PIPA, I think it's a fairly well thought out law, and I don't think it's just anchoring talking.<p>That said, I don't think it'll fix the problem, and we'll be at this again in a couple years, since the main problem still isn't fixed - that piracy is still oftentimes the most convenient or only option if you want to watch something specific. The content industry really needs to give up their thinking that they can segment the market at will, and just allow the creation of a single market/repository to watch anything for a reasonable price. When that happens, I think piracy will largely become a fringe activity of little economic consequence.",1322805121

3302903,comment,3302049,3302839,10,0,exDM69,,,"edit: LLVM once stood for ""Low level virtual machine"", but that is no longer the meaning. The early name comes from Chris Lattner's research paper describing an ""ideal machine language"", an intermediate language for compilers which is a little like an Assembly -type language for a virtual machine with infinite registers.<p>The first sentence on the front page of llvm.org pretty much sums it up: ""The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.""<p>It may not be the clearest LLVM description out there, but that's pretty much what it is. If the description had more detail, it would not fit in one sentence.<p>The hard thing about describing LLVM is that it's a huge complicated project in a domain that's outside even many professional programmers' domain.<p>I tend to say that LLVM is (to me) a ""compiler infrastructure"", because I use it to build compiler back ends. However, LLVM is so much more than that, as the project includes loosely coupled tools ranging from complete compilers (clang) to debuggers (lldb) to byte code and binary format introspection utilities (llvm's binutils counterparts). So a ""compiler infrastructure"" or any other dumbed down explanation wouldn't do it justice. That's why the first sentence on the front page is actually pretty good.",1322805065

3302886,comment,3300021,3300021,0,0,billpatrianakos,,,"This discussion has gone south the more people that joined in. There's a lot of people expressing sentiments along the lines of being fearful that they're being tracked and that government agencies are spying on them personally.<p>Let's get something straight. The real issue here isn't that you're being personally spied on. If the government is tracking you specifically and is willing to hold the data they collect on you against you then you should play the lottery too because you're one lucky person.<p>If and when data is collected it is used most often to analyze groups of people, not individuals. It's very rare that an individual would be tracked and that would only happen if you were influential or a true danger to them (at least a perceived danger).<p>For example, let's say the government was tracking Occupy Wall Street protesters. If they were targeting individuals then they'd be targeting the very few ""leaders"" if there are any. Otherwise they'd just like to know about you as a group. What you think, like, listen to, and read. Even so, they're not going to come after you. They're going to use that information in a way that allows them to spin a narrative or in some other subtle way. They just aren't going to bust into your living room.<p>Also, in the rare case they collect data on an individual and actually try to do something to you personally, they sure as hell aren't going to bring it up in a court. You'll be black bagged or something but you're not going to go to trial with the prosecutor coming out saying ""well, we surreptitiously collected this data from John's phone and home computer which proves he's a terrorist"". They'd be shooting themselves in the foot! They'd much rather have you know they collect data while still retaining plausible deniability.<p>You can look up anything you want all day long including how to make bombs and no one will bust in your living room until the day you somehow are in a position to influence a large group of people.<p>So please everyone, let's take off our tinfoil hats, quit thinking we're important enough to track individually, and just generally stop sounding like conspiracy theorists. I mean, this stuff can really do damage and it isn't right but this discussion is heading in the wrong direction with that kind of rhetoric.<p>Edit: Seems everyone doesn't like what I've got to say yet only one person is willing to say why. There's way too much group think and karma policing going on around here.",1322804581

There are the problems with image-based development, external interfacing, cross-implementation differences, unwieldy class libraries, and a bunch of other things.<p>Ruby gets recommended a lot as a modern alternative. It has a very clean syntax and the OOP machinery is closely copied from Smalltalk. By my experience is that while Ruby code at first seems clean and elegant, it turns out to be confusing. The design philosophy is like Perl, have multiple ways to do anything. The larger and more complicated grammar makes it harder to learn. I thought that while regexes and class management were smoothly integrated, many other syntactic features were inconsistent, nonstandard, or ambiguous. In all, there were just too many other things going on to make Ruby a good vehicle for dipping into class-based OOP.<p>Python, also, might be suggested, since Python 3 has made the OOP features more integrated than once was the case. However, Python is a big language, there is a lot to become aware of, and the OOP machinery is not all that close to Smalltalk any more.<p>GNU Smalltalk is what I recommend. It is a straightforward implementation of traditional Smalltalk with one big difference. Instead of being image-based and editable only in the Smalltalk browser environment, GST is text-based. You write code in a text editor as with any other language, though there is also a browser environment available.

These are interesting design features and Io is probably one of the best languages for exploring them, but I'm listing it here as a case of protoype-based object-oriented design.<p>Prototype OOP really was a challenge for this list. Although several prorotype-based languages have been developed, I think only Io and JavaScript have made it into production use. (Unless you count the crippled and long-dead NewtonScript.)<p>So why not JavaScript? Well, ugh, JavaScript is a mess, not just the language, but also the production environments, the documentation, and the user community. In addition to prototypes, JavaScript incorporates the functional paradigm plus a lot of random warts. Developing JavaScript apps for release is a nightmare because of platform differences. Documentation is little help, because even advanced books on JS take the approach that class-based OOP is what you really want, so they focus on how to hammer JS into something that looks like Java. They are many excellent 3rd party libraries, but they either treat JS as a functional language or force it into the class-based mould. So, I'd answer that you can write good prototype-based code in JavaScript, but you really need to be proficient before going in.",1322802824

I find it odd to realize that most men don't observe something that is obvious to every woman I know: that there is a competitive male dynamic to groups that is completely different from the way female groups act. They don't know, of course, because unless the group is overwhelmingly female, the dynamic of any mixed group always defaults to male, with women fading back into supporting conversational roles. Maybe it's the kind of thing you can only observe by contrast to the extremely anti-competitive nature of female groups.<p>The easiest way to put it (and this is hardly original) is that men in groups are focused on their role within the group. Women in groups are focused on the group. Men gain status by standing out from the group; women gain status by submerging themselves into it--by strengthening the group, often at the expense of themselves.<p>Both these styles have advantages and drawbacks.

Although it has a reputation for being hard, experienced ASM coders tell me it's just a matter a familiarity. They claim to be just as productive in ASM as in C.<p>My decision to pass over assembly is because modern processors no longer have a straightforwardly sequential execution model. The image you get from tracing assembly code is only an approximation of what will happen in the processor, which is the same as you can say for C code.

Amit's campaign definitely benefits everyone in the community more or less equally, but the cost to him (determined by the additional opportunities he might have had to find a donor for himself through some other means) are presumably quite low to the point where we can consider them to be zero. Since both cooperators and defectors pay nothing but receive the same benefit, they are equally fit and no relative fraction of strategies employed by the population is preferred (although having more cooperators should contribute to a higher overall payoff).<p>The interesting little twist to the story, if we are thinking in terms of evolutionary game theory, is that players that reach a certain payoff (e.g., by getting there transplant), leave the game with some probability! This is the opposite of what usually happens in games in evolutionary biology, since higher absolute payoff is typically associated with larger population sizes.",1322802331

3302781,comment,3296691,3300181,3,0,secthrowaway,,,"You actually can't handle classified data, or derive something from classified data, that doesn't automatically classify the derived work (a report, or some such) at at least the same level. To not do that risks releasing the information and you can actually end up in prison over it, or at the very least lose your job.<p>So in 99% of the cases it's not like you make a decision to ""classify"" something. It is by its nature classified.<p>Think of it this way. You have a friend that tells you via email a secret. This secret can only be known between you and your friend. For example, you are arranging a surprise party for a third friend.<p>Using this knowledge it is your job to get a birthday cake that has the person's name and age (and a decoration) on it. But the only baker in town is also friends with the birthday friend. You don't want to risk the baker leaking the surprise of the cake to your friend. So you decide to buy a blank cake, and decorate it yourself.<p>This cake is also classified at the same level of the original information (Classified//only between you and your friend). Because it is derived from the knowledge of the birthday party email).<p>Now your friend prints off decorations with some party specific information, say a sign or some streamers or something. Those are also classified at the same level.<p>Suppose there are some other odds and ends that are a result of this email and the party plans. Say a ""making of video"" for the party etc.<p>Now let's say you also hire a clown for the party. You only provide the clown the time and place to come and perform, not any other details. Because the clown isn't in on the original secret, the arrangements for the clown and the various transaction documents pertaining to it are at a lower classification level. You might still not want the birthday friend to know that somebody he knows hired a clown on his birthday (a convenient coincidence) so you swear the clown to secrecy.<p>Even if it gets out and the birthday friend asks the clown directly, the clown has plausible dependability and doesn't know why he was hired, only that he was. So it's not good that your friend finds out, but it doesn't entirely screw up the surprise.<p>I'm stretching the analogy a bit, but hopefully that makes it clear how knowledge of single piece of information (the email that established the surprise party) can end up producing so many classified documents and how that process happens.",1322802225

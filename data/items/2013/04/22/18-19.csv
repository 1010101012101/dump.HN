5591124,comment,5589931,5589931,3,0,whalesalad,,,"A few things that I noticed, just random notes, take 'em with a grain of salt. I'm not running any of the code myself, I'm just browsing around the Github repo. This is a birds-eye analysis. I was a Django developer for a long time and recently went to the dark side and love Rails at the moment.<p>It's important to remember that database connections are a killer in most web apps. This is why a lot of people use connection pooling (in the postgresql world, for example, you have pgbouncer and pgpool). When you can pool and persist connections, you'll have a faster web app (assuming it interfaces with a db, as many of their tests do).<p>Last time I checked, Django does NOT provide built-in connection pooling, whereas Rails does. This could be part of the reason that Rails outperforms in most of the tests. That says something ... but it would be cool to see both frameworks strutting their stuff on an identical connection scenario.<p>Also note that the MySQL connection limit for nodejs is set to 256 connections, whereas Rails set to use a pool of 5. Since these tests are hitting the DB, I'd like to see some more consistency with the way connections are setup. Not that 256 connections is better than 5, but if all those connections are open, it's no wonder that an async framework can hammer the DB so much faster than Ruby chugging along on a pool of 5.<p>In the Node examples, it's important to note the difference between the mysql and mysql-raw tests. And to remember this when comparing to things like Django and Rails which use ORM's like ActiveRecord. In the raw msql test, node is really quick because there is no overhead there for mapping a row to a model.<p>Also, a lot of the viewers of these benchmarks might just look at the big bar for X framework and think, ""fuck it, that's my next project"". Sure, go for it. But also remember that the type of app you're building comes into play a lot. These tests do not have any state. That's why these bare metal frameworks like Gemini are doing so well. Node does great here because it's async. But certain apps (like your future project) isn't going to fit into the mold of an async hello world test. I'm not knocking the framework tests here, they're awesome, but just realize this.<p>One area where Django outperforms Rails is in the realm of JSON serialization. I'm asusming here that Python's native JSON engine is quicker than Ruby's. I learned this with Rails the hard way. With an out-of-the-box Gemfile, you're gonan have a bad time. In Ruby-land there are a few ways to boost your octane here. You start with MultiJSON and then take your pick of the many JSON engines in the world today. MultiJSON being an adaptor that lets developers put the choice of a JSON engine in your hands. Popular ones are yajl-ruby (ruby bindings for yajl, which is C) and oj. If you're doing JRuby, I hear that Jackson is super effing fast so that's nice. I'd love to see the JSON tests with various JSON parsers (at some point these guys are going to get funding for being the benchmark company, having every framework with every possible configuration on display)<p>Django Protip: read up on select_related and prefetch_related. Similarly, in Rails land, you'll want to learn about eager loading with things like includes() and joins(). This will let you do one or few queries up front, rather than doing a bunch of subqueries inside of a big loop. One big query is usually better than a billion tiny ones.<p>A reason why the PHP apps are getting murdered is because in a typical configuration your application initialized on every single request. Opcode caching can help here since that reduces that boot period. This why in a production environment you can modify a PHP file and instantly see the results. Versus (depending on the application) a Ruby or Python app, where the app is booted initially and until that worker or process is restarted, is running the code it started out with. This is for speed. This is also why, for example, a big Rails project (or better yet, a Java project) has a significantly longer warm-up period. It's loading the entire app. This is a big reason the PHP frameworks are suffering here, since they have a lot of overhead to load for each request. Whereas the raw PHP doesn't have that overhead.<p>PHP protip: Roll with opcode caching (APC is a favorite of mine, it's very simple to install and configure, and provides a handy web gui for viewing various details of things like cache hit so you can optimize it). Also, please throw apache and mod_php away if you can and run with Nginx + php_fpm ... although if you're an HN reader then you're probably already doing this.<p>The JVM is balls-quick because, again, unlike something like PHP, it gets booted up and then does it's thing. The JVM is infamous for it's slow startup process (which really varies based on a billion things) but there is a reason for that: the JIT. The slow startup is due to bytecode generation, I believe. It churns that bytecode into machine code and during that process it can make optimizations like unrolling loops. I'm no Java pro though. I don't like working with the language (the verbosity kills me, and XML is painful), but I have an immense deal of respect for its performance.<p>To be honest I am really going to take a solid look at the Play framework for my next side project. It's got a lot of the pragmatism of Rails but it runs on the JVM and comes in a Scala variant. These are things that I am stoked about dipping my toes into.<p>Finally, my hat is off to the folks running these. Great work!",1366657183

5591090,comment,5589931,5590586,2,0,orclev,,,"On the topic of the JVM frameworks, you have to understand that the JVM is a very finely tuned machine at this point, it has something like 10+ years of performance tuning by a large portion of the entire industry behind it. Yesod just recently cracked the 1.0 release and has been going through massive changes in the last year or so, the fact that it performs as well as it does is a huge testament not only to Haskell as a language, but also to the work of Michael Snoyman and the others who's work he incorporated into Yesod.<p>That said, there are still a lot of rough patches with Yesod, and I'm sure there are lots of opportunities to improve performance in various small ways. The main Haskell compiler (ghc) is constantly improving and many of the changes allow for smarter automatic optimizations to be applied by both the compiler and the runtime. With continued refinement I feel it's definitely possible for Yesod to match, and even exceed the performance of any of the JVM based languages, but as I said, there are a lot of performance optimizations baked into the JVM and it's probably going to take a while before Yesod (and WAI which it's built on) have similar levels of optimization in them.",1366656862

Setting up the squid proxy with SSL bump was more difficult than the code, as there are some great libraries out there. Using a reverse proxy and Icap server, you need to parse all content using something like jsoup (regex if you really wanna hack). Jsoup grabs the element and you then run it through a great encryption library like bouncy castle you then add some unique identifiers arounds it (!<i></i>!) so that you can decrypt it using simple parsing to get the encrypted content. Plop it back into the content using your trusty greasy spoon. And walla magic! All persisted data is encrypted. When data is pulled out you simply parse for the unique tag, and then run it through the decryption side. There are a number of things that you can do to increase the security of this implementation, with a  little tweaking it works for searching, and the such, so gmail is no problem. An app like SFDC with joins between records would be significantly more difficult to do properly. Doing it improperly is trivial, as you could just just all of the same keys and IVs per org (the unit of work in SFDC).",1366656431

Twitter, google, facebook, etc this is becoming quite a common phenomenon. In fact the most stable platforms appear to either be outside of the direct control of a single for profit entity, or else an 'add on' feature of a entity highly profitable from another vector.

5591016,comment,5589931,5590760,2,0,bhauer,,,"Hi mdasen.  Thank you for the feedback.  We really appreciate these kinds of thoughtful contributions.  To address some of your concerns:<p>The php-raw test, as with all tests that have the ""raw"" suffix is not using an ORM.  The servlet-raw test uses raw JDBC.  The tests without the ""raw"" suffix are assumed to be using an ORM or something ORM-like.  There is a separate PHP test (named just ""php"") that uses PHP ActiveRecord.<p>To be clear: without the ""raw"" suffix, we expect the test to be exercising the framework's preferred ORM or something analogous to an ORM.  For example, several but not all of the Java tests are using Hibernate.<p>I am of the opinion that it's of great value to include the raw tests alongside the ORM tests for comparison.  Later versions of the results view will allow filtering of the results (e.g., filtering out the ""raw"" tests or filtering out all Java frameworks) [1] [2].<p>Django is being used with MySQL and does not (presently) have a connection pool [3].  We'd gladly accept a pull request that adds a MySQL connection pool.  Separately, we aim to eventually add Postgres tests.<p>As for frameworks that use process-based concurrency, we have attempted to configure each according to the capacity of the hardware.  For example, for a given process-concurrency framework on EC2 large, with two virtual processors, we may use two workers; on i7 with eight HT cores, we may use eight workers.  You can review the configuration details in the repository and submit pull requests if they are wrong.<p>We aim to add server-side statistics capturing in a later round [4].  However, for the time being, I can say that anecdotal observations show that some frameworks do <i>not</i> saturate all CPU cores, but we have not observed any running into out-of-memory situations.<p>Regarding the curious Play1 and Go database test results, see elsewhere in this thread [5].  In both cases, the communities have offered to help address the problems the tests are running into.  The Play community has already fixed the Play1 database test and we expect it to perform in line with Play1 + Siena in Round 4.<p>I agree that testing more components is desirable.  The next test will include some minor work with collections and server-side templates [6].  We have started implementing Test 4 on a few frameworks and have been very pleasantly surprised to see the community has already started submitting implementations in their favorites as well.<p>Thanks again for your detailed thoughts and we look forward to continuously improving this project for as long as we have the time to do so.  Please feel welcome to join in the conversation on any of the Github issues or create new ones.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/152"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/15...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/126"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/12...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=motivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=motivation</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/108"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/10...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5590132"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5590132</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/134"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/13...</a>",1366656180

I've greatly enjoyed building Backbone apps, and I look forward to playing with Ember, but not every web application needs to be rendered client-side against a JSON api.

Some people in the comments look like they could benefit from a better job of it, so here you go:</i><p>After the information was initially leaked, Deutsche Telekom has officially confirmed that they plan to introduce volume restrictions (throttling?) for all landline broadband connections from here on out. Starting May 2nd, the performance specs for all new contracts will include a fixed bandwidth restriction dependent on total upload/download volume. For the time being, the new restrictions won't affect existing customers.<p>Till now, Deutsche Telekom had only ever introduced such stipulations on VDSL (""very-high-bit-rate DSL"") - and fiber-optic connections with download speeds between 25 and 200 Mbps. After reaching a monthly download limit of 400Gb for customers with 200 Mbps connections and 75Gb for customers with up to 16 Mbps, the throttled data rate drops down to a uniform 0.384 Mbps - regardless of previous connection speed. (50 Mbps and 100 Mbps connections, if you're curious, are restricted to 200 and 300 Gb per month, respectively, before throttling.)<p>For now, however, connection throttling, while practical, is not expected to be implemented yet - Deutsche Telekom is merely securing for itself the right to do so.<p>When exactly the implementation will be introduced depends on how ""traffic on the internet grows and develops."" ""As of yet, it's been our expectation that we won't introduce the limitation in a technical manner until 2016,"" said Michael Hagspihl, Director of Marketing at Deutsche Telekom.<p>Once the throttle is actually implemented, customers should still be able to purchase unlimited monthly transfer volume as an ""add-on"" option. But that possibility is not set in stone. The use of IPTV (internet protocol television), Telekom's VOIP communications, and the sharing of connections via ""WLAN To Go"" will not count against the monthly traffic limit. Reason being, according to Deutsche Telekom, that customers pay separately for these services. Civil liberties activists and consumer advocates alike criticize such practices as violations of net neutrality.<p>Deutsche Telekom justifies their move with the ever-growing volume of traffic, which requires continuous development/expansion of their network. A nationwide fiber-optic infrastructure for all of Germany would cost €80 Billion, Deutsche Telekom says. And that's just for residential connections. But bottlenecks develop on the backbone of the network, irrespective of whether DSL or fiber is used on the ""last mile."" Internet connections with higher data rates would only squeeze those bottlenecks even tighter.",1366655597

There are many countries that can only dream of obtaining the data Google has on its citizens.

Regardless, its inconvenient for those who were using the service, and most efforts to put a service on the chopping block have something to do with trying to get more people to migrate to Google+, possibly to collect more data and serve up more ads, a very bizarre synthesis of increasing taxes and surveillance.<p>So maybe Google doesn't want to be a country of the internet.

5590789,comment,5589698,5589698,1,0,danbruc,,,"I see no way this could ever work the way they want and still be secure. They have two conflicting requirements - strongly encrypting the data and not breaking the functionality of third party applications operating on this data, that is making the encryption transparent to a (sub)set of operations (not under their control).<p>It is feasible to strongly encrypt all data but you have to make sure that you do not accidentally implement ECB mode or something similar when using a common block cipher like AES. So you definitely want a unique IV for every piece of data you encrypt. But now you have also broken all server-side functionality because (almost) no useful operation will produce the expected result when operating on encrypted data. Client-side functionality is no problem because it only sees decrypted data.<p>Therefore they (have to) make compromises. Actually the user has to make the compromise - keep some data unencrypted or lose the server-side functionality. This is most prominent in the demos with numeric data that needs to be aggregated, averaged and what not. Actually it would be not to easy to encrypt this numeric data because you have to preserve the format including limits and disallowed values or otherwise the server would reject some values.<p>What about the infamous text fields? They are probably the easiest to encrypt but you still have to be careful not to break validation rules, for example by making the encrypted text much longer or making an e-mail regular upset (but I bet most applications perform only client-side validation). But this again makes the third-parts application a lot less useful because you lost the ability to search in your textual data. The problem to solve is the following one (with some minor details ignored).<p><pre><code>  text.contains(searchText) == encrypt(text).contains(doSomething(searchText))\n</code></pre>\nI - not being a cryptography expert - can not think of a way to get this working without leaking information and CipherCloud's solution as discussed on Stack Exchange definitively leaks a lot of information. This is really a very tough problem. (Probably) not even homomorphic encryption would help because you have no control over the comparison method - it is plain old substring search, maybe case insensitive and that's it. It is solvable using private information retrieval in the relaxed case when you have control over the comparison operation but with substring search it is probably to hard (if you want to keep the cipher text length similar to the plain text length).",1366653955

5590760,comment,5589931,5590586,0,0,mdasen,,,"Because the benchmarks are quite narrow, sometimes you get something that has simply been optimized or isn't doing the same work across platforms.<p>For example, the last time I checked their php-raw code, it was executing a database query and appending the raw results to an array.  Then, it took that array and passed it to json_encode which I'm pretty sure is implemented in C (PHP's built-in functions are in C, yes?).  Anyway, comparing that to something like Rails' ActiveRecord, the work is quite different.  With Rails, it's going to go through and call the accessor methods on the objects to get the data because we often override the default data stored in the database for the representation we want on an object level.  So, they aren't doing the same thing.  Rails at least used to have a way to get back an array of hashes rather than getting the AR objects, but I haven't been able to find it recently.  That could be an interesting comparison.<p>So, in that case, it just isn't the same functionality.<p>Similarly, it's hard to know exactly how they're setting things up.  Django will perform significantly better if you set up something like pgBouncer for connection pooling.  Rails includes connection pooling, IIRC.  Without knowing something like that, it's hard to gauge whether it reflects real-world usage (I mean, I'd argue that defaults matter, but if you're looking to scale Django, this isn't an onerous addition).<p>Similarly, with process-based concurrency, it's important to get settings that maximize CPU usage while not overloading the RAM.  Since they don't talk about memory or CPU usage, it's hard to figure out whether they've dealt with this.  It might be in their repository, but I haven't been able to go through it yet.<p>Heck, the multiple-query test in go seems really odd.  I mean, coming in last place, serving less than half the requests of Rails?  Similarly, Play 1 hits a nice 28% on EC2 and then can't serve a single request on the dedicated hardware.<p>Plus, the tests really stress JSON performance and don't use things like a framework's templating system.  One doesn't need to argue that JSON performance is useful, but so is template performance and that just isn't being tested.<p>So, yeah, it would be hard to make conclusions off of this data except possibly that benchmarking is hard.  None of this comment is meant as a dig against the people doing these benchmarks.  They're improving them, they're making their code open, they're doing the kind of stuff that allows good, open questioning on their results.  But I think it's still early to consider these to be really meaningful.  I think a test that combined a bunch of different types of requests with database access, JSON, templates, etc. would be interesting and it seems like they might go there as they have more time.",1366653623

It's not just about a fluid grid with break points in your CSS to move things around depending on the size of your viewport.<p>It should be much more about how system responds to where, how and why it's being used. That might well mean apapting the layout to fit a smaller device, but equally it could mean things like presenting considered controls to touch devices, offering geo-aware information, changing content to user patterns etc.<p>The term itself is derived from responsive architecture which is defined thus:<p><i>Responsive architectures are those that measure actual environmental conditions (via sensors) to enable buildings to adapt their form, shape, color or character responsively</i>

Muscle memory will allow you to learn the password with only simple characters more quickly but eventually both will be learned. Then the only factor that matters is how accurately the user can type. I don't think muscle memory could ever get 100% accuracy for typing one character correctly. Anything less than 100% and longer passwords will be worse. If you type a key correctly 99.9% of the time then you will lose about twice as much of your time to wrong password entries with an 11 vs 20 char password.",1359727019

You're right, freedom doesn't matter to lots of people in the western world or, for that matter, in China either. Lots of people choose to be powerless or have no desire to be. Lots of people simply fail to see the long-term implications of paying more and more for less and less freedom. If control is one definition of ownership and possession is nine tenths of the law, by giving up even the expectation of control, we are all abdicating ownership for good. ""Good luck with all of the of that."" Berners-Lee is right (and Stallman, etc...). Deliberately and only buying freedom is the only sensible investment; anyone and anything that tries to remove individual (user's) freedoms should be dismissed as absurd, IMHO.",1359726969

I have a fair amount of experience with AWS, but obviously that pales in comparison compared to the experience of the wider HN community, so I would love to get some input.<p>If you could take a moment to answer some of these questions, you will be helping me make the book as useful as possible.<p>- What topics would you like to see in a book about AWS?<p>- Which aspects of AWS have you or your team found most challenging?<p>- Do you have a full-time sysadmin, or do your devs handle sysadmin tasks?<p>- How do you manage the process of deploying updates to your application?<p>- Do you use CloudFormation?<p>- Do you use configuration management tools like Puppet/Chef/etc.? How do you manage configuration updates?<p>- How much time have you invested in reducing your AWS bill? Spot instances? Reserved instances?

5150605,comment,5150326,5150326,1,0,demallien,,,"Not a terribly coherent discourse by Tim B.Lee.  On the one hand, he wants you to run apps downloaded off the internet in your browser.  On the other hand, he wants the user to have root.  There's not even a whelk's chance in a supernova that I will ever run a browser as root.  I assume that Tim's OK with that as a security stance, but it then follows that browser apps can't have root, and if you're a non-tech-savvy user, if your apps don't have root, then <i>you</i> don't have root.<p>Focusing a bit more on the whole root access thing, I think it would be well to remember that we tried the open root thing already, and it turned out to be a security disaster for normal users.  I think it's a good thing that the mainstream computing platforms (Windows, MacOSX, iOS) are trying a new approach.  I also think that it's a very good thing that there are more open solutions, such as Android (which, just to be clear, is also a mainstream choice) and Linux, that allow us to see what can be done with more open access.  Then the closed platforms can see how to go about providing that functionality in a more secure manner for less tech-savvy users.",1359726312

Then tablets came along and provided an identical interface in terms of restricting user access, but the user pays the entire cost up front[1].

I read that phds provide no material advantage and that they're really tough (in every way, including from a psychological standpoint).<p>>you're not confined to becoming a professor at a state school. This is a legitimate fear, and one of the things that has always made me frightened of pursuing a PhD.<p>Confined? Most people don't have this choice. Fear? This a dream of a large % of phd graduates. I'd add one thing that the article doesn't mention: graduate school is far less of a meritocracy than people outside realize. There are so many levels of luck involved, including finding a good advisor, department politics, finding a good project, not having your research 'scooped', funding, etc. These things are correlated with intelligence/ability, but a large number of smart people fail grad school for reasons beyond their control, and a significant % of the people who succeed were blessed with amazing luck. It's the smart and accomplished undergrads (which I take it you are) who have the most to lose.<p>>I'll likely bear little to no fiscal loss.<p>Consider the opportunity cost. Here are some reasonable numbers: a masters costs 25K, a phd pays out 150K over six years, and in the five years of working the masters makes 500K. By the time the phd is out of school the masters student is 325K ahead of the phd student, and his work experience/career is probably further (meaning his salary will probably be at least as high). Also, the masters student lived more comfortably in those five years.<p>> The work will most probably be more interesting than the work I'd be doing had I not done a PhD.<p>I have seen very few industry jobs that require a phd, and I work in a field dominated by phds. The exception is industry research, which is great but isn't open to most phds. Most phds don't be doing anything resembling their research two years out of grad school.<p>I don't mean to make a phd sound totally crappy. There's a lot you can get out of it, it teaches you how to think and organize projects in a way that's hard to find outside grad school. You'll meet smart, motivated people. You'll be able to interact with professors as almost-peers. But consider a research-oriented masters, it's what I did and I consider it a happy medium.",1359725014

Provide a WiFi service that customers in-store would auto-sign into, that way they can tell if a customer visiting the store has been exposed to any mention of the shop online. I imagine only Google or Apple, or maybe Facebook, could do this because of the sheer amount of information they tend to have on peoples browsing history and location tracking ability.",1359723769

Locking Icelanders in rooms and conducting interrogations?  I think the question is a good one.<p>It sounds like the consensus of the responders here is that it is the fact that they are an arm of the US gov't.  So, for example, if the FDA sent somebody to inquire about food processing, say regarding Mad Cow disease, we could also expect that the Icelandic government would be pissed if they weren't in the loop.",1359723657

But when the carriers modify, lock down the phone it's a hassle. It's still a hassle on a perfect phone, out of reach to the vast majority. So on those 98%+ stock (including carrier mods) you have apps that aren't as jailed as on iOS and (still haven't read anything on this either way) pretty much the only online advertiser supplying you this for free.<p>Real world circumstances render this correct ideal view mostly or entirely not true.",1359723620

If you distribute something that dynamically links with the kernel, the GPL applies to you in full force.<p>To the kernel, applications running in userspace are <i>data</i>. They may link with libc to make syscalls, but that just means they throw interrupts that the kernel catches. Your userspace programs aren't derivative works of the kernel any more than your documents are derivative works of the last application you used to edit them.",1256104592

I can't comment on the actual display itself, but the thought of spending $1,300 on something that comes in such a poorly designed faux-futuristic plastic housing is an instant deal-breaker for me.

The HN comments for articles are always much more useful than the articles' local comments.<p>That said, I do use the Brief reader, a Firefox plugin. If I find something extra interesting on HN, I will add it to Brief and follow it for awhile. Almost nothing is spongeworthy enough to stay in Brief more than a month or two.<p>In Brief I currently have:\n- HN (sometimes I read it there, sometimes directly)\n- one local news feed\n- the feed for the Denver Post obituaries (they write interesting stories)\n- a feed from CrossFit\n- about five feeds of steadily diminishing spongeworthiness",1256102519

Despite pretensions to the contrary, DPI has been completely meaningless on the screen for several decades.

It's definitely not for the meek, but adding another directory (and adding an additional metadata lookup) is not the way to go.

I know that quarterly filings are an SEC requirement, but it's at least in part to help shareholders keep abreast of the goings on of the company in which they are part owners.  It seems like completely realtime would overwhelm casual investors, but could provide for much more accurate trade decisions than those made on speculation and the current system of quarterly conference calls.",1256102008

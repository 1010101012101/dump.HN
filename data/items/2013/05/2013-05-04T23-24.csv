There'd be less ""work"" of the traditional, low-productivity, subordinate zombie sense, but a lot more getting done.<p>I want to see BI not because I have an interest in not working. Rather, I want it to free people <i>to work</i>. Work is too important (both as a human need, and as a productive force in society) to leave it in the hands of the entrenched boss men who currently own Work.<p>It would be such an excuse-killer, too, to implement BI and get rid of compulsory labor. People could no longer justify making so little of their lives due to having to work. Now, it turns out to still be quite hard to make something of one's life but, when that excuse is gone, the only thing to say is ""Yes, it's hard; but go on, do it.""<p>Sometimes I wonder, though, if we invented institutional Work to justify mediocrity, and make it OK. It's often portrayed as an oppression brought in by deceptive, aggressive Boss Men; but I also think people willingly participate because it's a way to substitute mediocre/subordinate social acceptance for the much more intermittent reward/thrill of genuine work. Boss men definitely were more principal in driving Work to its current state, but it was a coevolution.",1367711647

5656800,comment,5653879,5656362,1,0,bradleyland,,,"That's a fair enough argument, but the fuel expense figures Tesla uses are far too generous. This is the kind of disingenuous marketing that turns people off. If I go to their True Cost of Ownership page right now, the ""Electricity vs Gasoline"" section defaults to a savings of $261/month.<p>According to Mint, I spend $116.75/month (average) on gasoline. The little graph shows the national average is somewhere between $165 and $220. The graph is small, but the bar is about halfway between. Being generous, that'd put the national average at around $200/month on gas. So Tesla is giving themselves a benefit of around $60 above the national average.<p>It seems like a minor point, but ""fudging the numbers"" doesn't seem consistent with the character that Tesla is trying to build for itself.",1367711639

5656788,comment,5655165,5656587,7,0,epistasis,,,"I would hope that any one person's ""personal experience"" is not taken so seriously that it needs to be quantified.<p>UCSC has switched from teaching Perl to teach Python in intro bioinformatics classes (they get 5-10 new PhD students a year, plus at least that many masters students, I think?). Nobody that I encountered at my postdoc institution used Perl, maybe about 60 people who programmed, and I knew enough of ~20 people's habits to know their programming choices. R, Python, and C/C++ were commonplace, with a few weirdos using Ruby, and of course lots of shell, awk, and sed glue to keep it all together. The Broad has been somewhat successful on shoving Java into people's pipelines with GATK and Picard, but it's not a welcome addition to many people's habits, and I haven't encountered any significantly used project around next gen sequencing that is based in Perl.  For example, in the RNA world, all the common tools like Tophat, Mapsplice, and ChimeraScan all use Python in ways that Perl would have been used 10-15 years ago.<p>I have active collaborations with about five different labs that also have in-house informatics for everything from microarrays, to ChIP-Seq, to RNA-seq, exome to whole-genome resequencing, and nobody uses Perl for any of it.<p>That said, it's really easy to collaborate with lots of informatics people and never even need to know what they use internally. What's this about contracting in bioinformatics? I've never encountered such a thing.",1367711242

We would derive a movement equation for a cannonball, to find the optimal angle to shoot a cannon for maximum travel. Everybody knew the answer of course, but we'd always just used the formula. This time we'd start with the obvious integration equation, movement + attraction between 2 point masses, integrate over flight time, and find the point where it crosses the ground plane.<p>And then the teacher just took the range from the integration, and the formula, multiplied the two and put a ~= sign between them. I believe I actually stood up and said you can't do that and we had the first of many discussions about exactness.<p>That was scary.<p>That was my first run-in with what I considered the central article of my then faith : that you can derive the structure of the physical world from first principles. Throwing away terms in an equation in order to arrive at correct physics laws, I don't know, I considered it sacrilege or something. Of course I've since learned that deriving all of physics from it's own basic laws doesn't work, and the way we fix that is that we delete ""inconvenient"" terms in the equations when required. Deriving physics from a few mathematical laws is completely impossible. You can't even correctly derive the (mathematical) fields used in physics, so the very numbers that one uses to do physics aren't actually valid mathematical numbers.<p>So the relation between physics and mathematics is not that one is based on the other, because that was tried and didn't work out, and people have almost completely given up. So it was replaced by a marriage of convenience (this works ! Sure it won't validate mathematically but the numbers look <i>really</i> similar), ignoring at least a dozen elephants that stood in the way, and we just act like they don't exist.",1367709528

If those people had money they'd spend it on basic necessities and the things they want the most. This in turn will empower those industries to produce more things people actually need, and innovate.

His view was that just giving people unrestricted cash would cut out much of the corruption, inefficiency, and market distortion that creeps in once you start giving intermediaries the power to put conditions and restrictions on support. For example, with food stamps, he was skeptical that the restrictions requiring people to buy ""proper"" food with them produced better results overall than just giving people the equivalent amount in cash and letting them decide. For one thing, if individual recipients are choosing their food, rather than picking it from a list of food-stamp-approved choices, it completely removes the whole business of lobbying to be on the approved list, plus the bureaucracy of administering the list.",1367708492

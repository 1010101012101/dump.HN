Not in the sense that there&#x27;s civil disobedience about small-scale measures, but in the sense that authorities ignore how people feel about it. Even if they disapprove, what exactly are they going to when the government decides to take their cows? Stand by them and let the policemen arrest them? Yeah, that&#x27;s pretty much why they&#x27;re for.<p>Civilian informers were doing just fine at the downfall of every major communist regime in Europe. In fact, their number might have been at a peak (I don&#x27;t have a source to back this for every country, unfortunately), so you could say the complicity of the population was, if not at its highest, at least in a stable, well-paced rhythm.<p>Direct violence played a big role, but only to the extent that it showed the threats of the agents weren&#x27;t hollow. Control over food played a <i>hugely</i> important role in the more rural communities, or those that had deep-rooted education issues; these communities were largely untouched by the lack of freedom which they wouldn&#x27;t have exercised much anyway, but when their ability to satisfy their basic needs degraded, things went awry quite quickly wherever armed control wasn&#x27;t firm and steady enough.<p>The idea that North Koreans, by and large, are fanatical followers of the regime is fiction, especially so late in the development of their regime.",1389866557

7068732,comment,7068579,7068701,9,0,goldenkey,,,"The FLO (Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International) sets a floor price of $1.40 per pound of coffee, which is supposed to be a &quot;higher than market&quot; price, but is actually hardly more than what growers were being paid to begin with. This is like assuring an employee that she will be earning more than the $7.25 minimum wage entitles her to, and then only paying her $7.26 and a lollipop.<p>In many cases, growers can make three or even four times as much per pound if they don&#x27;t sell within their Fair Trade contracts. This is like a Blockbuster clerk being able to earn more cash if he just takes all the videos home and charges admission to his living room.<p>For a nonprofit organization working to combat the exploitation of impoverished countries, the FLO makes a rather tidy sum from licensing fees. For every pound of Fair Trade coffee a retailer sells, they have to pay the FLO 10 cents -- that&#x27;s like Drew Rosenhaus collecting 50 bucks for every Terrell Owens jersey that gets sold (this is hypothetical -- we are well aware that no Terrell Owens jerseys are being sold).<p>In 2009, the FLO had a budget of $10 million, 70 percent of which was funded entirely by those fees. In short, the anti-exploitation organization is using Third World coffee growers to generate revenue, which as you may notice is very nearly the literal definition of exploitation. This has led many in the industry to argue that the FLO exists primarily to market Free Trade coffee, rather than to protect the interests of growers. This is the same relationship that Disney has with children.<p>On average, retailers are charged 65 cents more per pound of Fair Trade coffee. That might not sound like a lot, until you remember how retail markup works. Take a look at the $1.40 that the growers sell their beans for, and compare that to the $9 or $10 you pay for a pound of decent, non-Billy-Bob-Thornton-poop coffee. That&#x27;s a 700 percent increase. If the retailers are being charged 65 cents more on average for that Fair Trade label (almost an additional 50 percent), then you can guarantee that&#x27;s going to mean an additional 300 to 400 percent price increase for you, because retailers need to have a large enough markup to make a worthwhile profit. Otherwise, they&#x27;d just filter day-old coffee from the break room through the manager&#x27;s sock, call it something with &quot;Nicaraguan&quot; or &quot;Colombian&quot; in the name, and sell that to you.",1389866497

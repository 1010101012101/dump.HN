(PV=NRT)\n - What are the equations that describe the energy storage capacity of this capacitor? Please keep the equations as general as possible, allowing for different density gases, voltages, capacitor sizes etc..<p>Design Description:\nA solid conducting sphere is placed within a larger hollow conducting sphere. It is suspended in the center of the larger sphere by a thin conducting rod. Both spheres and the rod are coated with a very good insulator. A charged gas is used to fill the space between the two spheres (for example H+ gas molecules). Since the gas is charged and like charges repel the gas will tend to stay towards the outer edge of the sphere.<p>Charging consists of connecting the capacitors terminals to a voltage source. Electrons will flow into the smaller, inner sphere and out of the larger outer sphere. As a negative charge builds on the inner sphere the H+ ions become attracted towards the center and compressed.  The more charge that builds on the inner sphere the more the gas becomes compressed and the more energy is stored in the electric fields.<p>Alternative designs\nThere are countless alternative designs. I imagine, depending on the application, there are advantages and disadvantages to each. Here is one such example: \nDual Chamber Piezoelectric/Pump: http://imgur.com/UZbJjKB (this design can be implemented with either a piston, or a stationary charge plate.)<p>Bonus Questions:\n - How does the choice of different gases affect the properties of the capacitor? \n - What are the equations describing the piezoelectric and stationary rectangular capacitor?",1440356010

The hope is that by attracting an initial group, the field itself can be improved so that future people like them do not feel excluded.   Carving out a niche for Afropunk may provide a path of entry for musicians create music that would otherwise not be created.<p>Another possible answer is that the goal is not to create &quot;punk for black people&quot;, but to create (or describe) an entirely new genre.   Just as one can have East Coast and West Coast punk scenes, where the participants aren&#x27;t necessarily limited to their geographic origin, perhaps the goal is to have room to allow for specialization.

Did you even read it?<p>&quot;More people will be killed in traffic accidents involving large trucks this year than have died in all of the domestic commercial airline crashes over the past 45 years, if past trends hold true.&quot;<p>&quot;In recent months, Congress has pursued a number of steps to roll back safety improvements ordered by federal regulators. It has pushed to allow truck drivers to work 82 hours a week, up from the current 70 hours over eight days, by eliminating the requirement that drivers take a two-day rest break each week; discouraged the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration from investing in wireless technology designed to improve the monitoring of drivers and their vehicles; and signaled its willingness to allow longer and heavier trucks despite widespread public opposition. Congress also wants to lower the minimum age for drivers of large trucks that are allowed to travel from state to state to 18, from 21.&quot;<p>&quot;The death toll in truck-involved crashes rose 17 percent from 2009 to 2013. Fatalities in truck-involved crashes have risen four years in a row, reaching 3,964 in 2013, the latest data available. Those crashes are killing not only car drivers but also, during 2013 alone, 586 people who were truck drivers or passengers.&quot;<p>&quot;And while a more than 3 percent drop in car deaths over the same period was largely accomplished by technological improvements like airbags, electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes, the trucking industry has resisted most of those safety devices. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the annual cost to the economy of truck and bus crashes to be $99 billion.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s plenty of data in there.<p>> The opinion doesn&#x27;t say anything about private efforts to fix things.<p>&quot;And while a more than 3 percent drop in car deaths over the same period was largely accomplished by technological improvements like airbags, electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes, the trucking industry has resisted most of those safety devices.&quot;<p>&quot;Most automakers now include or offer anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, airbags and collision-avoidance devices in their vehicles, and the technology is included in many of the heavy trucks sold in Europe. But the United States trucking industry has largely avoided using the safety technologies available for vehicles sold here, because of their cost.&quot;<p>&quot;The trucking industry, through its chief trade group, the American Trucking Associations, insists that it needs longer work weeks and bigger vehicles so that more trucks will not be needed on the road, which it says could result in more accidents.&quot;<p>> Now, if that stuff has been tried, and failed, then what have states done? Why do we have to go directly to Federal level?<p>Because the interstates are exactly that: inster-state. The trucking industry isn&#x27;t a problem that affects just a few states. This is clearly not a problem that will be solved by fighting it out individually in each state individually.<p>> Ultimately, we should never give more power to one group unless it really is the only way to do what is needed.<p>I see you&#x27;ve decided to exclude the trucking industry, which holds all the cards in this situation, from your definition of &quot;group&quot;.<p>> No matter how much we trust that group.<p>I don&#x27;t trust the trucking industry at all.<p>>  Thus, whenever someone suggests new regulations, I always question if they are really needed.

The Micron device I&#x27;ve worked with most in designs allows 80 bad blocks per unit at shipment - that&#x27;s about 2% of total blocks. I&#x27;ve never seen a brand new chip with that many bad blocks straight off the bat.

If you want to sell chips, you have to abide by ONFI. If you do that, and your prices are competitive, your products have been just about guaranteed to sell.

When I visited the US (NY and New England area) I found the chlorine taste quite noticeable, also a slight dusty/earthy flavour (I didn&#x27;t complain, and it was a hot summer).<p>However, one of the people we were staying with brought one of those plastic jug/caraffes with a built-in filter (probably charcoal), which she filled with tap water. I <i>really</i> didn&#x27;t expect it to make much of a difference, because how was a tiny filter going to take <i>chlorine</i> molecules (not ions, right?) and that dusty flavour out of the water, that quickly, just by pouring through? (apparently I have no idea how these filters actually work, and a little voice in the back of my head dismissed it as some weird health fad thing)<p>Well, I was taught :-) I was pleasantly surprised when I found that the filtered water tasted &quot;clean&quot;, pretty much just like it tastes back home. But since I really didn&#x27;t expect it to taste much different than straight out of the tap, actually half-expecting the filter might make it a bit more &quot;stale&quot; (assuming it would mostly take out some of the CO2 and O2 gases), I doubt that could be placebo, wouldn&#x27;t you agree?<p>On the other hand, placebo effect can be really weird, in your head, even if you really believe it&#x27;s not affecting you, so I&#x27;m not going to presume there was no placebo going on. I also didn&#x27;t think to try a double-blind test or something, instead happily enjoying the refreshing filtered water during a hot summer :-)",1440354412

A great example of this is Richard Anusziewicz’s painting “Plus Reversed”. Artists use the technique of “equiluminance” to blur outlines and suggest motion. Because of the way our eyes and brains work, humans cannot perceive the edges of objects where object and background have the same luminance.

I just wanted to point out that to me $400k is an enormous amount of money that I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine making in a year, and the cost of living where I live is comparable to where they live. They&#x27;re asking for the equivalent of a single family home on the Prinsengracht or in Kensington and complain that this isn&#x27;t affordable. They&#x27;re expecting too much. You can have a 2 bedroom appartment down town, or a fairly fancy single family home out of town.

Your goal is just to get in the door, even if you think your going to fail at the job.<p>The next thing is networking. You have two projects, do you commit to other projects?

Theres a big assumption that your going to be able to handle yourself on email and chat...<p>Lastly, I hired an engineer who much like you.

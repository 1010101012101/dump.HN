Usually I explain that you may run any OS on your Macbook. Be it OS X, Windows or Linux.<p>ps: For those wondering why I run Linux on a Mac. In my case I tend to develop mostly webapps which need to run on a Linux based setup anyway, so it just makes my life easier to have the environments more or less the same.

For me, the one-time signup fee seems minimal for the value I get from a service that I use nearly every day. I've used many other bookmarking services, some of which have already disappeared like Gnolia. Pinboard is very stable, faster than Delicious, and the developers respond to requests quickly. I have no connection with Pinboard other than as a happy customer, but I regularly recommend the service and think it is worth paying for.<p>I use Pinboard to help collect data for many of my research projects and the archiving capability ($25/ year) is great retrieving pages that have already disappeared, that I want to go back and reference. Yes, I could use other free services and the Internet Archive Wayback Machine (which is amazing), but the speed, support, and reliability of Pinboard make it easily worth the cost.

2017330,comment,2016753,2016974,0,0,btilly,,,"You clearly do not understand economics.<p>When I enter into a trade, the amount of wealth I gain is my utility for the item I am purchasing.  The amount of wealth I lose is my utility for what I'm giving away.  This is true whether we are trading money for goods, or baseball cards for other baseball cards.  Money is just a convenient item that people want which can easily be used to keep score.  But since we each value the item at a different price than the trade, we can both become wealthier when we trade.  It happens all the time.  It happens every time I purchase an apple from the store that the shopkeeper was not willing to eat, but which I am.<p>Let's go back to your example.  In your example the person who spent $80 and was willing to spend $100 winds up $20 off wealthier than they were before.  That $20 can be traded for some other item of sufficiently higher value, so all the money is likely to remain in circulation.<p>There are other people for whom the item was only worth $90.  They are now willing to buy it.  And each one that does winds up $10 wealthier.  That's new wealth spread around the world.<p>The seller, in your example Sony, now winds up benefiting less from each trade.  But they still benefit.  And they get new trades that they wouldn't have made before.  They might or might not wind up wealthier at the new price point.  But even if they become less wealthy, the world as a whole is more wealthy.<p>Incidentally the figures are bigger than you indicate.  According to Sony's stock report for Oct-Dec 2000, they were making $175 in profit per PS2 sold.  I believe that the Xbox got them to drop the retail price by over $100.  At that point Sony was still making a handsome profit.  Just less handsome than it had been.  (And in truth they didn't have to drop it that much, I think they were trying to make the Xbox too expensive for Microsoft to stick it out.  At that price point they made money and Microsoft lost money on every single console sold.)",1292613325

The food protection rules didn't disappear, they just became divorced from accountability to the public.<p>Libertarians (Vint Cerf certainly is one, and corporations generally are as well) pronounce that shifting governance from government to corporations is good.

SICP is an introduction to many of the big ideas in CS: data structures, streams, recursion, interpretation, compilation, register machines, etc., and their implementation in Scheme (a kind of Lisp). It's a great place to start. The next two focus on implementation details like pointers and memory allocation. They are compact, powerful books. The last, Introduction to Algorithms, seems misleadingly titled, as it is fairly comprehensive and used in both undergraduate and graduate courses.

Are you then leaving it to the OS login screen to protect everything? I d rather have passwords I remember in my head. If I forget often, I  click the reset button/forgot your password. Whats more, I generally visit important places more often than unimportant ones, so I wont forget my important passwords. Also, start using sites like mint.com. Instead of logging into your bank account, log into mint to check balance and expenditures.<p>Lets face it, none of this is every gonna keep you totally out of trouble.

The goal was to be able to check which of a set of regular expressions matches a given string, and then invoke PCRE or similar to get the subexpression capture.  The end result:  Django-style regex URL routing against an arbitrary number of expressions, in the same amount of time as routing against a single expression.<p>Of course, I generally never use any of those features except the capture.  (And greedy/nongreedy matching, but that is irrelevant if you're not doing a subexpression capture)",1292612609

I had the opportunity to study one of the aggressive ones very closely in a protective enclosure. How much ever I resolved not to flinch when it lunged at me, I would invariably jump back a pace. The override is just way too strong to control consciously even when you can anticipate it and want to counter it.

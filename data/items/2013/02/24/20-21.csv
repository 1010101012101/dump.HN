Right now, it is very much controlled by the big banks, but that doesn't mean it has to be that way.<p>But that's my point.  As the government gets stronger big businesses put more money and effort into capturing it.  I guess <i>in theory</i> they can be prevented from succeeding, but they always seem to win unless the government is <i>so</i> powerful it can just take whatever it wants.<p>Certainly in the US as Congress slathers on more regulation it only seems to increase the power of the banking industry.",1361739580

5275878,comment,5264635,5272928,1,0,jhuni,,,"> <i>Number theory/abstract algebra, which is the study of natural numbers among other things, is a form of set theory.</i><p>Let S be the set {a,b} and let T be the set {c,d}. There are two bijections S -> T between these two sets {(a,c),(b,d)} and {(a,d), (b,c)}. These two sets are isomorphic to one another because they have the same cardinality.<p>The isomorphism classes of sets are cardinalities which are themselves the natural numbers 0,1,2,3,... and infinity. In combinatorics we can just focus on the study of these isomorphism classes rather then sets themselves.<p>We can enumerate binary relations: ([],[0],[1],[[0 0],[0 0]],[[0 0],[0 1]],[[0 0],[1 0]],[[0 0],[1 1]],[[0 1],[0 0]],[[0 1],[0 1]],[[0 1],[1 0]],[[0 1],[1 1]]). Logical disjunction [[0,1],[1 1]] is equal to 10 in this enumeration.<p>Using the enumeration of binary relations the entire field of study of graph theory can be described in terms of natural numbers without any need for sets. As a result, graph theory is considered to be a branch of combinatorics. We only need to have sets mathematically when dealing with cardinalities like aleph one that emerge from uncountable sets.<p>Since analytic number theory deals with the uncountable set of real numbers and abstract algebra deals with operations on sets including the real numbers, these two fields are indeed founded on set theory. Algebraic combinatorics and combinatorial number theory are the branches of these two fields that focus on countable sets.<p>> <i>And set theory is what mathematics calls type theory.</i><p>No it isn't. Just look up differences of type theory from set theory on wikipedia [1]. You almost never hear the word ""type"" spoken in math courses. According to John Shutt ""I took some tolerably advanced math courses in college and graduate school. One thing I never encountered in any of those courses, nor that-I-recall even in the THUG talks, was a type.  Sets aplenty, but not types"" [2].<p>[1] Type theory differences from set theory <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory#Difference_from_set_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory#Difference_from_set...</a><p>[2] Where do types come from <a href=""http://fexpr.blogspot.com/2011/11/where-do-types-come-from.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fexpr.blogspot.com/2011/11/where-do-types-come-from.h...</a>",1361739462

In Ruby, everything is an object. Objects' only public interface is their methods. These methods don't require a pair of parenthesis to call them, so you can call them as you would access a public variable in other languages. You can easily set up getter/setter methods for an instance variable via an ""attr_accessor :instance_variable"" call within the class definition, or you can define its ""instance_variable"" and ""instance_variable="" methods yourself.<p>This combination of things is I think Ruby's killer feature and makes for a very elegant workflow.

Why write the same code to discover dependencies and to have external build directories and staging directories when we can do it once and have a computer write it out for us. I see it this way Make files are great and reduce you typing at the computer by a factor of 1000. CMake is also great and reduces your typing over make by a factor of 10 to 20.

The US system for the last 200 years discourages multiple concerted voices at the national level. The Swedish system does not guarantee diversity - the Social Democrats held majority power in Sweden for a long time - but your statement is that the US has more diverse politics than Sweden, and I want you to justify your statement.<p>You pointed out, correctly, that there are internal politics as well. How often do you hear from members who self-identify as members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus? Can you name two other caucuses, off the top of your head? Unless you are a politics wonk, I doubt that you'll be able to do so.<p>There's one self-described socialist in national politics. Where are the others? Where are the leftists on the American stage? Why aren't anti-war vegans like Dennis Kucinich in more of the news shows?<p>In any case, there are internal politics in the Swedish parties too, so I don't know what your point is supposed to show.<p>You say that Bill Clinton, Al Sharpton, Zell Miller, Eleanor Smeal, and Ben Nelson are examples of diversity. Neither Sharpton nor Smeal are politicians and Smeal has never run for public office, so you've opened up the field to include a very broad range of politics. Sweden of course also has a broad range of politics, once you get to individual people. There are omnivores and vegans, trans-sexuals and cis-sexuals, believers in 0, 1, or multiple gods, pro-kronor and pro-euro, and every category you mentioned.<p>At some point the US wins just because it has more people, so is your measure of diversity roughly the same as saying that there are more people in the US? I thought you were making something more substantial observation.<p>As for Gus Hall's parents, I again ask how you are sure about what you know. I found no mention that opposition to their political beliefs was a factor. I couldn't even find out when they moved to the US. My strong suspicion is that they, like other Finns during the Great Migration, did so for economic and ethnic reasons. This was the period of Russification, when the Russian government was forcing its language and customs on the Finnish people.<p>This includes the February Manifesto of 1899, which declared that Russian is the official language of administration, only Russian currency was allowed, the Orthodox Russian Church is the church of state, and the Finnish army is conscripted into the Russian imperial army.<p>It's easier for me to assume that his parents, like many others at the time, did so because of improved economic conditions and reduced social oppression in the US, and not specifically because of their political beliefs - beliefs which were also held by many Finns who remained in Finland - were under specific persecution. Can you point me to any evidence that the main reason they left Finland was because their ideas were ""too politically diverse"" for the country?<p>And it's all very odd, because you're using Russian imperialism and oppression from 100 years ago to color your views on Nordic politics now. How does that logic work?<p>I can't help but think that any logic you can come up with would apply even more to the US. The suppression of Communism in the US was done by its own government, at all levels of government, and 50 years more recent than Hall's parents.",1361737470

When I was a PM at Google, there were a couple other critical traits I liked to look for, though they were not simple yes-no criteria.<p>* How does this person deal with vast uncertainty? Are they excited? Scared? Is their first reaction to impose structure or are they comfortable with lack of structure? If it's the latter, can they meaningful convey confidence with the lack of structure?<p>* Can this person teach? Can they figure out how to take an abstract idea and articulate it cleanly? When someone doesn't get it, at what point do they fall back to utilizing authority? Are they good at listening closely to what someone is saying to them and framing an argument in their terms?",1361736113

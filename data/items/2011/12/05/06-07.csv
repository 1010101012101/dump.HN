3313508,comment,3311076,3311676,1,0,buster,,,"No, you don't get it.<p>One question:\nDo you think a Google Search only searches for those keywords without taking other factors in consideration? \nBased on what i can find (checked the source of some plugins of Siri Proxy) Siri is basically just Voice recognition, not ""magic"". You can easily fake ""intelligence"" when binding keywords to actions. Basically google search does the same.\nWhat's the difference? The marketing.<p>I'd say those two and Wolfram Alpha are prime examples of this.<p>A nice example i can show you with Wolfram Alpha.\nAs a marketer i would tell you how supernice and innovative Wolfram Alpha is and that you can talk to it and then show you this:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=How+is+the+weather+in+Berlin+right+now%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=How+is+the+weather+in+B...</a><p>Wow, right? Alphas UNDERSTANDS you! It's awesome, buy it! But:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Don%27t+tell+me+the+weather+of+Berlin+right+now"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Don%27t+tell+me+the+wea...</a><p>Now, that's simple negation that is not understood. It's easy to fix that. It's still not ""intelligence"" or whatever Apple is calling Siri. It's simple keyword based approach. Unless someone proves to me that the iPhone has the computing power of really understanding humans, it's old technology in a new (and great) design with massive marketing. As always.<p>Once you see that, you'll see that voice searching for ""weather Berlin"" and asking ""How is the weather in Berlin?"" is basically the same. The first one is just faster to execute (type or say).\nOnly with the second example you can go all crazy and tell people that you reinvented the whole business.<p>edit:<p>That said, what is wrong with this link is not how Siri works or who is best or whatever. It's the notion of ""Apple was right all along, Google not!!"" which is just stupid seeing for how long Google was investing in Voice Recognition. It never was a matter of who is wrong, both companies invested in this technology. Why does it alyways come down to ""Apple is right"" or ""Apple has invented X and Company Y just copies it!"", it's ridiculous, like the patent law. Let those companies just build and sell their stuff but don't do all this ""Apple was first!"" shit, it rarely is. Most products of most companies are really genuine!",1323068131

At the last minute they backtracked and demanded that since I was from India and the cost of living was much lower, I should charge them around the standard $25/hour.<p>I can never compete in the project game - and I dont want to anymore - because of this attitude by every single US company that I have ever interacted with!<p>I passed them on eventually to a $20/hour company in Delhi, even while I explained to them that none of the coders there had any experience with designing systems that scale.<p>There is also a tendency to feature creep the project since it is only $20/hour which amuses me and is a sure fire recipe for failure.

3313419,comment,3312564,3312564,2,0,dollar,,,"I will tell you like it really is.<p>1.  Say what your product does and why its going to be major in a single sentence within the first 10 seconds of your presentation. With VCs you need to pitch the problem or the opportunity, they do not give a crap about your secret sauce until they understand they are dealing with a big opportunity.  Secret sauce is a second order problem. You have exactly 20 seconds to get their attention before you meet he most arrogant, inattentive, distracted person you have ever encountered.<p>2. If 20 seconds have elapsed, take a look at your VC.  If they are sitting up straight, or leaning on the table attentive, you have them - now GO. Your presentation should be no more than 10 slides, but preferably less than that.  Your slides should be pictorial with as few words as possible.  Words are your worst enemy, they remind the VC of competitors, portfolio companies, analyst reports, VC gossip, and other factors.  Words turn into questions that interrupt the flow of your pitch. If your VC is distracted, looking at their phone, typing away on their iPad, move along quickly because this probably is not going to pan out.  If someone in the room is still not paying attention, walk over and stand behind them while you continue to talk.  That one works every time.<p>3.  Never, ever, yield control of the pitch, you must maintain the flow of the conversation at all times.  YOU are giving the presentation and THEY are your audience.  Let a VC start talking and they will never fucking stop, and 20 minutes later you will be out of time and they will forget who you were and what you were talking about.  Do not let your VC start telling you how it is, YOU tell THEM how it fucking is, get them to shut their mouth for 2 fucking seconds.  This does not mean be rude, this means come fully prepared to ambush your VC when they mean to abush you.  Know your competitors, know their products, know their customers, know their strengths, know their weaknesses.  Be able to explain quickly and succinctly why your product or solution is going to own a particular market segment.  Know your segment, love your segment, explain your segment at length.<p>4.  Never, ever follow up.  Its a complete waste of your time, and it makes you seem like you really need them. If a VC is interested you will know when they call you with next steps. Do not send them an email, do not call them, do not singing telegram them.  Nothing.  Go completely link dead.  If your VC wants your slides, its up to you, but you don't have to give them anything.  Speaking from experience, VCs share these slides with their portfolio companies in addition to their partners, and if its helping their portfolio its probably hurting you. Either way you are giving away your property for free, so I suggest you do not do that. If they want your property, they can cut you a term sheet and the check to go with it.<p>5.  Meet with exactly 3 VCs a week.  If you have not heard from a VC in 2 days, drop them and add a fresh VC.  Never tell a VC the name of another VC you have met with, its none of their business, and its a HUGE disadvantage for you.  VCs all know each other, and if they think someone smarter than them passed on your deal, they are going to pass too.  Similarly, if they think someone smarter than them is interested, they are going to call that someone and try to do talk their way into the deal.  If and when your VC hands you a term sheet, THEN you can disclose who else you are willing to bring to the table.  Use your judgement to gauge VC seriousness.<p>And that is the way it really is.  My advice to you is this:  If there is a way, any remote way, that you can build and launch your product or service without raising venture capital, do it.  Work a job if you have to, work two jobs if you have to.  The VC equation is highly skewed to favor the investor, but you are the person that has to do all of the work, you are the person that is really invested in the business.  To make matters worse, once you accept that term sheet, your investment in your own business becomes subject to the whim of your investors.  You may not understand this now, but you will understand it when you go to raise Series B, Series C, Series D, and find yourself with just 3% of your own company because it took more money than you ever dreamed.  VCs want, no, demand, that you spend their money.  Try telling a VC that you are going to take $3.5M in Series A and stretch it over 3 years as you iterate.  Hell, try telling a VC these days that you want just $3.5M instead of $10M.<p>Good luck.",1323065902

3313391,comment,3312824,3313306,3,0,mjb,,,"> This is nontrivial, but is much easier than scaling your own custom stateful code.<p>Yes, this is an importance piece - and disagrees somewhat with your ""don't think about scaling yet"" point. Probably the most important part of designing for scale is separating the design into stateless, soft-state and durable state pieces. The stateless pieces are trivially easy to scale (with enough money), either by improving efficiency, using bigger machines or using more machines. Soft-state (read caches, write-through caches, etc) are a little bit harder - but still won't need a huge amount of care.<p>The difficult piece is durable state storage (typically a database). When you are just starting out, a big database of everything is probably good enough. Chose a solid, widely used data store (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, Oracle, MSSQL, etc) and use it. Do as little in this layer as you can - it's going to be the most expensive and difficult to scale. Put your business logic elsewhere. Protect it from read spikes with a cache. Design your schemas carefully.<p>Depending on your read/write mix, data volume and the requirements of your application, you can get pretty big (1000s of reads per second, 10s of writes) without any special database hardware or knowledge.<p>Things to remember:<p>1) Avoid tight coupling between stateless and durable state parts of your application. There is nothing wrong with running your DB on the same box as your web server when you are small, but don't write code that assumed that architecture.<p>2) Chose your data model well. Think carefully about the Nouns in your business, and the relationships between those Nouns (much like you would in OO design). Chose the interfaces and relationships between nouns carefully to reduce linkage. Try to keep interfaces clean.<p>3) Measure, don't assume. Your page loads slowly? Don't throw out Apache and replace it with Nginx. Measure what is taking the time, and concentrate on the slow piece. If your actual web server is slowing you down, then change servers. Most often, though, slowness is going to be either in your database or your application code.<p>4) Worry about interfaces, objects and design. Don't worry about technology. The latest buzzwords will not save you from bad design practices - and bigger hardware will only save you for so long.",1323065481

You've got to be able to holistically see the entire application and understand how one part impacts the rest.<p>Only obsessive monitoring can help you there unless you're a little bit savant and can visualise the whole system.<p>When you identify a bottle neck, you re-design and remove it.<p>How to make that easier? I find thinking of large systems in terms of a network of systems that each do ""one thing well"" helps. It makes identifying bottle necks easier as you cannot have doubt where a bottle neck is if a machine (or it's network) is running hot and it really does just a single task.<p>So the only advice I give people in advance of them having pain points is to not mix the use of a part of the system. If you have a database server, make sure that is the only thing that server does.<p>For anyone trying to learn how to scale, the way to scale differs from system to system. Very few people could tell you anything, though a lot of highscalability.com is general enough for web apps that you can build up an arsenal of approaches to common problems and turn to those when you spot bottle necks emerge.<p>Ultimately: you can't learn how to scale until you have to, but you can design your system such that it all does one thing well and is obsessively monitored... at least then when you need to you're in a good place to be able to react to that demand.",1323065345

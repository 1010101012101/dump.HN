When the Afghan intelligence services kill Assange, we'll know how far you can push folks. That'll heat some up more -- maybe enough for things to change.<p>2)I believe the question you are asking me is ""Do you think that some random schmuck on the internet should have the power to decide what remains secret and what doesn't?"" For which I have to say no. As much as I love movies with the underdog and the little guy beating the giant opponent, as much as I love movies where somebody fights the system and wins, I can't support these decisions being made by some guy I never met. To think otherwise seems insane to me -- as I understand it the basic argument would be that <i>things are so bad now that any type of release of docs is good</i>. I'm not ready to go that far. Yet.<p>3) See above<p>Abuse as viewed by whom? Assange? The average 15-year-old internet reader? Oliver Stone? Call me an idiot, but wouldn't you want some kind of orderly process for releasing docs, even if you were for releasing all of them? What kind of half-assed system is this?<p>4) Sure it makes sense. All you have to do is start delegating and telling folks to keep no written records. Presto-chango, your ""secrets"" disappear. No docs, nothing to leak.<p>I think there are a lot of options -- a constitutional amendment comes to mind first. Make it a crime to keep any secrets longer than a certain period of time. All sorts of options there.<p>I feel uncomfortable because the arguers seem to want to push towards either supporting all sorts of crazy secrecy or supporting some system whereby random people email secret information to some asshole overseas who posts it on his website. Surely there has to be some middle ground here. I'd like to get rid of 99.9% of the currently classified documents. I'd like to streamline the intelligence agencies and programs. I'd like to impose criminal penalties on intelligence agencies which abuse their trust by over-classifying information.<p>But fuck-all if I want Assange playing peek-a-boo with national security items -- even if it's .1% of the total. It's wrong on so many levels that it'd take another post to list them all. I am perfectly capable of realizing how bad the problem is without having to cling to Assange as some kind of life-preserver -- the only way to safety. That's not happening.",1280969507

Tens of thousands, many being civilians, have died in Afghanistan; we continue to kill several civilians per day.  We have spent God knows how much money to date on both combined.  They have completely undermined our moral standing in the world.  Those are not potential costs.  Those are the real costs of our military's actions, and I honestly can't imagine how anyone could defend them as being justifiable or reasonable.  Nothing we even dreamed of accomplishing is worth that much.<p>That seems to me like a really big destructive force, and barely anything stands in opposition to it.  It's a lot bigger than 100 Afghan informants who are at risk of retribution.  If anything can put the fear of God into the people responsible for making these decisions, it's worth a huge price, and I think that shining a huge light on the military's actual actions is a pretty good start.<p>Wikileaks fucked up badly, in my opinion, by not redacting identifying details from the documents.

So fear of anarchy is nothing more than a trope. Considering the amount of information marked as secret by the gov't that actually appears to show the gov't in a negative light vs. information of genuine safety for human life, this Wikileaks release is but a drop in the bucket. This emphasizes the canard of ""anarchy"".<p>4- Perhaps the gov't should think long and hard about what it elects to withhold from the public. Assange is not responsible for gov't openness.

Ineffective things don't piss people off and trigger military disinfo campaigns. The author of the WPO blog article is an AEI member, a player in the neocon agenda: not some random pundit.<p>>2) Assange has more power than many 3-star generals<p>I'm fine with that. Assange isn't killing people. 3-star generals are.<p>>3) Anarchy is not the same as openness... Governments can't function without secrets<p>Government can function with much less secrecy than it currently does. WL is serving a public need in challenging a growing regime of secrecy that blossomed under Bush and that Obama has failed to reign in.<p>>4) If Assange wants to play this game, he should think long and hard about where it's going to lead him... If he would rather have millions of little secrets offline and out of sight, that's what we're going to get.<p>Opsec has a cost. The more expensive it is to keep the secrets needed to maintain questionable military practices, the less chance these practices will continue.<p>>There's a certain amount of cocky self-promoting asshole about Assange. As much as I want the maximum amount of liberty, freedom, and openness, this isn't the way to make it happen.<p>I'll take a self-promoter over a murderer any day.",1280966537

If a general solution to an entire problem domain exists (in this case, databases solve the general problem of adding computer representable data to a record) and predates a patented application of that general solution to a specific instance, then the general solution seems like a very good candidate for prior art. At least it seems to stand to reason that applying a general solution to a specific domain can&#x27;t be considered novel. The novel solution is the general one, if it exists. Since the oldest databases have existed much longer than 20 years, it would be impossible for an active patent for a solution within this problem domain to not have prior art.",1406864908

I think the relevant distinction is that when it comes to a safety deposit box, or a storage unit, or an apartment, the landlord no longer has unrestricted access to the unit, and indeed it can be illegal for him to access the unit without your permission. Thus the expectation of privacy is higher than with your friend&#x27;s garage, which he can continue to access whenever he wants without restriction.<p>So it might well be that there is a stronger privacy interest in something like AWS, where Amazon doesn&#x27;t look into your instances, than in other cloud services that look at the data you store in them.

8118249,comment,8117469,8118203,0,0,nickff,,,"&quot;Discontinuities&quot; is incorrect because supply and demand curves are often discrete and almost always non-smooth (due to quantization and many other reasons), but always continuous.  This is partly because of how supply and demand curves are defined, but also because of the reasoning behind them.  Economy-wide supply and demand can be understood as the result of the supply and demand of each participating person; because each person&#x27;s supply and demand curves each have unique properties, they cannot all coincide in a manner so as to produce a discontinuity.  Moreover, if you examine the supply and demand of each individual, there is no discontinuity, as, for example, no sane person would value water at $5/L for <=20L and $4 for >20L (though that may end up being how it is priced for a single person, it does not demonstrate any fundamental discontinuity in the supply or demand, as pricing scheme vary for an infinite number of reasons).<p>With respect to the BMW example, I still stand by it, and I did not  originally mean that BMW represented the entire transportation industry; their fundamental similarity is what is important here.  There is nothing special about he market for water, and using transportation capital goods as a bridge between the water market and the luxury automobile market demonstrates their fundamental similarities well (though I would not suggest flushing a bus down the toilet).",1406863743

Imagine you&#x27;re out in the world one day, grocery shopping, and a guy starts threatening you in the parking lot. In the normal world, you call the police or defend yourself if you need to, or get in your car and drive away. But your options are significantly limited. This problem or situation has other possible outcomes, but society has put artificial constraints the eliminates several effective resolutions.<p>A soldier in war has far fewer constraints. If some guy is bothering them, they can simply kill that person and resolve the issue. Or they can run them over in their armored vehicle, or bayonet them, or beat them with their rifle until they stop moving. An entire world of options opens up that allows you to simply resolve conflicts -- even if these resolutions are frowned upon in the normal society. Society sets up all these lines you can&#x27;t cross, except in war you can cross all over them.<p>There&#x27;s thousands of these kinds of issues in warfare, where normally impossible issues suddenly become trivial. Need to get from point A to point B? Steal a car. Need to get information from a guy? Beat him till he talks. Building in the way? Blow it up.<p>When a solider returns home, suddenly these societal restraints are locked back on them. You&#x27;re suddenly told that you can&#x27;t cross these lines anymore. But as anybody who&#x27;s engaged in <i>any</i> kind of social line crossing can talk about, it&#x27;s hard to roll that back once you&#x27;ve done it. As a result they feel trapped and disempowered. Having previously had literal power over life and death, you&#x27;re suddenly trying to figure out how to fight with a soccer mom and her kids over a parking spot at the mall -- and you&#x27;re trying to keep yourself blocked in by lines you now know aren&#x27;t really there.<p>In combat you could just declare the minivan a threat and open up the 30 cal.

Just because it's the best in several aspects doesn't mean it's the best place to live.<p>And you could be right about the size of a city being a much larger factor in quality of life than easy public transportation. I actually like SF very much, despite the shitty public transportation, and a big part of that is because it's smaller (about a tenth the size of New York) and yet still has high population density (second highest to only New York). My friends in even smaller places like Boulder (a tenth the size of SF) love the lifestyle and startup scene there too.<p>Either way, this conversation seems better suited in person, like the kind you'd have over a beer after a workshop in some other city.",1215970430

245215,comment,244009,244084,0,0,tmarman,,,"The problem that I mentioned in my comment with this is that Nevada's body of precedent is not nearly as well-established as Delaware's, so you're going to pay to litigate otherwise settled issues in Delaware. Often, even if the other state is <i>more</i> founder-friendly, it's often better to use Delaware because you'll save on legal costs across the board (more lawyers able to do DE work, less cost litigating, less question marks and uncertainty).<p>Of course, that varies from state to state and certainly depends on the kind of business and cap structure, where you're doing business, etc.",1215969421
245212,comment,244009,244009,0,0,tmarman,,,"Some excellent discussion above.<p>There are really two decisions to be made here - the choice of entity and the choice of state.<p>Delaware is the choice for two big reasons: it is generally considered one of the most ""founder/board friendly"" venues, and it has one of the well-established bodies of law so you don't pay to litigate issues. Another important side effect is that any lawyer in any state is qualified to validate coprorate structure, whereas in another state you need to find a local lawyer. I wrote a little about this in the past: <a href=""http://bit.ly/31lbT2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/31lbT2</a>.<p>As for choice of entity, well, that's complicated which I went into a little more depth with here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/cIpSL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/cIpSL</a>.<p>S-Corp and LLC are both known as ""pass-through"" entities which as mentioned by cch don't pay tax directly - the members/owners do. This also means that the members/owners can't file their personal taxes until the corporation files its own. This is generally best for closely held companies where you don't want to bring a lot of people on, give options, and you're operating with tax losses (to take advantage of the write-offs on your personal tax). Plus, unlike a C-Corp, you're not double taxed.<p>On the other hand, VCs can't and won't invest in anything but C-Corps (<a href=""http://bit.ly/mKx08"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/mKx08</a>) - so if you're thinking about going this route, it may be better to just do c-corp right away and minimize your legal expenses.<p>My summary in that first article:<p>""If you're actively seeking VC funding (VCs will only invest in C-Corps) and don't anticipate significant tax losses (which is probably the case with many technical startups), then C-Corp is usually a good choice. If you want to take advantage of the pass-through taxation, Imke has a good discussion on choosing between an LLC and an S-Corp.  Partnerships are ok initially, but best avoided given the lack of a liability shield.""",1215969200

245208,comment,244621,245077,0,0,giles_bowkett,,,"No I didn't. That post about New York was stupid too, nowhere near this stupid, but still not particularly impressive. I can't go into detail about every random piece of stupidity I encounter.<p>I can't even read every random piece of stupidity I encounter. Neither this nor the one about New York was worth reading all the way through. I'm a writer, I need to avoid stupidity ""for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers.""<p>I agreed that you were wrong about New York, and I took the effort to conceal my contempt for the post itself because I figured it was the low point and people would move on. Obviously the low point was yet to come!<p>In either case what's more important is the expression of dissent - people on the site are disagreeing with you. They're trying to launch arrows of criticism but the points are so pathetically blunt it's more a feeble attempt at a public stoning than anything else.<p>My hope was the dissent might provoke you to work harder. That nonsense about New York, you wouldn't have wasted anyone's time with that in the ""Hackers & Painters"" days. This site has completely ruined you as a writer, and you used to be pretty fucking good. You too need to avoid stupidity for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers. I bet you read this ridiculous Eric Sink crap all the way through, every last word. Those braincells are dead now and nothing will bring them back.<p>You should kill Hacker News. Revenge for your slaughtered neurons. A favor to those of your readers who actually understand the things you write and don't just read them to kill time after lunch when they should be working. Any site of this nature is inherently, inevitably, built into its design, a magnet for the type of jackass who only reads blogs because if they played Warcraft in the office they wouldn't be able to fool themselves. This site is a diseased mutant doomed from birth. Give it some tranquilizer so it dies in peace, but the minute it loses consciousness, take it out back and CUT OFF ITS HEAD.<p>And before you build the next one, read ""The Wisdom Of Crowds."" Free votes for everyone is a recipe for groupthink factories.<p>Also, the thing about my dog? TOTALLY TRUE. My dog was absolutely smarter than this Eric Sink guy. Probably by orders of magnitude. Eric Sink has gills and lives on a diet of algae, pond scum, and moss.<p>And they're not ""essays"", dude. They're blog posts. It's a good intention to elevate the discourse, but it won't work, because what really elevates the discourse (or lowers it) is the economics of participation. You can call it anything you want but if it's cheap to publish, cheap to link, and everybody has one, then it'll display a very wide range in quality and maturity, and that's just life.<p>I don't know what the hell is wrong with people that this economics of participation thing is so obscure. Vote costs nothing but time? Vote becomes expensive for people with no time and cheap for people with nothing but. Supply and demand.<p>The same thing holds for comments, which is why I made it so personal. I'm going to remember writing it, so you're going to remember reading it. I don't have time for another one.<p>Kill this fucker. KILL IT.",1215968661

245204,comment,244621,245082,0,0,demallien,,,"Yeeesssss, good point - we probably need to define what we mean when we talk about a 'small' ISV.  Eric defines it as being about headcount, whereas you - in labelling these as normal small businesses (and taking into account previous comments by you indicating that ability to scale was what seperates startups from other businesses), would seem to be saying that 'small' ISVs don't scale.  My reply was specifically addressing that perspective.<p>If you actually wanted your comment to be taken as a seperate thing, and not read in conjunction with your other writing, then I guess we don't have anything to talk about - as Eric defines small ISVs, they are effectively... small :-)",1215968508

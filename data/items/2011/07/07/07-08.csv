2737666,comment,2736495,2736621,1,0,tzs,,,"I've been out of California for almost 20 years, so maybe things have changed, but when I lived in Silicon Valley and worked at a small young company I often wondered if it would make sense for small young companies to hop over the mountains to the San Joaquin valley.<p>Suppose, for instance, you were in Merced (as it was 20 years ago--it has changed a lot since then I believe). Not much nightlife or culture, but most of the time you'd be working too hard for that anyway--you'd only have time for the occasional movie and Merced had sufficient movie theaters to get all the major releases.<p>When you could get a weekend off, you'd just drive up to San Francisco and stay for the weekend in a nice hotel.<p>The difference in housing costs between Silicon Valley and Merced were such that even if you were buying a house in Merced, you'd be paying so much less than rent on a decent Silicon Valley apartment that even if you headed up to San Francisco every other weekend for the culture and stayed in an upscale hotel and ate at good restaurants, you'd still come out ahead. For variety, instead of heading up to San Francisco, Yosemite isn't too far from Merced.",1310025572
2737665,comment,2736989,2736989,1,0,fennson,,,"This comment on the site is pretty much spot on:<p><i>If only I could trust you.<p>1) Your marketing text used to claim files were encrypted in a way that made it so even YOU could not see the data.  This was a flat-out lie.  But hey, your false advertising worked, since I trusted that you wouldn't be so unethical as to lie in your promotional materials.  Stupid me.<p>2) You had a massive security failure, and you covered it up.  Sure, some techies heard about it (usually third party) but for the most part, you decided that your customers didn't need to get an email letting them know that this was the sort of problem that happens at your company.<p>3) After you f--ked up with security, Arash didn't even pretend to care until it was obvious that there was massive outrage.<p>4) You edited the ToS so many times in a row that it served mostly as a reminder that your ToS is subject to change on a whim.  So we need to not only trust the agreement as it stands on the website, but we also need to trust some proven liars, as well as all possible future acquirers of your company.  That's... not feasible.<p>Basically, I think you made a great product, but that you have a really lousy and dysfunctional company.  And it's kind of the predictable result of how your company came to be.<p>Maybe you two will be competent management in a few more decades but right now, only a f--king idiot would trust you dishonest ----s.  Fortunately for you, the world is full of idiots.<p>Good luck, and I hope that someday you realize that Arash should never talk to customers (seriously.  never.) and that you'd be well-served to find a way to fire his dishonest, customer-hating, utterly incompetent ass.</i>",1310025555

I think it's all about how well the site caters to their audience.<p>I used to feel that Facebook was just as necessary as Ravelry is to me (I am a knitter) until they started adding so much extra cruft and decided I want to read things like friends' comments on posts written by people I don't even know. So much extraneous information forced into my news feed and into the site in general made me stop using it as often. That doesn't even begin to address how anemic friends lists and such are for addressing how people really interact with the people they know.<p>In that way I'm really loving what I've experienced of Google+ so far. The idea of communicating in circles is so thoroughly baked into the product that it feels effortless to share one thing with, say, my coder friends, and something totally different to my family, without the other group needing to see that stuff.",1310025333

Just had lunch today with a guy I met through a meetup, and it might lead to paying work of some kind if I wanted it. A lot of the stereotypical application process and resume paradigm is all about filtering out and sorting random strangers who ping you across the transom. And it's only a proxy for the thing you want, not the thing you want directly. By going around that, by avoiding it, you avoid a lot of the pain and inefficiency that's experienced on both sides of the table. Go meet people directly. Show them what you're like. Smile. Laugh. Be kind. Don't smell bad. Be efficient. Do good work. Put examples of your stuff out there. Be findable. Be ambient. Increase your ""surface area"" and more opportunities will come to you. And if you're prepared when those opportunities present themselves, and you recognize them, you suddenly experience ""luck"" (where luck = preparation + opportunity.)",1310025016

In the bigger picture, programmers have a meta-algorithm for how they solve problems.  It's tempting to sit down and figure out an O(1) or maybe O(n) algorithm - whatever is the fastest possible - and only then start to program.  In reality, many of these optimizations, especially on a life-scale, can be counter-productive, because the cost of designing, implementing, and maintaining them far outweighs the benefits.  One of the hardest parts of good engineering is true simplicity.<p>So I'd say Knuth's suggested philosophy applies to problem-solving at large, and this is one perspective on the author's epiphany.",1310022786

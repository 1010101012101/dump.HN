But the post mentions that the iCloud password was reset, which means the account may have been hacked via Apple ID security questions[1]<p>When I just did this for my own account, the first security question is your date of birth, which is easy to find for anybody via Facebook. The second was a generic security question.<p>These are easy to guess or to find out via social media. You could spearfish a user by sending them a free account to a web service and asking them the same security questions on registration.<p>The security isn't adequate, considering the data that is held behind an Apple ID. I also can't believe they have a delete feature that can not be undone.<p>For my own account I have done a few things. First I have a secret email address for online accounts that require higher security. These emails are unique for each service and are not published anywhere. I have also removed all of my personal information from my social accounts, such as date of birth, name of school, etc. and my security answers are always random strings.<p>The other option is that malware was used, or a transparent proxy. If iCloud doesn't verify the server certificate it would be straight forward to proxy the HTTPS requests. iCloud will also always send out connection attempts every x minutes, so if you accidentally connect to a public WiFI hotspot or personal network with an intercepting proxy setup, you can have your password stolen in a matter of minutes.<p>I am also not super-confident about two-factor auth. I noticed that with Google Apps the verification SMS messages can be read using the web interface for my telco provider. A web interface that is protected by nothing more than an email address and password with the same weak security questions.<p>I think it is very feasible to hack around second-factor SMS notifications by first hacking the telco provider web interface and reading then deleting the SMS alerts. You are only as secure as the weakest link in the chain.<p>[1] <a href=""https://iforgot.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSiForgot.woa/wa/iforgot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://iforgot.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSiForgot.woa/w...</a>",1344077960

4338146,comment,4337938,4337938,67,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Damn, poor dude. The remote wipe was a pretty big asshole move.<p>I'm pretty curious about the initial break-in on his .mac account. I suspect that either he's misremembering and he has used the password elsewhere (and it was compromised there -- easy to happen over so many years of use), or it wasn't very strong to begin with and it got guessed after a handful of attempts.<p>There are a handful of takeaways from this:<p>- Backups, obviously. A lot of people here so far are mentioning online backup services, but those would be just as vulnerable to this kind of attack, since they're accessible online and use an email account for password resets. Online backup services and physical offline backups solve different problems and it's a good idea to use both.<p>- Since I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else: I wonder if it's time to consider keeping a ""secret"" email account that's only used as the password-reset account for all of your services? Something that you never use for communication, never publish anywhere, something with its own entirely separate password.<p>- Be careful about owning multiple devices from a single vendor that provides remote access and other kinds of control to those devices. Mobile devices are inherently insecure; they shouldn't carry sensitive personal information, ever. There are a lot of really good reasons for going with a single vendor, and remote wipe is a really valuable tool in case of theft, but the downside is ... well, this.<p>- Use some kind of password storage mechanism. (I prefer something that's not tied in to a publicly-accessible service.) I've made a game out of memorizing horrible passwords, and can recall quite a few without any patterns or mnemonics or the like. Still, I use KeePass every day anyway.<p>And maybe most of all: I doubt there's a single one of us that has a moral high horse to ride on this. Everybody always has something better to do than set up a new backup system or dick around with something that will only maybe hurt them someday. I'm constantly harping on other people about backups, but only a couple of days ago got my development machine on our network backup system; I'm pretty anal about passwords, but still I'll panic pretty badly if my laptop is ever stolen, because in there, somewhere, is probably a plain text password stored in a file that I've forgotten about, and there'll be a chance that I'll forget to change that particular password if I find myself having to suddenly change every single password for everything I've got access to.",1344076528

Talking about ""Many Worlds"" paints a picture of parallel universes that one can travel between. That makes no sense, and it is not what Everett says.<p>I was introduced to quantum mechanics from a TCS point of view, i.e. via quantum computing. After some time of getting used to the mathematics, it seemed quite natural to me to suppose that the universe ""really is"" a vector in a Hilbert space, without any spontaneous collapses, and so on. This actually caused me to reject the notion that there are ""Many Worlds"". After all, it's all just components of a single vector describing our universe. It's a single world that just happens to work according to rules that are unintuitive relative to our everyday experience (and the real mystery lies in how consciousness works, but that's a mystery even without QM).<p>So I was <i>really</i> surprised when I found out that what was meant by ""Many Worlds"" is almost exactly how I had interpreted things as well, and to this day it feels to me as if the name as an attempt to popularize this interpretation dilutes a proper understanding.",1344076203

4338135,comment,4334852,4336713,6,0,ballooney,,,"> So why not simulate leaky plumbing? Computer modeling has come a very long way over time.<p>You're not even close! There is no value in nebulous hand-waving statements about 'a long way'- what does that even mean? Did you not read the rest of my message which had very specific examples of how simulation isn't there yet?<p>And as for simulating combustion (when fuel leaks onto a hot pipe, say), academia are only just scratching the surface of simulating things like combustion instability in very toy problems, where they deliberately induce some perturbation x on a flow y and sample they system at some frequency that will just about tell them if there's a limit cycle going on. This is still so far away from actually being able to simulate a burning rocket engine properly.<p>Now of course I must encourage you to stop being so literal. It's not like rocket engineers say 'oh no you can't do simulation with rocket engines, because you can't model leaks properly'. That's preposterous and you're the first person I've ever come across who has inferred it so. What it means is that real actual hardware is very much not like a computer program where you can test something against all inputs and be deterministic about how it will respond because a computer is a comparatively simple, discrete thing. It's a vastly different problem to simulate a rocket engine. This saying speaks to the fact that you can't simulate every paramater of something like a rocket engine - it's just not computationally feasible, and there are plenty of people working on these problems who are familiar with the state of the art of estimation techniques too. It's hard regardless. Oh what I wouldn't give for a real world version of Haskell's QuickCheck!<p>Here's the thing about simulation. It's not, as you might imagine it is, a little local copy of the universe in your pc where you just arrange all the bits at t0 and say 'ok go!' and come back and see that it's worked so your design is fine. Instead you the engineer make the rules and propagate the system through your rules for a bit. If you haven't thought of a scenario, it's unlikely that your simulation will be able to show it. There are not a whole bunch of hidden states.<p>Now you can do universe-in-your-pc type simulation which produces very realistic looking results, but to simulate something as complicated as a rocket in flight would probably take longer than the age of the universe per second. And there are still lots of assumptions there.<p>> You're using a bunch of examples of old failures to imply that new designs will fail in the same way, when the reality is that new designs have the benefit of learning from every single previous failure,<p>This is the sweetest and most endearingly optimistic thing I've read all day. I imagine you ride into work on a unicorn. There's some validity to what you're saying, of course people say 'ok won't try doing it that way' but like with your simulation comment, I think you just don't know the reality of how these things actually work in practice.<p>I promise you there are still lots of Fuel Slosh Failures (an interaction of the control law and the fluid dynamics of the fuel tank causing the failure of Falcon 1 2nd flight) out there in the wild that you don't pick up till you actually fly the damn thing, despite I'm sure very thorough simulated control systems in computers on the ground by people who have a deep understanding of control theory. Static test fires never picked up the pogo effect ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_oscillation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_oscillation</a> ) which blew up a few rockets and caused engine shutdowns in others. None of these are witchcraft, in that engineers perfectly understand them once they've seen them. My point is that you can't come up with them and swat them in advance in every case because there are just too many possible ways things can perniciously interact to cause you problems.<p>Likewise, 'every single previous failure' is not that many in rocketry, because there have not been that many rockets. It's not like rocket X blew up because it's failure mode Y was The Failure Mode for rocket X. Rocket X probably took with it to the grave several other possible failure modes, it was just failure mode Y that got there first.<p>The shuttle flew hundreds of time before that bit of foam broke off and put a hole in the wing's leading edge. We might never know that that particular bit of foam was a Loss of Life waiting to happen if something else had blown up the shuttle sooner. I went to the talk, one of the best talks I've seen in the whole of my career in engineering, by one of the lead investigators of the Columbia disaster. He handed around 2 identical bits of foam, about an inch diameter and 2 inches long. They looked a bit like that dense styrofoam you use in roof insulation. Anyway, these were the insulation foam on the shuttle fuel tank. He then showed us a 200,000fps video of their pneumatic cannon firing these samples at a bit of carbon carbon composite of the sort used in the leading edge of the shuttle wing. The first sample collided and then disintegrated into a cloud of dust, leaving the wing edge unharmed. The second sample collided with the wind edge and punched a huge whole straight through. The whole audience gasped. It turns out the 2nd type of foam was 'trivially' different in some small way, that no one thought would be an issue at design time, but that was the composition of the bit of the foam that broke off and put a hole in the shuttle.<p>Now, that whole audience was an audience of engineers, and we were all shocked. We all knew that if we were asked to simulate it, we'd say 'well, it's a homogenous foam. this kind of density. this kind of young's modulus. this kind of poisson ratio. this kind of hardness. ok that'll do' and simulated with it. But these 2 kinds of foam were basically identical in all these respects, yet their behaviour was vastly and tragically different. Unless you simulate down to the sort of molecular level, simulations just don't show you this stuff.<p>So I understand as an outsider [I am making an assumption that you are from your understanding, apologies if you are not] why you might think that 'surely' simulation 'should' be able to be good enough 'nowadays' what with Moore's Law and MCMC and so on. But really honestly no, not to the point you're going to catch the kind of outliers that cause problems.<p>P.S. I'm not arguing either way on whether or not SpaceX will be safer or not than some marker. I'm sure they'll have among the safest launch vehicles ever flown. But my points so far have been 1) Beware people putting numbers or otherwise strong claims on reliability and 2) I've been trying to kick the tyres of the mental tools and reasoning people from a software background bring to bear when trying to understand things like space hardware. There is a lot more to it.",1344075937

(I love how their solution to comments about going radio silent and not updating their blog in over a year was to just take the blog down and put up a ""The Jungle Disk blog is currently unavailable"" message, as if the blog were just <i>temporarily</i> offline. One of their last blog posts was a ""Future of JungleDisk"" post, outlining tons of features that, 16 months later, were nowhere to be seen).<p>I had been recommending Carbonite to friends and family for an easy-for-normal-people backup solution, but their performance falls short of CrashPlan, and their heinous near-silent default exclusion of video files from backups would have led to serious tears if we had ever actually needed to restore from backup. (Automatic backing up of video files is reserved as a feature for the new $150/yr HomePremier plan - which at least now makes this fact somewhat visible. Previously, there was damn little to indicate that this exclusion was happening). That made Carbonite something much less than the ""set it and forget it"" backup for my non-technical friends and family that it was supposed to be.<p>CrashPlan is nice and friendly, has no hidden ""gotchas"" that I have found yet, and has a great PRO service as well. The client GUI can even be made to connect to the daemon on a headless server through an SSH tunnel, just with a simple change in port number in the config and forwarding the remote port through the tunnel.",1344075065

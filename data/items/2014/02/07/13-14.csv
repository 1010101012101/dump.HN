7196208,comment,7195496,7196168,1,0,einhverfr,,,">  It appears that quite a few folks here do not believe that the right to sexuality is a basic human right. I believe that it is, but I will backpedal and start here:<p>So, to be clear, would you say that human rights are faith-based?  I.e. are they whatever the individual believes they are?  If not, what other basis can they have?<p>> First, the intentions behind the law must be separated from its function.<p>To some extent, yes.  But as I think you are getting at below, you can&#x27;t separate either, really, from enforcement, and I would point out you can&#x27;t separate enforcement from local politics.<p>>  Can gay people now legallly hold hands in public?<p>Given what I know of Russian culture, I doubt that would be seen as gay.<p>> You believe &quot;that a gay rights movement really would be deeply socially disruptive in a really bad way in much of the world (including Russia).&quot;  I believe that any human rights movement concerning religion, race, color, sexuality, gender, class, political affiliation, etc. is always a good thing. It is always good because humans should be treated equally.<p>I think you need to define &quot;treated equally.&quot;  There are plenty of cases where facial equality is in fact not equal at all.  The lack of women as new tech founders is not caused by a lack of facial equality, but due to the differences in how a facially equal culture affects men and women differently.  If you were planning on starting a family within a few years and knew it would cause an earnings hit, would you work long hours with uneven paychecks for uncertain rewards?<p>But let&#x27;s look at specifics.  The problem is intergenerational duties and interests.  Strong intergenerational duties tend to be associated with difficulty remarrying after having kids, retirement with the kids, strong, enforcible interest in who one&#x27;s children may marry, and so forth.  In such an environment, there is no way to have equality because the tool of last resort to overthrow parental opinion (premarital sex resulting in pregnancy) is unavailable to same-sex couples.<p>This means, to have equality you have to:<p>1.  Isolate children from their parents, at least as of adolescence and adulthood.<p>2.  Isolate parents from their children in retirement.<p>These are the things I think would be harmful, in fact so harmful that I don&#x27;t support internationalizing such movements.<p>Now obviously we do both of these things in the US, but most of the world doesn&#x27;t and the question is what right do we have to redefine the <i>parent/child</i> relationship as necessary to give equality on the basis of our notions of sexual orientation.",1391781274

7196203,comment,7195496,7196047,1,0,malkung,,,"> I didn&#x27;t say personal preference, I said preference. It&#x27;s not a choice you make, but it is an orientation.<p>Straight sexual orientation is clearly biological. So it&#x27;s not a question of choice. As far as I can tell, there is no such clear view on homosexuality - i.e. personal choice may be a big factor there. Even if it is largely biological, there are different ways in which a particular culture deals with certain biological functions. E.g., women may have to cover their hair in public in some cultures, while in others not covering their breasts is normal. The same issue is with Russia: open demonstration of your gay orientation is just not acceptable in the <i>Russian culture</i>. The West has to just live with it, in the same manner as it lives with the fact that Muslim women wear headscarves in <i>their home countries</i>.<p>> So I should moderate my reasonable behaviour because you feel awkward explaining it to your kid? Your communication problems mean I shouldn&#x27;t hold hands with or kiss someone of the same gender, in case they see it?<p>Remember, it&#x27;s reasonable in your culture, not in mine.

7196177,comment,7190664,7193377,5,0,clarry,,,"In general, just because you cannot exploit something doesn&#x27;t mean nobody else can.  What to you seems at worst &quot;merely&quot; unexpected behavior is a very good starting point for someone who actually writes exploits.<p>Consider what happens if an attacker controls initlen passed to sdsnewlen() (also via sdsnew() if he controls the initial string).  He can overflow the arithmetic on malloc/calloc.  Now either the memcpy or the NUL-byte assignment can write out of bounds, which is potentially exploitable, especially if the attacker has a nearly unbounded number of attempts (which they often do as far as online-facing services go) or if they can do things to affect the program&#x27;s memory layout -- which they likely can if they&#x27;re feeding the program with data.<p>But if these two aren&#x27;t enough for a successful exploit (I wouldn&#x27;t make any bets!), the initlen is assigned to sh->len (whoops, conversion to signed... and possible overflow), which then can completely throw off the arithmetic in sdsMakeRoomFor.  Here I would actually be quite willing to bet an attacker can arrange these numbers so that he can do a more controlled out-of-bounds write in one of the functions that rely on sdsMakeRoomFor.<p>These two functions aren&#x27;t necessarily the only problematic ones; they&#x27;re just the ones I noticed after a minute of scanning.<p>And I don&#x27;t really agree with what eliteraspberrie said; using the right types is a good start but it&#x27;s absolutely not fine until after you actually do all the overflow checking; for an example of this, see the OpenBSD man page for malloc: <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=malloc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=malloc</a><p>Rule of thumb: whenever you do any arithmetic, ask yourself, can it overflow (how do you know it doesn&#x27;t?) and who&#x27;s in charge of making sure it doesn&#x27;t?  In this case it&#x27;s your API&#x27;s responsibility.  This is exactly the same thing you do whenever you call a function: you need to know if it can fail, and if it can, you need to check the return value and do the right thing.<p>In the years I&#x27;ve spent reading CVEs (and the broken code that caused the alert), proof-of-concept exploits as well as real world exploits, I&#x27;ve learned that some incredibly subtle and seemingly insignificant things can be exploited.  As a general rule, don&#x27;t worry about exploitability, it&#x27;s usually not worth your time to prove one way or another.  Just fix the code whenever you see something that could go wrong.  Make it easy for the next guy who audits your code; so he too can tell that your code is secure, just by seeing the right checks in the right place.<p>If you need a refresher on security issues in C code, I recommend Chapter 6 from The Art of Software Security Assment, made available free of charge by the authors: <a href=""http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/0321444426/samplechapter/Dowd_ch06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/0321444426/samplechapt...</a><p>It&#x27;s a good read for anyone doing C these days, and covers a good deal of problems, including the one discussed here.

Hence, it&#x27;s problematic to pressure those societies to change.<p>Yes.  That&#x27;s a fair characterization.<p>> That seems pretty harsh. Minority rights issues very often involve major social disruptions, and social disruption is often &quot;bad&quot; in its immediate effects -- social violence, strife -- and often has long term effects -- difficult economic shifts and reorganisation as in your description.<p>Minority rights issues are usually borne by groups across generations.  The question at issue here is not but rather is borne by individuals or, at the the largest scale, couples.<p>In other words, if you deprive the Native Americans of land and capital, in 20 generations they will still be in poverty.   Trust that wage labor will lift former slaves out of poverty and a hundred and fifty years later, blacks will be under far more crushing poverty than whites. Almost all of the minority rights issues in the US have been of this kind.<p>And I would add, particularly regarding racial minorities, our treatment of the  issues as individual rights issues instead of problems to be solved by communities and families has been a tremendous part of the problem.  Too bad Sherman didn&#x27;t get his way with his 40 acres and a mule plan.<p>> But where do you draw the line? The same argument would apply -- and, I&#x27;m sure, was made -- referring to a society reliant on slave labor.<p>I guess we should stop looking back at Greece and Rome as great civilizations then, right? ;-)<p>Honestly your question is particularly loaded because although slavery has meant many different things in different places, our national experience was with a particularly bad kind.  I don&#x27;t know that merely calling something slavery would be enough.  I don&#x27;t condemn the Greek or Roman slavery systems even though I do condemn the tarns-continental slave trade bringing Africans to the New World.<p>I think you have to ask how slavery fits into society, what structural protections there are for slaves, what incentives there are for freeing slaves, and how the descendants of freed slaves are treated.  In societies where slavery is a revolving door and descendants of freed slaves are citizens, I might not condemn that.  In a case like the US where descendants were not eligible for citizenship and where slavery was an inter-group, phenomenon with no protections structural or otherwise, yeah I would condemn that, but part of what made that so offensive was the intergroup aspects.  American slavery could not have survived in its form if slavery was used as a way to pay off one&#x27;s own debts for example (as it was in Rome).",1391780189

We have some really talented developers who design some awesome images of what the websites should like. (Hopefully as a photoshop file. Or at least, something that let me get exact measures and layers.)<p>If it&#x27;s a small project, made to be beautiful, they will do the whole design of all the pages. If it&#x27;s a huge Agile project, they would instead give me a style guide.<p>Then, I quickly turn everything into reusable HTML blocks and do the CSS (using LESS). If needed, I&#x27;ll make custom jQuery (or pure Javascript, but that never happens, really) modules for the template. It&#x27;s very quick. A full page templates takes me about 1 to 2 hours, if it&#x27;s very, very complex I may take up to 4 hours.<p>While I&#x27;m working on those, the back-end guys are working of making the CMS work correctly. Sometimes, I give them the templates before they program the page, but most of the time I end up attacking the page after them. I then simply use the building blocks they gave me (and turn all the divs they made into the right HTML5 tags).<p>We use a lot of different CMS and some of the websites have custom backend (no CMS).

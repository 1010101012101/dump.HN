3842221,comment,3840241,3840241,0,0,agent409,,,"I am also a victim of this guy. He harassed me off and on for years. He turned on me after I told him ""no"" when he asked me to do a favor for him I didn't feel comfortable doing. That was all it took to find myself on his shitlist. While we were ""friends"" I got to listen to him brag about all the horrible things he'd done to people, mostly women he dated, after they decided to tell him ""no"" or kick him out of their lives once they realized how crazy he is. He would show me how he was getting so-and-so fired from their job by spoofing emails with child pornography in them to the all@ email aliases of their employers from libraries and hacked DNS servers. He showed me how he made money selling pirated ebooks and sheet music on ebay. And he'd brag about using sockpuppets to build up fake credibility because it's all hearsay on the Internet where the credibility of consensus is only second to hard evidence.<p>Don't fall for this guy's sockpuppet spam. This is exactly the kind of thing he was doing on Kickstarter, and has done on Reddit, Hackernews, here, Rachel's various blogs, and yes, all the way back to the days of Livejournal being the amazing mecca of social networking.<p>His name is Jason Christopher Hughes AKA Michael Nath AKA Thylacine AKA antisense is over 40 years old. He's been at this game for a long, long time and has made social engineering an art form.<p>Most of the posts in here that look like layers of confirmation of ""facts"" about Rachel are all the same person posting through TOR or I2P. If Slashdot admins were to verify the IPs of most of the other posts attacking Rachel, they'll see a wall of TOR and I2P exit nodes, just as any of us who have checked out the logs of his behavior in the past have been able to see. You let this guy brainwash you into believing all his propaganda against Rachel, and you've just weaponized yourself in his favor. Please do not. Keep an open mind. Use your critical thinking skills. Do not allow the emotional shock value of the propaganda to interfere with your thinking. I know it's hard. It's especially hard because Rachel is a very reactionary individual. She has that rockstar vibe to her, and she doesn't take crap from anyone. That makes her an easy target, clearly, because anytime the ""moral high ground"" seems a little shaky, it's a vulnerability in her defense against her cyberstalker.<p>He's been stalking several of us for years. Most of us don't ever talk about him using our typical logins because he'll shit up the administration and our posts until we get banned. He's phenomenally good at turning people against his victims.<p>Unfortunately it's hard to collect evidence against him. He only attacks maybe 10 or so people at a time. He's never going to become a priority for the FBI or local police because they either have bigger fish to fry or don't understand how to handle him in a way that his behavior can be documented. Making all of this public is a big push for all of us who he's been harassing for over a decade. We're tired of it. We want it to end. We need help.<p>Not your personal army and all that, sure, but it would be nice if we weren't alone in trying to bring this guy down.",1334444289

That lets you choose a free (Creative Commons) license for your material. So Commons regularly grabs useful images from there to host. And; we still get people complaining that they didn't understand this meant you could take their image and upload it somewhere else.<p>And this is from a site where the whole point is to upload images.<p>Now lets imagine Ebay implemented this; the idea that most of that sites users would comprehend the extent of a little tick box is, I feel, minimal.<p>I obviously am 100% behind freely licensing content - and do a lot of the sort of work he mentions in getting image/content releases by email. But I also dislike the idea of essentially misleading people and then telling them they have no way to go back on the license (yes, this happens).<p>I might be an outlier here in my criticism. But Commons, in   my experience, tends to treat non-Commons people (especially image copyright owners) like crap. That is what needs to be fixed first, before any pressure is applied to companies like Ebay...",1334444199

It's a serious weakness in non-XML APIs.<p>Full disclosure: I particularly do not like XML-based web services, so please don't misread this as a cheap shot at JSON APIs.

3842213,comment,3841370,3841686,4,0,wolframarnold,,,"Yeah, I would agree strongly. The folks who'll use this are beginners and nothing sucks more than having some weird one-off environment that nobody else uses. I teach a lot of Ruby classes and I always tell people to do things in the most common way. That way, if they need help, the people helping them will feel right at home, and anything the beginners might google themselves will also apply. This is not the case if your one click installer doesn't follow the most common paths. It's convention over configuration, remember?

A merchant is not going to give up 30% of their revenue just to let someone pay with their phone when the same person would also be willing to use their credit card or cash.  However, you can't reach most iOS users by selling in the Android marketplace so if you want access to millions of iPhone users you need to pay for the privilege.<p>See: Amazon's Kindle app for the exception that proves the rule.  Amazon has their own Kindle marketplace where they take a significant cut, they where willing to give Apple a slice of the pie just not 30%.  So they ended up removing in App purchases from their iOS kindle reader.  The back door is you can still use their website from your phone and order a book through them which will show up on all your Kindle readers.<p>However, random App makers don't have the customer leverage to do the same thing.",1334443901

3842190,comment,3841732,3842078,2,0,ewencp,,,"At least on the Twitter web site, they already have the unwrapped URLs -- see the data-expanded-url and data-ultimate-url attributes on links (and, of course, at least one unwrapping is used for displaying the link).<p>They probably don't want to completely undo other shorteners, however, because these services aren't only used for shortening. I absolutely believe it's beneficial for them to have multiple levels of indirection so others can gather stats, I just don't like it as a user who is consuming the links. If the amount of indirection, delay in loading pages, and brittleness of links gets bad enough, maybe it eventually will make sense for them to try harder to avoid it.<p>But they could, in some cases, avoid increasing the amount of indirection and still gather the same stats. For example, on their site, since they open links in a new tab anyway, they could make that link direct and capture the click event with a separate AJAX request in the original Twitter tab.<p>If you focus only on page load latency, other sites/services besides URL shorteners are making things worse. I regularly notice some small delay waiting for my click on a Google result to go through Google's servers since they (annoyingly, in my opinion) swap out the target URL for a wrapped version at the last minute. Of course, Google has other good reasons for doing this as well -- stats and removing referral information immediately come to mind.<p>I also didn't show that this negatively impacts user experience. It could be that t.co, on average, requires so little overhead that the extra level of indirection doesn't matter. But I think it's worth looking into, and if it does have a negative effect, figure out ways to mitigate these effects.",1334443205

In these ten years I've designed and implemented a good deal of industrial software in different segments and never experienced performance problems. Already in 2004, which is ages ago, I designed and implemented a near real time system for distributing telemetry data in F1 racing - among others, Renault won two championships running that system.

After that, it was just a question of watching the evidence pile up.<p>It seems like she went into this without a hypothesis, a (relatively) superficial look at the paintings let her form that hypothesis, and further, more in depth looks at the paintings only confirmed and didnt contradict that hypothesis.<p>That seems like the normal and appropriate process for discovering things like this.<p>Yes, confirmation bias is a problem, but it always is. Thats just how humans work. The mere existence of confirmation bias (which makes it plausible that confirmation bias was at work here) doesnt immediately discredit the results.<p>Im trying to say that confirmation bias might well be a problem here (though the presented evidence seems strong and I personally cant think of good alternative explanations for what she found  but Im also not an art researcher) but that is nearly always the case (when it comes to squishy things like this, Im not necessarily talking about physics, but its certainly also a possibility there). So yeah, you can write Confirmation bias anyone? under a great number of scientific papers, but that alone is not very valuable and constructive.<p>Sometimes the process of discovery itself just cannot be sufficiently protected from confirmation bias (in the sense of excluding any chance of confirmation bias), especially when it comes to something like looking at a painting and trying to figure out its history. Then you have to just roll with it while also being aware that its a huge problem (preferably by going through your evidence with a fine tooth comb, always looking for alternative explanations  better yet, you should get many other people to do that, and I bet they will in this case).",1334443165

Amazon actually pays suppliers much faster than traditional book retailers, making it better for the suppliers.<p>Traditional book retailers pay suppliers 90 days after the book enters inventory whereas Amazon averaged about 58 days. The problem for traditional retailers is they held books in inventory (i.e. the book went unsold) for an average of 167 days versus Amazon's 16 days. This resulted in retailers carrying the cost of the book for ~78 days while Amazon was able to hold the float for ~41 days.<p>The end result of that type of inversion is that Amazon can accept a much lower margin, earn the float on the cash and live off much faster inventory turns than a traditional retailer. This was much more brilliant than ""disintermediation"" - as another poster has correctly noted, Amazon was an aggregator/replacement, not a true disintermediator.",1334442648

There was a single paragraph that stood out on what would become the 214th page of The Power Broker. In it, Bella and Emanuel Moses, Robert's parents, were depicted at their summer lodge at Camp Madison, a camp for poor and immigrant children that Bella had helped found. There, they were leafing through The New York Times one morning in 1926, Caro wrote, when they learned of a $22,000 judgment against their son for illegal appropriations. Caro included a quote from Bella Moses, who was long dead: ""Oh, he never earned a dollar in his life and now we'll have to pay this.""</i><p><i>How, Gottlieb asked Caro, did he get that quote?</i><p><i>Caro told the story. Moses had instructed friends and close associates not to talk to him. Shut out, Caro then drew a series of concentric circles on a piece of paper. In the center, he put Moses. The first circle was his family, the second his friends, the third his acquaintances, and so on. ""As the circles grew outward,"" Caro says, ""there were people who'd only met him once. He wasn't going to be able to get to them all."" Caro started with the widest circle, unearthing, among other things, the attendance rolls and employment records from Camp Madison. Now some four decades later, Caro tracked down, using mostly phone books at the New York Public Library, every now-adult child and every now-retired employee who might offer him some small detail about Robert's relationship with his parents. One of the employees he found was the camp's social worker, Israel Ben Scheiber, who also happened to deliver The New York Times to Bella and Emanuel Moses at their lodge each morning. Scheiber was standing there when Bella had expressed her frustration with her deadbeat son, and he remembered the moment exactly.</i><p><i>""So that's how,"" Caro told Gottlieb.</i><p><i>""Every step of that story is by all ordinary standards insane,"" Gottlieb says today. ""But he didn't say any of it as though it were remarkable. We're dealing with an incredibly productive, wonderful mania.""</i><p>This is why journalists are irritable about ""narrative journalism"", about fudging the facts in the service of some underlying truth. It's also why the difference between ""theater"" and ""journalism"" was so important in Mike Daisey's Apple show.<p><i>He bristles at the word obsessive, his eyes flashing through his thick, dark glasses. ""That implies it's something strange,"" he says. ""This is reporting. This is what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to turn every page.""</i><p>This guy is such a bad-ass.

It certainly works for some people, I think pinterest is the poster child for that. On the other hand there is something to be said for letting users use as much of your app as possible before logging in, e.g. see reddit where they ask for an account only after you try to rate a link or post a comment.<p>If you got users already, then congrats! That means you have data, and with data you can make decisions on how to improve the app. The framework I use to evaluate what to do is based on three factors, UA/virals, retention, and monetization. Let's set aside monetization. I'd look at your metrics and see if where you are weak. If you don't have metrics, then that's the first place to start.<p>For UA/Virals, you want to know what your conversion funnel looks like, for example how many people that land on your app become users, what channels do you get users from, and from there a/b test to make those better. You can also try to have incentivized virals, for instance dropbox gave users more space if they referred a friend. In my world it is inviting the user to get some sort of benefit or unlocking some part of the app. Once you hit upon a strategy that seems like it work, you have to a/b test like crazy because even small changes can have a big impact. If your app monetizes really well, then paid UA can be workable, basically it becomes an arbitrage problem where you try to acquire paying users for a lower cost than they will spend in the app.<p>For retention, you want to know what the second day retention for your app is. If I have over 10% second day retention I find that workable, above 20% is really great. The retention curve seems to be that 14th day retention is about half of second day retention, so if you get 100 users on day 0 and have a 10% 2nd day retention then you can expect to keep 5 users from that cohort 14 days later.<p>To boost retention you could improve your app, but that's usually not the low hanging fruit so to speak. Do you do anything to try an reengage your users, such as sending them welcome emails, or other bacon-y emails. If it is a FB app, do you send app-to-user notifications or post stories on their wall? Basically, you need to find a way to reach out to them and get them to come back to the app. It depends on your comfort level, but I don't mind pissing off 80% of my day 0 users if I can get 20% of them to come back, because without being aggressive hardly anyone will come back anyway.",1334441155

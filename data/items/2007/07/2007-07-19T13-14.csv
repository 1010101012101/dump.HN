35251,comment,35027,35238,0,0,inklesspen,,,"In the sense that a rogue site can pretend to support openid, but actually present a copy of the openid provider's site, yes. People just have to be careful to check the domain name and SSL cert, just like everywhere else.<p>Wordpress.com has an interesting way of handling this; when you use your wordpress.com openid, it doesn't let you log in from the page you get redirected to. You have to manually go to the front page by typing in the address, log in there, and then continue. It's annoying, but probably patches the hole.",1184853142

35248,comment,35062,35062,0,0,staunch,,,"I haven't done anything big with it yet, but it was fairly trivial for me to implement OpenID support. It has the classic chicken and egg problem. Eventually it will be very useful, if we all get behind it. There's certainly no better option for distributed identity.<p>Some may find it interesting to know that OpenID was originally a weekend hack created by Brad Fitzpatrick. Now it's a big deal and even Microsoft has announced strategy around it. Definitely one of the most potent ""hacks to amuse your friends"" that I've ever seen.

He's intense and it seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing and where he wanted Ooma to go in a very Steve Jobs kind of way.<p>I think this has the potential to be quite disruptive to the wireline market.",1184851686

The word name-nesia just came to me and I was pretty sure I had never heard it before. I just coined a word! Well, not so fast. I went to Urban Dictionary, of course, and I'll be damned if it wasn't already there but with a slightly-off definition. That's okay, I added a new one (pending review).

You could theoretically start a company like that overseas but you&#x27;d be doing it with secondhand data, since none of the state agencies would deal with you. It wouldn&#x27;t work very well, you wouldn&#x27;t attract any customers, and you&#x27;d end up fielding lawsuits from the state governments whose data you were borrowing. There&#x27;d be no profit in it.",1388109575

Statements like &quot;As dx gets really really small x+dx/x becomes 1&quot; drove me crazy! Why was it sometimes ok to replace dx with 0!? The idea of an &quot;infinitely&quot; small number to me was always vague and suspect. So while I could do the calculations I never trusted the results.<p>This meant that maths stopped having the same appeal to me as computer programming.<p>It was only years later when I revisited the epsilon delta arguments that it finally made sense.

So it&#x27;s not quite as disconnected as the examples you cited, IHMO. Kinda like drug barons who help kids and poor people in their communities; sure it&#x27;s great for those they help, but it doesn&#x27;t make you forget the dead bodies they are <i>also</i> responsible for. Not just the companies ripped to pieces, consider all the FUD about open source - haven&#x27;t heard that stuff in a while, huh? But imagine if that would actually have taken root; and it wasn&#x27;t for lack of trying, that&#x27;s for sure. Did Microsoft cost the world more than it gives back? How would the world look if what they wanted, they would have gotten? Hard to tell.<p>I do think Gates is aging well, and getting cooler as he does; but it would help if he at least could say &quot;in hindsight, some Microsoft tactics and claims were kinda low, oh well&quot;, instead of going on about how everything is so wonderful and smart and clean, and the past full of hard work and friendly ribbing and nothing else. But to be fair, that seems to be the norm of the industry, and he seems to be less full of it than most. So yeah, good for him, but still let&#x27;s not confuse him with people who spend <i>all</i> their life doing good, or saints.

A run-time type error is one that has real example data.<p>The assumption we can write perfect code immediately and easily, or that a type analysis can just guide us through, is not the case. And it&#x27;s breaks down even worse, when 99% of your code is interacting with systems outside of the scope of the typing system. (database servers, client-side browsers, network connections, file-systems). Dynamically typed language are good fits, when the code is mostly glue-code between multiple systems outside of the scope of any type analysis.<p>But let&#x27;s not equate functional programming with static typing.<p>>in languages that provide a strong theoretic framework for reasoning about code.<p>You act like many of us are ever writing complicated algorithms.

6968965,story,6964369,,1,0,rm82,,,">I think that&#x27;s a broad mischaraterization of functional programming<p>Yes, but it&#x27;s a common one, because its a correct characterization of Haskell and Haskell-derived languages. Functional programming is very popular and used all the time. Consider jQuery, SQL or LINQ. Consider things like Facebook&#x27;s react library. Functional programming is a very usefull tool, in a much larger toolset.<p>But it has a bad reputation by being associated with the language design mess that is Haskell. And here we have a derived language, making it even worse. The problem is not the functional nature of the language. It&#x27;s the syntax rooted in ancient (paper) math combined with lazy evalution, and the illusions perpetuated by their followers.<p>To illustrate just how far anti-human this Haskell dialect is: <i></i>it uses greek symbols!<i></i>. This alone excludes 99.99% of the world population. The majority of the world population will not be able to even phrase the question &quot;what does that symbol mean&quot; without pointing to a screenshot. We don&#x27;t calculate the speed of a space rocket using horse power, and we shouldn&#x27;t encourage anyone introducing greek symbols into a programming language that is intented to me more than esoteric.<p>Haskell and haskell derived languages are and will continue to fail to become mainstream, because:<p>- <i></i>they were not designed with that goal in mind<i></i> (actual statements of the language designers)<p>- <i></i>the syntax isn&#x27;t optimized to limit the cognitive load of actual real world use-cases.<i></i> Instead, it&#x27;s optimized to make a fibonacci function look as much like ancient math as possible. Has anyone ever been paid to code that function? No. Is this function particularly difficult to implement in other languages? No.<p>- <i></i>they pretend computers don&#x27;t exist<i></i>. Haskell implementations have operational semantics: they are just under-specified, unpredictable and implementation-specific.  Performance and scalablility don&#x27;t need to be good; they need to be predictable by a human. The algorithmic complexitiy of any operation, should not became a secret hidden behind a curtain of mystery.<p>- <i></i>it fails the main challange of large scale software development: coordination state mutations<i></i> We need standardisation and normalisation of state. Yet by making all state explicit arguments, and being all religious about it, you end with a zillion competing ways to structure and reflect on the state. Knee-deep in monad transformers that convert one type of state to some other type of state, one has to wonder: is it so bad that most programming languages just wrap every computation is one standarized state-monad? No! That&#x27;s actually a good thing. Let&#x27;s not pretend that encapsulation of state, can only be done functionally.<p>- The cult surrounding it keeps propagating misconceptions about the nature of computation itself. Take your comment for example:<p>>Ultimately, functional programming lets you talk about what where imperative languages force you to talk about how.<p>This not true. Functional programming does not let you talk about the what. Haskell definately doesn&#x27;t let you just talk about the what. If i put &quot;e = m * c&quot; into haskell, i won&#x27;t suddenly get m, given an e. Just because the operational semantics of Haskell are under-specified and incomprehensible by anyone without an academic background, doesn&#x27;t mean there is no operational semantics. <i></i>At it&#x27;s core, it&#x27;s just a term rewriter with a lot of fine print, that nobody bothered to properly document, and which is far from intuitive.<i></i><p>>even concepts like mutable variables and loops are not particularity intuitive.<p>Correct. But combined with term rewriting, dataflow and logic programming, and a bunch of other paradigms the best tools we&#x27;ve got to deal with a wide scenario of our real world use-cases.<p>Functional programming is doing fine. Static type analysis is a great tool and many use it often, but few if any are using it exclusively, because it is the enemy of exploration: A run-time type error, is one that carries real example data!<p><i></i>But lazy evaluation, underspecified and unpredictable operational semantics, and foreign alphabets means that the the average can&#x27;t even verbalize the question you guys don&#x27;t the answer to.<i></i>",1388107559

6968921,story,6964369,,1,0,rm82,,,">I think that&#x27;s a broad mischaraterization of functional programming<p>Yes, but it&#x27;s a common one, because its a correct characterization of Haskell and Haskell-derived languages.<p>Functional programming is very popular and used all the time. Consider jQuery, SQL or LINQ. Consider things like Facebook&#x27;s react library. Functional programming is a very usefull tool, in a much larger toolset.<p>But it has a bad reputation by being associated with the language design mess that is Haskell. And here we have a derived language, making it even worse.<p>The problem is not the functional nature of the language. It&#x27;s the syntax rooted in ancient (paper) math combined with lazy evalution, and the illusions perpetuated by their followers.<p>To illustrate just how far anti-human this Haskell dialect is: _it uses greek symbols_. This alone excludes 99.99% of the world population.<p>Yet, the language designer&#x27;s intent is for this to &#x27;cure programming&#x27;. To improve things. Yes, what computer science needs is more symbols, that aren&#x27;t even on our keyboards. Symbols a majority of the world doesn&#x27;t even know how to pronounce.<p>To ask the question &quot;what does that lambda symbol mean?&quot; one would have to make a screenshot and mark it. A new student having to learn the language, lacks both the ability to verbalize, as well as type, the symbol. How out of reach with reality can one be to suggest this would ever become mainstream?<p>It was mainstream. 2500 years ago. We don&#x27;t calculate the speed of a space rocket using horse power, and we shouldn&#x27;t encourage anyone introducing greek symbols into a programming language that is intented to me more than esoteric.<p>I&#x27;m often baffled why this is not more appearant to everyone. Haskell and haskell derived languages are failing to become mainstream, because:<p>- they were not designed with that goal in mind (actual statements of the language designers)<p>- the syntax is only friendly to those humans that wasted their life, studying the variant of math syntax, that stopped having an economic value the moment computers were invented. The syntax isn&#x27;t optimized to limit the cognitive load of actual real world use-cases. Instead, it&#x27;s optimized to make a fibonacci function look as much like ancient math as possible. Has anyone ever beed paid to code that function? No. Is this function particularly difficult to implement in other languages? No.<p>- They pretend computers don&#x27;t exist. Haskell implementations have operational semantics: they are just under-specified, unpredictable and implementation-specific.  Pretending computers don&#x27;t exist, doesn&#x27;t solve any problem in computer science. Performance and scalablility don&#x27;t need to be good; they need to be predictable by a human. The algorithmic complexitiy of any operation, should not became a secret hidden behind a curtain of mystery.<p>- The core problem we have with large code-bases is coordination of state. This requires standardisation and normalisation.. By making all state explicit arguments, and being all religious about it, you end with a zillion competing ways to structure and reflect on the state. Knee-deep in monad transformers that convert one type of state to some other type of state, one has to wonder: is it so bad that most programming languages just wrap every computation is one standarized state-monad? No! That&#x27;s actually a good thing.<p>- The cult surrounding it keeps propagating misconceptions about the nature of computation itself. Take your comment for example:<p>>Ultimately, functional programming lets you talk about what where imperative languages force you to talk about how.<p>This not true. Functional programming does not let you talk about the what. Haskell definately doesn&#x27;t let you just talk about the what. If i put &quot;e = m * c&quot; into haskell, i won&#x27;t suddenly get m, given an e. Just because the operational semantics of Haskell are under-specified and incomprehensible by anyone without an academic background and years of experience wasting time with Haskell, doesn&#x27;t mean there is no operational semantics. At it&#x27;s core, it&#x27;s just a term rewriter with a lot of fine print, that nobody bothered to properly document, and which is far from intuitive.<p>>even concepts like mutable variables and loops are not particularity intuitive.<p>Correct. But combined with term rewriting, dataflow and logic programming, and a bunch of other paradigms the best tools we&#x27;ve got to deal with a wide scenario of use-cases.<p>Functional programming is doing fine. Static type analysis is a great tool and we all use it often, but not exclusively, because it is the enemy of exploration. (A run-time type error, is one that carries real example data!)<p>It&#x27;s just that a lazy evaluated language drenched in a syntax that had its peak a millenium ago, pushed by fanatic supporters combined with completely unrealistic notions of computation and real-world use-cases, isn&#x27;t contributing.<p>And this Haskell derivate, is even worse. It has an actual lambda symbol. Everything about it screams to the uninitiated: i don&#x27;t want to be understand. I am exclusive.<p>The notion we need more ancient math syntax in a modern programming language, is similar to the notion we need more Shakesperian acting in Breaking Bad. People have been using math to produce economic value. They are just using languages that are optimized for their cultural background (using the dictionary and alphabet of our times), their cognitive skills, modern technology (auto-complete, refactoring) and their actual use-cases. These languages are commonly referred to as &quot;mainstream programming languages&quot;.",1388106460

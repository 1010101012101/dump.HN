People still want style, but the style market is already owned by Apple. Apple doesn't own everyone, because not everyone can afford or buy into it. For the past two years, various companies have captured a big part of rest of the market, but data plans, etc. are still prohibitively expensive, so not everyone has either an Android or iOS device. But, here comes Amazon. It has an extremely large part of the market already, and now they are going to pick up all of the people that couldn't drop $500 for an iPad. AND they say if you get Prime, you have unlimited streaming movies. It is a no-brainer.",1317412776

3058368,comment,3056414,3056414,1,0,pstoneman,,,"I can't post on serverfault, since the question's been locked, so I'll put useful things to consider here:<p>* 100% SLA doesn't always mean 'It has to be up all the time'. Depending on the customer or the supplier, it can mean 'We'll aim to have it up all the time, but if it's not, we'll pay you compensation according to a predefined scale'. Clearly, in this case, you need to define quite firmly what 'up' and 'down' mean, how you measure them, how you time them, and how you decide what compensation to pay.<p>* DNS failover or load balancing is often nearly good enough. It won't get you instantaneous failover, since you'll need to have a finite (albeit small) TTL, and some client stub resolver libraries cache stuff anyway in violation of the TTL. But it's an easy step on the way<p>* If you want true 100% uptime, ultimately, you need a single IP (or range of IPs) which will be permanently reachable. That pretty much means the IPs need to come from one AS number - in other words, one ISP or one company.<p>* You can choose an ISP or company which has multiple internet connections, peers with a lot of people in multiple locations, and has a well-designed network such that you feel confident they won't go offline. Amazon may be a good example, but they've had several recent high profile failures!<p>* You could do it yourself - in which case, you'd need to become an ISP, get your own AS number, and set up peering arrangements with multiple suppliers in multiple locations. This can be very costly, and you still have to run a network and servers yourself in a reliable way<p>* You might be able to find a supplier who peers in multiple locations, and anycasts their protected IPs within their AS. That way, the same IP comes from multiple locations and should be reliable. Akamai might do something similar to this, I think.<p>* Ultimately, however you do it, you'll have a very difficult time making it impossible for it to fail. You're into the game of making it exponentially less and less likely that it'll fail, but you can't eliminate all risk. At the end of the day, your contract with your customer needs to define what happens if you should fail to reach 100% uptime. Is it breach of contract? Or do you need to pay a penalty fee? In either case, however you host it, you ideally need to make sure your suppliers compensation to you if they have a failure will cover the losses you incur.",1317412601

Ok, I'm sure there are a few he'd be happy with, but his comments do sound all-encompassing.<p>And then he somehow tries to make it ""better"" by ripping on himself, too, saying he's a part of the problem.  Um, no, being self-deprecating in the same way that you're insulting everyone else does not magically make it ok for you to insult everyone else.<p>I've been using Linux (and a couple UNIXes on and off) for a little over 10 years.  So I can get around a UNIX-like system pretty well.  A lot of things are easy, and a lot of things aren't.  Saying that it's somehow someone's fault is ridiculous.  Claiming that all software developers are collectively lazy or don't care about user experience just doesn't hold up.<p>The funny thing is that he works in a position that <i>naturally</i> involves some difficult stuff.  Let's say my favorite language to write software in is called XYZ.  Say it's super easy, intuitive, concise, performant, and the method for compiling/deploying/distributing the end result of your hard work is trivial.  In all ways, this system is just beautiful to work with.<p>Great, but I'll bet you the guy who wrote all the development tools and runtime for XYZ had to do a lot of difficult work to make that possible.  Dahl is building a runtime for web applications.  Unless he's writing it in some high-level language, it's not going to be easy.  Supporting every platform he wants to support isn't going to be easy.  User interfaces should be as simple as they can be, but often that requires a lot of complexity under the hood.<p>Go down even farther.  Let's think about our basic building blocks.  Transistors.  Hgih and low, ones and zeroes.  It's a very simple interface.  You construct logical operations by using NAND, NOR, NOT, etc. gates, which are built from transistors.  Also simple.  But the next step for our modern computer is... well... the microprocessor.  And while it's made up of these incredibly simple building blocks, the combination of them is extraordinarily complex.  So the interface into that mess is also not the most friendly thing to work with: a machine instruction set.  So we build things on top of that to make it successively easier: assembly language, C, Ruby.<p>And the tools that come along with this are only as good as the technologies they're built on.  Tradeoffs must be made to be portable.  Yes, all this is a huge mess that ""we"" have collectively invented over the past 30-50 years or so, but it's simply not possible to go back to the 1970s, know exactly where we're going to be in the 2010s, and design the perfect system, even with foreknowledge.  The current state of computing is a product of the evolution of our technology.  Often that means doing the best you can today, and hoping for something better tomorrow.",1317411757

If Amazon can make people think of the Kindle Fire not as a piece of technology that is quickly out of date, but a bit of a premium device (albeit at a cut-rate price) that isn't going to feel old in a year, the economics will get much better over the product's life-cycle.  Given that the specs on the device are pretty good (dual-core processor, display with IPS) yet nebulous (I haven't seen a stated resolution, processor clock speed, or RAM amount), it's possible that Amazon wants people to think of this as a product that won't change as quickly as, say, Android devices change.  Amazon also has the option to exert a decent amount of control over the platform since they're doing both the hardware and the software and I think the Silk browser is part of that desire to move things that would be spec dependent off the device itself to ensure greater hardware longevity.<p>If Amazon is still selling this model 1-2 years from now, they'll be in a decent position.  If people obsess over specs rather than wanting to buy into an ""Amazon experience"" or similar, less-spec-driven purchase process, then Amazon might not be in as good a place given the low to negative margins at release.",1317411751

If with ""bug"" you are referring to syntax errors (being scheme, missing or wrong parenthesis), yeah, without a compiler/syntax checker it will be a bit hard to spot them sometimes. For algorithm testing, it's not different than what you'll do using a compiler, only slower (considering that testing usually involves testing various input combinations). Will, in this case, be a better course with the use of a compiler? Hard to tell, my impression is just that using only paper will make you focus more on the code you are writing, but this could not work for everyone.",1317411683

The Kindle Fire is the other way around; media consumption is forefront, everything else, including apps to an extent, are an afterthought.

Because current attitudes are that if you aren't developing everything purely object oriented with a design pattern or five using nosql for your data store you're a fucking imbecile. I shit you not I've seen a coworker spend half a day adding 800+ lines of get() and set() methods to a 150 line email script. The truly bizarre part is, it's not like he's stupid, or fresh out of school. The guy's a certifiable genius with six or seven years of industry experience under his belt.<p>This kind of cargo cult bullshit is, in my opinion, the single largest recurring (recursive?) problem in our industry. Unfortunately this isn't a new problem. Every generation of programmers finds some set of development concepts to enshrine as the gospel.",1317409239

We will definitely exceed the 50 goal before October 15th gets here.<p>The Reno hacker community is starting to bubble a little bit. We have a lot of people in the area that do remote work and work from home so you might be out at a bar and be sitting next to a great developer without realizing it because they are probably not used to discussing their work with people locally.<p>Some background, I run the Reno Collective coworking space in town. I've been working to pull these folks out of their remote work caves and start meeting one another either here at the space or at our events.<p>The business and ""technology"" community that gets most of the attention in Reno is pretty much stuck in 1995 and we've been trying to change that through Ignite Reno, WordCamp, monthly hacknights and now with Hack4Reno we're trying to be more public about the fact that there is a lot of great talent in the area.<p>I could go on forever, but if you're looking to get in touch with the local dev community, we are having the next Hack4Reno meetup on Wednesday at Reno Collective at 5:30pm or feel free to come by anytime during the week, I'd love to meet you.",1317409219

9132795,comment,9130083,9132270,0,0,danbruc,,,"First, I really don&#x27;t want to discourage you. I have myself reinvented a lot of stuff from a raytracer over a database to a kernel and a lot more. A simple steganographic tool, too. I think this is a great way to learn things, because it really makes you realize the complexity involved, how much effort other people have put into figuring things out and why some things look so quirky and make you think you can do it way better. But don&#x27;t be fooled, chances are pretty close to zero that you will come up with an idea that has not been tried and dismissed long ago. There are a lot of people out there much smarter than you and me. So reinventing stuff is good for learning, but improving on the state of art and coming up with something useful for others is really pretty unlikely.<p>Now having no clue may sound a bit insulting but it was really not meant as a personal attack. But just by searching for »detecting steganography in images« you will easily find a lot of papers and even software dealing with this and they also deal with your idea of a randomized embedding in the least significant bit. You obviously did not research what other people have tried and what works and what not and that is why I called it clueless. The abstract of »Reliable Detection of LSB Steganography in Color and Grayscale Images« [1] from 2001 and one of the top search results for me starts with the following abstract.<p><i>We describe a reliable and accurate method for detecting least significant bit (LSB) nonsequential embedding in digital images. The secret message length is derived by inspecting the lossless capacity in the LSB and shifted LSB plane. An upper bound of 0.005 bits/pixel was experimentally determined for safe LSB embedding. </i><p>So this idea has been rendered obsolete at least a decade and a half ago unless you only want to embed tiny messages in huge images. Hiding only a single tweet requires a uncompressed image of 0.64 MiB to remain safe. And I did not search for it, but there may be other algorithms making the situation even worse. And using lossless compression is a nonstarter to begin with because you will stick out of the sea of JPEG images. But there are of course ways to embed hidden information in JPEG images, but again there are also ways to detect this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Research/acm_2001_03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Research/acm_2001_03.p...</a>",1425315108

9132704,comment,9131592,9132211,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"WP is a perfectly fine tool for many scenarios. There&#x27;s something nice about having a blogging platform that&#x27;s easy to install and use. The problem I see if that this blogging platform gets shoe-horned into a CMS-like role with half-assed extensions and modifications, many of which are written by amateurs running a freemium-style model and often have little to no community source code review.  I find popular extensions are okay, its just when you start looking at more obscure stuff because now your WP needs to be Drupal-light and SugarCRM-like that you run into trouble.  WP is pretty much a victim of its own success.  Lots of people have made sure the Wrong Way to do things is easy in the WP ecosystem and that hurts the core product.<p>I&#x27;m really surprised to see a site that gets as much traffic as Wired using WP. I could see Drupal taking this role. Drupal, of course, is not without its faults. I&#x27;ve been part of a few Drupal roll-outs and have done development on it, and my god, there&#x27;s an ugly learning curve here.  If money is an issue, you can get a decent WP dev a lot less a Drupal shop would charge you.  I imagine Wired, being a print magazine in the age of dying print, probably didn&#x27;t have a big budget.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d love to see something as solid as Drupal but with the ease of WP. Maybe this middle ground is impossible, but it would be nice to whip up a Drupal instance and have certain roles or templates ready to go, like WP does.  Instead, stock Drupal is pretty much nothing out of the box and the dollars/time involved to make it something usable and finished can be significant.<p>>an average of four cookies for every visit (which messes with some caching attempts)<p>That&#x27;s a trivial fix in Varnish. I run Varnish in front of WP for my own personal blog.<p>>, I can tell just from your headers that you&#x27;re running on Apache 2.4.6, on PHP 5.6.6, and using Varnish 4<p>If that&#x27;s the worst sin they&#x27;ve committed, then I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re doing pretty well.  Securing WP isn&#x27;t that tough.  I find most LAMP apps are security nightmares and WP is just the posterboy for this and because of its popularity gets all the attention. If you&#x27;re not running an IDS/IPS and locking down WP, securing permissions on your server, running SELinux, etc then you&#x27;re just asking for trouble.<p>I used to feel pretty confident about Drupal from a security POV until SA-2014-003.  Considering how bad that was, it scared me a bit and makes me wonder why no one can make a CMS without major security issues in this day and age. I need to do the same amount of locking down with Drupal as I do WP. From a server admin role, there&#x27;s not much difference between the two. I still need to do all that security stuff and admins who say, &quot;Oh Drupal is secure I dont need to do that stuff&quot; are the ones who are going to continue to get burned.",1425314431

Either way, it&#x27;s a shitty argument to make... homeless services should be provided regardless of whether or not it attracts people because it&#x27;s the right thing to do.

9132566,comment,9128367,9131111,0,0,drostie,,,"Yep! If you want to learn a lot more about this stuff, search for the buzzword &quot;codata.&quot; Basically, we can start to define type systems which &quot;wall off&quot; a section (which may or may not have all the things you want to compute in practice; we don&#x27;t know!) which follows simple recursive rules from a base case up. This section is called &quot;data&quot;, acting upon it programmatically is called &quot;recursion&quot;, and proofs about it are called &quot;induction&quot;. This part of the computer is <i>not</i> Turing-complete and therefore we <i>can</i> solve the halting problem. Everything else is &quot;codata&quot; acted upon with &quot;corecursion&quot; and reasoned about with &quot;coinduction&quot;.<p>One super-awesome thing about the &quot;data&quot; used in codata systems is that, once you&#x27;ve proven that something halts, there is no formal distinction between lazy and eager evaluation -- it simply becomes a choice that the compiler makes, perhaps guided by pragmas inserted by a smart programmer.<p>One not-so-awesome thing: consider the normal model of the natural numbers, `data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat` where every number is either 0 or the successor of another natural number. The obvious definition of <i>recursion</i> involves stripping off a `Succ` structure one level deeper. Anything which follows that pattern is proven to halt, so it&#x27;s a whitelisted computation that can be used in other data-computations.<p>But now, consider the usual algorithm for GCD:<p><pre><code>    gcd&#x27; m n | n == 0    = m\n             | m < n     = gcd&#x27; n m \n             | otherwise = gcd&#x27; n (mod m n)\n</code></pre>\nIs this corecursive or recursive? It&#x27;s clearly recursive. But does the computer know that? We have to clue it in. We need to tell the computer that actually, given our definition of recursion here -- &quot;it&#x27;s recursive if we only go from n to n - 1&quot; -- holds a larger theorem, &quot;it&#x27;s recursive if we only go from n to some number strictly less than n&quot;. Even then, we have to prove that `mod m n < n` and our system needs to be guided to understand that it&#x27;s <i>okay</i> if `m` increases as long as `n` is strictly decreasing (the arguments could have been flipped, after all).<p>So this is your &quot;additional axioms in the system.&quot; They come when your &quot;recursion&quot; method is not the most obvious way to traverse the data structure; in this case we&#x27;re using argument-swaps and jumping through the graph of N to traverse two data structures simultaneously and it creates a bunch of headaches.",1425313389

Is the product/service something approximating a commodity?<p>If the answer is yes, then certainly premium pricing is not sustainable.  In the case of cloud services it&#x27;s not quite a commodity, but ultimately if the [cloud] service meets the customers technical and service/support requirements the main differentiator is going to be price.<p>B. How high are the switching costs?<p>Once a customer has invested in a certain product or product ecosystem, how expensive is it for them to switch?  With Apple vs Android the costs are not necessarily high, but it takes a decent amount of work to transfer media and adjust to new ways of doing things.  For some customers that may not be worth it.<p>C. How big of a factor is branding?<p>See Apple, GoPro, Amazon, BMW, Mercedes, Coach, etc.  With a physical product the brand is often a such large component of the buyer&#x27;s decision that even if there is a cheaper similar product it[the cheaper item] doesn&#x27;t even get consideration.  A Hyundai Genesis has many of the same luxury features as a BMW 5 series but is much cheaper.  But, probably 90% of the time, the person considering a 5 series is never going to even set foot in the Hyundai dealership.<p>In the IT context, the choice might be between a well-known software vendor and a much-cheaper alternative.  But enterprise customers typically are going to go with the name-brand option, even if they don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles it provides.  Many shops don&#x27;t need something like Salesforce but they pay the premium just the same.<p>D. How price sensitive is the target customer?<p>Depending on the customer and the market, sometimes the customer doesn&#x27;t really care if there is a cheaper alternative.  They&#x27;re happy with what they&#x27;re doing and the price difference might be a rounding error to them so they just stick with what they&#x27;ve always been doing.<p>So yes, premium pricing can&#x27;t last for some scenarios but that&#x27;s hardly a rule.",1425313322

9132516,comment,9125912,9130785,0,0,vidarh,,,"That&#x27;s true. My favourite language is Ruby. Which is an exercise in how to frustrate a compiler writer  (in a sign of deep seated masochism, I&#x27;m working on a ahead-of-time compiler for Ruby), and much of it certainly is a result of providing nice features.<p>But many of the worst offenders in such languages also have little to do with &quot;nice features&quot; and more to do with not thinking about compilation. E.g. one of the big issues with compiling Ruby is that classes can generally be re-opened at any time.<p>It&#x27;s an awesome feature for a lot of things. But it also makes it incredibly hard to formally reason about Ruby code.<p>What does &quot;1+1&quot; mean? You can&#x27;t know without knowing whether or not someone has overridden Fixnum#+. And that can happen anywhere. So even if you know that 1+1 is 2 now, after the next method call, you don&#x27;t know any more unless you&#x27;ve determined exactly what the intervening method call was, and traced everything it might have called. Oh, and you need to take into account threading. Executing 1+1 in a tight loop, expecting it to mean the same on every iteration? Can&#x27;t safely do that, as someone might be randomly redefining methods in another thread. Even if you determine that that can&#x27;t happen now, if anyone ever calls eval() on data you can&#x27;t statically determine (or its cousins such as &quot;require&quot;), you&#x27;re back to square one.<p>Of course 99% of the time nobody has a sane reason to do that, and the 1% (or more like 0.001%) when it happens, it&#x27;s almost always because someone is proving a point, and nobody would care about breaking the proving-a-point cases. Outlawing overriding methods of the basic system classes, or even &quot;just&quot; specifying a subset of basic methods that the implementations should treat as immutable would make optimising Ruby code immensely much easier with very little practical impact. (Ruby has the woefully underused &quot;freeze&quot; but that applies only to objects; a method-level &quot;freeze&quot; or &quot;final&quot; carefully applied to a few dozen rarely-if-ever methods would make a lot of difference; it&#x27;d even be fine to supply a way of overriding it, as at least then you&#x27;d be signalling clearly that you&#x27;re about to do something that requires disabling certain optimisations).<p>Providing restricted versions of &quot;eval&quot; (so you can provide guarantees about what will still be the same after eval), and the same for &quot;require&quot; would also make a huge difference (e.g. if I had a way of loading new code and being sure that it only defined new classes rather than modifying existing classes, I would be able to aggressively inline a lot of things in situations where I could determine types statically; without it, I can still do inlining but needs to do a lot of work to verify when changes have occurred and potentially fall back on a much slower path, which seriously increase the complexity and reduces the benefit of inlining)<p>The strength of language designs coming from people who are experienced at writing compilers is that you rarely see those kind of situations, because the first thing a compiler writer would tend to want to do would be to declare a lot of corner cases like the above as &quot;undefined behaviour&quot; at a minimum, and proceed to implement optimisations that would utterly break it.<p>While Ruby is my favourite language, my favourite influence when it comes to writing compilers is Niklaus Wirth, who from his first language work on successors to ALGOL-60 has consistently been working to reduce the complexity of his languages with each iteration (he has usually removed more than he has added in each new language). One might very well believe Wirth is too much of a purist, but while his languages tended towards the minimal, his overall principle is worth considering: He only wanted to retain functionality in his languages with proven benefit and that he understood how to implement efficiently. A lot of languages could benefit from extensive pruning of functionality on that basis.<p>(Incidentally, for my Ruby compiler if/when I finally get to the stage when these things matters, I <i>do</i> intend to deviate from Ruby and declare a whole lot of things that people don&#x27;t generally ever do but that should technically work as &quot;undefined behaviour unless you specify the --generate-horribly-slow-but-compatible-code switch or something to that effect)",1425312981

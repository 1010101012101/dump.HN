6833569,comment,6829725,6829725,4,0,joostdevries,,,"Programming languages are very much a matter of de gustibus.\nSo I respect the writers experiences. \nBut I have a slightly different perspective.<p>Let me first say where I&#x27;m coming from. I like:\na static typing. \nb support for FP and OO\nc targeted for JVM.<p>Compile times\nIt is my experience that compile times are not that bad if you use the support by SBT for continuous compile-deploy-test. Have a look at Typesafe Activator to get a feel what they&#x27;re moving towards.<p>Libraries and community\nI do agree that some frameworks, like Spray f.i., tend to overdo the concise DSL aspect. This seems to be especially prevalent with Scala developers coming from the academic world of monads. Or with a strong tendency to show of how clever they are to the detriment of usability. Scalaz had a strong similar tendency.\nI have noticed that frameworks like SBT and Scalaz are de-emphasising unpronouncable ungoogleable unintuitive operators. \nSo far I have hope that the Scalaz community will veer away from this.\nTo a certain degree every language community develops a culture about good vs bad code. Twitters Effective Scala guidelines are a wonderful contribution.<p>Magic syntax\nI&#x27;ve been using the Play framework for webapplications. And in my experience that is largely a pragmatic tool where I can just get things done.\nMy main criticism would be that sometimes new features seem to be not very well tested. F.i. multi project support did not really work for quite a few versions. That shouldn&#x27;t take up much time. \nI hope they address that.<p>Type inference\nComing from Java I like Scalas type inference. Although the compiler feedback can sometimes still be challenging. There has been great work in compiler messages giving advice on how to fix mistakes. F.i. the well known mistake of forgetting the = between a function declaration and implementation.\nBut there are still hairy situations. If you&#x27;ve ever had the infinite recursion type error (being addressed in newer version of the language) you know what I mean. Or using the json parser combinators in the Play framework with classes with one attribute f.i.<p>Other issues he mentions:\n- build tools. This has significantly improved since Typesafe started. I&#x27;d say that before that Scala wasn&#x27;t suitable for non academic use. There are still improvements to be made like speed, usability of SBT, maturity of the Eclipse based Scala IDE...\n- repetition of case classes. I have no idea what is meant with that. I think that writing a model of your domain in scala is a truy joy compared to java. And pattern matching and standard marshalling/unmarshalling to json etc is great.\n- the language being inaccessible and experimental. This is not my experience at all. Like any language it takes learning. But if you&#x27;re looking for a language that supports both FP and OO I find it very coherent and well thought out. I&#x27;d say beautiful even. For me the coursera courses on FP with Scala and Reactive programming with Scala have been the critical power boosts in becoming proficient enough to make the transition from hobby interest language to professional everyday tool.\n- &#x27;if you want true strong type systems use Haskell&#x27;. To me the &#x27;impurity&#x27; of FP in Scala is it&#x27;s strong suit. On the one hand for getting stuff done and on the other for using the vast ecosystem of JVM libraries and frameworks. Also I think that the writer will encounter quite a few inscrutable operators and overwrought type systems (like his complaint about Spray) in the world of Haskell.<p>To finish up I&#x27;d like to state what I like about Scala:\n- FP in the real world of web applications and mutable state. Accessibility to colleagues who come from OO & Java\n- Well thought out coherent language. Especially in combination with the Coursera courses I have just become a better programmer and system engineer.\n- Good interoperability with Java frameworks etc\n- good support for horizontal scaling, near realtime processing, non-blocking processing etc ie reactive programming.<p>Some things I have mixed feelings about:\n- reinventing the whole Java stack. It is true that f.i. non-blocking support has a pervasive &#x27;disruptive&#x27; influence. But for me there&#x27;s great value in mature well know libraries, server, frameworks that just work.\n- sometimes there are very common use cases that need quite a bit of research. F.i. it&#x27;s not easy to find out what the &#x27;canonical&#x27; way of processing xml is. \n- stability and documentation<p>MMDV \n(=My Mileage Did Vary)",1385992124

Even if you&#x27;re technically a doctor or a lawyer, you could get stuck being basically a robot. Whereas being someone who designs repeatable systems is much more rewarding.",1385991097

Considering the drone probably has a camera already for routine (non-piloted operations) weight wouldn&#x27;t be significant. Power wouldn&#x27;t be huge as wireless service wouldn&#x27;t be required until the drone is ready to land. Besides, this isn&#x27;t a long-flight drone.<p>>The range of the drones is already horrible.<p>The range of the drones is likely driven by business, not technology. I&#x27;m sure if Amazon is serious about this program they&#x27;ve selected a 10 mile radius from their processing centers as a way to control costs & give the drone high operating time margins. If they do it, and it works, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see larger runs in the future.<p>>The costs of controlling drones over the wireless networks would be pretty high too.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to that directly, but don&#x27;t forget Amazon already subsidizes wireless costs with Whispernet on the Kindle, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they&#x27;ve got some good agreements with wireless networks already.

6833461,comment,6832955,6832955,1,0,Communitivity,,,"I used to be a freelancer, and plan to be one again someday. The thing about freelancing is risk vs reward.  If you are good enough at selling, delivery, and juggling then the money you can make is astounding, especially if you can travel to wherever you need to go (client pays travel costs).  This potential reward comes with a pretty high risk. There will be weeks where you have no income, if you hit a bad spot in the economy maybe even a month with no income.  Having periods without income is not just a possibility, but happens to just about everyone at some point.<p>This means you&#x27;ll need self discipline. Until you get enough squirreled to survive just on your bank account for 3mos you must squirrel away every cent you can.<p>It also means that 3mos is just the bare bones parachute. You need to save money for medical emergencies, car emergencies, relative visits, conferences, etc.<p>You also might be thinking, well I made $100k at my last job, I can make that freelancing.  Problem is you are now covering your own medical insurance, and a host of other things that were cheaper or paid by the company when you collected a paycheck.  As an average figure you will need 1.6 times your salary to have the equivalent standard of living. So you&#x27;d need $160k. As an aside, your company probably bills you out at a 2x - 3x multiple, so this is not as much of a cost to corporations as it sounds.  Of course, when you start you may be working for smaller companies who can&#x27;t hire the big firms like where you used to work, so it might be big to them.<p>You&#x27;ll also work much harder as a freelancer if you are going to succeed.  You&#x27;ll need to spend between 40-60 hours a week on client work to keep clients happy (more like 30-40 once you get fully established, get a rhythm, and get regular repeat clients), then an additional 20-30 hours marketing yourself.  The good news is that you&#x27;re your own boss. Except...you&#x27;re not. The clients now become your bosses, until you are established enough that you are turning down work, or better yet farming it out to trusted freelancer friends for a 7% cut of the work.<p>Marketing yourself is key.  You asked how you can tell you are ready. If you&#x27;re reputation is not such that you are getting at least one unsolicited query a week asking to talk to you about a job opportunity, then you&#x27;re going to have to work hard on marketing, very hard. I&#x27;d recommend you find a corporate job in that case, and work on building your reputation: speak at conferences for free, contribute to open source projects, blog, participate on the professional social sites (quora, LinkedIn, stack overflow,reddit for starters).  I get several unsolicited queries a week, and I don&#x27;t feel my reputation is where I want it to be yet to go back into freelancing.<p>On risk there is always the legal risk, and you can protect yourself better...incorporate before any consulting as an S or C, and get liability insurance. Std caveat: I am not a lawyer, and no part of this post is legal advice in any way, merely an expression of personal opinion.\nHave I scared you yet? If so, good.  Freelancing is a roller-coaster ride full of risk, where you work harder for mostly the same std of living. If you are good, and lucky, you can make much more money than you ever would at a salary and grow your consulting into a lifestyle business. Just remember that for every 100 there convinced they are the lucky ones, one of them will make it.  Don&#x27;t become a freelancer as a way to get rich, the optimal approach for that is to be a hard working corporate person at a company, ideally a B-Series startup.  Want more risk and potential reward? Then join a startup.  For me being a freelancer is about freedom. I get to do the work I want to do (as long as money is not tight), have freedom on when to do it (as long as client deadlines are met), and do it the way I want to do it.<p>Some of you may have noticed...I said I was a freelancer, and plan to be one again. I got married, had a child, had several illnesses in the older generation of my family, and needed something with less risk.  I&#x27;m now getting back to the point of freelancing/a software company and when I do, I will let you know how it goes.",1385990960

Here&#x27;s my argument: For any single living person &quot;hogging&quot; the universe, there are an infite number of possible persons waiting to get a shot at life. After a while of living, most people experience diminishing returns and get jaded. New people do not have that problem. So if you&#x27;re really about <i>life</i>, and not just for your own tiny little sliver and interpretation of it, the choice is clear.

Property is one thing, we can debate that forever (as far as I&#x27;m concerned, neither capitalism nor communism nor any of their variants can yet claim victory, if ever), but knowledge? We now have to stop our children from <i>knowing</i> stuff in order to create a more egalitarian society? That&#x27;s too insane even for my European &quot;socialist&quot; standards.<p>Second, learning all kind of basics, from math to biology to chemistry are all accepted parts of the curriculum. In this age computer sciences should be a normal part of that. We don&#x27;t teach kids to write so that they will become literary geniuses, we don&#x27;t teach them biology so they&#x27;ll cure cancer. We teach them a basic understanding upon which they can either build, or at the very least use it to have better grasp on the world around them. Just like mixing some chemicals in the lab, or writing a simple essay, basic coding is an exercise to help them learn. There is neither the intention nor the expectation that they will become programmers when they grow up.",1385989547

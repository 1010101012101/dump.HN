At first I thought the office assistant was going to sites that she shouldn't have, until I got hit by it while on Autoblog.com which is an AOL site. At that point noscript and adblock got installed. But there are definitely badthings coming from ad networks. They are subtle - it may only try to send the payload every 10 or 20 screen refreshes - but they do send it. It took 10 screen refreshes on Autoblog, for example. This was some months ago, so I don't know if there is still a problem. The payload for me was the real looking Windows box that pops up and tells you that you have 20 viruses and to fix it just send $29.95 to this site and it will all go away.",1292032786

The project is simple javascript, css and html. The idea is to create textual effects as opposed to graphics effects so that words can be morphed into other words, words can disappear, change form and ... you get the idea I hope. The idea is to allow poets the opportunity to play simply and easily with the typographical nature of their poetry as opposed to the traditional syntax, rhythm, rhyme and other techniques of verse.<p>If this sounds like something you would be interested in please join me in working on this. If you have ideas or suggestions please email me. A sample electronic poem (in Italian!) is here: http://durity.com/double_figure/codex_enter.html so you can see for yourself the beginnings of what I am after.<p>This is my first free & open source software project, I am incredibly excited :)<p>-- igravious",1292032698

1993902,story,,,15,33,idontlikebacon,"Ask HN: Paying for University as an undocumented student",,"Hey HN,<p>I've been living in the United States since the age of 2, but I was actually born Saudi Arabia. During my sophomore year in high school my parents clued me in on the fact that they never actually got me my citizenship, and that I only had an overstayed tourist visa.<p>But things became really problematic when I graduated and realized that my illegal status makes me ineligible for all of the scholarships I earned (one in particular is a full ride Floridian scholarship) and would force me to pay out of state tuition.<p>So with no way to pay for school, I took a gap year which I'm four months into. I've been supplementing this off time with OCW computer science lecture videos and a ton of self study; however, everything's much more arduous and lonely than studying in a college environment and I don't want to fall behind.<p>I've come up with two solutions: apply to universities in Canada and Europe and hopefully be admitted to one of those countries on a student visa or stick it out here and find a way to pay for school. So I'm coming to you, HN, for some advice on how I could possibly pay for school. Are there private, merit based scholarships I could earn? Could I work a job with only a ITIN and no SSN? Is there a way I can petition for in-state tuition?<p>Please, any advice would help me out.<p><i>edit:</i> I realize, on paper, I'm a criminal. I really don't see it that way, and I'd like to try everything I can to stay in the United States. I also cannot apply for citizenship with an overstayed visa and leaving the country would prevent my reentry for 10 years; something I'm trying to avoid.<p><i>edit 2:</i> I'm here to talk about how to pay out of state tuition, not my status. For those who are curious, here are the only options I have when it comes to dealing with my status: get married, leave the country and be barred from reentry for 10 years, or wait for reform. So my stopping being a ""criminal"" is not a matter of choice or lack of will.",1292032331

1993889,comment,1993129,1993679,0,0,wrs,,,"Aren't interfaces essentially a reification of duck typing? If it implements the duck interface, it's a duck. So the reason you'd want it is just to have a conventional way to define what a duck is, and ask if an object was one. (And you could probably implement this in about three lines of Ruby.)<p>Now, many languages with formal interfaces (e.g., Java) are strongly typed, and they treat interfaces as types. Thus, for example, classes have to declare up front what interfaces they implement. That doesn't fit well with the flexible attitude of a duck-typed language. However, if interfaces were just collections of method signatures that could be tested against objects at runtime, that would be perfectly compatible with duck typing.<p>Languages like Modula-3 that use structural type equivalence sort of do this even in a strongly-typed system.

7345168,comment,7338331,7339178,1,0,beagle3,,,"> it is (or at least used to be) a core component of Windows, and very tightly coupled with parts of the operating system that have nothing to do with web browsing. (Navigating local files, for one thing.) Consequently, overhauling IE without overhauling Windows is (or at least was) a hairy proposition and Microsoft decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.<p>That&#x27;s the company line, they even stated this in court. It might be true today, but I seriously doubt it -- it was definitely NOT true at the time they stated this in court. It was put into the OS with duct tape, definitely not anything at any &quot;core&quot;.<p>I saw a demo of 98 or ME or XP (don&#x27;t remember which one - the first one that came with integrated IE4) with the web control disabled; some &quot;web folder&quot; views and &quot;active desktop&quot; did not work but the older win95/2000 &quot;folder view&quot; did. If you did not use ActiveX, you didn&#x27;t feel anything amiss.<p>In the default setup, if you browsed a local directory through &quot;iexplore.exe&quot;, it would fork &quot;explorer.exe&quot; opening another window unexpectedly, although &quot;explorer.exe&quot; would not fork one for a web view (but folder view->web view->folder view did again). Definitely felt like the work of someone who had no access to the &quot;core&quot; to integrate it properly.<p>If you believe that NOT supporting a newer Trident engine and IE shell on older OS is anything but a political decision, I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn you might be interested in. Sure, it costs more to support - but it&#x27;s a rounding error in Microsoft&#x27;s development budget.<p>Finally, even if the &quot;core&quot; issue is true, which (as I stated) I have issues with, the architecture lets them easily keep the old &quot;web component&quot; in the core, and only use the newer one from the IE container. The decision is political in every possible way.",1393991688

Mixing above and below grade conductor on the same distribution line is not a common construction practice, at least not downstream of the first customer. There are a few reasons.<p>Most faults seen on overhead distribution systems are momentary (i.e. they clear without human invention, e.g. line-to-line squirrel contact). For this reason, automatic reclosers are typically used at the station breaker. Conversely, automatic reclose is not used on underground distribution systems because momentary contacts are rare and attempting to reclose on a permanent fault just causes further damage to your breaker and other distribution assets.<p>Additionally, the types of conductor used for underground and overhead applications are completely different. They&#x27;d have to be spliced going into and out of the duct (you don&#x27;t just put wires in the ground, you have to pour a concrete-encased duct) which adds an additional point of failure.<p>I understand that have two outages per year is annoying, but the thing about power distribution is that making a perfect system is much, much more expensive than making one that works most of the time for most of the people. And that money comes from your electricity rates.",1393991601

7345148,comment,7344466,7344883,2,0,gexla,,,"There is, more so than Linode for example. EC2 isn&#x27;t a hosting provider. The instances can just disappear and everything on that instance is gone.  If you are going to host a site there and do it right, then you need to fire up multiple instances and wire them together. There are tools to help with this. For persistent data storage, there is EBS. There are also tools available to running your application across multiple servers. These tools also create more complexity and failure points. For example, I believe EBS has been the cause of sites going dark in past AWS outages. Then you have AWS challenges such as crap IO on the smaller instances and more cost / complexity for getting around that. Dealing with all this gets expensive for the &quot;just starting out&quot; stage. It&#x27;s probably okay for the &quot;middle&quot; stage when you are getting a lot of growth and have the cash to spend.<p>If you are just starting out, it&#x27;s best to go with a more conventional provider.<p>I&#x27;m not a guru with AWS or systems admin in general, but these are the sorts of issues I have run into in the past.",1393991226

There&#x27;s, of course, nothing wrong with that. Lots of hacker types have that tendency. Feynman used his own notation for trigonometric functions in high school because he thought the existing one was stupid. It&#x27;s a handicap in many situations, but an advantage in many others. The world needs both kinds of people.<p>Anyway, point is, the traditional pathways to success are based on certain metrics, and people flowing through that pathway will optimize toward those metrics to the exclusion of others, inflating them (that&#x27;s Goodhart&#x27;s Law). You&#x27;re someone with an aversion to traditional pathways who&#x27;s trying to reach life goals through those pathways. The system wasn&#x27;t made for people like you. This automatically puts you at a disadvantage, as your time and effort is spread out between a lot of things, only some of which help up the metric the grad school people are looking for.<p>So take a look at yourself and gauge your skills: you&#x27;re obviously competent, you&#x27;re intrinsically motivated, you&#x27;re persistent, but you&#x27;re bad at (or your life conditions preclude you from) optimizing to certain metrics. Given this information, if you want to do better, you can either give yourself a handicap (take less credit hours or easier classes) or change the game to something you&#x27;re better at (look for less GPA-centric grad school programs, consider other future possibilities -- also see etrevino&#x27;s comment!).<p>In the further future, look for smaller places and higher risk/reward scenarios. Working in those kinds of environments will let you take on challenges on your own terms. Finally, many of the problems you mentioned at college would be nonexistent at a smaller school. At a smaller place, people are more willing to bend rules and to make exceptions given extenuating circumstances. Keep that in mind when making future decisions.<p>Oh, and, yeah, the system is incredibly broken.

Android&#x27;s rise isn&#x27;t really the result of arrogance on Apple&#x27;s part.

To the extent a lot of developers prefer Android to iOS, it&#x27;s an opportunistic preference -- not a moral or philosophical one. Developers will go where the users are. More and more users are on Android. A secondary factor is that Android is an easier testing and deployment environment.",1393988738

Well, I&#x27;d say that there is none.  I was merely trying to convey that being fluent in both imperial and metric is better than being fluent in only metric.  As long as it doesn&#x27;t hurt me (which imperial doesn&#x27;t) the more skill-sets I have, the better!<p>I hope you better see where I&#x27;m coming from now.

It may still be a bold claim, I don&#x27;t know, but there&#x27;s certainly more thought put in here than in many other icon sets I&#x27;ve seen.<p>If you see what they&#x27;ve done with the icons, they&#x27;ve thought through a variety of use cases and the various facets of those use cases. There are SVG icons that can have both styling and behavior applied to them via data- attributes, but there is also an icon font. You can mix and match these at will where it makes sense. You can leverage the technology that makes sense in places where it makes sense, perhaps using a slower but more flexible version (SVG with data- attributes using their JS library) of the icon in a place where you need the flexibility, while using a faster-to-download version (icon font without any JS) in places where speed is tantamount and the extra functionality can be omitted.<p>They&#x27;ve also designed for the fact that these icons will be useful both at small sizes and at large sizes, by providing different designs at smaller sizes that are more fine-tuned to that size. See, for example, <a href=""https://useiconic.com/icons/account/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://useiconic.com/icons/account/</a>, and click the icon to show the three different sizes at the same scale. You&#x27;ll notice the strokes are of different thicknesses, so that the smaller icon sizes look better. In the font, the three different sizes instead correspond to different weights of the font, so that you have that same flexibility there.<p>The icons themselves are also programmatic objects, so for example the account icon from above can be switched from log in to log out mode in the same SVG file by invoking a method or setting an attribute, if you want to do that. Or, you can use the icon font, in which case they are separate (and inert). The intent (if it isn&#x27;t already done) is to implement these as Web Components where supported, I believe.<p>The icon font&#x27;s stylesheet is provided in LESS, SASS, and Stylus formats so users of different people who use different systems can customize as they desire.<p>They also intend to open source their toolchain for producing the icons, supposedly both helpful Illustrator scripts and helpful Grunt tasks for auto-generating various types of files for the icons.<p>You can read more about their intent at the original Kickstarter here: <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/207474036/iconic-advanced-icons-for-the-modern-web"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/207474036/iconic-advanc...</a> .<p>I don&#x27;t work for them, I just contributed to the Kickstarter and have been following along. They&#x27;ve done a great job of doing just about everything they&#x27;ve promised, and in a pretty fantastic timeframe.",1393988620

The power of the state needs to be checked, for instance, and individual rights such as freedom of speech and freedom to organise must be guaranteed. The most successful new democracies have all worked in large part because they avoided the temptation of majoritarianism—the notion that winning an election entitles the majority to do whatever it pleases. India has survived as a democracy since 1947 (apart from a couple of years of emergency rule) and Brazil since the mid-1980s for much the same reason: both put limits on the power of the government and provided guarantees for individual rights.",1393988478

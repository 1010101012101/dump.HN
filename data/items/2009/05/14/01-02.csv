608053,comment,607937,607937,0,0,patio11,,,"I got an advertisement from these folks in my inbox this morning because I pay for Clicky.  (Totally worth it, by the way.)<p>Here's the fundamental problem with this advertising venture: everybody in the ecosystem freeloads on the site that makes the ""sale"".  (Convinces a user to pay $X for access to the content on that site ""and by the way get access to all these other sites, too!"")  This makes a lot of sense for, e.g., Paypal.<p>Quick aside on how Paypal works: everybody else in the ecosystem freeloads on eBay, because eBay is far and away the #1 source of Paypal accounts and every marginal Paypal account helps every other Paypal merchant.  However, a user signing up for a Paypal account in <i>your</i> checkout funnel sucks for conversion.  Ideally, you'd want to get new accounts generated by other businesses but never have to pay the ""new account"" tax yourself.  However, since Paypal makes a cut of all transactions and eBay makes a huge direct profit for every additional account they sign up, it makes sense for eBay to grossly subsidize the rest of the ecosystem.  (Plus, they can control it such that you can't play in their ecosystem without paying the new account tax.)<p>OK, now take this to content businesses: remember, everyone freeloads off the site that wins the account -- you don't have to convince an existing account to open their wallet again, you merely need to attract their eyeball.  But users don't perceive value from ""Get access to X... and, by the way, a bunch of other sites you might not care about and we won't list right now"".  They're willing to pay for X.  If you're X, where X is presumably something massive like the New York Times or deeply meaningful to users like, I don't know, HN would be, and you know people will pay you money for your content, <i>why the heck</i> would you offer to split that money with other people who are <i>not</i> sharing appreciable amounts of money with you?  (Because you're massively bigger and better monetized than them, you directly generate far more accounts in the system -- losing money, brand value, and user attention on each -- than you receive from, e.g., my site which has 50k visits a month.)<p>Ecosystems based on freeloading don't work unless the equilibrium is such that all players benefit from the freeloading.  In this system, the players which you need to enable the freeloading are greatly disadvantaged by it.  Sucks to be them.  Accordingly, they won't sign up, and without them there is no ecosystem to speak of.",1242264485

For a given number, it is impossible (or at least difficult) to tell the relative importance of each factor.<p>Edit: This got me thinking: couldn't 'karma'-based voting help prevent the erosion that affects many other sites? If those dedicated members have high rank, there is a switching cost to joining another site, because they lose that elevated weight. That keeps them ""in the game"", whereas many other similar sites have lost the original members as average quality declined, which began a feedback loop of poorer quality.<p>Then, if elevated weight gives those users greater influence, the original character of the site is preserved because (1) the original users don't leave and (2) those users exert great influence on the site.<p>The only weakness is preventing low quality posters gaining karma weight through the voting of other low quality posters, thereby undermining the quality of high-karma users.",1242263138

In general, <i>caching is really hard to do properly.</i> I think the problems with the back button stem from ambiguity in what back actually means. Does it revert a form transaction? Does it restore the cached value of the previous page? Does it go back to the previous URL, updating the content? Since the web uses a stateless protocol, it's unclear to what extent the cache is still valid.<p>(Also: Does anybody else find articles with large, semi-relevant images between nearly every paragraph to be incredibly irritating?)",1242263135

This is hypothesized to happen for many different reasons, including a decline in the competitiveness of other economic sectors (caused by appreciation of the real exchange rate as resource revenues enter an economy, a phenomenon known as Dutch disease), volatility of revenues from the natural resource sector due to exposure to global commodity market swings, government mismanagement of resources, or weak, ineffectual, unstable or corrupt institutions (possibly due to the easily diverted actual or anticipated revenue stream from extractive activities).

The thing that makes the FAA such a model of effectiveness compared to other regulatory bodies is that it&#x27;s interests are aligned with the industry as a whole.  When a plane (or driverless car) crashes everybody in the industry suffers a loss of business.  Everybody would like to slack off a bit on safety themselves while their competitors are held to the highest standards, of course, but they&#x27;d mostly all rather have high standards as a general rule so the regulatory capture that occurs makes the FAA more focused on safety.  All because consumers have alternatives to flying and are intrinsically more scared of flying than of other means of transportation.<p>And it will be the same with automated cars.  People are intrinsically predisposed to not trust automated cars and people will still be perfectly capable of driving cars themselves.

In Georgia, the HOPE scholarship paid for 100% of my tuition and fees, and the Pell grant paid for a decent portion of my living costs.<p>That said, education is one of the most valuable things in the world.  If you're thinking of it as a risk/reward based on how much you pay versus how much you could earn, you're doing it wrong.",1209520422

177205,comment,177116,177191,0,0,LPTS,,,"Don't worry I got us covered.  I agree with this guy and have chosen such a problem.<p>I'm targeting the problem of medication adherence.  It's a 100 billion dollar problem.  There are 435,000 people in the USA with HIV.  Medication adherence at between 70-90% is the biggest cause of disease progression in people with HIV, because at this level, the disease is most likely to mutate.  There are 1.5 million new diabetics each year.  Diabetics who adhere have 33% less hospitalizations.  Hypertension and high cholesterol are two others that have great benefits from more adherence.<p>Adherence is such a huge problem that a solution would have the same health effect as a blockbuster drug across disease types.  The best part is, you don't have to resort to advertising.  At 20$ a month (very cheap compared to the costs of non-adherence) we make 1 million dollars a year off every 4167 customers while solving a huge problem in an industry that has been unable to solve it itself.  A couple studies that show our protocol is effective, improves outcomes, and is cost effective, and every insurance company and government healthcare agency becomes a potential client.  With such a base of customers using our product, we can then innovate the hell out of the patient facing medical market.<p>This problem falls through the cracks.  I think we can solve it, get great financial results, and lay the groundwork to solve other big problems in healthcare, and we are developing that.",1209520375

177196,comment,176789,177126,0,0,wanorris,,,"Your view of how this works wouldn't be all bad.<p>However, the original article was talking about standardized testing modeled after the test used in primary and secondary schools. This includes the government setting minimal, uniform standards, and has often led to cutting ""advanced"" or ""peripheral"" material to concentrate on teaching ""fundamentals"" (i.e. the stuff that bores the smart kids to tears). Schools that don't pull resources from other areas to concentrate on teaching to the test may see their funding cut, because their students don't do well enough on the tests.<p>When you talk about the positives of having standard tests, be careful what you wish for, because what shows up may not be what you had in mind.",1209519616
177195,comment,176866,176866,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My understanding is that McKinsey & Co. operate on this model and Google (among others) hire like mad from among the ranks of McKinsey almuni.  Interestingly Google seems to be leaning towards the ""up or out"" model, as well, among their business folks (but are the opposite with their engineers, and do everything they can to retain people).<p>I'd be curious to know about any development shops that go this route.  It makes sense to me, but I'm an outlier (I've never held a full-time job--I worked part-time while I was in college, then started my own business, and did some long-term contract work, now I'm on to another business).  I don't see much sense in working on the same project for life.  Then again, I've been involved in Webmin for 8 years, and there are plenty of areas I still find interesting...so maybe it's just the ability to flit around between various areas of the project that matters to staying ""self actuating"" as the article puts it.",1209519500

It ships with full fledged OpenGL (even going so far as to give non-shader-enabled cards shader support), and even help pioneer some really nice GL extensions that make game dev easier.  You can use virtually any programming language you would ever want to build games with (sorry, no DarkBASIC...).<p>My MacBook can play World of Warcraft and Half Life 2, and that is more than I could ever hope to build as an indie developer.

Much of forecasting has less to do with the actual material explanations of events and more with observed historical conditions and probability.<p>A 50% chance of rain means ""in all of recorded history, when conditions were similar, it rained 50% of the time,"" which leaves a lot to be interpreted by meteorology advancements. It does not mean that the ""rain trigger"" has a 50% chance of being pulled, since as we know, past results do not affect future outcomes in a pure probability, and the past conditions can only be correlated to rain, not directly tied to causation.<p>Also, I think there's a sweet spot somewhere in between a couple of hours and hundreds of years.

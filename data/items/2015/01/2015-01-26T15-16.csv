Go&#x27;s gdb support was never great, and the team appears to have decided it&#x27;s a fool&#x27;s errand. On the other hand, the Delve project looks like it&#x27;s serious about building a &quot;real&quot; debugger for Go (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8595407"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8595407</a>). Supposedly it works on Linux, but I&#x27;m waiting on Mac support, which I understand is held up on Linux/Mach/Darwin differences.<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at printf() debugging (I worked on embedded systems in a past life, so it&#x27;s a skill I&#x27;ve had to develop). I&#x27;m also considering adding some more structured log/trace/metrics stuff (perhaps exposed via a simple web UI) that would allow me to escape the &quot;tyranny of the ever-scrolling console&quot;.<p>But in the end, I&#x27;ll consider Go dead for game development (at least for me) if the debugger situation doesn&#x27;t get fixed. I&#x27;m just betting that it will.",1422287984

8947633,comment,8947080,8947514,0,0,Sander_Marechal,,,"Sure. The problem is that swords don&#x27;t have much effect on an armoured opponent. There are three types of attacks you can do with a sword: slashing, stabbing and cutting. Against a gambeson (jacked made of 20+ layes of linen stitched together) stabbing works, slashing is hard and cutting mostly doesn&#x27;t work. Now add a layer of maille over the gambeson. Cutting doesn&#x27;t work at all anymore, slashing probably only bruises you or breaks some bones and stabbing only works with narrow and sharp-tipped swords. Replace the maille with steel plates and you&#x27;re pretty much invulnerable to swords, except at the joints, eyeslits, etc).<p>So, sending out a group armed with swords on the battlefield isn&#x27;t going to do much. You want warhammers with backspikes that can pierce steel plate and crush bone, halberds that can hit so hard it crushes anything underneath armour, long pikes to keep the enemy at a distance, bows to pierce maille. The best weapon on the battlefield is actually mass. Get a group large enough close together and trample your opponents.<p>That&#x27;s how most battles were won. In viking and early medieval times you would use large shields and short spears, create a shield wall and run over your opponent. Later on heavy cavalry appeared who could easily run over them. Cavalry dominated until the English started using the longbow en masse to kill the mounts of the cavalry. Swiss pikemen started using 6+ meter long pikes in tight bock formations. These pikes were so long that cavalry could be stopped dead before they reached the pikemen in a charge. It&#x27;s like a wooden cumple zone. That pretty much spelled the end of heavy cavalry. Then soldiers started using halberds to get in between the pikes and crush pike blocks.<p>Swords were often carried on the battlefield but usually as a backup weapon, not as the primary weapon. Their cross shape granted them a lot of symbolic meaning in those religious times, but there are much better weapons available if you want to win large battles.",1422287809
8947632,comment,8947080,8947514,0,0,bane,,,"just echoing what termain said. Going back to at least the Greek Phalanx and up to even quite a while after the introduction of gunpowder, massed warfare typically involved long weapons like spears or pikes.<p>A reasonably good depiction is the Phalanx shown in the movie &quot;300&quot;. The history of warfare is generally about increasing the standoff distance between two militaries. The side with longer spears generally did better, then the side with the better archers.<p>Even after gunpowder was introduced, the reload time was so long that after getting a shot off, armies would switch to pikes.<p>The &quot;wall of men in formation&quot; you see in the Napoleonic wars and the American Revolutionary and Civil wars was sort of the last use of that kind of traditional formation and movement.

Have a look at the Wikipedia article for more details: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_program</a><p>Most of the imagery you&#x27;re looking at is probably from Landsat 7, which launched in 1999 and is still (partially) functional and active today.  (Edit: scratch that, it looks to be all very recent Landsat 8 data.)<p>Due to the need to have comparable datasets over multiple generations of satellites, newer platforms (e.g. the recently launched Landsat Data Continuity Mission, a.k.a. Landsat 8) deliberately target similar spatial resolutions as the older platforms (This is a good thing!).<p>Next, Landsat as a program is focused on uses like landcover classification, monitoring broad changes over time, etc.  There&#x27;s a higher-resolution 15m pan-chromatic band on the past few generations, but the real value is in the lower-resolution (30m, 60m, or 100m) multispectral bands. The visible bands are just the tip of the iceberg, and they actually aren&#x27;t the most useful for the &quot;main&quot; purposes of landsat (land cover classification, etc).<p>For many uses cases in remote sensing, we&#x27;re much more interested in having good spectral coverage and a long record of changes than in having very high spatial resolution.  Landcover classification has always been a key use case for the Landsat missions.  Most of the information is in the spectral signature of a given pixel.  (Some recent methods use texture, etc, but it&#x27;s less useful than you&#x27;d think.) There&#x27;s a trade-off between the wavelength being observed, the spatial resolution, and the exposure time.  Because all bands need to be acquired in a similar amount of time, longer wavelength bands (e.g. mid-far infrared) will always have a lower spatial resolution than panchromatic or visual bands.  (The transparency of the atmosphere is actually the main player here, but I&#x27;ll skip the details.)<p>The Landsat program has been invaluable in documenting and understanding human, ecologic, geologic, and hydrologic changes over the past >30 years.  We don&#x27;t have anything comparable!  It&#x27;s really, really incredible imagery.",1422287194

Sometimes I can be rude, and down-votes are not unexpected in those cases of course.<p>Some possible reasons for this are:<p>1. I&#x27;ve become more sensitive.
2. The quality of my comments have gone down.
3. More people are using the down-vote privilege to express simple disagreement.<p>Of course, this is not a complete list.<p>#1 is unlikely, I am doubtful that my personality has changed much over 3 years. #2 is possible, as I get more comfortable on HN I am more likely to post poorly thought out or emotional comments. My theory behind how #3 could be the reason is that the type of user that is gaining the down-vote privilege is changing.<p>Regardless if this is real or imagined I am certainly feeling this way and wondering if others feel this way. A key point is that this is not the way I felt about HN initially. I&#x27;ve been on HN for about 3 years, this negative sentiment has been growing for roughly the last year.<p>If the reason for the change is #3, what could be a solution? I really love the site and would hate to wind up not using it. One idea I had was for more visibility given to the down-votee. Up-voting affects the placement of a comment on the page (i think?) and ticks the little score counter but down-voting can completely remove a comment or at least make it harder to read. Down-voting is a more powerful action (vs up-voting) and it is an ability only given to a limited number of users. It might be time to try to implement some sort of repercussion for &quot;misusing&quot; this ability or to redefine what proper use of this ability is.

This is even easier to do in Go, since you can just send the messages over a channel and not have to worry about properly implementing a lock free algorithm, and spit them out in a `recover()` function surrounding your main (or look at them in GDB).<p>Do you know of a library that facilitates this?",1422286762

8947500,comment,8946807,8946807,0,0,putzdown,,,"Articles like this sadden me deeply. There are too many Java programmers who are misinformed about the merits of their language and the supposed weaknesses of other languages—especially C++. I&#x27;ve worked extensively with Java and C++ for nearly twenty years, so I know the ins and outs of each. I have never understood why people would say that the performance of Java has &quot;caught up&quot; with C++. It&#x27;s not even close. When you use Java, you don&#x27;t use it for speed. You want C++ for that. As for safety, C++ has made major strides in the last few years and is now, by virtue of features like std::shared_ptr<>, as safe as you want it to be. But that leads us to &quot;simplicity.&quot; There&#x27;s no question that Java wins here. C++ is an incredibly complicated language—a federation of languages, as Scott Meyers says. The benefit of C++ is that it can (as of C++11, anyway) marry both extreme speed and excellent safety—but to do so you either have to really know what you&#x27;re doing or abide by a strict subset of the language. Java holds you to a stricter subset to begin with. There&#x27;s a loss of power but a gain in simplicity.<p>Of course neither language is terribly safe as compared with a modern functional language, but that&#x27;s not on the post author&#x27;s radar.<p>Frankly, if I were choosing a set of languages to work with now I would not choose Java and C++. I&#x27;d choose C++ and Haskell, or some such highly pure language. Java provides a &quot;blue collar&quot; level of safety, but I find in general that the gains over modern C++ in this area are not worth the costs. If I really want a clearly safer language than C++ (or C), I want something a lot safer (and, preferably, faster) than Java.<p>But those whose careers are tied to Java will keep beating these drums.

It&#x27;s true that people like to create and be created, but as sad as it is, being &quot;human-made&quot; is hardly a quality you can run entire economics on. Say, I create a new work of art. How can I exchange it for food? I could sell it for a bunch of credits to someone who appreciates my work, and then use those credits to buy food made by machines. But machines don&#x27;t need that money, they just make food and run on machine-controlled power generation, etc. They&#x27;re not participating in the economy; paying for that food becomes just a weird kind of tax, at which point we&#x27;d be better off just giving the food away - eliminating the unneccessary theatre.<p>Being able to focus on creating beautiful and interesting things is the promise of automated future. I don&#x27;t think anyone in their right mind could think that there will be no economy of anything at all - as long as you have people exchanging things, there&#x27;s always one. It doesn&#x27;t really matter much what kind of economy it is (though you could get a good guess by observing content creation and sharing dynamics on the Internet when no one is trying to monetize it) - what matters is that it won&#x27;t be the same system you use for getting your basic needs (food, shelter) fulfilled.<p>- RE scarcity. I see two problems with it. One that in western societies there&#x27;s almost no visible scarcity at all. You look around and see shops overflowing with all sorts of dirt-cheap products. We&#x27;re isolated from the actual scarcity by many layers of abstraction, and it isn&#x27;t even reflected in the prices - otherwise gas or meat wouldn&#x27;t be so cheap as they are right now.<p>Humans do have a drive for achieving more (or more than others), but our economic system is built completely around the concept of growth - to the point that we use up resources in an exponentially increasing rate and have to invent artificial scarcities just to keep the whole machine from falling apart on the edges (see the thread about jewlery currently on HN). Not to mention increasing numbers of bullshit jobs. That system needs to go, it&#x27;s unsustainable.<p>Inequality and survivalism are not going away. Nor should they, really - what history showed us is that people don&#x27;t react well when forced to be equal. The drive to get more will always be there, but it doesn&#x27;t preclude us from raising the low point from &quot;starving to death&quot; to &quot;comfortable, if minimalist, life&quot;. Basics can totally be Communism 2.0 and let sulprus be whatever develops, only moderated so that it doesn&#x27;t go exponential.",1422284599

Most re-enactors I&#x27;ve met are either into the first or third one (or a mix thereof).<p>I see HEMA as a logical evolution of that third focus, though I personally find its emphasis on duelling and professional competitions (with all the restrictions that brings) less intriguing.<p>I guess my point is that you can have medieval combat without the &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; parts outside of HEMA as well. It&#x27;s very different from HEMA and certainly attracts a different kind of people, but it&#x27;s still an alternative even if you couldn&#x27;t care less about the theatrics.",1422284585

It&#x27;s graphite moderated, water is a neutron poison (+ positive void coefficient = outlawed in the the US by demand of Edward Teller, along with any but the newest of the CANDU designs), the pipes containing the fuel are vertical and can be individuality serviced, thanks of course due to its now notorious lack of containment.  Almost certainly intended as a dual use reactor, although I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if only some of them were used to breed plutonium.<p>I would hope we have more knowledge of e.g. the Indian and Pakistani nuke systems, then again the simple fact that 90% of the CIA&#x27;s employees work in the US is enough to make you highly skeptical of our nation&#x27;s HUMINT.  Then again we the US are primarily concerned with them falling into the wrong hands (a parochialism that does not enhance regional or ultimately world stability), and I heard back in the &#x27;80s from some friends who were in a position to know that we leaked to the Soviets everything they needed to know about Permissive Action Links to safeguard their nukes.  And this of course eventually devolves to a people problem ... a very good argument against NP.<p>As for your last point, while I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with it, I think the theory is that India isn&#x27;t going to forswear nukes (South Africa is the only nation that has after developing them), India isn&#x27;t an enemy, potential or real, like the other &quot;nuclear rogue states&quot; or likely ones in the future, so cozying up to them in this area is not going to produce the moral hazard WRT to the NPT and NP like, e.g., our tacit acceptance of Iran&#x27;s imminent completion of warheads.  And I&#x27;d note that on the other hand, our arranging the deposing and likely, although not inevitable death of Muammar Gaddafi demonstrated a very harsh lesson on giving up your WMD programs, undoing whatever good was done here WRT Saddam Hussein.<p>Of course, you could argue that the current situation with Iran is the sort of thing you&#x27;d expect by our not continuing an ultra hard line on NP.  Me, I&#x27;m going to continue to keep handy my copies of <i>Nuclear War Survival Skills</i> along with all the other stuff I collected during the Cold War, including my mother&#x27;s Civil Defense Block Mother sign, back from the late &#x27;60s when we still cared about the survival of the nation.",1422284529

Consistency is my most formidable bugbear, and I am trying to figure out what is stopping me from achieving it.<p>When I plan my days or weeks, scheduling has been very difficult, and I'm interested to see how the fit hackers out there have handled it, particularly those of you who have 9-to-5's (or similar) like me.<p>I have tried exercising before work, immediately after work, and in the evenings.  Each has had its own roadblocks:<p>Getting up early worked well, but I am a night person.  Trust me, I have tried it all: consistent wake-up times, quitting caffeine, UV light bulbs, redundant alarm systems.  If you can suggest a way to make it stick, please do.<p>Exercising immediately after my day job is tough.  I get home anywhere between 5:30 and 7:30PM; when I get home, I often feel like drawing/painting or coding, and it feels counterproductive to sacrifice creative productivity (a goal that is just as important to me), even in the name of fitness.  Also, if I want to do <i>anything</i> social and still get to bed at a reasonable time, then exercising for a significant duration is tough to sneak in before I go, and impossible if I get home from work too late.<p>Finally, nights are a problem because I sometimes have trouble sleeping too soon after I exercise, and it's much more difficult to muster the energy when winding down after a long day.<p>When do you work out?  How is your free time structured, and how much of it do you have?  Is there anything you did, or read, or saw, that worked extremely well or very poorly for you?<p>P.S. - I am aware that the best solution is to ""just do it"".  However, I have been attempting to ""just do it"" for the last 3 years.  I am also aware that there is no try, only do.  However, I currently appear to be <i>unable</i> to ""just do it"", and my intention in posting this question is to see how other people curated their environments and daily routines in such a way that they were more likely to be consistent.  Balancing a day job, ambitious personal projects, personal fitness and a social life is very difficult; we need all the information we can get.",1296165558

2149647,comment,2148460,2148460,0,0,cgopalan,,,"Its almost eerie (in a positive way) that I see this post right when I was thinking about something along the lines of how an effective engineering course should be structured. Only recently I developed an interest in the classics (greek and roman) and also started reading Milton's ""Paradise lost"", and Seneca's ""On the shortness of life"". Two things stood out in a lot of these works - 1) the richness of content - meaning how inevitably it makes you think hard while reading, and 2) the usage of language in a way that makes you see the language in a whole new light (especially in Milton's classic - English never looked so beautiful!!). During the process of reading these classics, I was convinced that a 3-4 year study of an engineering (or science) discipline would only be vastly improved if the subject matter had its share of philosophy and literature (call it ""lit-phil""). I would go so far as to say that it should be a 50-50 split. There There will always be a debate as to what works should be included, but the amount of quality work is so vast that being selective would not matter. We can argue that to incorporate this into the same 3-4 years of study, we could eliminate some of the engineering course material to make way. Do we really need all those engineering subjects in that much detail?<p>So then should be an arts degree at all? I would say yes, and thats only for people who just feel overwhelmed by science or engineering (who I come across aplenty) and prefer to study only the arts. If there should be an arts-only degree, why would I propose that engineering be always accompanied by study of lit-phil? Simply because I believe that a mind that needs to grasp engineering has to be somewhat prepared by philosophy and literature and whetted constantly by it during the study.<p>Now, the only kicker is that at the age of doing a bachelors (which is between 17-19 and 21-23 for the majority), the average engineering bachelor student would not be mature enough to appreciate a healthy dosage of lit-phil. They would inevitably ask why they are being subjected to something totally unrelated - whereas they do not understand that the subject matter is slowly working on their brain in the background (if they care to put an effort into it).<p>Hope this does not come across as a rant against engineering. I studied electrical engineering and have utmost regard for the field (much more so than ""software engineering"" - and I am not talking about computer science and engineering here). But I believe its crucial to pay attention to how we inculcate that engineering knowledge into minds in general. And develop engineers that are not afraid to think and contemplate.",1296164916

The Japanese then moved their Central Force through the gap and attacked the much smaller and ill-prepared Seventh Fleet.<p>The commander of the Seventh Fleet sent several desperate messages asking for Halsey's help, causing Admiral Nimitz at Pearl Harbor to send a message to Halsey asking, simply ""WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR?"" (Task Force 34 was the Third Fleet's detachment of battleships).<p>His clerk changed the message to WHERE IS RPT WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR? And then, while forming the message, added the beginning nonce ""TURKEY TROTS TO WATER GG"" and the trailing nonce ""RR THE WORLD WONDERS"". The ""GG"" and ""RR"" were indicators of the end and beginning of the nonces.<p>Halsey's clerk removed the first nonce, but left the last one ""THE WORLD WONDERS"" as part of the message, apparently missing the ""RR"". So when Halsey got the message, it read ""WHERE IS RPT WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR THE WORLD WONDERS"".<p>Halsey interpreted the message as sarcastic criticism of his decisions by a commanding officer over official channels, and flew into a rage. He then decided to delay the Third Fleet's assistance of the Seventh Fleet, ostensibly to refuel his destroyers.<p>Had he sent the battleships immediately, they likely would have crossed the Central Force's T and crushed them. It  would have been one of the greatest (and last) battleship duels in history.<p>Of course the blunder didn't affect the outcome of the war, or even the battle in a strategic since. The Seventh Fleet was able to turn the Central Force back, mostly through self-sacrificial courage on the part of the destroyer crews.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_world_wonders"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_world_wonders</a>",1296162854

The driving force of modern industrial civilization has been individual material gain, which is accepted as legitimate, even praiseworthy, on the grounds that private vices yield public benefits, in the classic formulation.<p>Now, it has long been understood, very well, that a society that is based on this principle will destroy itself in time. It can only persist, with whatever suffering and injustice that it entails, as long as it is possible to pretend that the destructive forces that humans create are limited, that the world is an infinite resource, and that the world is an infinite garbage can.<p>At this stage of history either one of two things is possible. Either the general population will take control of its own destiny and will concern itself with community interests, guided by values of solidarity, sympathy and concern for others, or alternatively there will be no destiny for anyone to control. As long as some specialized class is in a position of authority, it is going to set policy in the special interests that it serves.<p>But the conditions of survival, let alone justice, require rational social planning in the interests of the community as a whole, and by now that means the global community. The question is whether privileged elite should dominate mass communication and should use this power as they tell us they must -- namely to impose necessary illusions, to manipulate and deceive the stupid majority and remove them from the public arena.<p>The question in brief, is whether democracy and freedom are values to be preserved or threats to be avoided. In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than values to be treasured; they may well be essential to survival.<p>~Noam Chomsky, from ""Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media"" 1992",1296162232

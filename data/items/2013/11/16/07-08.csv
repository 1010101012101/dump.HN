6744113,comment,6743019,6744074,5,0,FLUX-YOU,,,"The goalposts were clearly moved in a big and sudden way. Parental wisdom became worthless at worst and uncertain at least because no one knew what the economy was going to do (least of all parents that weren&#x27;t economically aware). They continued with the same advice while the landscape changed drastically. Even if high school graduates did their own research, they would&#x27;ve still needed to be able to predict the outcome of an world economy after a huge shake-up -- how is someone fresh out of high school supposed to do that?<p>I mean, I agree that a Sociology degree isn&#x27;t known for 6 figures, but before things went tits up, it would&#x27;ve likely gotten you a decent office job somewhere -- certainly you&#x27;re capable of more than bagging groceries and stocking shelves. A Master&#x27;s used to convey a certain amount of willingness to work, learn, and accomplish something. It was a certain amount of mold-able competency that transformed depending on what position you were given.<p>Now it <i>suddenly</i> isn&#x27;t worth as much. It would&#x27;ve been another thing entirely if this was a slow shift, which would give society, businesses, and students time to adjust. Now that general usefulness is trash and you&#x27;re better off partying to network.<p>The next generation will be able to research what happened, and they&#x27;ll get more cautious advice, but that wisdom came at a pretty high price.",1384588616

You can&#x27;t start with a language that lacks memory safety and add it later. Nor can you start with a language that uses global concurrent GC and try to reel it back in without losing safety. C++ is in the former category and I think there is no way for them to add memory safety at this point. Languages in the latter category really have no way of going back on global concurrent GC; the entire ecosystem is built around garbage collection.<p>Safe manual memory management is balanced on a very delicate precipice.

We can agree to disagree, but let me make a few more points first :-) I&#x27;ll be civil I promise.<p>He didn&#x27;t get life for stealing the truck. he got life for stealing the truck in addition to the 2 other convictions. It&#x27;s also not &quot;any severity,&quot; but felony level severity. You can argue that the line in the sand has been drawn in the wrong place, but the line in the sand is for bad offenses. Stealing a chocolate bar is not a felony, it is a misdemeanor (pretty much everywhere as far as I can tell. Generally speaking, shoplifting is not a felony until is it several hundred dollars worth, usually $500).[1]<p>You can argue that the &quot;felony&quot; label is too broadly applied to things that aren&#x27;t &quot;that bad.&quot; You can argue that life is too harsh of a punishment. Those are reasonable arguments. But in general, felonies are &quot;severe&quot; and not comparable to speeding tickets or chocolate bars.<p>>Realistically if the first two strikes were horrendous the person would already be put in jail for life and a long time. There would be no opportunity for a third strike. By your logic, the courts got it wrong the first two times and now they are getting it right with the life sentence.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more along the lines of we&#x27;ll give you a couple chances, but only a couple. 1, go to jail for awhile and think about what you&#x27;ve done. 2, I told you not to do that and you kept doing it anyways think about it longer. 3. Dude, seriously. We warned you, and now we&#x27;ve had enough.<p>Some felonies on their own are in fact worthy of life. Murder someone and you generally get life. They idea behind 3 strikes is that on their own maybe they aren&#x27;t worth that long of a sentence, but they are bad and we gave you several chances.<p>>Also, I am sorry, personally for me 20-30 years in jail is as good as life.<p>perhaps. how about 10-15? I have no idea what the &quot;right&quot; amount of time for any crime is. All I&#x27;m suggesting is that it isn&#x27;t that unreasonable to have that time scale for people who repeatedly prove that they aren&#x27;t being productive members of society.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://examples.yourdictionary.com/what-are-examples-of-felonies-misdemeanors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://examples.yourdictionary.com/what-are-examples-of-felo...</a>",1384586900

The recent attacks (BEAST, CRIME, etc.) have all relied on being able to build an oracle from (sent) body content and uncover header elements. The attacks only get better in time, so I expect to see even more attacks like this.<p>If we&#x27;re going to overhaul the HTTP spec in any case and go for framed messaging - why not go for separate header/body compression AND separate encryption keys? As far as I understand, that would block the whole family of attacks. Separate compression contexts would prevent the attacker from building an oracle from body to attack the header. Separate keys and encryption contexts should prevent padding and mode oracles against the header.<p>I know crypto is hard, and I <i>know</i> there would be devilishly tricky details to figure out. So I have to assume someone has already thought of this, has had it vetted out for flaws and then discarded the idea.<p>But if so, why?

7616186,comment,7615750,7616178,32,0,pcwalton,,,"It wouldn&#x27;t work in Rust because &quot;let&quot; supports arbitrary (irrefutable) patterns, and Rust has full pattern matching. The parser has to know when a pattern is coming up. Languages that use :=, like Go, don&#x27;t have a complete set of destructuring features. The convenience of being able to have an arbitrary pattern in &quot;let&quot; bindings far outweighs the disadvantage of having to type &quot;let&quot;.<p>&quot;x : mut = expression&quot; wouldn&#x27;t work in Rust because types follow :, and &quot;mut&quot; is not part of a type. &quot;mut&quot; is needed after each binding because one pattern can contain some mutable bindings and some immutable bindings.",1397980592

While implementation has its occasional flaws and bugs, specification does have defined on/off state, not many optional layers in between.<p>We can make any communication channel secure, by adding layers of encryption, no problem with that. But unless it is defined deep down as a part of the standard, it all ends with no security at all and no means to be sure what happened with the message along the way.<p>Having headers exposed is one of the reasons why I raised initial concern. It is part of the specification and unlikely to go away by building on top of the standard.",1397977828
7616125,comment,7615903,7615903,20,0,chm,,,"Under atmospheric pressure, ethanol melts at -114C. One way to &quot;powderize&quot; it is to make it into an ester, which in this case would be an ethyl ester[1,2]. Hydrolysis of the ester will occur under acidic conditions which would be brought about by dissolution of carbonic acid. The latter decomposes in acidic conditions to form CO2 and 2 protons. Ester hydrolysis in acidic conditions is reversible. This would explain why they claim their product to contain ~50% ethanol by weight: they need a lot so that the equilibrium concentration is at around 5%.<p>Assuming my guessing is correct, the innovation here is in the ester. They must have used a &quot;safe, food grade&quot; carboxylic acid to pass certifications. All the powder contains is probably:<p>- Food dye<p>- Flavor<p>- Carbonic acid<p>- Some ethyl ester<p>EDIT: A human stomach is also acidic. Ester hydrolysis in alkaline conditions isn&#x27;t reversible (saponification). If our stomach were alkaline, drinking Palcohol would be very dangerous. The alcohol content in the stomach would skyrocket even if it were low in the drink.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/esters/hydrolysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/esters/hydrolysis.ht...</a>",1397977810

Retained earnings are not meant to be paid out as dividends if they can significantly increase shareholder value. This is even more true for startups where you are seeking a &quot;hockey stick growth&quot; model. Especially when you consider what is more important at a given time: profit, revenue, users, market share, uniques, etc. I would argue that it&#x27;s important for a startup to be transparent around all these issues and help investors understand where you are at. It&#x27;s unfortunate that startups can only rely on financing rounds to get updated valuations of their business. Coming up with internal valuations based on arbitrary multiples that are not validated by investors could be a slippery slope and thus are not worth considering.",1397977282

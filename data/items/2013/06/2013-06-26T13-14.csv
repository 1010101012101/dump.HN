They&#x27;ve become more wily and would rather people fall into servitude than fail completely.<p>When capitalism broke down in 1929-33, people actually died of starvation. Now they go into high-interest credit card debt.<p>The same is happening in higher education. The need for widespread higher education is too strong for people to just not go, but the upper class isn&#x27;t going to just give it away (even if there is benefit to them of an educated society). Thus, non-dischargeable loans have replaced taxpayer-funded grants, and college is <i>just</i> at the point of affordability where the upper class feels comfortable with the number of people who can go to school.",1372253333

The government has always been involved in every facet of the University of Washington as it is run by the government.  You seem to be claiming that because the government dropped their share of covering a student&#x27;s tuition from 90% to 30% and allowed them to take out a loan instead, they were suddenly willing to pay a lot more money to go to school, which is absurd.<p>You don&#x27;t give nearly enough credit to what you call &quot;other contributing factors.&quot;  What happened was an economic sea change.  Years ago upon graduating high school you had options.  You could go get a job in manufacturing and make good money right away and live a solid middle class life.  For many, college was an unattractive option.  Today, our manufacturing base has been destroyed.  When you graduate high school today, what options do you have besides go to college?  There are simply not enough good paying jobs that don&#x27;t require a college degree to go around.  Not even close.<p>I think ultimately you are mixing up cause and effect.  The government is involved in the student loan business because college education has increasingly become the only path to a middle class life.  Our education policy is reactive, not proactive.

In doing so, he rejects all of modern liberal humanism. “The evidence of science and history,” he writes, “is that humans are only ever partly and intermittently rational, but for modern humanists the solution is simple: human beings must in future be more reasonable. These enthusiasts for reason have not noticed that the idea that humans may one day be more rational requires a greater leap of faith than anything in religion.”<p>This just seems like empty rhetoric.<p>Some people are more rational than those in the past - and we&#x27;ve learnt a lot about cognitive biases, and about how to have productive conversations. I don&#x27;t think it requires a particularly great leap of faith to believe that people <i>may</i> one day be more rational.<p>It&#x27;s not a sure thing mind. But to go from a prescriptive must, to a may, to then saying that oh it&#x27;s never going to happen. The evidence of science and history here may as well read &#x27;It&#x27;s common knowledge that...&#x27; a phrase that doesn&#x27;t really support anything.<p>> “Technical progress,” writes Gray, again in Straw Dogs, “leaves only one problem unsolved: the frailty of human nature. Unfortunately that problem is insoluble.”<p>Because, hey, I say it is.<p>> Humanists believe that humanity improves along with the growth of knowledge, but the belief that the increase of knowledge goes with advances in civilization is an act of faith. They see the realization of human potential as the goal of history, when rational inquiry shows history to have no goal. They exalt nature, while insisting that humankind—an accident of nature—can overcome the natural limits that shape the lives of other animals.<p>Straw man.<p>#<p><i>sigh</i><p>I mean, look, I appreciate this is meant to be a book review, but in that role it&#x27;s really bad.

Colleges then had the green light to perpetually raise prices - even in the depths of the great recession - they knew Uncle Sam would cover the bill. Education costs have had no connection to reality because you could get a government backed loan for it. When you see an entire industry, with plenty of competition amongst schools, disconnecting from reality, you can almost always bet the government is involved in the cost inflation.<p>Colleges then took that massive influx of government sponsored cash and put it to work funding their bureaucracies, building an endless parade of buildings they didn&#x27;t actually need, significantly boosting professor pay, and accumulating substantial endowments.<p>Meanwhile the actual education - their product - did not get more valuable. At a time of terrible economic performance, with 14% real unemployment, falling incomes, and lack of jobs post graduation, clearly the cost of an education should have fallen by quite a lot. It didn&#x27;t because of a guaranteed loan back stop.<p>There is talk now that students should pay the same low interest rates on their debt that banks pay when they borrow money. If that is put into effect, all it will do is accelerate the debt accumulation. It&#x27;ll enable students to borrow more, and colleges will accordingly charge more.

I had so many processes starting with &quot;node /....&quot; that it was a real pain to track what was doing what, which one to restart, which ones are zombies, etc etc. I won&#x27;t lie, this is actually one of the reason I was still hacking the backend with python/django.. the virtualenv, gunicorn and supervisor just made it awesome. I&#x27;ll definitely give PM2 a try though.<p>To other node.js users: How do you cope with this problem? I know friends who by-pass all this by using heroku (or similar platform), is that what you do? What about managing multiple node projects on a single linode instance?",1372251642

If an interviewer gives you feedback, and they say something wrong, it could open the company up to a discrimination lawsuit.<p>You&#x27;re better off asking questions about the business and trying to determine whether they&#x27;re a good fit for you than you are deciding whether they&#x27;re impressed by you or not. By assessing their business and their fit for you, you&#x27;ll decide whether you want to accept any offer they may or may not decide to offer. If they don&#x27;t offer, they weren&#x27;t impressed, and they still shouldn&#x27;t provide you much feedback because of aforementioned liability issues.

Due to the confidence in my Accounting and Finance classes, I really started to stand out among my peers. It led to a promotion to a lead developer and then I was nominated for my company&#x27;s &quot;Emerging Leader&quot; program (open to less than 2% of employees).<p>I have since parlayed it into a director of software development job at a small tech company. When I met with the founder and the management my MBA was a key reason why they offered me the salary I wanted. I get to sit in the management meetings and talk about marketing, pricing, hiring and team size. My Strategy class has given me a framework for focusing on our strengths. My Finance classes have given me an understanding of how to value different projects and their resulting cashflows. My Accounting classes have given me the ability to speak the language of business. My marketing classes have allowed me to talk about market segments and understand why the Marketing team is so insistent that we keep a brand message consistent throughout our products.<p>> Do you think it would be worthwhile for someone in my position to do an MBA considering I don&#x27;t feel like you did?<p>I think I&#x27;d approach I&#x27;d ask myself the following questions:<p>* Do I keep quiet in meetings because I lack certainty or confidence about what the business people are saying?<p>* Do I have 4-6 hours a week for the next 2-3 years I can spend on class and coursework?<p>* Do I anticipate leading a software team someday or founding a company?<p>* Do I struggle to gain credibility with influential people?<p>* Do I think I&#x27;d like to teach at a community college or higher?<p>* Do I lack the motivation to read intentionally, forcing myself to really understand and absorb the information?<p>If you answer yes to 4 or more of these I think you could benefit from an MBA. I think you could get a lot of the knowledge by reading books from Drucker, Levinson, Carnegie, and Collins. I read a lot of these books too, before I started taking MBA classes. I had knowledge, but didn&#x27;t have confidence (or a fuller understanding).<p>Sorry for the long-winded reply...hopefully it&#x27;s helpful.",1450407168

10756228,comment,10754487,10754487,0,0,clickok,,,"We just had a series of debates/discussions on this topic at my university, the results of which were pretty inconclusive. \nThere are just too many possible scenarios which seem to require different responses, and in most cases to provide those responses is to answer philosophical questions that have been around for millennia.<p>The strategies for mitigating risk seem to be: ensure that the AIs are controllable; avoid situations where there is a single AI (whether controlled or uncontrolled) that is too powerful; and ensure that the AI&#x27;s goals are broadly acceptable to humankind.<p>The first and the third objectives are extremely difficult, not just technically, but even from a conceptual standpoint[1]. \nThe second strategy is reasonable, because even if a superhuman intelligence were somehow well controlled, depending on who controls it the outcomes could vary significantly.\nSo perhaps the best thing we can hope for is something similar to society&#x27;s current status quo-- lots of power concentrated in few hands[2], but without one single (person|corporation|government) being so dominant as to be able to act in opposition to all others.<p>I am not confident that we will ever be able to produce a provably safe AI, or that we could get even a large majority of the world&#x27;s population to agree on what a &quot;good AI&quot; might do without devolving into ineffectual generalities[3].\nSupposing that resolving these questions is not prima facie impossible, it&#x27;s not like retarding AI development comes without cost-- just about every facet of our lives can be improved via AI, and so in the years, decades, or centuries between when superhuman machine intelligence is theoretically achievable and the time when we collectively agree we can implement it safely, how many billions will suffer or die from things that we could&#x27;ve solved via AI[4]?<p>On the whole, OpenAI sounds like a good idea. \nMaking research broadly available helps avoid catastrophic &quot;singleton&quot; like futures, while accelerating the progress we make in the present. \nIn addition, if there&#x27;s every an AI SDK with effective methods of improving how &quot;safe&quot; a given AI is, most researchers would likely incorporate that into their work.\nIt might not be &quot;proven safe&quot;, but if there was a means to shut down a runaway process, or stop it from spreading to the Internet, or alert someone when it starts constructing androids shaped like Austrian bodybuilders, that would be handy.\nResponsible researchers should be doing this already, but as Scott points out the ones we should be worried about aren&#x27;t responsible researchers. \nOpen AI development is in harmony with safe AI development, at least in some respects.<p>------<p>1. I have a significantly longer response that I scrapped because it might ultimately be better suited as a blog post or some such.<p>2. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called a power law distribution. Well, no, that&#x27;s not it at all, but it seemed like a funny, flippant thing to say.<p>3. A universally beloved AI might be the equivalent of a Chinese Room where regardless of what message you send it, it responds with a vaguely complimentary yet motivational apothegm.<p>4. Bostrom tends to counterbalance this by arguing how much of our light cone (the &quot;cosmic endowment&quot;) we might lose out on if we end up going extinct, due to, e.g., superhuman machine intelligence.\nCertainly &quot;all of configurations of spacetime reachable from this point&quot; outweighs the suffering of mere billions of people by some evaluations, but I ask myself &quot;how much do I care about people thousands or millions of years into the future?&quot;, and also &quot;if these guys have such a good handle on what constitutes the &#x27;right&#x27; utility function, why haven&#x27;t they shared it?&quot;.\nA more sarcastic variation of the above might be to remark that if they&#x27;re able to approximate what people want with such high fidelity that they feel comfortable performing relativistic path integration over possible futures, then superintelligence is already here.<p>------",1450405670

It&#x27;s useful for discovering idioms you didn&#x27;t know, even if you already knew another way. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> useful if you&#x27;re trying to do bookmarklets/extensions/mashups or even more significantly engineered interop.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a formal gatekeeper out there with a list of all the things that capital-O Officially make the The Open Web(TM) great, so I guess there&#x27;s no way to settle what&#x27;s on it.<p>But I don&#x27;t know how anyone could argue that these things weren&#x27;t significant bullet points in a much longer list of reasons why the web has seen faster and broader adoption than any of the competing VMs and why it was/is often more useful and nice to work with despite more limited capabilities.<p>And I think it goes almost without saying that list is much bigger than the &quot;no single gatekeeper&quot; point.<p>> you&#x27;re fighting against WebAssembly because you are ideologically against black box software<p>I am neither fighting against WebAssembly nor ideologically against any kind of black box software. My earlier comment makes it clear I think WebAssembly has a place (and, more generally, that transpiling does) as well as its hazards.<p>I <i>am</i> stepping in to point out that Flash and WebAssembly have significant things in common, some of which are tradeoffs against things that have made the Web an effective and proliferating medium.<p>> [JS] some important deficiencies with respect to typing and static analysis<p>See my aside about Elm. Given the fact that dynamic languages (including maligned ones like JS and even PHP) seem to be about as equally successful in terms of shipped software as statically manifest typed languages, whether or not even something like TypeScript is really going to give engineering teams an edge seems like far from a settled question to me. But I&#x27;m interested to see what happens where we&#x27;re talking significantly augmented capabilities rather than the largely aesthetic differences that something like CoffeeScript represents.<p>(Speaking of which: &quot;TypeScript, Flow, Dart, CoffeeScript&quot;... at least one of these things is not like the others if you&#x27;re invoking static analysis and typing as reasons for transpiling.)<p>> You say that other people&#x27;s problems with JS are &quot;superficial&quot;, but that&#x27;s exactly how I see your problems with WebAssembly.<p>I can&#x27;t tell exactly what you&#x27;re saying here, but at a close approximation, it sounds like you might be suggesting that the readability of WebAssembly is going to be on the same order of difficulty that an experienced Python developer has reading idiomatic human-written JS (ie, aesthetic). This is <i>potentially</i> possible, I guess, in a world where everyone writing compilers that target WebAssembly is conscientious at/above the level that the CoffeeScript developers were (CS output is really fairly readable, arguably more so than minified JS). But then again, that&#x27;s not what the name suggests WebAssembly is for. In practice, most of the time it&#x27;s probably going to read... a lot like assembly language dressed in C-like syntax.",1450404410

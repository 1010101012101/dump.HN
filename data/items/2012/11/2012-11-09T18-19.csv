4764216,comment,4762865,4763353,24,0,curiousDog,,,"I strongly disagree. I grew up in uganda as an expat's kid (age 1-15). I used to play everyday with a lot of kids in the neighborhood. I was the only one with an actual fifa ball and they always waited for me with giddy eyes to show up on the local grounds despite having their own ingenious banana bark and kavera (plastic bag) balls. 
I made sure to give each one of them a ball when i left and most of them still treasured them when i went back a year ago.
Sometimes it's not about a warm and fuzzy feeling. You have to see first hand how these kids live.",1352487539

4764204,comment,4764028,4764028,3,0,jawns,,,"Actually, there are tremendous practical reasons why a religion would include sexual ethics into its moral code.<p>Prime example: Fidelity within marriage (one of the Ten Commandments).  People who cheat on their spouses not only do damage to their relationship, but also increase their own (and their spouse's) risk of being infected with a sexually transmitted disease.<p>Look at some of the sex-related stuff in Leviticus, like the prohibition on having sex while a woman has her period.  Turns out, a woman is at greater risk of getting an STD during this time.  So, like the Jewish dietary laws, this prohibition actually helped keep the Jewish people (relatively) healthy.<p>Or look at the religious rationale for prohibiting prostitution: It treats the prostitute (often a woman) as an object rather than a person with innate dignity, and even in cases where the prostitute is making a seemingly free choice to engage in the transaction, there are often hidden pressures (addiction, mental illness, a pimp) that affect her ability to make a truly free choice.<p>Those are just three small examples, but there are many others.",1352487414

When you're just starting up a new project ideally you want to just boot your database up and start throwing data at it without worrying about schema. However with other products on the market, most notably Mongo, there are a lot of features that stop working when you get to a large scale. We've been very careful in developing RethinkDB to make sure that small teams who use our product aren't going to need to rewrite code once their dataset starts growing. As coffeemug mentions above we support fully parallelized queries. This means that when your dataset grows you can add more servers to speed up analytic queries. We feel this a valuable feature for small teams.",1352487198

4764182,comment,4763586,4763586,2,0,mixmax,,,"This might be slightly off-topic, but am I the only one that thinks that command line tools are archaic with some pretty serious drawbacks? I see and acknowledge the power they can wield in the right hands, but for mere mortals it's a terrible experience. Especially on a windows box.<p>I've started learning Symfony2, and the default is to get it up and running using the dependancy manager composer, a commandline based tool. I've spent a week trying to finish the simple task of installing the framework. No success. Now, I don't make a living programming, so I'm definitely at the shallow end of the programming pool. But still. A week.<p>There are several problems as I see it:<p>- No discoverability. You are given no clues whatsoever as to what commands are available to you. You have to know exactly what you want to do. Yes, you can read manpages, forum posts, etc. but finding, learning and memorising a whole set of commands used in some program you might never use again seems like a terrible waste of productive time. Without the manual you're flying blind.<p>- All sorts of opaque dependencies. Composer for instance apparently requires git installed for it to work. But it doesn't say that anywhere. You also need to define paths, etc. which isn't covered anywhere.<p>- A million minor flaws and bugs. Until now I've run up against at least a few bugs, either in composer or in some other part of the chain of software. Only opaque general warnings are given, and finding out exactly what is wrong is next to impossible.<p>- Terrible UI. Copying and pasting doesn't follow convention, copying from a commandline to a notepad inserts linebreaks that you have to clean up manually, there's no way to maximise the cmd.exe window. The list of basic usability flaws goes on.<p>This isn't meant as trolling or ranting, although I must say I'm genuinely alienated by the commandline. I understand that text is  great way for programs to talk to each other, I understand that the commandline is a great way to talk to a remote server, and I understand the power that piping, etc. gives you, so it's not like I'm denouncing the power that's inherent in the tool.<p>The problem is that the learning curve is tremendously steep, and I just don't feel it's worth it. To do the simplest thing I need to learn how a whole ecosystem works. I also have to page the information I need together from a number of different sources that I first have to find. It's kind of like having to build a car just to ride down to the baker to get some bread. It's quicker to walk than assemble a car before you can drive.",1352487132

If you're ok with out of date results, you can do that too without paying the price of consistency guarantees.

Individuals can participate in the OWS loan purchases until they run into the wall (i.e., their ability to participate in the purchase or to make further gifts).  Note that this is why I assume the OWS loan forgiveness is treated as a gift--because in the above scenario, that is clearly the intent.<p>Alternatively, OWS would purchase the loan itself and then forgive the loan.

All jobs as a lawyer require law school.  About 70% of people who get law degrees will successfully pass the bar, and get a high paying job they otherwise couldn't and be able to pay their debts.  About 30% will fail to pass a bar, and be put on that track, with the result that their best available jobs are much lower paying and they are hosed.<p>Did that 30% make a bad decision to go to law school?  If so, then so did a lot of the other 70%, because it is not obvious going in who will and won't succeed.  Most of the time, law school is a good choice.  Some of the time it is a terrible choice.<p>Complicating the issue even farther, very few people going into law school are aware of how high the odds are of getting into serious debt problems.  Until recently there was little public awareness of it, and marketing materials from law schools certainly make no mention of the issue.<p>(I'm pulling up this particular example because unsuccessful law graduates make up a high portion of seriously distressed student debt, and there have been lawsuits about false advertising around this issue.)",1352485864

4764066,comment,4760995,4763158,2,0,mseebach,,,"From the linked website (""Why we strike debt""):<p><i>$1 trillion of student debt. 64% of all bankruptcies caused by medical debt. 5 million homes foreclosed already, another 5 million in default or foreclosure. Credit card debt is $800 billion, generating an average 16.24% interest on money banks borrow at 3.25%.</i><p>First, they seem to fail to understand that the reason credit card debt is marked up from bank debt is that there's a fairly significant risk it's not getting paid back. Later on the same page, they state that 10% is written off as irrecoverable.<p>Second, ""Vast majority"" might have been artistic license, and I meant to refer to distressed debt - plenty of people use credit for completely reasonable things and service those loans, or have them restructured in good faith. Student debt is also mostly in that category. In other words, those loans will never be available for OWS to purchase for cents on the dollar.<p>That said, I'm not at all sure bankruptcies are a meaningful proxy for what kinds of debts are outstanding. Certainly, loans bankrupted on aren't included in this project, as they will already have been ""forgiven"". I couldn't find a good source (indeed, any source), but I would be very surprised if various bits of consumer credit (credit cards, car loans, store credit etc) aren't a very major chunk of the debt available for OWS to buy.<p>If OWS singled out medical debt and perhaps even some student loans, or made some other effort to review them to make sure they fit a moral prerequisite for having been screwed by ""the 1%"", I'd be sympathetic to the project. Instead, they are paying off random strangers credit card bill, while honest people who pay off their credit cards, even when it hurts, are passed over.",1352485770

This basically means donations are currently being wasted. If this wasted money can be redirected into something which will not be wasted, that seems like a definite win.<p>Further, balls are not just used for neighborhood games, but by organizations which use football as a tool for reaching other goals. If these organization are at all helpful, scrounging in the trash for materials to make balls is probably not a good use of their time. An organization may need dozens of balls, and if a trash ball only lasts for an hour (just a guess, I've never played football with a trash ball), then they may need over a hundred of them <i>a day</i>. The opportunity cost of the time spent making trash balls is probably higher than the cost of these balls, especially if they can truly last for years.<p>You could apply the same thinking about opportunity cost to the children's time. If play is important for children and if making balls out of trash is not play, then giving them more time to focus on play is a win.<p>Having cool things seems to be universally enjoyable. This gives the children something cool, probably adding to the fun of playing.<p>Digging in the trash is probably a lot less safe than playing football.<p>According to the corporation's website, 20 million deflated balls are discarded in Africa every year. If these balls last longer, there will be an environmental impact.<p>And finally, the main ways other charity attempts backfire (economic damage, not meeting the whole need [providing things the community can't maintain/support], giving a fish instead of teaching to fish, etc) seem to just not apply.",1352485028

Database system differ on what they make easy, not what they make possible. We spent an enormous amount of time on building the low-level architecture and working on a seamless user experience. If you play with the product, I think you'll see these differences right away.<p>Note: rethink is a new product, so it'll inevitably have quirks.

You will have to send <i>plasma-desktop</i> to the float layer.  It's best if you make xmonad act like an EWMH compatible WM by using the <i>EwmhDesktops</i> [1] log hook and I think the <i>ManageDocks</i> [2] manage hook also played a role. The relevant xmonad.hs changes are:<p><pre><code>    import XMonad.Hooks.ManageDocks

This is an all too common attitude and one I used to share before spending time in the developing world.

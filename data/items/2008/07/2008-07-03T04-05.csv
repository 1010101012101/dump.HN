234900,comment,234712,234872,0,0,gruseom,,,"Pundits are largely hacks. Hitchens seems to me more in the tradition of the public intellectual (I think Orwell's a fair reference point). He's <i>in</i> the media game but not nearly as much <i>of</i> it as, say, David Brooks. He's also pretty fearless about breaking the rules. Pundits don't do that.<p>I'm really not as big a fan of Hitchens as my comment made it sound. There's just one thing that makes me giddy and that is his fabulous English style. That exquisite combination of literacy and wit really does belong to a great lineage, and I love it. That's probably why the reference to ""Vanity Fair writer"" got my goat. Todd Purdum is a Vanity Fair writer. Christopher Hitchens is Christopher Hitchens.<p>Since I'm already going on and on about this (and well into baitland for the !HN crowd), I have a couple questions. I'd love to hear some credible answers if anyone's game. So: among the pundit and journalist classes,<p>1. Who else would have the integrity or the balls to have himself waterboarded in order to be able to write meaningfully about torture?<p>2. Who else would, or could, ever write something like this: <i>Stone earned himself constant surveillance from an already hostile F.B.I. until the foul racist and pervert J. Edgar Hoover finally turned into carrion on a full-time basis in 1972.</i><p>Doesn't sound like punditry to me!",1215060415

234896,comment,234763,234778,0,0,gojomo,,,"The confusion over this issue springs from the overloading of voting as both ""promote/demote"" (community appropriateness) and ""agree/disagree"" (personal opinion).<p>It's easy to understand why a 'demote' should be withheld once the community goal of deemphasizing a inappropriate comment has been reached.<p>It's harder to understand why someone should withhold their personal opinion, simply because they were later to vote. To the extent the net score is an opinion poll, more votes are more representative, no matter how late they arrive.<p>These two sometimes-conflicting senses could be split into two axes of community feedback, one promote(up)/demote(down), the other agree/disagree. Agree/disagree would be shown as a different score, or tiny sparkline-like bars reflecting not just the net value but the separate agree/disagrees totals. Then people would have an outlet for 'piling on' with personal opinions without unwanted karmic or order-of-display impact.<p>This might also serve to highlight some interesting classes of comments: those respected (upvoted) but generally disagreed-with, or those with high simultaneous levels of both agreement or disagreement. (Right now there's no way to tell if a comment scored 1 has no votes, or 20 upvotes and 20 downvotes.)<p>(My previous comments suggesting the same can be found via <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=214521"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=214521</a> .)",1215060227

On weekends I'll typically do 10-12hrs on the startup.  So ~70-72 hours.<p>So what helps the most?  Good Sleep... and Timeboxing - Focus into an activity and disconnect when your time is up.  I make sure my mornings take an hour, don't rush, and relax and center myself for the day.  Going to the gym is an awesome energy boost and stress reliever.  And finally, similar to my morning, I set aside an hour at night away from the TV, computer, etc. to just relax and disconnect from the day.  I need sleep, and this gets me 8 solid hours each night.<p>On weekends I'll hang out with friends at night and limit any drinking as much as possible.  Really though the foundation is a good sleep... if I'm not getting the 8-9hrs I'll scale back everything and get my sleep in order first before resuming the busy work schedule.",1215059443

234881,comment,234165,234165,0,0,tmarman,,,"Good advice from ajross and pg. The fact that they don't have an option plan in place suggests that it's definitely very early stages. What level of funding do they have? Especially if you're that early, you should DEFINITELY be seeking equity.<p>To put it in perspective, we just made our first non-founder employee - a senior developer - and we gave up 4% to get him. It's on the high side, but as a first hire and someone who we didn't want to lose, we were willing to give that up.<p>That said, the legal costs with creating an option plan (and registering for business in the state if it's a DE corporation) are not insignificant. Especially if they don't have much money yet, and want to spend that mostly on talent, that can be a factor here.<p>If they haven't done an equity round yet (i.e., valued the company), then the stock is effectively worthless (par value is probably $0.001 per share or something in that range, and normally you would see something like 5M shares authorized and outstanding). So in this scenario, an option with this strike price is effectively the same as an equity grant.<p>We were lucky - we're doing our initial stock purchase agreements now (we incorporated awhile back but had to redistribute some equity as involvement with co-founders changed) and we were able to include our first hire in that plan. We all have the same vesting schedule - 4 yrs prorated with a 1yr cliff - but our initial dates are a year or so earlier than his. This saved us at least 5k in legal fees.<p>My advice would be, like ajross and pg suggested, to negotiate what equity will be granted - even if they don't yet have the means to grant. And, if they wanted, they could also sell you shares under the same original purchase agreement (assuming they have a vesting schedule they're happy with, and they had some authorized but unissued shares).<p>Basically, if you want the job and like the company, take it - but if you don't negotiate the equity now (even if it can't be executed yet) then don't expect it later.",1215059121

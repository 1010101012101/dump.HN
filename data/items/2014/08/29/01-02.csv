I&#x27;m reminded of how Apple was developing a tablet computer, what would eventually become the iPad, far before anyone was thinking about multi-touch interfaces (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad#History</a>). They spent almost 10 years in R&D before they were able to put <i>something</i> out there, and even longer before they could actually ship the iPad. It&#x27;s a good thing they wasted all that money, because it ended up paying off.<p>I think Google, Amazon and even Microsoft are hedging similar bets against the limits of technology.

I can almost hear Jeff&#x27;s voice...<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t make your problem the customer&#x27;s problem!&quot;<p>There are often many technical solutions to create a particular customer experience.  Jeff never accepts false dichotomies.  If the particular technical solution being considered fails to produce a delightful customer experience then you better start thinking about other solutions.  Many of the projects on which I worked turned out much better when Jeff challenged us break out of our little technical boxes and consider alternate solutions that preserved the customer experience.<p>I can sense that my answer will be frustrating to some who don&#x27;t like being told that they aren&#x27;t thinking big enough / creatively enough / bold enough / outside the box enough.  Believe me, I felt that way too when working on Jeff projects.  I left his office in frustration many times only to realize several hours or days later that I would have been better served by focusing on creative problem solving instead of trying to convince Jeff that X was not possible.<p>I have immense respect for Jeff.

8240811,comment,8237952,8237952,0,0,rrggrr,,,"IFTT and Zapier are two of the most exciting companies to watch in tech right now.  Why?  Because automation and programming are still inaccessible to most people, but the need and interest is widespread.  IFTT and Zapier, both of which I use, are racing for breadth of services they integrate as opposed to depth of a service&#x27;s API they expose/support.  I think that is a mistake.  I also believe the first of the two to support industrial devices, a robust security model and open source hardware will run dominate the space.  There are only so many Mailchimp, Salesforce, Google Docs integrations of value - but infinite use cases for device integration.  On this score perhaps IFTT has a lead.  IFTT and Zapier are what, IMHO, Apple&#x27;s Automator should have been.  I think Apple may have missed the mark throwing resources at Swift, when the much larger market is end-user integrations.  I might add applications like Tasker and Locale on Android add a ton of value to those platforms, at the expense of the iPhone, and Apple remains largely absent on the integration front.",1409277441

Practice in Wiccan grounding, centering and shielding helps (Google that or start with <a href=""http://www.witchvox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.witchvox.com</a> and start probing, I guess; I don&#x27;t know of any instruction materials currently in print or online). This is my experience, so I describe it here in first-person...<p>When I close my eyes, almost immediately my visual memory lights up with a &quot;day review&quot; which is like a daydream but for being something which I can direct, using pretty much the same visualization mechanism I use for data/code/schematic structures when I&#x27;m designing, coding or debugging. I can feel that forebrain activity as a slight heat just behind my forehead. It&#x27;s great for overview and casual entertainment when I can afford the time, but not when I need a quick nap and it&#x27;s keeping me conscious.<p>I will the main weight of my awareness to recede from that frontal visualization viewplane, moving toward the back of my skull, deliberately dissociating from the visual activity, to where things feel like they&#x27;re quieter and move slower. If, for motorcycling, where a less tightly-focused, more panoramic viewpoint is best for situational awareness, I take a half-step back, for quick napping I take several steps back.<p>You can forcefully imagine the footsteps if it helps establish the change of center; after awhile, that mental positioning becomes familiar enough to dispense with the imagined physical/aural sound-effects.<p>Sorry if it sounds all too Crafty or New-Age, but that&#x27;s how I live.",1409277409

Second, add more features on top of what we have.<p>As much as I hate C++, we do live in a C dominated world, and C is… limited.  The lack of a usable generics system is crippling.  C++&#x27;s destructors <i>really</i> help with semi-automatic clean up.  And it would be good to have a module system, and maybe built-in support for algebraic data types.

8240784,comment,8239129,8240701,1,0,pron,,,"> Do you agree then that all those non-technological assumptions can be included in one&#x27;s utility calculations...<p>Perhaps in theory. In practice I don&#x27;t see this happening without turning into a religion. Even from the rational perspective, you don&#x27;t really have enough knowledge to make a reasonably informed bet. From a rational perspective it&#x27;s just buying a lottery ticket. But that&#x27;s not the psychology of what&#x27;s happening here. To me, your question sounds like: &quot;so you don&#x27;t agree that people would choose who they sleep with based on cold utilitarian estimates?&quot; Well, maybe that&#x27;s theoretically possible, and maybe <i>some</i> people can do that, but that doesn&#x27;t happen in the general case, because human psychology is also very real.<p>I do not for one second believe that people can think about death and about options of spending resources to win an afterlife in a purely rational, utilitarian way. If you&#x27;re saying that&#x27;s how you think then either you&#x27;re suffering from a mental disorder (I&#x27;m saying it in good humor) or you&#x27;re not being honest with yourself. I don&#x27;t think that cold calculation can trump fantasies of eternal life in a bright future. I think that there&#x27;s no way such fantasies do not cloud your judgement, just as a pretty girl would make you do dumb stuff. That&#x27;s just how we&#x27;re wired. Once hope and emotion play a role in guiding your decision to <i>act today</i> based on the belief in a (positive) afterlife, you stop being a scientist and turn into a believer. But that&#x27;s OK. Most of us, including scientists, are often religious (even if we don&#x27;t ascribe to the omniscient-omnipotent-deity religious model). But we should realize that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing, and know when we&#x27;ve moved from the very earthly, Sisyphean, frustrating, limited, no-promises science to religion, where anything&#x27;s possible.<p>(Actually, who says we should?)",1409276541

8240698,comment,8238869,8240640,3,0,saidajigumi,,,"As we learn more, I agree that higher level approaches will certainly find application.  But to the idea of creating industrially useful quantities of spider silk, what&#x27;s really going on is engineering an entire production workflow.  For example, we&#x27;ve heavily selectively bred Bombyx silkworms, to the point that they are true domesticates: they cannot survive (or even <i>eat</i>) without direct human maintenance.  (Note: there are many varieties of wild silkworms as well, many tended for fiber use.)  This is incredibly labor intensive, and the fact that we continue to do this speaks to the high value placed on silk.  We could engineer another domesticate biofactory as a spider, but that seems likely to also be incredibly labor intensive.  But who knows, maybe an arachnid equivalent of <i>Bombyx mori</i> could spawn an entire spider silk industry?<p>Still, the desire to use bacteria as protein factories holds obvious allure for industrial scaling.  Of course, that means we need to engineer not just protein secretion but the entire process from gland to spinneret.",1409274665

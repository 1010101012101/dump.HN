2212271,comment,2211608,2211608,0,0,vanessafox,,,"To answer a few of the questions asked in the comments:<p>My interpretation of what the combo algorithmic and manual efforts is this:<p>-One of Google's paid link algorithms (possibly a new one or possibly an existing one that was recently tweaked) flagged some of the links or one of the link networks. This caused those links to no longer count towards PageRank credit (and possibly causing some of the initial rankings drops, such as the ones from position 1 to position 7).<p>-When Google was alerted to the issue, they took a closer look and on manual inspection found not only additional problematic links but also other spammy issues (if you follow the link in my story to the blog post by the guy who helped NYT with the investigation, you'll see that the SEO firm set up doorway pages and that the jcp pages themselves have keyword stuffing and hidden links on them). Based on that manual review, Google added a manual penalty to the site.<p>That's why my conclusion is that once they fix the issue, the manual penalty will be removed and they'll rise a bit in ranking position. But since the algorithmic penalty simply (I'm speculating) caused some of the paid links to be devalued, there would be no ""lifting"" of this penalty.<p>It is very disheartening that something so vital to business success (understanding how to operate online; build a web site with good site architecture; engaging with searchers; solving their problems) is so much equated with these types of tactics.",1297580166

Joy's prowess as a computer programmer is legendary, with an oft-told anecdote that he wrote the vi editor in a weekend. Joy denies this assertion.[2] Joy's accomplishments have been sometimes exaggerated; Eric Schmidt, CEO of Novell at the time, inaccurately reported during an interview in PBS's documentary Nerds 2.0.1 that Joy had personally rewritten the BSD kernel in a weekend.""<p>""Joy was also a primary figure in the development of the SPARC microprocessors, the Java programming language, Jini / JavaSpaces and JXTA.""<p>""BBN had a big contract to implement TCP/IP, but their stuff didn't work, and Joy's grad student stuff worked.

Additionally, I would be highly surprised if any shred of the ground software that supports it is in Lisp.  Both flight and ground s/w is almost certainly in C/C++ and Java.<p>One of the successors to RAX is:<p><a href=""http://ase.jpl.nasa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ase.jpl.nasa.gov/</a><p>in which an Earth-orbiting spacecraft can recognize events like volcano eruptions) and autonomously (without ground control) take extra data from it.<p><i></i>*<p>It's hard to appreciate just how unwilling a flight mission is to take on any unnecessary technical risk.  Risk, along with cost, schedule, and mass, is one of the fundamental things mission designers must cope with.  Lisp looks like risk, and risk will be eliminated ruthlessly (as in the meeting Erann describes in the OP).<p>Additionally, there are the software lifecycle considerations.  That is, flight s/w, if it works, tends to be passed forward from mission to mission, and quirky choices tend to be weeded out.",1297580048

If so, find a partner in China to handle sales there.<p>I would expect most any Chinese customer to want to have your solution hosted in China..either by themselves or at least through a China based server.

This is a good reason to find a China partner that manages this process for you.<p>B2B software sales in China is an ""ok"" market.  Chinese companies do spend money on specialty software and there is usually a purchasing officer at a company that makes money off the process of spending money.

The fact that your product is well-known in your niche means that you've got a slightly easier job at marketing a similar project.<p>Other options you could consider: \nA) How technical is the support you get caught doing? Is it something only you can do? Would hiring a technical support ""employee"" via oDesk or Elance make sense? Would an open forum for support (if it doesn't already exist) help users solve simpler problems? Can you reasonably charge a support / maintenance fee (Charging for exceeding X hours of support per month)?\nB) Are there other ways to encourage the time commitment and get churches to keep using?

This ""worked"" for the Xbox, but if Microsoft were any other company it would have gone under using that strategy.  Microsoft hasn't <i>bought</i> Nokia, either, it's just a partner; so how much of the throwaway cash will come from Nokia, and how much from Microsoft?",1297577026

He promptly ordered all doctors executed.<p>I'd say that bad schools get more money because they need it. In a school that's practically a war-zone, you need lots of money just to replace the essentials that students wreck.<p>Bad schools often have good inputs (students per teacher, facilities, etc), but they also have things like ex-students lurking outside the school gate (dealing drugs? signing up gang recruits? heckling the students? who cares); and many of the parents don't exactly help the kids get their homework done.<p>There are programs (cash transfers to poor parents, if they meet certain conditions) that have been proven to work (through randomised trials - something that Mexican politicians are better at then US ones), but it's more expedient to look for ""root causes"" (play the blame game) than look for empirical solutions that work (even if you don't understand why).",1297576962

2212207,comment,2212141,2212141,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Without knowing more about what your company does it is hard to give an answer. In the state the question is in now you are asking if you should pitch company A or company B, but not telling us what either company does.<p>My second question is you say that your friend says that he told you ""investors would never give us money for the reasons I had outlined."" However, you never outlined any reasons why investors wouldn't give you money. All you have said is that you are happy about your company in the current state/direction and that raising money would fill in gaps.<p>You also say your friend suggested a ""slight pivot"", which to me implies a few minor tweaks to the business model, not an entirely new model. Further along you say that the pivot creates a whole new set of problems, which to me implies that these are more than minor tweaks to the business model. In my eyes, a slight pivot would be something along the lines of a different or expanded target market with the same product, but it sounds like your friend is suggesting a completely different product.<p>Finally, I don't know you or your friend, so please do not take this personally or the wrong way. Just because someone has raised money before does not make them an expert in funding or in what investors want. That's not to say, that the advice he gives shouldn't be considered with weight. But he may be relating your product to his investors and believe that his investors would not fund it. That is not to say that other investors may see the product in its current state as a win. For validation of this theory all you have to do is look at a VC like Bessemer. They even list their ""anti-portfolio"" on their website of companies that approached them and they turned down.<p>What is more valuable to an investor is if you have a MVP, traction, revenues, IP, etc... Personally, based on the info you have provided, I would pitch the current company as it is. You don't need money because you are ""inexperienced"". Reasons you need money could include, finishing development, sales, marketing, etc... Prior to pitching I would outline how much money I am looking for and how I would spend it. The investors are going to want to know what their dollars are going to and for so you might as well have that info ready. Pitching your idea in its current state at an event like this can be an invaluable experience. You may find that your friend's advice was right on and begin making the adjustments. Just because you pitch isn't a guarantee you are going to raise money either way, so use the event as a chance to gain experience pitching. You are not going to burn any bridges with a bad pitch, and either way you will walk away with connections. You can use those connections later to reach out for further meetings. Investors like to see resilience and determination in entrepreneurs, and by taking their advice from the pitch event and applying it to your business model, it will only make you stronger and more valuable to them in the end.",1297576830

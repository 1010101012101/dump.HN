I'm wondering if two monitors better than one and if a 30"" is worth the expense. Thoughts? ...""</i><p>I've just upgraded my old sony trinitron 17"" to <i>""a""</i> new 22"" Asus & have thought about some of the q's you have asked. Some things I'd suggest are:<p>- if you use double monitors try to make the the same size, ratio<p>- check the hardware will realistically support 2xmonitors at max rez<p>- check if graphics card has 2 vga ports (eg: NVidia)<p>- check OS supports max rez<p>- look for tip/tilt egonomics<p>- check text rez for reading<p>- check if you are getting right monitor for use editing +  (heavy dvd usage?, gaming?, colour correctness for graphics?)<p>- power consumption. some of the new LCD's are guzzlers<p>2 x monitors is good for individual apps on 1 screen (1 for code, 1 for browser etc) but I find virtual desktops (Virtual Pages) are just as handy. I'd advise against mixing monitors. I've tried it but the different sizes make it hard (but not impossible) to use.",1204096179

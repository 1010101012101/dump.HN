5722466,comment,5721964,5721964,14,0,HorizonXP,,,"Having done quite a bit of Android development in the past few months, and for the foreseeable future, I'd have to say that people really are missing the point of OS releases.<p>The way Google is currently updating their core apps is the right way to do it, and should have been done from the beginning. Honestly, it seems counter-intuitive that it isn't that way on iOS. I realize why, Apple does stuff that requires tight OS-level integration that they don't expose to others. But the fact that Google and BlackBerry do this means to me that Apple made an architectural choice that will ultimately slow their speed of deployment of key updates. BlackBerry and Google can update their maps apps whenever they want, and regularly do. Apple had to wait for an OS release.<p>With all that said, I am tremendously disappointed that we didn't see another Android point release. I understand why to an extent, but there are glaring omissions in the OS that make it exceedingly difficult to build an app that has significant features that interface with hardware and peripherals. The Camera API is lackluster, and the Bluetooth support (Or lack thereof ) is just shameful.<p>The only saving grace of Android is that you can fix these problems yourself, if you know what you're doing. But it isn't easy, and is beyond they capabilities of most devs.<p>Here's hoping Apple announces something awesome at WWDC. I still love Android for what it is, but they do need to catch up in a few key areas.",1368759283

It doesn't have a complex query engine, so you end up having to do massive scans (which aren't especially fast), transfer a ton of data to the node where your analytics code is running, and do the computation there. If things are too big to run on one machine, that's your problem, not HBase's.<p>On the other hand, Impala, RedShift, Oracle Exadata, etc. let you ask the database to do work at a much higher level, which allows for much better performance because the data storage and computation layers can work in tandem (so you can prune down to only the data your query needs at each storage node before hitting the network, for example), and the database does the work of optimizing for multiple cores and nodes, not the writer of the analysis routine.",1368759041

They're all little joke currencies that don't affect anything.  ""Aww, that's cute.  Your town trades tickets redeemable for an hour of work.""<p>If any of them were adopted by a nontrivial number of people or if people started using bitcoins or euros or yen in significant quantities the government would definitely get involved in a very hostile fashion.<p>>Well let's put it this way: what currency can you use to pay your taxes? Now, if you are a business that actually pays its taxes (as most do), what currency will you need to do business in?<p>Doesn't matter.  If people don't actually hold dollars and just change their bitcoins into dollars when they need to pay taxes the government doesn't gain anything by printing dollars.  It just means every year when I go to pay my taxes I get many more dollars for my bitcoins than I did the previous year.<p>>USD is backed by the law: tax laws, debt laws, torts, fines, fees, etc.<p>Right.  Nothing, in other words.  The same was true for the Zimbabwe dollar until they gave up.  It just means people will convert whatever they're holding into dollars when they need to deal with the government.<p>>First of all, there is basically no chance of Bitcoin supplanting the US dollar, for the reasons outlined above.<p>You haven't made your case for that at all.  If the CPI goes back to what it was, say, in the Carter years (and it will), Bitcoins could supplant the dollar very quickly.<p>The biggest obstacle to adoption is the fact that you can't hold a bitcoin in your hand.  But if that mental block was overcome people could switch over very quickly.  Personally, I doubt it will happen because people will be reluctant to trust a virtual currency, and a few rumors about a mathematical flaw in the algorithm is all it would take to shatter any built up trust.  But it's not impossible.<p>>That being said, even if by some miracle Bitcoin supplanted the dollar, the government would not go bankrupt, it would just start using Bitcoin. The switch from the gold standard did not bankrupt the government; why would a switch from fiat currency to Bitcoin bankrupt the government?<p>The switch <i>from</i> the gold standard didn't bankrupt the government, but a switch <i>to</i> the gold standard certainly would.  You realize, do you not, that QE is nothing more than a sophisticated way to print money?  The government could not pay the interest on the debt without the fed creating money and using bond purchases to drive down treasury rates.<p>>Despite the ramblings of certain libertarians and anarchists, this is not Zimbabwe, we are not bankrupt, and we are not expanding the money supply to avoid bankruptcy.<p>This is just wrong (except the part about us not being Zimbabwe).  That's exactly what we're doing.  The only reason we're getting away with it is the monetary contraction that occurred when the housing bubble collapsed.  But that contraction is pretty much over.  Balancing the budget without printing money at this point would require politically impossible decisions.",1368757023

It's based on a very simple API: publish/subscribe.<p>Anything that has these methods can be easily binded to DOM and can easily interact with data structures like new-list and new-object.<p>Frameworks are monopolistic. They don't let you take advantage of the open source at all. You can't replace the a core mechanism or data structure of a framework but if you use something built from small independent modules, you'll be able to optimize more, create more, reuse more, extend more, fork more.<p>This simplicity, the two methods interface, lets you create your own data structures that can be binded to new-reactive. Since your all dependency is publish/subscribe methods, you can easily replace each part of your code if you need to move on to another direction. But frameworks will force you to use or depend on only their own abstractions. That can be very expensive and dangerous your monopolistic framework gets out of fashion or starts implementing ideas that suck.",1368756171

5722322,comment,5721311,5722253,3,0,Cogito,,,"> I think you misunderstand sunk cost. Sunk cost basically just says to always employ a purely-forward-looking strategy when evaluating costs and benefits<p>I don't think I misunderstand sunk cost, but perhaps I didn't explain my point well enough.<p>I agree that you need to be forward looking, but whilst looking forward it can be important to consider existing investment. Existing investment is not <i>ALWAYS</i> worth nothing, so its value needs to be accounted for. Existing investment is also a metric that, whilst lending itself to entwining one in the Sunk Cost Fallacy, is an important part of answering the question ""how much <i>more</i> investment is needed?""<p>The sunk cost fallacy applies in a situation where previous investment has been lost. The typical example is in gambling, where each spin of the wheel is  independent of how much you have already lost on the table. When in a startup, however, previous investment is not <i>necessarily</i> lost, so switching to a new one is (typically) not the same as continuing one you have already invested in.<p>>> vs how much some other endeavour will take to become profitable AND how much it will cost to switch.<p>> Wait, what are these two costs? Aren't they the same? Where did the cost of switching come from?<p>The cost of switching is a way of characterising things like lost earnings and payouts that are not directly related to starting a new endeavour. They are typically, though not always, constant regardless of the new endeavour being considered, and so it makes sense to keep them separate.<p>Examples of switching costs:<p>* paying out a phone contract;<p>* loss of long service benefits (if someone is close to receiving long service benefits they will typically wait to receive them before switching jobs);<p>* non-compete clauses.",1368756019

For example, you can do a study on the top reasons teens use drugs, and in a decade those reasons have completely changed because of the shift in culture.<p>The social sciences don't work well with the scientific method.

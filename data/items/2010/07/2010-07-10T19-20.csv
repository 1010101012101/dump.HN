In light of these statistics, the authors of this study question why alcohol and tobacco are legal to use within current drug policies for Britain and the United States, while less harmful drugs like ecstasy and LSD are deemed illegal to use.""<p>Ok, so if you start with a statistic representing the frequency of an event in the general population caused by a drug that is legal and in widespread use, you cannot simply compare that directly to a lack of the same event attributed to another drug whose usage population is far lower. Far fewer people use ecstasy (just an example) than use alcohol or tobacco. That, in itself, doesn't make it less dangerous. You'd have to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the population that uses the drug, then apply a per capita calculation.<p>I'm not necessarily arguing that any of the drugs on the list shouldn't be there, but as soon as I saw bullet #3 (The drug's overall impact on society) I knew things were going to get fuzzy.",1278790601
1504213,comment,1503856,1503856,0,0,andreyf,,,"This rings true: no girl I've dated would have given my profile on a dating site a second look. You can't communicate over a profile what you can collaborating on a project, tutoring someone, or even playing WoW. Conversely, I don't like girls for what they would put in an online profile, but for the way the act in person.<p>So the elephant in the room, I think, is that dating isn't really a problem that needs solving via a web app. You can meet significant others in bars, art and yoga classes, the gym, book clubs or Bible groups, summer or weekend classes at a local college, study groups or tutoring, AA seminars, group therapy or AA seminars, in galleries, concerts, parks, parades, political action groups, conferences about hypnosis, or video games, or comics, or programming languages, or role playing, and on, and on, and on. Dating your coworkers might be risqué (although it hardly stops people), but dating your coworker's friends is quite all right. And guess what: your coworker's friends have friends, too. As long as you do things which involve meeting new people, you'll probably run into people you like enough to date.<p>Hell, I know a lot more couples who met playing WoW than I do who met using dating websites. What's the point of isolating and controlling the meeting of mates, when it's such a natural byproduct of being social? Yes, for most people, I think WoW counts as being a social activity.",1278790568

Since I had never done anything like that before I decided to just start buying stuff and testing it.

1504190,comment,1503894,1503894,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Programming meetups don't look like writing workshops because software is different from prose.<p>One big difference is the goal. The goal of a writing workshop is to make more readable stories. Readability is the metric, the only one that matters. When someone reads your story, they are performing a usability test. And when they tell you how to make the story more entertaining from the perspective of a writing-workshop writer, they are -- to first order -- also telling you how to make the story work better for the average reader, and how to make it sell better, and how to write a story that will attract publishers and agents to your work.<p>(Of course, to second order, workshoppers tend to produce the kind of writing that fellow workshoppers like. This can be a problem. There are people who are known as ""writers' writers"" -- those whose work is beloved by their fellow writers but which fails to catch on as strongly with the general public.)<p>A related difference is that story-writing is a smaller and better-defined problem than programming. There is one set of tools: The English language. There is one audience: Literate readers of English. There is a long tradition. There are well-established tropes. The marketplace is pretty well understood. (And the writers who aren't aiming to sell into traditional writing markets -- like, say, prolific bloggers -- don't tend to hold traditional writing workshops either. I've never heard of a blogging workshop. What sense would that make? Blogging <i>is</i> a giant global workshop.)<p>Finally, writers -- even fairly talented ones -- are a dime a dozen. The supply of people who want to write, and attend workshops, is vastly larger than the demand for written stuff.<p>Software is different. For one thing, it is far more diverse. A workshop in which Lisp programmers read strangers' corporate Java code, or expert Javascript programmers critiqued Linux disk drivers, would be kind of awkward -- fun and enlightening, perhaps; an entertaining circus of flamage, quite likely; but probably a bit superficial. To get a writing-workshop experience in software, you need to get everyone working on the same codebase. Open source is key here. Go to a Drupal code sprint, or a Rails hackathon.<p>Also: Software isn't designed to be read. Even those of us who would like to <i>believe</i> that software is designed to be read... don't design software to be read. Not primarily. The primary goal is that the stuff works, and/or that people buy it or use it. And the net result is that meetups tend to focus on ""virality"". Is the software nifty? Does it solve a problem? Is it usable? What's its cost/benefit ratio? Sad but true: These things are the metrics. They are, to first order, more important than the quality of the source code. [1] That's why programmer meetings gravitate towards these fundamental topics.<p>Finally, good programmers are hard to find, so it's hard to get three of them together in a room without someone trying to post a job ad on the wall. Writers <i>wish they had this problem</i>. If the writing-workshop folks heard you <i>complaining</i> that, gosh, you just can't hold a programmers' gathering without people trying to hire everyone in the room, they would burn you in effigy.<p>----<p>SUMMARY: ""To get a writing-workshop experience in software, you need to get everyone working on the same codebase. Open source is key here. Go to a Drupal code sprint, or a Rails hackathon.""<p>---<p>[1] Of course, code quality does matter.

It's extremely surprising that people actually buy cheese in the US, and they seem to have it with everything as well :/<p>To anyone who has tasted real cheese, it's just bizarre.<p>The other oddity is chocolate. In the US it seems to come universally without any milk or sugar added. Hersheys is bitter. Even the ""Cadburys"" (made under license) is quite hard to eat, and not anything like real chocolate.<p>And agreed. HFCS tastes pretty gross compared to the same drink with real sugar.",1278789689

They close the loop for you and you position your motor based on a pulse train which can be generated by a variety of devices.  The step-direction control of the servo does tend to generate more vibration than other kinds of inputs, but is very easy to interface with.<p>There are others vendors as well, just search for hobby cnc and servo and examples will pop up.  Advanced Motion Control also offers servo amplifiers which take other forms of input than step and direction which might be quieter.<p>As mentioned before, gear boxes are a big producer of noise as are powertrains in general.  Toothed Belt drives, especially at low speeds or capstan drives for finite rotation machines can be very quiet.<p>To figure out your motor sizing you need to estimate the speeds and forces / torques on your system.  From there you can estimate the power your system needs to produce and then  calculate a gear-ratio based on the available motor torques and powers available from off the shelf devices.  Maxon's catalog has design rules, equations and worked examples if you want samples of the math.<p>For what it is worth, I would guess that the Kelling 350W motors would be able to move a 2KG mass with what looks to be high accelerations and speeds with a decently designed drivetrain.",1278789520

What does this tell us in the hacker community especially as the web space in the West is becoming really saturated. Simple, just make your startup to be Africa friendly, if you can't make it your main strategy and you stand a better chance of not entering Techcrunch's deadpool.<p>So what are the advantages of doing this:<p>1. You will own the largest market share by the time the established web companies choose to come into that market. Eg Baidu controls 70% of the search market in China. Google and others share 30%. Facebook had to play catch up to Studivz in Germany and ofcourse sued them, <a href=""http://tcrn.ch/cfpc9Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tcrn.ch/cfpc9Y</a>.<p>2. Based on the above, when the big boys like paypal etc are ready to enter the market, they will be forced to partner with you or buy you outrightly. see <a href=""http://bit.ly/cESeqo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/cESeqo</a>.<p>3. The IPO's that have been so elusive in the US and europe are more easily attainable over there. After your IPO, you can come back and buy the biased established but struggling web based companies in the West. Remember how Asian companies were cherry picking US companies during the global crises, that will be your game.<p>So make sure you have a strategy for Africa and other emerging economies as you build your web app. Good luck.",1278789349

To clarify again:<p>- My statement is that Google was a rapidly growing search engine because they made the right UI decisions<p>- Your statement seems to be that without adwords, Google would have stopped growing and ultimately failed<p>Am I understanding your argument wrongly?

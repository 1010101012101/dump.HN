965622,comment,965492,965492,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"One point which I rarely see addressed in various internet fora is the striking similarity of <i>form</i> between orthodox Marxism and orthodox Objectivism. I realize this may be a repugnant idea to fans of either philosophy, but consider the following nutshell summary:<p>There are two classes of people in society. One class, which we call the ____, is productive and labors to bring forth all manner of useful things. The other class, which we call the ____, is not productive and, in fact, consists entirely of parasites who suck the life's blood out of their fellow men. These parasites accomplish their goal via exploitation and alienation: unjustly separating others from the fruits of their labor, though they wrap themselves in a philosophy by which they seek to justify their theft. One day, the revolution will come and the productive class will rise up and throw off the yoke of the parasites.<p>Broadly speaking, one can insert ""poor"" into the first blank and ""rich"" into the second and obtain the works of Marx.

Two things are going on here:<p>1) The United States, because of its historical pattern of settlement by recent immigrants from a variety of countries, really is easier to blend into for a new immigrant than are many other countries that also have friendly natives, developed economies, and reasonably transparent governance.<p>2) REVERSE culture shock is usually rougher on a returning expatriate than the original culture shock of leaving the native country. I say this as an American who studied Chinese as an undergraduate, lived abroad in Taiwan (with visits to Hong Kong and China) in the 1980s for three years, and then returned to the United States. Then I went over to Taiwan once more for another three-year stay beginning in 1998. It has always been more unsettling to my established assumptions to return to my ""home"" country after a stay abroad than to go abroad in the first place. When a person goes abroad, sure there are problems with culture shock, wherever you go, but the psychological inner dialog takes the form of ""Of course this is weird; I'm in a foreign country."" But upon returning ""home,"" after a long and locally connected stay abroad, the inner dialog becomes ""Hey, I thought I was coming back home, but now everything feels weird here too."" People aren't always sure where ""home"" is if they have sunk down enough roots in the foreign culture. As G. K. Chesterton wrote, ""The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land; it is at last to set foot on one's own country as a foreign land."" A long enough foreign stay will do that to one's mind.",1259446581

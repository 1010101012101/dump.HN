10162677,comment,10160916,10162630,0,0,runchal,,,"The story is a reported memoir that touches on a number of topics. The first, primarily, is about the treatment facility that takes care of people like her brother. Another is the negative and traumatic effects that addicts have around the people like them. In no way is this article about the brother but rather the effects of the brother to the world around him.<p>Often times, family members rely on arguments about the proper ways to behave to each other in order to silence or police objections to family behavior. In the case of addiction, it is complicated because addiction is itself complicated in ways that other forms of trauma are perhaps not. That said, is the voice of people who were traumatized by others worth less? Should it be kept quiet simply because the other person is a member of the family? Are we not allowed to acknowledge and discuss that addicts cause trauma for people around them that is deeply hurtful and is allowed to be heard as well?",1441238289

It&#x27;s enjoyable for me to fantasize about what I would do if I suddenly never had to worry about money again. I think about quitting my job, going back to school and learning about something I care more about (I didn&#x27;t care for my major) and doing some travelling. I only buy one ticket every month or so. This $1-$2 actually gives me mental enjoyment, more so than a candy bar at least.<p>However, last time I bought one the woman next to me bought $80 worth of mega millions tickets. To be blunt at the cost of sounding unkind, she looked like she was a lower class individual. I truly felt bad for her (for reasons I won&#x27;t elaborate on for conciseness) and I thought about all the people spending a decent sum of cash on something that is analogous to flushing money down the toilet.<p>I think the lottery does much more harm than good to society as a whole and should be done away with. The people who get into spending loads of money on these tickets are ones who are - generally speaking - uneducated and in a position where they don&#x27;t have much going for them. Instead of being proactive and trying to improve their lives (easier said than done though, i know), they get caught up in this dream that destiny will save them from a life of difficulty. Obviously those susceptible to addiction are most affected and taken advantage of here, as mentioned by some other comments. It&#x27;s not really a &quot;tax on the stupid&quot; because these people are more of a cost to society by wasting money and putting themselves in harder positions.<p>Not to mention the people who DO win the lottery don&#x27;t often find themselves living the peachy life they would expect.",1441237371

In a microservice world, I would (and have) split this like so:<p>* Front end: Perhaps a basic Node.js or Rails app. It&#x27;s UI only; all data handling is done through APIs to the backends.<p>* Admin: Completely separate app. Same here, UI only.<p>* Post backend. This is a data store for articles. It has APIs for creating, updating, deleting articles. It also has a permission system that connects users to the groups that they are part of. This could be a separate microservice, but it&#x27;s natural to keep it close to the data (also for performance reasons, since every post lookup needs to check if the calling user is allowed to see it).<p>* Login backend. This has a user database and can do things like accept logins via other services such as Google and Twitter, via OAuth.<p>* Miscellaneus support services. For example, say you want to support upload images: Make it a microservice that calls into ImageMagick and stores stuff in S3. Or let&#x27;s say you want to support importing WordPress exports (WXR archives). Make it a service that parses and uploads asynchronously to the post backend.<p>I have built this as a monolith, and as a microservice system. The microservice platform is much more flexible and clean.<p>It also allows us to reuse every part for other apps â€” and this is in my mind the number one benefit that microservices gives you. We&#x27;ve had several new projects completely unrelated to what we&#x27;ve built before, and we have simply reused the microservices we had already created, only swapping out the new front end.<p>Making reusable microservices is an interesting challenge, since core concepts (things like users and data objects) need to be generalized, and mechanisms built in so that you can make specific features that don&#x27;t burden the microservices with too many conflicting concerns. For example, let&#x27;s say that your CMS&#x27;s public site wants users to be able to &quot;like&quot; individual articles. Instead of building this into the article store, create a microservice which abstracts the concept of &quot;liking&quot;. Or let&#x27;s say you want users to sign up for a newsletter version of the site that sends them a digest every week; again, don&#x27;t build it in, but make a microservice that abstracts this into &quot;subscriptions&quot;, with a registry of emails and what users are subscribing to, and so on. To generate well-formatted emails, simply let the front end provide an API for rendering templates, which this &quot;subscription&quot; microservice can invoke to do the actual rendering. Generalizing it this way makes it easy to then create new types of subscriptions, such as SMS messaging.<p>Another important point is that every microservice has to be multitenant; a single microservice can host multiple unrelated datasets, and they need to be partitioned in a way that allows the APIs to not comingle the data by accident. It&#x27;s not rocket science, but it takes some planning and practice to make the APIs feel natural.",1441237290

I would love to see a macroeconomic model, which is not just an assumption of equilibrium subjected to external shocks. I have only seen such models from postkeynesians. (Austrians do not count - they pretty much throw hands to the air and say &quot;it does whatever it does, we cannot know anything, therefore it&#x27;s OK&quot;.)<p>> can you rephrase it in a way that has some meaning<p>Well, assuming you want to show that some self-organizing system should be a moral guide, for instance, claiming that free markets lead to &quot;efficient&quot; (whatever that means) outcomes, then necessarily this self-organizing system has to have a stable unique outcome (which pretty much rules out chaotic behaviour that dynamical systems love to exhibit). If it had two different outcomes, then it couldn&#x27;t be a unique source of morality (someone would have to come and decide which outcome is better).<p>For example, that&#x27;s why economists, who believe in free market, cling so much to idea that there cannot be endogenous unemployment (and instead explain it as some sort of reaction to external &quot;shock&quot; which will eventually pass). If existing unemployment was endogenous, it would mean that at some point in the past there was a choice (bifurcation), which would set us to path of either unemployment or full employment, and the self-organizing system of free market &quot;made&quot; the morally wrong choice, or at least it was indifferent (meaning it is not a good moral guide).",1441236949

In the case of jacket and pants, I prefer my synthetics as their better in all weather.<p>And then there&#x27;s goose/duck down. With that, it&#x27;s more a case of synthetic being an adequate substitute, but an inferior one. If you&#x27;re tight on space, down sleeping bags and jackets have superior insulation for their smooshed-down size. I&#x27;ve got a Patagonia down vest (cruelty-free! I&#x27;m off the hook, right?) that&#x27;s loads warmer than any of the synthetic vests I&#x27;ve spent a fair bit of money on, and it packs to just a little rolled up ball.<p>But clubbing baby harp seals in the head?

You don&#x27;t just sit down all day and write code, you have to write documentation, you have to do research to find ways around bugs, you have to design the UI and data structures.<p>For example I would write Pseudo code on paper to work out design flaws before I entered it into the computer. I would write Flow Charts and other things. I even developed my own method of developing data structures and database tables on paper as well.<p>When I got stuck I&#x27;d research things in a book, or I&#x27;d search for the answer on the Internet. Companies paid for a MSDN subscription and have to make it pay off by searching the knowledge base esp when dealing with API calls that change with each service pack. In using Visual BASIC 6.0 sometimes I&#x27;d have to ask a developer at Microsoft via MSDN when I found a bug in Windows or Visual BASIC itself that killed my project and find a way around it. Crystal Reports we used and talking to Seagate Software at the time was the only way to fix CR issues. We had an issue where if the user wasn&#x27;t an Admin on a Windows PC it would show duplicate rows, and Seagate got a service pack out to fix that issue.<p>Everything I did on the Internet, on the phone, or reading books was job related and going towards solving problems and using resources. But my managers didn&#x27;t always see that as work because they wanted me to solve the problems by myself, which would have taken a lot longer and impossible without a service pack to fix bugs.<p>I never read a book, used the Internet, or made phone calls for personal things, they were all work related.<p>Yet a service pack is like the size of a CD-ROM and takes five hours to download, so they noticed I was using 5 hours of Internet when that happened. (This was in the late 1990s when the Corporate Internet was slow).<p>Other programmers who didn&#x27;t do the same things I did to solve problems, could not solve them and the projects got reassigned to me to fix them, because I was able to fix problems.<p>No matter how good you are, you will get stuck on some problem and need someone else&#x27;s help to solve it. If it is a bug in the language or OS, you&#x27;ll need a service pack or a way to get around it.<p>You managers might not always understand that you need to seek help by reading a book, looking in a knowdlgebase, or talking to a developer on the phone to solve things.<p>Your programs work on the old OS with the old service pack, but as soon as new ones come out they break compatibility and trying to figure out what changed without contacting the company that made the updates is really really hard to do.",1441235184

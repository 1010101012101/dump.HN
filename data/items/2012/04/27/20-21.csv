Unless they drive down the price of copper.  However, flooding the market drives down prices so rather than saying they can provide X you need to look at how much they could sell 100 tons of platinum a year for.

Ryan Carson just told us last week that he works 32 hours a week, and his company impacts the world a whole lot more than Evernote IMO (subjective, yes, but Treehouse and Carsonified educate and connect people in a way they couldn't have done otherwise, whereas you can eliminate the need for Evernote by creating a folder or two on Dropbox).<p>7.

There have been two main changes in scoring: in 1995 they recentered the scores which in effect increased many peoples' score on the order of 50 points or so (one can convert old scores here: <a href=""http://2-bit.com/misc/satcalc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2-bit.com/misc/satcalc.html</a>).  In 2005, they added a writing section so now your score is out of 2400 instead of 1600.  Also, I think you'd want to compare peoples scores based on the current scale which would mean adjusting scores prior to 1995 so that they are recentered and either multiplying by 3/2 for scores before 2005 or discarding the writing portion for everyone.<p>But many people don't even take the SAT.  At least when I was in high school (and likely still today), midwest universities tended to prefer the ACT.  Thus, you're essentially looking for people who hit some percentile on national tests, similar to what one would do when applying for MENSA.<p>Also, as you and others have stated, this isn't really the best way to evaluate people for programming jobs.",1335558897

Learn bash better. Lots of low-hanging fruit there to increase your productivity with minimal effort.<p>2. Learn how to customize your environment in bash. Know what every line in your dotfiles does. Add to your dotfiles gradually as you learn.<p>3. If you learn about some cool features in zsh, see if bash has the feature already. If it doesn't, see if you can mimic it easily with your own functions or scripts.<p>4. If you still want more features, make the switch to zsh and repeat steps 1 and 2 with zsh.<p>I think the worst is when people see a novel trick and switch to zsh and slam in oh-my-zsh* without knowing any shell basics. Now you have another shell and a big pile of code and you don't understand any of it. This usually won't cause problems, but you almost certainly won't be getting the most out of your shell. You'd be better off in most cases just digging into bash a little deeper.<p>I use zsh now, but I only switched after learning what bash could do and what its limitations are. I'll reevaluate zsh vs. bash 4.0 at some point, but for now I see zsh installed by default more often than bash 4.0 and it seems to me that most users interested in the best interactive shell experience are still on zsh and I like to learn from them.<p>* - <i>I think oh-my-zsh is a great project - I'm not knocking it.

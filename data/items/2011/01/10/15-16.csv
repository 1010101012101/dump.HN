2088777,comment,2088152,2088426,0,0,Kadin,,,"I'm not entirely sure it was 'adaptation' that was the issue.<p>It wasn't that Facebook adapted and MySpace didn't; it was more that Facebook <i>started off</i> in a totally different direction from MySpace, and it turned out that the market preferred Facebook's way.  To focus on just a single difference that's probably the most obvious to casual users, Myspace allowed users a great deal of flexibility in designing their own pages (poorly), Facebook didn't and still doesn't, and basically presents a standardized page for each user with their information on it.  There's a significant 'philosophical difference' there.  Those differences extended beyond design to their user-acquisition strategy, which created the network effects that allowed Facebook to crush Myspace among college users.<p>Bluntly, the market decided it preferred a nicely manicured, access-controlled walled garden to the free-for-all of Myspace.<p>Interestingly, though, I think Facebook has now opened itself up to everyone to the point where it risks getting ""Myspaced"" itself; if influential users were to suddenly jump ship to something else, Facebook could become about as cool as having a Myspace page or Hotmail email address, and an exodus could follow.<p>Facebook built itself in large part on exclusivity but has attempted to move away from it in order to grow.  They're trying to walk a very delicate edge and I suspect that they'll fall off eventually.",1294675019

2088771,comment,2088330,2088330,0,0,NathanKP,,,"My first startup was a JavaScript wrapper for the Amazon product advertisement. My idea was that bloggers and others might appreciate a way to embed dynamic, location aware product ads. In other words they could just embed a script that looked like this:<p><pre><code>    <script src='http://affiliate-script.com/adBuilder.php?q=iPod></script>\n</code></pre>\nThe script used the IP address of the requesting visitor to determine which Amazon store to show products from. (US visitors saw products from the US Amazon store, Great Britain visitors saw products from the GB Amazon store.)<p>Additionally the ad builder always showed the most current and popular products, so the iPod query would always return the latest and greatest best selling Apple MP3 player.<p>The startup worked fairly well. It served more than ten million ad requests, and made about 500 dollars. I eventually abandoned it due to lack of interest. The only active users of the system were my own blogs and websites.<p>I recycled the code to form <a href=""http://bookflavor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bookflavor.com</a>, my new and current startup.",1294674842

The way I understand it is that in essence the no free lunch theorem only applies when candidate solutions are not re-evaluated in terms of relative performance. In coevolution we continually pit a population of candidate solutions 'to play' against each other in order to evolve a champion. Since fitness in this case is relative and not absolute - making performance tricky to measure - NFTL can be wiggled out of. as long as you can evaluate/term your problem within game like heuristics.<p>- <a href=""http://www.no-free-lunch.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.no-free-lunch.org/</a>\n- <a href=""http://cs.calstatela.edu/wiki/images/1/15/Wolpert-Coevolution.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.calstatela.edu/wiki/images/1/15/Wolpert-Coevolutio...</a>",1294674710

When Mark spoke at a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn't trying to start a company when he wrote the first version of Facebook. It was just a project. So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on it. He didn't think he was starting a company. If these guys had thought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted to do something more ""serious,"" and that would have been a mistake.""<p>I think Paul is suggestinging (at least emotionally) that you shoud follow your creativity and hope for a later opportunity of a great business.<p>In my opinion Paul is focusing on the kind of businesses which are mostly B2C, very innovative and very very risky.<p>My taste is somewhere in-between: my idea is that somewhow the joy of creativity should be combined with some seemingly boring old fashioned B2B market's need.",1294674673

Copying floppy disks was generally just as easy as anything else, and the skill level of the average computer user was much, much higher. Based on my experience I'd say piracy per capita was nearly 100% in the 80's. These days there are large swaths of computer users who simply don't install anything that isn't pushed at them, let alone browse through TPB. Before the Internet became popular in the mid 90's a large number of BBS's were dedicated to piracy.<p>Keep in mind ASP on software is a fraction of what it once was.

2088757,comment,2088330,2088330,0,0,flyosity,,,"I started a site called 9rules.com, along with a few other folks, around 2005. It was an aggregator of content from a curated list of blogs that people submitted to us a few times per year. Every 6 months or so we'd hold a ""membership round"" starting at midnight and literally thousands of blogs would submit their URL to us with the hopes of becoming a ""9rules Member"" and have their content syndicated on 9rules.com. We had a long list of criteria and painstakingly went through each blog to see if it met our standards of quality.<p>I wouldn't say it was a failure (it led to numerous other opportunities and friendships and we eventually had a small exit) but it was certainly not the success that we had all envisioned.<p>You can visit <a href=""http://9rules.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://9rules.com</a> now and see how the site is set up. It's been the same since before the acquisition.<p>Here are some facts about 9rules:<p>- 90% of our site visitors were newcomers. The vast majority of those were coming from Google. At one point we had a 9 PageRank (then it dropped due to stupidity on our part) so we were ahead of all the blogs we syndicated on Google.<p>- We were great at driving traffic from 9rules.com to our members. Not Digg-like (the measuring stick of the time) but more sustained traffic. And a ton of these visitors subscribed to the member's RSS feed.<p>What were the problems?<p>- The typical website visitor accessed 9rules, found a blog (or a few blogs) that they liked, visited that site, subscribed to their RSS, and then never came back to 9rules. Traffic never took off because it was continuously leaving and turning over. I guess we were too good at highlighting our members, but hey, that was the point of the site as we envisioned it.<p>- We had a pretty well-known brand, but had far less traffic than people thought we had. I sold ads for us for awhile and we couldn't do CPM-based pricing because our traffic was just too low for it to be effective. We had to hand-pick our advertisers and do special adver-torial advertising campaigns each time that were more of a brand buy than a traffic buy. Custom design and lots of work for each one since they were all totally different with different executions. This never scaled.<p>- We were too ahead of the curve, or something. We had a ""lifestream"" feature before anyone else really had that (integrating 5+ social services into one page sorted by time). We also had a question & answer section where each one could be starred, upvoted, or downvoted, back in 2007 or so. These features were awesome to develop but they were too early in the lifecycle of social network adoption to really take off.<p>- Couldn't get traffic to stick to our site. I mentioned this before, but if you're trying to build up traffic you need people to STAY at your site and keep coming back. We developed new thing after new thing to keep them there but it really never kept the traffic like we had hoped.<p>Lessons learned:<p>- Building something cool that a lot of people love doesn't mean you'll get rich off it. We had 9rules members tattoo the 9rules leaf logo into their arm. People had parties in Malaysia when we had a new membership round. A wife of a member made us all 9rules leaf pillows (it's on my desk in front of me). People thought we were millionaires based on our brand presence but we weren't. Not even close.<p>- If you're not motivated by money when you first build your thing then it'll be hard as hell to make any money. We built 9rules because it was a cool idea we had. We envisioned this great site with all these great features. We didn't think too much about a business model beyond ads.<p>- The relationships we made while running 9rules are priceless. Almost every good thing that's happened to my career since 2005 I can attribute directly to 9rules or recognition that 9rules brought me.<p>- Selling ads to put food on your table fucking sucks when your traffic isn't booming. You have to be scrappy and determined, and if you're both those things, you're still behind the 8 ball because you can't get on the major ad networks unless you have 5M+ pageviews per month.",1294674525

The response from 'computer people' was generally fairly muted - they didn't see what spreadsheets did that they couldn't already do in BASIC. People with no experience of computers assumed that computers could do damned near anything, so they weren't impressed. The response from accountants was quite different.<p>There was one particular instance at a trade fair, when Dan noticed a smartly dressed older gentleman paying very close attention to his demonstration. At the end of the demo, he approached Dan with a cheque already in his hand. Dan noticed that the man's hands were shaking; Although at the time an Apple II was an expensive purchase, the gentleman looked like he could comfortably afford it.<p>Dan asked him if he was nervous. The gentleman responded with great excitement, explaining that what he had just seen would completely transform his job. He talked about his career as an accountant, how his work had been changed by the introduction of tabulation machines and electronic calculators; He explained how this new invention would free him from countless hours of tedious calculation, allowing him to effortlessly play with numbers.<p>To Bricklin, VisiCalc was a clever little piece of software that paid him a good wage. To the gentleman, it was a complete transformation of what he did all day, a liberating technology, even a new lease of life. VisiCalc restored his interest in his work and made him genuinely excited to get up in the morning.<p>If we see functional business apps as boring, it is only through our own lack of imagination. Few of us are likely to significantly change the computing industry, but each of us has the very real opportunity to transform another industry. As software developers, we are uniquely privileged in being able to turn some small part of someone's work into play. As Steve Blank so often points out, when we look beyond our own walls and see how we could help people do things, the possibilities are limitless.",1294673674

The idea behind the company was to create simple fun games. As we started coding, we quickly discovered that neither of us were artists. Since we were bootstrapping, we could only afford a finite amount artwork and the game we were designing would require a ton of art. So we built a simple animation builder that would greatly reduce the amount of work. Once we built this thing, we thought it would be a great idea to make the animation app a consumer product. The idea was to let you make animations of your friends using only a picture.<p>We programmed the app and kept on adding features. After a long year, we finally decided that it was time to release it into the wild. We submitted it to Apple and waited. While it was in review, we received a number of great reviews from cultofmac and others. Then Apple rejected it. It took us a week to find out why. We removed the offending content and re-submitted. It then took Apple 6 weeks to finally review it again. I think they finally got around to reviewing it because Gizmodo wrote an article about it. At this point our morale and wallets were empty.<p>When the app was finally approved, we set about marketing the app. With an advertising budget of zero, you have to be pretty creative getting your idea out. We created about 100 animations of prominent tech journalist and sent it to every known email address of theirs. The reception was dismal. We even received some take down notices (which we promptly abided by)<p>After a few more weeks of more failed marketing attempts, we decided to throw in the towel and get real jobs.

We were able to get ""angel"" funding to keep going for a couple of years but not the big VC money that was needed for this domain (medical devices, so no ""customers"" other than euthanized animals).<p>The founders were serial entrepreneurs with a good track record and a lot of clout. I would summarize the reasons for failure as the following:<p>1) Obsessive efforts on patents, sucking up valuable time of key people.\n2) Not enough nitty-gritty technical folks. Literally half of the staff were ""Vice presidents""-- if you can even imagine that.\n3) I remember reading Guy Kawasaki's 10-20-30 rule (<a href=""http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule.html</a>) and laughing at what were putting on-- more like ""200 slides - 8 hours - 10pt font"".\n4) We shoulda made a more convincing prototype. We could have done it if less time was spent on patents and bullshit.<p>The founders had been successful in a much smaller domain. They made a lot of money and, I think, wanted to raise the stakes. It was a reach and it didn't work. However, I don't think anyone has/had hard feelings. We tried, learned a lot, and got to do some interesting stuff.<p>I now work for a boring company to pay the bills and do moonlight freelance with a buddy. If we ever go down the start-up route, I doubt we would ever attempt getting VC funding. I prefer keeping things small, manageable and profitable-- even if the profit is small.",1294672576

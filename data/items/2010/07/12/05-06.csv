This encouraged me to find out how to build my own games. Thats when I learnt BASIC and then went on to C and I am fudging around with Scala, Ruby and Clojure now. I learnt about architecture and beauty from games. I learned about image sprites and how beautifully they were used in Prince of Persia (Jordan Mechner's original) to create stunning worlds.<p>My scores dropped as well. But I do not think that academic scores are a measure of a person's intelligence. They are a measure of a person's commitment on how doggedly he would pursue a goal. I would argue that letting children play games explore ways of cheating and bending the rules of the system helps them become far better individuals than what today's education system can probably bring out. I guess most adults have gone sour to a point where they are jealous of kids having fun. :-) I remember in my friends place where my friend and his father would have fights about who would play the next game on the computer. You parents have to try it out once. I am sure your will have a better bond with your kid.<p>So my advice to parents is to ignore this article and be happy that your kid is playing games. Just ensure that the grades do not drop that low that it endangers his/her career altogether. Otherwise it is fine he/she would grow out of it.

So instead of direct emailing them the pitch, you say ""hey our app solves this problem - here's a page explaining why.""<p>2) It's scalable, since you can just send other people to the same page without having to pitch them all the time.  You could even set up some adwords campaigns for the specific phrase ""XYZ app with ABC feature"" and see what happens.

I've had more than one occasion to see an event unfold firsthand, and later read about it in the media.<p>There is no unbiased news. You must read between the lines, corroborate and reconcile different accounts, and generally think in order to piece together a picture of an event, even with reputable sources, because even reputable sources are really just a big organization that sent a reporter somewhere.<p>In fact, the reality is even worse: many topics of news have no singular ""truth"" to them. As soon as a reporter ceases to be strictly recollective, news becomes an editorial affair -- and that's ok, so long as people recognize it as such. The problem is that few people are equipped to make that distinction.<p>Most people never learn to take a piece of writing and tear it apart critically. It's a skill that requires time and practice to acquire. Without it, people conflate the hard news and the subjective bits. Quality journalism <i>should</i> include a mix of hard news and analysis, but the news market today sells to the lowest common denominator, who generally want a simple narrative in 500 words or less.

I don't really expect this between manufacturers, but even within manufacturers there can be pretty significant differences between devices.<p>Also, because Android doesn't have a particularly strong stance on how UIs should work and should be laid out, there also hasn't been a very strong stance on how buttons on the phone should be laid out and what the device should look like.  For instance, the back button can change functionality quite a bit between apps.  Or also, the G1 has a camera button but the nexus one (foolishly) doesn't.

Compliance with the criminal statutes of every state in which a company does business generally has only an incidental effect on business, because as a practical matter state criminal statutes that directly burden interstate commerce are striken down for violating the dormant commerce clause.<p>Let me give you a concrete example. Say California makes it a crime to possess cheese produced outside California. That&#x27;s an impermissible burdening of interstate commerce--an economic regulation (import ban) disguised as a criminal law. However, if you&#x27;re a cheese producer from Wisconsin doing business in California, you still have to abide by California&#x27;s other criminal laws, even though its a burden on you to ensure compliance with both California and Wisconsin criminal statutes.<p>In other words, the purpose of the commerce power is to allow Congress to impose uniform economic regulation, to prevent states from putting up trade barriers, etc. The purpose is not to ease the &quot;burden&quot; of complying with the criminal statutes of 50 different states. The states are entitled to have their own criminal laws and enforce them against those who do business in their state, as long as those laws aren&#x27;t just a cover for prejudicing out of state businesses.<p>Again, I think it&#x27;s stupid. We should just abolish the states and turn them into administrative districts.

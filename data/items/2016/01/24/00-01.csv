In fact my GP comment pretty strongly implies my belief that some privilege does exist.<p>My argument is fairly constrained in scope and can logically be broken down like this: privilege can be used to describe a group but not applied to an individual. This should be axiomatic; incorrectly applying group properties to an individual is known as an ecological or division fallacy. Whenever you hear (or invoke) an admonition to &quot;check your privilige&quot;, consider whether this error is being made.<p>The thing is, people know this. I know they know this because any example of &quot;anti-privilige&quot; is summarily dismissed as a unique case representing the elastic nature of privilige.<p>The other thing that makes privilige hard to discuss is that when you question assumptions or ask for specifics, you are instantly dismissed as an enemy of the cause. Your reply here is a great example. Above you mention &quot;a million other things&quot; that have been &quot;insanely thoroughly documented&quot;, I said I&#x27;d like to see them to look at them critically, and that trigged Red Alert. At that point you lumped me in with climate change deniers and considered me irrational, because asking questions makes me the Enemy. This is a pattern that occurs frequently; the CoC discussion on php-internals took a similar path. It&#x27;s such a bizarre thing to me, because as engineers we all follow a rubric that&#x27;s roughly: 1. identify and describe the problem 2. consider solutions 3. implement the best solution. But in the social justice arena, trying to participate in #1 gets you cast out as oblivious, ignorant, irrational, or worse -- unless you belong to a certain in-group.<p>In the quest for inclusion, it seems like there&#x27;s a lot of exclusion happening.",1453596954

Headphone impedances are typically between 16 and 600 Ohms, and line impedance is typically in the 10&#x27;s of kOhm range. That&#x27;s one way to differentiate. There has to be an output signal (presumably audio) first, however. \nAnother way is to apply a very small DC current (that would certainly not damage headphones, so I would guess in the micro-ampere range) and check if there is continuity or measure the DC resistance of the load outright. For line inputs, as they&#x27;re usually AC-coupled, DC resistance would be infinite, and for (DC coupled) headphones it is very low.

The only exception would be if all possible subgroups agreed this, which seems impossible. Any group of people choosing to do this would, of course, be doomed. So let&#x27;s analyze what happens to the number of kids.<p>Since there is competition you&#x27;re even making it easier for other groups to have kids, and therefore more kids will come from them. So the result of having less kids results in more kids, especially in the subsequent generations. (assuming you&#x27;re unwilling to do what China does to limit kids)<p>So for any individual the choice is simple, but indirect. 2 options:<p>Either one doesn&#x27;t believe your argument about less kids is better. Obviously those will have kids.<p>Or one does believe your argument about having less kids, as less kids will minimize suffering. In this case, you should have kids.<p>So there is no moral argument either way. But of course we know reality : kids are a burden. People are refusing to have kids because it would (at the moment) affect them negatively. I have a large family, and so I can compare the situation of older people having (lots of) kids to the situation of older people who are alone. I don&#x27;t agree that for an individual not having kids is better, in fact it is far worse.<p>But a shortsighted view that for 10-20 years having kids will be a burden that prevents them from realizing their dreams is quite common. And I can certainly understand that argument even if I do disagree with it.<p>But &quot;the good of the human race&quot; is a horrible, misguided reason not to have kids. It is good for the human race to have a minimum number of kids (I&#x27;d guess about 2.1 on average).",1453595870

In CLion you can rename a class, and all of its usages, declarations, etc. will be renamed.<p>The most useful thing CLion can do is change the signature of a function, and its corresponding implementation and header declarations will be changed. So, you can rename a parameter and its declaration and implementation will be renamed for you, or you can delete a parameter, or change the type of a parameter, and CLion will change all its usages/definitions/declarations for you. All of this effects across all files in your project, so if you&#x27;re in a .cpp file and you change the function signature, its declaration in the corresponding .h file will change as well.<p>(I believe you can do all of this in Eclipse as well)<p>Sadly I have yet to see a vim/emacs configuration that gets anywhere near the level of Eclipse/CLion.",1453595088

What makes you think that running a WebSigned app in a browser is significantly more exploitable than a native app?<p>The way I see it, the worst thing that can be said about WebSign is that it breaks the chain of trust — i.e. that first download is implicitly trusted without any validation from a root certificate preloaded on the OS, whereas an app installed through a well designed package manager wouldn&#x27;t have that problem. However, downloading a regular old executable through HTTPS is no different, and I don&#x27;t see you calling that out in the same way.<p>Beyond that issue, I would argue that the browser sandbox offers a more sophisticated and well vetted layer of protection than you would see in just about any native app framework, which leaves XSS as the primary risk (and Cyph has never had a known XSS bug anyway).",1453595037

They were founded in the 20s, profitable well into the 90s, and had a niche and a format that was poorly understood by existing department stores. Their only real competition was K-Mart.<p>HBC bought them out in the early 80s and then started shovelling more acquisitions on top; Bonimart, Fields, Woodward&#x27;s. They had enough capital to start fixing things - in the mid to late 80s your parents probably remember &quot;Club Z&quot; and pushing aggressively against their remaining competition to make sure they had the lowest price in town.<p>In the late 90s, just as Walmart was starting to show up in Canada (by buying up the burned-out corpse of Woolworth&#x27;s) and threaten pretty much every brand under the HBC umbrella, HBC centralized decision making and planning in HBC&#x27;s Toronto offices and under HBC execs.<p>K-Mart basically collapsed at this time from the same pressure; HBC opened up the purse and bought a lot of old K-Mart locations, intending to convert them. Eatons also died, and their assets were acquired by Sears.<p>I worked at Zellers to put myself through school briefly during this general time period, and I remember hysteria and confusion in all ranks of retail and management staff. Communication with HBC was generally command-and-control with no mechanism to individually fix brand-wide or regional problems.<p>Actual Bay stores in the late 90s were also doing poorly, and it was likely that Zellers was seen as a losing anchor that needed to slash margins further to compete with Walmart.<p>I will miss the chain. I had never really gone in prior to working there, but after working there I had gained enough weird institutional memory to be able to quickly find whatever I was looking for even in Zellers I had never visited before.<p>It is now basically a race in Canada to see if HBC or Sears will pull out first. Neither one of them are doing particularly well.<p>Canada is, in general, not kind to its department stores. <a href=""http://ottawacitizen.com/business/local-business/canadas-big-box-graveyard-target-joins-illustrious-company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ottawacitizen.com/business/local-business/canadas-big...</a>",1453594036

Comments on Science is supposed to be about comments, not about papers themselves, but I guess the jury's still out on that one.
The best I can do, that still fits in the context of the site as it is now, is to have a link where you can list papers tagged with e.g. ""antimatter"", and order them by score.
I'll think about your idea and get back to you on that. I would love to have some help as I am a solo-coder-designer-administrator on the site and it's already proved to be a handful.<p>Thanks for the feedback! Much appreciated.<p>Edit: I forgot to add a link for a similar site to that you described, but for computer science: <a href=""http://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards.html</a> Admittedly, the voting is missing, and it's quite narrow in scope, but my guess is sites like that exist for most fields.

2615741,comment,2615167,2615172,1,0,6ren,,,"<i>The Rational Optimist</i> expounds this theme at length. A summary is:  produce narrowly, consume widely.<p>Surprisingly, it benefits everyone to produce what they are best at and trade for the rest, <i>even when you trade for something that you are better at producing (i.e you are even better at producing something else)</i>. Thus, people can optimize locally.<p><i>EDIT</i> uh, article is by the same guy. Great book though he gets a bit rabid at the end. There's an especially striking story of skill loss in Tasmanian native Australians, due to being cut off from the mainland and having too small a population for the requisite collection intelligence to maintain those skills (doesn't prove it of course). Just now, I'm reminded of what someone said of MS: because millions of people use it, it's worth it to work on little details - so you can have a menu specialist. IIRC, collective intelligence isn't so much about how many people put their intelligence into it, but how many people need it (i.e. the market). The collectivity comes in in that other people similarly specialize in something else.",1307094958

It might get less popular in the computing mainstream, if the new-fangled devices really take over (i.e. no more PC as a ""hub""), but that just means we're back to the ""workstation"" days, and the expert users will still use that (+ keyboard shortcuts etc.).<p>The infamous ""gorilla arm"" has been mentioned here already. For a 8+ hours computing device, a bit more has to change than just tablets and Windows 8. We'd need some kind of super-ergonomic version of the Tron CEO desk.<p>NB: For those professionals who aren't using their mouse due to super-keyboard-efficiency (or possible pseudo-efficiency), it might as well replace it for the few times they'll use it. Whether the occasional moment of direct manipulation is handled by a mouse, trackball, trackpad, IBM nipple or touchscreen isn't that important.",1307092812

2615659,comment,2615521,2615521,4,0,terhechte,,,"I find that Windows users are not really known for their progressiveness. Lets divide them into three groups:<p>Business users, who have no choice anyway since IT installs their machines. As businesses are actually the main force behind Microsofts keen upholding of legacy code, there is little reason for them to get excited about a new interface. So here we have a very low adoption rate.<p>Non-Computer users: The kind of people who almost accidentally bought their PC at Walmart, still run Windows XP (maybe even 98SE), and mostly use the system to print ugly birthday flyers or play Solitaire. They would probably enjoy Win8, but they wont ever notice it exists until they go and buy a new PC at Walmart. Here, we have another low adoption rate.<p>The enthusiast Computer user: These are people that grew up with Windows, know (and sometimes love) all of its kinks and quirks, and use it for a variety of tasks. Theyre its avid defenders in Engadget comment threads and tend to be a tad regressive, since Windows has always worked for them quite well and as they fear loosing the high investment in Windows knowledge that they accumulated over the years. The less regressive, the higher the chance that this particular person has already switched to Mac or Linux. The more regressive, the higher the chance that he/she would actually reject or even despise radical Windows interface changes as it deviates too much from her/his well known Windows. The adoption rate should be pretty solid, but this market segment is also heavily courted by the alternatives.<p>For Microsoft, and for two out of these three groups, backwards compatibility is of uttermost importance. And that's why most energetic Windows users will love the Windows 8 approach of having everything, and this is also why most of them won't understand the complaints of Gruber et al: Because they like the looks of modern ui like iPad (or Windows 8 for that matter), but they love their 25 years of cruft.",1307092609

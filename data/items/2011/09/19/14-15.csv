3013777,comment,3011427,3013733,2,0,sunir,,,"The motivation for you to patent is that someone else can file before you even if you invented it first. That's new in the United States and common in other jurisdictions.<p>You make money by licensing your inventions to companies that have means to create a product. You can use trade secrets and copyright to protect your invention. You don't need patents. However, in the defensive patent world, you should still get one in case they steal your idea.<p>What you'd be prevented from doing is creating an expansive definition of a market. That's not crazy talk. In the case of the Lodsys patents, Novell has filed that for prosecution history estoppel, which my reading of Groklaw might be because the original patents were filed with caveats they would only apply to a restricted market (probably set-top pay-per-view TV boxes).<p><a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20110708021518693"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20110708021518...</a><p>I think this constraint on patents should be explicit and part of the law. i.e. a Pharmaceutical patent should declare it is for the pharmaceutical industry; if material engineering could use the same organic compound, that is sufficiently novel and non-predatory of the original patent holder. However, it's unclear in the current law whether or not the new use could pass.",1316444383

3013680,comment,3012206,3013302,3,0,troutwine,,,"> I noted this elsewhere, but I believe it has to do with Netlfix relationships and negotiations with the content creators, and how it differs from the Qwikster model of buying discs. Qwikster requires zero relationships and negotiations with the content creators.<p>Query: why does a radically different content acquisition model necessitate or suggest a split of the company? Would it not be less troublesome to make a new internal division focused solely on the DVD side of the business?<p>> I can't really understand why people get so upset about these changes because I can't find the catalog size/ low cost anywhere else. If anyone knows of a better service/value, I would be interested.<p>That they are splitting the interface has killed my long-term interest in Netflix. I tend to search for films based on whim and have an active love of long-tail content. I tend to throw several films at a go into my queues, being little concerned about what arrives and when. Each new disk a surprise; I end up using the Instant Queue as a priority filter when searching for entertainment. After the split my use case will be destroyed--I'll be required to visit two websites, which I won't as I can't do so idly--and consuming films becomes a matter of searching my own desires and making, as it seems to me, an arbitrary choice between formats. I once did treat Netflix as a library which could be idly passed through, picking things here and there off the shelf. It's all about the movies for me; format is a tertiary concern. Once Quickster is live the library will be gone. It'll be two properties competing for my attention and making the choice of format a primary concern.<p>I want to watch movies, not decide how to do so. Netflix is a luxury good, not an essential service. It _has_ to be so trivial to use that one does so without a thought because any luxury good that starts to incur costs--beyond acquisition--becomes less so. Netflix has the size, but by splitting they've reduced their lead over their competitors and it is no longer possible to view them after the awful website redesign, the price increases, the non-apologies and the site split as casually luxurious as they once were.<p>I'm still with Netflix, but I'll jump ship as soon as a competitor gives me that effortless feeling again. Netflix used to have it, Amazon almost has it and any one of the content holders might grow a clue, start their own streaming service and have it overnight.",1316442868

There was a ""No Thanks"" link at the bottom. Of course most people clicked that.<p>We decided to give them a Like button option, too. We made the lightbox modal, and required that they either ""Like"" or fill-in their email address.<p>An email address would suppress the nag screen forever (cookie based version of 'forever', of course). A Like would suppress it for, I think, 1 week.<p>After a week, they'd have the same screen, but then a Tweet button.<p>We used the AddThis API, made it easy, we attached an OnSuccess callback to the LikeButton.<p>We ran 2 tests, twice. The first split the old version to the new version with the Share option. We found the Share option decreased subscribers, increased Likes, and decreased ""No Thanks"" clicks.<p>Then we ran a test between that Share version, and a version where we eliminated the ""No Thanks"" link. It increased both subscriptions AND like's significantly. Numbers are to this day somewhere like ~10% increase in subscriptions, and a substantial increase in likes. Sales were not immediately impacted -- and they're pretty confident in increased sales due to the increased value of their list and fan page.<p>We did end up doing one more tweak -- I suppose we added a door to the Share Wall. We added a 25 second SetTimeout that fades-in the ""No Thanks"" link.  If they're in the middle of typing their email address or signing-into facebook or whatever, the set-timeout just resets itself. We don't want to cannibalize that social activity if they're in the middle of it.

But german computer scientists/software engineers are mostly just pathetic. I'm working in Germany and it's unbelievable what kind of people do get a CS master here.<p>The only successful german software corporations are SAP (which are outstanding) and a bunch of digital audio companies. The fun part is that they are so successful at digital audio because it's mainly an engineering discipline and the software is just the smaller part of the effort.<p>I suspect it's all about the education. Where engineering study is really hard the CS curriculum is pathetic.

All the eBay copies died. The most popular digg/reddit copy has 2 comments on the front page. And well, that's all.

I really think you could get away with glorified stick figures and still make a great video.<p>The script and storyline is important. The big takeaway that I've gotten so far has been to make it ""story-based"". So instead of just a screencast saying ""Crowd2 helps you create a marketing campaign to advertise your products"", try, ""Kevin is looking for ways to tell people about his new CD release...""",1316441172

Sure you can make your UX completely intuitive and accessible to everyone from 5 year olds to grandmas and everyone in between, but not all of us are that capable.<p>I see this as like the ""guiding light"" on modern video games when you're confused on where to go or what to do next.<p>For extra hand-holding I would actually enhance the plugin to highlight the target element and have feedback when the pointer and target come together. Also if there's a specific action that's supposed to occur (click, hover, etc) that a guide shows up when the cursor reaches the target.",1316441153

3013555,comment,3013205,3013205,18,0,wheels,,,"This is all good advice.  But there are two even more important things that I'd add:<p> Specialize.  It's <i>way</i> easier for an in-demand specialist to find work and also it's much easier to answer <i>who</i> you'd like to work for once you've got a narrower focus.<p> If you're applying for a job that's posted internet, you're already behind the curve.  Build a network.  Make sure that you know other programmers and that they know you're looking for a job.  If you know specific companies you want to work for, make an effort to meet people at those companies.<p>The two points interact because if you specialize, you tend to get to know the other specialists in your field.  I've done a lot of audio software in C++ and did that in my last job.  Even before working there I knew a bunch of the other people that did C++ audio software and one of them did an intro for me that got me the job.  This wasn't even theoretical -- I actually had filled out the online job form a few weeks prior and gotten the, ""This position has already been filled."" mail.  When I used a personal intro instead I had an interview inside of a week and they wanted to know how quickly I could start.",1316440878

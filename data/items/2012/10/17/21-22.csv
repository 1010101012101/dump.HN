I wonder if it is still a problem where the index is used a lot anyway.  A fix in MongoDB would seem a lot better solution than having everyone implement their own hacky count-caching solution.<p>EDIT: Actually, looking at the bug reports, sounds like maybe lock contention on the index?<p>The master/slave replication problem seems bad but I think it can be worked around (for my particular project) with a flag on the user session ... if they've performed a write in the last 30 seconds, set slaveOkay = false.

4666594,comment,4659855,4663337,1,0,jrockway,,,"As the article implies, the law is ignored.<p>Where I worked, there was a massive pay disparity among non-immigrant workers.  People hired out of college would be making $45,000 a year, while people that had been at the company for a few years and hired away from a well-paying job would be making $150,000 a year.  (Raises were basically given via counter-offer matches, as far as I could tell.)  There's then plenty of leeway to pay your H1Bs $60,000 a year, which is a rather low programmer's salary, while still paying <i>some</i> Americans less.<p>I think the key loophole is that you have to pay a certain average amount based on region and job code, but that region includes the suburbs and rural areas and the job code includes all of ""senior architect"" and ""test engineer intern"".  So you can pay someone a ""suburbs"" salary instead of a city salary, and pay them a non-financial-services-firm salary even though they work for an investment bank, and then pay them like the lowest-level ""computer programmer"" American regardless of their job responsibilities.<p>Anyway, if my previous employer's goal was to attract the best talent by paying great salaries, they failed.  I still have nightmares about the time I had to explain to someone with ""10 years of experience"" what an array was.  (He wrote something like: if day == 0: return ""Monday"" elif day == 1: return ""Tuesday"".  But I digress.)",1350510843

It is not impossible however, for example, they can use a few workarounds, like making a lot of requests for a specific page of TPB and then monitor the call spikes in their system but that requires for the providers to be aware that at least one of their VMs are hosting TPB. TPB does not even have a tracker now, so no obscure network traffic that makes torrents easy to spot because there are no torrents involved at all.<p>As for the second point, yes, much like youtube's approach, they can give law enforcement agency access to all VMs but again, they must know what cloud provider is hosting the site at any given moment.",1350510507

That in itself violates the Single Responsibility Principle by attaching the persistance mechanism to the entity itself.<p>What if your entities were just objects that held data and did validation, but you let use case objects determine the behavior of your system beyond that? Data persistance at that point is literally persisting your entities to the DB.<p>Then you use the DB much more like you would a filesystem - to retrieve and save data. It doesn't determine your model, it just stores and retrieves your data.<p>So, you end up with 3 types of things in this system... entities, use cases, and data gateways.<p>Your data gateways can still use AR if you want, or something else, it doesn't matter.<p>This isn't my idea, Uncle Bob lays it out better than I can here: <a href=""http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-arch...</a>",1350510403

To the provider, this just looks like a steady stream of traffic from one of their instances to another server somewhere on the Internet: something they see from so many of their customers.  It will attract very little attention so long as they pay their bills.<p>The transit and load balancer servers are another story.  It will become a game of cat and mouse with colocation providers, the same game that spam purveyors played in the days before botnets.  They will get raided and have to set up a new server at some provider elsewhere.  Eventually they will run out of decent providers and have to move somewhere on the fringes of the hosting industry and performance will suffer.<p>A better approach, in my opinion, is to take the whole thing into the cloud and to come up with some sort of P2P protocol that is capable of determining where the transit server(s) live entirely without the aid of centralized DNS.",1350509707

They don't have a quota, not in the usual sense but they do keep track of data on tickets, this includes how many tickets each member is giving out.  They don't require them to give out X tickets per month but what they do look for is members who are not giving out around the same amount of tickets as their peers.  This usually indicates they are not patroling and doing their job.<p>Another thing they can look at with this data is where they are giving out tickets.

Depending on how PayPal's API works, you might be able to do this without having the money actually pass through your account.<p>This would also give you the option of not charging them at all if their problem wasn't solved, but presumably you don't want to do that since it opens the system to abuse.",1350509322

I have too often forgotten what I wanted to do with them, but in the process learned a lot. (Actually <i>a bit</i> for HN standards.) With all this momentum, and given the affordable dedicated servers that can be found today, I decided to try a new adventure: setting up my own virtual servers. The only issue is that now I'm beyond stuck. On the other hand, I really don't want to give up on this.<p>I prefer building my knowledge with textbooks, even if it takes longer, than with copy-and-paste tutorials. But now I can't even seem to find such textbooks or sources. In particular, I'm stuck with the notion of mapping external and internal IP addresses, again while gaining understanding in the process. For example:<p><pre><code>  - When exactly do I need bridging?\n  - When do I need to request a MAC address in connection to the external IP?\n  - Must I map IP to MAC (""bridge_hw"" directive, I believe) explicitly? Why? When?\n  - Where would you use route over iptables?\n</code></pre>\nPlease note that I'm lost, so any attempts to answer these questions would probably lead to new ones! Rather, I'm looking for authoritative (and pedagogic!) sources. I read great things about Benvenuti's ""Understanding Linux Network Internals"", but this seems to take all the way down to kernel-level programming, which I imagine should be avoidable. Maybe ""Linux Network Administrator's Guide"", by Dawson et al, has a more hands-on approach that makes it more recommendable? I often go back to Frisch's ""Essential System Administration"". While I have by no means read it back to back, I believe the kind of discussion I'm seeking is not found at length there.<p>Any references will be greatly appreciated.

Jailbait and creepshots bother me <i>immensely</i> as a photographer (forgetting the regular-human part for a second).<p>But what can you do about it? When I first started shooting street I didn't seek permission from anyone else either, and I'm quite certain I've come off as ""the creep with the camera"" in my hapless beginner stumbling. We don't have the right to restrict the privileges we need, and even if we had the right we'd have no idea how to implement such a restriction.<p>Hell, I probably still do. In fact, I <i>know</i> I still do on occasion.<p>As for privacy - street photography requires at least a <i>little</i> bit of instinctive amorality. Personally - and I've heard other photographers describe the same phenomenon - you train yourself to compose it and shoot it before the other side of your brain kicks in and says ""but wait..."".<p>Faster than the speed of your moral compass? :P<p>I curate <i>very</i> hard, both for my own sake as well as the subjects. Photography is a craft where it's very easy to make untoward implications merely by composing craftily. I scrub all results to make sure crafty composition never comes off negatively on the subject - unless the negative aspect existed as I shot the picture. A man angrily screaming at a police officer? I'll take that. A shot where it <i>looks</i> like someone is eyeing a woman's ass but isn't really? Nope.<p>I also retain copyright on all street photographs. I do not release any street photographs under any CC licenses - I trust my own judgment on where and how to show these photographs, but not others. It's something of a symbolic gesture though - once a JPEG is in the wild your control over it is limited at best.<p>The last part is <i>no homeless pictures ever</i>. There's a <i>huge</i> train of thought behind this one for the sake of brevity I won't expand on.",1350508504

As a non-technical business founder myself, I just can't understand what that guy possibly would have been thinking. I'd never give up that much of my company unless the other party was coming on board as full partner, meaning they're also going to be sharing all the financial and legal risks (and yes, that means contributing money as well as time). If you value your company at all, 40% is a massive sum to pay someone unless they're sharing all the risks with you, not just spending some of their time. Just giving yourself a $1 million dollar valuation, that means paying someone $400,000 to handle just one element of your business...and you could probably get it done a lot cheaper if you just took the time to go through your options.<p>As for finding technically skilled people who are available and want to work, it's not easy, but nothing in business is easy. It's no harder than any other part of a business, it just requires persistence and knowing where to look (I should know, I've hired a bunch of them in the last 6 months).

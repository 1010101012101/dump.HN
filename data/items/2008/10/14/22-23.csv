(Download the USB 2.0 spec and check out the wire protocol.)  The fastest you can transfer data is with a bulk transfer, which top out at 53248000 Bps = 406.25 Mbps.  (<i>That's</i> what I would call the ""theoretical speed"".)  Other transfer types are slower.<p>Companies like advertising ""480 Mbps"" because it's a high number, but it's not physically possible to transfer data over USB2 that fast.",1224024611

1. Offensive - Defensive line play
2. Offiensive coordinator versus the defensive coordinator in play calling, formations... (tactical)
3. The safety verus the quarterback.
4. The corners versus the wideouts.
5. Coach strategy. (strategic)
6. Specific Matchups ... 
7. QB versus defensive coordinator.<p>Its all in there ... You have to be able to see it. I was going to write a document on understanding all this from the  position and number of players at the line of scrimmage - ie what they show on TV during the play ... but I've not yet had time :( ...<p>The thing is in a team sport you can either be long on action and short on strategy or vice versa. The main tradeoff is the amount of communication required between players.<p>I love American Football more than any sport because of the amount of strategy + the great quality of players that you get over here.",1264676013

Every platform has its pros and cons, as a developer you get to choose what's important to you when picking a platform to target.<p>People who want to write software will always pick open systems. People who aren't techies or creatives just want technology to serve a purpose (users of information appliances), and just want things to work with the minimal amount of fuss. Locking things down simplifies a lot of things for end users.<p>The panic over every platform that gets released that isn't suitably open, just makes me think of this Alan Kay quote:<p>""In fact, let’s not even worry about Java. Let’s not complain about Microsoft. Let’s not worry about them because we know how to program computers, too, and in fact we know how to do it in a meta-way.

Instead of realizing and building what our users want, we constantly tread water and waste our time on issues (important to us, and us only) like opening our code. This has no tangible benefit (nor harm, to be fair), yet it's something we fight about instead of spending this time building slick, efficient UIs.<p>For example, I just read a most interesting exchange on a board, where one guy was going on about how the video experience sucks because there's no DVD drive - it's completely missing the forest for the trees, getting hung up about a single insignificant detail that's at the very best a nice-to-have.

Just think about this question to see how this article is utterly nonsensical. Contrary to what the Apple apologists are saying Apple do not have ""user experience"" as it main concern. What is really happening is just a transition, Apple is becoming more and more a digital content distributor and less of the hardware/software company that it was in the past will remain, but it will not be obliterated, and the iPad is just a materialization of this police of a company that is trying to win more money in this market.",1264673714

The fear, however, is that this device, and others like it, will someday vastly reduce the market for general-purpose devices.<p>There is no particular person in the wrong, and I wouldn’t call it “evil,” exactly, that all of our devices are now impossible to repair for the average person, or even the enthusiastic hobbyist: clocks, cameras, radios, automobiles, telephones ... everything we use is becoming too complex for people to understand, except in a rough, schematic way.<p>This has tremendous benefits, as we can make more sophisticated devices, with useful features, and our lives become more comfortable. But you must admit it also has a down-side: we lose the ability to repair, to tinker, to reverse-engineer, to understand our surroundings, to personally implement incremental improvements, etc. Each user sacrifices a little bit of control for a little bit of comfort, incrementally.<p>The bit of knowledge we do have about science ends up coming from top-down mandated curricula, purely theoretical understanding learned through books, rather than from practical experience cooking our own meals, tending our own gardens, crafting our own furniture, fixing our own appliances.<p>I believe that computers are amazingly useful and powerful general-purpose devices, and understanding how to program them can be extremely empowering, because it allows people to solve their own problems. If all you have is an iPad and a DVR and a built-in car GPS and a cell phone, you can only use them on the problems that other people already solved, and if your problem is different, you’re shit out of luck.",1264673403

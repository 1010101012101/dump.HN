297541,comment,297369,297459,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"Ugh, no. You would just create a super-parasite. Evolution is parsimonious. You would need to know how to build a mind the simple way in order to direct evolution down just that one path that leads to minds - and meanwhile you'd have cruelly killed millions of by-then thinking feeling persons who didn't quite measure up. And who knows what other tendencies you'd have created aside from intelligence? The whole thing would be a nightmare.",1220802171

297534,comment,297496,297496,0,0,dkokelley,,,"A similar story that I heard, though it didn't turn out as well:<p>A student was taking an exam for his class, and had finished most of the exam, minus the extra credit problem at the end. Because this student didn't know the answer to the question, he got creative. He drew a picture of a man holding a gun to someone (maybe it was a puppy or something cute, I'd have to see the exam again) with the text ""Give me the credit, or the (cute animal) dies!""<p>When he got the paper back, he noticed the teacher's grade to the extra credit problem: 0, with the text ""I don't negotiate with terrorists.""<p>I've seen a picture of the exam before on my friends ipod, but I don't remember if he found it online or if it happened to someone he knew. Anyways, it's a funny story that this article reminded me of.",1220801772
297532,comment,297369,297433,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"I don't agree we can't build a machine that out-thinks us, because the early iterations at least would be specialist self-improvement tools - NOT general intelligence. Glorified whole-program optimizers.<p>AI needs to be built from a theory of mind and a theory of intelligence - but there is reason for hope, as a combination of neuroscience and mathematics (cf: AIXI) is attacking this question. AI also needs to be built from a  theory of ""friendliness"" (goals compatible with humanity) and there are people (cf: SIAI) working on this.<p>Your message strikes me as having the ""mankind will never achieve heavier-than-air flight"" quality. (As opposed to the ""mankind will never exceed lightspeed"" quality - there is no fundamental physics in the way.)",1220801714

It's unclear exactly how the federal government ""implicitly"" backed Fannie and Freddie, besides occasional congressional meddling and the companies' history as GSEs, but other financial agencies and investors treated them as if they knew the government would step in if there was a problem -- and it turns out they were right.",1220801143

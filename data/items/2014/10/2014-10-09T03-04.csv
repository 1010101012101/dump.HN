8430746,comment,8425501,8430261,0,0,ijk,,,"Well, Kain&#x27;s article is a description of the exact kind of harassment campaign described in the original article. So the first sense I meant is that the contents of the article are the exact thing talked about.<p>For the DMCA: &quot;unverifiable&quot; is probably a better description than &quot;unsourced&quot;, but the part I wanted to highlight was how this whole thing followed the exact playbook described in Kathy Sierra&#x27;s essay.<p>Second, while Kain is trying to take a balanced approach, he unfortunately only looks at the surface of the issues, reporting the accusations in great detail. This is a dynamic that&#x27;s <i>also</i> pointed out in the original article: uncritically accepting a new martyr while glossing over the original harassment. Lots about &quot;gamers are over&quot; and TFYC, virtually nothing about the mob harassment for anyone other than Phil Fish. And absolutely nothing about the organized astroturfing in the IRC channels, which has been documented extensively.<p>The accusations are repeated without much introspection, in a way that it can be used as an apologetic hammer against either side. It may not be actively harmful in itself, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to actually inform the reader of all of the issues.<p>For an even-handed look at the topic, I&#x27;d rather suggest, say, a scholarly look at the issues that acknowledges some of the problems: <a href=""http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/we-will-force-gaming-to-be-free/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/we-will-force-gaming-to-be...</a> or at least an article by someone who is less personally involved than Kain is: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/6/6111065/gamergate-explained-everybody-fighting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2014/9/6/6111065/gamergate-explained-ever...</a>",1412827112

I&#x27;m happy to hear we&#x27;re on the same side, then. This time I agree with what you say about CFAA. The punishments are too high which, as you say, gives prosecutors an unfair amount of leverage. I&#x27;m simply trying to inject a dose of realism into the YC conversation on this issue: unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think any judge is going to strike down, or meaningfully limit CFAA any time soon. The legal arguments just are not there.<p>Damn. Oh well. What can we do? :)<p>> If we want it fixed, we need to come up with a strategy to get Congress to fix it. That won&#x27;t be easy, but I think it may be the only way. (Of course, CFAA is only one of many criminal laws that need to be reformed in precisely the same way. Drug laws are, of course, another great example.)<p>Agreed.<p>> I do want to try to dispel just a bit of your cynicism about the criminal justice system, though. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say a lot about the state systems, but I can tell you from extensive first hand experience behind the scenes in the federal court system that the plea bargaining process (and all the rest of it) works pretty much as advertised.<p>This was the State of Florida system, not the Federal one, so it&#x27;s probably corrupt in different quantities than the one I witnessed firsthand. :)",1412826438

We took a calculated call with the editor. For the consumer, a structured tabular view of ingredients make sense but for the author, the structured way of entering it in tables becomes a chore.

There is no end to the ways in which people may enter ingredients. Our bet is, once the user get to see how it is presented on the final output, the second time they will start visualising the way it needs to be entered. A bit of mutual learning. Meanwhile, we keep looking for patterns and keep correcting these rough edges.<p>Also there are tons of use cases that we try to solve here.

Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say a lot about the state systems, but I can tell you from extensive first hand experience behind the scenes in the federal court system that the plea bargaining process (and all the rest of it) works pretty much as advertised. While prosecutors may be overzealous, there is no shady back room business going on behind judges and prosecutors in strip clubs or anywhere else. (I&#x27;m not saying, of course, that it NEVER happens, but that, if it does, it would be a rarity and all the other judges would be aghast. The actual culture among federal judges would never condone what you&#x27;ve described.)  This doesn&#x27;t mean that defendants always get a fair chance. They typically have few resources, little knowledge of the system, and are threatened with huge penalties (though at least in federal court the appointed representation actually tends to be decent).

8430639,comment,8429561,8430330,0,0,chipsy,,,"I think there are a number of attitudes engendered by the nature of doing game programming, especially low-level engine programming, for a long time. Game programmers aren&#x27;t unaware of the rest of the programming universe, but the risks mean that they tend to indulge only one or two new ideas at a time for production code.<p>One such attitude is that the code is disposable - you cut down the buglist until the game ships, and then boom, new project, greenfield code. (or sometimes, same engine, but you can go in and gut it until it fits the new design) Another is that your primary goal as the engine programmer is to push out data as quickly as possible - more things onscreen, with more detail and more effects; if you aren&#x27;t doing this, then you&#x27;re probably spending your technical budget to explore a completely new technology instead. Higher-level abstractions are weeded out if they aren&#x27;t supplementing these goals.<p>This means that game programmers see the code as something that you scrub out and redo over and over in order to match the new data model you&#x27;re optimizing against(which necessarily changes as hardware and design goals changes). You&#x27;re gonna throw the code out tomorrow, so there&#x27;s no sense in spending a lot of &quot;thinking and theorizing&quot; time on it to reach artificial ideals. You have a clear destination to reach instead.<p>The ideal provided as an alternative is to reduce your coding to an efficient, even boring process that consistently gets you towards a working solution that can be optimized later, even whilst you&#x27;re keeling over from crunch. Game coders don&#x27;t optimize everything right off the bat because they need real-world data for the test case, so the engine only really gets performance tuned in the later stages of a project as more of the content is completed. The early days are often more important because they&#x27;re done with the understanding that all the maintenance work needed to ship must be done before ship, so you can only take on technical debt on a feature if it means the feature will never be touched again; otherwise the only reason to do it is to hit one of those stupid publisher milestones that requires a feature to be in place prematurely.<p>Another issue is that not all abstractions are available. Stuff reliant on GC is generally out, because control over memory allocation is a must. Stuff that bloats memory usage, also generally out. Stuff that leads to unpredictable execution times(e.g. lazy evaluation) is dismissed immediately. Imperative style is still the groundwork for game code, if only because simulated worlds encourage massive amounts of mutability and global state.<p>So at the same time there&#x27;s a tunnel vision that comes out of this approach. Not every game needs that level of optimization, and not every optimization is a matter of peering at the hardware and seeing what form the data needs to be in for go-fastness(which is 90% of the Acton slides). But because the programmer also can&#x27;t predict &quot;how much&quot; performance is enough, they tend to estimate conservatively, defer to C++ and to their hardware once more, and just pull out the old bag of tricks to make it go. And then ship at 30hz when it turns out that the estimate still wasn&#x27;t good enough for 60.",1412824586

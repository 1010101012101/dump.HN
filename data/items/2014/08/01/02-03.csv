8118195,comment,8114919,8118158,2,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Would that include not adding:&quot;<p>A whole bunch of completely standard features to add to a mutable-state dynamic scripting language, almost each and every one of which had been successfully added to a mutable-state dynamic scripting language before PHP did it? Of course not.<p>(I&#x27;m not sure about that last one, though I suspect one could find a version of Perl early into its reference experimentations that would have an equivalent problem. Even today, I&#x27;m not sure if a function that returns a list (not list ref) can be directly dereferenced into via [] notation. Or at least it&#x27;s klunky. And let me clarify that I do mean <i>added</i> to an existing language, not programmed in from the beginning, which is a very different problem.)<p>I&#x27;d also add generators into that list.<p>Adding pervasive threading is a different story. Adding threading to a mutable-state dynamic scripting language has a long and sordid history... even when it is nominally successful (as in Python) it is still not very useful, and at times it has been simply a failure (like Perl).<p>As another example, though, I would suggest the principle would be firmly against trying to add Hindley-Milner typing to the language, or making some big move in an immutable direction. That&#x27;s not PHP... that&#x27;s not &quot;mutable-state dynamic scripting language&quot;. I&#x27;d also suggest against burning any time in trying to make PHP not a &quot;scripting&quot; language anymore, on the grounds that Hack is the right approach; create a companion language that may integrate well, may even still be a &quot;dialect&quot; of PHP, but is not &quot;PHP&quot; anymore, and can do the non-scripting work without actually trying to bodge that into PHP proper.<p>&quot;PS: PHP already supports threading via a PECL module.&quot;<p>Yeah. Perl &quot;supports&quot; threading too... for sufficiently small definitions of &quot;supports&quot;. Unsurprisingly, when I googled &quot;PHP thread&quot; (without quotes in the search), once you get past what are for me the first three links which are for the documentation itself, the remainder of the results consist of people asking and/or explaining why you can&#x27;t trust it or use it. Compare with the Google search for &quot;perl thread&quot;. (Pretty much the same except with Perl, even the documentation warns you away from using it.)<p>PHP is a mutable-state dynamic scripting language. It can continue importing anything it likes from that realm as all the mutable-state dynamic scripting languages continue to converge on the same basic core of features, which I have in the past called CLispScript but really there&#x27;s any number of things you could reasonably call it. Good threading support is not in that core set of features. The history of other extremely similar languages extremely strongly suggests it would be little more than a staggeringly enormous waste of time.<p>But of course, if PHP would like to ignore that history, go nuts. I see no reason to believe that its internals and API are so especially cleanly designed that threading will be a breeze to add on, but hey, go prove me wrong. (That might sound like a sarcastic snipe at PHP at first. And I won&#x27;t lie, I don&#x27;t like PHP. But the truth is simply that adding threading on 20 years later is <i>insanely difficult</i> if you haven&#x27;t been planning for it all along, and that&#x27;s pretty much regardless of the underlying language. If you have been planning for it it&#x27;s merely very difficult. So very, very many things will fundamentally depend on the implicit lock that you get by everything being single-threaded that you don&#x27;t even realize it until you try to add the threading on and realize just how <i>thoroughly</i> the assumption has been baked into the VM, the runtime, every library, every framework, every binding... everything.)<p>For another &quot;see also&quot;, look at Javascript, another fairly similar language to PHP in the grand land of programming languages (mutable-state dynamic scripting language). There is a <i>reason</i> we have &quot;Web Workers&quot; and we don&#x27;t have &quot;Javascript Threading&quot;, and it isn&#x27;t all &quot;browser&quot;.<p>Incidentally, since for I don&#x27;t even know what reason HN has somehow decided that my first post is unworthy, do note that it&#x27;s a serious engineering question. Spending design capital on &quot;keeping things safe for future threading&quot; is not free, and if there really isn&#x27;t any chance that PHP is going to be threaded in the future, you&#x27;re better off claiming the bounty of staying single-threaded in the spec than complexifying it with things that will never be used, because being able to <i>guarantee</i> single-threadedness is actually a big win in its own way... if you&#x27;ve got it, <i>use</i> it. And, again, the actual <i>history</i> of adding threading to this sort of language is not very promising at all.<p>(Edit: A bit more searching finds a few people suggesting that PHP threading may be usable, though it made the transition to that quite recently. It still doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d touch after all the other times I&#x27;ve been burned in other environments with similar level of promises and experiences. YMMV.)",1406861891

If one closely examines the history of OPEC, there is little evidence that it has had any significant impact on the determination of oil prices since the 1970s.  Foreign aid seems to be used for all sorts of unproductive (and sometimes unintelligible) reasons, which can easily be demonstrated by looking at where the foreign aid budget is spent.

I will eventually fail after some number of checks of course, but this means PayPal can stop sending IPNs and everything will just keep going along just fine.<p>If the user might not end up back on your site for some reason, run a cronjob that tries to verify transactions created in the past day/hour/whatever.<p>An issue like this doesn&#x27;t have to, and really shouldn&#x27;t, cripple your business.",1406858709
8118083,comment,8089321,8093002,1,0,mistercow,,,">Unless you believe correlation is providing evidence of causation here:<p>In both cases, yes, it is evidence of causation. However the low prior probability of causation in each case massively overwhelms the evidence provided by observing a correlation.<p>Here&#x27;s an easy way to tell if A is evidence of B: ask the inverse question - is &quot;not A&quot; evidence of &quot;not B&quot;. If so, it is trivially provable that the answer is yes.",1406858698

That Paypal fails at them this badly makes me think their infrastructure is a (much larger) disaster waiting to happen; if I still did freelance work, I would be moving all of my clients to Stripe right now, before the next inevitable mishap.",1406858620
8118079,comment,8117091,8118041,23,0,rayiner,,,"The &quot;sea of nodes&quot; approach is just a data structure for representing a program in SSA form. It&#x27;s orthogonal to anything that has an impact on speed. E.g. GCC uses a tree representation, LLVM uses a CFG, and Hotspot (C2 and Graal) uses a &quot;sea of nodes&quot; representation, but they all represent code in SSA form and that representation is orthogonal to the quality of particular optimizations implemented within the framework.<p>The speedup reported in that paper is from running constant propagation and dead code elimination at the same time instead of doing them separately, which finds more constants and dead code because the two problems are coupled. The same process can be implemented in a more traditional CFG representation (and generally is--sparse conditional constant propagation).",1406858580

I can tell you with 100% certainty they do no, and the cost to the tax payer of doing so would be astronomical. Most bad patents are rejected, but you never hear any news about that do you? Selection bias is clearly at play here, and only idiots would think that examples of a few poor partents are evidence the system is broken. There are definitely issues with the system, but the system is not completely broken as some who have no knowledge of the issue would have you believe.",1406858505

Agricultural water use in California exceeds urban water use by a factor of almost 4x, and exceeds industrial use (broadly defined, minus agricultural industry) by at least 16x. Agriculture is the elephant in the room. Residential water use (lawns!) is a distant second. Everything else is a very distant third.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_211EHChapter2R.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_211EHChapter2R.pdf</a>",1406858502

In my experience (which is exactly within this field) people use a fairly tight subset of the English vocabulary.<p>So I would be quite happy to test for a dictionary of, say, 100,000 words and be hopeful of a good hit rate (note that XKCD says <i>common</i> words, which is easily missed)<p>Our software has a test (which runs about third in its list of tests) which does dictionary combinations up to three words (two words is quite a commonly used password based on our statistics) with a dictionary size of <s>175,000</s>17,500. (Edit: sorry, apparently it is an order of magnitude smaller, I checked with one of the engineers :)) This includes English words plus a few commonly used foreign/slang terms. The hit rate on this is fairly high.<p>(we crack document/windows passwords mainly)<p>You could of course choose deliberately obscure words to invalidate this - but they aren't so easy to remember (so people will tend not to).<p>If someone is going out of their way to secure a password, sure, you're going to hit a brick wall. But what every password scheme tends to forget is the ""human factor"" whereby people not concentrating on being secure will introduce attack vectors.",1313071133

Adding an extra number, or punctuation, or certain numbers of repetitions generally adds only a little bit of entropy for a significant cost in additional challenge to your memory.<p>Our minds are well suited to remembering combinations of common words, and by stringing a few such words together, you can generate a larger search space than using a single word with a few substitutions.  Even if the attacker knows the scheme you're using, he still must search through the space of combinations of common words, which XKCD is pointing out is quite large.",1313071078

That's not how the economy works.<p>Savings should be the most obvious. You're not going to save your money by hiding it under your mattress. You're going to at least put it into a bank, of not invest in equity or debt instruments. In all of these cases, the money is going right back into the economy to be used productively. If you put it into a bank, they'll loan it back out to someone in a mortgage or such. Equity investment directly fund businesses. And so on. So when you're saving, you're really redirecting the money to someone who believes he has a use for it -- and who believes strongly enough that they're willing to pay for the right to try it. And this is actually what the OP wanted in the first place, but the current system has <i>better</i> controls for ensuring that the money is used productively.<p>If I spend the money -- say, on a leaky roof, as you suggest -- then that money is going to the roofing contractor, and thence to his employees and the producers of the shingles and other materials. Again, it's being used productively.<p>Less obvious is if I spend the money on a TV, for example. Some of that money goes to the retailer. But much of it is going to, say, a Chinese company that makes it. This gets into more economic theory like ""comparative advantage"", which I'm not going to explain here, but simply state that in the bottom line it still makes us better off. People will protest that this contributes to the so-called ""trade deficit"". In the case of this discussion (at the very least), that trade deficit is a <i>good thing</i>. If we (collectively, somehow, for the sake of simplicity) owe a Chinese company some money, that is precisely the same thing as <i>them</i> pumping stimulus money into our economy! Perhaps you buy a Japanese car; that ""trade deficit"" is actually executed by, say, Toyota using the ""owed"" money to build a factory in America, and that again is exactly what we want.",1313069742

The difference is that in the US people believe that they will be making more and more every year while in Sweden you don't. So they think they will own tomorrow the money to pay back what they spend today.<p>Are they right? Well, from 1970 to 2010 US economy has grown at an average of 2,9% per year, while Sweden by 2,1% (1). This is a huge difference, almost 50% more. So yes, they are both right :)<p>(1) Figures are GDP growth at market prices, source: OECD",1313068347

While the discussions are exciting, I've noticed myself trying to creep more and more features into version 1. It's a bit of a distraction and requires a conscious effort on my behalf to prevent it (i.e. more work). That being said, I do feel there is some value in speaking with customers before v1. Knowing whether or not there's a demand for your product and learning what's really <i>wrong</i> with what's available is a great thing. It's up to the entrepreneur, though, to make sure that those ideas don't cloud the focus of your current work, or make you feel as though they have to appear in v1.

It's just that, until now, there were no devices other than PCs that would give them everything they wanted - the ability to communicate, play games, watch videos, listen to music, surf the web, read mail etc. - all in one package.<p>Now, as smartphones and tablets get more and more powerful, it's very likely that people will sooner or later abandon their PCs in favour of devices that offer those same features at a lower price, and that are both simpler to use and more portable than PCs.<p>PCs will survive, though.

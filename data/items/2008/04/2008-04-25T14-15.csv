173561,comment,172915,173016,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Am I the only one that thinks 'startup' simply means a new business without profits? This just seems like a silly semantic debate. 37signals was a startup once, it just happened to choose a different outcome.<p>Every startup should be free to choose their outcome, and if most choose to try and quickly flip, then more power to them. If they choose to try and build a profitable independent business, great! There is no need to turn the 'liquidity event' vs 'sustainable business' camps into warring factions, like some weird language flame war.<p>It was refreshing at SUS to see a contrasting opinion, but neither side is trying to argue that their way is the <i>only</i> way. Both ways obviously work, and I think anyone would be happy with either of them over not succeeding at all.",1209134433

On the bright side, it used to be unusably slow (for large projects, anyway) when doing things like status, diff, or commit, but these have all become considerably faster in recent releases, so there's hope that the still-slow commands will become fast in the future too.<p>I agree with you about usability.  Nearly everything in bzr just works, which was why I ultimately decided against using hg (no dumb server support?  ouch!) or git (where you need to understand its internals far too well in order to get anything done).",1209132395
173530,comment,172915,173000,0,0,sanj,,,"I think that this is an important point.  The term ""startup"" has been narrowed to the point where it doesn't include what are disparagingly referred to as ""lifestyle companies"".<p>And I think that's really unfortunate because controlling the language controls the thinking.<p>Let's face it: people (at least in tech circles) think it is very cool to be in a startup.  And it is in the VCs interests to further that sense -- of being caught up in something big and exciting.<p>It lends a rockstar sensibility to a startup that is NOT conferred to a lifestyle company.<p>Even reading at Paul's posting on this tends to reinforce that subtle dig -- look at the examples: ""landscaping company or a shoe store or a restaurant"".  None of those sound exciting to me.<p>Perhaps my issue is that the measure of ""grow very large"" is ambiguous.  Does it mean large profits?  Sorry, Facebook.  Large revenues?  Sorry Youtube.  Spending lots of money?  Yay Webvan!  Perhaps it means employing lots of people -- which the left-winger in me approves of mightily!<p>I've always felt that the goal should be to touch as many lives a possible.  That's my personal metric on which I base ""large"".  This is consistent with Paul's examples -- you can touch a limited number of people with a landscaping company or a shoe store or a restaurant.<p>But on the web you can touch a LOT of lives with a small set of money.  I would hazard that David's touched far more lives at 37Signals through their consumer products and through Rails than all by one or two of the startups on YC or part of YC.<p>That's large.<p>In my world, that counts as a startup.",1209132195
173529,comment,173310,173310,0,0,dangoldin,,,"From the Wikipedia page:<p>In academic circles it has been argued that, under certain circumstances, these clauses are not economically efficient in that the partner who values the company most is not always the one that ends up buying the company. De Frutos and Kittsteiner suggest in their paper that in order to ensure an efficient outcome, there should not be a contractual obligation for the party who triggers the clause to name the price. Instead, they advocate including in the termination agreement a clause stating that the parties will negotiate for the right to be the person who chooses whether to buy or sell at the price specified by the other partner. They suggest that this negotiation takes the form of an ascending auction where the shareholders bid for the right not to set the price per share. Each partner raises his/her bid continuously, but either partner can drop out of the auction at any time. The party that drops out becomes the one who must propose the price per share, but that person receives a payment from the other partner equal to the bid at which the auction ended. The first and most well known of these specialty firms is The Shotgun Fund(tm).<p>Why not put something along those lines in the contract?",1209132119

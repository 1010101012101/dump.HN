We know our own perceived flaws far better than anybody else does; in our culture of image obsession, it is far too easy to assume that every person in the world is judging you for every little imperfection on your face and of your body.<p>There have absolutely been experiments conducted about people's self-perceptions as compared to others' perceptions of them. This is nothing new. But it's far more interesting to look at than your average psychological study, and since it's not saying anything especially groundbreaking  does anybody <i>really</i> think strangers would be more critical of a woman than that woman would be of herself?

5564165,comment,5562909,5562966,1,0,VLM,,,"Something that I'm curious about is the officially release pixs show it used RC car stuff.  Some official newspaper type places are already claiming it was a lone-gunman scenario for no apparent reason.  Whats never explained is how a dude carrying two backpacks plus another backpack of short range RC car transmitters wasn't noticed carrying three bulky bags and crossing the street to plant both.<p>Also where did the dude go to use two bulky RC car transmitters to set off the bombs?  Can't be far away.  Portapotties?  Look for one with two RC car transmitters dropped in them?  I would imagine that would help with DNA analysis too, having 1000s of peoples samples in there.<p>So the vigilantes need to find pix of the portapotties, which I suspect were within a a hundred feet of the blasts.  In fact their location combined with the predicted blast size probably defined where the blasts happened as the bombers would want to be just outta range of the blast while still having a great RC car signal.<p>TLDR is the witch hunt should be searching for two guys with bulky backpacks and one guy with a weirdly shaped pack who left the portapotties with a much smaller backpack right after the two booms.",1366203391

5564146,comment,5563792,5563792,37,0,davidroberts,,,"I think they are failing because sometime in the mid-Nineties, in the effort to compete with lean and hungry overseas companies, they lost their legendary reputation for quality and customer service, as they tried to respond to changing circumstances.<p>A couple of examples of my own:<p>Around 1996, I bought a cassette recorder made by Aiwa, which had been a fairly upscale electronics brand. It looked nice from the outside, but when I examined it closer after buying it, I realized it was a fairly crude, generic cassette recorder of the time, made in China, probably the generic output from a factory there that Aiwa had slapped their name onto.<p>It failed in less than a month. I brought it to the store for a replacement and that one failed too within thirty days, exactly the same way the first one did. Obviously, Aiwa had not done extensive testing on this model, and I think probably didn't even design or supervise its manufacture.<p>In the early 2000s, I bought a Sony Palm OS PDA. It was very advanced and had great features that I loved. But it failed in two weeks due to bad connection to the lamp that lit the LED display. After a few minutes' search on the Internet, I saw this was a well-known problem with this device, caused by a design flaw.<p>I took it back to the store, and got a replacement that failed exactly the same way in two weeks. The store wouldn't give me another, so I had to rely on Sony's warranty service.<p>It was my worst-ever warranty experience. After a long conversation with customer service reps in India, I was able to convince them it was actually failing. They sent me a box to return it in. It took almost a month to come back, only to fail with the same problem about three months later.<p>I went through the whole process again, waited another month. This time the repaired (or replaced) device came back rattling around in a box with no packing material. It too failed, several days after the one-year warranty expired.<p>I think the decline of the Japaneses electronic giants has been caused by a combination of several things. Japanese technology companies built their reputations during the late Sixties and Seventies, at the start of the Japanese economic boom, when they had a highly skilled workforce willing to work at relatively low wages, compared to the US or Europe. They had already sharpened their quality and innovative abilities in the intense domestic Japanese market, which was extremely competitive and where the consumers were very picky about quality. That market was protected, so there was almost no competition from overseas.<p>When they moved into Western markets, they were the young, scrappy underdog taking on dinosaur companies like RCA and Phillips, that could not respond fast enough to compete effectively against them. They were also aided by the low value of the yen relative to the dollar, which made their products a very good value.<p>So all of these things have changed. Complaints of unfair trade eventually forced Japan to open their domestic market to overseas competition. As the article pointed out, now Japanese companies are the dinosaurs in their domestic market, competing against Apple and Samsung. Meanwhile, the yen is very high against foreign currencies, which hurts them badly in export markets.<p>The Japanese labor market has also changed. Younger Japanese are much less willing to work with the dedication their parents and grandparents had. Wages have gone up, and are equal to or higher than those in the US and Europe, and like those countries, they have tried to cut costs by shifting manufacturing overseas, which has resulted in a decline in quality.<p>Also, the Japanese population is declining, with fewer and fewer young workers, and those coming into the job market have been conditioned to expect comfortable, high-paying, lifetime office jobs, not manufacturing jobs.<p>Meanwhile, the inefficiencies of the lifetime employment system in Japanese companies have made it very difficult to adapt to changing circumstances by laying off workers, even as that system is starting to break down.<p>It's like a perfect storm of bad news for Japanese companies, but in many ways it is very similar to what happened to electronics giants in the US thirty years earlier as they tried to defend against Japanese competition and eventually failed.",1366203234

Looking closely at the electronic speed controller PCB in the (cruddy, low res) pictures, those look like Traxxas connectors still attached to the ESC and you linked to a Tamiya connector battery.  Whatever glob of plastic is on the ends of the ESC cables, I've done enough RC over the past decades to tell thats not tamiya connector, not even a heat damaged one, and enough ham radio stuff to tell its not a powerpole or remains thereof.  The orientation of the connector does not look Deans connector like either.  There really are not many popular RC battery connectors out there.  One interesting point to note is the Tamiya connector battery is Amazon's 3rd best seller and although I haven't figured out which Tenergy battery w/ Traxxas connector this is, I'm sure its sales rank is way below 3rd.<p>You can trivially google for RC car traxxas connector and compare the pics to the pix of the ESC used.<p>Of course the overall ""project"" was probably kit bashing a ready to run full kit, not buying bits and pieces off amazon one at a time.

For example, in response to the first PUT, you have:<p><pre><code>  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok\n  Range: bytes=0-99\n  Content-Length: 0\n</code></pre>\nBut the Range header surely can't be used here, since it's a request header and this is a response. A Content-Range header wouldn't be any more appropriate, since you're not actually returning any content (of any amount). Do you really need this info in the response anyway? The sender knows what they sent, and either it was entirely successful (a 2xx response) or it wasn't.<p>Also, if you're going to return a zero-length 200 response, you might as well use 204 No Content instead.<p>Then, when resuming an upload, you send a HEAD that returns the following:<p><pre><code>  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok\n  Content-Length: 100\n  Content-Type: image/jpg\n  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""cat.jpg""'\n  Range: bytes=0-69\n</code></pre>\nAgain, you can't use the Range request header in a response. And the Content-Length should surely be 70, since that's how much content would be returned if this was a GET request. You could possibly include a Content-Range of 0-69/100 if the server wanted to communicate the expected file size, but I'm not convinced that's necessary and seems something of an abuse of that header.<p>Finally, the response to the resumed PUT has the same problems as the first PUT response. It should probably just be a 204 No Content response - no Content-Length or Range headers required.",1366201742

And its all rather tasteless humor so I scrolled past it pretty quick for better stuff (aka pretty much ANYTHING other than jokes about blown up people)  I'm surprised this is still ""of interest"" today.<p>The properly journalistic way to look at this is in context, you REALLY need to look for instance at the reddit posts on the same topic immediately before and after which show the probably late mr dorner being responsible in one via some pretty amusing CSI style animated gif photoshop work, and another photoshop job doing the same with spiderman (no kidding).  And some dumb anime ones, and the usual racial slurs, etc.  However in a giant sea of photoshops, this one story is gaining traction.  Probably because its politically correct to assume an angry white dude did it, whereas the similar photoshops of arabs in turbans are too politically incorrect (aside from also being completely ridiculous and tasteless).<p>Now the question of the day is who is this dude who probably got photoshopped in, and I'm not a huge Stargate fan by any means (err, well...) but I am about 95% sure this was a generic uniformed dude from SG:U or SG:Atlantis.  Now it could all be real in which case SG:U or SG:Atlantis uniforms are going to be solely for the tasteless next Halloween, or its just vaguely coincidental that the the SG uniform people used some pretty much off the shelf stuff from Gander Mountain or uscav and it means pretty much nothing.<p>I wrote a bunch of stuff about which episode of SG:U I think this uniform and backpack comes from, but the pix is so low res and I'm working from memory, so I deleted it.<p>I don't know whats more embarrassing, a bunch of people getting all worked up believing one pix on a site known for ""funny"" photoshops is authentic, or me admitting in public that I watch syfy network sometimes, even worse I got roped into watching SG:U and I'm still kinda pissed they never had any closure to the series.<p>I guess if there is any ""startup lesson"" here for the HN community its that you can't usefully research something in total isolation of its surroundings.<p>That doesn't mean its absolutely false, just probably.

Trying to build something like that without a framework was a huge pain, and JMVC helped here a lot.<p>In last few years (after I started working for Bitovi) I worked on pretty big enterprise level applications, and besides being able to build things in cleaner way, a huge plus was ability to allow less experienced developers (from the companies we did consulting for) to implement stuff with familiar structure and without needing to care about memory leaks, zombie events and similar stuff.<p>IMO CanJS is the best framework currently available, but I'm extremely biased. In the end I don't think it matters which framework people choose because they will get a lot of value just by using any of them.<p>That said, I would never again use a DOM-centric approach for frontend apps.

I agree that the best biz people are the ones who come from a technical background and have successful transitioned into a biz dev mindset. I've seen it many times. The people who understand both how to build products and how to sell them are rare and extremely valuable.",1226793170

Digg has a huge staff, what's everyone doing if they can't get more than one or two people to watch the content?",1226793021
365625,comment,365386,365386,0,0,lliiffee,,,"My favorite NP-complete cheat: You want to solve an integer programming problem, something like<p><pre><code>  max sum_i x_i f_i\n</code></pre>\nWhere the x_i are restricted to be binary.  The cheat:  Just let the x_i be real numbers in the [0,1] interval, and solve the problem through a super-efficient linear programming solver.  <i>If you happen</i> to end up with a solution where all the x_i are binary, you have successfully found a solution to the original problem.  If you aren't so lucky, well...<p>This is simple, fast, and works amazingly well amazingly often.",1226792806

365617,comment,365331,365545,0,0,Locke,,,"I'm not sure your post deserves to be downmodded -- it seems honest and on topic.  I can see how one bit in particular could come off as slightly offensive:<p>'Speaking only for myself, any candidate who starts going down the road of ""I won't fill out employment application until we are interested in each other"", ""I won't discuss previous salary"", ""I won't provide references until there is an offer letter"", etc... - just screams ""Prima Donna""'<p>This is a matter of trust.  Salary history, a detailed employment history, and references are private.  In the case of references it would be down right rude, to repay the people who are willing to vouch for you by spamming their contact info to anyone who asks.  There is nothing unreasonable about withholding that info until both sides clearly serious about moving forward.  If anything, I wonder what your cavalier attitude screams about you?",1226791678

365614,comment,365274,365359,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"There's a lot of fabless IC design startups around here in Silicon Valley and some of them are run like white-collar sweatshops. Second-rate engineers are imported from China or India with low pay but the lure of H1-B sponsorship to work on designs in hopes of flipping it to a bigger semiconductor company or back to OEMs in Asia.<p>This might be what happened but I think his project, or maybe the whole startup since they ride or die on a single product, got fubared and he was let go. He might be in the middle of relocating to the US or trying to get his family over, or maybe the company screwed him over on pay.<p>Either way, it's not an excuse to kill but that might be the motive. He probably already landed back in China by now.",1226791354

365610,comment,365488,365488,0,0,randomwalker,,,"The mention of the Russell-Whitehead proof brought back memories. It's from Principia Mathematica (same title as Newton's book, but it's a different work.) Here's a representative page:<p><a href=""http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cache/a/a/t/aat3201.0001.001/00000401.tifs.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cache/a/a/t/aat3201.0001.001/00000...</a><p>Look at the last line of 54:43. Then look at the page number. This isn't a joke. It's really how bad axiomatic mathematics is.<p>During my last year of high school and first year of college, I was fascinated by this stuff to the point that I couldn't think about anything else. After digesting Peano arithmetic, I moved on to Zermelo-Frenkel set theory (the ""set theory"" that we normally use is self-contradictory and therefore meaningless to a mathematician.) I worked through Godel's incompleteness theorem. I tried my best to understand non-Euclidean geometries. And a bunch of other stuff that I don't even care to remember now.<p>Soon, predictably, it started affecting my health. At that point, I broke down and gave up that shit for good. The stuff I do today is positively quotidian by comparison. But it makes me happy. Even now, I'm occasionally uneasy about living in a universe where we don't know (actually, <i>can't know</i>) if the continuum hypothesis is true or false. But I shove the thought quickly from my head.<p>The point of all this is to tell you guys that unless you really know what you're getting into, don't think too deeply about the meaning of proof :-)",1226790658

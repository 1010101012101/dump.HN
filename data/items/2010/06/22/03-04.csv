I've decided to move on and use the concepts for another project but in the event that others might find it useful I'd like to release the code as open source.<p>Having never done this before I'm not sure the ""best"" way to go about it; simply open up a public repository on github and post the code, or do I need to select a specific license, update the source to reflect this choice, provide documentation, etc.?<p>I'm sure there are no hard-and-fast rules but I'd like to do this in a way that is most beneficial to other developers out there.",1277179198

Then we could make up a good name for the 2-argument arctangent function that inverts the function f(x) = cos(x), sin(x), and call it something much more intuitive than arctan2. Everyone would be much better off.",1277179185

1450875,comment,1448364,1450784,0,0,carbocation,,,"Health care is like auto repair more than it is like purchasing an auto; you were born with this vehicle. I don't understand enough about cars to decide if I should buy Fuel Additive X that's being heavily marketed. Whether I buy it or not is pretty unimportant, because it's just for my car.<p>If someone is trying to sell me an angioplasty, how am I supposed to decide for myself if I need it? Unfortunately, guessing wrong about the necessity of an invasive procedure is more risky than choosing the wrong fuel additive. No consumer guide can answer that question - and if it can, it can just label itself ""medical school"" and I'll respect that. Let's say that some guide says ""angioplasty does not reduce mortality except in the setting of unstable angina or myocardial infarction, so don't get it."" The doctor could come back and say, ""yeah, but you have diabetes and that guide didn't look at studies with patients with diabetes."" (Stuff like this is true and critically important to understanding clinical trials.) Or maybe you have atypical vascular architecture so the guides don't address that. I'm basically trying to get at <i>clinical equipoise</i>. Clinical equipoise occurs more often than you might think; it's a time where well-meaning doctors can disagree with one another because there is not specific enough data (or none at all) to answer the question at hand. I don't see a guide handling that.<p>(Note that I'm saying nothing about whether or not patients can choose <i>physicians</i> intelligently - I think they do it quite well via word of mouth - but I'm referring specifically to the consumption of medical care like medicines and procedures.)",1277178875

Personally I always preferred intense study over one or two weeks to prepare for an exam, but I think that is a personal preference.<p>Here are some things that I learnt from doing exams.  This is aimed at university exams more than high school - the difference being that at (my) university exams typically consisted of a small number of long questions on a particular area, whereas high school was often a large number of small questions.<p>- Make sure you have good exam technique: work out roughly how long you can spend on each question and still finish the exam.  Stick to that timing leaving questions unfinished if necessary (unless you are writing essays, probably better to submit 2 complete essays than 4 incomplete essays).  Read the paper through at the start to work out which questions you think you can do well on.  Do those questions first.  If you get to a hard part on a question don't waste time, skip to the next question and come back to it.  You don't have to do the questions in the order that they are given to you.  It's a game - score as many points as you can by tackling the easy bits first.<p>- If it's a math type paper then you might be able to pick up the odd mark here and there by explaining what method you would have used if only you had the time.<p>- Past papers are the best study tool.  If you have them or can get them then do so and work through the questions.  Ideally work through one or two past papers with your study materials, then do one or two under exam conditions.<p>- If you're really out of time to study then you can gamble: pick the bits of the syllabus that you already know well and focus on mastering those bits, ignore the rest.  Then hope like hell that the questions that come up on the day are on the bit that you studied.  This can work really well or can turn into an utter disaster.",1277176660

It was just something that always slipped my mind.""<p>This example is exactly what I'm talking about.  The mind that was slipping is called <i>working memory</i> by the brain scientists.  It seems to be the seat of focused attention, and is attached to the brain's logic and reasoning circuits.<p>""At some point, I simply chose to remember it and ever since then: no problem.""<p>Habits and actions like this are stored by <i>procedural memory</i>.  It seems to use different brain circuits and signals than working memory, so one can be strong while the other is weak.  Once it learns how to do a process, it tends to be tenacious about holding onto the memory.  The process tends to be triggered by location (kitchen facing the sink) and circumstance (washing up), without much involvement of conscious thought or working memory.  It is the seat of habit and addiction.<p>Procedural memory is why there are so many funny true stories about absent-minded professors who have moved to a new house (generally involving amusing the new owners, then getting hopelessly lost -- repeatedly).<p>""I changed behavior that I had for years and that I always said 'I was just incapable of remembering'.""<p>Indeed.  But years of failure followed by sudden success is not consistent with a rational decision and a well-ordered plan.<p>""Having to defend a choice that goes contrary to societies expectations is much harder than defending a claimed 'incapability'.""<p>I think it goes a lot deeper than simple face saving or effort avoidance.  (Although there's plenty of that!)  The brain seems to have a machine that constantly makes up cause-and-effect stories to explain events, but the logic is usually pretty superficial.  For human events, it tends to latch on to <i>choice</i> as the cause.  ""She nearly hit me because she chose to recklessly answer her cell phone while driving.""  In reality, the ringtone activated her answering procedure, hijacking her brain.  Her fault was not making a decision to be reckless (an act of commission), but rather failing to build a stop-and-think-this-through decision point into the answering procedure (an act of omission).  The thing is, her brain probably makes up the same silly story, and she will not improve if she believes it.<p>There are spectacular examples of this in the brain damage literature.  If you ask certain paralysis patients to hand you a glass of water, and then ask them why they didn't, they will tell you the most wonderful malarkey about how they just didn't want to. Or how they don't want to strain their shoulder.  Or how they are teaching you to take care of your own glass of water.  The OMG-arm-refusing-to-work signal just isn't making it through, but their storyteller is running just fine, thanks.<p>""I bet these people have a hard time keeping relationships going.""<p>The ADHD divorce and family chaos rate is said to be appalling.",1277176624

Cardiac deaths, including strokes, heart attacks etc., have many causes. One of the leading proximate causes is stenosis due to coronary atherosclerosis (which causes infarcts in heart muscle over time), and the mechanism involved there is the development of plaque in the intima of the coronary arteries: this plaque consists of [1] calcium deposits, fibrinogen and lipoprotein. It seems high CRP, fibrinogen and possibly homocysteine trigger calcium deposition and lipoprotein/platelet aggregation, thereby leading to plaque formation.

Hypercholesterolemia is independent of insulin resistance (IR), but IR (aka metabolic syndrome) is highly associated with cardiac mortality. IMHO this supports my point that in most cases, actual cholesterol numbers have very little to do with cardiac mortality (except for a few pathological cases of hypercholesterolemia as defined above some 500mg/dl etc).<p>>  In fact, high LDL is not even part of the metabolic syndrome.<p>Again, that's exactly where I'm coming from. Metabolic syndrome (easiest identified by high triglycerides, low HDL, IR, intra-abdominal obesity [3]) is the ""best"" precursor/predictor for cardiac mortality.<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19839225"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19839225</a><p>> not so much in disagreement as we are talking about different things entirely.<p>To loosely paraphrase Feynman, where there is unexplained data is where science has the potential to advance most.

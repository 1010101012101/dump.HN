9013816,comment,8999412,9007191,0,0,Lazare,,,"You&#x27;re completely confused.<p>What you&#x27;re discussing is that the House (which under the constitution can set their own rules) decided to create a rule XIII(6)(a) that said that bills couldn&#x27;t be passed by the House without a day to consider them except by a 2/3 vote.  Later, the House changed that rule to waive the requirement to wait a day.  Later still, they reinstated it.<p>Colloquially, the waiver of the rule is sometimes referred to as &quot;martial law&quot;, in much the way that proposals to repeal or reform the filibuster rules in the senate are called the &quot;nuclear option&quot;.  The nuclear option does not involve nuclear weapons, and the so-called &quot;martial law&quot; rule in the senate does not involve martial law.  It&#x27;s not even related <i>to</i> martial law.<p>Martial law would be a suspension of civil liberties and an injection of military personnel over civilian authorities; it would also necessitate a repeal of habeas corpus and the posse comitatus act.  What you&#x27;re discussing is a minor (and long since reverted) rule change governing when and in what circumstances draft bills could be brought to a floor vote in the house.<p>The bottom line is this:  The minority party in the house wanted to delay and debate the bailout bill.  The house—which is charged with setting rules about delays and debate by majority vote-set rules which didn&#x27;t allow the minority party to delay and debate as much as they wanted.  Some members of the minority party, in a fit of hyperbole, analogized the rule change to martial law.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It wasn&#x27;t even sort of LIKE martial law.<p>TL;DR:  You&#x27;re so wrong, you didn&#x27;t even understand c-span.",1423313546

9013797,comment,9013261,9013705,0,0,bostik,,,"> <i>no more democratic than say most European states</i><p>I may get flamed or burned for saying this, but I believe we (in Europe and US) are currently pretty close to the ancient form of Greek democracy.<p>In the ancient Greece, the vote was a privilege of the free men. The definition of &quot;free man&quot; on the other hand was not quite what we think of in a modern society. To start with, only a few percent of the population actually was eligible to participate. [0] To qualify as a free man, you needed to have position and/or wealth. Usually the two came together.<p>After all, what good would it do to allow plebs to vote? They could vote against your agenda! Better to control the access to the vote by simply ensuring that at least majority of the voting people already share a certain appreciation for the status quo.<p>&quot;But, but but... We can vote however we want&quot; you say. Sorry, no you can&#x27;t. Thanks to the nature of the system, you get to vote between two or three nearly identical alternatives. Outliers will not be even put on the ballot. (I think California is an exception, which introduces its own downsides.)<p>The choices on the vote are in practice dictated by those with the most power or money. Lawrence Lessig outlined this situation with his only slightly satirical TED talk - a country of Lesters. [1, 2]<p>But back to terminology. If the power is held by those with wealth, and decisions are made purely among the people who have the most to financially gain from them, what do you call such a system? Is there even a descriptive term for a mix of oligarchy and plutocracy?<p><i>The True Greek Democracy</i>?<p>0: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy#Participation_and_exclusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy#Participatio...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://blog.ted.com/2013/04/03/how-we-can-make-elections-about-the-people-not-just-funders-an-excerpt-of-lawrence-lessigs-new-ted-book-lesterland/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ted.com/2013/04/03/how-we-can-make-elections-abo...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_t...</a>",1423313085

It&#x27;s an incoherent mess, a circular, self-defending hall of mirrors that shames people for not caring <i>more</i> about ethnicity and <i>more</i> about gender than they do now, when I think we should be trying to care <i>less</i> about those things.<p>Why isn&#x27;t it rape when a woman has sex with a man too drunk to give consent? Because men can&#x27;t be the victims of rape. Why not? Because it&#x27;s not really rape unless it&#x27;s done by men to women as a way of maintaining a rigid hierarchy of domination.<p>Why isn&#x27;t it female privilege when women aren&#x27;t required to sign up for the draft, or can comfort a stranger&#x27;s young child, or are one tenth as likely to be incarcerated, or enjoy any of a thousand other undeserved advantages conferred by society? Because, by definition, those advantages are all benign sexism. <i>Anything</i> that appears at first glance to your ignorant eyes to be female privilege is actually benign sexism, and the fact that you thought it might be female privilege is just more evidence of how deeply entrenched the patriarchy is.<p>Why isn&#x27;t it racism when someone makes blanket statements about all white people? Because racism isn&#x27;t just discrimination on the basis of race, it&#x27;s discrimination on the basis of race by members of a relatively privileged class against members of a relatively less privileged class. And how do we know what the classes are, and their levels of privilege? Well, feminists will be glad to tell you. But the criteria for deciding may never be revealed, and they certainly wouldn&#x27;t be open for debate.<p>If feminists make statements about, e.g., &quot;men&quot;, and you are a man, and the statement is clearly not true in your case, and not true of your dad, or your granddad, or any of your male friends or male coworkers, you would be wrong to be upset, because they <i>obviously</i> weren&#x27;t talking about you, or them. If you told them that their machine gun seemed to be hitting 90% innocent bystanders, that would be an attempt at derailing.<p>I&#x27;m being a little snarky, and I really don&#x27;t like that. I want to be positive and not add to the noise. But in this case I think it&#x27;s important to try to express how infuriating it is to come in contact with this stuff. It&#x27;s toxic waste. It&#x27;s a mental virus.<p>Needless to say, everything I&#x27;ve said here is invalid, because I&#x27;m a cis white male. It&#x27;s irrelevant how difficult my life has been. I&#x27;m still privileged, and one of the best things I could do would be to shut up [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.blackgirldangerous.org/2014/02/4-ways-push-back-privilege/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackgirldangerous.org/2014/02/4-ways-push-back-p...</a>",1423311357

It was an optionally typed Javascript with compile-time and runtime checking, packages, and namespaces.  It was an absolute pleasure to code with.  I would generally start my prototypes untyped to get something running quickly as a throwaway, and then rewrite strictly typed as I better understood the problem.  I was very happy to ditch Flash years ago, but I would have loved to have AS3 replace Javascript.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript#ActionScript_3.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript#ActionScript_3.0</a>",1423311060

Previously, duplicating a creative work was labour- or resource-intensive, so comparatively few entities could attempt it, and the effort required to police them was small compared to the economic and cultural gain. Now, duplicating a creative work can be done at the twitch of a fingertip, by anybody, anywhere, anytime. As a civilisation we <i>could</i> spend the time and effort to police such things, but I&#x27;m not sure it would be worthwhile.<p>As you point out, it&#x27;s already hard to monetize a low-budget film and it&#x27;s not getting any easier. But that&#x27;s not because people are freeloaders or because they refuse to allocate their resources responsibly (although both may be true). Ultimately, the real problem is that the world changed, and things that had been difficult became easy. We can&#x27;t put the genie of general-purpose computing back in the bottle, and I think it would be irresponsible to lock it down in its current state. The only reasonable alternative is to move forward: this will mean a great economic upheaval for artists, just like the invention of the printing press and recorded music and television were, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a deal-killer. Humans have been creating art, with or without economic recompense, for thousands of years, they&#x27;re not going to stop now.",1423310864

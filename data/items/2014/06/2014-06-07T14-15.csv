So this isn&#x27;t a special advantage of Go at all (it has nothing to do with Go not having type parameters). The only languages that don&#x27;t box in generic collections is C++ and perhaps C# (it doesn&#x27;t have to because of its template-like type parameter semantics, but still might to reduce code duplication).",1402153015

7862194,comment,7860040,7860236,2,0,untilHellbanned,,,"Onarbor differs considerably from other crowdfunding sites.<p>Key concepts and distinctions with existing platforms, crowdfunding or otherwise, include:<p>1. Blockchain:  Onarbor uses Blockchain technology to provide proof of ownership and monetization of digital content in one ledger. This is a pioneering solution in how content creators (including journalists such as yourself!) stake claim for and fund their work. To learn more about this, we note monograph for inspiring us, <a href=""http://www.monegraph.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.monegraph.com</a>.<p>2. Ad-free media: Due to their minuscule fees cryptocurrencies enable a new funding scale, where transactions can be true microfunding (significantly less than $0.01) or huge sums, millions of dollars, all with one button click. Onarbor takes advantage of this to propose an entirely new model of content monetization: instead of ad-supported content as utilized by Youtube, etc., one can pay a one-click, editable amount to instantly view content. Onarbor&#x27;s mission is to abolish ads. Cryptocurrencies make this doable.<p>3. Multi-currency marketplace: That Onarbor allows payments in cryptocurrency and crypto-fiat conversion, e.g., have somebody fund you in Bitcoin and get paid out by Onarbor in USD, makes Onarbor the first marketplace on the internet to do so.<p>4. Collaborators: Kickstarters are presented by one person, whereas most works of merit are collaborations. Onarbor encourages/rewards designating your collaborators, people and organizations, who&#x27;ve contribute to your work. Onarbor is designed to graph onto your existing professional organizational structure where your funding, i.e., salary, and social/professional network are under one roof.<p>5. Reviews and Reputation building: Key to any publisher is having your work reviewed and reputation building. Onarbor enables anyone to review your work and to receive funding if those reviews are judged well by others. Therefore, if you aren&#x27;t a creator but rather someone who can provide analysis, Onarbor can be lucrative and credibility building for you too. Reputation is built by both voting on works and reviews. Our model here is Stackoverflow. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation</a><p>6. Real-time: Unlike Kickstarter, Onarbor allows playback and versioning of all works: documents, videos, music, images, files, and apps. Our model for versioning is Github (though we don&#x27;t use Git because video files are huge). Having a UI which allows editing and playback on the same interface produces a dynamic and considerably easier experience than going back and forth between Kickstarter and Youtube for videos, Kickstarter and Soundcloud for music, etc. Onarbor is a real-time, one-stop shop.<p>7. Distributed: Onarbor is API-driven, which means that the onarbor site, <a href=""https://onarbor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://onarbor.com</a>, is only a simple demo of what people can build with our tools. Our inspiration for this is Facebook, whose developer-first approach led an unprecedented range of products (Pinterest, Spotify, Zynga, etc.) and redefined the concept of a social network. As an ecosystem of creativity, knowledge, and funding, Onarbor aims to redefine the concept of a university.",1402152283

7862192,comment,7861874,7862124,6,0,vidarh,,,"> Google should start over, Android-first (instead of web -first) and make the phone Addressbook / Google Contacts the focal point for everything social. Look at WhatsApp - it does exactly this - your phone number is your ID and your contacts is your social graph; how you interact with them - who you call, message etc and when / where you do it - these are your circles<p>I find this fascinating, as unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding you, you&#x27;re basically suggesting what G+ did to enrage users as described in the article, but seemingly <i>worse</i>:<p>Almost everyone have multiple &quot;personalities&quot;. We don&#x27;t share the same with our grandmother, our friends, our boss, our old class mates, random strangers and so on. This extends all the way to <i>which names we use</i>, how we dress in different situations, who we <i>give our phone number to</i> etc..<p>At first Google seemed to &quot;get&quot; this better than Facebook when they released G+. The moment Nymwars erupted it was clear they did not only not get this, but actively refused to learn.<p>For some this is not about hiding information. For some it is. For some it is a matter of actual <i>survival</i> - whether due to political involvement, or because of threats of revenge or abuse (think people avoiding abusing ex-partners etc.), or because of gender identity etc. (trans people have an incredible high suicide rate due in part to the reactions of wider society; on top of that there&#x27;s actual violent reactions from people). Breaking compartmentalisation puts peoples <i>lives</i> at risk, not just cause embarrassing moments.<p>The <i>first</i> lesson one should learn in social, is that if you wish to create a social network that reflects how people interact, then people need to be able to full compartmentalise what different people see, down to and including your name and who else you are interacting with, and you need to make sure data are not easily leaking between those compartments and that needs to be <i>holy</i>.<p>In that respect, even <i>having</i> a single, unified addressbook / contacts list demonstrates that they don&#x27;t understand (or has purposefully decided not to care about) real social networks (as opposed to the &quot;panopticon&quot; service you decry): It cuts as deep as not revealing all the information on all devices at all times - devices can be shared, or lent out, or someone might just glance at one at the wrong moment. It increases the risk of breaking compartmentalisation accidentally unless users are very tech savvy: Suddenly your device beeps, drawing attention to its screen, just as it displays a message the person sitting next to the device should not have seen.<p>If you&#x27;re lucky / extremely conventional / boring, you laugh it off. If you&#x27;re unlucky, it can cost you your job, your relationships, contact with your family, or your life.<p>Social networks is not just some fluffy web-app thing - it&#x27;s the fabric of society, and they cut deep.",1402152188

7862127,comment,7858317,7861454,1,0,jasode,,,">a classist and strongly capitalist one dividing members of a company into owners and employees.<p>But you don&#x27;t have to divide it as &quot;owners&quot; and &quot;employees&quot;.  The underlying category is the division between those who favor high-risk-uncertain-reward, and those who favor safety-and-salary.  I&#x27;d argue the varied risk profile is rooted in the psychology of economic participants instead of being born of any classism.  The employee that wants to be an owner can be an owner.  The owner that wants to be an employee can be an employee.<p>>An alternative, more progressive position is that all workers should be entitled to some ownership of the fruits of their labour. That is to say, everyone involved in an enterprise, no matter how big or small, is entitled to receive ownership proportional to the impact of their contribution<p>These types of appeals always leave out the other major factor:  owner&#x27;s capital at risk.  We want the workers to get benefits of ownership but never discuss how employees should also bear the same financial risks as the owners. It&#x27;s an incomplete call to action.  The founders/owners are the ones depleting their life savings and maxing out their credit cards to help fund their (sometimes crazy) business idea.  If the business goes bust, is there any realistic discussion of employees giving back their salary to help pay off creditors?  Of course not.  (And rightfully so; the employees took a salary and don&#x27;t want to deal with any of that -- that&#x27;s the owner&#x27;s problem!)  The discussion only talks of employees benefiting from additional upside without taking on any additional downside.<p>If the business was inherited, I can be more aligned with employees sharing more upside.  If Joe Dilettante owns business he got from dad, he could run it into the ground without competent employees keeping things profitable.  However, since this is Hacker News and the &quot;startup&quot; crowd, we&#x27;re usually talking about creating businesses from scratch.<p>> In this world view there is no division between owners and employees,<p>There already is no division. If an employee wants to be an owner, he can do so.  For California, here are the forms:<p><a href=""http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/be/forms.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/be/forms.htm</a><p>Pointing out those forms is not a snark.  I&#x27;m emphasizing that there is no &quot;classism&quot; preventing anyone who happens to be an employee now from becoming an owner tomorrow.  Submit those forms, and go create wealth.  Instead of asking for ownership percentage from other owners, you can simply get the State of California to grant you ownership of your own company.  <i>You give ownership to yourself.</i>  The avenues of ownership are already available to <i>everyone</i>.<p>Is this not in the spirit of the Hacker News demographic or am I reading things wrong?",1402150052

If not, how do I communicate between threads if my application has some kind of shared state? Do I have to pass any messages to the main thread each time, for it to be forwarded to another parallel thread? Does that create a kind of BSP-style point where all the parallel threads stop and the main thread has to synchronise between them? How do you stop this becoming a bottleneck, and how do you load manage if all parallel threads have to stop to allow the main thread to run?",1402149705
7862112,comment,7860213,7861246,2,0,ronaldx,,,"> The ancient ancestor of the first black widow might not have been some peculiar middle ground between benign and lethal, yet the random mutation of offspring which proliferated merely happened to be highly deadly.<p>This is possible but not very likely in reality.<p>We expect evolution to be incremental, for the following reasons:<p>First of all, it&#x27;s very unlikely that any mutation would get to &quot;Surprise! Lethal!&quot; venom unless the species is already geared up to produce something venom-like, and also to store venom and to protect itself from its own venom. There&#x27;s a whole bunch of new functions that are needed to be venomous, and it&#x27;s vanishingly unlikely that they will all suddenly appear at the same time, even at evolutionary scale.<p>IMO mutations normally have small positive effects and large negative effects: they are more likely to delete or - if you&#x27;re lucky - alter some existing function and very unlikely to build a whole new function (compare: a small random change to your computer code).<p>Even if super-lethal venom was to somehow appear overnight, then in order to reach 100% prevalence it must provide such an immediate advantage that the non-lethal spiders die out and only super-lethal spiders proliferate.<p>But the non-lethal spiders were surviving pretty well in order to reach that point. So, there&#x27;s no reason to believe the non-lethal spiders were in particular danger or that lethal venom was needed - normally, the &quot;Surprise! Lethal!&quot; variant line would just quietly die out (as almost all variants do) leaving the wild non-lethal type.<p>As I say, the random mutation explanation is possible but not really practical.<p>A far more plausible scenario is an &quot;arms race&quot; - where venomous functions develop over time, while predators and prey develop immunity over time - as the predators (honey badger) start evolving coping mechanisms, stronger venom is needed.",1402149703

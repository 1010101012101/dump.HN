That being said, the popular press is there to do exactly that; contact your favorite media source and ask that they cover more advances in ""science"". They get paid to do this sort of work for you.""<p>The problem is that the people assigned to cover science for the mainstream press generally don't understand what they are writing about and, I strongly suspect, because they operate under constant deadline pressure they never even read the scientific literature.  They just interview the scientist who did the research and interview another scientist in the field for another perspective and report the most interesting ""sound bites"" from those two interviews along with a bunch of horribly naive (and often flatly wrong) conjectures about what it all means.  You can't really blame them.  They're journalists.  Most of them majored in journalism, English literature, political science, or history in college and probably never took a science course above the 100-level at any time in their entire undergraduate program.  What we need is more Richard Dawkinses, Michio Kakus, and Carl Sagans - academics who take on the task of explaining science to non-scientists.  The way you get that is by creating the funding apparatus to make it happen.  Academics are quite sensitive to the priorities of funding agencies - they rapidly become very interested in research topics for which funding exists.  :)  If funding exists for a professorship focused on enhancing the public understanding of science, there will inevitably be plenty of academics competing to fill that position.",1308703203

If you can't reach some people you want with a HTML5 solution (because their browsers don't support it) then you have to use Flash. If you can't reach some people you want to reach with Flash then you have to use HTML5. If you want to use HTML5 at all you probably have to use a Flash fallback since it's quite often the case that some people you want to reach can't use HTML5.<p>Tradeoffs are always involved and the landscape is changing too slowly to care about anything but current (and not predicted future) usage statistics  in most cases. It always depends on the necessary work and supported features. Ideally you would support both but that's either sometimes not possible or too much work for too little gain.<p>You might not currently want to use canvas but, I think, video has become a pretty obvious case.

Not any time soon, mind you, but eventually.<p>I've been trying to come up with a way to articulate how I think about this whole non-debate and here's a first stab:<p>One of the primary reasons Flash will eventually be unseated is not that Flash is closed -- standards, to a certain extent, are constructed in a relatively closed manner -- but because standards and technologies built on top of standards are more agile.<p>Flash is an awesome platform, but you can only build on that platform. Standards are great because you can combine platforms and build things not explicitly envisioned. Flash's single-platform approach makes it so that it will eventually have to play catch-up to a whole set of features that are being built by mixing and matching standards.<p>CSS3 + Javascript, for instance, can be used without Canvas to build really awesome functionality.<p>Canvas + Javascript can be used to make really engaging content.<p>Flash will eventually have to compete not with another product on features, but an entire web of organic technologies that don't have to wait for other components to advance in order to release the next stable version.",1308701883

Yes, there are certain things that just aren't immediately feasible before you launch, but the goal should be to get basic redundancies online quickly while you're operating.<p>By the time you have 4,000 customers, if you don't have backups for your backups, you're being negligent. And I say that without any malice whatsoever ... my experience with a lot of hosting companies, both big and small, is that Distribute wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary.<p>The thing is, targeting backups isn't new at all. It's been done before, and made the news before; at this point, it's not something that should surprise a sysadmin. i.e., the thought process immediately after setting up your backups should be, ""OK, now what happens if a hacker tries to hit them too?""<p>So, yes, this is armchair quarterbacking, and yes, this is common behavior in the industry. But that still doesn't make it excusable in the least.<p>EDIT: Just to expound a little more on this, the reason I have such a hard-line stance on this is that, as a hosting provider, you are effectively taking responsibility for your customers' data and, in some cases, their livelihood. Yes, ideally, every customer would have their own backups and could move themselves to another host within an hour, but the reality is that it doesn't happen that way. Customers often have websites whose only copy is on your systems, email that's stored only on your systems (because they habitually use webmail, a service that you provide which makes that problem possible). Having ""not our responsibility"" in your TOS is very much not enough; you <i>must</i> be taking every reasonable precaution to safeguard your users' data, and in this case, Distribute -- along with many, many other hosting providers -- was not, because they did not have <i>secured</i> backups.",1308701684

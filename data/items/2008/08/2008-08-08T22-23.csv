271135,comment,270500,270980,0,0,harshavr,,,"This is an interesting example. But to take the question further, exactly what choices do you allow an individual to trade away? As an extreme, will you allow an individual to trade his life away(or as in The Merchant of Venice, one pound of flesh), if it can be used in some way to obtain a better contract from someone else? In the poorer parts of the world, people sometimes sell themselves into slavery.<p>The options here are either A)the extreme position - an individual is free to make any contract whatsoever and is henceforth bound by that contract(the government is the enforcer), or B)there is a set of fundamental freedoms which one can't freely trade away.<p>Are you advocating A or B? If B, one would need to find some basic principles which determine what freedoms can't be given up voluntarily.",1218235736

I just kept my own copies, and made all my changes to those. Anything that had been touched by Frontpage wouldn't get updated, it became a dead branch.<p>I would bring in changes that had happened in Frontpage, but from scratch by hand, not by importing any of Frontpage's code.<p>I also worked on my boss by setting up an internal A/B comparison site, where internal users could choose which page they liked better. They voted on whichever they liked, with no indication to them of which page has hand-coded and which was worked over by automated tools. When I had over 800 votes in less than a week, with 95% voting for the hand-coded pages and _all_ the user comments saying why they preferred them, I was able to get my boss to agree to keep the tools off my hand-written code for all but a couple of pages in the site.<p>I also wrote some scripts to generate new pages that were maintainable where there was a need to create new content on the fly, eliminating one of the big excuses for the Frontpage nukes (""You were out of the office, we had to post, and all they know is Frontpage!"")<p>Good luck!",1218235657

Fun for a while, but fails to capture the imagination.<p>Part of the problem with ""great"" literature or philosophy is that so much of it is written by tortured, depressed people for the tortured and depressed audience.  It was cool to read Nietzsche when I was tortured and depressed in my early 20's, sitting at the Kopi Cafe in Chicago, while chain smoking and pounding triple espresso's.  Right now, I don't really have the time to think about soul-crushing absurdity of life.  I'm too busy trying to found my startup.  Not too many nihilists in Silicon Valley these days.

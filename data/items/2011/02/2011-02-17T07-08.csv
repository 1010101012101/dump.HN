Every completely new technology (and this is truly new) has lots of low hanging fruit to pick which are not obviously at first glance. Jeopardy was a test application and publicity source, but where the real-world applications are, we don't know yet. But it's a safe bet there'll be at least a couple of domains that will be completely revolutionized.<p>2. The great benefits of AI, like those of computing in general, aren't in AI-only applications. We won't have black box factories any time soon, just as we don't have black box financial systems or medical equipment. The benefits come _always_ from the synergy between human and machine.<p>So the argument that Watson isn't a <i>real</i> AI doesn't hold water (true Scotsman anyone?).

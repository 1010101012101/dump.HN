Take a look at the compiled JS code:<p><pre><code>    (function () { &quot;use strict&quot;;\n    var Metric = function() { };\n    Metric.main = function() {\n            var coinRadius = 12;\n            var myHeight = 180;\n            var raceLength = 200;\n            var commuteDistance = 23;\n            Metric.diff(coinRadius / 1000,myHeight / 100);\n            Metric.diff(raceLength,commuteDistance * 1000);\n            Metric.sum(commuteDistance * 1000,coinRadius / 1000);\n    };\n    Metric.diff = function(a,b) {\n            var d = Math.abs(a - b);\n            console.log(&quot;&quot; + d + &quot; meters&quot;);\n    };\n    Metric.sum = function(a,b) {\n            var s = Math.abs(a + b);\n            console.log(&quot;&quot; + s + &quot; meters&quot;);\n    };\n    Metric.main();\n    })();\n</code></pre>\nThe compiler takes care of all the conversions for you.

8221041,comment,8220021,8220021,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"There are a huge number of problems relating to how economists account for technology, this article touches on only one, though along with its related criticisms, it makes a few good points.<p>A bit of background.<p>Adam Smith laid the groundwork for defining GDP in the introductory paragraphs of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, in which he defines &quot;the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of the society.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#link2H_INTR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#link2H...</a><p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s specifically what Simon Kuznets had in mind when he devised GDP, though I don&#x27;t find a mention of it in the first few pages of his &quot;letter&quot; (some 290+ pages long) in which the scope of it is laid out in 1934:<p><a href=""http://search.stlouisfed.org/search?&site=Fraser&output=xml_no_dtd&proxystylesheet=Fraser&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&getfields=%2A&filter=0&client=Fraser&q=19340104_nationalinc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.stlouisfed.org/search?&site=Fraser&output=xml_...</a><p>But if you read that work, you&#x27;ll find that accounting for GDP includes all manner of compromises -- the omission of services from housewives and family members, of the services of owned durable goods, of odd jobs (&quot;under the table&quot;) labor, of charity and relief, of changes in asset value, and of illegal activities (Kuznets was writing one year after the repeal of prohibition -- Al Capone&#x27;s income would have made him a billionaire in current dollars).<p>So missing out on the value of information goods is a fairly modest portion of the economy.  Using my preferred money reference, xkcd&#x27;s excellent &quot;Money&quot; infographic, arts & entertainment and information services <i>combined</i> are still just over $1 billion, of a total economic output of $14.5 billion.  Call it 7%.<p>The more philosophical question gets down to just what &quot;value&quot; and &quot;price&quot; are, and how they&#x27;re related.  This isn&#x27;t a trivial question, a large number of economic texts and papers <i>still</i> begin with this discussion, and it&#x27;s been at the heart of economic thought for well over 2,000 years (see for example, Roger E. Backhouse, <i>The Ordinary Business of Life</i>, which covers, in an exceptionally dry fashion, much of this history).<p>The question of how to value GDP over time isn&#x27;t a trivial one, though I&#x27;ll note that for most of history it&#x27;s actually <i>not</i> particularly much in question:  human outputs and activities were fairly constant, as were occupations, and there was very little long-term growth (a fraction of a percent for most of history).  It&#x27;s the period since the Industrial Revolution that&#x27;s the anomaly, with an accelerating trend through much of the 20th century (some now see that acceleration ending or at the very least slowing, with a divergence of views on what will follow).<p>The other salient question is:  what does all that technology actually get you?  Arnold Toynbee in his <i>Lectures on the Industrial Revolution</i> notes that there are very few universal laws in economics, but that that the law of diminishing returns is certainly central.  And that&#x27;s true of information and computing technology as well.  Man landed on the Moon with computing power you&#x27;d find in a musical greeting card today, while the five computers of the Space Shuttle never left low Earth orbit -- falling short of the earlier mark by nearly a quarter million miles.  Automobile control systems increase fuel efficiency, but it&#x27;s difficult to get beyond about 50 MPG without heroic measures (and that&#x27;s only a doubling of a 25 MPG vehicle&#x27;s efficiency, as it is of a 12 MPG vehicle).<p>Randall Lee Reetz makes a really good argument for this in many of his Google Plus posts and comments, he&#x27;s a prickly bastard, but is spot on in this regard.<p>My conclusion:  GDP is tremendously flawed, information goods are only a small part of its mismeasure.  If you&#x27;re focused there, you&#x27;re missing the forest for the pine needles.<p><a href=""http://xkcd.com/980/huge/#x=-8418&y=-4470&z=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/980/huge/#x=-8418&y=-4470&z=5</a>",1408956501

It&#x27;s a really good way to learn, and to get feedback on your ideas.<p>Hopefully Armin listens to people who have been thinking about this for a long time, and done work in this area. But why should his ideas, which are admittedly uniformed, get spread wider than better ideas? This happens a lot anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s entirely positive when people rant when they don&#x27;t have the knowledge to back it up. However, it can produce a reaction from other people to step up and argue their case better. Or even better, to put out their code. I think in this case Armin does have a bit of a clue, and this essay is informing himself, and others quite well.<p>You can statically check python with types now (pycharm pysonar2 etc), and you can use things like ABCs and interfaces to enforce constraints.<p>&quot;Union types&quot; and &quot;intersection types&quot; are the type systems people have used to statically type check python, and other dynamically typed languages.  You can see the various types coming into or out of a function. This is what Armin is talking about with Option/Composite types.<p>So these various type systems which have been used to add extra type checking on top of python are now being blessed, and brought into the language proper.<p>There are plenty of places in Python where the types are not specified well, because mostly it doesn&#x27;t matter to people using it.  Since the type checking tools have added external type definitions, and fixed up inconsistencies outside of the python implementations.  So Armin is pointing out a few examples of type inconsistencies within python.  There are lots more.  Especially at the C API level, where things are a bit weird.  But they haven&#x27;t really bothered people that much, so they haven&#x27;t been fixed.  As someone who has written C extensions for python, I can tell you that it is weird, and things have changed with every python release (even, and especially in the 2.x series).<p>However, these external type definitions are being brought together into the language (as per Guidos email) in the mypy format. There is a hope that the other definitions from tools like PyCharm can be translated automatically.  These definitions are being used in useful tools <i>today</i>.<p>These external type definitions are in effect a specification of the types for the core language, the standard library, and even other popular libraries (like Django etc).<p>What came first the Duck or the specification of the Duck?",1408955844

The claim is only that there&#x27;s not enough evidence that success is based on effort.<p>There are lots of possible outcomes of this research as to what&#x27;s the origin of success: genes, effort (just not measured correctly yet), pure chance, ...<p>I&#x27;m in the &quot;pure chance&quot; camp (though effort is obviously a necessary condition in most cases), and I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s genes because there are too many outliers.<p>But should it be &quot;genes&quot;, that&#x27;s actually useful knowledge: Why work hard on your dreams, if they&#x27;re _indeed_ impossible to achieve? Individually that must be terribly frustrating, while globally it&#x27;s a waste of resources, and will also lead to &quot;a less prosperous and ambitious society&quot; than what more efficient allocation could achieve. [Edit: I can propose such an outrageous system because I really don&#x27;t believe that genes can do more than optimize _slightly_ in favor or against some aptitude.]<p>IMHO Brave New World shows the downsides of such a (gene-optimizing) society better than Gattaca, because there&#x27;s no need for society to create oppressed castes for doing the menial work like in the latter. Brave New World provides a &quot;smarter&quot; approach.<p>> a less prosperous and ambitious society<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of intrinsic (over extrinsic) motivation, and maybe that&#x27;s why I also prefer cooperation over competition. Extrinsic motivation and competition are two sides of the same coin for me since both hunt scarce resources (where&#x27;s the motivation or the competition, if all you get for your effort is already available in abundance?).<p>With this point of view, my assumption is that a more cooperative society isn&#x27;t &quot;less prosperous&quot;, it just achieves more balance.<p>> The risk is that organizations like government agencies and companies will begin to consider your genes ahead of (or instead of) your ambition and motivation.<p>Genes are a proxy of heritage in a way. That organizations optimize for heritage isn&#x27;t exactly a new phenomenon: SAT mapping parental income more closely than aptitude; IQ tests having cultural differential, probably mapping ancestry; &quot;who you know vs what you know&quot;...<p>All of that is driven (and declared &quot;standard&quot;) by powerful organizations that optimize for not rocking that particular boat.",1408954039

Perhaps they're wrong, but I'm more confident in the predictions of a moderate conservative with solid macroeconomic understanding, like Greg Mankiw, than I am in the predictions of people like Lew Rockwell, who have been consistently wrong for 25 years now with the same, self-serving predictions (<a href=""http://hyperinflatingyet.com/shame.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperinflatingyet.com/shame.html</a>).<p>Maybe <i>this</i> time they're right, even though they were wrong in 1985, 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003, ...; but I doubt it.",1315771146

(Of a 1,000+ employee megacorp.)  When customers/vendors complained about a particular employee's inavailability for their needs, everyone could just say ""Sir, I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do.  It is Company Founding Day.""<p>That costs rounding error next to an employee.

2984626,comment,2984004,2984004,6,0,astrofinch,,,"I'm really glad to see someone discussing the actual mechanics of how they program.  We need more arguing about which mechanics are the best and less arguing about which tools are the best.  I'm sure the top 1% of programmers are the top 1% because of their awesome mechanics, not their awesome tools.<p>In my experience the quality of your debugging facilities determines a lot of how important it is to program by accretion.  If you are getting really high quality tracebacks when there is a bug, it tends to be safer to add a lot of code at a time.<p>For me the Holy Grail has always been for my program to run on the first go without any bugs.  I have achieved this for small Python scripts.  To write conceptually correct code on the first go requires a much higher level of mental engagement, but it is far more satisfying than working by trial and error.  (I guess it is probably all right to have trivial bugs like a forgotten import statement or a misfired library call.)",1315770782

2984620,comment,2982256,2982256,6,0,gruseom,,,"I'll pipe up with one thing nobody seems to be emphasizing. A lot depends on <i>how good</i> Dart turns out to be. Suppose it turns out so good that we get all four of the following:<p><pre><code>  1. No worse a user experience in any browser;\n  2. A much better user experience in Chrome;\n  3. A much better developer experience;\n  4. A much better server-side platform than V8.\n</code></pre>\nIf we get all that, standards or not, I will be jumping for joy. If Dart is that good, it will become standard, either de jure or de facto as alternatives fall by the wayside.<p>Of the four, #1 (a good enough Dart->JS) seems problematic. #2 may be bad for other browser vendors, but if it's good for users and programmers, why should I care? I see no virtue in a lowest common denominator. #3 and #4 are hardly objectionable. Only those who like them need bother.<p>I don't know how likely this win-win-win-win is, but here's why I'm indulging in the hope. These guys have been gods of fast dynamic VMs since Strongtalk. If Dart is their chance to build what they always wanted, but this time with 20 years of experience to draw on and the institutional support of a Google behind them... well, we have the chance of something insanely great. Greatness sets its own standard.<p>Comparisons to VBScript and Flash only kick in if what they come out with is lacklustre.",1315770596

I am not so much defending the way Google is going about it, but rather the value of something which plays the essentially same role.<p>Ideally, I would like the web developer to have as much freedom as a developer for a native application - the freedom to choose a programming language and the ability to compile to a reasonably low level target for performance while still being cross-platform. Now, this somehow needs to be done without the security nightmares of ActiveX plugins. (Though, I dont see the non-security problems with a bunch of shared libraries stored on the browser. This is essentially what the OS does, and my goal is to replace the OS with the browser. Bandwidth will probably improve so that downloading libraries shouldn't be a problem and if not, the web site maintainer can still choose not to develop in a large library environment  The popular ones will be cached in any case.)<p>You seem to be saying that the technical difficulties of doing this in a well-specified (memory and control-flow), secure and cross-platform way are intractable.

These are things that are important to be good at but not worth the time to be excellent at.  To say it's a waste of time to be in the top 10% is nonsense.<p>Take driving for example.  When I started driving I enrolled in a driving course for several months.  Now it's debatable that this course put me in the top 10% but it probably helped to put me above average.  I have no ambition to be a race-car or stunt car driver so this is a great trade-off.  I believe I'm a safer driver because of it.<p>Negotiating would be another example.  It would make a lot of sense for a lot of people to take a negotiating course or read and practice it for a few months to get good at it in order to be able to negotiate their salary.  The payoff of just a few months work could result in tens of thousands of dollars over your whole career.  It wouldn't really be beneficial to spend 5-10 years getting your negotiating skills to the top 1% unless you wanted to actually do that for work.<p>Also the 10,000 hours really depends on if you are actually progressing or not.  I think it's pretty debatable whether merely 10,000 hours of driving would put you in the top 1%.  It's like the old joke that some people with 20 years of experience actually have one year of experience repeated 20 times.<p>Yes, you can't be great at everything but I think it's more valuable to great at one thing and good at a lot of things rather than just great at one or two things and mediocre at everything else.<p>Basically my point is, strive to be in the top 1% for what you want to earn money at or do with your life and then be in the top 10% for other things that either help you with that or benefit you in some way.",1315770041

If, for example, the network goes down for 1 hour, development grinds to a halt. The reason here is that TFS will mark all files as read-only on the filesystem until you have asked the server to check them out for you.<p>Perforce works the same way, causing much frustration for me whenever I have to work with a slow and unreliable p4 server (and, despite Perforce marketing, those exist). You can override p4 and make writable the files you want to edit without telling the server. But when you want to check in a changeset, you have to tell the server you edited the files, otherwise they will get left out of the changeset.  Worse yet, if you try to get too clever with your local copy's settings, the p4 utility might overwrite your changes with a newly checked-in version the next time you update your local copy.<p>When I worked at Microsoft in the early part of the last decade, we used a Perforce fork called Source Depot.

It would be interesting to know more. Is this a fixed 25 day cut off then, or is it prorated? Kind of alarming is the part where the monthly salary as an example is 100, surely he meant to type 3000?<p>It sounds like you might work there? If so I have a couple questions for clarification, in addition to (1) clearing up that the 100 thing was just a random number and not representative (since some Chinese developers do make in that range, so it's not an impossible salary to claim). (2) Did ""Whats normal for time off varies from country to country"" mean that US employees of the company (for example) are expected to use less days than european ones? That the cut off for what is considered ""unreasonable use"" differs depending on company. (3) If the answer to that is yes, then are salaries matched to standard market rate in the economy each employee lives in? Are SF based employees paid 20 times as much as the guy in Bangladesh for the same work? (4) With a worldwide workforce, how does the company handle paying social insurance tax and providing for benefits in each country? Are competitive insurance plans offered, a different one for each employee? Or is there some insurance company that is able to provide insurance for all employees regardless of what country they are citizens of and resident in?

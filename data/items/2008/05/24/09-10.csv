198695,comment,198631,198631,0,0,elad,,,"Search has made gazillions for Google because it captures purchase intent, which they translate into the best possible (for now at least) targeted advertising.\nSo if you're in search it'd make sense to try the same strategy (if it ain't broken, and it sure ain't, don't fix it). It doesn't have to be advertising, but it has to have something to do with purchase intent, helping people find what they're looking to buy, and monetizing that somehow.\nHere's an idea - what if I'm looking for a particular product on ebay, but my purchase decision really depends on how the product looks. Maybe it's some object of art. Maybe etsy would be a better example than ebay. I don't know what you're technology is like so it's hard to tell.\nIn any case, I'd look at riya.com - are they your competitors?",1211621332

My first impression, though, is that the interface is too mouse heavy (admittedly my main complaint about everything that requires the mouse).

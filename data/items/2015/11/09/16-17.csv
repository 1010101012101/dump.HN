Films don&#x27;t have perfect reciprocity characteristics (1/2 the exposure doesn&#x27;t necessarily yield 1/2 the negative density, but digital sensors essentially count photons and obey the reciprocity law quite well), nor does slide film have the dynamic range of digital sensors, so the look tends to be different.  I was recently taking some pictures around town with Velvia 50 and immediately thought &quot;wow, this looks like it was taken in 1990&quot;.  It really does give a distinct look.  The sky gives it away: <a href=""https://goo.gl/photos/ciawuX28bbBhnehc7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/photos/ciawuX28bbBhnehc7</a><p>There are also other characteristics that come into play.  With digital sensors, you&#x27;re capturing colors as seen by the color matrix on top of the sensor; Nikon, Canon, and Sony make these differently.  With film, you&#x27;re physically activating dye, and the dyes are also chosen uniquely for each film.  So the colors can end up looking different, both because of process difference and intentional changes of the color.  (Velvia 50 does not provide what one would call accurate color, but the inaccuracy is quite pleasing.  The same goes for the Kodachrome/Ektachrome which were very popular in their times.)",1447087855

Buy lemonade, hiking maps, souvenir magnets, and postcards from the kiosk.  10%-off coupons for checking in on social media.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey mister; hey lady!  You wanna buy Hollywood Sign t-shirt?  Hollywood Sign keychain fob?  How about shopped photo with your name in place of the real sign?  Don&#x27;t just take selfies!  Everybody takes selfies!  Buy something no one else has; buy this volume-printed diorama of the sign and surrounding park, signed by the artist!  Limited edition!<p>Whenever I have been a tourist, the single best way to make me want to leave and never return is to subject me to a continuous barrage of sales pitches for useless attraction-related crap.  Example: every square centimeter of Disney World.  That&#x27;s like the ultimate goal of merchandising, when it all sort of collapses into this state where everything becomes an advertisement for itself, and everything you buy subtly encourages you to buy more, or maybe just put all your cash in a paper envelope and deposit it into a slot under the Walt and Mickey statue.<p>That&#x27;s how you ruin an attraction.  You don&#x27;t just make it secret and exclusive; that only makes people want it more.  Instead, you relentlessly try to squeeze every last drop of money out of it.  If you really want the people to stop coming, your Holy Grail is the online review that says, &quot;Not worth the $10 parking space in some guy&#x27;s front yard.  Locals aggressively sell touristy crap, and the sign itself seems kind of cheap and pathetic from up close.&quot;<p>Of course, the downside is that unless you have some sort of &quot;identify friend or foe&quot; system in place, you get a dozen sales pitches every time you walk from your own driveway to your own house.",1447087260

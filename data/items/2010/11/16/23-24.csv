It is also preferred that Bayes be spelled in caps. Just for arguments sake, let us assume that an Arab lookalike is more likely to blow up a plane. (digression: I also amuse myself by trying to look like one before flying, at least to the TSO.)<p>The short answer to the source of the misunderstanding is that one usually forgets to take into account that there are far less Arab lookalikes than non Arab lookalikes. A common mistake is to go with the conditional probability rather than the posterior.<p>The probability that an Arab is a terrorist, strictly speaking, the empirical <i>conditional</i> <i>probability</i> is the number of Arab with an intent to blow up the plane divided by the total number of Arab in the population under consideration. For arguments sake let me agree with you that this is higher than the corresponding <i>conditional</i> <i>probability</i> for a non-Arab. Lets represent these quantities by <i>pa</i> and <i>pb</i> respectively.<p>The likelihood ratio that an Arab lookalike will blow up a plane is then\n   (pa * Pa) / (pb * Pb)\nwhere Pa and Pb are the probabilities that a random sample from the population is an Arab vs non-Arab. What are known as the <i>priors</i>. Here we have <i>Pb</i> >> <i>Pa</i>.<p>In order to justify that Arabs be selectively screened it is necessary that<p><pre><code>   pa > ( pb * Pb )/(Pa). \n</code></pre>\nThis becomes equivalent to the condition \n   pa > pb\nwhen <i>Pb</i> = <i>Pa</i>.<p>So I suspect that if anyone is\n   sticking fingers in your ears and shouting loudly ""can't hear you!"".\nisnt quite, as you put it, ""The US"".<p>There are other issues:<p>It is hard to argue that <i>pa</i> is indeed greater than <i>pb</i>, i.e. for random samples of equal size there would be more terrorists in the Arab sample than not. Its quite a radical statement and justifications should have been mandatory.<p>Also I disagree with your assertion that ""Had the world evolved differently,..."" things would have been different. My counterexample is that the Irish or the Catholics in US were not subjected to any of this on flights to Britain when the IRA were bombing away innocent civilians there. BTW this is not the only counterexample.(I also suspect that O'reilly's over the top assertion that terrorist = Muslim is a compensatory mechanism, conscious or unconscious I do not know.)<p>The logical explanation for the way the security response is playing out in the field of travel seems to be that people are afraid of unfamiliar people and all it takes to tone down that fear is just some superficial familiarity (such as skin tone).<p>So I am hopeful that this stage too will pass.

If you seriously gouge a guy's eyes but don't win the fight, his objective might change from beating you down to seriously hurting you in retaliation for your transgression.  In a ""social"" fight where a guy thinks he is restoring his slighted masculinity or enforcing his idea of the proper order of the universe, I would think the better odds offered by fighting dirty would be outweighed by the possibly much worse outcome if you lose.

I say that as a nerd who got beat up and pushed around a lot in elementary up through high school. Once I could afford it I made it a point to study self defense, not so that I could fight, but so I at least had the confidence to know how to handle myself.<p>Learning to fight for its own sake is dumb if your plan is to do it outside of a structured sporting event. Keep in mind I don't mean self defense. Most people won't get into a fight unless they feel extremely confident about winning. That could mean they are much bigger, well trained, armed, have lots of friends, etc. If you don't know how to defend yourself, you probably won't figure it out in the time it takes someone to punch you. The best defense is to know when to get out.<p>Just had a big confrontation with someone at a bar? The time to leave is NOW (before he comes back with friends, a bottle to the back of the head, finds you stumbling out drunk, etc). During that confrontation? Keep your hands up and the other person away from you - pretty much the same stance as if you were going to throw a punch but with your hands open. Don't turn your back to someone who is aggressive - back away slowly.<p>If worse comes to worse you won't remember any techniques you read here or elsewhere unless you've practiced them A LOT. Just try and remember that while there are no rules you shouldn't try to escalate a fight any more than you need to in order to get away. What I mean by this is if someone shoves you, just walk away. IF you throw a punch then they throw a punch, etc. You hit a guy and he goes down? Great, now leave. Start kicking him now and maybe his 2 or 3 friends decide it's a good time to jump in instead of helping their friend up. Don't escalate a situation unnecessarily.<p>If you want more than this - go take Krav Maga classes for a year or two - then you'll at least (hopefully) be able to throw a decent punch without hurting yourself.",1289948734

Purely applicative programs can do nothing. The question is not whether the state of the world is modified, but how it is modified and if those modifications should be somehow segregated from other parts of the program.</i><p>We probably misunderstood each other, because I completely agree with that point. Now my point is that effect aren't segregated well enough. And that anyone who knows FP will have a better grasp of state, and will be able to segregate it more properly. I'm not against mutability.  I'm against pervasive, rampant, unsegregated mutability, which I see way too much at work.<p>About your good reasons… I'd say reason 1, while still important, is invoked too often. It looks to me like premature optimization justify the use of verbose, unsafe, but familiar, techniques and languages. Reason 2 is basically the lack of teaching I was talking about. I don't know how to fix it, I just believe it should be. I partly deny reason 3. Command and control is of course best expressed with imperative programming, but no problem I saw is limited to that.  Most problems have huge ""pure"" chunks, which are easily expressed applicatively. And in the large… I think modules developed by different teams should have explicit and small interfaces (if only to reduce communication overhead). Making those interfaces functionally pure where possible looks like the easiest way to achieve that. (Note that imperative inner cores don't bother me much, as long as the outer shells are kept pure.)<p>Apparently, I haven't read Dijkstra enough.

I crawl the web looking for mp3 blogs then I index the mp3 blogs frequently. I currently do a bunch of keyword analysis using the wordnet (<a href=""http://wordnet.princeton.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordnet.princeton.edu</a>) library. I would like to do some more advanced analysis like theme recognition or unique feature extraction. I have read the book ""programming for collective intelligence"", its a great start, but I wondered if their are any libraries out their that do this already? <p>* Python preferable, but I'll take what I can get.",1197105760

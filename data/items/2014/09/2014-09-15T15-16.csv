My team just got done building a large site with AngularJS, and using MongoDB (or any document store) allowed us an easy way of saving denormalized JSON documents. If you have a JSON object that contains an array of other objects, and each of those objects has arrays of other data, so you have a complex document that is 4 dimensions deep, with MongoDB (or any other document store) you simply put the document in the document store, but with MySQL or PostGre you would break that document up and store it in normal form, which means breaking it up into at least 4 database tables, maybe more. That is a lot more work and, crucially, that is much more likely to be impossible to automate. The code can not automatically know what deeply nested array of objects maps to some database table. The requirements for automatic normalization go beyond the features of your normal ORM.<p>There has been an explosion of these systems lately that automate the synchronization of frontend and backend. As far as I know, they all rely on document stores such as MongoDB.",1410796651

8319511,comment,8315996,8319459,3,0,jerf,,,"In a nutshell, map, reduce, filter, and function composition are all generic functions, in exactly the sense of generic that Go doesn&#x27;t have. Lacking all those things, trying to do FP in it is a waste of time. Lacking this foundation, most higher-level FP stuff is also a waste of time, unless there is some other path to it. Even if Go some day picks up generics and gets map, reduce, and filter, my guess is that function composition will never be something you can do in Go.<p>Note that it <i>does</i> have closures, and makes heavy use of them. It just managed to pick up closures without picking up the rest of FP.<p>I think this generally fits into the spirit of Go being a <i>really good</i> language for working in a larger development environment, where you can&#x27;t expect everyone to be expert FP programmers. And, honestly, an intermediate FP programmer is sorta dangerous to your source code, in much the same way an intermediate OO guy is. Go does a surprisingly good job of preventing the intermediate guy from messing up your code too much.<p>To expand on what I said about the principles of FP being helpful to me in Go even so, here&#x27;s an example: <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2923"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2923</a> In theory, there&#x27;s nothing that <i>prevents</i> another OO language from doing that, but without the structural polymorphism that Go has with its interfaces it&#x27;s so much less convenient that nobody does it, and, more importantly, <i>nobody thinks that way</i>.<p>In fact, in some sense I&#x27;d say Go is inspired by CSP, but to the extent that CSP involves the creation of these complicated networks of data flowing around, it doesn&#x27;t really do that. On the other hand, I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s a very practical way to program... complicated networks just become one more source of &quot;magic&quot; in a program.

We did achieved our goals, but the owner gave me just $5K and kept the rest for himself (he even screwed up his own bother). It&#x27;s my mistake, of course, but that&#x27;s not what I want to talk about here. I&#x27;ve started to accumulate a lot of credit card debt. Not because I was spending a lot (although having a family means paying health insurance, rent, etc. - all adding up to a pretty significant amount, which ate up my savings at the moment), but because my APR went up to well over 30% on all credit cards. I was paying over $5K a month at some point and my balance was ever increasing. I tried talking to the banks, nobody was willing to adjust, of course. I&#x27;ve never had a missed payment in my life till then. At one point, I went to talk to a friend, a very prominent VC in Southern California. He told me: &quot;You&#x27;re crazy! These credit cards are crooks! What they are doing should be illegal. Stop paying - it&#x27;s the only way to grab their attention and negotiate!&quot; So, I listened to him, didn&#x27;t make a payment for over 6 months, then I settled on 50% of the balance and it that was the end of that chapter of my life. My point is, sometimes it&#x27;s the banks to be blamed. If they&#x27;ve kept my below 10% APR, all would have been fun for everyone. At the end of the they after the settlement, they made the same money, but they put me and my family under so much stress, and some sent me tax documents for the difference between the balance and the settlement that was taxable income! I.e. money I&#x27;ve never actually got, I had to pay income tax on it! It&#x27;s a big scheme, I just don&#x27;t how banks get around.

First it says that people overreact to the things that Fish says or does because he&#x27;s famous, but then it goes into how he isn&#x27;t really famous in terms of traditional fame.

Prohibiting the Tor browser would be a bad move on the part of any ISP who isn&#x27;t part of a police state, but none of their document suggest that they&#x27;re doing that. I can understand them prohibiting running a Tor node on your residential internet connection though. Almost all residential ISPs officially prohibit running servers, though it usually isn&#x27;t enforced as long as you aren&#x27;t pushing too much traffic. A Tor node can easily fall on those lines.

8319337,comment,8314766,8318719,1,0,optymizer,,,"Here&#x27;s my (very ignorant) take on it:<p>Having worked through half of the Nature of Code book and implemented all of its physics examples, I realized that the physics libraries are all approximations (not simulations) of the real world. To make the approximations as close as possible to what we see in the real world, you need to make many more fine calculations. This limits the frame rate at which the simulation can run. You either run your simulation less accurately at 30 updates-per-second, or you run it with increased accuracy at 10 updates-per-second. When demo-ing physics libraries, authors usually want to showcase the small details that increase realism. This leads to more calculations, which leads to a greater slowdown.<p>I think gravity is the first force we notice when it&#x27;s off, because we&#x27;re very used to seeing objects fall. For gravity to feel right, it needs to <i>feel</i> like 9.8N/kg at a specific framerate. If you update less often, you&#x27;ll slow down the world. If you update much faster, objects will fall faster. You might want to increase the value of gravity to 19.6N/kg if your fps is 50% slower to maintain the illusion of the real speed, but that effectively means that objects will skip ahead 19.6 units instead of just 9.8units, and that affects collision accuracy. There are a lot of parameters like this that can be tweaked, but since many results are then used as inputs to other calculations, changing one parameter affects the entire simulation. Once you reach a certain level of realism, you don&#x27;t want to adjust those parameters again for a different rate of updates-per-second.<p>In theory. this shouldn&#x27;t happen if you run your physics library as a state machine that takes time as input, and outputs the state of the system into your renderer. This should let your physics simulation run at 30 updates per second, and your graphics rendering at 60fps. In practice, they&#x27;re all running on the same machine, along with any video capturing, and are competing for resources. This leads to slow-downs, which you notice as slow-motions.<p>If anyone can explain this better, please do chime in.",1410793654

It amazes me how many coders flip out at the suggestion of teaching/advocating regexes to novices, as if the first thing a novice will attempt to do is parse HTML with regex or build a credit card validation application.<p>I&#x27;ve spent most of my life in the journalism world, and I imagine parts of it, especially the investigative projects time, share some characteristics with the law world...in that you&#x27;re dealing with messy documents and data. You would not f--king believe how much time is wasted on manually reading lists of names/addresses, because the person has no idea how to split &quot;Smith, Bob -- 1020 Broadway, NY&quot; into a spreadsheet. Nevermind the countless hours spent hand fixing whitespace or other formatting errors, things that could take seconds with even just Sublime Text.<p>Regexes are amazing because they teach people how to think in patterns, and that manually defining the pattern for your specific domain can be a very powerful thing. I&#x27;ve greatly increased the speed that I can research things across large document sets...simply by grepping documents for patterns that fit proper nouns, or even large money values (for example, /(?:\\d{3},){2,}/)...when dealing with messily OCR&#x27;ed documents, in which phrases/words will have common mistranslations, being able to grep in order to find a key name/number/noun is incredibly powerful.<p>IMO, regex is exactly the first thing you should be teaching people like lawyers and researchers. It&#x27;s a very powerful programming concept, but besides that, it is immediately useful to anyone who can use a text editor. And it opens the door to programming in general (because find-and-replace with a text editor gets old, you&#x27;ll soon find the need to run grep from the CLI)",1410793519

Because I had been covered under his social security plan when I was a minor and had battled cancer into adulthood (resulting in a $400,000 bill), the remaining debt of nearly $100,000 ended up in my lap. The only way I found out was when my wages began to be garnished. It turned out that a judgement was entered against me in his state, not in mine, and I never got any notice of a court date. Of course, I couldn&#x27;t show up if I didn&#x27;t know about it (I didn&#x27;t even learn of his death until months after, he had been out of my life for many years) so a default judgement was entered. The other state&#x27;s court system somehow didn&#x27;t have my home address but knew where I worked and how to garnish my paycheck.<p>After speaking with a lawyer about it, I was told it would have ended up costing me tens of thousands of dollars and years of court battles with no guarantee of resolution.

Just like child support did with me.<p>Look, I have no problem with people paying what they owe, as long as they can pay it, of course. But with this many people getting wages garnished, and the collections agencies getting more and more draconian? The social balance is off. We&#x27;re making it so if you run a credit agency and lend out money, you&#x27;re guaranteed something back. Aside from who&#x27;s responsible for what, that&#x27;s not the way we want the economy to work.",1410793211

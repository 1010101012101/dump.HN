Apple makes great products.<p>(How does that relate to Apple fans being crazy? The underlying idea is that if a company’s products are attractive for many people – for whatever reason – there are bound to be at least a few crazies among those who find the product attractive [0]. See also: Star Wars, Harry Potter, Wii, Justin Bieber.)<p>Any ideas on how to empirically test that? I can only think of two right now but there have to be more:<p>1. How often and for how long are Apple products actually used after they are bought and how does that compare to other, similar products?<p>2. How do objective metrics for product quality compare to similar products? (That’s extremely tricky. What matters more and what less? What’s objective? What about all that subjective stuff?)<p>[0] I think it is rather obvious that not all Apple “fans” are also crazy enough to stand in line for hours. Apple sold 16 million iPads during the last year and only a tiny minority of those 16 million iPads were bought by people who are crazy enough to stand in line for, say, more than two hours. Most Apple customers are very likely neither fans nor crazy.",1301118418

2371444,comment,2371007,2371290,7,0,pjscott,,,"A lot of students would not respond well to that kind of approach. It's too much at once; you're trying to teach them to think like an idiot savant computer, <i>and</i> teach them common patterns for translating their thoughts into code, <i>and</i> hit them with a bunch of low-level details about pointers and stacks and instructions? Some exceptional students would thrive. Others would dig in and do sort of okay, passing the test and then maybe learning it properly later on. Many -- maybe most -- would just get discouraged and switch majors to something where they'll never have to deal with null pointers or case fall-through or (god help us) malloc alignment along dword boundaries.<p>If you want to do it that way, you've got to take one thing at a time. Colin's idea of starting with assembly language isn't nearly as crazy as it sounds; I know several people who learned that way. Personally, I would start with very simple, linear programs in a high-level language like Python. Let them get a feel for it, and fiddle around. Then gradually start introducing more and more difficult concepts, like if statements, or looping, and how to use these strange new wonders. Later -- much later -- you'll be able to talk about the low-level details exposed by a language like C. If you try it too early, you'll either get head-explosions or blank stares.<p>(Incidentally, head explosions are preferable. One of the greatest horrors of teaching is that there will always be students who stare at you with looks of blank incomprehension, and it always might be your fault.)",1301117847

Therefore, because that unlikely event occurred, everyone is off the hook for structural flaws that could have hastened any subsequent meltdown and breach.

2371411,comment,2371243,2371243,4,0,nopal,,,"I think the average Apple fan has shifted in the past few years. I've been using Macs for a while (steady since the G3 was into'ed), and I can definitely say that there're a lot more en vogue now than they were in the past. Given that, it's harder to pinpoint why so many people line up for an iPad (simply given that there are so many more people in the demographic in question).<p>Speaking to the ""old"" Apple fan, I think that there's a sense of loyalty and a sense of being on the cutting edge.<p>As I said, I've been using Apple products exclusively (at home) since '99, and I've grown to feel a sense of attachment to the company. Something about Apple products clicked with me, and I felt the desire to foster a niche provider. This feeling is, I'm sure, compounded by the fact that I felt I was ""in"" on something and wanted to be even more in by adopting the latest and greatest.<p>I remember saying, ""My voice is my password"" over and over to no avail after Steve demoed voice passwords in a version of OS 9 that I promptly purchased. It didn't matter that it didn't work; Steve had shown what it was supposed to be, and I bought in. Even while I was dealing with a faulty product, I still felt like I was part of something great, and at its heart, the feature was cool and innovative, even if the implementation fell far short.<p>Those are the reasons I feel so much a part of the Mac world, but I guess the author is asking about why Apple clicks with people. That answer's far more complex, and one I definitely can't answer in a general sense. If I think back to when I really jumped on the bandwagon, I'd have to say that I was impressed by Apple's way of doing things differently, focusing on the best and focusing on the consumer.<p>Apple definitely did things differently than MS in the late 90s and early 2000s, and to me, their differences felt more focused on what I wanted to do. I wanted an easy way to get on the internet, and I wanted an un-compex system for managing my stuff. Apple felt like they wanted to make these things easy for me. And as far as focusing on the best, it seemed like Apple was striving for the best, most of the time. I remember my Apple monitor having a premium Mitsubishi tube in it, and the G3 being a hell of a processor. Maybe there were better components on the market, but Apple tried to put together a really nice package, and I liked it. Since then, I've become a professional programmer, and I question whether I would have liked Apple if I was looking for a development platform back then. I honestly don't know, but I do know that their decision to embrace Unix at the core of their OS has served them well within the more technical community.<p>So I guess the bottom line is that Apple provides a different experience, and for those of us that buy into it, it's worth a little sacrifice to get to be the first and to ensure that Apple will live to see another day. That wasn't always as sure a thing as it is now.<p>And if you're looking for an answer to why the cool people want to be the first with an iPad 2 and a leather Smart Cover, look elsewhere.",1301116412

I fully expect the Wattvision to pay for itself in about a year based on what I've seen in the 3ish weeks I've had it (our latest power bill was almost $20 off from last year for about the same average temperature).<p>I thought we were a pretty energy conservative-household, but seeing the immediate effects that certain appliances and lights have on our consumption has changed how Mom, Dad and all the kids (even our 7 year old) use electricity. We know which light banks cost the most to use and when we leave everyone makes sure to check lights and shut down everything else we don't need.<p>Also, you can see live data for free. If you don't see the value in API and alerts, don't do the monthly payment options.<p>The original setup was actually far easier than I posted. When I first installed it, I had tucked the <i>entire device</i> into my phone utility box and had zero wires going inside the house. I reconsidered that plan after deciding that the box might get too hot in the summer. Fortunately I found some existing cabling and my OCD genes kicked in when I realized I could bring the gateway device inside with all my other blinking lights.<p>I expect most folks will simply run the (exorbitantly long) cable from the sensor through a window or other existing conduit.

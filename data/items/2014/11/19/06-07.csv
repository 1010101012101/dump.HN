8628644,comment,8627930,8628617,0,0,jacalata,,,"Sure, I forgot the non-escort bit - although as you say, it is definitely about sexual attraction. However the defining point I made was that ManServants is explicitly joining that market of sexual market value, but Uber is adding that service to their existing commodity service which did not express interest in it. I consider it unnecessarily sexual to do the latter, but not the former.I consider it misogynist because they have looked at a large mixed gender audience and decided to cater to the sexual desires of the men in it. If you can point out the existing mixed gender non sexual audience that ManServants has started pushing their product on, I might consider it comparable.",1416380383
8628643,comment,8625145,8627520,0,0,schoen,,,"That&#x27;s incredibly disturbing.  I guess a lot of the criminal justice system has a bedrock, usually unstated, assumption that people <i>know what they did and didn&#x27;t do</i>.  That assumption is already questionable some of the time, but I suppose falls apart further when evidence can be fabricated to an extent that makes defendants doubt their sanity.<p>I wonder if this will occur more frequently in an era when people can start to create highly realistic video that appears to be of a particular person performing a particular act (so someone can show you full-blown &quot;surveillance camera footage&quot; of you doing something that you didn&#x27;t do).",1416380361

Soon (Intel Skylake in 2015) there will be AVX512, 512-bits wide registers with byte level processing instructions. Being able to process 64 bytes in one instruction, with ILP [1] potential of two instructions per clock cycle or more, can provide an order of magnitude performance advantage.<p>You can also optimize away unnecessary code for that particular search. No need to have those ignore case, etc. flags. Or for example you could to not include Unicode related logic, if you know ahead of time that normalization etc. won&#x27;t be necessary for this particular text search case. This can have particularly high savings if you&#x27;re branch predictor buffer limited already, by reducing the number of branches [2].<p>If the memory access patterns are not sequential (= predictable by the CPU), you could insert prefetch instructions at CPU model appropriate places to ensure data is going to be in L1 cache in time before use.<p>If you know the data is going to be searched only once, you could give a hint to the CPU that you&#x27;re streaming the data. CPU then can optimize memory access patterns and minimize L1/L2 cache evictions, because it knows this data should not be stored in cache. In other words, non-temporal (= streaming) memory loads and stores. Like <a href=""http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/MOVNTDQA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/MOVNTDQA.html</a>.<p>You could do profile guided optimization at runtime. Or just try random variations and pick the fastest for that particular combination of parameters and hardware without recompiling anything. Different CPU models have a lot of variation [3].<p>And a lot of other things. If the data sets are large, ability to adapt to a particular problem at runtime can have a huge payoff.<p>[1]: Instruction level parallelism.<p>[2]: A branch can mean if-statements, ?-ternary operator, boolean logic (&quot;||&quot;, &quot;&&&quot; etc.), switch statements, and so on. Every branch in currently executing loop can potentially need an entry in the CPU branch predictor. If branch predictor buffer entries run out, this might cause CPU to mispredict that branch every time. The cost of a mispredicted branch is very high. On Intel Ivy Bridge processor, a single branch misprediction costs 14 clock cycles or the time to theoretically execute up to 4*14=56 instructions, practically about 15-30!\nSlightly related links, LLVM CPU scheduler definitions:<p><a href=""http://llvm.org/klaus/llvm/blob/release_33/lib/Target/X86/X86SchedSandyBridge.td"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/klaus/llvm/blob/release_33/lib/Target/X86/X8...</a><p><a href=""http://llvm.org/klaus/llvm/blob/release_33/lib/Target/X86/X86SchedHaswell.td"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/klaus/llvm/blob/release_33/lib/Target/X86/X8...</a><p>[3]: About CPU model variation, see for example this: <a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=285"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=285</a>",1416379382

If it fails, it gives a type e, if it succeeds a type a<p><pre><code>    Promise e a\n</code></pre>\nNow, `then` operates on the successful result, transforming it into a new promise of a different kind. The result is a total promise of the new kind<p><pre><code>    then :: Promise e a -> (a -> Promise e b) -> Promise e b\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll contest now that this is sufficient. Here&#x27;s what you appear to lose:<p><pre><code>    1. No differentiation of error types\n    2. No explicit annotation of the ability to \n       return constant/non-promise values\n    3. No tied-in error handling\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s fine, though. First, for (1), we&#x27;ll note that it ought to be easy to provide an error-mapping function. This is just a continuation which gets applied to errors upon generation (if they occur)<p><pre><code>    mapError :: (e -> e&#x27;) -> Promise e a -> Promise e&#x27; a\n</code></pre>\nFor (2) we&#x27;ll note that it&#x27;s always possible to turn a non-promised value into a promise by returning it immediately<p><pre><code>    pure :: a -> Promise e a\n</code></pre>\nThen for (3), we can build in error catching continuations<p><pre><code>    catch :: Promise e a -> (e -> Promise e&#x27; a) -> Promise e a\n</code></pre>\nWe appear to lose the ability to change the result type of the promise upon catching an error, but we can regain that by pre-composition with `then`.<p>So, each of these smaller types is now very nice to work with. They are equivalent in power to the fully-loaded `then` you gave, but their use is much more compartmentalized. This is how you avoid frightful types.",1416378713

A simple heat diffusion model should also let you estimate internal temperature, if you assume the slice is thin relative to diameter. Note that the convection and radiant heat flows from the pan won&#x27;t change as the food cooks (only from the top of the food)... At the beginning (assuming a heated pan) heat flow into the food will dominate and near the end I expect evaporation will change.<p>You should also be able to do a better job with onions and things you want to cook slowly,because you will see a rapid drop in thermal flow as moisture levels drop... Note, also that boiling evaporation doesn&#x27;t depend strongly on temperature. Cooking a proper roux could likely also be made more simple,if you knew when to pay close attention.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like a rice cooker. Those can actually be VERY smart.",1416378135

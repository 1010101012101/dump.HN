It is  probably impossible to solve cleanly without hard tradeoffs, whether in a society (do we let people shout fire?  consensus versus majority vote?  one vote per share or one vote per person?) or in a computer project (do we sanction bad editors?

1255722,comment,1253490,1254149,0,0,kelnos,,,"I don't disagree with any of your points in a fundamental sense: sure, Apple is well within their rights to set the policies they have set, and I understand that Apple <i>believes</i> that all this gives them a distinct market advantage (I won't try to pass judgment on whether or not that's correct; I don't think anyone here knows for a fact whether they'd be better off another way).<p>Development for a mobile device is different.  If you were developing a Windows application, you'd be expected to own a Windows system.  If you're developing a MacOS X application, you'd be expected to own a system that runs MacOS X.<p>But what about an iPhone application?  By the above logic, you should only be expected to own an iPhone.  Now, this analogy breaks down a bit, because I wouldn't expect anyone to actually develop a serious piece of software directly on an iPhone (at least not without an external monitor, mouse, and keyboard).  So you need another platform to do your development on.  Apple is requiring you to buy a Mac.  Clearly they have development tools that work on Windows, otherwise Win Safari wouldn't be possible.  A port of the iPhone SDK to Windows (or Linux, or whatever) is certainly not out of the question... it's just a matter of throwing resources and time at it.  Now, again, I can certainly believe that Apple would think that restricting iPhone development to Macs is in their best interest, but it's ludicrous to suggest that this decision is also in their developers' best interests.  I think <i>that's</i> what a lot of people are pissed off about.<p>Go to another mobile platform?  Sure, you can do that, but then you're restricting your market.  Yes, there are quite a few other lucrative mobile platforms (several of which have greater market share than the iPhone), but, as a developer, you end up with the unfortunate choice of having to either not develop for the iPhone, or buy an expensive piece of hardware that you only use for iPhone development.  And by ""expensive"" I don't just mean the price tag.  I also mean costs in training (even if it's self-training), maintenance (in 5 years your speedy Mac won't be so speedy anymore), and upgrades (IIRC you already can't install the latest version of Xcode on anything older than Snow Leopard; I imagine this trend will continue).<p>I know people like you seem to think that it's an easy binary decision: 1) don't buy a Mac and don't develop for the iPhone, or 2) buy a Mac and develop for the iPhone, but there's a lot that goes into that decision, including a judgment of whether or not developing an app that you may not be ""allowed"" to distribute is worthwhile.<p>It's not so cut and dried.",1270935036

Game over.<p>However, if the recipient of the shared document is also interested in the timed destruction of the document, you could encrypt the document and escrow the key on a web server. The host of the web server promises to erase the key after a certain time, and the recipient promises to delete all unencrypted copies of the document and temporary encryption keys.<p>What I have just described above is a much simpler way to implement Vanish (<a href=""http://vanish.cs.washington.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanish.cs.washington.edu/</a>) if you allow the use of a trusted web server.

Let me give a quick example of what that means:<p>Twitter has 34 job openings (<a href=""http://twitter.com/positions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/positions.html</a>). They, being Twitter, don't have a hard time finding people so their jobs aren't on CareerBuilder/Monster (<a href=""http://jobsearch.monster.com/Search.aspx?brd=1&cn=Twitter&cy=us&lid=316&re=502"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobsearch.monster.com/Search.aspx?brd=1&cn=Twitte...</a>). The other job aggregators, like Indeed or SimplyHired, only have the jobs that have been copied onto other sites (<a href=""http://www.indeed.com/jobs?as_cmp=Twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indeed.com/jobs?as_cmp=Twitter</a> - note the links don't actually go to the company website). We (LinkUp) have all their jobs - <a href=""http://www.linkup.com/results.php#c=Twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkup.com/results.php#c=Twitter</a>. Another HN-worthy list is <a href=""http://www.linkup.com/lists/Y_Combinator_Startups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkup.com/lists/Y_Combinator_Startups</a>, but you'll have to guess what the link is...<p>The technology behind LinkUp takes a lot more work than your standard scrape because many companies make it difficult to get to a reusable link to an individual job, and there's no unified format to tell title from description from location. And right now we only have a hair over 20,000 companies, so I don't tell anyone that we're the only site a jobseeker should use - just the first;-)",1270933324

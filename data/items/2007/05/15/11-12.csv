They are correct. <p>I'm trying to make another point-- its very arrogant to assume that because this is the situation now, that this will always be the situation. <p>America used to be the manufacturer that supplied the world.  That is no longer the case, and even 30 years ago if someone said that we would have a 100 billion dollar trade deficit with china come 2010, virtually nobody would believe you.   IF a major public figure said that, then the newspapers would be full of editorials smugly decrying his foolishness.<p>I think its in error to assume that there is something fundamental about the US (and especially about one particular US city) that gives it superiority in the area of innovation.   Yes, culture helps, but the whole of america has the american culture,  not just san francisco.<p>And many countries in the world are starting to get capitalism-- this is no longer the exclusive domain of america. <p>So, I submit that the future great centers of technological boom are going to be in asia, possibly the middle east, and possible former eastern europe. <p>The end of the Tang dynasty in america happened about 20 years ago, and we are well into the Liao-- it takes time for the effect to be readily apparent to everyone.<p>But the cultural revolution has happened and we lost.  America is descendant.  (China may not be ascendant in anything other than manufacturing- they are still a strong regime and their government has not losened its grip yet.) <p>Increasingly, innovation will happen outside of the US.  This is already the case with consumer electronics. <p>Software is only 10 or 20 years away.<p>",1179229003

You're kissing ass, and you've been doing it as long as I've been here.<p>Ironically, I don't find much that I dislike about Paul Graham.  But the cult of PG is another matter. <p>If you read my posts you will find that I always provide an alternative solution and generally argue for why it is a better solution.  Dont' get VC funding- you don't need it, you can lease the infrastrcture you need, and use open source tools.  I even quoted PG saying essentialyl the same thing-- yet this position is the number one thing that people argue with me about here.<p>I do find it curious that the primary argument made against me is the fallacy of authority:\n""But people who are clearly more experienced and successful than you seem to disagree.""<p>I am not making any arguments based on my success, and you certainly don't know my level of success or lack of it.  But you sure seem to think you do. <p>"":and yet they seem to think YC is an amazing opportunity that they would have loved to have when starting out.""<p>The thing that most makes this community cult-like is the constant reliance of repeated ideology.  The third time you hear the same ""Argument"" you start to wonder if everyone isn't reading from the same textbook.  (And this text book seems to be full of appeals to authority.) <p>And the worst thing is that there's an ideology here!<p>Why does it have to be combative?  Why does anyone who provies a different opinion need to be attacked or percieved as attacking?<p>You start off by impunging my motives... but I am more tame than Paul Graham is.  Do you question the motives  of his essays simply because he's not tame?  Again, colored perception.<p>""clearly more experienced and successful than you""<p>You know, I think that's the core of it-- Paul had a mild success, and he's written a lot of opinionated articles.  The cult of personality is therefore one that worships success... I haven't bragged about my success, I've argued without appeal to authority.  But that carries less weight, doesn't it? ",1179228181

22201,comment,18917,21853,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Dude, I got modded down and I'm not complaining. The math is true and I'd be an idiot to disagree. However, with all due respect, you are missing something fundamental. If all we need is an absolute number of smart people, there have been plenty over the past millenia, and humans should be crazily more advanced than now.<p>If you want to talk about China, sure. From my limited understanding, China was an innovation center in the Tang dynasty. What about the Liao dynasty? I can't say the same. It's safe to say that the Chinese population only increased after a prosperous dynasty, so math-wise, the number of smart people increased too, but not so for innovation. There are obviously other factors at work.<p>I will not be so bold to claim that I have all the answers, but cultural climate is definitely important, and this is the basis of my comment. Japan has roughly half the population of USA and on par if not superior in communications technology. Why am I not surprised they didn't come out with a superior search engine? Online auctioning? Why am I not surprised that China's largest student social network started as a exact copy of facebook? Adoption of new web technologies is still slow. Because new ideas are still <i>imported</i>.",1179227352

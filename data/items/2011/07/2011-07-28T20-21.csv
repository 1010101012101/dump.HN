You can't say, ""Oh, this is a good decision and this was a good Court,"" simply because you like the result. It seems to you that the person, who deserved to win, won. That's not the business judges are in.<p>We don't sit here to make the law, to decide who ought to win. We decide who wins under the law that the people have adopted. And very often, if you're a good judge, you don't really like the result you're reaching. You would rather that the other side had won, and it seems to you a foolish law.<p>But in this job -- it's garbage in, garbage out. If it's a foolish law, you are bound by oath to produce a foolish result because it's not your job to decide what is foolish and what isn't. It's the job of the people across the street.<p>So don't judge judges unless you really take the trouble to read the opinion and see what provisions of law were at issue and what they were trying to reconcile and whether they did an honest job of reconciling them, and if interpreting the words of the law in a fair fashion. That's what counts. Unless that's what you want your judges to do, you have a judiciary that's not worth much. You have a judiciary that is just making the law instead of being faithful to what the people have decided.'<p>I know this is a broad generalization but typically a conservative judge goes for strict interpretation and a liberal judge goes for desired outcome.",1311886432

If you've got a bunch of constants like you gave, they will probably all have different hashcodes so you don't have to compare against all of them.<p>I checked what happens when you use an enum, and it generates some funky code. It creates an anonymous inner class with a static initializer for an array of ints. It uses the ordinal value to assign a sequential number starting with one. Then the switch statement is on intArray[theEnum.ordinal()], and the case statements start with 1. Here's the code:<p><pre><code>  class Test2{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      MyEnum en = MyEnum.ONE;
      switch (en) {
        case ONE:
          System.out.println(""one""); break;

          System.out.println(""two""); break;
        default:
          System.out.println(""default"");
       }
    }
  }

  enum MyEnum {
    ONE, TWO, THREE;
  }
</code></pre>

    {
        MyEnum myenum = MyEnum.ONE;
        static class _cls1

I wonder why it doesn't just switch on the ordinal directly. It's also worth noting that it has to make an array for MyEnum.values().length. This means if you have an enum with a lot of values, you're wasting a lot of memory (especially since it creates this array every class you use a switch in).
I tried with an enum with 40 values, and it didn't switch to a map. Maybe there's some higher threshold where it would switch to a map instead (but again, I don't understand why it wouldn't switch on ordinal() directly).",1311886424

I never intended to say that I was ""embarrassed by my gender"" as Michael seemed to believe and I dont think that the guys in that classroom were participating in offensive sexist behavior (most of the time they werent.) 
And women of course rate other women and men, both sexually and just with stereotypes. However, all that doesnt change that slight feeling of intrusion, and isolation. Ive worked in various companies now, and on every team Ive been on (even teams as large 30 developers) I was the only woman, so it was good practice walking into that classroom in the university. Sometimes, it is still a little lonely.<p>But here I am coding at a prestigious gaming company, and I agree, a lot of other women could do the same. But, if I wasnt so determined if during university I didnt think that programming starcraft was the definition of cool  I might have decided it wasnt worth it to go into that room every day. I could have gone to study biology or architecture or psychology and not felt the least bit awkward. And I had girl friends who I would convince that programming is dead useful by automating something for them. I would try to convince them they should sign up to some programming class and they would say nah, too much testosterone.<p>Im really not trying to make men into villains or creeps with this monolog. In fact, Im trying to say that before we get to the sexist creeps who assume I cant code because youre a girl or that I wont be able to understand what they are talking about because Im not the type who can do math Before all that, you have to walk into a room where you are different and alone. I realize that this is what it feels like to be a minority. As a white woman it isnt something Im used to feeling, but every time I stepped into a CS classroom I definitely did. Obviously none of these are obstacles that are impossible to overcome, and if women had no choice in the university  Im sure most of them would be perfectly capable of walking into a room full of guys and getting a degree in CS. Some of them might even enjoy it.<p>PS thanks thricedotted for explaining the intruder/invisible feeling better",1311886029

Solutions such as automatic type-specializing containers don't carry this downside, and carry the same upside.  For example at the moment PyPy type-specializes dictionaries.  Python has a single `dict` type, which can store anything, but we type specialize and fallback if we get it wrong.  Similarly, we're working on type-specializng lists, tuples, and user objects.

Plug that WsgiHttpProxy app to your middleware and plug your middleware into another instance of your HTTP server.  Rinse and repeat for as many middleware layers as you want.

But I'm not as concerned with higher education, I think that is a different system with a different goal.<p>Primary schools need to educate everyone, as a minimal level of what our society needs to move in a positive direction. Private schools would be incentivized to abandon problem kids that hurt their bottom line by screwing up their average scores and what not. This is even happening in public schools with some of the stupid testing schemes we've implemented, but it would be far worse imo with private schools.",1311884078

The point is throwing money and bodies at the problems of education has a proven track record of NOT working.<p>Those results that you refer to apply to a suburban school in high-income area with few challenges. Those students have an edge because they have parents (note the plural) who can fill in the blanks left at school or have the resources to hire someone to do that. That's why the stoner white kids from the suburbs graduate from high school and the middle of the pack urban students get swept out the door.<p>I live in a small city with low costs (standard of living index is 1.1) where the per-pupil costs are in excess of $23,000/child, the average teacher salary is $85k, median income in the city is $50k, the graduation rate is 42%, and in many elementary schools less than 15% of the 4th graders are in the upper half of state testing results for math.<p>That NYC multi-modal experiment offers the promise of bridging the gap between urban students without access to supplemental instruction and the suburban kids who have lots of resources available. Kids spend time in large/small classroom settings, Khan-academy type computer applications and ""virtual"" tutoring. Results are measured and kids get rotated through various modes of learning based on their results.<p>What does that mean? It means that we can improve education and reduce the inequity in our society without throwing $100k+ teachers into the breach like infantrymen. Being born in a city shouldn't condemn you to a marginal education and future prospects.<p>It's not a matter of being ""against"" teachers or whatever -- it's applying their talents strategically in a way that benefits the students.

2818639,comment,2816722,2817579,6,0,adamtj,,,"WSGI is _not_ a framework.  It's a <i>gateway interface</i>, like CGI.  Django is a web application <i>framework</i>.  You don't (usually) write apps using a raw gateway interface like WSGI or CGI.  You write web applications in a framework like Django or Pump.<p>The framework then needs to work with the web server -- but how?  To be portable and useful, a framework it should support CGI, SCGI, Fast-CGI, ISAPI, HTTP, etc.  That lots of work to do for every single framework.  Big ones and little ones all need to support all those interfaces, and you know they won't.  That's the whole point of WSGI: to be one single abstraction to bind all web servers to all frameworks.<p>If you want to write a framework, WSGI sets the bar pretty dang low.  It supports pretty much everything you need to do HTTP without too many awkward quirks.  You don't need to worry about how to implement a fast-cgi->nginx adapter.  You just make your framework talk WSGI and plug it into existing nginx->fast-cgi and fast-cgi->wsgi libraries.  Done.<p>WSGI was carefully designed to be as simple as possible, but no simpler.  It is simple, but powerful and flexible.  It's possible to write powerful composable middleware that works with <i>any</i> webserver and <i>any</i> framework, because middleware is just a WSGI app that wraps a WSGI app.  Middleware can transparently add sessions, caching, compression, chunking, etc, that don't need to be tightly coupled to the framework or the webserver.  So, just like WSGI can bind all webservers to all frameworks, any middleware can insert itself between any framework/webserver pair (I'm sure there are exceptions, of course).  The framework shouldn't have to screw around with chunked encodings or compression.  WSGI's design allows one good library to easily do that work regardless of the rest of your stack.<p>This article spoke about how awkward send_request() is.  What it does is make it trivial for middleware to read, add, and modify headers without having to parse HTTP.  Suppose you want to write a javascript obfuscator.  One way to do that is to write some middleware that detects Content-Type=""text/javascript"" and obfuscates the response.  Because of the way send_request() works, you detect javascript by looking at a variable, not writing an HTTP parser.  Also, if you write that middleware for Django, it'll work unchanged when you get fed up and switch frameworks.<p>The whole write() vs yield vs return thing can is awkward, but it makes it easier to write a wsgi adapter for older cgi-based frameworks that respond via sys.stdout.write().<p>Only framework, middleware and gateway authors have to care about WSGI.  If a framework author is complaining about WSGI, he or she almost definitely don't understand where WSGI came from or what problem it's really solving.<p>WSGI is minimal, composable, and elegant, even considering that it's backwards compatible with older frameworks.  If everything supports WSGI, then everything can just be plugged into everything else without much screwing around.  Composability and loose coupling are very powerful, especially at the levels of the stack where WSGI lives.",1311883249

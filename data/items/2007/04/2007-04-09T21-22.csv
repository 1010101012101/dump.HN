Three years of law school in the US really doesn't teach you a whole lot - you learn everything on the job. You're basically paying for a law firm's reputation sometimes.<p>He's right, though - the best gauge for quality of service is experience. Get a lawyer with lots of experience in your area, or at least work with a boutique firm that specializes in your field. They will be expensive. Ask around first - other companies have a firm they work with, or in-house lawyers who can recommend a firm. Don't go with an asshole bigshot just because he has the experience - you're in the long haul with your lawyers, so make it pleasant as possible. Never forget that law is primarily a service industry, and he should be listening to you as well as offering advice. <p>The other side of the coin is this: don't hide anything from your lawyer. He can't save you from the pit you dug yourself if you don't tell him about it. You'll save yourself a lot in fees, believe me. ",1176154819

Yet, for the longest time I was confused about what exactly ""karma"" stood for. I knew it was a measurement of some sort(hey what else can a number be?) but I'd no idea about what exactly having ""more karma"" means.<p>My point is that when you use such phrases, you are assuming a specific kind of audience. Use of karma for reddit(tech-focused) is fine; even for news.yc it's fine -  but for a consumer website, you should be very careful about introduction of new words. And say you love the word karma so much that you insist on using it - in that case, have a page that clearly explains what karma is assuming that the user knows nothing about it.<p>Karma is just one example - larger point here is to be careful about use of individual words that may have a huge role to play in your website. Thing that triggered me to make this post is I saw another poster use ""karma"" on their consumer start-up(bad idea IMO). <p>This is a mistake that is so easy to commit. Heck we did it when we launched. A lot of our users that were playing songs on our site had no idea what ""Jigg It!"" button meant. After couple user mails inquiring about it, we put up a tooltip saying ""Jigg It if you like it!"". Suddenly more people were clicking on it. <p>--Zaid

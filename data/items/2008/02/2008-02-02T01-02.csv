RP cuts  through the Commonwealth nations marking those who speak it, as <i>""English educated""</i>. It doesn't matter if you are from Calcutta, or Canberra, Kingston or Kowloon. If you have received RP  training you can still be understood.<p>RP or <i>""Received pronunciation""</i> is a technique that provides accentless enunciation of <i>""Standard English""</i>.  Taught to foreigners (mostly Commonwealth) as an effective means of communication across language barriers. It is most often (mistakenly) associated only with the English upper class , classically trained Shakespearian actors and BBC World service announcers.<p><i>""... To do so he looked at three well-studied parts of the linguistic family tree: the Bantu languages of Africa, the Indo-European group from Eurasia and the Austronesians of the Pacific. ...""</i><p>Who are <i>""Austronesians""</i>?<p>Without looking at Dr. Pagels original work [0] I don't know if he used this term but in terms of language, the term ""Austronesians"" is a nonsense word. In Australia there are over 800 non english langauges. Probably about the same in  New Guinea. [1] This is not even including the Indonesia Archipelago which spreads 5000km across 1700 Islands. So to use such a term in a study of languages is a bit far fetched.<p><i>""... Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel and his colleagues at the University of Reading, UK, used a comparative database of Indo-European languages to trace the words used to express 200 different meanings in 87 different languages ...""</i><p>In New Scientist I found a better summary of what the study was about.

You can create your own grid if you'd like, create one with friends, or use our managed grid (for a service fee).<p>I think that Amazon S3, Nirvanix, and others are starting to provide nice basic services in this area as well, but I do think there is a lot of room for retaining and saving information that is gently locked into web services (Flickr, blogs, LinkedIn, etc.).",1201914732
108145,comment,107683,108108,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"Programming isn't math, but mathematical expressions are often found in programs, more or less so depending on the domain. My preference is to have readable mathematical expressions in programs that resemble the forms in which I see or use them elsewhere.<p>In the general case of complex logical and bitwise expressions, order of operations can cause a tremendous number of bugs. I like to use parentheses to make these cases absolutely unambiguous anyway. But I can't remember introducing a serious bug because I messed up order of operations between +- and X. Anyway, if it's such a problem, there's nothing to say you can't put parentheses around every operation in infix notation, at least in any language that I know of!<p>Maybe my preference relates to having a fairly visual memory for formulas and such. If I want to find a root of a quadratic equation, I do (-b + sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c))/(2 * a), and that is easy, and anyone with high school math sees that in someone's code they know what it is. (I probably have to check for a zero denominator and also look at the discriminant unless I'm directly using complex numbers, and there's also the conjugate root, but that doesn't change much.)<p>If I have to write (/ (+ (- b) (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c)))) (* 2 a)) then I can do it, but it takes a lot of thought and it doesn't go along with the way I think about the quadratic formula. Granted, this is because I learned it the way I did, but I also know I'm not the only one.<p>A footnote to that is that to my mathematical sensibilities, in list notation, using the same symbol for negation and subtraction is hideous!",1201914544
108144,comment,108061,108061,0,0,wallflower,,,"Reading the day-to-day story of The Point is entrancing to me, an ambitious yet too passive person. Entrancing in a way similar to that of watching awesome Salsa dancers in a Latin club about a year ago. Entrancing enough to get me to start taking lessons and eventually step out onto the public dance floor. Maybe The Point's story will entrance more of us to get out there and start our start-ups. Thank you for recognizing some of us who really want to know what lies ahead and beneath the romanticism of a real start-up.",1201914512

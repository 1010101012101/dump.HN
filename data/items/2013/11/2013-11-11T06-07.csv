There are needs to open/load/read those objects in database in very fast speed (< 0.01 seconds).   When I profiled those operations in early version of the code, the biggest bottleneck is always the malloc/free when the system reached > 10 millions records.<p>To get around those limitation, I end up design the data structures / datastore that eliminated the malloc/free, new/delete and do my own memory manager to map all the info directly to the structure in the file via mmap and do my own sub allocations.   With those, I can get everything in < 0.01 seconds constant access time regardless the size of the database.  (from startup of the program to return the value to client.)<p>I think all modern day database or BIG DATA type system app depend on its own custom memory manager.

6710293,comment,6706011,6706405,3,0,acesubido,,,"I suppose, It&#x27;s about the environment. There are many factors to consider.<p>First, logistically speaking, transport, supply and communication lines in the Philippines are hard to establish because we&#x27;re an archipelago of 7,000+ islands. The unique geography makes it hard for mass evacuations. Go to high areas, suffer landslides and wind damage, stay low, storm surges wipe you out.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about the Indian typhoon season, but the Pacific typhoon season, since the 90&#x27;s on average, starts at January-March and ends at November-December: it doesn&#x27;t stop. Fortunately we&#x27;ve had good years, such as the 1998 storm season, the first storm system formed started in July at that time. On average, most of the Pacific storm systems hit us every 3 weeks, there are certain months where parts of the country get hit by a typhoon every other week. So almost all resources are poured into constantly getting supply lines and shelters re-established.<p>Given this, we Filipinos have been taught, even the children, to consider typhoons to be normal and to have their distinct personalities to look out for. I remember back in 2009 that we took a direct hit with Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy). It wasn&#x27;t expected to deal that much damage since Hurricane strength is generally associated with wind speed, the measured wind speed wasn&#x27;t that high. What we didn&#x27;t we know was that it brought 454.9 mm rainfall in the Metropolis, flooding rural areas in our capital region as high as 4-6meters. Uncertainty is high, resources are low, the islands of Samar and Leyte got hit badly: the eyewall brought in the surge from the east and when the storm passed by, the tail surged the sea inward from the west.<p>Also, it&#x27;s hard to get good data. Info and news from the media and government are unorganized, each have their own databases, and not to mention, their own agendas to look good.<p>Majority of Filipinos consider the lack of financial resources as the biggest factor due to politics and corruption. As mentioned in the comments above, the mayor of the city of Dumaguete can only set aside something like $9,000 USD. Not a lot of resources, considering that&#x27;s just enough to buy a car here in the Philippines.<p>The lack of resources and wealth, the difficulty of re-establishing supply lines sets up an environment for such casualties despite preparations.",1384152011

I doubt anyone posting here has actually felt hunger.<p>That feeling of &quot;I should eat something now&quot; is either appetite, or ritual (and/or carb addiction). If you are not malnourished, it often takes 20 days of fasting for hunger to appear (as many as 40), and when it arrives, you&#x27;ll realize it is there: It&#x27;s not a feeling that goes away if you&#x27;re immersed in a book, work project or video game. It&#x27;s a feeling that you&#x27;ll be willing to fight for food now, if needs be. (Addiction can also cause that feeling, but addiction will go away if your mind is taken with other things.

Usually, appetite comes back within a day or two. A few times, it took over 10 and over 20 days.<p>Food consumption, hunger and appetite have no simple linear relationship. After two days of fasting (voluntary or forced), the appetite disappears. I know that seems very unlikely to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it, because it seems like the appetite (or a feeling you call hunger) just keeps getting stronger when you don&#x27;t eat - to the point that it would be impossible to sustain if it continued linearly.

This company had an US customer and I was the one who built his entire system. After some misunderstanding between the customer and the company&#x27;s owner, the customer wanted me to work for him directly from home, and this was discussed with the owner, my boss at the time. My boss agreed and I started working for this customer from home, and continued to work at the web shop for some time until he introduced me to another US company who wanted to hire me for a full time remote position, which I accepted and I still work for this company to this day. A couple years ago I was relocated to live close to the HQ so I could be in the office :)<p>* What advice I&#x27;d give to others<p>- Discipline/Productivity<p>You have to be very disciplined in order to be able to work remotely. You need to pay attention to your time and make sure you work the hours you are getting paid.
You may work less hours, but in a worst case scenario, you end up working much more than you are supposed to.<p>- Communication<p>Your coworkers can&#x27;t see you. You boss can&#x27;t see you. Make sure you keep in touch and reply to emails in a timely manner. This is key to show that you are committed to the job.<p>- Working from home<p>If you can, avoid working from home or try not to make the same mistakes I did, below. 
The first two months I was working from home full time were great! Freedom! But then it almost drove me crazy. I had nobody to talk to, I&#x27;d barely leave the apartment.
It was a small apartment, so I kept my workstation in my bedroom... don&#x27;t do it. Ever.
At some point I caught myself working 12 to 16 hours a day. When that happened I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was working from home or living at work. (And I wasn&#x27;t getting paid by the hour).
I spoke with my boss about this issue and the company agreed to rent a small place for me to work from, since there was no public space or this concept of shared office that I could use to work from.<p>* My favorite story<p>Well, I went from a one guy working alone from home to building a team, becoming a manager, hiring more people, relocating to the US and becoming a CTO. And it all started with that first remote job :)<p>Sorry about the long post. I hope something here is useful for you.<p>Good luck!",1384150225

I learned the skill to work under pressure of a day or two or night and quickly deliver things that JUST WORK or being able to learn some thing needed very fast. Also i got a chance to broaden my skill set a lot by working on any project that interested me. So i still continue to do that on and off. This also provided me a chance to work with several open source projects (vlc, dnrd, kannel, netsnmp) and still make money. So i continue to do it still for all of the above reasons.<p>How i got into it in the first place? Took tests and scored well in areas i claimed skills in, charged a lot less initially, under promised and over deliverd to earn very good feedback, started with small jobs. Once i got a client satisfied with small jobs, they came back with bigger ones latter. Gradually increased rates and maintained an online profile i.e. public domain code written by one&#x27;s self among other things. During all this, i even had an option to work full time dedicated to some body for a long time with good money. Just couldn&#x27;t find enough time i.e. didn&#x27;t feel like leaving existing job and go in.<p>With remote work, you get to manage your own schedule. But it is harder to be organized and you need more effort to justify time spent achieving a goal vs when sitting in an office.<p>The challenge in latter parts of life (when you have young kids) is to be able to find enough time to work when you are physically active i.e. sitting late night on a sofa after kids being asleep with laptop doesn&#x27;t work very well.<p>Forgot to mention that this whole effort sort of reduced the fear of being jobless since one becomes more confident about your possible prospects of work whether local full time or remote. For this reason every one should work this way at least for some time in life IMHO.",1384150137

Go created a smarter C, and presented it as the solution.  The problem though is that C++ people likely aren&#x27;t C purists to begin with, or that C purists are too into C.  Compounded by those who only drop to C when needed, you begin to see why it failed initially in this segment.  I do think it will continue to gain adoption, but linux is such a firm C membership club that it will either be painfully slow, or else require Go to play nicer with C.",1384150009

Internal communication can be handled easily if people understand and <i>trust</i> each other. The unearned mistrust targeted towards high performers and envy of less competent managers/coworkers is what is killing corporations nowadays, not remote work.<p>I love to work alone (on deep analytical problems) as well as love to collaborate with others in person or over Internet (putting pieces together and having fun creating) - location doesn&#x27;t matter nowadays anymore and if it matters to you, you might end up behind the times as you won&#x27;t be attractive to many people, some of them invaluable.",1384149998

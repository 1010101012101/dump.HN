Fallacious reasoning is not reasoning that is incorrect under one set of axioms that may be correct under a different set of axioms. It&#x27;s reasoning that draws illogical inferences from available evidence. An argument that is fallacious under one set of axioms will still be fallacious under a different set.<p>Second, you&#x27;re taking his argument wildly out of context. There is a well-established literature on the fact that human behavior often deviates from the rational actor model, as a result of cognitive bias and fallacious reasoning, and that results in economic inefficiency: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics</a>.

Think of how many people die each year in car accidents, while odd and bizarre deaths make the news. Conventional weapons are, as the tin says, &#x27;conventional.&#x27; These are the normal weapons of conflict, nothing special to see here, move along.<p>Chemical, biological, and atomic/nuclear weapons are uncommon, and easy to define as being different in kind, rather than size or effect. This bright line is easier to understand.<p>Of those three non-conventional kinds, chemical weapons were once widely used during WWI. The horror of chemical weapons is not so much the deaths but the large number of people who survived, and lived with afflictions for the rest of their life. While conventional weapons leave people with missing limbs and scars and mental problems, chemical weapons tended to leave people who needed much more medical care, and suffered more. Chemical weapons weren&#x27;t part of WWII in part because of the memories of the afflicted of WWI.<p>But only a part. Another is that chemical weapons aren&#x27;t that effective against trained soldiers, and a change in breeze can as easily send the gas against one&#x27;s own soldiers, or to the civilian population, which increases the likelihood of poor collateral damage.<p>Thus, chemical weapons are more easily interpreted as a means of killing a civilian population, rather than killing opposing soldiers. This is not acceptable in our agreed upon fantasy of rules for good warfare.<p>Had it been conventional bombs we could continue with the belief that they were after enemy combatants, who used civilians as shields.",1377287474

I kind-of-know MVC (or whatever Angular is) frameworks so to make things a challenge, I took the Todo/Hello-world Angular apps and re-wrote them in CoffeeScript. There was enough mental exercise there that my brain didn&#x27;t atrophy from looking at Todo/Hello-world-level code, and at the same time, I got some practice with CoffeeScript.<p>I guess the main &quot;resource&quot; that made this possible was with Yeoman, which chirped at me everytime I screwed up in CoffeeScript (i.e. missed a whitespace) and made it easy, via TDD, to slowly construct an Angular app despite being incredibly confused with some of Angular&#x27;s magic.",1377287168

Others would come up with new stuff, and Microsoft would &quot;embrace and extend&quot; whatever got traction in the market by adding it to their near-monopoly OS/app stack at whatever price served the purpose of eliminating the inventor and taking their market.<p>This strategy always made Gates paranoid, because the risk was that some alternative to the MS stack would take off too quickly to be killed. Without their near monopoly power as a weapon, they would have no special competitive advantage.<p>What they feared happened in the mid-90&#x27;s when the Web took off and the browser/Java combo threatened to be a universal VM on top of every PC. Gates fought back with every weapon he had to fragment the universality of the meta-platform. He was able to greatly slow, but not stop, the emergence of an OS-independent Web, because he controlled the majority of the OS market underneath it.<p>But then the second shoe dropped. Mobile came along and MS was not able to stop its explosive growth. The growth of mobile made MS just another minority OS underneath the Web, and they lost their ability to disrupt the standardization of the Web platform. They were in the position they had always feared: having to support the standards of others or be abandoned by their customers as the Web became the new monopoly platform.<p>If Ballmer could have created the mPhone and mPad and given away for free an mOS for phones that was a mini, modified version of .Net, maybe they could have kept the Web fragmented and continued their platform dominance, but whether that was even possible (MS did things second, not first, was only a minor hardware developer, and seldom gave things away except when tied to something they sold), I&#x27;ll never know. Gates got to wield monopoly power; Ballmer didn&#x27;t.<p>MS&#x27;s monopoly-based business model has to be abandoned, but do they have any other? They&#x27;ll come up with something, as IBM did, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll ever be leaders again, because they didn&#x27;t really &quot;lead&quot; before, except in market share.<p>Google&#x27;s business model (expand the Web platform for free, dominate Web advertising, and employ an army of PhDs looking for something besides advertising to do) is nothing like Microsoft&#x27;s. If they ever lost advertising, they&#x27;d go down harder than MS, and they could lose it if they ever lost much search mindshare.<p>And Facebook? They&#x27;re a website.

Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, with the potential to damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.<p>- polyacrylamide: Concerns have been raised that polyacrylamide used in agriculture may contaminate food with the nerve toxin acrylamide.<p>- Ethylene glycol (the stuff in antifreeze): Ethylene glycol is moderately toxic with an oral LDLO = 786 mg/kg for humans.[8] The major danger is due to its sweet taste. Because of that, children and animals are more inclined to consume large quantities of it than of other poisons. Upon ingestion, ethylene glycol is oxidized to glycolic acid which is, in turn, oxidized to oxalic acid, which is toxic. It and its toxic byproducts first affect the central nervous system, then the heart, and finally the kidneys. Ingestion of sufficient amounts can be fatal if untreated.<p>- glutaraldehyde: As a strong disinfectant, glutaraldehyde is toxic and a strong irritant<p>- Isopropyl alcohol (I think this stuff is in aerosol deodorant and hairspray): Isopropyl alcohol and its metabolite, acetone, act as central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Symptoms of isopropyl alcohol poisoning include flushing, headache, dizziness, CNS depression, nausea, vomiting, anesthesia, and coma.",1377286544

(Grass-fed, organic, etc.) However, you might well notice the difference between cooking one rare vs. well done, or one cooked on a charcoal grill vs. fried in a pan. Hand brewing vs. using a Mr. Coffee or an Aeropress is much the same. It does make a difference in how it tastes, and the big difference is a matter of preference.<p>There&#x27;s also the matter of doing things right vs. wrong. Whether your ground beef was from Whole Foods might matter a whole lot less than whether it was properly refrigerated or whether the cook burned it. When it comes to coffee, Americans have been trained to tolerate beans and grinds that are a bit on the old and stale side. Some people go to a shop for beans roasted yesterday or today for the improved flavor, and some go to that shop as a matter of conspicuous consumption, and for some it&#x27;s a mix of the two.

If two very intelligent youngsters create their own private language, and if the language produces communication, how can that not be called a legitimate use of language?<p>It&#x27;s an entirely legitimate use of languages, and both speakers of that language can understand each other.  Doesn&#x27;t mean those two speakers won&#x27;t disagree on the meanings of certain words.  Add a third speaker and the language will develop more nuances.<p>Yes, language exists to communicate.  Like it or not, some attempts at communication will be perceived as correct, and some will not.  Assuming you speak or write in an attempt to communicate, and not just to hear yourself talk, you need to care about that perception.<p>You talk about communication between two people; that&#x27;s already sufficient to raise this issue.  One person may speak or write, and the other person may hear or read, and while the second person&#x27;s very flexible parsers may correctly interpret meaning, those same parsers will also generate signals like &quot;this person seems quite intelligent&quot; or &quot;this person writes like a lazy teenager on a cell phone&quot;.  Useful language guides will tell you not just the meanings of words, but also how those words will be perceived by your audience.<p>When I referred to &quot;consensus&quot;, I simply meant this kind of information about perception, scaled up to the entire population of speakers of a language, and made statistical.  There&#x27;s a fuzzy scale from &quot;wrong&quot; to &quot;colloquial&quot; to &quot;dialect&quot; to &quot;variation&quot; to unqualified &quot;correct&quot;.<p>A dictionary that said &quot;there&quot; is a possessive pronoun also written as &quot;their&quot;, without commenting on correct and incorrect usage, would not be nearly as useful as a dictionary that does.",1377285671

Well, because on the other side, the greatest efficiencies are only accessible to the wealthiest people: There is an &quot;efficiency&quot; (quality of life) gradient that is directly tied to personal wealth, and it&#x27;s disgusting.

Invention is creating something with ones own ingenuity, as opposed to replicating something.<p>So I don&#x27;t quite see how experimenting and observing effects goes counter to that. Predictive science is great, but the theoretical models you use stem from observation as well. The only difference is that you get to experiment virtually, and that you can narrow down things.<p>So yeah, innovating/inventing requires rubbing things together and seeing what happens. Imagine innovating without eventually rubbing things together (in a wider sense of course). It wouldn&#x27;t make sense.",1377284643

6265621,comment,6263064,6265233,1,0,takeoutweight,,,"Re 1. Periodicity: \nThe quantum Fourier transform is an operation that reflects information about a quantum state into the the phases of the amplitudes. Quantum phase information is exactly where quantum computing differs from classical probabilistic computing, so it makes sense that this technique might show up in places where quantum computing beats classical. For example: Shor&#x27;s factorization of integers makes direct use of the quantum Fourier transform. I mention periodicity only as an example of a sort of problem where the Fourier transform might be useful. This is as an alternative intuition to what quantum computers are &quot;good at&quot; to combat the notion that &quot;quantum computing is good for parallel problems.&quot;<p>Re 2. &quot;covering all paths&quot;:\nI don&#x27;t have a problem interpreting quantum superposition as inhabiting all possible states. However, classical probabilistic computing also can be interpreted this way: an un-flipped coin is both heads and tails until the flipping happens. But probabilistic computing doesn&#x27;t give us faster-than-classical speedup, therefore it&#x27;s not just the &quot;existing in all states at once&quot; that buys us the speedup: it&#x27;s the unique kind of math we can do on these states because our amplitudes are unitary-complex, not positive-real.<p>You understand this distinction, so I perhaps shouldn&#x27;t have adopted the tone I did (sorry!). The leap between &quot;superposition involves a complex-valued combination of several states&quot; and &quot;tries all answers at once so is very fast&quot; is a very common leap made in popular science articles and is the kind of misconceptions that I think the &quot;quantum computers are good at parallel&quot; intuition encourages. Just because a quantum state is a superposition doesn&#x27;t mean we get to, for free, observe and evaluate all those states and pick out the one we like. We can <i>sometimes</i> arrange things in such a way that the quantum phases interact non-classically to leverage the structure of <i>some</i> problems to reveal information that isn&#x27;t available to classical algorithms.<p>Periodicity information, via the quantum Fourier transform, is an example of one way to arrange things to extract information that would be more expensive to calculate classically.",1377284496

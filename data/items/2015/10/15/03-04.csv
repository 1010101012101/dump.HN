That&#x27;s a ridiculously bad situation to be in as a developer: we have a great deal of choice in where we work, and it&#x27;s poor strategy to let someone else decide for you just because they had enough money to buy out your boss. So developers choose. And they generally choose to leave because the acquiring company is overwhelming the culture they chose to work in with a culture they didn&#x27;t.<p>This is different: everyone in this situation gets to evaluate the others and make a choice about their involvement in a business relationship.

To sum it up, it basically feels less like you&#x27;re getting an on-demand professional driver/ taxi, and a lot more like you&#x27;re just flagging a lift from some guy with a car.<p>The cars themselves are a big step down - much older, smaller, worn out interiors, sometimes even without seatbelts. On numerous occasions the drivers have been far from the professional driver standard. In general they get the job done but they sometimes don&#x27;t know the roads very well, and I&#x27;ve run the full spectrum of issues like them taking forever to get to the pickup point, often driving past it and circling back round a one-way system etc, having to take ridiculous detours en route because they miss a turn, going via obviously gridlocked routes, asking me for directions along the way to the destination. All of the things you just don&#x27;t expect to happen with a driver service but you might expect to happen if you asked a friend for a lift. It&#x27;s not a guaranteed slick service like it previously was, at all.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what happened here but this, along with the Android app being fairly buggy and <i>seeming</i> to get worse over time (takes minutes to lock GPS coordinates, really kills my battery, sometimes completely freezes when you&#x27;re tracking them coming to pick you up, gives you a locking error message when you&#x27;ve lost your data connection so you can&#x27;t even see the map, or the license plate of the car, any more) has really downgraded my impression of uber from something which was all-round vastly better than taxis, to a something which is basically on the same level and that I&#x27;ll just use when it&#x27;s not that convenient to hail a taxi on the street. And I&#x27;m no big fan of taxis.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, I used to rave about uber to anyone who&#x27;d listen, but if the level of service for the same cost continues to slide like this here and in other cities then I could see myself looking for and switching to competitors much more often where previously I had no real need or desire to.",1444880181

The person with the lacerations and injured palms was behind the car when, according to Tesla, they accelerated into him.  The two people in the ATV were in front of the car.  It becomes more difficult to claim the injuries inflicted were accidental when they manage two separate &#x27;accidents&#x27; in a small amount of time, but we&#x27;ll have to see the accident reconstruction to see whose claims hold up.<p>> Again I don&#x27;t want to apologize for the illegal and dangerous actions of the RGJ employees here but (1) this isn&#x27;t the whole story and (2) I think it&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous that Tesla has their secur-- err &quot;safety&quot; staff heading people off at the pass in ATV&#x27;s and risking their lives over some illegal photos. It&#x27;s also possible that my skepticism is misplaced and Tesla is not exaggerating here and RGJ employees engaged in exactly the behavior described.<p>Wanting to read both accounts is reasonable and fair.  RGJ has their own account which you can read here:<p><a href=""http://www.rgj.com/story/news/2015/10/09/rgj-photographer-arrested-after-altercation-withtesla-security-guards/73693850/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rgj.com/story/news/2015/10/09/rgj-photographer-ar...</a><p>While you&#x27;re right that security should be trained not to do dangerous things like this over simple trespass for this exact reason, the big problem here is that both accounts of the story say that the RGJ journalists hit Tesla employees with a car.<p>That&#x27;s lethal force.<p>Unless they can show something like being in reasonable fear for their lives (or grievous bodily injury), the driver is in big trouble.  Nobody has alleged that the Tesla guards were trying to kill or maim the journalists.  There&#x27;s a mention that a rock was used on a window and a seat belt was cut, but neither side alleges any injury to the journalists or a threat thereof.<p>So it is sort of like when you have someone &#x27;resisting arrest&#x27; and only one side is injured.  But here, only the <i>cops</i> are injured.  I would normally give the injured side the benefit of any doubt when only one side shows injury, but that&#x27;s only when there&#x27;s doubt and they can show evidence to overcome that burden.  The Tesla guards were injured and they had lethal force used against them.<p>While we should wait to see what new facts come to light, the uncontested parts of the two stories paint spell serious legal trouble for the driver.  Neither account disputes that the RGJ driver used lethal force against and caused injury to Tesla security guards in an altercation over claims of trespass.  That&#x27;s worrisome.",1444879848

The interesting part is that if you&#x27;ve studied Demming you&#x27;ll know he pitched his process to every American manufacturer first - and all of them wrote him off, which, as we all know came back in spades from a quality comparison perspective shortly after.  Demming: Quality = Results of Work Efforts / Total Costs.<p>Regarding OTA: It is.  But, ignorance is even scarier.  Look at any company that embraces CI (continuous improvement).  Amazon - how many changes to production do they push a day?  Now compare that to a legacy F50 that has process designed to be change averse as they view that as risk in and of itself.  This seems to be the viewpoint you&#x27;re working from through GM and maybe (I&#x27;m speculating here) you&#x27;re influenced by the process internally. Maybe your view is that it&#x27;s risky because of what you&#x27;re exposed to?  My guess is that given the culture of Telsa - critical software OTA is not taken lightly.  Speculation - but they likely have a far more rigorous process for deployment than many others since they&#x27;ve done this from the beginning. If I can suggest reading on this subject I would point you in the direction of Gene Kim&#x27;s work in this area as he has studied high performing organizations and, in a nutshell, has found that companies that embrace change and do it frequently have less operational problems than those who don&#x27;t.  Risk-averse seems to compound mistakes and, this could very well flow into those hypothesis around practice.  The more you do, the better you are and &quot;10k&quot; hours.<p>While I agree accidents can (and will) happen - again I wouldn&#x27;t put my money that it happens to Tesla first or with any cadence of frequency.  Keep in mind Tesla is riding on quality in software - full stop.  If they have a problem there, it could be detrimental to the point of failure.  This is a good thing for consumers because they&#x27;re most likely getting a superior product comparatively.  And we already know that non-OTA software that has gone out the door in vehicles has caused death and harm.  Is it scary that those bits are note able to benefit from a timely OTA update?  There are definitely two sides to this coin.<p>And finally...  While I know that it&#x27;s been said quite a bit that &quot;we&#x27;ve done that&quot;.  I&#x27;m not truly sure people are grasping the reality of what Tesla is doing.  While I understand others have these features, the Jalopnik short sums up what they&#x27;ve accomplished that, in my opinion, others are definitely lagging behind in - if you haven&#x27;t watched it definitely do:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yCAZWdqX_Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yCAZWdqX_Y</a><p>Again...  Even if others are kind-of-sort-of doing this today, the iterations will be across model years.  No vendors have the long-term upgradability that Tesla does at this point.

Aircraft are sufficiently autonomous in nominal conditions that pilot skills atrophy, and then when the plane encounters adverse conditions, these de-skilled pilots simply do not respond correctly to the problem, crashing the plane. Specifically, I&#x27;m thinking of something like Air France Flight 447, where it turned out that the pilot and co-pilot had lost familiarity with how the Airbus A330 behaved while at cruising altitude.<p>Similarly, I&#x27;m worried that auto-drive and smart cruise control systems will take care of highway driving in the normal case, but when things go wrong and the auto-driver disengages, the human at the wheel will have forgotten that a car traveling at 60mph behaves differently than one traveling at 25mph. With aircraft, we can mitigate this risk by forcing pilots to spend extra time in the simulator, keeing their feel for the aircraft from decaying too badly. I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is for drivers. Maybe we can force everyone to play a racing sim for a few hours every month ;)",1444878619

8726679,comment,8725908,8726332,0,0,chez17,,,"Finally, a topic I&#x27;m somewhat of an expert in on HN!<p>>Even in &quot;regular sports&quot;, ratings rise when narratives like rivalries or dynasties are in play. We saw the decline of viewership in Starcraft:Broodwar in Korea when such narratives fizzled and when the old stars faded from relevance, despite the considerable increase in overall skill level.<p>There were new stars and new rivalries. This totally leaves out the Savior scandal, competing games, and how unique and what fluke BW actually was. A game never meant to be played competitively, pushed to it&#x27;s limits for years and years and years by the players and map makers, broken mechanics that turned out to balance the game near flawlessly. The list goes on and on. BW was an anomoly in the esports world, a game being played competitively 10 years after it&#x27;s made is not normal. Melee is the only game that comes to mind that is similar. Counter Strike is still being played of course, but not the original game, no patches, like BW or Melee.<p>>Starcraft 2 has arguably suffered from the relative lack of such a narrative, due in part to the fragmentation of its competitive scene.<p>I disagree 1000%! SC2 suffered from horrible balance decisions, a battle.net system that was objectively worse than BW and WC3, no LAN, and an over-zealous Blizzards-Activision that wanted to extract as much money as possible as quickly as possible. Things like putting limits on how much a prize pool can be before Blizzard takes a cut actually encouraged tournaments to stay smaller the first year or two of SC2. No LAN meant games would crap out and couldn&#x27;t be restarted with tens of thousands of dollars on the line. No automated tournaments, no clans, no nothing. Battle.net 2.0 was so bad, such a monumental fuck up, it shows that Blizzard literally had no idea what they were doing and did not care what the community thought. We begged for years for things that were not that hard to implement for a gigantic company like Blizzard. Finally, the balance. When you balance a game for the lowest level player, it may bring a short spike in players but the reward of a high skilled play is gone. There is no reason to work hard and figure things out. The competitive scene suffered due to these decisions. Finally, the worst choice of them all, to let Wings of Liberty (vanilla SC2) fester and die while they developed Heart of the Swarm (the first expansion). Broodlord/Infester became so boring and dull to watch for months and months while Blizzard didn&#x27;t do anything. They waited for HotS. And guess what? Want HotS? You have to buy the original as well! Good call! Not greedy at all. So many truly terrible decisions killed SC2 and it&#x27;s a damn shame. As you can tell, I&#x27;m bitter. SC2 had great narratives. Huk vs Korea, Boxer coming back, Nada coming back, Idra (love him or hate him), the EG/TL stuff then Huk going to EG!, so many great runs through GSL or MLG, White-Ra beating MC at that worlds game!, MMA the prodigy of Boxer, MMA vs MVP at Blizzcon, so many great stories. The scene died because Blizzard fucking killed it. My beautiful Starcraft destroyed out of greed and shortsightedness.",1418169378

It&#x27;s the only vehicle for equity building they ever had. Without some opportunity to build on your work in a <i>non-linear</i> fashion, you are just a wage slave forever.<p>I guess we&#x27;re going to reward all those artists and musicians who enriched our lives by making them eat dog food when they&#x27;re old...?<p>Sonny Bono always gets bashed for saying copyright should be &quot;forever and a day.&quot; I still don&#x27;t agree with him-- I think that position is too extreme.

After all, nobody has done more to forestall this report than the Democrat Barack Obama. In many ways, he&#x27;s the worst offender here as it was his administration that elected to protect the people involved instead of punishing them, which serves to normalize something that absolutely should not be normalized. After all, the deepest institutional damage is done not by those who abuse their authority, but by those who allow the abusers to get away with it (see the systematic sexual abuse of children and the problems the Catholic Church caused itself by concealing it for another case in point).<p>I should add that the Obama Administration&#x27;s conduct would be slightly less galling if it weren&#x27;t part of a pattern, but the fact that James Clapper suffered no consequence for lying to Congress about the NSA&#x27;s constitutional violations means that this is bigger than the CIA.

If the CIA isn&#x27;t properly reporting to the White House, the NSC, and is avoiding oversight by congress, then who the fuck is managing these things? On that same note, what kind of NSC would allow that kind of movement? One that really knows whats going on and approves but doesn&#x27;t want to be seen as complicit is my guess. Otherwise, the director, or more precisely, the AD, would be the main guy &quot;in the know&quot;, but what kind of skeletons does he have and who knows them? What is the real power structure here beyond the official chain of command?<p>How rogue does the Company have to get before someone reigns it in? And with the current state of surveillance, how could any congressmember practically seek to do it?

Scored music &quot;screwed&quot; street performers, then recordings &quot;screwed&quot; concert performers, then the internet &quot;screwed&quot; recording artists.<p>Plenty of artists have successfully adapted and are doing great. Others have sheltered behind curators and promoters like labels. Others have failed to deliver what people want and they are screwed. That&#x27;s capitalism at work.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why we should hold back progress so that existing artists can be sheltered from needing to adapt and provide a product people want to pay for.<p>I say this as a former small-time producer of club tracks and a current software developer.<p>Additionally, you should ask artists who&#x27;s screwing them before you start pointing fingers. Many artists would kill to have their music downloaded. Much of the screwing comes from the big labels that reap almost all of the profits.",1418166088

8726438,comment,8726056,8726306,0,0,jsnell,,,"There are two ways you can sensibly name the publicly visible symbols of a lisp package.<p>One way is to assume that the user won&#x27;t import the package; in this case you&#x27;d probably name your functions and types in very generic ways. For example your HTTP package would have a REQUEST class, which would be referred to from outside the package as HTTP:REQUEST. People trying to import packages written in this style will eventually run into symbol clashes, and resolving those through shadowing is no fun.<p>The other way is to design the package for importing. In this case the HTTP package would have a HTTP-REQUEST class, which would be referred to as HTTP-REQUEST from most places (and as HTTP:HTTP-REQUEST in the few cases where you didn&#x27;t import the package -- but of course you would avoid that because HTTP:HTTP-REQUEST looks ridiculous).<p>So in that sense it&#x27;s totally true that a CL-style package system doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem of name prefixing. It&#x27;s either going to be part of the name, or it will be in the explicit package name that you&#x27;ll end up using to refer to the symbol. But who cares? There are other problems that a flat namespace causes, which would actually be fixed by a package system.",1418166050

One benefit I get from writing, even though I don&#x27;t get a lot of readers, is thought refinement.  I usually send my blog posts to friends and family for help on word choice and better delivery.  Even though Steve Jobs said people don&#x27;t read, I think reading and writing are critical because you don&#x27;t always have a camera or a microphone to get your message across.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://blog.joeblau.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.joeblau.com/</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://github.com/joeblau/gitignore.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joeblau/gitignore.io</a>",1419879599

Many premium cards have higher transaction rates and a merchant is forced to accept all cards of that brand or none.  So no, a credit card is not just a credit card and a debit card is not just a debit card.  That simplification can happen at the 2.9% + $0.30 level, but many of the discounted rates get much more complicated with tiers for various cards -> You are extremely unlikely to get a 1% rate at high volume on a 1.25% cashback card for example.",1419879453

In terms of injury prevention, I&#x27;d agree that the latter is important, but the book chapter doesn&#x27;t have a lot to do with this. All the pictures are of people running better than 5 minutes/mile, with some probably running faster than 4 min/mile. But almost all running injuries are the cumulative effect of lots of slower miles, run at 6, 7, or 8 minutes/mil, or even slower (though the difference between 6 min/mile and 8 min/mile is pretty significant). Good form at those speeds is markedly different.<p>For fun, try to find footage of Kenny Moore running. Looks absurd, so knock kneed, but terrifically fast in his day.",1419879252

I always have a large sketch pad on hand for working out ideas. I think you would benefit from giving yourself design challenges. For me design is about constraints.<p>1. Cut out a random convex pattern from paper and figure how many of that shape you can get from a piece of paper. Then figure out how you would have to alter it or separate it so as to maximize the number of pieces you could get from a single sheet of paper. How many more did you get from the sheet?<p>2. Sketch repeating patterns or scribbles on paper and look for meta patterns or get inspiration from one aspect of the pattern that makes you see something else.<p>3. Estimate how long of a strip of paper you would need to wrap around a cup or a block of legos. Then cut that length out and compare to the actual size to see how well you did. Compare that length to the width or height of the paper you cut it from. Will it divide evenly? Calculate the diameter from the length of the cup wrap or area of the legos.<p>4. Learn to layout true length triangles<p>5. Sketch products interesting to you on paper and consider their size and what shape that material would take if you flattened it out. Can you make it all in one piece? See if you can make small alterations to the dimensions to get more out of the material.<p>6. Take those sketches and try to fit them in a &#x27;golden&#x27; ratio, see how close you came.<p>IMO, learning to find THE meaningful constraints is a key to getting good at design.",1419879096

Facebook does some of both.<p>Indexing is an exercise in denormalization. At the time I post X, the data is also stored in an index keyed by eg every phrase I wrote and maybe even stemmed by synonyms. This makes search fast. It is a memory-time tradeoff which basically precomputes the answer for every query, limited to my feed.<p>As for searching 500 indexes in parallel - this is hardly unreasonable. The alternative -- updating N indexes for every post where N is the number of friends -- is more unreasonable, since it does the maximum amount of work, when the vast majority of it is wasted. No friend is going to search for every single word. On the contrary, some friends will eventually search for a large number of words in YOUR index.<p>Facebook can easily do parallel queries and combine them.

Questions first: how common was it to build your own shelter in the US? Was it something that most people did? Most people talked about? Were the people who built them considered as irrational as people who build &quot;zombie apocalypse&quot; shelters today? Were they stocked with guns the same way that today&#x27;s shelters are?<p>Experience: I grew up in Kharkiv, a city with roughly a 1m population, and the second largest city in Ukraine. Most people lived in large apartment complexes that were organized into planned neighborhoods. Imagine four buildings surrounding a common area that was laid out as a small park. Inside this common area that my building was surrounding were three bomb shelters. We called them &quot;old&quot;, &quot;weird&quot;, and &quot;new&quot; based on their outside appearance. The entrances were fairly small: just a triangle structure with a door and a staircase going down. We never went too deep into them when they were open (the authorities would periodically close them up), but at one point I remember using an iron bar to break the chain on one of them and leading a few of my friends down into it. I really wish we had good flashlights, rope, etc. (we were all around 11 or 12). We went down two levels and looked at these huge rooms. Some of them looked to be set up for bunk beds and it looked like the beds were at some point taken out. I did wander into a random room without a flashlight and almost took a step into a darker area before realizing that it was an opening with a step ladder down to the lower level. I would have been badly hurt had I taken the step before checking. This naturally scared me enough to get out of there in a hurry. The next week this particular shelter was closed up with a better chain so we didn&#x27;t get to go in again.<p>Edit: I tried to find some pictures of what it looked like. Surely someone has taken some photos at one point, but sadly I cannot find anything that resembled the bomb shelters I explored as a child. I do have a strange fascination with the Cold War, so now I really wish I could go back and take some pictures/explore things as an adult.",1419878739

They get the bulk of the fees because they assume all cardholder risks. Besides fraud risk, they also care about the riskiness of the loan to the cardholder.<p>2. Gateway / Third Party Processor. The gateway helps a merchant process some part of the fees(e.g. tokenization, authorizations, settlements, etc.). Generally, they get a smallest percentage of the transaction. Authorize.net or Stripe would be examples of these.<p>3. Merchant&#x27;s bank. They basically buy a merchant&#x27;s credit/debit sales. They get a percentage of the transaction. If your transaction volume is high enough, you can probably convince your bank to lower your rate.<p>4. Visa/MC. Technically, they don&#x27;t get anything. However, banks are required to pay dues in order to offer or process MC or Visa cards.<p>Some other things to note:<p>Online sites often use a Gateway directly and don&#x27;t have a merchant bank. In those cases, the Gateway is acting as both a gateway and a merchant&#x27;s bank.<p>Issuing banks (the bank that gives customers a credit card) charge higher fees for reward cards so that they can provide customers with rewards. Rewards cards are annoying for merchants because one can&#x27;t always tell if a card is a reward card or a regular credit card. Additionally, fees for different rewards are different. These fees can be found in the voluminous fine print in your credit card agreements.",1419878483

There was lots of Q & A, and several frank discussions about funding and what it would require to make our films eligible for sundance or other festivals.

I lived in Humboldt Park next door, right next to Section 8 buildings, and didn&#x27;t have any issues related to the Section 8 folks. I think a more likely explanation is that affluent, rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods attract certain kinds of crime.<p>When I worked at the Chicago Tribune, I covered crime extensively and saw some distinct patterns that coincided with gentrification in Wicker Park: an increased concentration of night time crime, specifically theft and muggings, along Milwaukee avenue. Because crime is down on average, crime definitely did not go up in Wicker Park, but theft, assault, and battery did not go down as quickly as the average in the night life zones. That said, it seems very likely some former public housing residents caused trouble in some of their new neighborhoods.<p>Similarly, I had a petty thief from the projects once tell me that on 35th street, he saw me as either a drug buyer or a do-gooder, but either way it wouldn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to mess with me. But if he saw me in Hyde Park, where I lived at the time, he would have seen me as &quot;prey&quot;. I think it&#x27;s safe to say that to some degree, affluent neighborhoods are targeted by criminals because they are affluent.<p>There are parallels here to mass transit. Minor theft is very high at downtown CTA stations, places with tremendous foot traffic and jostling bodies. It&#x27;s one of the few crime categories that has seen some increase/very little decrease and it seems to track with the widespread use of smartphones.<p>Your comment also gets at some of the really tough questions of social ethics around these issues. For example: is it better to have more petty crime or to incarcerate people at unprecedented rates?<p>None of this stuff is easy, but the ways it is often framed -- like making unsubstantiated causal links between Section 8 and crime -- make the conversation that much harder.<p>(Full disclosure: I&#x27;m the author of the piece)",1419878112

Recall that WWII had involved mass area bombing of civilian targets; many Europeans and Brits were alive in the 50s due to their nations&#x27; bomb shelter programs (I don&#x27;t know about Japan or the Soviets, so I can&#x27;t say there).<p>A nuke isn&#x27;t some magical death-and-destruction device: it&#x27;s just a really powerful bomb, which releases some really nasty pollutants.  It&#x27;s a difference of degree, not of kind: other bombs are weaker and still releases less nasty pollutants.<p>Sure, no home bomb shelter could survive a direct hit; but home shelters weren&#x27;t made to resist direct hits: they were made to resist blast waves from hits on nearby cities; they were made to resist nearby conventional hits.<p>What made them less useful investments was a factor of several things.  Precision targeting made area bombing less likely.  Improved air defenses made large-scale WWII-style bombing raids less likely.  It might also be the case that larger bombs made the risk-reward ratio different.<p>While cleaning out my grandparents&#x27; home a few months ago I came across a government civil defense pamphlet my grandfathers&#x27; firm had republished.

The shelter (or cellar, as it was later called) was always stocked with jams and canned goods, and as kids we would occasionally go down there to play, if we could manage to brave the spiders.<p>The thing I realized as I got older, though, was the psychological impact that the threat of nuclear war had on that generation. My grandmother was not wealthy -- she worked most of her life at the cafeteria of the local high school -- and her husband died when he was in his 30&#x27;s, leaving her to raise 5 children. At some point they decided to spend not-insignificant amounts of money on building a bomb shelter. As I grew up, I realized that this had a subtle but profound impact upon the attitudes of my grandmother and her children: they were all just a little paranoid, careful to the point of it almost seeming neurotic at times. My cousins and I did not share the same fear about the world at large that we witnessed in our parents, and came to believe that this was due to the fact that we grew up in a world where nuclear threats were not so pervasive.<p>It all tied back to the bomb shelter. The mere existence of this cinder block-lined hole in the ground was a daily reminder of what could happen, and what they believed would very likely happen. Many of my aunts and uncles were also prone to believe in the apocalyptic scenario de jure, from upcoming depressions[1] to stockpiling food and water in preparation for Y2K, to more extreme beliefs about race wars and the second coming of Christ.<p>Anyway, this shelter had an impact on me at a young age, but in the opposite direction.

A lot of great comments here but most appear to be missing one key idea: the primary purpose of the infantry rifle is not to kill, it is to suppress. When infantry tactics are properly executed, irrespective of clime and place, most of the actual killing will be done by belt-fed weapons (machine guns such as the M249, M240, MK48) and high explosives (hand grenades, mortars, artillery).<p>If you were to make an analogy to boxing, the M4/M16 is the infantry squad&#x27;s jab, and machine guns and grenades are its power punches. The point of suppression is to keep the enemy&#x27;s head down so that you can both close with him and force him into geometries that make it easier to kill him with more powerful weapons. It is true that a 5.56mm round does not have a lot of stopping power, but it is designed for point-target accuracy up to 600 meters, and a well-maintained M4 with good optics can put rounds through a window (eg, suppress the enemy) at 800 meters. It is also important to note that a 5.56mm NATO round weighs about a third as much as a 7.62mm NATO round; my kit in OIF was about 100 lbs including body armor and would have been around 120 had I been carrying a rifle chambered for 7.62 and the same number of rounds. Also, another important thing to note about stopping power is that anything worth shooting once is worth shooting many times. Stopping power definitely matters when we&#x27;re talking about sniper rifles, less so for an infantryman&#x27;s primary weapons system.<p>With all that said, the M4 is not a great weapon for reasons others have enumerated in these comments. I agree that the HK416 is a beautiful rifle and barring the development of something better should be the primary weapons system for the infantry rifleman, but the procurement / acquisition system is completely screwed up so I&#x27;m not holding my breath waiting for that one to happen.",1419876919

8810953,comment,8810058,8810058,0,0,agwa,,,"It&#x27;s quite interesting to study why crypto_(secret)box requires zero padding. It&#x27;s not to avoid memory allocation, as tedu suggests, but to make the implementation stupidly simple.  For every invocation of crypto_secretbox, NaCl needs to generate a single-use 32 byte key for the Poly1305 MAC.  Since the first 32 bytes of the message are zero, NaCl can simply encrypt the entire message with Salsa20, and the first 32 bytes of the resulting ciphertext conveniently become a suitable key for Poly1305.  (So when the documentation says the padding has to actually be zero, it&#x27;s not kidding.)<p>By making the implementation more complex (some memcpys and special casing of short messages), as libsodium has done for its crypto_secretbox_easy[1], you can avoid the need for this padding.<p>Personally, I think djb should have avoided exposing this implementation detail in the interface.  To simplify the implementation, he could have used the first output block (stream position 0) of Salsa20 only for the Poly1305 key, and then encrypted the message starting with stream position 1, instead of trying to use the first output block for both the Poly1305 key and the message.  The implementation would have been only marginally more complex (not as complex as the libsodium implementation, as you wouldn&#x27;t need special casing).  Unfortunately this can&#x27;t be changed now without breaking interoperability with messages encrypted with the current version of crypto_secretbox.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/17932c782e5900ac8cee42fe43e3455db85351e0/src/libsodium/crypto_secretbox/crypto_secretbox_easy.c#L18-L65"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/17932c782e5900ac8...</a>",1419876657

8810945,comment,8795514,8795514,0,0,holograham,,,"I have seen this problem with my own eyes. My parents own several (small) restaurants and despite my tech background I struggle to get them to to adopt any sort of technology. The main issue is the lack of data/guarantee that making the leap in technology will result in greater sales. Sure a huge chain has smart business execs at the top who are trained in cost/benefit analysis but for the vast majority of small business restaurants the owner is the chef who knows about food and perhaps the local community.<p>For example my father is an extremely talented chef but he didnt own a cell phone or a computer until I bought him one 3 years ago. Yes, 3 years ago! He had run a very successful catering and restaurant operation for ~15 years with pen, paper, and a land line phone. And I am not talking a 50k a year operation -- this is around $1M in revenue. I convinced them a few years back to simplely accept credit cards instead of cash only and their lunch sales increased almost 50%. I pushed them to pay for yelp local advertising (after years of resistance) and their sales went up almost 20%. Next I am working on them adopting integrated point of sale registers and integrating them with loyalty cards. I think the cost savings + increased loyalty is game for another 10-20% profit increase. The overall point being that small to medium size restaurants are woefully behind the times and are extremely slow to adopt new technology. I have kicked around a startup idea focused on collating and seemlessly making restaurants like this be able to move into the 21st century. The problem to solve here is creating software to scale so it&#x27;s not simply a consulting company.",1419876568

8810896,comment,8808427,8810607,0,0,exabrial,,,"6.8mm SPC is an incredible cartridge. It&#x27;s far superior to .300 AAC in range and terminal effects. It offers a wide variety of loads including an effective subsonic load. There are a few quibbles about efficiencies (powder and materials): The standard infantrymen doesn&#x27;t really need long range cartridge.<p>However, the big reason I wouldn&#x27;t suggest 6.8mm as an upgrade to the 5.56mm is the upgrade path is more expensive. While the 6.8mm _can_ work with the standard buffer tube spring, it&#x27;s best those get upgraded for accuracy and shooter comfort. The 6.8mm requires a new bolt and barrel in the upper receiver. The 6.8mm also requires new magazines (to be used at full capacity). The 6.8mm requires new brass and new loading dies, so your ammo production lines have to change significantly. Finally, the chamber pressure increase in the 6.8mm may introduce reliability issues in certain models of the AR15, especially in the gas impingement system. And personally, I the recoil from the 6.8mm kinda sucks.<p>The .300 AAC requires _merely_ a barrel swap. Everything else in the upper is compatible. The brass from 5.56mm can be cut down to make .300 AAC brass (yay for recycling) and existing loading dies can be used to load .300 AAC. The existing magazines can be used at full capacity.<p>While the 6.8mm may be a superior round, I think the .300 AAC wins in terms of practicality. Just my opinion :)",1419876025

We give it to children to make them sit still, and many adults take it, too.<p>There are some analogs, like Methylphenidate, which are said to be less addictive, but many people prefer, and use Adderall, which isn&#x27;t, and both are deemed to be safe enough to give to children in small doses.

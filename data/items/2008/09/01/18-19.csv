It's absolutely necessary that we have competition but it's way too easy to dilute the market.<p>It's like the problem of too much choice. We all face it. We go to the store and are greeted with 10 slightly different versions of the same product. Mint toothpaste, mint with extra-whitening, mint-flavored baking soda toothpaste. I don't want to buy one that tastes bad. This stuff <i>is</i> going in my mouth 3x a day, after all.\nSo I'm confused and cranky because I just want my normal toothpaste. My brain remembers the box had the certain logo and the certain white swish of box art. Found it! What size, big or small? Done, continue on to shopping decisions I actually want to think about like what's for dinner.<p>These days, the choice of a browser by 90% of people is the same kind of commodity thought given to toothpaste. They know what they're familiar with. They identify it via the shape and color of the icon, and maybe whether it says ""internet"" or not.<p>We've had to take 4 years to push Firefox to ~20% marketshare. Internet Explorer still has 75% total, with 30% of that being IE6. Safari, Opera, and all other browsers squeeze into the rough remaining 5% of the market. Adding YAB to the party won't serve anything except to dilute the last 5% some more.<p>What we need is <i>not</i> new browsers, OSS or not. We need marketing. Microsoft had easy marketing for IE. An icon on the desktop called ""Internet"".<p>We need Apple-style ads with Jason Long as Firefox and John Hodgeman as Internet Explored. Boil the message down to the barest essentials of the message and make it as clear to the ""other 90%"" as the Big Blue E meant ""internet"".",1220292860

I wonder if the nytimes would try to turn that into a scandal.

292035,comment,291924,292002,0,0,peakok,,,"I would argue that there is indeed some kind of ""color affinity"", if we don't want to call it color intelligence. My father is a painter, and at some workshops people often asked him how to get some specific color or another. He told me that it was a problem he didn't understood, because he never encountered it even when he started painting. Colors just come easily to him, in a intuitive way, he never had to read theory about it.<p>To me, there is some parallelism with the guys who are gifted at math or logic : there are a lot of things that come intuitively to them where others have to struggle. The difference is that we are more prone to call them smart than people with other sort of abilities (musicians, painters, etc.).",1220292653

Perhaps the best way to counteract this impression, and to help to get the atomic bomb to scale, is to consider the numbers of atomic bombs that would have to be dropped on this country and on Germany to have caused the same total amount of damage as was actually caused by attacks with high explosive and incendiary bombs.<p>‘During the last war a total of 1,300,000 tons [i.e. 1.3 MEGATONS of bombs] were dropped on Germany by the Strategic Air Forces [of Britain and America]. If there were no increase in aiming accuracy, then to achieve the same amount of material damage (to houses, industrial and transportational targets, etc.) would have required the use of over 300 atomic bombs together with some 500,000 tons of high explosive and incendiary bombs for targets too small to warrant the use of an atomic bomb</i>",1220292483

292031,comment,291855,291867,0,0,RobGR,,,"I think you are missing the important part of this idea, probably because Seth wrote way too many words for something that could be compressed into a paragraph with an hour or two of  careful editing.<p>Of course you can get the idea that people who like one thing also like another from Amazon -- but Seth's senario presumed you knew that already.  The problem is, figuring out WHO those people are that like both bands, particularly, the people who like both bands but don't know about your band to like it yet.<p>The fact that there is an intersection of sets is easy to come across or guess, the actual MEMBERS of the sets are hard to find.<p>Seth's idea seems like a good one to me because it fits the general pattern, that many good computer revolution ideas allow small people to do what huge companies, institutions, or governments were already doing.  Putting the ""desktop"" in desktop publishing, personal computers with spreadsheets replacing custom code on mainframes, ebay replacing the Sears catalog, etc.<p>Previously, the information of who these people were who bought CDs of band A and might like band B was available only to the big distributors.  But since ebay, half.com, and amazon's used section allow us small guys to be distributors also, now we on a small scale can get access to that information too.<p>I don't have any product that I can use to make use of this idea now, but I'm going to keep it in my bag of tricks.",1220292032

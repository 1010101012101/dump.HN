So many investors have told me that they want nothing to do with the music industry (streaming rights especially are not too attractive a proposition) and won't fund anything. On the other hand, they don't want to be the ones to miss a gold mine because they are stuck in thinking from 10 years ago about an evolving industry. If Turntable can do one thing, I would hope it would be to help foster a more creative community around music application creation. Having that community have the blessing of the music industry themselves would be the ultimate goal along with changing the licensing structure for developers (David Isrealite of the NMPA talked about this here: <a href=""http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/others/president-of-nmpa-calls-for-blanket-licensing-1005238782.story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/others/president-of-nmpa-call...</a>).

2739246,story,,,2,0,dad1979,"Quid pro quo",,"I would like to think that exchanging and sharing are an intrinsic part of our nature.
In medieval times, for example, the lord would provided security to their servants against marauders in exchange of work and loyalty.
Today, lots and things have changed. Lots of things remain the same.
Every time we surf the Internet we take and we give. We enjoy good designs (UI/UX), we are able to share lots of things, we are able to express ourselves. In return, we test apps (knowingly or not), we provided market research by being free test subjects, we submitted our personal information, etc.
They give us something. We give then something. We need each other.
They can build their multi billion dollar enterprise; in return, we can share files, photos, feelings, etc.
Give us what we want and we shall follow. BUT we are not theirs to keep.
FB gives as an ethereal place to chat, interact and do stuff BUT in return they can have a huge database with our personal information. With that information they do their business selling adds, etc. (provided some rules regarding confidentiality). Quid pro quo.
Thats the way things work. We all get what we want  most of the time ;).
The problem is that we are not theirs to keep. Myspace.com is the best example of that.
We are free to decide what and how we want to be.
Thats why we have the right to suicide our account, if we think thats the way to go. If the web does not recognize that right we will quit it and there is nothing about it no one can do.
If we prefer Google+ instead of FB, I think that they should not try to make the migration harder. Give us something better and we will be there.
When you start to control people by force instead of seducing their free will your are starting a very dangerous slippery slope.",1310057833

The thing with video chat is people simply don't want to use it, at least not a lot.
Many have been pushing different forms of video chatting for so many years already. It's really not about the technology behind it, people just don't like it that much.<p>Sure, Hangouts are great. I think that's the best implementation of a video chat I have ever seen. Might even want to try it out. But I definitely won't be using it on a daily basis. And customer support using web cams would be a nightmare. In 5-10-15 year perhaps people will perhaps change the way they want to overact over the internet, but for now most like to hide behind their text.<p>So it's all nice, but 'the next generation of ecommerce' as a result of a great video chat technology? I guess you're pushing it. Big time.<p>Google Hangouts might be the first serious step to going beyond text-based communication. But most likely it will be the ideas made on top or around it that will bring about a real change. I think what Hangouts can do is make people actually like video chat a little.",1310057655

There was a batch of interesting people: only one of them would sit in front of a desktop and all 38 would line up around him, despite terminals being available for all of them. Now, this guy is trying to type ""dir /s"" and while hitting the Spacebar a question pops in his mind: ""Why do you need to hit the Spacebar with thumb?""
I started thinking about how it is more efficient to hit the Spacebar with thumb, the notion of finger travel in miles per annum etc., while my friend replied curtly to that 55 year old student: ""Sir, do you start your Scooter by hitting the `kick' by foot or by palm?"" He gulped the tobacco he was chewing up.<p>During that year, I rolled out a desktop application in a smallish organization and was astonished to meet users who were typists-turned-computer-operators. I couldn't grasp as to why they found my code to be so user-friendly.

I have been a dropbox user for a while, and while I love it - I think that Drew may be missing a HUGE opportunity of not (yet) realizing that dropbox is a potentially game changing platform.<p>Hear me out:<p>I have dropbox on my phone and my machines. I travel for work and incur expenses, gather project/client data, write proposals, share files with team, etc..<p>In one task, expense reports, when I get a receipt, I take a pic of it with my phone and upload to my expenses receipts folder in dropbox to submit.<p>When I want to immediately share proposal drafts, pictures from travel/client sites etc.. I upload the pics or place the files in shared folders with others on my team.<p>This works beautifully, but is very rudimentary as well.<p>The files arrive in their views as expected - but its then no different than flat data.<p>I would like to see DropBox as a platform, where utility apps that take advantage of dead simple file and data transfer.<p>Imagine an app that sat on top of dropbox and connected to it directly which allowed a more elegant data and photo sharing. With the ability to chat among users as well and keep revision control of documents between users.<p>This would work in the following way, lets call them DropChannels:<p>You create a DropChannel by placing a piece of content for sharing and inviting other users to it.<p>I post a pic, and say I want USER1 and USER3 to see it. They are notified of a new Channel and see the pic. They can reply in kind with a message (chat reply, like ""Looks good - go ahead"" etc), which gets archived into the channel's log file.<p>They can reply with a pic of their own, which ends up in the channels' pics dir.<p>Or they reply with a document, which is viewable in the same way current docs are viewable - but they get placed in the channel's docs folder.<p>Each channel is defined based on a topic, and all activity in that channel is archived in the channels folder which is synced between al lthe users in the channel.<p>The important thing is to allow chatting, collaboration and input from other users.<p>Allow a team to select a channel template, which will include a range of directories or files that can be tracked for a channel. For example, you could have the app have a tab for time tracking, which can be slid over to, data entered and that data is captured in a time tracking file for later billing.<p>Scheduling etc...<p>All based on the dropbox syncing API as a platform...",1310057138

Technically if I come to hacker news and someone has posted 5 out of 7 paragraphs from an AP news article in a comment, that is a copyright violation. Under the principles outlined, the poster and perhaps all the readers could end up being blacklisted from internet access, which for many people who use the internet to work would result in unemployment and homelessness. I know the response will be ""don't be silly we would never do that for a small infraction"" but who don't really know that at all.

Hubble is a relic of an old technological age.   Earth-based telescopes surpassed Hubble's capabilities not too long after it was launched, and have now pretty much left it in the dust.  At a fraction of the cost.<p>Hubble's replacement (James Webb) is quite a leap ahead, and as an IR scope it really does need to be in space, unlike Hubble.  But you'll note that its location will be off-limits to humans, and it is accordingly designed to be remotely maintained.<p>In short, the age of low-earth-orbit, high-maintenance space telescopes is, and should be, over.  I argue that other space-based platforms that require human intervention should likewise be curtailed for similar reasons.<p>>""Automation isn't cheap, missions that have to be redone because the automation fails are costly.""<p>It is still orders of magnitude cheaper than sending people, and the cost of a ""failed"" space endeavour with people on board is infinitely greater.  In cases where it's not currently feasible to use robots, it would be worth our while to wait until it is, instead of trying to use humans now.<p>I feel that Mars is another example in my favor.  Cost estimates for sending humans to Mars are so high and so speculative that they're essentially useless outside of the insight that we cannot afford it.

</code></pre>
This is just an uninformed opinion. Mono is just better for desktop applications and games, in all ways that count.<p>Performance wise, Mono is much more predictable. The VM starts faster and doesn't need special warmup. If you don't like the VM, you can always compile ahead-of-time. It has stack-allocated values, unsigned integers and if you're inclined you can always come up with your own special 256-bit integers that are still stack allocated.<p>I wrote lots of data processing scripts this last year and Mono had better performance characteristics than Java. And that's before I tried plugging in Mono.SIMD which totally blew me away.<p>Writing bindings to C/C++ libraries using P/Invoke is a piece of cake. That's because Mono has richer primitives; in ""unsafe"" blocks of code you can even have pointers and pointer arithmetic.<p>For desktop apps you can create native interfaces with GTK+ on Gnome, Windows Forms / WPF on Windows and Cocoa on OS X. I mean, the bindings for GTK and Cocoa are state of the art as far as bindings go and on Windows .NET is just native.<p>And some people scoff at the idea of building a specific interface for each platform, but I never seen a Java desktop application that I haven't found nauseating.

Definitely less bright than the halogens, but these are areas that we leave on all night outside or for about 6 hours inside. They're expensive, but I calculate that the outside ones will pay themselves off in about 6 months and the inside bulbs 20 months. This excludes replacing the halogens, which happened relatively often. We still have many other down-lighters indoors, but they're not on very often and need to be dimmed, so I'll wait until the cost drops.",1310054565

Right now Facebook has a valuation of about 80 billion, and a userbase of about 750 million.

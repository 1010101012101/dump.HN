8709304,comment,8706850,8708711,0,0,ska,,,"The point is that the concentration of energy in lower frequencies (i.e. the reason you see sparseness in the wavelet domain) is separable from the issue of using IFS.  After all, using IFS means you encode an operator, not the signal.<p>One way to demonstrate this (which was shown around the time of Davis&#x27;s paper, if I recall correctly) is to do the IFS codec in the wavelet domain hierarchically (on quadtrees in the case of an orthonormal wavelet basis).  This gives you a similar advantage of spending your encoder bits (which should still be handled by an entropy coder, regardless of method) primarily get spent where the image energy is, but does not truncate information as hard as, say, a zerotree approach.<p>The problems Davis points out with IFS codecs done on blocks in the spatial domain are issues with block/patch operations and with operating in the spatial domain, not with IFS per se.<p>The fundamental idea behind IFS codecs is that you encode a transform whose fixed point approximates your signal, you don&#x27;t encode the signal directly.<p>The real problem is the difficulty in embedding them, and the need to iterate a few times to converge the result.. which is what you allude to I think.<p>[note, I really should revisit Davis&#x27;s paper before discussing , because I&#x27;m operating from memory here...]",1417877892

What you address is architecture.<p>What we basically did is we have one XSL file for each &quot;element&quot;. Elements are: button, image, headline, etc. Each of those elements inputs &quot;our own&quot; XML syntax with wisely chosen defaults (some HTML attributes like class,id,style get just passed through) and outputs Twitter Bootstrap HTML. Writing responsive websites in our framework is extremely easy. So each element has a XSL file where the magic happens, an XML file with documentation and tests and additional files like scass/css/js files with the same name. Accessing them is extremely easy when you use something like Sublime Text (what we all do).<p>All those different templates get written into just one XSL file automatically with the help of node.js&#x27; gulp.<p>The website gets delivered in Apache Cocoon which has a pipeline concept similar to gulp. Once a page got rendered, it is cached until the next update (except for pages with dynamic content of course).<p>The whole frameworks documentation is basically a website written in this framework with automated tests.<p>We use XSLT 1.0 + EXSLT and have written around 30 (EXSLT) functions to make sure everything works like we expect.<p>Everybody in our team loves it.",1417877426

8709279,comment,8704303,8709069,0,0,Silhouette,,,"HMRC will tell you whether <i>in their opinion</i> you are caught by IR35. However, it is important to understand that they are not a neutral advisor, and just because someone at HMRC thinks you are caught, that does not mean the actual decision-making process if they challenge your status will lead to the same conclusion. In reality, they have a record of chasing not very many people under IR35 in the first place and then winning only a fraction of those cases when someone has put up a fight.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not arguing that this is necessarily due to any ill intent on their part. It&#x27;s just that even if HMRC people are trying to help when you call them, they can still fail to understand what the tax rules actually say and they can give incorrect advice as a result. When that happens, they seem to err on the side of saying you&#x27;re caught by whatever it is you&#x27;re asking about and should pay the extra tax.<p>If I&#x27;d taken them at their word the last couple of times I called, my companies would have paid far more tax than we really owed. (To be clear again, I&#x27;m not talking about any funny tax avoidance measures here, just applying the normal but somewhat complicated rules for things like international sales.)

It saddens me when the XML-hating JSON community starts reinventing solutions that have all the same issues of bloat and complexity (see JSON schema, Collection+JSON, Siren, etc).<p>JSON schema:<p>Validing schemas is not as nearly important for JSON as it is for XML. JSON&#x27;s relative simplicity the problem of &quot;almost-but-not-quite&quot; valid encoding mostly goes away.<p>As a result, not many people use JSON schema.<p>Even when I work with XML I very rarely come across code that performed actual XML validation. Most people would just wing it and hope nothing broke. That&#x27;s the first dirty secret of XML validation.<p>The second dirty secret is that if you are consuming an API that provides invalid XML (a common occurrence), you just deal with it and try to make it work. XML validity be damned.<p>Collection+JSON:<p>Literally never heard of this. Don&#x27;t need it either.

When I joined, it was kind of a mess and I had a hard time understanding XSLT and the templates written.<p>Just recently I had the chance to do a rewrite. What I did is I created &quot;my own HTML&quot;. Basically every module of Twitter Bootstrap has it&#x27;s own XSLT template. That means you have a very easy XML &quot;HTML&quot; syntax, but the output is Twitter Bootstrap. And every piece of output HTML is defined just once in the whole application so it&#x27;s easy to maintain.<p>With the help of XSLT you can abstract a lot of things. One example: I have an element called <colgroup/>. It can contain up to 12 <col/> elements. if I set the @size attribute to one of the columns, the @size attribute for the others will be calculated automatically and the output matches the Twitter Bootstrap CSS classes.<p>I have to say, I love it.

I&#x27;m surprised to see the above statement in a press release; maybe it was not worded quite right. At the scale of 100s of thousands, or a millions of transactions a day, &quot;some risk&quot; will manifest itself on operation timescales itself. So when one is &quot;not certain&quot; it&#x27;s always best to assume that problems will show up and it will take less time than expected.<p><pre><code>  &quot;We are still investigating the triggers for this consensus failure, but believe it is caused by the innate weaknesses of the Ripple/Stellar consensus system outlined above compounded by the number of accounts in the network.&quot;

Also not great wording. Saying the system had &quot;innate weaknesses&quot; and we &quot;believe&quot; kind of implies engineers are still guessing on the trigger. Your building a financial corporation and if you lose you loose everything",1417875002

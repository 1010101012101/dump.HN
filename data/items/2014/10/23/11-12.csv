It took about 6 months to get to the level of vocabulary that Mark is using, and another 6 months to get to the point where I could handle a job interview.<p>Mandarin syntax is surprisingly easy, with no articles or weird things like irregular verbs or messy conjugations. The tones throw people off, and the written characters are extremely difficult to learn (for Westerners; Japanese, who have exposure to Chinese characters, do quite well at reading and writing). Fortunately, there is a Romanization/phonetic system called <i>pinyin</i> that makes it quite easy to get started with pronunciation and tones.<p>Yes, Mark is speaking with a very heavy accent and needs to work on his tones. But the fact that Mark was able to get to this level without living in China (he says he’s only visited 4 times, although it sounds like he’s able to practice with family members, including his wife’s paternal grandmother) is very impressive. I think it would be fair for many Chinese citizens to ask, if the busy CEO of a major American company who seldom visits China can learn Mandarin, why do many foreign businesspeople who have lived in China for years fail to learn the language?",1414065232

Also, why the hell would anyone have thought to do this in the past? I work in testing and no one creates a QC process to check for fakes during the PCBA process.

Options are always LESS valuable than the underlying asset. The degree to which they are less valuable is inversely correlated to their volatility. The more volatile they are, the closer in value they are to their underlying asset.<p>I.e. a January 2015 call for Apple is currently trading at $4.36 per share. That means despite apple shares being worth $103 each, you can buy options for $4.36 each. If you want a longer term you can pay a bit more. A January 2017 call for Apple is $16.65, still more than 5 times cheaper than the actual share.<p>What employees get are more like options on the options. This secondary option multiplies the value of the option as you have described, but it also presents really awkward conflicts of interest where employees often end up with their shares reduced or being pushed out of the company altogether (see Skype or Zynga). Even still, it&#x27;s not clear whether this multiplicative value of the option ever makes it worth more than the underlying stock. It could just make it similar.",1414064139

I&#x27;m left with a broken OS at the end.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is an issue of having a more sophisticated package management.<p>OS X and Windows are basically huge software bundles that are dropped on a drive. They rarely change their internal structure gradually (Windows takes an odd middleground of basically keeping all patches around). It&#x27;s a well understood process and easy to reason about: copy bunch of data A to location B, make sure it matches a checksum. Ship some parts in double in different versions, to support older versions. All the issues I ever had with that were with all the packages software I handbuilt on top of that.<p>OSes fully built on packaging software from ground up, e.g. apt, rely on the assumption that the package tree is always problem-free and that you can migrate any custom evolution of that tree to a new standard version. While this works formidably for smaller changes (I just want to add a package), where the potential breakage is contained to a rather limited set of packages, possibly close to the leafs of the tree, this gets problematic if you want to change a package on the top of the tree.<p>I think this gives a lot of power to the approach of immutable machines, combining both approaches: fine-grained dependency-tracking and resolution, while avoiding the evolutionary problems by always rebuilding the system from ground up on any change.<p>FWIW: I love a proper package management. But I don&#x27;t believe in its infallibility.",1414062900

So after briefly trying desktop unity in 12.04 I switched my development machine to Fedora with Xfce and XMonad. Now I only use Ubuntu on the occasional virtual machine for testing, but I may try running it on my touch ultrabook some day.",1414062445

It&#x27;s also by far the most popular Linux distro for a lot&#x27;s of reasons. Although i rarely use it at home (switched to OSX) I still keep myself updated and try every release. \nImho i feel they should get more in the &quot;latest technologies&quot; bandwagon like they did a few years before Unity (for those who remember Ubuntu pushed always the latest GNOME releases with the latest technologies developed by RedHat and get it right even before Fedora) and upstart in order to not cause more fragmentation on the Linux desktop. \nLet&#x27;s take Unity example: First was desktop on top of GTK2 which looked and worked better than gnome-shell. Then the transition of GNOME3 started and now GNOME was able to get a ecosystem of applications that fit&#x27;s on GNOME not Unity, so currently GNOME apps don&#x27;t fit on Unity desktop and even gnome-shell perhaps it&#x27;s more useful than Unity.\nSame for upstart: It started as an new modern init system but then systemd came out and become the standard in Linux (or at least it&#x27;s trying to). Now Ubuntu is migrating to systemd because their init system never gained traction. Not to mention the manpower they invested and now they don&#x27;t get any result out of it.\nI fear the same will happen with MIR since it will NOT become the standard on Linux like Wayland.<p>For the future I hope Canonical don&#x27;t pull the plug on Desktop and Server (which is also very popular) and give it&#x27;s users the choice of using Wayland, GNOME, X11, systemd, XFCE, LXDE or other technologies instead of the &quot;home made&quot; technologies. Also let&#x27;s hope for more bright 10 years ahead trying to get Linux Desktop in the right direction giving people a choice between Operating Systems.",1414062334

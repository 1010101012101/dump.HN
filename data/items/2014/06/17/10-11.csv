It has you wear glasses that are the opposite of those you&#x27;ve been subscribed, or that are significantly less strong, and using them while actively trying to focus at the edge of blur, e.g. by reading a book and keeping it far enough away so it&#x27;s ever so slightly blurry but not too blurry either, forcing your eyes to clear the image. It&#x27;s not clear why it works – do your eyes actually start changing their shape, or is it simply the eye muscles that get stronger? – but if you&#x27;re willing to put in the months and months of effort it requires, for many it does help.<p>See <a href=""http://gettingstronger.org/2010/07/improve-eyesight-and-throw-away-your-glasses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettingstronger.org/2010/07/improve-eyesight-and-thro...</a>",1403002654

I do wonder about his characterisation of <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>: he seems to be saying it&#x27;s only good for showing philosophy students that philosophical ideas are duff, whereas I think it has more value in showing that ideas most people carry around in the back of their heads (like: &quot;there is such a thing as <i>the</i> meaning of a word&quot;) are duff, and maybe working towards disinfection of the collective psyche in that regard. Also, it&#x27;s not quite as out-of-kilter with the Tractatus as implied. The Tractatus itself was aimed at ruling a lot of metaphysical theorising as out-of-court. Philosophical Investigations does revise the approach substantially, but shares some of the goals of the earlier work.<p>Maybe the most enjoyable thing, though, was the complete lack of any false modesty on the part of the interviewee:<p>> I can do psychology [...] far better than the best psychologist like Daniel Kahneman, who hasn’t been trained up in philosophy.

To be clear, Cap&#x27;n Proto allows you to add new fields to a message without breaking backwards compatibility, and Cap&#x27;n Proto implements default values.<p>The question is how a field is represented on the wire if it&#x27;s defined in the schema but you don&#x27;t assign it a value before serializing. With FlatBuffers, it won&#x27;t take any space on the wire (although it still takes space in the vtable, but that can be amortized with many instances of the same structure). With Cap&#x27;n Proto, all fields are located at fixed offsets from the start of the struct, therefore they take space even if they aren&#x27;t set. You can truncate unused fields off the end, but not from the middle.<p>Also, note that Cap&#x27;n Proto uses pointers for variable-width fields. The pointer can be null if the field is not set. So the maximum wasted space for an unset field is 8 bytes, all of which are zero and therefore compress nicely.<p>Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s approach is exactly the approach used by in-memory data structures in C, C++, and all other high-performance programming languages. If your C struct contains a field you don&#x27;t use, it still takes space in memory. I would think this would be preferable for games.",1403000477

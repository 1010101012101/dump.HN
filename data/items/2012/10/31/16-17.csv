However, eventually I would like to see us gather some useful information from it. Think of my metric as performing an experiment.

When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.[a] 2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 3 I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling. 4 My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirits power, 5 so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on Gods power.<p>Gods Wisdom Revealed by the Spirit<p>6 We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 7 No, we declare Gods wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 However, as it is written:<p>What no eye has seen,\n    what no ear has heard,\nand what no human mind has conceived[b]\n    the things God has prepared for those who love him<p>10 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.<p>The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11 For who knows a persons thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12 What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.[c] 14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 15 The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, 16 for,<p>Who has known the mind of the Lord\n    so as to instruct him?[d]<p>But we have the mind of Christ.<p>-------------------------------<p>5 When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. 6 Be careful, Jesus said to them. Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<p>7 They discussed this among themselves and said, It is because we didnt bring any bread.<p>8 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? 9 Do you still not understand? Dont you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 10 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 11 How is it you dont understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 12 Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<p>----<p>I think of the origin as a valley because in control theory you drive it to zero.

Once ConEd lost power to Lower Manhattan, Datagram's emergency systems kicked on maintaining power to Datagram's datacenter. Unfortunately, within a couple hours of the storm hitting Manhattan's shores, the building's entire basement, which houses the building's fuel tank pumps and sump pumps, was completely filled with water and a few feet into the lobby. Due to electrical systems being underwater the building was forced to shut down to avoid fire and permanent damage.""<p>It's pretty obvious that, despite all the disaster planning done in the past, Datagram (and TEPCO, and others) have really neglected to appreciate the potential modes of failure for their backup power systems. In both cases, they misunderstood the threat to critical backup power infrastructure.

4723546,comment,4721423,4721647,1,0,rbabich,,,"There are a couple of (related) reasons.  The first thing to recognize is that systems such as this one are designed for parallel workloads where all processes are running in lockstep, communicating via MPI with frequent barriers.  This is very different from MapReduce and other asynchronous or ""embarrassingly parallel"" workloads where GFS, HDFS, etc. tend to be used.  Distributed filesystems used in high-performance computing (such as Lustre, IBM's GPFS, etc.) also have to be able to handle both reads and writes with high throughput, whereas GFS is mostly optimized for reads and appends.<p>Why not just install disks in the compute nodes and run Lustre there?  Since all the nodes are working together in lockstep, system jitter is a major problem.  Imagine that you have a job running across 10,000 nodes and 160,000 cores, and a process on one of those cores get preempted for a millisecond while a disk I/O request is being serviced.  Everyone waits, and you've suddenly wasted 160 core-seconds.  Now, if this happens only 1000 times per second across the whole machine, it's clear that you're not going to make much forward progress, and the whole system is going to run at very low efficiency.  For this reason, Crays and similar large machines run a very minimal OS on the compute nodes (a linux-based ""compute node kernel"" in the case of Cray).  Introducing local disks would go against the whole philosophy.<p>There's also the issue of network contention.  The network is typically the bottleneck, and you want to minimize the extent to which file I/O competes with your MPI traffic.<p>As someone else mentioned, the solution is to have a dedicated storage system (often Lustre running on a semi-segregated cluster).  This approach is used almost universally by the 500 systems on the Top 500 list (<a href=""http://top500.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://top500.org</a>), for example.

FC or iSCSI attached) dumb block device without any special understanding of the filesystem, which is exact opposite of using local hard drives of the nodes.<p>Things like Lustre or GoogleFS use distributed storage nodes that are normally separate from client nodes.<p>While in both cases nothing prevents you from running both client applications and storage server process on same node there is little reason to do so, for both operational (disks are in one place) and economic reasons (attaching 20 disks to one node is cheaper than attaching 20 disks to 20 nodes).<p>In fact few years ago I've actively searched for filesystem with built-in redundancy and storage capacity distributed across client nodes and found almost nothing that was designed for such use case.<p>Only thing I'm aware of that was close to what you propose is/was essentially an wrapper for NFS in (open)MOSIX, that was able to redirect I/O from process to local disk when it found out that it was migrated to same node as NFS server runs on. With the important note that (open)MOSIX  is not exactly meaningful HPC solution, but interesting nevertheless.",1351699769

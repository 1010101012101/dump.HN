9096598,comment,9096321,9096321,0,0,flohofwoe,,,"I think this is the first emscripten feature which I don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot;, e.g. not fully understanding the motivation behind it :) Firefox AOT compile time is great, and nothing at all compared to the time it takes to download the code. The real art lies in getting the actual emscripten compiled executable small, not because of emscripten, but because of C++&#x27;s tendency to bloat the executable size if one isn&#x27;t really careful. Also, clang and emscripten&#x27;s code generation passes have very aggressive dead code elimination, but there can be wrong decisions on the game engine architecture-level which can cause the inclusion of code that might never be called. A native executable that&#x27;s several dozen MByte&#x27;s big is a bad thing on any platform, it just doesn&#x27;t appear as such a problem if it is a part of a 50 GByte game download. To come to and end, I think an emscripten client of up to 5 MByte (gzipped) doesn&#x27;t really require a fix like emterpreter for its startup time(?), and it&#x27;s perfectly possible to fit a full 3D game client into such a size with a little care about size optimization.<p>[edit: fixed a formulation which sounded like code bloat can be blamed on emscripten instead of user-code]",1424721588

I had done a test-run months before. I realized I could end my life and get off the track that just seemed to produce misery and dissatisfaction for me and those around me.  And then I realized I could just stop. I could use my life only for me, for what I valued, how I wanted to live.  I could get off life&#x27;s treadmill. I could do it by killing myself, or I could just step off and live whatever crazy idiot foolish life I wanted. I can always go back to that building and jump.  And I&#x27;ve thought about doing it more than a few times over the years.  But the reality is I can quit life and start over, or build a life the way I think it should be. my life doesn&#x27;t have to work, it doesn&#x27;t have to conform to anyone else&#x27;s standards or conditions.<p>I&#x27;m not an idiot though. We live in a world where people react and do things.  Life is kind of like Groundhog Day. We can weave through it in all sorts of ways.   And when I&#x27;m feeling persistently useless and worthless I start to think about how to end that.  and then I think, oh yeah.  I can change how I live, even radically.  that useless worthless feeling is a clue telling me to change how I&#x27;m living. (it&#x27;s also a clue to go to the tanning salon).   There is no &quot;right way&quot; to live a life.  There is just living life. And if life sucks, we are free to change things.  And I have found dreaming big, swinging for the fences, trying the impossible, dying (or living) for a crazy idea is a better alternative than a short leap.<p>So before making that leap I asked myself what would I rather do? And I didn&#x27;t go to school that day. I did go to my job at KFC before returning to my roach infested apartment.  My grandpa gave good advice:  &quot;Always run towards things.&quot; But sometimes you have to move away from something to get the freedom to change direction.  Suicide just doesn&#x27;t let you get to that change direction part.<p>I aslo believe that learning to meditate in the library while sluffing class in HS helped me to gain a little distance between my consciousness and my problems. Practicing meditation is particularly hard when depressed but it does seem to open a space of freedom between the emotions of depression and oneself.

A lot less. In fact their very perception of what constituted &quot;frequent&quot; interaction plummeted from several times a day to a few times a week. And it happened in scheduled meetings whereas it was more ad hoc in an open plan office.<p>They also noted something very interesting: we tend to prioritize our own personal productivity over team productivity, probably because most of us are compensated and promoted based on personal accomplishments.<p>You can see why management struggles with balancing these two objectives in space design. I think most of the comments here are very cynical but not very well reasoned. They tend to have not very well thought through conspiracy theories, like architecture firms wanting smaller spaces (what?) or pinning it all on cost cutting. Cost cutting? Businesses pay engineers HUGE salaries; if there was clear evidence that a given office plan was significantly less productive it would logically be a huge <i>waste</i> of money to put their highly paid employees in it.<p>The reality is there is a balance of individual and team productivity that organizations need to achieve. We have learned a lot about the drawbacks to purely private office layouts (like lower team collaboration and depressingly poor social interaction).

Does it stand up in light of the Bell test<p>In &quot;normal&quot; quantum mechanics we have the wave-particle dualism. A particle behaves also like a wave, whatever that means.<p>In Bohm&#x27;s hidden variable theory, also known as &quot;pilot wave theory&quot; the wave and the particles are separate. The pilot wave is a wave of unknown making (the theory does not say what it would be made of), and this wave follows the normal quantum mechanical behaviour. Then particles &quot;ride&quot; on this wave. So all the quantum mechanical wave effects happen in the pilot wave, and then the classical particle-like particles just follow theirs paths, already laid out by the wave.<p>Although &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; is also experimentally verified, explaining this by postulating a wave that fills the whole universe, and explicitly reacts spookily over distances, makes the whole &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; uncomfortable explicit in this theory, so it doesn&#x27;t appeal to most physicists.<p><i>&quot;The de Broglie–Bohm theory makes the same (empirically correct) predictions for the Bell test experiments as ordinary quantum mechanics. It is able to do this because it is manifestly nonlocal.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory#Quantum_entanglement.2C_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_paradox.2C_Bell.27s_theorem.2C_and_nonlocality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory#...</a>",1424719260

For many people on H1B&#x27;s the visa and greencard sponsoring has tremendous value. The do depress wages, but it&#x27;s because of the risk around the visas.<p>If you have an H1B, you&#x27;re less likely to work at startups -- if the company goes bust and you need to find a job fast, you&#x27;re at tremendous risk of needing to leave the US.

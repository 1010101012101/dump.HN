So instead of spending another 8 months hiring those 360 guys, they should instead transfer those 200 to some kinda special service review team directly interacting with customers and doing those weird tests they often do for color shades (just pick random people and ask whats kinda painful to use their service).<p>P.S: It would be a lot better if they also had a 'human' review team to review banned accounts. This would eliminate the errors made by the algorithms. Since the industry standard for fraud is just around 1.5% the review team should be able to handle it easily.",1238302539

537115,comment,536718,536718,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"Here's a summary of the ""experiment"":<p><pre><code>  * hook 24 college students to brain-scanner-majigs.
  * given them an economic problem.. the better they do, the more they get rewarded
  * have some of them do it on their own.
  * have some of them receive advice from someone who is said to be an expert of economics.
</code></pre>
The results?  Guess what!  Different parts of your brain are active when you do something yourself, and when you receive advice.  Oh, and also, people tend to follow advice from experts.  Here's the amazing scientific breakthrough the research suggests: maybe we can one day make brain-scanners that tell you when you're receiving expert advice or making the decision yourself.  Wow!  I'd pay $0 for such a thing, because I don't need one:  I know when I'm choosing to take a short-cut by following expert advice, and when I'm deciding myself.<p>Following expert advise isn't a bad thing.  Think for yourselves what it means to follow expert advice -- to me it's what allows the human race to advance at such a rapid pace.  You ask someone with experience, so that you don't have to experience/learn it all yourself.  It's the same concept as paying a business to do something that would be inefficient for your own business to do, or figure out how to do.  If someone suggests using a company that in the past has had good results, and you use them, and they fail... would you say that your brain was <i>shut off</i> during the decision to use them?  No... they just let you down.  Plain and simple.  But what if someone took brain scans while you made the decision process??  Well, in that case, you could write an article about it in Wired, it seems.<p>This is sensationalized science... and in this case is especially ironic, since people seem to be taking the article headline at face value.",1238301876

I didn't solve the problem well, and I wouldn't call the implementation genius by any stretch of the imagination, but I made something useful and quite a few people use it every day -- probably more than use Rails, but I must admit I'm guessing.<p>For all the value I've produced, I'm still embarrassed by the software, and all the more so when I see other developers emulating my design and approaches that I've since learned to be sub-optimal. The work wasn't genius, but yes, it simplified something important.<p>The lesson I take away is this: value doesn't require genius, and it's foolish to conflate the two.

I've found the vast majority of what I was taught followed a progression from the basics, up towards more advanced stuff, and included the ""revelations"" in between.  There wasn't much stuff pulled out of thin air.<p>If something did seem to be pulled out of thin air, I asked critical questions, did my own research, or just made a mental note that it's note quite as much a fact as it's made out to be.  I can't think of any examples off-hand, but probably it was with stuff in sociology, where (I feel) there are so many variables it's nearly impossible to attribute an outcome to a specific type of behavior.<p>I think it's up to each person to think critically, and I think each person has the power to control whether or not they ""switch off"" their brain.

In this case it is interesting to note they already have a product, all they are doing is pre-selling a pro version. But when you try to apply this strategy to a new product being created, your focus often gets diluted. And if you are asking what customers want, you risk to get overwhelmed by their requests. So, it is better to sell after you have a actual (no matter how minimal) product. Frankly, I don't see a point in pre-selling, do you?",1238300129

The screen can sustain pen's pressure, even when I point elements on the top.<p>However when I use keyboard I tend to combine pointing stick and track pad to move the mouse. It works very natural both ways and I really enjoy interacting with a computer in this manner.<p>I prefer not to write anything unless my handwriting is recognized. I like OneNote but I use it mostly for drawing schemes, diagrams, etc. while keeping audio recording on. It's not ideal but still has some valid use cases.

My other laptop is a pretty old 15"" Dell which after 4 years can stay alive for about an hour and a half only. The power adapter was a huge brick, too.

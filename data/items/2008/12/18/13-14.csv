I mean being able to support foo 2.1 and 2.1.3 simultaneously.<p>Like every Linux distro shipped GCC296 and GCC29x for years?<p>It seems the Ruby community (and the Python community to a lesser extent) have a Not Invented Here syndrome.<p>2. Even if what RubyGems does is supported by dpkg et al., this does nothing to help the language or programs written in the language support this<p>Yes it does. Dpkg and RPM provide a standard mechanism to query if software is installed (foo), including optionally what verion is installed (foo >= 2.1).<p>3. I think the greater bigotry exists in assuming that Ruby is somehow special, and deserves to write unsigned binaries all over systems although all other software does not. Python, Java, and other languages all make the effort to integrate into their environments rather than forcing a whole new mechanism of querying, fetching, downloading, verifying, and signature checking upon users.",1229607691

402099,comment,401744,401744,0,0,frig,,,"Objective-C, the language: it's a nice, thin object-oriented layer on top of vanilla C.<p>It's super-easy to use to make object-oriented wrappers around vanilla-C libraries, compared to C++, and b/c Objective-C is conceptually simpler than C++ there's fewer ways to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>There's not much point using it for new development unless your project is very self-contained or you're targeting Mac OS X or the iphone; moreover, Apple's pushed out Objective-C 2.0 recently, and are in the driver's seat for the language's future.<p>Personally, I prefer Java for the kinds of products Objective-C is supposed to be used for (desktop/mobile software). The tradeoffs:<p>- objective-c is lighter-weight and very simple to code in; Java is a lot clunkier and tedious to write; winner: obj-c<p>- java has a huge set of support infrastructure and tooling; obj-c has xcode (which is ok, but not great); winner: java<p>- java has generics that're mostly type-safe; obj-c doesn't really have any equivalent. I like type-safety when I can get it, so winner is java.<p>If you're learning objective-c to do Cocoa or UIKit development, you will spend much more time learning your way around Cocoa and/or UIKit than learning Objective-C; objective-c is like a week at the absolute longest, but Cocoa takes months to learn.<p>The first commandment of Cocoa: always respect convention; there's lots of semi-documented conventions (in terms of naming methods and arguments and ivars and so forth), and you should follow any conventions you see unless you understand what you give up by not following that particular convention.<p>There are two golden rules for Cocoa:<p>rule 1: if you're coding up something that seems like something any realistic application would have to include, you should take another look @ the docs b/c apple probably gave it to you already.<p>rule 2: a lot of functionality you'd expect to be in utility classes is buried in base classes (like NSObject, NSArray, NSDate, etc.).",1229607236

402095,comment,401988,401990,0,0,lbrandy,,,"That was a good read. He says: ""We want to charge the maximum amount that our customers are willing to pay."" At the risk of being pedantic, the more precisely correct answer is to charge each customer how much that customer is willing to pay. All other things being equal, that would be optimal pricing. All other things, of course, aren't equal.<p>That is why versioning exists. It lets you better approximate getting each person to pay how much they'd be willing to pay without all the hassle. He has that much right.<p>The part he neglects to mention is why three versions is a magic number. He hints at the reason but it should be stated more often. People do not like complexity so having -too- many choices becomes overwhelming. Three lies in a sweet spot where people tend not to be overwhelmed (small, medium, large).<p>There is a more important reason, though, and that is the aversion to extremes. People are averse to choosing any extreme without good cause. Three is the minimum number to take advantage of this. If you had just two versions, the best way to force people to upgrade to the better and more expensive version is by simply introducing a new super-expensive third option. This causes angst in people who might otherwise buy the cheapest.<p>Hence why everything comes in small/medium/large, etc. This is also why the ""default"" position is always the middle, and you have to ask for the others specifically. Use words for the lowest like ""basic"" or ""starter"" etc. In general, versioning in threes is done to force ""most"" people into the middle option and let you profit more on your ""power users"" in the high-end (for example, I am a known ""power-user"" at Wendy's).",1229606917

402093,comment,401837,402083,0,0,adamc,,,"But having now played with it a little... I have mixed reactions. I really like the Firebug integration, but it makes it hard to run the tests outside Mozilla. And I'm not sure I like the whole firebug.ok(...) approach -- seems like the calls need to be at the top level for Firebug to pick them up, and that makes it painful to do something like run through a loop making assertions. There are obviously work-arounds (build lists, assert they are equivalent), but I'm not sure I see the win.<p>But, Resig's track record is good enough to make this a project worth monitoring...",1229606710

402082,comment,399863,400003,0,0,dsimard,,,"Retyred is on to something here.  Outside of web startups I think the trend may have actually gone the opposite way over the past 20 years or so.  Companies are getting bigger, not smaller.  Here are a few:<p>Retail: just went through a mass-consolidation.  The more dynamic firms, the ""places to be"" if you wanted to do something interesting in retail, were the ones doing the consolidating.  Think Wal-Mart, Home-Depot, Walgreens, Best-Buy etc... While it may not be interesting to the crowd here, innovation in things like supply-chain has been stunning.<p>Consumer Goods:  P&G has been unstoppable, and that's where most people in that business want to go because that's where the interesting things were happening.<p>Consumer Electronics: Dell, Apple, Sony etc... have crushed everyone.<p>Banking:  Ditto.  Where did all the ambitious young financial engineers want to go?  Easy: Goldman-Sachs.  Not that innovation here was a <i>good</i> thing... but that's another story.<p>Agriculture:  ADM, Monsanto and the agri-business giants have almost completely taken over.  Small farms are near-extinct.<p>This list could go on for a while, but I'll stop.  I think you see a similar winner-take-all pattern playing out in most industries.  It'd be interesting to see the demographics of all this: the percentages of people employed by institutions of different sizes.<p>Perhaps pg is right that it's <i>starting</i> to happen though.  Maybe the web world is at the vanguard of what will be a broad counter-trend.  I suspect that won't be as strong a force as he thinks though - the advantages of being big are still too great in too many fields.<p>Then again, maybe the mass-consolidation was artificial.  Maybe all the M&As owe as much to artificially cheap money as to natural advantages of scale.  I guess we'll see.",1229605432

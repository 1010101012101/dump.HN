If you are writing Windows Forms in C# using Visual Studio you could easily write 1,000 lines of code in an hour (because the IDE makes them for you).  Similarly, if you are merely typing up what should be done by an ORM product, then you can easily write 1,000 lines of code in a day.  I've had 3-4kloc days doing the combination of these two.  It's possible because the coding is easy, and you have tools to help you do it.  <p>Also, are we counting things like macros in this estimation?  I mean, a single line macro could yield hundreds of lines of code once through the compiler.",1185444633

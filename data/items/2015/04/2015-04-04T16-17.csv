9321313,comment,9320246,9320246,0,0,Frondo,,,"Whether Bitcoin was designed as a scam, I&#x27;m not too interested.  Whether Bitcoin today operates as a scam, I&#x27;m not too interested.  The fraudulent nature and qualities often discussed don&#x27;t interested me too much.  There is a deeper issue I&#x27;ve raised, that I&#x27;ve never seen satisfactorily addressed, with Bitcoin:<p>It has economic assumptions baked into it (deflationary, fixed size of money pool, etc).  These assumptions, like all economic assumptions built into a currency, will guide and govern people&#x27;s behavior and use of it.  That means that bitcoin is a human-invented system that, if it came into any widespread adoption, would play a role in suggesting or controlling people&#x27;s behavior, just like any currency.<p>The difference is, the people whose behavior would be controlled have no say in changing those economic assumptions.  The people who could potentially live in a bitcoin-infused world have no voice in how it operates.  Bitcoin, in effect, takes a degree of agency from the people, and this is especially problematic if it became widespread enough that you&#x27;d be compelled to use it.<p>Why does that matter?  Because people have a right to democratic institutions.  People have a right to vote on or have a say in matters that govern their lives.  Bitcoin, as it exists now, takes that away from people.<p>And, to bring up a couple of things people have said to be me here before, the fact that Bitcoin can be changed (i.e. by writing new code and persuading 100% of the community to adopt it) does not make it democratic.  Setting the barrier to democratic participation at &quot;learn to code, or pay someone to code, and then change everyone over all at once to your new software&quot; means that that isn&#x27;t really a democratic system at all.<p>And to bring up the point that currency shouldn&#x27;t be democratically decided, well, no.  People have a right to govern their affairs and live in a society responsive to their needs.  Moving in the direction of taking some of that agency away is moving in the wrong direction.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to digital currency in general, but I am opposed to one that operates in a way that I have no democratic recourse if I don&#x27;t like how it runs.",1428166138

9321308,comment,9321090,9321090,0,0,AngrySkillzz,,,"Yes. In the same way that Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman have described our media as being or shaping the contents of the messages we send, our technologies and processes shape the way we live, act, and view the world around us.<p>Take military drones, for instance. People are not concerned about drones because they can be used to kill each other; we have been killing each other for millennia. What makes drones concerning is the relative ease and safety with which they allow us to kill each other. We no longer have to risk the lives of our sons and daughters to wage war in far-off lands; we can do the same from the comfort and safety of a bunker.<p>What does this mean? We are risking less when we wage war. Waging war is easier. This makes us much more likely to be warlike. What we previously may not have seen as a worthy cause for risking the lives of our troops may yet be seen as a worthy cause for risking our money, in the form of UAVs, robotics, ammunition, etc. On the side of the attacker, war becomes more about spending money than risking lives. That is a big difference.<p>Moreover, these changes have consequences for the people war is waged against as well as innocent bystanders. An occupying soldier is less likely to target and execute a civilian than a soldier piloting a drone from far away. Innocents are much easier to mistake for insurgents on a computer screen.<p>The psychic distance between two people is far larger when they are separated by digital rather than physical space, meaning less empathy is involved. A reduction in empathy makes it easier to risk the lives of the people you intend to ignore or protect. This is the same reason people are so mean to each other on the Internet.",1428165998

I do support the idea of digital currencies (possibly even decentralized), but I don&#x27;t think Bitcoin is the appropriate flag bearer.  I understand the term &quot;scam&quot; may seem rude or offensive, but it is what I mean.  For example: I don&#x27;t mean &quot;I think Bitcoin is a bad investment.&quot;  I think it is something else entirely.<p>I understand this seems to be a minority opinion on hacker news.  I know I don&#x27;t have the exact parameters of the scam.  But insisting on such degenerates into some weird imitation of constructivist logic that seems to claim: if you can&#x27;t point out exactly when you are going to be ripped off then you can&#x27;t prove you are going to be ripped off, and therefore you don&#x27;t know you are being ripped off.<p>Or: no, I don&#x27;t know how to make money shorting Bitcoin.  But I also don&#x27;t know how to make money shorting 419 scams.  That doesn&#x27;t mean these things have positive value.  Assuming information always has tradable value (i.e. you can go long or go short) is attempting to apply an idea that may or may not be true for investments to a completely different category (scams).<p>What I think confuses people is we are in the time interval where Bitcoin is a successful scam.  So it superficially appears different than any past failed scam  you compare it to.  But Bitcoin is almost entirely about paying earlier investors purely with proceeds from later investors.  A lot of abstract markets and currencies do appear to be similar to this, but tend to have other mitigating features that I just don&#x27;t see in Bitcoin.  (The mitigating factor for traditional currencies is the large state institutions that would lose reputation in a hyperinflation scenario, hasn&#x27;t always stopped hyperinflation- but it is at least a weak counter-force; for stocks it is the fiction of company control/ownership/dividends/voting-rights; gold the liquidity of the resale market and demand for jewelry; I am not saying these are good institutions, just that you certainly don&#x27;t want to be even worse.)<p>I would say to the pro-Bitcoin crowd: if you don&#x27;t think Bitcoin is a scam, is there any description of a system that you would consider a scam (with our without the Bitcoin name attached)?  I say this in seriousness as I really suspect there is some sort of &quot;by definition informed investors can&#x27;t be scammed, they can only make good or bad investments&quot; element to some of the debates.",1428163607

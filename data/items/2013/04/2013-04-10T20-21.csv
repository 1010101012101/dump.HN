Is this really the level-headed advice he should hear:<p>""If you listen to your parents and waste four or five years at college you will be financially worse off and regret it. Your parents care about you and think they are giving you good advice but they are not.""<p>To be honest, that's shit. It's ignorant, and no better than calling everyone without degrees a bum.<p>What should be said is pretty much what his parents are hinting at. Go to college for security, unless you have something really special lined up. Trust me, it is very very hard to get a good job without a degree (and still hard to get a good job with one). You can still have plenty of time to work on side projects while in school. You can always go to school later, but it never gets any easier.<p>Edit: man, there is just so much to be said after re-reading all this. And each time I disagree with you more. The fact you are so absolute, that fact that you are so wrong...<p>Look 23 is not too late for anything. The world moves fast now, but evolution in a person occurs much longer than ever before.

You are the only one calling people idiots here I'm afraid.<p>The fact that some things stood the test of time has no predictive value. It's just confirmation bias. There are plenty of things that existed for far more than 50 years that did not stand the test of time. The horse cart, the abacus, and the spear for example. I believe that as IDEs and other programming tools become more sophisticated, it starts to make more and more sense for them to work directly on abstract syntax trees rather than plain text strings. But this is another discussion.<p>I'm well aware that the W3C has not have original started the standards (including the original HTML), but it's how they evolve, accumulate cruft, and it's how we get stuck with them. Standardization can only ever accumulate complexity on the web. Things cannot easily, or at all, be removed. With an organic model, as soon as things fall out of use they disappear from consideration.<p>Perhaps you can implement HTTP and HTML 1.0 in a few days if you are a hero programmer. I'm not sure what your point is. We are living in 2013 not 1989.<p>Yes, the client can't do as much high level optimization, and that's a good thing. That kind of optimization belongs be at the library level, not at the client level (and certainly not duplicated several times for every different browser vendor each with a slightly different and inconsistent implementation).<p>I agree that markup will be transmitted in 100 years, and I'm pretty sure so does Alan Kay. He, like I do, simply believes that the building blocks should be inverted. The thing that interprets the markup doesn't belong hard coded in the client. The client should simply be universal (i.e. Turing complete) and the thing that interprets and renders the markup should be built on top of that.<p>I agree that in 100 years we can still separate text into paragraphs and make things bold, but there are plenty of things that let you do that which are not HTML, and neither is the main point of HTML separating text into paragraphs and making things bold (certainly not in 2013).

In NYC we've seen a rise of intercity buses competing at cut-rate prices, and one such bus company recently and spectacularly failed every single safety inspection performed on their vehicles. They also have an accident rate several times that of their less price-sensitive consumers (Greyhound, Amtrak, etc).<p>Free markets often have substantial downsides, it's dishonest to pretend that regulation is strictly driven by parasitic behavior. There are also substantial upsides to commoditization - i.e., gains in efficiency when every consumer does not have to engage in complex analysis of the product on every sale. There is a loss of market confidence when you have to go through a mound of paperwork just to determine which intercity bus line is safe to ride.<p>When a market is over-regulated, such regulation often have legitimate and still-relevant roots.

Feel free to email me directly, shri@flightcar.com, and let me know how we can fix this. I'll outline below on some things we've already implemented and others that we are working on fixing and will implement soon and what we've done to make sure no one has an experience like your's again.<p>Car pictures: We started taking pictures of all cars at every handoff. Unfortunately, your car was dropped off a few days before we started this practice,  but it's now standard protocol.<p>Driving record checks: We've had these in place all along. We obtain a driving record from each renter's local dmv to make sure that their driving history doesn't indicate that they're at risk of damaging an owner's vehicle.<p>Concerning tolls: We're working on a system to manage and capture tolls so that vehicle owners no longer face this problem.<p>Phone call and wait time: I honestly don't know what happened when you had no response on our phone line. I've heard from other customers that they have had difficulty reaching an operator as well, so we are looking into changing our phone system provider asap. Your experience was definitely the exception. I'm so sorry about that.<p>Your stuff being placed in the car: The garbage bag situation is utterly unacceptable. This is not the standard practice by any means and we've already spoken to the employee who handled your items and made it clear that what happened will never happen again.<p>What we are doing now: Rujul, my cofounder, has printed your blog post and handed it to each member of our staff and made sure that all of our staff realizes that what had happened was unacceptable and understands what we need to do to fix it.<p>Once again, I apologize for your terrible experience and do let me know how we can fix it.<p>Sincerely,

Because it does not physically exist and is rather made-up, it is scarcer than gold or silver, hence more conceptually sound and more highly prized.

Each fusion mini-explosion will have a total energy that is the sum of the input (ignition) energy and the fusion itself, not just that of the fusion.<p>Yes, technically true, but consider this hypothetical scenario:<p>1. A power source, let's say 1000 watts, can be used for any purpose, or can be used to heat a fusion plasma.<p>2. A fusion reactor requires 1000 watts to sustain fusion but delivers 250 watts of fusion power.<p>3. The total power in the system is now 1,250 watts.<p>4. But that total power is not available for external uses. 1000 watts of it must perpetually be applied only to the task of heating the plasma.<p>5. That leaves 250 watts for other uses.<p>That means the fusion reaction uses more power than it produces, only 250 watts is available for other purposes, and there is no remedy except to not use the fusion reactor.<p>That's why break-even is an essential precondition for this project's viability.",1365626168

Some specific servers like SANs go direct 10GE, particularly if you're going to have 1-2 SAN interfaces and a bunch of clients (so you can use the 10GE uplink ports for it).<p>Enough things are CPU/memory/etc. bound that the ""cheap"" building block of a 1-2CPU server with 4GE, RAM, and some local disk is still more appropriate than buying a Xeon E7 with 10GE HBAs, in most cases.  There might be an exception if you have per-host vs. per-core licensing for expensive stuff, or other artificial complaints, or a specific component (database?) which doesn't horizontally scale.<p>I predict $5k 40-port 10GE switches and commodity server on-board 10GE NICs in a couple years, though.  Although at that point, you need something crazy to uplink the switches.  40GE is emerging, or you could use a non-ethernet option.  SANs are the big application for 10GE now since you can comfortably fit all the clients and servers on a standard 10GE switch and don't need to uplink most of the traffic.  Part of the issue with the higher speed ethernets is lack of a copper cabling option, particularly one which works with existing cable plants.  (less of a concern within racks).",1365626026

To most people it is worthless, but to the recipient it has worth.  Its utility and use value to the recipient is not measurable.  The utility and use value of any commodity is not measurable.  The drawing has a use value even if no one wants to buy it - it is useful to the recipient.<p>Commodity values also reflect the work put into them.  Let's say I assemble PCs.  I buy $600 worth of parts - motherboard, disk drive etc.  I spend an hour assembling the parts into a PC.  I now want to sell it for more than $600 since I want to be paid for my time, maybe $50 for the hour - it is now $650 total.  Each of the components of the PC I paid $600 for the parts of is more expensive because of the labor costs associated with assembling that component.  So the value of a commodity is also connected to its labor costs.<p>Utility can not be measured as it is subjective - like the child's painting.  Exchange value can be measured though.  I can buy an OK pair of headphones for $20, I can buy dinner for $20 as well.  So a certain pair of headphones are worth the same as 20 dollars are worth the same as a certain dinner at a certain restaurant.<p>We have had currency for thousands of years.  Currencies have always held value due to their inherit value as a commodity, not due to being an exchange medium.  Attempts have been made over the centuries to try to change this, but it has never been long lasting.  The US dollar was backed by gold until 1971.  Now paper currency has value due to the US government accepting it for taxes, stamps and so forth, but such things have been relatively short-lived through history so far.  Paper currencies like Confederate dollars, Reichmarks in 1945 and such depend on political factors for their worth( <a href=""http://www.moneymuseum.com/moneymuseum/library/texts/text.jsp?lang=en&id=72019"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneymuseum.com/moneymuseum/library/texts/text.js...</a> )

5527919,comment,5526893,5527644,11,0,coldtea,,,"><i>at what point did people start to use the word ""pragmatic"" for ""opinionated""?</i><p>I don't think people are doing that. It's just that being pragmatic also makes you opinionated by necessity.<p>Actually that would a very good definition: being pragmatic means you are ""opinionated by necessity"" (as opposed to opinionated by other concerns, e.g pureness, advancing the state of the art, etc). So being pragmatic is a subset of being opinionated, not a synonym.<p>><i>when the implementer of a language or technology makes a choice that restricts how its users can do some things, it makes an opinionated decision, that just happens to be pragmatic in the use-context he has thought of, but may not be pragmatic at all for the use-context that some technology user imagines</i><p>A language has thousands (millions) of users and every one can imagine whatever use-context. Not catering to all of them doesn't make you opinionated: merely pragmatic. Nobody has the time and the means to cater to all possible use-contexts. And we all know that adding too many things can ruin a language, over-complicate it and such. So that's another pragmatic concern.<p>><i>like a language feature that may be hard-to-impossible to implement but that when done properly (and it only has to be done once) would simplify the lives of a large group of programmers that just want to do things in a certain way.</i><p>Sounds like a very horrible feature to build into a language. Especially when you are starting out. If it's ""hard-to-impossible to implement"" then you are wasting tons of resources to something that might very well not pan out in the end.<p>To reject this is not opinionated in the bad way. It's merely being pragmatic again, ie understanding that you have to prioritize things, and not go on a wild goose chase.",1365625650

1. True, but you have to hit a combination of a test bug/feature bug to let the feature bug slip through
2. Also true. And we had to deal with those type of bugs. When the area is tricky (transaction log rotation, quorums, etc) we sometime have to the extends of proving things formally.
3. Very true. And scenario based testing will only get you this far. Receiving customer feedback is critical for that. Obviously SAS has advantage here.

Apart from stars and weapons, it has never been achieved.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_energy_gain_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_energy_gain_factor</a><p>Quote: ""The fusion energy gain factor, usually expressed with the symbol Q, is the ratio of fusion power produced in a nuclear fusion reactor to the power required to maintain the plasma in steady state. The condition of Q = 1 is referred to as breakeven.""<p>> If you achieve even smallest amount of fusion, technically you have more energy than you started with.<p>Yes, but with serious problems. One of them is that you have to continue providing more power than the reaction creates, in order to keep the reaction going. This means the overall available power is less than the input power. The reaction is using up much of the power to sustain itself, and that power can't be applied to another purpose. So even though technically there is a lot of power present, it cannot be applied to any purpose other than energizing the plasma. This means the net available power is less than the input power.<p>This is a bit hard to visualize, so let's say that we have 1000 watts available to apply to some ordinary purpose, or to sustain a fusion reaction.<p>We discover that the fusion reactor requires all 1000 watts to keep its plasma activated and fusing, but the fusion reaction only produces 250 watts. So, even though there is 1,250 watts of power in the system, 1000 watts of that is required to sustain the plasma in its fusing state and is therefore unavailable. That means only 250 watts is available for any other purpose.<p>Hence the importance of break-even. :)",1365624974

I didn't really start visiting HN for politics or shocking stories; those tend to disproportionately draw upvotes.

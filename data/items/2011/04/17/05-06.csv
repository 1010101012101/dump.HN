And I have to admit, I liked it, a lot more than I thought I would.  Here are some of my thoughts:<p>- It irks me quite lot that I need to use a Google account to log into the OS.  If they remove that restriction it'll go a long way to alleviating the Google-creepiness.<p>- In the Hexxeh release I used Flash was not enabled by default, I had to click a warning message to use Flash on every page, I assume this is fixed by now<p>- There is no user-exposed filesystem and no way to install apps (without hacking in a console).  There is no software, desktop, icons, home folders... nothing.  You totally get this feeling of using an Operating System-Free computer.<p>- The version of Chrome browser that gets installed maybe wasn't the latest but it certainly does feel fast enough to use, especially on a slow system.  Chrome browser on ChromeOS is significantly faster than IE on Windows on the same system.<p>- HackerNews displays with a serif font presumably because PG doesn't have a 'sans-serif' alternative font in the HN codebase.<p>- I have a very strong urge to minimize the browser and see the desktop.<p>- The browser does not have a full-screen mode.  If you want to watch a youtube video, there is no way to maximize the video, the tabs and URL bar are always visible.  I found this to be extremely annoying and hopefully gets added.<p>- The browser needs to have a tab split-screen mode.  I need to be able to look at 2 or more windows simultaneously, and the modal restriction gets on my nerves.<p>- To my surprise both audio and my webcam worked, although I had some boot up issues when the webcam was plugged into the USB port, but I could plug it in once it was booted up<p>There are some major usability problems here, but if they get addressed it could become quite cool.  I would totally enjoy having this built into my next television or monitor.",1303018680

2455620,comment,2455530,2455530,4,0,lionhearted,,,"> I think this [Reagan-era] ideology is bad: bad for the economy, bad for society...<p>I think Regan is popularly overrated in a lot of areas, but if you're looking to analyze the impact his policies had on the economy, you have to note two important points:<p>1. Total federal tax income <i>rose</i> after the Reagan-era tax cuts. There's plenty of potential reasons why, but you've got to give serious thought to the idea that we were at an inoptimum point in the Laffer Curve before that:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve</a><p>2. It's absolutely a fact that as people get wealthier, their spending shifts from consumption to investment. So it's pretty straightforward to see that larger fortunes <i>without falling tax yields</i> means more funds for investment.<p>Even if you don't like Reagan, you've got to give serious thought to the idea that the Reagan-era cuts played a significant part in the rapid growth of the technology sector that's come to fruition the last 20 years. That's created one of the largest increases in wealth for everyone in the United States in history.<p>But anyways, ex-libertarian here. I'd be in favor of more government spending in infrastructure and sciences. I think Reagan's domestic policy is overrated. But you've got to give some serious thought to the idea that the tax cuts led to a lot of the economic growth of the last 20 years - higher tax yields and higher private wealth leading to higher investment is really good mix for economic growth.",1303017858

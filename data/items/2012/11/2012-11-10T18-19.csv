I set up a small organization with one goal: Get kids to smoke weed.<p>Pick a handful of communities in the legal states: Wealthy, suburban districts that went blue, but narrowly. Send a couple of guys to each one with ten pounds of marijuana and ten thousand dollars in cash. Have them recruit some bored 21-year-old stoners, give them each twenty bucks for snacks and a dozen rolled joints, and have them hang out at the skate park or movie theater or wherever and just pass out free weed.<p>Those joints will inevitably wind up in the hands of teenagers and even young children. Ramp up the operation enough, and you've got a full-blown weed epidemic. Without any further prompting, parent groups will petition the state and federal government to intervene, and if not repeal the law then at least impose enough additional restrictions to keep an illegal operation cost-competitive with a legit one.<p>Of course, there are lots of ways this strategy could fail or even backfire.",1352573920

4767357,comment,4766475,4766475,7,0,jb17,,,"I think the author actually adds to the confusion about TSP by being unnecessarily vague.<p>Both P and NP are classes of decision problems. That means they only contain problems that ask for a yes/no answer. So because TSP asks for a route, it is not just a decision problem, and can't be in NP. However, as the author mentions, NP does in fact contain the TSP-DECIDE problem in the way he defines it.<p>Moreover, the problem TSP of finding a lowest cost route can be solved by a polynomial time Turing Machine that can use a TSP-DECIDE oracle (i.e. call a constant time function that solves TSP-DECIDE). It is in fact complete for that class FP^NP (""= function problems solvable in polynomial time with an oracle for NP problems""), which means it is one of the hardest problems there. The class FP^NP contains all of FNP (NP for functional problems) and is believed to contain more problems -- so there is a good chance that TSP is not in FNP.",1352573333

Also, it's important to keep in mind that Google also sells licensed content like magazines and movies and stuff through the play store in the USA, which it can't really do in India (not yet anyway).

They generally don't just try and drive it through a manned checkpoint. Helicopters have been known to be involved [3][4][5]. It is not uncommon for BC marijuana to be smuggled in to Washington and exchanged for cocaine that came to Washington from California, and came to California from Mexico.

It just has to cost enough to make the trouble of buying marijuana on the black market seem worthwhile for the consumer and the profit and risk worthwhile to the dealers.  We can call this the ""black market viability price point"".<p>It's quite likely that this black market viability price point can be significantly below current illegal marijuana prices.  But it's not yet clear how much above the cost of production legal marijuana can be taxed before it approaches the black market viability price point.<p>Alcohol legalization and taxation might be seen as a positive role model for how marijuana legalization and taxation could be carried out.

Will there be some people still getting it 'illegally'? Sure, as you pointed out there is a black market for cigarettes, but it pales in profit comparison to markets that are entirely illegal, and cartels aren't going to be attracted to nickel and dime markets when they have so many other ways to make money.<p>American organized crime may be involved in black market cigarettes, but that could also be viewed as a sign of them searching for new revenue streams as their old(er) ones get shut down or become less reliable. Organized crime also used to be involved in alcohol, not so much anymore yet it is still heavily taxed in most peoples eyes.<p>Further, I assume that legal providers would need some sort of approval/licensing from the state. Illegal providers would not pursue that. So while they would save money dodging the licensing/tax issues they likely could not cost compete with legal producers as they are taking a greater risk they would want to be compensated for (i.e. arrest). The illegal producers would then be doing a risky activity (they wouldn't be shielded by the legality if there are rules around production/supply that they aren't following) and incurring costs that legal producers would not incur. Whether those costs offset the licensing/tax issues is unclear, but I suspect they would.<p>I don't think your claim is preposterous (that taxes need to be kept in check), but I also am not convinced that taxes will be so high as to drive this kind of market.

Apple has been very aggressively protecting their copyright on service manuals pretty much since the dawn of the internet. Here's an example of them going after Something Awful [2]. Many of the sites they've gone after have ceased to exist.<p>Since then, with the help of tens of thousands of incredible repair technicians around the world, we have built the largest free repair manual [3]. Because we write them ourselves, the manufacturers can't shut us down. The community has written over 6,000 manuals, and you can download and reproduce any of them to your heart's content. We even post all of our manuals on bittorrent [4] and the internet archive so they are guaranteed to be free forever.<p>Here's our Toshiba laptop service manual: <a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/Device/Toshiba_Laptop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/Device/Toshiba_Laptop</a><p>We've made progress on half a dozen laptops so far, with more on the way.

Many manufacturers haven't gotten around to issuing these C&D letters, but it's perfectly within their right. Any site hosting manufacturer service manuals without permission is at risk of a shutdown like this at any time.<p>That's why what we do at iFixit is so important. The world needs to know how to fix these products. Repair is critical for the environment [5]. Repair helps bridge the digital divide by keeping the secondhand electronics market alive.  [6] And electronics repair represents hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States alone.<p>We cannot rely on the good will of manufacturers. Yes, many of them have looked the other way and ignored sites like timix's, but that is unlikely to continue. We have three options:<p>* Create a free and open alternative to the manufacturer's service manuals (that's what we're doing at iFixit).<p>* Pressure the manufacturers to waive copyright to their manuals so that we can reproduce them. Dell, HP, and Lenovo are the best targets for this because they already provide manuals online. (I am involved in discussions with some OEMs to make this happen. The more public support we have, the more success we'll have.)<p>* Legislate. The auto manufacturers refused to provide independent shops with the information they needed, so they banded together and just passed Right to Repair legislation in Massachusetts last week.<p>It's easy to say, ""shame on Toshiba"" and move on with your life. But this is not unique to Toshiba. No cell phone manufacturer makes their service manuals available. In fact, outside of the heavy equipment industry (where customers demand it) and the automotive industry (where legislation requires it), it's the rare manufacturer that does not use copyright to prevent publication of their service manuals.<p>I wrote the Self Repair Manifesto:<a href=""http://ifixit.com/Manifesto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifixit.com/Manifesto</a><p>It's time to make the voice of the consumer known. It's time for us to stand up for ourselves. We have the right to repair our things, and to the information required to do it.<p>We are making some progress. The forthcoming green cell phone standard, UL 110, gives manufacturers environmental points for providing open source service manuals. That gain is tenuous and could be reversed at any time, but it's a foothold.<p>I've dedicated my life to making this information available, and we can't do it alone. We need to band together as a community and take a stand.<p>We would love help. Join us over at iFixit! Or, if you want to get involved with advocacy work, email me at kyle at ifixit and I'll happily point you in the right direction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Apple_Legal_Issues_Cease_Desist_Over_Service_Manual_Posting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Apple_Legal_Issues_Ce...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/Guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/Guide</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/blog/2010/12/20/what-if-you-had-a-dvd-with-every-ifixit-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/blog/2010/12/20/what-if-you-had-a-dvd-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://ifixit.com/Info/Environment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifixit.com/Info/Environment</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://ifixit.org/2562/computer-repair-is-the-new-lemonade-stand/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifixit.org/2562/computer-repair-is-the-new-lemonade-s...</a>",1352571821

Unfortunately, the physics involved and available so far have proven fairly intractable.  (I've tried variations of most of what's been posted here.  And I can't use music as a block -- too distracting.)<p>If someone really takes on this problem, my anecdotal experience is one of having encountered a significant number of people who would buy in.  People looking for an Apple-like experience:  High quality manufacturing and performance combined with a simple choice or set of choices.  This includes ergonomics; for example, in addition to not providing complete attenuation, tightly sealing over-ear muffs can become extremely uncomfortable, tiring, and physically distracting during extended wear.",1352570617

4767206,comment,4766746,4767164,6,0,MattRogish,,,"Indeed. I've been a developer for about 13 years. The last 6 and change has been doing Rails and JS app development (I started out doing VC++ apps for Windows). I haven't thought about MS stack at all since about 2002. And I don't recall any presentations at RailsConf this year about .NET. No one in my circles even gives .NET a second thought.<p>ASP MVC may be pretty rad, but I personally hate C# (Ruby is an amazingly better language) and I don't feel like buying into the Microsoft ecosystem. It's not one that shares my values and culture, and from the outside it seems to be losing momentum and relevance. I'm not aware of many developers who would decide to adopt Rails over .NET due to these ""lies"" - the choice is first cultural, then technical.<p>I'm not suggesting that .NET shops are worse places to work (although that has been my personal experience) but there's something about the MS ecosystem that puts .NET shops at risk of turning into overly-stuffy/corporate, aesthetically-unpleasing shops. There are exceptions of course (FogCreek/StackOverflow) but they don't appear to be the norm.",1352570422

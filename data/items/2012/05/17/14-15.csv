3987255,comment,3986844,3986844,5,0,jrs235,,,"I understand everyone's sentiment about Steve's blogs on earning passive income. If you look around his site he does have some interesting blog posts on things like Polyphasic Sleep.<p>HN readers for the most part are probably not in need of his motivational/inspirational ""speeches"" and articles. And most understand the desirability of passive income but understand its challenges, obstacles, and reality.<p>Someone similar who shares Mr. Pavlina's strong beliefs and desires for everyone to achieve their life's goals and live every day to its fullest is Ramit Sethi (<a href=""http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/</a>) with his own book and numerous other ""programs"" like Earn 1K. Ramit recognizes and addresses the reality of passive income and recommends not going after it at first.<p>Both Ramit and Steve are excellent reminders and motivators to keep working towards your goals similar to 21times.org's daily email newsletters for startups.<p>UPDATE: I like what someone else said in another comment here. Paraphrasing it: Don't think of it as passive income, think of it as delayed income.<p>UPDATE: Let's clarify what we all really mean by ""passive"". It's not really passive as in ""you don't have to do anything"". What we mean is that we are no longer trading straight time for income. Our income potential is no longer limited to the number of hours we are awake trading our time for money.<p>UPDATE: The delayed income relies upon a long tail return. Often the amount of energy consumed to setup the long term tail is very similar to the amount of time and energy early (and bootstrapping) startups invest in hopes of recouping their time and money investment at a later date (and in hopes of that return being many times greater than what a hourly rated ""job"" would pay).",1337266724

From the article:<p><i>> I have no qualms with walking away from projects, as I expect that if the idea is valuable, someone else will be happy to step up and take my place;</i><p>Up to here I agree. However, the article continues with:<p><i>> it's more likely that several people will step up and the strongest will survive - which is best for everyone.</i><p>To my experience, this is the #1 reason why promising projects die (by slowly converting to crap): The maintainer goes away, quietly, leaving everyone in confusion. I always thought this would happen only by accident (previous maintainer overestimates his/her free time). But I'd never have thought anybody would do this on purpose.<p>It is really minimal effort to drop a quick note about dropping the project and naming a successor.",1337266700

This is usually the minority of people<p>- Having a job at a company<p>So, yes, companies create jobs, next<p>Big companies create more jobs (per 'unit'). Smaller companies create less jobs (per 'unit') but combined they make more jobs in total.<p>Companies create an opening because of: increased production (or more customers, in case of services), new line of business. This is ignoring regular turnaround where someone quits to go somewhere else and someone is hired to replace.<p>Hence, new jobs comes from:\n- New products / services<p>- More people consuming existing products<p>(we could add loss of efficiency as well)<p>Now, bigger companies have a much easier time hiring new people. HR is set and knows the drill, they usually can accomodate new people with their existing profits (maybe not a lot, still)<p>Smaller companies have a <i>much harder time</i> hiring another people. Suppose you are a one man company, and you want to hire someone. You have to be HR (this cuts into your time). You may be not sure if adding this person is going to increase the profits enough to cover for the extra costs, etc<p>So when you cut taxes to all companies, sure, you're helping the big guys, but also the small guys.<p>The rich have an easier time dodging regulation or sending their profits to Ireland and back, but <i>not the small guy</i><p>""And taxing the rich to make investments that grow the middle class"" (from the article)<p>Yadda yadda yadda.

Most high schools in the region have some sort of magnet program that allow for students to attend without living in the school's defined area. Both my sister and I went to different schools than where we were 'supposed' to go. So it's not a hard line, but these magnet programs only accept so many students. So for the most part it is true.

Year-over-year variation is high, indicating that there's likely a lot of noise in the measure.  That said, year-to-year scores <i>do</i> correlate.  This means that the measure is at least a little bit reliable in the sense that if you measure the same thing twice you'll get an answer that's close to the original.<p>All he's shown is that these are ""noisy"".  There's no reason not to use a noisy metric, you just need to know that's what you've got, and make responsible decisions.<p>For example, don't fire teachers who rank poorly, but do review their performance.  In that case, we'd find that the ""Worst Teacher"" is underperforming on this metric because it wasn't designed to test great students, and we can move on.  Another example of the same phenomena in education is looking for teachers who help students cheat exams.  When there are suspicious correlations found, administrators investigate.<p>One last thing: What he doesn't investigate -- and this is much more important -- is the (lack of a) correlation between value added ratings and other metrics (say, peer evaluations).",1337264885

The answer he comes up with is that the Western Empire had much greater concentration of wealth in the hands of the senatorial class.  This meant that it was hard to collect taxes to pay for things like an army, and at the time of the invasions of the Goths and Franks, the Eastern Empire was collecting three times in taxes what the Western Empire was collecting, and thus spending more on their army than the Western Empire was collecting in taxes.<p>Without sufficient tax revenues he military machine could not sustain itself, and when three senatorial households had a budgets that combined equalled the entire tax revenue of the Western Empire these super-wealthy were just too politically powerful to tax.

I was getting in a lot of trouble becuase I was bored out of my mind at school, yet I could pass the tests multiple years ahead of me. My parents fought pretty hard but ultimately the school let me take a bunch of tests to prove I could make it by skipping a grade or two. I passed them and was given the option of skipping 8th grade and going straight to high school from 7th.<p>I didn't take that option. I knew a lot of the kids in my neighborhood and they were all 1-2 years older. They would all know that I had skipped ahead and many were bullies. That was definitely a fear of mine if I stayed in the same school district.<p>Thus my parents looked at private schools. All the private schools were willing to let me skip to high school as well. Unfortunately they were expensive (my parents didn't make an issue of this, but I was aware of it). I also didn't really want to leave my friends and a lot of the kids at the private school seemed more stuck up.<p>So I ended up staying with my normal grade and the public school jumped me ahead with a lot independet study stuff as much as possible. It helped a bit. What helped a lot more was the principal telling the teachers that I was allowed to read during their classes so long as I wasn't getting in trouble. I basically spent middle school as one giant independent study reading books from the town library.<p>Thankfully when I got to high school, the classes got massively better. I ended up basically finding 3 teachers that really pushed me to go above and beyond the regular curriculum. I took 3 history classes from one of the best teachers I've ever had. I had 2 years of science from a guy with a chemical engineering phD and who powered through MIT in 3 years. And I had a drafting/wood shop/stage craft teacher who let me build and draw stuff as much as I wanted. Those three guys helped me to learn an enormous amount in high school and have a great time.<p>Once I got to college, I was really glad I didn't skip ahead.<p>I'm very thankful that my parents pushed the school to let me move ahead when I made it clear I wanted that. I'm also glad they didn't force me to do it after they fought so hard to get the school to let me. They were very supportive, but not over bearing.<p>If your kid wants to move ahead, help him. If he doesn't, don't force him. One of my dad's coworkers forced his daughter through school ahead of schedule like you want to. She graduated high school at an early age, went to Princeton, and was out by age 18. She went to med school and was a doctor by 22.<p>She can't get any patients. Nobody actually wants a doctor who is 22. She is depressed, doing research (that she doesn't want to do) and is pissed off about missing out on high school, college, etc. For what?<p>The end result was his coworker getting divorced and barely ever seeing his daughter.<p>On the other hand, I worked with a guy who graduated high school early, graduated college by the time he was 20, and he's one of the smartest, nicest, most succesful people I know.<p>My personal experience is that the BS is late elementary and middle school. If your parents teach you simple math and reading at home you can jump ahead 2-3 years. By high school the availability of AP classes, independent study, and better electives (music, stagecraft, architecture, art, etc) make it far more enjoyable. I don't think shortening high school makes as much sense as shortening middle school.<p>I also think you have to listen to what your kid wants to do, not go based on what you want them to do.",1337264390

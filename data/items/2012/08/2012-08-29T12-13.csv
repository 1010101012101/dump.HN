4448238,comment,4445180,4445180,1,0,shyn3,,,"There is a company out here that called me several days ago in regards to their service. I will summarize their business model.<p>They charge by the ticket and complexity of the issue. I.e. If they open a ticket for application support it starts at $10.00 per ticket. If the ticket takes over 2-hours to complete it increases to $20.00. If it goes over 6-hours then it increases to $25.00. At 12-hours it is $40.00. If the ticket isn't resolved in 12-hours they bite the bullet and have to figure it out.<p>For backup/maintenance/monitoring they create and implement a system that automates all this. They spend 10 hours a week updating/monitoring on their low-level package which costs $50.00. If you want to upgrade to premium support meaning they work on yours and only yours for those 10-hours then they charge 100% of the fee.<p>They also allow you to buy hours in bulk and then transfer the hours over billing cycles. So you can buy 100 hours of application support. This would let you set it at any level free of charge.<p>Their pricing is a little hard to understand so I don't recommend it but then again on a pay-per-use basis I guess it is the only way.<p>They also charge by the level of the ticket. They have Low, Medium, High, and Urgent. If you decide your ticket is low priority you pay the rates I discussed above. If you escalate each level increases your support ticket costs by 25%. The Urgent level is an increase of 50%.<p>So for application support general ticket, $10.00. Update it to Urgent would cost $23.50. ((($10.00 * 1.25) * 1.25) * 1.5)",1346245030

4448230,comment,4444793,4448059,9,0,richhickey,,,"The model of consistency envisioned by Datomic is one in which consistency normally available only within a transaction is available <i>outside of any transactions</i>, and without any central authority. Consistent views can be reconstituted the next hour, day or week. Consistent points in time can be efficiently communicated to other processes. Nothing about MVCC gives you any of that. MVCC is an implementation detail that reduces coordination overhead in transactional systems. I used MVCC in the implementation of Clojure's STM. While you might imagine it being simple to flip a bit on an MVCC system and get point-in-time support, it is a) not efficient to do so, and b) still a coordinated transactional system.<p>The differences I am pointing out, and the notion of place I discuss, are not about the implementation details in the small (e.g. whether or not a db is MVCC or updates its btree nodes in place) but the model in the large. If you 'update' someone's email is the old email gone? Must you be inside a transaction to see something consistent? Is the system oriented around preserving information (the facts of events that have happened), or is the system oriented around maintaining a single logical value of a model?<p>The fact is with PostgreSQL et al, if you 'update' someone's email the old one is gone, and you can only get consistency within a transaction. It is a system oriented around maintaining a single logical value of a model. And there's nothing wrong with that - it's a great system with a lot of utility. But it isn't otherwise just because you say it <i>could be</i>.<p>Also, you seem to be reacting as if I (or someone) has claimed that Datomic is revolutionary. I have never made such claims. Nothing is truly novel, everything has been tried before, and we all stand on the shoulders of giants.<p>I'm sorry my talk didn't convey to you my principal points, and am happy to clarify.",1346244919

4448189,comment,4444793,4448092,0,0,saurik,,,"The reason I claim this would be simple is that PostgreSQL is <i>almost</i> already doing this. The way the data is stored on disk, every row has two transactions identifiers, xmin and xmax, which represent the transaction when that row was inserted the the transaction that row was deleted; rows, meanwhile, are never updated in place, so the old data stays around until it is deleted by a vacuum.<p>To demonstrate more tangibly how this works, I just connected to my database server (running PostgreSQL 9.1), created a table and added a row. I did so inside of a transaction, and printed the transaction identifier. I then queried the data in the table from a new transaction, showing that the xmin is set to the identifier of the transaction that added the row.<p>Connection 1:<p><pre><code>    demo=> create table q (data int);
    CREATE TABLE
    demo=> begin; select txid_current();
    BEGIN
    189028
    demo=> insert into q (data) values (0); commit;
    INSERT 0 1
    COMMIT
    demo=> begin; select xmin, xmax, data from q;
    BEGIN
    189028|0|0
</code></pre>
Now, while this new transaction is still open, from a second connection, I'm going to create a new transaction in which I am going to update this row to set the value it is storing to 1 from 0, and then commit. In the first connection, as we are still in a ""snapshot"" (I put this term in quotes, as MVCC is obviously not copying the entire database when a transaction begins) from a transaction started before that update, we will not see the update happen, but the hidden xmax column (which stores the transaction in which the row is deleted) will be updated.<p>Connection 2:<p><pre><code>    demo=> begin; select txid_current();
    BEGIN
    189029
    demo=> update q set data = 1; commit;
    UPDATE 1
    COMMIT
    demo=> select xmin, xmax, data from q;
    189029|0|1
</code></pre>
Connection 1:<p><pre><code>    demo=> select xmin, xmax, data from q;
    189028|189029|0
</code></pre>
As you can see, the data that the other transaction was referencing has not been destroyed: the old row (the one with the value 0) is still there, but the xmax column has been updated to indicate that this column no longer exists for transactions that began after 189029 committed. However, at the same time, the new row (with the value 1) also exists, with an xmin of 189029: transactions that begin after 189029 committed will see that row instead. No data was destroyed: and this data is persisted this way to disk (it isn't just stored in memory).<p>My contention then is that it should be a fairly simple matter to take a transaction and backdate when it began. As far as I know, there is no reason that this would cause any serious problems as long as a) it was done before the transaction updated or inserted any data, b) there have been no vacuums during the backdated period, c) HOT (heap-only tuple) updates are disabled (in essence, this is an optimization designed to do online vacuuming), and <i>maybe</i> d) the new transaction is read only (although I am fairly confident this would not be a requirement).<p>For a more complete implementation, one would then want to be able to build transactions (probably read-only ones; I imagine this would cause serious problems if used from a writable transaction, and that really isn't required) that ""saw all data as if all data in the database was alive"", which I also believe would be a pretty simple hack: you just take the code that filters dead rows from being visible based on these comparisons and add a transaction feature that lets you turn them off. You could then use the already-implemented xmin and xmax columns to do your historical lookups.<p>P.S. BTW, if you want to try that demo at home, to get that behavior you need to use the ""repeatable read"" isolation level, which uses the start of the transaction as the boundary as opposed to the start of the query. This is not the default; you might then wonder if it is because it is expensive and requires a lot more coordination, and as far as I know the answer is ""no"". In both cases, all of the data is stored and is tagged with the transaction identifiers: the difference is only in what is considered the reference time to use for ""which of the rows is alive"".<p>However, it does mean that a transaction that attempts to update a value that has been changed from another transaction will fail, even if the updating transaction had not previously read the state of the value; as most reasonable usages of a database actually work fine with the relaxed semantics that ""data truly committed before the query executes"" provides (as that still wouldn't allow data you update to be concurrently and conflictingly updated by someone else: their update would block) and those semantics are not subject to ""this transaction is impossible"" errors.<p>Both Connections (setup):<p><pre><code>    demo=> set session characteristics as transaction isolation level repeatable read;

Companies that I've been involved with often do this at first, because at first, everyone SHOULD do support. After a few years, it's horribly unproductive.

Rotating support isn't just bad for your developers, it's a horrible way to support your customers. One week you have a problem that gets resolved quickly because the guy on support actually wrote the code that you are having a problem with. The next week, the same support call takes three days because the guy on support has no idea where that code even lives and has to learn the process. You might say 'oh, but that's how we cross train', to which I, as a customer, point out that those three days I had to wait for an answer were unacceptable, and you should have a better plan on cross training than 'wait til something breaks and throw completely clueless resources at it'.",1346242958

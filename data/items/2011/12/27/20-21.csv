The idea of having an isolated, self-sufficient colony in the Oort cloud seems like an even poorer version of North Korea, except you'd have to ship all the people out there.<p>There's no good analogy with colonialism on Earth, because most of that involved getting very very rich by trading with the mother country, and if there's anything to be won, economically, from the moon or the astroid belt or even the Oort cloud, it'll be from Earth trade. As far out as the Oort cloud, you'd be better off sending robots than human colonists for the very same reasons you point out.",1325019572
3397392,comment,3396669,3396669,15,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think this article would be stronger if it didn't open with its weakest example: The problem with whiteboard pens is that (a) they wear out over time as the ink dries, so you can't solve your problem by buying and distributing them in one large batch; you need to constantly and continuously resupply them over time; and (b) they can be instantly ruined by misusing them, e.g. by not capping one tightly when you put it down.<p>So I'd argue that whiteboard pens are frustratingly close to the category boundary between ""things that are so cheap that you should just buy them in bulk and spread them all over the environment"" and ""precious personal tools, where the optimal strategy is to buy the best that you can afford, carry them around with you in a special holster, and never let anyone else touch them on pain of death"". The latter category includes things like a chef's knife, a mechanic's micrometer, a microsurgeon's favorite tweezers, and your cellphone.<p>Whiteboard pens are legendarily annoying because they're not <i>clearly</i> in one category or the other, so no matter whether you fanatically carry around a personal set or choose to rely on their ubiquity you're inevitably going to end up kicking yourself at one time or another.",1325019543

3397385,comment,3394600,3397295,2,0,psychotik,,,"One other option to look at, if you aren't already, is to freeze new feature development and allocate most resources to making the platform solid. You didn't state that in your list above.<p>You may be correct that you've done a lot to stabilize it during the last year, but how does that compare with the amount of new features you've added over the last year? Maybe Facebook just isn't good at producing bug-free code, and it's time to improve things you do before actually shipping a feature? Continuing to ""ship fast, break fast"" clearly hasn't worked when it comes to Platform - are you doing anything to fix that?<p>As an anecdote, Microsoft had a similar problems with Security of their OS - it was a much more severe problem. They took a similar approach to the one you've outlined, for many years - furiously developing new features while scrambling to patch security. However, in the early 2000s (2002?), after a particular severe worm hit computers all over the world, they completely froze all new development on the OS. They did their famous 'security push' where almost every engineer focused on security for many months. They revamped tools and invented technologies to make sure products are more secure out the gate, and the result was a resounding success.<p>Developer frustration with the Facebook Platform is very real - a competitor with a stable API might actually receive a lot of support from the community. Maybe Facebook needs its own version of Microsoft's 'security push'.",1325019434

How about PHP sites, do you deploy them as packages?<p>There is a chasm dividing OS management and app management. The OS is the province of sysadmins, but apps are the province of developers. Ideally you want to bridge the two by having the environment ""contain"" the app, in a way that lets an application be automatically deployed from the newest code (eg., from Git), coordinated by an external system (eg., Jenkins), running inside an environment controlled by the configuration management system (eg., Puppet).",1325019410

3397361,comment,3397253,3397253,16,0,LogicX,,,"TL;DR: You have a fine point to test a new domain's resolving status using dig +trace to not poison your cache.  Existing domains need not apply.<p>You may need to explain your theory on your own website, to bring it back up under this load elsewhere... I can't get to your article because its down, but I see you have your TTL set to 72 hours:<p><pre><code>  www.simonluijk.com.	259200	IN	CNAME	simonluijk.com.\n  simonluijk.com.		259200	IN	A	46.102.244.108\n</code></pre>\nWhatever you wrote in your article... the 'myth' aspect has to do with everyone's TTLs involved... many of which are out of your control: ex: the listing of your domain in the TLD:<p><pre><code>  simonluijk.com.		172800	IN	NS	a.ns.zerigo.net.\n  simonluijk.com.		172800	IN	NS	b.ns.zerigo.net.\n  simonluijk.com.		172800	IN	NS	d.ns.zerigo.net.\n  simonluijk.com.		172800	IN	NS	c.ns.zerigo.net.\n  ;; Received 261 bytes from 192.12.94.30#53(e.gtld-servers.net) in 114 ms\n</code></pre>\nWhich I see is set at 48hours...<p>So someone could have a combination of 48 hour TTL cache'd response for your domain's DNS servers, and 72 hour cache'd response by your own DNS servers for your record.  Thats not even taking in to account resolvers which ignore the TTL values and substitute their own.<p>Update: Finally got your article to load.  Yes, for a brand new domain, manually testing resolution using dig +trace first, until you confirm it works (avoiding poisoning your cache with a negative response) is a fine suggestion.<p>Surely the registrar warnings exist for the more likely scenarios of any changes to existing domains. Added TL;DR at the top.<p>Update 2: Removed alternative resolver rants, and updated to emphasize the dig +trace option - as per author's comment below, and original article.",1325019165

Specifically, we are removing FBML (<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/568/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/568/</a>), deprecating the REST API (<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/616/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/616/</a>), moving to support OAuth 2.0/HTTPs (<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/oauth2-https-migration/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/oauth2-https-migration/</a>) across the board and deciding what SDKs we are really going to support.  These changes are painful for us and developers, but necessary to provide the level of support developers expect.<p>Ironically, it is the OAuth migration that is responsible for the JavaScript SDK bug reported in the post.  We introduced this bug went we added the OAuth code path.  This bug is on deck to be fixed soon, however (there is a straightforward workaround in the meantime).<p>In terms of the source of JavaScript SDK, we are working through the right approach to ensure that developers get access to the non-minified source (which I agree we need to do for debugging).  It is unlikely that we will do this via GitHub, but we are looking at just having it off our CDN with the minified version as an option.<p>As for the bug process, I'll say two things.  First, we now have a dedicated team of engineers devoted to supporting developers. If you have been developing on Facebook Platform for a while, the fact that bugs are getting daily responses is a vast improvement.  We have a _long_ way to go, but we are listening and fixing.  I will note that we are still working through the process on how we respond to various issues and how the bug tool (something we launched this year) works -- this seems to be evidenced from the post and something I am following up on.  Second, just because the reporter can repro it, it doesn't mean we can, even with the steps that you provide.  Our team of support engineers tries to repro every single issue that gets reported.  Often, they simply can't and need more information.<p>I'll close by saying the following:<p>1. We care about our developers and the API.<p>2. We have done more this year than we have ever done to help developers and keep the platform stable.<p>3. That said, we still have a long way to go and these things do not change overnight.<p>4. If anyone has issue with how a bug is getting handled or any other issue with Facebook Platform, you can always ping me on Facebook (www.facebook.com/dmp) or dmp@fb.com.",1325018293

By avoiding recruiters, you are passing up one avenue for possible job offers.  For the few startups that do use a recruiter, they have already agreed to the terms, and believe that it is a worthwhile investment to get someone good.

Computers would obviously do the heavy lifting anyway (calculating burn times).  An algorithm knows no fear, shows no mercy, and does not flee or surrender unless programmed to do so.  The only thing left is target selection, and it doesn't seem worth bringing a human along just for that.<p>2) If you don't need to put humans on warships, then you quickly realize you don't need a warship at all.  Just send a bunch of missiles from wherever the warship would have launched.  It's harder to take them all out at once with a ""mine"" or something.  You also get to build more missiles if you don't need to build the warship.  Sure, you might attach a collective nuclear rocket ""booster"" to many missiles to build that initial velocity. There's no need for that rocket to be anything more than an engine temporarily attached to the missiles.  It's also not really required to begin with.<p>3) If you're sending lots of missiles, there's no reason for them to be any larger than the smallest size permitted by design and manufacturing practicalities.  For something that amounts to a liquid-fueled rocket, that smallest size is preposterously small.  A liquid-fueled rocket can be fit into an object the size of a soda can with current technology.  This makes the notion of point defense completely laughable:  divert ten thousand missiles out of one hundred thousand, and you've reduced the incoming energy by 10%.",1325017424

If there's an equivalent insult in this case, it's ""aspie.""<p>Men might be able to be aggressive with no fear of being called a bitch, but that's minor compared to the other consequences that face by being aggressive.<p>> You have to be an order of magnitude more aggressive to be an ""asshole"" than you do to be a ""bitch.""<p>One caveat being that for men, balancing aggression and restraint tend to be learned early and if there's no reason to challenge the hierarchy there's no reason to be aggressive.  Women, on the other hand, who are thrust into male-dominated environments without understanding the rules may fail in a variety of ways.  They may fail to use appropriate body language.  Their voice might betray too much emotional investment in the outcome.  They may persist on unwinnable points where men would back down (iow fail to choose their battles effectively).<p>If you've dealt with successfully aggressive women, they are rarely called ""bitch"" unless they are truly hostile or by angry people who have lost control and pick the first insult that comes to mind (see the movie 'Crash' for some excellent examples of this phenomenon as it applies to racism).  Typically you will notice that these women are comfortable adopting male body language, probably have a deep and confident voice, and are far more emotionally restrained than average women.  They are typically physically intimidating (a saleswoman or CEO). They are capable of aggression and assertiveness without being called a bitch because they have learned to do it in a masculine way.<p>What women can't do is be aggressive without sacrificing femininity.<p>> I can be loud with no fear of being called a shrew<p>Women who are loud in the way that men are loud are never called shrews.

I read the page you linked to, but that didn't list actual numbers based on asteroid searches.<p>There's an estimated 4,000,000 asteroids in the solar system of size 300m or larger.

If Apple releases a significantly improved iPad 3 on Steve Jobs' Birthday like the rumors suggest, then whatever Amazon releases around the same time couldn't possibly compete with it. However, Amazon has shows signs of trying to establish a regular release cycle just like apple has. If this is the case then eventually they should be able to catch up a little.

If you focus on understanding how to build quality tests, the rest will just fall into place as you progress. The tests will help you keep your hands around the entire application as it grows in complexity and also help you build better code. Find some popular new open source Rails apps and sift through how they're handling routes. How do they organize their controller code? How do they build their models?

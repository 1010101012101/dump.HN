431740,comment,431285,431570,0,0,gruseom,,,"By the way (I can't resist one more comment), apropos this:<p><i>The nice thing I see in XML is that it abstracts out grammars (using XML Schema / DTD)</i><p>Have you ever used XML Schema on a real project? I tried, on a nice meaty project, for perhaps a year. It turned out to be as awful to work with in practice as it sounds good in theory. It's the kind of thing people write design specs for, and then after the standards are ratified they write books about it, without ever actually themselves building anything. Meanwhile, pity the poor schmucks who get the book and try to use it on a real system, wondering what they're doing wrong for a year until they finally figure out that the problem isn't them.<p>To give you an example: what happens when you give one of these systems a chunk of data that doesn't match its nicely specified schema? Well, with the tools we were using at the time, you get something like ""Error type error the int at position 34,1 of element XSD:typeSpec:int32 type invalid blah blah blah"". What can a system do with that other than tell its poor user, ""Invalid data""?<p>Now I suppose you'll tell me that we just picked the wrong validator. :)",1231829445

(2) Lispers tend to be multi-lingual; they'll use other languages when appropriate.  If XMLers can only work in XML....<p>>This is, what XML and SGML people have done for decades<p>Decades?  20 years/two decades ago is 1988.  The first draft of XML is roughly 1998/10 years later/one decade ago.  GML, a predecessor to SGML, didn't become public until 73 but the ""multiple use"" stuff was still in the future.<p>SGML rode the WWW wave, but that didn't happen for technical reasons.",1231829010

Doing an exercise like the strategy maps in ""Blue Ocean Strategy"" comes to mind as something that might be worthwhile.<p>Features != user experience.  Two sites can have exactly the same feature set but their value and popularity can be determined by completely different factors.<p>I should also note that you have a huge opportunity here: if his/your feature sets are that similar, you can observe how folks are using those features before even launching.

431735,comment,431703,431703,0,0,aneesh,,,"I'd recommend getting started in the following order:<p><pre><code>  1) Familiarity with Unix & shell scripting
  2) A scripting language (Python/Ruby/Perl)
  3) C

If you have more time, learn C++/Java, and a functional language.  From a motivation standpoint, it might be helpful to learn a language with a specific task/project in mind (ie, I want to learn Python to make a webapp that does XYZ).<p>Also, check out <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>",1231828890

431727,comment,431603,431705,0,0,mhartl,,,"<i>It sounds like the tests are too easy.</i><p>You might be right that much or most of the higher pass rate is due to higher attendance, but it's also possible that students were learning plenty from section, the book, and working on problem sets.  When I taught the analogous course (Physics 1) at Caltech, many of the students skipped lecture entirely.  The failure rate was typically under 5%, and I guarantee it wasn't because the tests were easy.<p>One student I remember took it all the way: he skipped everything, including homework (which counted for 20% of the grade), but he got <i>perfect</i> scores on all four quizzes and on the final exam.  According to the numbers he had an A- because of the 0 on homework, but everyone in the grading room agreed that was absurd, and so we gave him a flat A instead.",1231827972

String processing (manipulating text) was, for me, a comfortable place to start. Python is a great first language to learn and will let you explore just about every nook and cranny of computer science you find interesting. Pick up a Python book, work through the first several chapters. Then come up with a simple problem <i>you</i> want to solve. If you enjoy solving problems, stick with it -- a programmer you may be!",1231827906

431719,comment,431703,431703,0,0,shutter,,,"Start with the basics. Ensure you understand general concepts well before progressing to the details of specific programming languages. Take a trip to your local bookstore and spend a couple hours reading the beginning of several books on programming. I recommend starting with Python because it will remain useful throughout your career while providing a shallow learning curve and stable library, but language choice matters less than the concepts.<p>I recommend staying away from Microsoft's .NET and other proprietary languages for now; focus instead on more open tools. You'll attain more versatile skills that way.",1231827154

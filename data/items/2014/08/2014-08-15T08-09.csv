Yes, there are people who actually do the kinds of things anonymous does. I don&#x27;t also doubt that there are people who seek to discredit and marginalize people who identify with the notion of Anonymous by intentionally masquerading as members of Anonymous and acting egregiously irresponsible to the point it becomes so remarkable that the news must report on Anonymous unfavorably. We&#x27;ve all seen stories of real people arrested for irresponsible behavior, and we&#x27;ve also seen enough leaks like the HB Gary one to know that there are numerous active efforts at sock puppetry.<p>At the end of the day, without identities and verifiable facts, none of this is news. It&#x27;s hearsay. I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s right and wrong here. You don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s right and wrong here.

College has pretty much boiled down to institutional prestige and the credential that comes with it.<p>Gauging &quot;success&quot; within this system seems hard. It&#x27;s hard to attribute success to a university when it&#x27;s prestige ends up determining the calibre of its student body in the first place. And a clear feedback loop exists here. On account of the prestige associated with their college, students end up leading illustrious careers. Their &quot;success&quot; is a combination of their inherent pre-college skill and their credential, one could say.<p>Now, given the Minerva project, where the feedback loop doesn&#x27;t exist and the quality of students are towards the higher side, how does one begin to test the efficiency of a new system without any proper control experiment?<p>Because of this difficulty in assessing the success or failure of this project, even though I hope and believe it works well, the general opinion might be that it failed.",1408092681

We&#x27;ve managed to get all those resolved for the Runtime part (Mac/Windows/Linux standalone players) a while ago (we&#x27;ve been adding 64 bit versions of those during the 3.x and 4.x release cycles), which meant getting Mono, PhysX, FMOD, Substance, etc all working on 64 bit. For the editor, however, there are a lot more third party libraries involved (such as a web browser engine for the asset store), not all of which had 64 bit versions to start with.

Ultimately, this story is about not only for-profit law schools, or law schools, or even for-profit higher education. It is about the problematic financial structure of higher education in America today. It would be comforting to think that the crisis is confined to for-profit schools—and indeed this idea is floated regularly by defenders of higher education’s status quo. But it would be more accurate to say that for-profit schools, with their unabashed pursuit of money at the expense of their students’ long-term futures, merely throw this crisis into particularly sharp relief. To see why, consider the regulatory and political mechanisms that have allowed InfiLaw to make such handsome profits while producing disastrous results for so many of its “customers.”<p>[...]<p>> What, after all, is the difference between the InfiLaw schools and Michigan’s Thomas M. Cooley, or Boston’s New England Law, or Chicago’s John Marshall, or San Diego’s Thomas Jefferson? All of these law schools feature student bodies with poor academic qualifications and terrible job prospects relative to their average debt. In recent years, as law-school applications have collapsed, all of these schools have, just like the InfiLaw schools, cut their already low admissions standards. And, like Florida Coastal, Arizona Summit, and Charlotte, all of these schools now have a very high percentage of students who, given their LSAT scores, are unlikely to ever pass the bar. Ultimately, what difference does it make that none of these schools produce profit in the technical (and taxable) sense, because they are organized as nonprofits?<p>> The only real difference between for-profit and nonprofit schools is that while for-profits are run for the benefit of their owners, nonprofits are run for the benefit of the most-powerful stakeholders within those institutions.",1408092128

8181391,comment,8181365,8181365,3,0,lutusp,,,"The problems with testing a microwave oven&#x27;s shieding effectiveness using a cell phone are legion:<p>1. The frequencies used by cell phones (typically 0.8 GHz in the U.S.) aren&#x27;t the same as those used by an oven&#x27;s magnetron (2.45 GHz), so we&#x27;re comparing apples and oranges. The only valid test of shielding must necessarily use the same frequency as the microwave&#x27;s magnetron.<p>2. The signal attenuation required to render a cell phone inoperative is not nearly enough to assure a person&#x27;s safety when a magnetron is in operation. A power attenuation of 20 db (meaning reduction by a factor of 100) will almost certainly render a cell phone inoperative, but cannot assure safety to a person standing near a typical consumer microwave oven generating 0.7 kilowatts (700 watts) of microwave power and therefore emitting 7 watts into its immediate environment.<p>I emphasize the second example is hypothetical, meant only to show that an attenuation more than adequate to prevent the cell phone from working, is not nearly enough to assure a person&#x27;s safety, not that this is a typical microwave oven leakage power.",1408091552

Also, wrt credentialing, CS is uncommon even among STEM fields; most engineering jobs <i>strictly</i> require credentials.<p>Education and mathematics are both liberal arts by most definitions, but in my experience, graduates in those subjects get jobs by merit rather than network or credential at least as often as in CS. (edit: in fact, based on what I&#x27;ve seen, education is far more meritocratic in the hiring process than CS.)<p>Finally, &quot;liberal arts&quot; can refer to the field, but it can also refer to the type of institution.

Many bioactive molecules are fat-soluble.  Just because a substance is fat-soluble doesn&#x27;t mean it can be stored indefinitely and readily metabolized.<p>> The real reason Pot is still illegal is that it is dangerous to those who aren&#x27;t consuming it. A stoned Doctor might not smell of it, might not have any real outwards signs, and then could get the giggles when he nicked an artery.<p>I disagree with you 100% here.  I can tell when someone is stoned, regardless of physical side-effects, changes in mentality or demeanor, etc.<p>Regardless, in my opinion, your argument crumbles if we clarify stoned to be under the influence of well-concealed alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates, excessive stimulants, or, hell, maybe even ketamine, methaqualone, etc.<p>I (unfortunately, I suppose) have had experiences with pretty much every drug and RC under the sun, and I personally think it&#x27;s very easy to detect when someone is under the influence of marijuana compared to any of the substances thereof (well, maybe except the dissociatives or excessive alcohol).",1405133977

You&#x27;ll note that it was actually the previous poster who had made the speaker the subject, and that was in the context of a remark about how he was being reflexively down-voted for (presumably) making conspicuously bad arguments.<p>Bear in mind that it was failures of reasoning like these - that is to say, ones grounded in distinctly personal shortcomings - that produced the situation at Pixar which we&#x27;re discussing. Indeed, for those of us whose careers have taught us the importance of making suitably judicious assessments of the <i>personal character</i> of those we depend on, a discussion of the rhetorical hallmarks of people who defend illegal and abusive employment practices is vitally important. Spotting them quickly can be the difference between a really bad choice and a good one. So again, that&#x27;s why I was saying there&#x27;s value in cookiecaper&#x27;s otherwise objectionable remarks: they&#x27;re a case study in the kind of stuff you really do need to watch out for.<p>And within the specific social context I noted - i.e. people working in HR - remarks like cookiecaper&#x27;s jolly well <i>should</i> him an untouchable outcast. For the same reason you don&#x27;t want a person with a lax attitude about embezzling anywhere near your finance department, you don&#x27;t want a person who thinks that contracts are &quot;inconvenient&quot; in a position where they&#x27;re likely to conclude that violating the law &quot;is just a lot faster and easier&quot; than respecting it. (I&#x27;m paraphrasing, but that&#x27;s the essence of the &quot;reasoning&quot; on display.)<p>Now perhaps you don&#x27;t consider a frank characterization of the sub-par ethical traits that are the direct cause of problems like Pixar&#x27;s to be &quot;substantive&quot;.

If the shares you short sold are recalled by the lender, then your broker will attempt to find replacement shares to borrow. If no replacement shares can be found, you will be notified and can either buy the shares back yourself or your broker will perform a &quot;buy in&quot; (i.e. force you to cover the loaned shares at the current price). All of this happens within 3 business days, or less. This happens with some regularity in &quot;hard to borrow&quot; stocks and is a substantive risk to short sellers. The lender also has the option to &quot;rerate&quot; the loan instead of an outright &quot;recall&quot; ... short sellers must pay interest to borrow shares and the interest rate is set by the lender, which which can be very high in &quot;hard to borrow&quot; stocks and can be increased at any time by the lender.

But... advocates of disruption have an affinity for circular arguments. If an established company doesn’t disrupt, it will fail, and if it fails it must be because it didn’t disrupt. When a startup fails, that’s a success, since epidemic failure is a hallmark of disruptive innovation. ... When an established company succeeds, that’s only because it hasn’t yet failed. And, when any of these things happen, all of them are only further evidence of disruption.&quot; It works well only in retrospect, and it can&#x27;t be disproven.

But this is probably a market where they work, because, well, they exist. Smart people entered into them despite being on notice that they were probably illegal.<p>To clarify cost of entry: let&#x27;s say the employees here are wheat farmers. There are hundreds of wheat farmers and five companies that buy wheat to make bread. Those companies compete to buy as much wheat as possible so they can enter as many markets as possible while still making a profit. So they drive up the price, and end up paying roughly as much for the wheat as the value it contributes to the bread-making enterprise. Those are market forces, and the capitalist notion is that they fairly distribute profits among all the people involved -- but they reduce the profits of the five companies.<p>So let&#x27;s say the five companies get together and agree to split up the wheat and only pay 80% of the market price. All of their profits go up, all the wheat farmers&#x27; profits go down, market forces are no longer operating -- and therefore the agreement is illegal. It&#x27;s cool if that isn&#x27;t obvious to everyone, since it&#x27;s not exactly relevant in most of our lives -- but anyone who&#x27;s allowed to run a market-leading company has probably had the concept mentioned to them at some point.<p>But so now the other market forces you&#x27;re referring to come into play: the five companies have created an opportunity. If some sixth player (like Sony Bread Co.) is willing to come into the market and pay 90%, they can get all the wheat at below market price. This is great for Sony because they get cheap labor without even having to break the law, but it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem for the wheat farmers. Only if a lot of other players have the same idea will they drive the price back up to the free-market level.<p>But that assumes the 20% entry bonus created by the illegal cartel is enough to overcome their competitive advantage from already being in the market. Becoming Disney isn&#x27;t free -- and this kind of cartel is something, pretty much by definition, that you would only go for if you thought you and your compatriots had the market locked down. And you would only drive the price down as far as you thought your competitive advantage could defend.<p>So, no -- market forces are not a magic wand to make agreements designed to nullify market forces OK.",1405131444

That individuals in group G fare worse in situation S, all other things being equal, than individuals in other groups? If you have a better reading, please let me know. If not, we have disembarked too far from the cognitive for bias, an inherently cognitive thing, as our explanation.<p>Look at my name and call me a hammer-nail guy, but here&#x27;s what I think: it comes down to options - yours, others&#x27;, your expectation of others&#x27;, theirs of yours, and most especially the resulting interplay of all of the above.\nHuman beings are the situation you put them in.<p>You and I (and Max Temkin and Julian Assange) have a grounded reason for a general fear of false rape accusation: that option is available to any woman we&#x27;ve ever spent an hour with. Is any individual, no matter her motivations, terribly likely to exercise that option? No, but that&#x27;s not the disturbing part. The disturbing part is, there&#x27;s no recourse once they do - no options.<p>But why! Why are there no options? Because rape is the exact thing that it is: a grievous crime whose lasting scars are emotional more often than physical. Anything else, it&#x27;s different: show me the dead body, show me the stolen thing, what have you. If you&#x27;re a woman, and some dude rapes you but somehow there&#x27;s no physical scarring and no dna and no webcam recording and no witnesses-- an altogether plausible scenario, we can all agree-- then fuck you, says the legal system. No options. Not that the legal system has an option in the matter either; you can&#x27;t have a system that sends people to jail for decades on testimony without evidence. No options here, no options there, no options everywhere, for everyone.<p>We, by which I mean the public, tend to believe the accuser, in my personal opinion, a) because some fraction of the public is women who have been exactly there, with no options, and see themselves in the accuser (regardless of whatever the real truth of the matter may be), and b) <i>because</i> they don&#x27;t believe their voice matters anyway. Perhaps secretly, but all the same. Your girlfriend&#x27;s opinion on Ben Roethlisberger&#x27;s guilt of rape will, she is well aware, have zero legal effect.

3122869,comment,3111916,3118819,1,0,joelhaus,,,"We seem to be talking past each-other, but I'll take the bait. If I understand correctly, you seem to be saying that corporations should be afforded all of the same rights as individual citizens. While certain rights (e.g. freedom from unjust seizure, trial rights, etc.) are important, on the whole, I disagree. Maybe that's where we differ, but I'm not sure if this is the point you are getting around to making.<p>To make my position more clear, I do not believe that corporations should be afforded all of the same rights as citizens. History has shown this to be true: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)</a>. In order for capitalism to succeed and our economy to prosper, we need a proper regulatory environment that can protect the interests of individual citizens against organized groups of individuals (e.g. corporations). It is not enough to leave corporations to self-regulate because too often, our interests dramatically diverge. And again, this isn't an easy task, but I believe that it is one worthy of effort.<p>N.B. <i>I'm not all that interested in defending this point any further, but would be happy to hear you make an argument for it, as I haven't heard many great defenses of the ""corporation as citizen"" argument.</i><p>Regarding the Citizens United ruling; here's what the Wikipedia article has to say on this case:<p><pre><code>  The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, striking
  down those provisions of the McCainFeingold Act that
  prohibited all corporations, both for-profit and
  not-for-profit, and unions from broadcasting
  ""electioneering communications."" An ""electioneering
  communication"" was defined in McCainFeingold as a
  broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that
  mentioned a candidate within 60 days of a general
  election or thirty days of a primary.
</code></pre>
From where I sit, this ruling removes barriers from corporations making political contributions (I'm not as concerned as you are with the medium that the electioneering communications are distributed in). This means that they are now better able to lobby for legislation that benefits them to the detriment of their young/upstart competitors (as someone posting on a board related to startups, I'm surprised that this doesn't concern you too). Again, this story was a good illustration of legislation benefiting the entrenched/monied interests over the interests of individual citizens. While it would be nice if the world were perfect, it isn't and we must deal with the realities presented to us.",1318892281

People seem to upvote when something should be upvoted (my guess is that this topped out before if someone thought a comment had too many votes).

3122860,comment,3122054,3122525,2,0,dctoedt,,,"> <i>I'm not sure the courts take reexaminations seriously as a defense.</i><p>That generally depends in part on how far along the court case is when the reexamination request is filed.<p>On one hand, federal judges want to keep their cases moving; they themselves are judged by the peers (reputationally only; they have life tenure) in part by their average time to final disposition.  If an accused infringer files a reexamination request in the USPTO just as its infringement case is about to go to trial, the chances are the judge might order the trial to proceed anyway.<p>On the other hand, a reexamination proceeding could make a case go away, or even just narrow the triable issues significantly. That would free up the judge and his or her law clerks to work on other cases.<p>And random factors can make a difference.  I once had a judge fast-track a patent case about programmable thermostats. He did so because one of his law clerks that year had his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering. The judge wanted to finish the case while that law clerk was still around to help him. The law clerk informed me and the other side of this at the first case management conference; he also noted for the record that my law firm had turned him down the previous year when he applied for a job with us; ouch ....

3122849,comment,3122689,3122689,4,0,JangoSteve,,,"In the startup world, I often hear very anti-office-space sentiment (either ""don't get it"" or ""learn to rough it / cheaper is better""). I think this may be the after effects of the bubble, but that's an entirely different topic. Instead, I'll provide a slightly different perspective.<p>When deciding whether or not to buy office space (and how much to spend), I converted rent dollars to productive hours. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that you are a one-person startup (as I was), and that you could easily get contracting gigs for $100/hr. Heck, let's be more conservative and consider $75/hr. Again, for the sake of simplicity, let's assume that your time spent on the startup is equally valuable as your time would be spent consulting.<p>In Michigan, a nice office costs around $400/mo. So, in order for this office to pay itself off, it must help me produce an extra ~5.5hr/mo of billable work (i.e. productivity). This amounts to around 11 extra minutes of productivity per day. This doesn't take into account other things like mental outlook, well-being, company attitude, etc.<p>So, in my scenario, I decided 2 years ago that yes, an office would add 11 extra minutes of productivity to my day. This is a decision each person must consider, as it's not one-solution-fits-all. And for a startup team, you must take into account everyone's individual productivity in addition to group productivity.<p>In my experience, I love having an awesome office and it's helped me through the day many times. However, I'm also constantly (and at time, painfully) aware of the cost of this luxury. For example, I still do more consulting than I'd probably prefer.",1318891791

If there isn't a good way of assessing which comments are deemd good by the community is the system working properly?<p>- When a poster postulates something and is refuted by a sibling it's impossible to know who is right. Points give you a gauge of what HN as a community thinks. For instance, if a user comments that you should always use Bcrypt and a sibling replies that this is simply wrong I don't know what is right and wrong, even though it may be obvious to someone knowledgeable in encryption. Points give you a good header.<p>- When you don't show points people tend to vote less. Without having seen the numbers I'm confident that voting has decreased significantly. If noone is voting (or even worse, only a subset of opiniated users vote) then we're back to a threaded discussion ordered by randomness.<p>- As I remember it one of the original reasons for hiding points was to stop the ""piling on"" where already popular comments got more upvotes. You posted at some point that comments which had a lot of points before actually have <i>more</i> points after the don't-show-points change.<p>Hiding scores to reduce arguments seems like a very crude and inelegant way of solving the problem.

3122672,comment,3118620,3120527,2,0,kragen,,,"> Python is a general purpose language, and scientific computing is a single domain.<p>I think this is shortsighted to the point of ignorance.  ""Scientific computing"" here really means ""performance-critical numerical computation on regular arrays"".  Basically all of the <i>new</i> things that people are doing with computers in the last five years and the next five years — machine learning and other statistics, software-defined radio, audio synthesis, real-time video processing, cool visual effects, speech recognition, machine vision, and 3-D rendering, and arguably Bitcoin — consist largely of performance-critical numerical computation on regular arrays.  It's what GPUs are for.  Five years ago, Numeric or NumPy was probably the best way to do that for a wide range of things, although a lot of people still use Matlab instead, and R deserves at least a mention.  Today it's not clear.  Five years from now there will be something much better than current NumPy, and it could be a better version of NumPy or it could be R or Matlab or Octave or something.<p>In short, ""scientific computing"" is not a single domain, but a set of capabilities increasingly important in many different domains.",1318888962

An SF author posits scientifically plausibe scenarios and shows his/her work. Gibson's novels about cyberspace and that relied extensively on handwaving, magical thinking, and ""unseen, unknown threat"" to develop their narratives.<p>This isn't negative. Gibson probably knows more about computers than you. Hint: Rather than look at technical details, he has always thought about computers from the most critical perspective: at the points where they interact with people.",1318888823

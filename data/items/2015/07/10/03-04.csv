9862231,comment,9861966,9861966,0,0,BuckRogers,,,"What problem does this solve? It does not solve the multicore &quot;problem&quot;. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this proposal. A few reasons.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really add much that wasn&#x27;t possible before, and doesn&#x27;t really solve any technical or PR issue. The PR issue will never be resolved with CPython, those people who don&#x27;t understand it are free to write multithreaded Java apps.\nBut I think explicitly spinning up pthreads should be reserved for writing systems software. I&#x27;m assuming subinterpreters means they&#x27;ll be allocated as pthreads because this is meant to &quot;use all your cores&quot;. Looking forward, this proposal sounds great as long as we&#x27;re on 4 or 8 cores max, at a certain point this solution starts to look like something like a gimmicky ideal created to fit the technology way back in 2015. The ultimate multicore and multinode solution at a non-systems level, if we really need every single language to solve that specific problem- would be Erlang&#x27;s approach.<p>It&#x27;s yet more technical churn rather than innovation in a language (Python3), that was born of technical churn.<p>To offer something constructive as well, I think an ideal solution would be to find a more implicit approach. Think gevent for pthreads or subinterpreters. That would be a lot more work to figure out, this proposal looks more like a hack. I don&#x27;t think this type of &quot;improvement&quot; will draw people to Python3 either, I wish they&#x27;d stop throwing crap at the wall seeing what will stick. Constantly expanding the language, which is bad. The core dev team doesn&#x27;t know what to do, but usually in that case it&#x27;s better to do nothing. Thus Python3 is looking more and more like a playground or experimental branch as time goes on. I&#x27;m increasingly thinking my &quot;Python3 migration&quot; will be to Swift or Go.",1436500563

Not to mention that &quot;great&quot; is a normative concept and who&#x27;s standards are we talking here, yours or others?  Do you want to be perceived as great in the eyes of others?  Many people do and they &quot;succeed&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t make them happy.

Perhaps you hold back for ego-protection and don&#x27;t apply yourself lest you discover this fact.<p>You can see that your question is a bit complex and ultimately can only be answered by you. Nevertheless, I think I can help you in your quest by sharing an observation I&#x27;ve made about others.  There are at least two types of fundamentally unhappy people as far as I can tell. The first type (I mentioned above in my first paragraph) are people who have no real self, no standards and just seek, in various ways, the approval of others. It is sad but I know many outwardly successful doctors, lawyers, business leaders, etc that are miserable because they thought being successful in the eyes others would make them happy.<p>The other unhappy class that I observe are people who ended up in jobs or situations that are significantly below their ability.  These are talented people who never applied themselves, coasted through school and early life and then one day found themselves trapped by their poor decisions. They failed to apply their talent, to define who they are and what they would be and make an effort to achieve it. This is the auto mechanic who could have been an engineer or the grocery store clerk who could have been an electrician or a businessman or the plumber who could have been a writer, etc. It is a special kind of hell to be more talented than your job requires and many of these types resort to alcohol or weed to ease the pain.\n(The unhappy doctors and lawyers do too but the requirements of their jobs tends to limit the extent of their drug use)<p>My advice is to find a career commensurate with your talents in a field that you enjoy and don&#x27;t worry about what others think. These are the happiest types in my experience.",1436499804

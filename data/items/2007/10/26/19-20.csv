You need to be sure that you got all of the cases and that you don't inadvertently break anything.  This is yet another reason to start a startup instead of getting a ""real job"" :).",1193428666

People buying new computers without any choice of not getting Windows shows that Vista is very popular? The only reason people are using Vista at all is because it ships with new computers.",1193428108

From what I've been reading, most startups simply crawl away and die anyway. So the only risk you're looking at is 1) your startup is successful, and 2) the cofounder doesn't work out. Seems like that is a bit of a long-shot.<p>I'm not saying the selection doesn't matter -- I think it's the critical factor. What I am saying is that you should learn what makes a good cofounder for you, and that's something you might have to iterate on a bit. Don't sit in indecision wondering what the perfect choice is. <p>\nThat's my plan, for what it's worth.",1193427292

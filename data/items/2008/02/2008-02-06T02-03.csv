110085,comment,110031,110072,0,0,curi,,,"I don't see how that's fair. What non-scientific fields are more reasonable than, say, physicists?<p>Scientists may not be perfect. But they have certain standards, which make them better. For example, scientists have a tradition of disregarding the source of an idea and focussing on examining reasons it is correct or not.<p>Edit: BTW it's ironic that Planck would say that. I think it's pretty clear that his own life, not his death, advanced physics.",1202266767

UMUC is a ""Forbes Favorite"" for online education.  And, while I think that WebTycho, their custom academic CMS system is okay, it's soooo.... 1999.  It could really use a facelift and an upgrade.  Also, towards the end of the semester, the system slows to a crawl.<p>So, yeah, it's  a big problem that's begging to be fixed with something better, but you'd have to sell to Universities and colleges, which would be a nightmare.  Not only do you have to schmooze the right people, the decision would spend months in committee.  And then, implementation would take a long time, because you'd have to interface with whatever legacy database they are using.<p>I can think of a bunch of other ideas I'd rather do in terms of start ups, but if you want to tackle it... more power to you.

It shows that the second law is incorrect in the same way as Newton's theory of gravity was: both are accurate, in their domain of applicability, but neither had such boundaries well defined. Where Newton's law fails for very heavy systems, the second law fails for very small (though by a far smaller amount).",1202265502

To find out, you go all over the country asking people what they think the length of the Emperor of China's nose is, and you average it. And that would be very ""accurate"" because you averaged so many people. But it's no way to find anything out; when you have a very wide range of people who contribute without looking carefully at it, you don't improve your knowledge of the situation by averaging.</i><p>I think tarot cards are a lot simpler and more accurate. Mine suggest that Barack Obama should beware of the tall tower with the lightning bolts, and that a hooded figure carrying three sticks will bring him five golden discs. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton will be menaced by a demon-like creature with the face of Rudy Giuliani, and will fight back by swinging swords at it while blindfolded. Or something.",1202264258

I didn't buy any CD in the last 8 years or so. I used to download all the music I liked (but I still go to concerts). Than emusic came along and I used that, until lots of labels stopped using it and it became more expensive. Now I'm a happy Spotify user. So I didn't download music in the last 4 years or so. The only thing that is left is movies and  TV-series I download a lot (and still go to the movies). I tried Jaman but there is not allot of quality content (I did get 3 credits free but never used it since movies I liked where not available in my country).<p>I would pay 50~100 euro per month for a all you can eat package providing that episodes are available with in a week of first broadcast (not in my country but global) and movies are available with in a month after showing in the theater. I asked around (yes very scientific) and most people would to that to.<p>So I have this money to give to the industry (max 1200 euro per year) but there is no service to give the money to. You could say go rend a movie (if you still can find such a place) but I refuse to pay 5 euro for a sloppy movie (the best movies I see in the theater any ways). You could say buy the movie but I'm not willing to pay 20 euro for a single Blu-ray. If tomorrow I could not download movies and TV-series any more I still wouldn't do that).

3479166,comment,3478850,3478965,5,0,andrewingram,,,"Interestingly, I still pirate shows that are available on iPlayer. Simply because the iPlayer experience is inferior to pirating it. Why? Well, let's see...<p>* iPlayer runs through Flash, it has to because of DRM (the iPhone version gets around this I think). I use a relatively recent Macbook Pro and the playback performance is dreadful. Even on my beasty iMac the HD versions of shows were stuttery at best, so I was forced to use the SD version. Normally I'm quite happy downloading and watching an SD broadcast of a show in full-screen, but in iPlayer the quality of the upscaling is so bad that it's distracting.<p>* Shows are quite often available on torrent sites before they're available through iPlayer (discounting watching content as it airs), this is especially true of HD content.<p>* Despite living in London, my internet connection simply isn't reliable enough to handle streaming without occasional buffering, even with SD. So my preferred approach is to download a show rather than stream it. I've generally found that downloading into iPlayer Desktop is slower than using a torrent site. As well as the fact that VLC doesn't eat my CPU like Adobe Air does.<p>By comparison, I'm a happy customer of Spotify, and I'm more than happy to pay for a video equivalent. I've tried Netflix now that it's out here, but the Silverlight player is as bad as Flash when it comes to CPU usage. The quality of the Netflix streams is pretty poor too, I've yet to manage to get it enable streaming in HD.",1326887495

But it's intent is towards political-neutrality of the internet.<p>I heard from a Herman Chinery-Hesse talk, that African payment transaction systems (used by services like M-Pesa) have redundancy in various countries, so political forces in specific governments can't shut them down completely. It seems that SOPA exploits a weakness of the internet, that ICANN is US-based. How could the pan-African approach be applied into the current DNS system and other systems that SOPA might exploit?<p>For example, to counteract SOPAs potential attempt to control DNS, what would be needed in addition to a hot backup of ICANN's database in Sweden and maybe a few other countries? The OSI-model-friendly way would be to get support of international ISPS to configure different upstream DNS servers, in those downstream from ICANN ""fail"" to provide the requested record. But could breaking the OSI help? In-build browser support for ""backup"" DNS servers? Opt-in by installing an anti-SOPA DNS browser plugins?<p>I'm hoping the question is read as broader than just this example though.

I got great jobs before I completed my degree, and the same after. In fact, the only way my degree comes up in interviews is as a semi-suspicious ""why did you bother, with your track record, it's not as if it matters?"" For me it was a personal choice, not a career choice, and the research project was interesting.<p>The reason I didn't complete my degree in the first place, was that it was so trivially easy to find high paying jobs based on my skills and experience (I started programming at five, and did my first paid development at 13) and nobody <i>ever</i> asked about the lack of a degree. I ended up leaving to do consulting and start a couple of companies.<p>At the same time I also know that none of the places I've worked - including a multi-billion dollar company that certainly had the budget to pay extra well for the degrees if they'd cared to - has placed any preference on people with a CS degree. The few great programmers we've found with good CS degrees have been offered no more because of their degrees than equivalent developers with other degrees or no degree at all. By your argument these people should've gone elsewhere because we'd be offering them well below their market value by offering the same as developers with no degrees, or with say, a Linguistics degree.<p>That idea just does not mesh with any of my experience.<p>> The ones who are really good get hired at better jobs than any that you can offer.<p>The ones that are really good without degrees also get hired really quickly - it doesn't stop me from seeing CV's from, and interviewing, a lot of people like that, many of which we immediately pass on because we know they will get offers much higher than what we're willing to pay.<p>Sure, I don't see many CV's for people who'd be able to claim $1m+ base, either, but people in that range are so few overall that even if every single one of them somehow have CS degrees it would not make much difference.<p>It also ignores the issue of the contents of the CS degrees. See below.<p>> Conversely good people without a CS degree have a hard time getting into those really good jobs, and are therefore available for your sample.<p>Junior developers or mediocre developers without degrees might face more of a challenge without a degree, but for experienced developers, my experience on both sides of the table is that years of experience matters far more when considering whether or not to give an offer, or when discussing remuneration - both when negotiating with technical managers and when negotiating with non-technical HR people.<p>> obviously positive attribute (CS degree)<p>Here you let <i>your</i> bias shine through. Why is it an obviously positive attribute in this setting?<p>Software engineering is <i>not</i> computer science.<p>A big part of the problem I see with CS graduates is that most of them don't have the faintest idea about engineering discipline. Many of them have not had any exposure to testing practices; many have not had any exposure to software design methodologies; many have hardly written any programs, and if they do they often only know one language and don't understand how to generalize the concepts (sure, they know the theoretical underpinnings, but often don't know how to translated that into writing code). Far more don't have much domain knowledge in any fields outside pure CS - it doesn't help if they can write code if they need a business analyst to babysit them all the time.<p>The issue is not that a CS degree makes people bad programmers, but it does very little to make them <i>good</i> programmers and even less to make them good, well rounded software engineers. Many places you can pass through a CS degree without having had more than a passing exposure to programming.<p>At my university, you could've easily get as much programming experience while completing a biology degree (or pretty much any other science related degree; for humanities/liberal arts you'd have to work a bit harder to get there) as in the CS degree, and that's not unusual.<p>Personally, I passed through my entire degree with the equivalent of less than 2-3 months worth of actual programming and I picked a few programming courses on purpose because they were interesting to me (e.g. a class on Smalltalk, and a course on compiler construction), but it would've been trivially easy for me to opt for a more math or theory heavy degree and avoid pretty much all practical programming exposure.<p>And my experience - both from hiring, and from talking to people in the business - is that a lot of people do, and <i>very few</i> go the other way and try to pick subjects that makes them better suited as software developers. Most people that go that way end up picking other degrees - such as going to schools that actually offers software engineering as a subject.<p>But I'm not hiring mathematicians or logicians or people who are meant to run research projects where undergrads do the programming - I'm hiring software developers.<p>While it is perfectly possible to combine the two, the important part to consider is that a CS degree teaches you computer science, not software engineering, and while there is varying degrees of overlap at different schools, if you spend your time doing a CS degree you spend a lot of your time 1) not programming or learning about software development skills, 2) not developing communications skills or more business oriented skills that are generally far more valuable most places that needs software developers than the additional skills CS <i>does</i> give.<p>Over the years I've had far more use for my (natural) language skills and communications skills than I have had for my CS degree. And I've had far more use for programming experience I've built up than either. I don't regret my CS degree, because I get a lot of pleasure out of using those skills on a hobby basis, but if I'd gone back and were to pick a degree specifically to be the best possible software engineer, there's just no way I'd have picked CS degree.<p>I've had situations where we genuinely had use for someone with a CS PhD, but for most development the CS skills are not that interesting and what you need are software engineering skill sets that most CS degrees simply don't teach. In the cases we've needed someone with in depth CS knowledge, we've in some cases found it easier to pair up someone with the CS knowledge with a good developer rather than trying to find the perfect combination.",1326885441

Why shouldn't they come after you? If you don't want it don't download. If you download it.. don't pretend you didn't want it.<p>""With the change left, you will pay lobbyists to ensure the governments make stupid and dangerous laws.""<p>The politicians pass the law's. I see nothing wrong with the music / film industry lobbying to protect their interest's. Where it gets scary is when politicians act on the side of lobbyists without considering the wider picture.<p>3) Because you are destroying the whole society<p>I agree there are problems but I completely disagree that these problems are all caused by the film and music industry. I didn't know EMI signed teachers for their lectures?<p>Finally...<p>""If I'm a pirate, it's not to have some cheap music. It is because the time has come for you to fuck off.

Now forced with the  need to run IndexTank myself, this benefit was lost.. Seeing as I'd have to run IndexTank myself<p>2) Even though it's open source, I doubt that LinkedIn, will be accepting any pull requests.. I imagine that this is nearly the end of the massive development drive that has previously gone on. (Purely my own thoughts, I hope I'm wrong)<p>3) The faceting with tokenizers is more powerful in Solr. (non existant in IndexTank)<p>4) The categorization implementation  in IndexTank was a little flawed. ie you couldn't create ""Grouped"" fields, that can contain multiple values. To do this, you had to invert the keys of the values, so that it maps like ""Sony=>manufactuer"" for example, where as in Solr, you can create manufacturer=>[Sony] and have multi value fields, such as theme=>[thriller,romance] etc.<p>5) Solr already has a Suggest more like these feature<p>6) The geo spatial stuff works better in Solr. Especially if you need facets on geo spatial documents to provide counts back.<p>7) 4.0 (available in trunk) has real time search. So no index rebuilding.<p>Don't misunderstand me in saying that IndexTank is poor.\nIndexTank worked great, and I reall liked it.

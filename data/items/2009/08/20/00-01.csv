Vanishing without explanation even seems the most appropriate ending for such a mysterious character.<p>What seems most comforting to me is that whoever created _why is in no way the kind of person to stop creating things - we might not know who he is or what he's working on, I think we can all rest assured the energy and talent that brought _why into being is not gone, simply put to other uses.",1250729481

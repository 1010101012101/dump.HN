They got 90% of the market and bought the trains so as to force their competition to pay 200% more in shipping. But by the time the government antitrust case started, Standard Oil's market share had naturally fallen to ~60%.<p>On the other hand, if you solve the problem with regulation, then the regulated body has a powerful tool for maintaining their monopoly: forcing their regulation onto their startup competitors.

2293730,comment,2292978,2293685,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> Why do you dismiss this as dogma and not practical for real world use?<p>I didn't, but the article <i>does</i> explicitly dismiss Agile ""silliness"", where one of the basic priorities is achieving working software.<p>> Our industry is plagued by bug ridden, crappy software.<p>Yes, it is. However, while I am as keen as the next guy to improve the quality of software, I also take the pragmatic view that you have to ship <i>something</i> before the quality is even relevant.<p>In particular, my personal experience has been that on real projects, there is a heavy price to pay for using anti-idiomatic techniques when it comes to maintenance time. Likewise, I have found that there is a heavy price to pay for using complicated APIs where simpler ones can do the job.<p>That means any benefits from techniques such as those advocated in the article must outweigh those costs before use of the techniques is justified. If a technique helps to prevent programmer errors that were otherwise likely, then that is a benefit to project quality that has some value. However, techniques that are theoretically neat but only remove classes of programmer error that were unlikely anyway are <i>not</i> inherently valuable, and once you're talking about real world projects with more open problem spaces, trying to check everything conceivable at compile time sounds a lot like one of those theoretically neat examples to me.<p>(As an aside, I aim similar criticism at various other trendy techniques in our field. I'm just as happy taking potshots at certain popular Agile techniques, such as prioritising unit testing everything even if it means compromising a sound modular design so the tests can have access to the internals of each module. Unit tests can be useful, but that corruption in the design comes with a price tag that has to be justified.)<p>> Please be a part of the solution, and not the problem.<p>It is interesting that when faced with a critic who does not accept theoretically sound/academically neat techniques as inherently superior to existing real world techniques, some people will assume that the critic is ignorant and/or lazy. Why is that?",1299397341

I paid for Pandora One for a few years, but pretty much stopped using it after a few months because its playlists would be incredibly incongruous. My Radiohead station became overrun with, for example, Katy Perry despite my efforts to ""thumbs down"" songs that didn't fit the Radiohead sound that I wanted.<p>Invariably, every time I've tried Pandora since, it plays one or two songs that match (the same ones every time, which gets really boring) before it meanders off into a forest constructed of oddities and WTF moments.<p>iTunes' Genius recommendations / playlists, though, have been incredibly good for me. Relatively obscure / nuanced selections generate amazingly well-balanced playlists with good variety without straying too far from the sound I want to listen to. For example, RJD2's ""Final Frontier"" is followed by:<p>* DJ Shadow - Keep Em Close\n* Blackalicious - Rhymes For The Deaf, Dumb, And Blind\n* Wax Tailor - I Don't Know<p>Pandora, on the other hand, comes up with:<p>* Diddy - We Gon' Make It\n* T.I - Doperman\n* Diverse - Wylin Out<p>I know Pandora's selecting from a huge library and iTunes Genius is selecting from my library, but my library is incredibly diverse and is in no way narrow enough to improve Genius' results. I get great playlists for everything from Coconut Records to Mayer Hawthorne to The Black Keys to Johnny Cash to the Heartless Bastards.<p>Maybe Pandora was good for it's time, but it simply hasn't improved enough over time.

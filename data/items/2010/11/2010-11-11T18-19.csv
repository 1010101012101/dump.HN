1894770,comment,1893824,1894717,0,0,glhaynes,,,"Apple's iAd system seeks to mitigate some of these things. The ad content is downloaded separately by the device so there's no network loading time, and hitting the home button takes you back to the exact same place in the app you had been in rather than back to the home screen like every other instance of hitting the home button (much to the consternation of some who highly value consistency). And, they only have ads that are highly interactive and ""interesting"", going so far as to do the production themselves on all of them to date, afaik. So at least if you see an ad for something you're interested in and it says ""iAd"" on the side, you'll know that by tapping on it you'll be getting something that's made for a small screen and probably has some decent content, not just a bigger version of the ad.<p>I certainly agree with you, though: I don't tend to click ads on my computer, I <i>certainly</i> am not going to tap them on my phone.

Another issue is that bitcode is not platform independent.  Things like pointer sizes and exception handling are dependent on the target you are compiling to.  Thus, they have to define a bunch of specifications for PNaCL programs so that they'll run everywhere.<p>It will definitely be interesting to see if anyone uses it.

I go out of my way not to read actual webpages on the 4"" screen, and thus I am certainly not going to try and conduct a learning exercise about your product nor am I going to suffer through typing my payment details to buy something.<p>Second, and I think I recall reading somewhere that an ad platform seeks to change this [maybe they all do!], but chances are that I'm currently <i>using</i> my mobile device for something. Unlike the magic Ctrl-click to open an ad in a new tab, if I were to have a sudden urge to click on an ad, that is going to interrupt whatever it is that I am trying to accomplish right now. Strong disincentive to do anything of the sort.<p>Finally, it has been overwhelmingly my experience that an app which uses an ad network is going to have lag and is going to incur pauses while I am trying to <i>do something</i> on my mobile. Maybe on wifi it's less of a big deal, but the times that I use my mobile on wifi are minimal, otherwise it would be a netbook.<p>I agree with in-app purchases as one of the money-making vehicles for the mobile market. I believe, also, in trial versions and outright purchasing apps based on good reviews. But seriously: can we please skip past trying to replicate the success of the ad networks from the web?",1289500523

As per your request for feedback (though I wouldn't say I'm smarter than you), some thoughts:<p>1) The link to your github repo is broken on your blog post.<p>2) In your manifest.json, you're setting permissions to ""tabs"", ""www.google.com"", ""<a href=""http://*/*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://*/*</a> and ""<a href=""https://*/*"" rel=""nofollow"">https://*/*</a>. If I'm not mistaken, the urls listed in the permissions field are for urls you'd like your extension to be able to call out to when doing AJAX requests, posts, etc. Enabling your app to make cross-site request to every domain, when you really only need google.com for the calendar, might throw up a red flag to more security-conscious users.<p>3) You're injecting a blank css document into every url the user visits. I would remove this unless you're planning on adding some styles into the css file.<p>4) The only other thing I see is more preference: You're doing a lot of work with the browser's dom api to create elements in your content script. Since you're already including jQuery in your extension, it would be trivial to inject the jQuery.js file into the page via your content script and use the power of jQuery to create your dom elements in far less code. Of course, there is nothing wrong with doing it in using raw JavaScript since it's targeted at a single browser and you don't need to worry about being cross browser compatible.<p>Thanks for posting, I'm always curious to see how other extensions are put together and might take away some ideas on interacting with google services.",1289499136

We have one of the previous generation Apple TV's with a very similar remote.  It currently sits unplugged next to the television on top of an upturned yogurt container.<p>It's on the yogurt container because its lack of vents causes it to overheat if sitting on a smooth surface.  It's unplugged because there's no clear power button on its very stylish remote.  I happen to know that if you hold down one of the keys long enough it will turn (mostly) off, but I don't think this knowledge is shared by others in the house.    It needs to be turned off because of the whine of the harddrive and the aforementioned overheating problem.<p>Using the remote to enter search terms for Youtube is possible, but is a dreaded chore.  Generally one says ""Here, let me show you something"" and then has to call the other party back from another room when done with the laborious process.  This is not attempted as much as when the device was new.  A keyboard as a remote may look silly, but would at least make simple things like this possible.<p>Overall, it's very cute and warm little boat anchor.  We'll probably eventually manage to get Boxee installed on it, but the lack of a reasonable means of entering text will really limit its utility.

Take the Yahoo! platform which is (very well) designed to be used while watching TV, yet the apps don't know what is being watched.  This adds some serious difficulty to app developers who want to enhance existing TV content which is kind of the current holy grail for TV apps (Actually most TV apps right now provide alternatives for delivering video content - and that <i>is</i> the killer app on TV right now.  I'm going to try to focus this screed on TV apps whose main purpose is <i>not</i> to deliver video).  This disconnect between app and video is currently being addressed. Early next year these apps will be able to be content aware and you will be able to have apps which are sync'd to the broadcast and this will add a lot of value to the chain. Unfortunately enhanced ads will likely be the first area where you'll see this functionality but someone needs to pay the bills.<p>The second trend is that a lot of TV interactivity will likely move from the TV to your tablet PC. We've already seen a first implementation of this with ABC's ""My Generation"" TV Show app (show's already canceled unfortunately).  This app sync'd to broadcast using audio fingerprinting.  I think that at some point these ""second screen"" apps will be the main type of TV Apps you see.  Likely using the TV app platforms for some simple updates. Think a leaderboard or something while playing - or a twitter feed.<p>With respect to social. I think where the most interesting social aspects for TV aren't ""Friend Feeds"" via  Twitter or Facebook.  But using social networks for content discovery. I think we're going to be so inundated with video content that our primary method for content discovery won't be a guide (or search) but some sort of social recommendation system.

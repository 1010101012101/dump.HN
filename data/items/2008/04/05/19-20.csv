155749,comment,155608,155741,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Price isn't proportional to efficiency. Making a solar panel that's 10% efficient instead of 20% efficient might require only 1/20th as much silicon. Also, the current limiting factor is the cost of manufacturing, not the cost of land. That's why companies are racing to build a new generation of low-efficiency low-cost photovoltaics.",1207424482

155742,comment,155688,155688,0,0,notauser,,,"Rough summary of the argument: When you need to make a decision, use the data you have available to make the one most consistent with achieving your goal. Also, the plural of anecdote is not data.<p>...however...<p>He misses the fact that it can be very hard to gather a sufficient sample of data for a complex set of variables. If you are designing a web site there are literally hundreds of choices to make. You can't reasonably expect to test all of your decisions before making them, or else you will be paralyzed by delay.<p>This leaves you with a second option of mocking up a couple of choices and see which ones are liked best, leaving you potentially with the best of a bad bunch.<p>Or, my preference, option three: Pick a couple of design champions who will tear any design to shreds and make you really justify your choices in terms of work flow and user interaction.<p>Generally you can assume that you <i>aren't</i> stupid, and you can figure out the right choices to make, however you won't always notice you need to do so unless you are being forced to justify your decisions by a grumpy critic.",1207423623
155741,comment,155608,155726,0,0,maximilian,,,"Of course efficiency is important.  10% is horrible by today's standards.  They are up to 20%, which would save you half of the panels cutting your costs in half.  The cost (or revenue) of an installation is directly connected to the efficiency of your solar-technology.  If you only have a fixed space to build it in, and your panels are twice as efficient, you make twice as much power and twice as much energy.",1207423536

Even if they do, once it shows up in the consumers bills, there will be hell to pay.<p>The best approach is to increase the efficiency through science and let the technology naturally be adopted like every other innovation that wins in the marketplace.  I'm still for the cap, but if that is the linchpin for adoption to take hold widespread, something must be wrong with the product.",1207423309

155735,comment,155442,155442,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"Using pg's criteria, the first one that comes to mind is Eugine Hutz (front man Gogol Bordello).<p>Like others pg mentioned, he writes the music for himself not for the audiences. The sincerity and lack of compromise really comes through - his music is an unconventional blend of gypsy and punk (go to a concert and for the first time ever you'll see a mosh pit in front of an accordionist), many of his songs have a lot of humour (something painfully lacking from most music), he sings half in Ukrainian etc and yet him and Gogol Bordello have achieved a fair amount of success.<p>I know it may sound a bit stupid since its 12 year olds would usually have music heroes, but I'm 24 and he's the only musician I'd ever call a hero.<p>It may be just me, but his music, lyrics and actions all all exude the same message: do what you love doing, be a decent human being, be sincere and you'll do alright. And that's an awesome message, regardless of what you choose to do in life.",1207422905

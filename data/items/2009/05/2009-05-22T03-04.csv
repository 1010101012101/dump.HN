I've also been impressed by the large number of micro-grants given to researchers for far out ideas.  That kind of charity takes a page out of the positive Black Swan theory -- if you play a lot of small bets in a field where some random finding has a huge impact, you're maximizing your upside.

More than that, he's building the Gary Vaynerchuk brand, which is admirable, but does me no good when I'm trying to show people who don't ""get"" the internet that you can actually help the sales of a brick-and-mortar business by becoming a big name on the web.<p>I like Gary, but he did dodge my question.<p>Rachael Osborn",1242963524

For example, OpenID still had a hole, even though it's been debated ad nauseum for years on mailing lists around the world by some of the top people in the field.   This isn't like building a bridge where you just follow some well understood design principles and the bridge doesn't fall down.   We probably just have to admit that this problem is <i>hard</i> (really hard) and there's no amount of rote learning, training or certification that prepares you for the inventiveness and creativity of the people who want to hack your system.  The best solution seems to be complete transparency, eternal vigilance, maximum communication and shared experience.<p>edit: I'm not saying training isn't important for anyone doing this stuff - just that making it mandatory probably won't change much over what we have now.",1242963207

Even using one sitting in a chair can be difficult unless you put a leg up and use it as a stand. A dual touchscreen device (folding at the middle) makes a lot more sense. The bottom screen could be used for control -- either a keyboard, or whatever interface device made the most sense for the particular app you were using.

However, what I absolutely hate is arrogant connoisseurs, whether or not they actually know their stuff.

It gets tiring after a while, but half hour is no problem. And usually you don't need to hold it for that long. For those who do, there are specialized and/or detachable ones that come in at less than 2kg; the HP TC1100 is <i>very</i> usable for this.<p>I have been a hybrid user for the last 3 years. I used to own an Intuos. There is no comparison, and I am not looking back. In some cases it brings probably a 10x increase in productivity. Why? Wrist movement vs finger movement, indirect visual feedback vs direct visual feedback. In fact, this efficiency has been critical for meeting the deadline for a research project I am on.<p>I am so tablet-happy that I will use Vista or whateverthecrap M$ sells me so long as it is the most tablet friendly OS (and it is). But I'm waiting for Apple to make one! The Modbook doens't cut it. Expensive as hell and no keyboard all for this ""this is what we think is best, eat it"" attitude (which, no offense intended, seems to be a very Appley attitude).<p>Anyhow, a 10"" Mac tablet isn't all that appealing to me because it will be quite useless for serious tablet work.

The taxi companies are going to advocate their interests -- mostly informally and without thinking of themselves as lobbying -- whether they&#x27;re in a $5 million market or a $50 million market.<p>All I meant is that there is some fixed cost to lobbying local government for favorable regulations regardless of community size, and it&#x27;s probably not worth it for local governments which are too small to have a sizable taxi market.<p>> Honestly, prior to Uber bringing all this into the spotlight, how much thought did you give to taxi regulations?<p>A fair amount, but that&#x27;s because I read a lot of libertarian stuff, and taxi regulations have been a major topic of libertarian economics as a textbook example of regulatory capture (perhaps second only to tariffs) for much longer than Uber has existed. The Machinery of Freedom, a popular libertarian book proposing a legal system without government, discusses taxi regulations at length, and it was first published in the 1970s. Libertarianism aside, I think taxis have always had a reputation in pop culture for being bad experiences, but I agree that the economic and political debates we see now involving ridesharing were never common.",1409126118

8231155,comment,8229327,8231015,4,0,zrm,,,"It isn&#x27;t about privileged ports. It&#x27;s about the protocols those ports are assigned to, and it&#x27;s really only referring to port 53 for DNS because it&#x27;s the only protocol that requires it. Using a shorter mapping timeout for port 22 or port 80 is not permitted.<p>The reason for DNS to be special is that DNS has to use a random source port for every query to reduce vulnerability to the Kaminsky attack. Most other UDP applications use a single socket (and thus port and thus NAT mapping) for all peers. So if you have many DNS clients behind a NAT you&#x27;re going to run out of source ports if you try to keep mappings for 120 seconds. Meanwhile the DNS protocol only requires the mapping to persist until the query response is received which is almost immediately.<p>So DNS gets a special rule. Which isn&#x27;t a 30 second timeout. There are real NATs in production that use 5 second mapping timeouts on port 53, which is completely reasonable and necessary if your site is making 10,000 DNS queries a second.<p>The sensible way to deal with all of this is to assume the 120 second timeout initially and if you encounter a hard disconnect that allows an immediate reconnection then reduce the keepalive interval. And don&#x27;t run non-DNS protocols on port 53 unless you&#x27;re prepared for the consequences.",1409125131

I thought about this when writing ZeroTier. On the plus side, this would work even on large segmented networks where UDP broadcasts donâ€™t make it everywhere. But the problem is that this exposes internal configuration details about the network to potentially random external peers. Many network security administrators are not going to like that, so I decided against it. I tried to think of a way to anonymize the data but couldnâ€™t, since the IPv4 private address space is so small that no form of hashing will adequately protect against exhaustive search.<p>I wonder if it would be possible to encrypt the local address with the internal MAC address of the router/gateway. Then only nodes seeing the same router could decode the information. I also wonder how Dropbox does this (it can tell when two connected computers are on the same LAN, and transfers files directly).",1409124770

They automatically detect when a captive portal is present by doing a background connection to some Apple-owned property and trying to download a small text file; if it fails for any reason, they bring up a modal panel showing the captive portal and letting the user login; then, they detect when the Internet access is active and close the panel (or, lately, let the user close the panel with a &quot;Finish&quot; button). What&#x27;s more important is that the whole operating system / applications are not given the signal &quot;network is on&quot; until the whole process is finished, so you don&#x27;t get one dozen of failures from applications that try to refresh in background and can&#x27;t access their backend servers.<p>This said, I really hate the fact that the WiFi alliance has left us in this very sad state.

8231124,comment,8229081,8230964,7,0,haberman,,,"I probably should also apologize for getting as snippy with you as you picked up on.<p>I&#x27;m a bit sensitive to these sorts of arguments, and not because I&#x27;m deaf to arguments about social justice -- actually the opposite.  Most of us on this website were born into incredible privilege that we did nothing to earn.  We grew up able to focus on our studies without being distracted by instability in our homes or violence in our communities.  We didn&#x27;t struggle to feed ourselves.  Some kids that grow up in poverty acquire mental habits and social patterns that they will never be able to shake completely that identify them as poor and limit their mobility no matter how hard they try (or anyone else tries to help).<p>This is heavy stuff that all of us who are privileged have to live with.  The world is deeply unfair and we&#x27;re the beneficiaries of it.  Nothing we can do can undo all the unfairness.  All the money in the world can&#x27;t buy a magic wand that will turn Africa into Europe.  The best we can do is try to be part of the solution and not part of the problem, as much as we reasonably can.<p>It&#x27;s because this injustice is so real that I get so cranky when the social justice card is, in my view, played without sufficient foundation.  A human&#x27;s most natural state is to value themselves and the people close to them more highly than everyone else.  When you make a social justice argument, the only people who will be impacted by it are the people who have accepted the idea that they have a moral obligation to care more about justice than their own personal well-being.  So you are, in essence, cashing in on the blank check they have written to the world promising to value the welfare of other people more highly than their own wants and needs.<p>This might sound a bit melodramatic for a discussion about a ride-sharing service.  But people who like Uber and Lyft <i>really like it</i>.  If you confront them and say &quot;your joy dance is deaf to the poor and sick that you&#x27;re trampling under the soles of your shoes,&quot; that is a very serious charge.<p>So if I see someone say that &quot;the entire point of taxi regulation&quot; is to protect the poor, handicapped, etc. and then I find that the first several articles I find concerning taxi regulation have nothing to do with this (and in fact, some authors argue the opposite, that reduced regulation would <i>benefit</i> the poor), I get a little cranky.  Because it, in my view, overstates the connection between this issue and the very real injustices of the world, and makes an unwarranted claim on the moral obligation of people who have decided to value justice above themselves.<p>> No matter what some people would have you believe, regulations aren&#x27;t just enacted to entrench power.<p>I would never argue that they are.  Few things in life are just one thing.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t argue that 100% of taxi regulations are automatically bad.  Some are probably worth keeping.  The handicapped-accessible issue is likely one of them.  (I don&#x27;t know much about the specifics of that regulation, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t seem to apply to 100% of taxis since I see plenty of Crown Victoria or Prius taxis that are just like what you&#x27;d get from UberX.)<p>But some regulations are clearly obsoleted by the innovations of Uber/Lyft.  And I am really opposed to a reactionary stance that says we have to protect the existing taxi industry against Uber/Lyft or the poor and sick will suffer (the implicit assumption being that taxis serve the poor and sick in a way that Uber/Lyft never can).",1409124306

I accept that, but assigning responsibility for a possible accident wasn&#x27;t really where I was coming from. It was more about increasing the odds of something tragic happening, for absolutely no justifiable reason.<p>To further elaborate on that point,  I meant that driving is a fairly risky activity that we engage in. A driver is accepting that risk in order to make a living. A client is obviously not responsible if an accident happens, as the driver has accepted the risk associated with the transaction, in exchange for money.<p>However, for every extra minute or mile on the road, a driver has a slightly higher chance of getting into an accident. Uber has made thousands of such calls, for absolutely no good reason and with no monetary benefit for the drivers. Although not directly responsible for possible accidents, the sheer number could have conceivably contributed to increasing the odds of one such accident/injury or even death (in a worse case scenario) happening. Which makes Uber&#x27;s actions even shittier in my books.<p>I understand that most people here don&#x27;t see it that way.<p>Note: Of course my assumption about the odds might be entirely false, if I misunderstood the way Uber works. For example if cars are just running around town until a fare is requested, instead of being parked somewhere.",1409123906

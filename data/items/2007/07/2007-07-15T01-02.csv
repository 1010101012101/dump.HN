34274,comment,34189,34189,0,0,willarson,,,"Jean, your site is pleasant, but it doesn't have anything to distinguish itself from established entities in the same field (Digg and Reddit among others). Your application needs to have something distinct and interesting about it. At this point is essentially a Digg clone down to even the small details like ""bury it"" and the box that shows the number of Diggs... eh... votes.<p>
Chalk this up as a loss. You probably learned a lot doing it, and thats what you should take away from it. Without a sizable user base you won't get funding for this website. You need to satisfy a need that isn't being satisfied, or satisfy an existing need better than it is currently being satisfied.<p>
If you blog is doing well by all means move your focus to that while you look for a more original idea to implement. I hope things go well for you, I can sympathize with your situation, as I too have learned that ""If you build it they will come"" isn't always quite true.",1184463837

Nothing about them, and certainly nothing about the quote used in the article, suggest that they are using note context to target audiences.<p>
This kind of article with haphazard speculation is no signal and all noise.",1184462343

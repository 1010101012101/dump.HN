At the end, they spend around the same amount than others, but they seem to prefer to go the gas station many times instead of just filling up the tank.</i><p>When gas prices are volatile this actually makes sense.  It's the same principle as ""dollar cost averaging"" when you buy stocks.  Purchase a fixed dollar amount, and you end up buying more when the price is low, and less when the price is high, which is what you want to do.  Therefore when I buy gas I stop at $25 unless I have a coupon or I'm somwhere that prices are significantly lower than where i normally buy (prices vary by $0.50--$0.75/gal within a 50 mile radius).",1368219595

5688632,comment,5688186,5688393,2,0,mnicole,,,"Ah, so the issue is fitting the screenshot into a laptop. There might be a few things at play here.<p>Are you using Layer Masks in Photoshop to accomplish this? If not, select the layer of the laptop in your Layers panel and click on the third icon from the left (a circle inside of a square) at the bottom of the panel. It will create a white box next to your layer preview thumbnail. It should automatically select the white box, but if not, go ahead and click on it. Then make a selection around the screen on the laptop and press delete. Place the screenshot of your site behind the laptop layer and adjust to fit within the dimensions of that selection.<p>For some reason in my version of Photoshop, it will show a bit of the original background behind the mask. To hide this/make it fully transparent, right click on the mask in your Layer panel and choose ""Refine Mask"". Then under ""Adjust Edge"", move the ""Shift Edge"" slider from ""0%"" all the way to the left to ""-100%"". Your View Mode should also be set to ""On Layers"" (which is hopefully the default, but just in case).<p>If the problem you're having is that on resize, the screenshot looks ""fuzzy"" or not as crisp, follow these directions - <a href=""http://www.missiondata.com/blog/design/372/sharpening-screenshots-in-photoshop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.missiondata.com/blog/design/372/sharpening-screen...</a> and tweak as necessary.<p>TL;DR, open/paste the screenshot as two new images, go to Image > Image Size and set the Resample Image (at the bottom) to Bicubic for one and Bicubic Sharper for the other. Put the Bicubic Sharper image layer over the fuzzier Bicubic one and fade the opacity out as necessary. You may need to apply the Sharpen filter to make it a little more crisp too.<p>Hope that helps!",1368219336

It's a instructive microcosm of how we got to having such bad advice about health, where a tiny little sample of the vast multidimensional space of health was taken because we happened to develop a test that could see cholesterol, and we radically, radically over-interpreted the results. (Arguably without even doing the test we could have done <i>right then</i>, which is to directly ask the question of whether eating cholestThen ask if you're really, really sure that's the only time that happened, in our set of health advice that largely was created in the same era (if not a decade or two before) and hasn't changed since. Because I do agree that consensus hasn't changed much over the past 50 years; what I am saying is that change is inevitably coming, and if you know where to look you can already see its shape.<p>""Salt is still harmful, btw.""<p>There are significant studies that suggest it's only harmful if you <i>already have</i> hypertension. There's also some serious question in my mind about how salt can be harming the population when studies can also show that people actually maintain a very constant level of salt intake and have historically maintained that same salt intake for as far back as we have records that can reasonably answer that question.<p>""Calm dieticians have been suggesting that people cut down fats, but not replace those with weird sugar-foods.""<p>And I still think this is revisionism. I've been reading recommendations from the government and other sources for my entire lifetime and I've only recently seen anyone making the point that replacing fat with sugar is a bad thing, and it is usually still people not in the scientific mainstream until <i>very</i> recently. (Sure, Atkins said it in the 1970s, but I'm sure you wouldn't count that.) The government has been pushing low-fat everything for a long time. If perhaps the point was being made in some academic journal somewhere, I don't really care, I'm talking about what the general population was told. The idea that low-fat itself might be bad can probably be dated to when it finally broke through that transfats (margarine) was worse than what it was replacing (butter), which was a relatively recent development (~10 years ago), and that's when it finally became politically viable to even <i>ask the question</i> of whether low-fat foods were actually better for you.<p>And I could quibble further (the badness of red meat is highly dubious from what I can see, fruit's virtues seem oversold), but it doesn't matter. The change is coming, because the advice we've been given for decades is unbelievably awful, ""our grandchildren will ask us how we could believe that"" awful. It won't stand, and when the authorities try to rewrite history to claim nothing has changed I will not forget that it's not what they told us.",1368218912

Of course this assumes that the person who has the name stolen knows it has happened and that the proper people are notified fairly quickly. There are many cases where people might not know a domain was stolen (extra domain pointing to another site for example or an unused name) so there is definitely a risk here.

I agree that having paywalls around content is bad and prevents the dissemination and access to fundamental knowledge.  We generate most of our operational revenue through journal subscriptions.  I know from working here that it does indeed cost a fair amount of money to provide both the IT and editorial support for peer review and archiving/presenting the data forever.<p>We are trying to get authors to embrace an open access model where they pay a fee of $1500 or so to make their paper Creative Commons licensed and free to read for all.  I do think there is a value for peer review and it is harder than commonly thought because science is so specialized these days.<p>An area which I think is woefully underserved is the science press.  In our journals, I can barely understand anything published as it requires specialist knowledge in small areas of study. Just reading papers does not really keep someone knowledgable about anything but their very specialized sub domain. Peer review in itself is nice but it is important to provide accessibility to what is going on in science via non specialist explanations of published works.<p>So I agree that the model of paywalling a bunch of PDFs is horribly broken, and should be disrupted.  I think scholarly publishing in general can really benefit from something like a one time fee to publish your paper and make it accessible to all not only in regards to paywalls, but in regards to the material being accessible to non specialists.",1368218099

You wake up in a cold-sweat thinking about the crisis of the day and trying to figure out how to make the impossible happen with no resources.

Now your low priority thread is running in preference to the high priority thread.<p>You can finesse some of that by interrupting on thread state change (which has its own issues since sometimes threads have to run to know they want to change their state) but you're still stuck somewhere between ticks when threads are sleeping and full tickless.

5688416,comment,5687488,5687488,14,0,n00b101,,,"I think they should have said more about the trust and quality control issues with journals (especially Elsevier, which has hundreds of obscure journals). I'm just a layperson ... but in my brief experience working with academic researchers during my undergrad days (specifically in the area of data mining / machine learning), I was surprised to learn that they did not trust research simply because it was published in a journal - they only trusted people who they knew, people they could speak with through informal channels to get honest opinions from. In data mining, the pattern of most papers is ""here is a new mash-up of algorithms A, B and C, with modifications X and Y, and here are some prediction accuracy benchmarks that   prove the supposed usefulness of our supposedly new method."" Needless to say, the actual code and test data sets are rarely ever shared. I recall coming across an outrageous number of data mining papers, appearing in Elsevier journals, which claimed to be able to predict  stock markets (!!!), written by people who did not have any real understanding of finance and I guess did not understand  how unlikely it really is to find predictive patterns in liquid, financial markets.<p>Another thing missing from this discussion is the style in which scientific papers are written. Invariably, published scientific papers are unhelpfully dense and terse, difficult to understand, full of needlessly obfuscated mathematical notation, and in general they are severely lacking in clarity. There is a stark contrast in the style of these formal papers and the style in which real research is actually shared and understood - through talks, presentations, teaching, textbooks, consultations, etc, where you have some hope of efficiently comprehending what the author is trying to present. I suspect that this obfuscation in papers is driven by the publishers and referees who impose a specific rigid style, combined with the researchers themselves who think that the less comprehensible their papers are to a wide audience, the  smarter and more credible they will appear to be on the surface.<p>Another problem is that one can often identify small groups of researchers who publish papers on the same topic and cite each others and their own papers, but nobody outside of their little bubble cites their research. I think that this phenomenon is due to a combination of the aforementioned lack of trust, lack of academic honestly, lack of transparency and deliberate lack of clarity.<p>One idea that I had is that the Internet could be used to create public networks of trust, so that researchers can identify other researchers as trusted authorities on specific topics. Academic communities have these implicit networks of trust already, but to an outsider it is very difficult to figure out who the leading innovators are on some obscure topic. A trust network, combined with citation data, could provide a graph that could serve as a useful tool for research as well as a kind of ""GitHub"" for researchers to increase their prestige and positions.<p>Another tool for escaping the publishing doldrums is standard benchmarks. In data mining and machine learning, for example, there are some standard data sets and performance measurements, so that anyone who claims to come up with a better statistical predictor can test their theory against the existing data sets and compare results against other approaches. There are also similar performance benchmarks for database query performance, in computer science. I think that there should be more of these.<p>The real difficulty with all of this is incentivization, as the article points out. I think it goes beyond the issue of for-profit publishing companies and funders. I suspect that there is a large contingent of researchers who are secretly ""hacks"" and they don't WANT the bright spotlight of transparency to shown onto them, because they would be exposed and would not be able to sustain academic careers and tenures built on publishing worthless papers in obscure journals for ""bubble communities."" One example of a bubble community is ""Fuzzy Logic,"" which has proven to be intellectually unsound and logically inconsistent, but which continues to fuel academic publishing careers, facilitated by companies like Elsevier who maintain obscure, wacky journals with a for-profit motive. I think the article is entirely appropriate in describing academic publishing as ""fraud-lite."" Personally, I was permanently turned off from the idea of an academic career after seeing ""how the sausage is made"" and seeing how worthless and suspect so many published papers are.",1368216589

I've done freelance work since 2001, and I use time to estimate my projects (very roughly) and even to invoice it (based on what I had estimated for them). Many clients are comfortable with that. On larger projects, I even paid other developers and had them submit their time to get paid. But I have never tracked my own time or outlined it for a client. In fact, with those other developers, I just wanted to know ""how much"" time they spent so I could pay them. The applications we worked on had the features implemented as requested. The client was happy with what was delivered to them.<p>While I did not track my time, I often found that I spent less time than I estimated. I say that because my freelance was on some evenings and weekends, and it simply didn't add up to a great amount of time. Once, I had a client over time, that often paid late, and we stopped working together when he had an outstanding bill. Much later, he contacted me with an urgent request. I got up front payment for twice what I estimated. Then I dug into the project and completed it in a tiny fraction of the time it took me to do it.<p>If you contractually agree to give clients ""dedicated time being truly productive towards creating the requested end result"", then I suppose you really need to be meticulous about tracking your time and providing records of how that time was used to move the project forward. I'd really rather not get in the habit of selling my time at all. I'm selling my ability to reach your objective, to build what you want to use. We'll define to the best of our ability what I'll be providing to you, we'll agree on the price, and then we'll measure our success on my delivery to you and your payment to me. What happens in between is of my concern, and it is in my best interest to spend my time effectively and perform efficiently.",1368216454

The novel is broken up into 3 periods, each 600 years apart, following a nuclear war that nearly wiped out humanity.<p>The first section, ""Fiat Homo"", revolves around an abbey in the desert, during a very harsh time in history, several  generations after the war.  There is almost no technology as man has been thrust back into the dark ages.  People are just struggling to survive.  The few books and relics of the past are copied by the monks with little to no understanding of what they contain with the hope that one day they may be useful in rebuilding society.<p>The second section, ""Fiat Lux"", revolves around the same abbey but now the world is in a period of a second renaissance.  Great thinkers akin to Galileo and Copernicus emerge and start rebuilding what we knew of science.  One man travels to the abbey who is considered to be one of the great thinkers of the age.  When he finds remnants of a physics book on optics in the abbey he is dismayed because he had wasted years of his life re-discovering the principals within the book himself.<p>The last section of the book, ""Fiat Voluntas Tua"", takes place when man now has nuclear weapons again and technology has advanced to beyond the point of the first near apocalypse event.",1368216328

I have an interest in linguistics.  But on the internet, some of the linguistics arguments are ridiculous.  There are websites that claim that English (and all world languages) are descendant from Turkish.  It is rubbish.  In all types of subjects you find people with these pet theories, and they can be very prolific, putting their opinion on wikipedia or wikia or wherever, on websites, in discussions, and there can even be a following.
In software, you can tell rubbish.  It compiles or it does not.  It has a lot of bug requests or it does not.  This does not map to science.  You can't run a scientific article through a compiler to tell if it is good or bad.  You can't tell if a new physics theory is reputable or some science fiction.  A theory may be 10 years old, and the professor who wrote it unable to respond to all the queries, ""bug requests,"" but it is still valuable.  And a prolific pseudo-science author may have little ""bug requests"" because no one reputable who knows something about the subject has any time to deal with his nonsense.
Without effective quality control, there will be no science.

Oh, and it might be an idea to have a boundary so people know where the law is valid, as well as a language in which the law is written, which means it's a good idea to educate people in that language.<p>Then what happens if someone doesn't initiate force against another, but just abandons them - eg a mother abandoning her child.

5688382,comment,5688222,5688222,14,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"> But the claim is disingenuous when used as an argument against DRM. Deprived of the ability to use browser plugins, protected content distributors are not, in general, switching to unprotected media. Instead, they're switching away from the Web entirely. Want to send DRM-protected video to an iPhone? ""There's an app for that."" Native applications on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and Windows 8, can all implement DRM, with some platforms, such as Android and Windows 8, even offering various APIs and features to assist this.<p>> In other words, the alternative to using DRM in browser plugins on the Web is not ""abandoning DRM;"" it's ""abandoning the Web.""<p>This shows a lack of understanding of what makes the web great. There's really no difference between a native app and a EME backed DRM layer. The web isn't about the browser window that it resides it; it's about content rendering the same on every platform. A page using EME is not going to render the same on every platform.<p>This is the status quo, with development costs being shifted from media companies (who no longer have to write separate apps for every platform they care about) to the platform owners who have to implement an approved DRM scheme or get their own scheme approved.",1368216203

You can't just download and install the newer version, the way you'd upgrade from OS X 10.6 to OX X 10.7. You have to go through a migration process.  And you want it to go seamlessly, including a temporary coexistence mode, so you really should hire specialized consultants.  For example, here's reference material on migrating from Exchange 2003 to 2010:
<a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd638130(v=exchg.141).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd638130(v=exchg....</a><p>MS Exchange is dated software, coming out with new versions regularly: 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013 (not yet production ready), and typically organizations keep whatever version they initially bought (say, 2003) rather than go through the pain of upgrading. So even if you were to migrate from Exchange 2003 to 2010 it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for consulting services in the process. And you're doing all that for software that was released in 2010, probably built in 2008-2010, so it's literally 5 years old software you're installing in 2013, that's only going to start getting more out of date.  That's one of the advantages of Google Apps and SaaS: once you go with Google Apps, you'll never have to upgrade, and you'll always have the most up-to-date version.",1368216202

Having a terminal where I can have the same experience whether logged into a *nix box, on osx, or sshed into a remote server is far more appealing than being able to cat images or having a pretty progress bar.  If I want to make json more readable I can just pipe it through one of the many json formatting scripts.<p>It might just be me but I find cocoa to be a bit boring and dated looking.  Unix terminals are timeless. A nice tiling windows manager with 5 terminals is still one of the most beautiful set ups.",1305719969

I agree with the commenter that -r-xr-xr-x - or even 0555 - is far better than ""you can't touch this"" (which doesn't describe who can't touch it, and in what ways). His ""rich display"" is actually a display of poverty - it conveys less information than text.<p>The typing of file / stream data is interesting, but I don't think it's realistic - it requires all tools to change virtually overnight to preserve the headers. And it's not enough just to preserve headers; what if you pump stuff out to a temporary file and read it in a few milliseconds later? What about compound files, with data chopped out of them? If you want pretty pictures, syntax highlighting etc., ISTM better to have an enriched terminal communication protocol along with a couple of viewer programs which can render data formats to it, rather than change the whole world to type every data flow everywhere.",1305719861

Good leather costs a fortune (you want the one without chemicals in them). Repairing these shoes is expensive too.

Always fight any request to impound any computer device. Its taking control of your property under somewhat shady if not illegal circumstances.<p>3. Have a business card with someone reachable 24-7 that will go to bat for you and claim that the device in question if company property and cannot be confiscated or impounded.<p>4.

2559757,comment,2559355,2559550,2,0,nextparadigms,,,"I don't think Intel will beat ARM in power consumption. ARM chips are just one processing node behind, so when Intel will be at 14 nm, ARM chips will be at 20nm.<p>Also Intel is still struggling to get just one Atom core to a low enough power consumption level. They can't improve the power consumption <i>and</i> performance in the same time. That means ARM chips will still be ahead for years in power consumption and performance (or performance/Watt).<p>From what I've noticed right now an Atom chip is like twice as expensive as a similar performance ARM chip. So it will be interesting to see if they will ever overcome that, too. Intel has never really liked making Atom chips because they make so much less money on them than on their other chips.That's why they haven't really improved them since 2008 when they launched Atom.<p>But they need to make SoC's, because ARM chips improve ~2.5x every 12 months, that's about 4x every 18 months, so twice as fast as x86 chips currently. That's why Intel is saying they want to start making SoC's and double Moore's Law. Because ARM is already doing that! But Intel won't have their 22nm 3D Atom until late 2013 or early 2014. The 32nm one won't be competitive. And I doubt the 22nm will be, too. It might be competitive in power consumption by then, but it won't be in performance, since ARM chips will keep the same low power consumption that they have now, but will increase performance 2.5x every year by then, while Intel can't do both in the same time.",1305717988

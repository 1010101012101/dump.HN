The fact that Page and Brin were both smart and made many good decisions early (well, decisions that later seemed to pay off from them, which is approximately equivalent, but not exactly the same) was a major contributor. But I find it hard to believe that the fact that one of them had a brother who sold a business for $432 million did not help them significantly as well. In two ways: yes the connections, but also the fact you could potentially go to a brother rather than a total stranger and get millions of dollars to invest. Unlike a lot of current Lean/Agile/Web2.0 startups, Google couldn't exactly just rent computing nodes from EC2 at the time, they had to buy or build them, which costs lots of cash upfront. ""Carl, remember that time I promised not to tell mom about who really broke her vase? I'm calling that in now.""<p>Yeah it does remind me of Bill Gates a lot too.

The key is understanding the initial construction of the DFA.<p>It's pretty general and clever in its simplicity.  It's really just trying all possible edits, recording the cost and progress until the costs exceed the budget or you've reached the goal.<p>To handle transposition, you need the state to remember the last character typed if it happens to match the next character, so the state space gets bigger.  In your example for hello, from the start state you'll introduce a state for starting with e.  This state encodes typed 'last char was e, matched nothing, cost 1'. From here, when you get an h, you move to the 'matched first two characters, used cost of one' state.",1300391947

I can't get any work done or stay focused on any problem because I don't feel any emotion toward what I'm doing. It's easy to say 'I don't care.'\nWhen that feeling hits, I dig deep into my music library for songs that bring out strong feelings other than depression or sorrow. The happy songs I can't get into, but the ones that have a little more pasion/rage (speaking of which, Rage Against The Machine would be a good one..) really get me going. It's easier to focus when I'm emotionally charged, so turn it up and get mad until you finish. Then you can relax and feel good about dominating the issue.  Probably doesn't work for everyone, but I wouldn't share if it didn't help me :)",1300391872

This fault line seems the greatest threat to the SF Bay Area. That said, whether San Andreas, Hayward or otherwise, any quake on a Bay Area fault line around an M8 or larger will wreak havoc on the Bay, especially along the Marina Green and other places with similar landfill. And I agree such an event is inevitable within the next few years. Fortunately, the seismic retrofits to the Golden Gate and the current rush to rebuild the Doyle Drive Freeway should mean those structures will withstand most anything, as will the tallest skyscrapers around the Bay.<p>(2) That said, I think the LA basin stands the greatest risk of failure during a quake: from what I understand, LA functions like a bowl of Jell-o, geographically: bounded by the ocean to the west and mountains to the north and east, earthquake waves tend to reverberate within the ""bowl"" and generate far more damage than they would elsewhere due to the formation of standing waves.<p>(3) Either way, I think those of us living in earthquake-prone areas need to realize that it is all but a mathematical certainty that we will be struck by another devastating quake within our lifetimes. Accordingly, I think it is foolish to not take at least elementary precautions: I for one, even I could afford it, will simply never live in the Marina Green due to the risk of liquefaction. Similarly, I would far rather live in a tall skyscraper condo rather than a small home since (a) they are designed to withstand quakes far better than smaller structures and (b) it turns out they function like wind instruments (i.e., closed on one end, open on the other): when high frequency earthquake waves strike a tall building, they resonate at a much lower frequency than in a smaller building. These two factors alone -- along with stricter building codes -- explain why we've <i>never</i>(?) seen a modern skyscraper fail in an earthquake.",1300390609

In reality, the world is not as dangerous as an Internet debate can make it sound. Type out the full description of what's involved in walking down the stairs and you'll make an emotionally-appealing for banning them (""my god, any one muscle fails to work and you can fall to your death!""), but it has no correspondence to reality. In my judgment, I am not even remotely endangering my kids in the real world. You are welcome to your opinions, but in my opinion turning my judgment over to others is itself not a good judgment.</i><p>Stairs are fairly dangerous for some people.  Our neighbors child has fallen down their stairs three times, and only on the last one did he even need a trip to the hospital.  He'll be fine.  And probably between the age of three to 85 he's not in any serious danger of falling again.  But that's an aside.<p>The real point is that many of the recommendations may not apply to you.  That's fine, don't follow them (especially when it comes to your child... that's one place where you have extreme flexibility).  But they are meant to apply to a large population, and I don't think IQ is the best metric to apply to determine if you're in that population.<p>Regarding cough syrups, I suspect you are familiar with the various studies, but I'll pass this along for those that aren't:  <a href=""http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/content/full/55/11/1081"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/content/full/55/11/1081</a><p>From the article:<p>""The US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance program reported that OTC CCM preparations were responsible for 7091 visits to emergency departments (EDs) during 2004 and 2005 in children younger than 12 years old. This represented almost 6% of total ED visits related to medication. Of these cases, 66% were due to unsupervised ingestion. A quarter of cases were due to properly administered medications with undesired outcomes. Eight times more children presented with effects of medication errors related to OTC CCMs compared with other medications. While children aged 2 to 5 years represented the largest group in this study, children younger than age 2 had the highest rate of adverse reactions.8 Providing further evidence of the ED burden related to OTC CCMs, the Centers for Disease Control reported that 1519 patients younger than the age of 2 were treated in American EDs in 2005 for problems related to OTC CCMs.<p>The true prevalence of OTC CCMs in pediatric illness might be underreported. Physicians might not consider the role of such medications in various presentations, such as apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs). Pitetti et al reported 13 out of 274 (5%) patients presenting with ALTEs had evidence of OTC CCM use on toxicology testing.10 This raised concern about the potential role of OTC CCMs in ALTEs and led the authors to conclude that toxicology screening should be performed in all cases of ALTEs. ""<p><i>In fact I'm rather strongly of the opinion that there are numerous real-world examples in the field of medicine and nutrition in which science has ""studied"" itself into wildly wrong beliefs that nobody would have taken seriously but for the failures in the scientific process and the misapplication of its authority, and as much as I love science and wish I didn't have to do this, I've really deprioritized science in this area.</i><p>Science doesn't have the truth.  It has the best theory for the data at the time.

I generally hate any environment where one pays hundreds or thousands of dollars in order to wait in lines. This is not a failing of SXSW or the people who attend; SXSW has been a great marketing success for its founders. It's just something I don't like, so I make sure I'm not in town when some of the venues I frequent will be packed and prices hiked up for the duration.<p>It brings swarms of people pushing products and ""personal brands"" into a town where that sort of thing is not common, even at tech events. People start companies in Austin, but the culture is a different one from Silicon Valley, and I like it that way. But, I like Silicon Valley the way it is, too; it is true to its history and part of its charm. The problem is when you try to shove a square peg into the funny looking blob shape that is Austin culture. I spent three years in Silicon Valley, and I enjoyed most of it. When I first arrived and started attending nerd events, I thought, ""I've found my people!"" Turned out not to be so much true after a bit more reflection and exposure, and the 38th time I heard someone pitching a revolutionary new travel wiki, or the countless times when someone explained their new product in relation to some other new product I'd never heard of (""So, it's basically a clone of X, but we've added social features!"" where X was some company that had existed for two months and had one developer and at least a dozen users and had been mentioned in a comment on TechCrunch by its founder). But, it's a valuable part of American culture and I love that Silicon Valley exists, so I can visit when I want to experience that culture. I love the history of computing and a lot of it happened because of and inside of the valley. Nothing wrong with Silicon Valley, but for me, I have to take it in measured doses.<p>So, that's the part of the valley that I don't like coming to Austin. I also mentioned LA and New York, and those cultures also infect the entire conference and not just SXSWi.<p>The thing about LA is that the Next Big Thing is the holy grail...and everyone playing SXSW is trying to convince you they're the Next Big Thing. There are promoters <i>everywhere</i>, people pushing CDs, flogging their particular showcase with flyers and parties, and a huge pile of people telling you what to like. While Austin has more live music per capita than any other place on earth, Austin doesn't normally do the Next Big Thing. Bands sometimes make cool posters, and that's about the extent of their marketing prowess. During SXSW there are hundreds of bands playing every day in Austin, sure, but on <i>any</i> day in Austin there are hundreds of bands playing (6th Street alone has several dozen live music venues, most open 7 days a week, and with two to four bands on the bill). SXSW just means you have to wait in line and pay hundreds of bucks to see them, and fight a trade show crowd gone wild to get a seat or a place near the stage. Which brings us to New York culture...that of exclusion and long lines and stupidly expensive drinks. You don't just get into every show at SXSW, even with the fanciest of wrist bands. You have to wait in line, or know the right people. This, again, is a testament to the success of SXSW. It is a huge event, and the crowds are tremendous. That doesn't mean I have to like it. I've been a live music fan (and a musician) since I was a kid, but I decided very early on that once the crowd reaches a certain size, the experience is remarkably less satisfying. While most of the clubs in the SXSW rotation are small enough and cool enough venues for transcendent live music experiences, the crowd, both in size and in kind, are not.<p>So, enjoy SXSW. If that's the sort of thing you like, then SXSW is about as much the sort of thing you'd like as anything I can think of. I do not enjoy it, so I'll park in some other city while it's happening. I'm in Flagstaff, AZ this week, and I'll probably spend a couple days at the Grand Canyon, and then maybe pause in Albuquerque, before heading to Austin for another month, or so. Austin should be getting back to normal by the time I arrive.",1300389111

Many a time only one of us is at home for lunch and sometimes even for dinner.<p>Even when we cook larger quantities the 'traditional way' we end up heating them again the next day. Besides it's just outrageous to boil half a teapot for a singe tea cup when just filling the cup and popping it into the microwave.<p>When cooking vegetables with steam in the microwave we use a (provided) accessory with which you lay vegetables on a grid, fill the bottom with one glass of water, cover with a metallic lid and throw in a few minutes of power. A pressure cooker requires more water, a longer heat up time and a longer cooking time. It is also extremely bulky. We have one but never use it.",1300388717

2337521,comment,2336991,2337264,0,0,jerf,,,"""And honestly, having a high IQ isn't sufficient for attention to detail, like stirring food.""<p>Part of the problem here is that if you type it all out it sounds horrible. In reality, the world is not as dangerous as an Internet debate can make it sound. Type out the full description of what's involved in walking down the stairs and you'll make an emotionally-appealing for banning them (""my god, any one muscle fails to work and you can fall to your death!""), but it has no correspondence to reality. In my judgment, I am not even remotely endangering my kids in the real world. You are welcome to your opinions, but in my opinion turning my judgment over to others is itself not a good judgment.<p>""There have also been studies that show that cough medicine may simple have the placebo effect.""<p>Right. Kid goes from a hacking cough that kept him awake for three nights straight to fast asleep (and resumed coughing the next day & night, so ""he just got better at the same time"" isn't on the table either) and it was all placebo, for a kid who can't even talk yet. Sure.<p>Honey's an interesting thought which I may consider, except that there's no evidence that cough syrup is a problem, except vague nervousness because there haven't been any ""scientific studies"" on the topic. However I consider the abundant real-world experience that preceded the hand-wringing about it not being ""properly"" studied to trump it; on the scale of evidence scientific studies are <i>not</i> the highest good, the real world trumps it (which is actually a core tenant of any decent theory of science, any theory of science missing that isn't worth anything), and it was extremely widely deployed for a long time before some people got nannyish about it. If it were noticably bad, we wouldn't have to theorize, we'd <i>know</i>. (At best it can have a small below-the-noise-floor effect; widespread experience can't prove 0 bad effect but it can and does put a rather low upper bound on it.)<p>(In fact I'm rather strongly of the opinion that there are numerous real-world examples in the field of medicine and nutrition in which science has ""studied"" itself into wildly wrong beliefs that nobody would have taken seriously but for the failures in the scientific process and the misapplication of its authority, and as much as I love science and wish I didn't have to do this, I've really deprioritized science in this area.)",1300388665

In this case, there are definitely HN readers who can understand the code ESR is talking about, and pretty quickly figure out if there are flaws in ESR's reasoning regarding the code in question.<p>Once we have the actual flaws in his reasoning, his tea-baggery or whatever become completely irrelevant, because we have much more solid reasons for rejecting his conclusions.  If this were a different forum, with no participants well versed in technology, mathematics, and the scientific method, maybe you need to consider the motivation of the arguer when considering the validity of the argument.

It's very common for humans to have a strong enough emotional investment and attachment to the fruits of their labor that they act irrationally in manners involving that creation. Seeing GMail get abandoned by users would be psychologically very similar to (though probably far less severe than) the pain of seeing your child spurned by his peers.",1259462972

I find the user interface a bit counter-intuitive and cluttered too.<p>Whatever Paul feels about Wave, he actually makes a couple of clever suggestions Wave's team, I think, should listen to: make it (optionally?) linear and also build the wave-to-email gate. These two things are more important for Wave at the moment than anything else.<p>If Paul built Wave it'd probably be in a more usable state now, wouldn't it?",1259462968

Far too many applications ship several versions without ever getting rid of the features that should never have been there in the first place.

Google Wave is great for collaboration and group work and game playing.  However, when it comes to replacing email it is too bloated I think.  Of course they will probably speed it up and simplify as it develops.<p>Also there will always be a market for a simple email client, if only for the simple reason that not everyone wants the entire world to see that they can't type very well.<p>It is more professional to send a completed email then to have the recipient see you typing in realtime complete with misspellings, clumsy typing, and grammar errors.<p>That is the main impression that I have with Google Wave.

The piece I read criticized this practice as being a new fangled way to keep the upper class in power because the people who can afford to take a full-time job which pays nothing at all are generally going to come from a rather privileged family background. It was cited as a sneakily exclusionary practice, a la Jim Crow laws.",1259461825

They will say those words and make a promise.<p>I have no doubt many of them will just go on and rape and pillage whatever they find in front of them, but others will take it seriously, will keep their promise, remembering what they said and why they did it and, in the end, the world will be a better place for that.<p>It's also a statement that some of the ways of the past will no longer be tolerated. It sets a code of conduct.<p>Like I said elsewhere, there are very few rites of passage left in our society. It's pretty obvious there are far too many executives running companies like kindergarten dictators, overgrown babies that want everything the way they like no matter what. Maybe something that helps them realize they changed because of all the work they did in the MBA course helps.<p>It's a big maybe, but it's also clear it's a step in the right direction.",1259461742

Didn't someone further up in the thread give an example?<p>Edit: reading again what you wrote I am not sure: is the law in iceland that each parent can take up to 4.5 months leave, or is it 9 months they can divide freely (ie 9 months mother, 0 months father or vice versa would be possible?). I thought they can only take at most 4.5 months each.<p>I only just know read the article you linked, and it didn't actually give numbers for the proportions of men and women taking the leave. So the claim in the article is worthless (it sounds like just some politician justifying their policies).<p>I have read before that things in iceland are quite different, though. I think it is much more common that the whole family (grandparents) takes care of children and divorced women, so maybe there is less pressure on them.",1259461479

I am sorry that I even spend so much time discussing this, but I am horrified at how fast many people seem to be jumping the gun here.<p>I see some emails that give a strange impression. How about investigating more details before calling it fraud? ESR can not even point to an actual application of the alleged corrections. I think for fraud we would need a little more.<p>Note I don't say it wasn't - I don't know anything about the people involved, their standing or their research.

If you want to see examples, go over to Smashing Magazine and take a look through a few of their lists of 'well-designed' pages. The vast majority of the things they feature are not particularly well-designed. What all of them are is visually attractive. Those are the kind of people I think Andy's talking about.",1259460999

It's also a powerful commitment - you state the rules that will bind your professional (and many times, personal) conduct for life. That's a big thing - a rite of passage (something important we have precious little left). It turned engineering students into professional engineers.<p>It's insane to reject every pledge out of principle. A pledge, specially one like that, sets a good example - a model of conduct. If you are not happy with it (like the author), propose an alternative one, one you would be comfortable taking.The worst that can happen is to make an empty promise, one you know you won't keep. It's deeply demoralizing and we have had lots of that in upper management lately.<p>And, finally, sorry if you feel attacked, but nobody is obliged to trust you to even know what's ""the right thing"", much less to do it or to agree with the rest of the society on what ""good"" means. That's what pledges are for.",1259460965

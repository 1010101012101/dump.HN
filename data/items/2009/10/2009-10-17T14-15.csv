886981,comment,886904,886962,0,0,Mz,,,"Passive solar design has been around a long time.  I believe it was more popular in the past, when people were generally more in tune with the weather and the world around them. I think ""modern"" life has tended to make a lot of people somewhat oblivious to that.  One reason it would need to be new construction is because orientation to the sun is part of the design which can't be fundamentally changed once it's built.  However, there are passive solar things that can be added after the fact to improve on efficiency (granted it likely won't match the efficiencies you can get in new design).  One example:  Planting deciduous trees such that they shade the house from the worst of the sun in summer.  In winter, their leaves fall off and you get free heating with passive solar.<p>Interestingly, a discussion I saw elsewhere about ""cooling towers"" noted the two following tidbits:  1) Victorian housing in America had design elements like this which most people in the discussion had previously assumed was merely whimsical/decorative and 2) Middle Eastern countries, like Iran, have long used such designs as a fairly common element in housing.",1255791008

886965,comment,886847,886946,0,0,viraptor,,,"I'm not sure this answer is what you're looking for, but:<p>The function does the same thing as the Pairwise in the article. What haskell does is ""guess"" at what the types of each variable / function can be, which is fairly easy in this case. For example pairwise expects a list in the first argument (because it's split into ""a"",""b"" and the rest of items), and some other argument ""f"". ""f"" is called with ""a"" and ""b"" as arguments (which are of the same type, because they come from the same list) and returns some result. The return value of ""pairwise"" is constructed from either results of ""f"" or an empty list, so the result must be a list of the items that ""f"" returns. etc.<p>So the compiler itself can figure out all the types needed in that function without any help from the user. (basically we could do it in the C# case too, even if someone removed all the types) Haskell will happily compile that function with the signature it found out and will let you run ""pairwise [1,2,3,4] (\x y -> x-y)"". But it will not even <i>compile</i> your program if you try to use a number as the first parameter or a function with different signature in the second. It's just a function with generic arguments and some limits on what you can use (""f"" has to take both arguments of the same type - you can't use ""Char -> Int -> a"" there).<p>You're still allowed to run ""pairwise ""abc"" (\x y -> x:[y])"" and will get ""ab"" ""bc"" - however there's no dynamic duck typing involved.<p>So my point was that there's nothing bad about the static typing itself. In most cases you don't need to write all the types yourself - they can be easily guessed and it's much better if the compiler does it for you.",1255790323

The right comparison is between TDMA and CDMA or between GSM and CDMA 2000. From a technology viewpoint, most people would agree that CDMA has clear advantages, which is why GSM's 3G variant is based on CDMA. From a standard's point of view, GSM wins because it has things like SIM cards and widespread availability leading to economies of scale. When it comes down tp picking a particular operator and price plan, that has more to do with local regulation and carrier marketing than the technology or the standard. Near me Verizon has the best network because they put up the most base stations. T-Mobile is the cheapest because they have to compete with the others harder as they are the smallest.",1255789083

If you are suicidal the minute you get bad news about your business, some growing up is in order and some psychological space so you don't take it so personally might also be appropriate. Yes, feeling ""alive"" and letting yourself go on a roller-coaster of emotions can be a Good Thing. But having poor boundaries and no perspective usually isn't. The fact that what you think is going on at first blush is very often wrong has been addressed by countless forms of literature, not just ""Romeo and Juliette"" (where, if I recall correctly, one commits suicide because they THINK the other one has, only the first one was faking it). And in business it's often critical to wait and see what is really going on and get the facts before you go making irrevocable rash decisions based on your first impression of something.<p>I'm one of the ""five or six"" women here and probably don't fit in, socially, in some ways.

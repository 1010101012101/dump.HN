4868455,comment,4867578,4868330,4,0,darklajid,,,"That's a very interesting and good thought.<p>Maybe my whole point of view is skewed: I'm reasonably safe in my job even without a savings account (got none. Is that a bad idea? Yeah, probably. But that's a different point).<p>That said, Germany isn't alone in the rules I'd take as granted. What I rely on here is just a decent time between being let go and being without salary. I don't claim to have a lot of experience here, but I know that this exists in various other EU countries and was told that this is common in IL as well, for example.<p>If you want to fire me, you still need to pay me for a ~reasonable~ amount of time (and I need to work, of course). I'll try to find another job during that time.<p>Startups seem to have a tendency to go down in flames (what law could order a company that has no money to pay salaries?) or are exempt of a lot of laws that make me feel safe (as I said, here in Germany the law makes it far easier to drop people while you're below a certain, single digit(?) head count).<p>I'm ignoring your 'build up savings' suggestions. It's a good one. I agree. And if I'll ever manage to do that, I'll either keep it for my family or .. for my own startup (if that might be realistic). It still wouldn't be a cushion to join a startup myself. The point of the OP of this thread seemed to be that you have to find a ratio between decent pay and nice equity. I understand. I agree.<p>I just think that this totally ignores the cost of searching for another job in this silly ""I pay you X. That means that you make X * 12 / year. Let's compare that to the shares now, with various outcomes in the list"" kind of posts.<p>That's ignoring a big issue for the guy signing the contract. Saying 'Yeah, if it goes down you lost $marketValue - $startupSalary' is just .. well .. stupid. Unless you _know_ that there's an instant job opportunity for the guy at the end. No? Nothing nearby / close to family? Nothing that allows enough free time or fits the _basic_ interests of the guy that was let go?<p>Ah well, that's what a savings account is for, right?<p>Disclaimer: No personal grudges here, I just don't think that these discussions are .. sensible. In general. Most of the time these arguments are lead from the mind of a 23 year old single with a lot of self esteem and confidence.<p>I handed my membership card in, a couple of years ago. It's nice on this side of the fence, but the perspective really changes a lot.",1354575428

Our CFO in conjunction with our general counsel determines the effective valuation which is ratified at the appropriate board meeting and becomes the official strike price until the next valuation 'event'.<p>There are two numbers in play, one is the value of common stock and one is the value of preferred stock. Preferred stock is used in conjunction with raising capital and often has terms and covenants attached to it which make it significantly more valuable than common stock early in the company's life cycle where they effectively converge on the same value at the IPO (or 'liquidity event')<p>That said, the example is illustrative but not strictly accurate (accurate in principle but not in execution). What <i>really</i> happens is that you run out of money faster with a higher salary load, and that means you may need to raise additional funds sooner. That fund raising round would proceed like any other round, caveat your 'target' now includes an additional $200K to cover the salary you're paying out. Worse that stock you sell will be preferred and not common stock, and as such might have preferences like 2x return which would further reduce the benefit to common stock holders in the event of a sale or merger.<p>Its truly a good prisoner's dilemma game setup. If all of the employees take large common stock grants and low salaries they all benefit more on a non-IPO type event, if a few take big salaries they can make the threshold for everyone else benefiting higher, thus by not co-operating get a better salary and reduce total compensation of their peers.",1354574959

Each bid the final price goes up x amount of cents. At the end of the auction the winner pays the final price, if you didn't win the auction it costs you nothing since you never bought bids. Like this free auction <a href=""http://www.dreamybids.com/contest.php?id=332"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamybids.com/contest.php?id=332</a><p>3. You can host your own auctions. So even if you did lose $50 in bids, put up an item of your own and make your money back. If we collect 30% more than the retail price of the item, you'd get 50% of the overage, so you can make way more than you would from selling an item on ebay or craigslist.<p>4. There are some great gamification tools that allow you to freeze the bid of the next bidder, or buy the timer down, or block a power bidder from joining an auction. Also once the auction starts new participants can't jump in.<p>Asking questions keeps you from being theamazingidiot",1354574735

In legal parlance, the term <i>voir dire</i> refers to the questions posed to prospective jurors by the judge or lawyers to assess whether any of them is biased or has some other disqualification or disability.<p>2.  The term <i>voir dire</i> is French:  After the Norman Conquest, that term and a number of others gradually infiltrated the language of English courts [1].<p>3.  In French, <i>voir</i> is the infinitive <i>to see</i> and <i>dire</i> is the infinitive <i>to say</i>; as someone who was bilingual in French and English as a kid (but, sadly, is no longer), I always took the term <i>voir dire</i> to mean, roughly, ""let's see what they [the prospective jurors] have to say.""<p>Fun fact:  In Texas, you'd better pronounce it ""VORE dye-er"" if you don't want to be recognized as a noob or an out-of-towner.  The rest of the country seems to use the French pronunciation ""vwahr deer.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article756.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article756.pdf</a>",1354574660

Hell, Apple is doing the ""thin/small and light"" thing even with their ""desktop"" machines like the iMac and Mac Mini.<p>Mac and PC users just have different set of priorities. I used to own macs but I fully went back to the PC because being able to handle repairs myself in a timely manner is much more important than the niceties of OS X for me, particularly with desktop machines. The mac mini is not good enough for me, and the iMac is exactly what I don't want, if anything fails in the computer I want to be able to replace the part in five minutes and be done with it. That and the fact that the screen tends to outlive my computers in usefulness, I replace them less often than the parts of my desktop PC so buying a computer attached to the screen feels offensive to me.<p>The Mac Pro could've been an alternative but.. 2600 euros for a computer that is outdated in every single way out of the box is not attractive. Its GPU used to be a mid-range gamer card, used to, because it's not even mid-range in 2012, it's low end. If you build your own computer a GPU with that kind of performance will cost about ~100 to 150 euros, which is not acceptable for a 2600 eur computer. The rest (cpu, ram) is decent but still doesn't really warrant the price tag. It was good when it first launched.. that's about it.",1354574510

Had he been abided by it, he could have made no contribution (Shock! He 'stole' the idea!).  He improved on Swans design, but at the same time Swan also improved on his design.  When Edison had his breakthrough, Swan had already installed electric lighting in a number of houses and when the two finally collaborated, the joint company used Swans newer design which was the better of the two. Wikipedia has this to say:<p>""In America, Edison had been working on copies of the original light bulb patented by Swan, trying to make them more efficient. Though Swan had beaten him to this goal, Edison obtained patents in America for a fairly direct copy of the Swan light, and started an advertising campaign that claimed that he was the real inventor. Swan, who was less interested in making money from the invention, agreed that Edison could sell the lights in America while he retained the rights in Britain."" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Swan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Swan</a>",1354572432

Of all the jobs/areas, sales is the easiest to hire without a large cash outlay. If you had said, ""We likely need VC money because we need to rewrite a huge chunk of the code"", I would've bought that but to say you need that money to build a sales team doesn't make sense to me.<p>For example, let's say I have a $1m/yr enterprise software company and we have no sales staff. If I want to go hire a sales person, what is it they want out of the deal? They want a product that meets marketplace needs, is well supported, is easy to demo, has a track record, and then I want to get paid as much as possible for each sale. You've proven that you have a saleable product and a track record, it seems. The next important part is the last part: ""for each sale"". You pay them commission - maybe not 100% commission at the start but, by month six, they are likely no less than 50% commission. It's far from a no-risk strategy but it's far cheaper than hiring engineers and having to pay 100% salaries w/ no add-on to sales. You could hire a sales manager and three sales people who, after six months, are on 50% commission. Within a year, they're on 100% commission plus bonuses.<p>With all that being said, yes, I'm making it seem simpler than it is. But, at this stage (and without knowing more about your business), it seems like the above hasn't been considered. A good sales person will drive your marketing for you, at least initially. He/she will say, ""I need x and I need y to sell this product."" You can then contract out x and y. The big cash outlays are going to be buying lists for the sales people and sending them to conferences.<p>Lastly, I would say that, if you find it tough to hire/find salespeople willing to work on commission, that either (a) your product price isn't being seen as profitable from a commission salesperson's POV, or (b) they believe either your support or product/market fit are just not good enough for them to make a high commission.<p>Sorry - I just don't see that as a big deal for a company selling enterprise software.",1354572059

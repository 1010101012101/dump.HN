I now enjoy deciding whether to make an essay inductive or deductive, and playing with the order in which I introduce things to create weird effects (used a lot by one of my favorites Douglas Adams).",1216018438

I am developing a web mashup and looking for text-to-speech conversion. The content of the site changes, so I can't depend on a virtual character with pre-set text. And the app I am developing is going to be hosted on Google appengine, so if there's any server-side stuff involved, then it needs to be python.",1216018341

Their only problem is ""venting with flame"" if you don't charge/discharge them within their limits, but electronic control can mostly eliminate that.<p>Now we just need a battery company to start making car-battery-sized Li-Ion's and sell them for a reasonable price. When that happens, I think you'll see some serious action.",1216017572

They're also heavy because they're loaded with features. It's very unlikely that you can find a nice light minimalist car that you can successfully convert, but if you know of any, I'd love to hear about them.",1216017346

You know, the whole ""because fuck it, that's why"" mentality.<p>Additionally, Tokyo, as a populace, is much more collective and like-minded. A hive-mind, to be more blunt and offensive. Individual actions are taken in context of the whole rather than analyzed by itself. Thus, there is just about only bowing as a greeting there; whereas in the US, there's your choice of fist-bumps, high-fives, daps, pounds, pound-hugs, skins, or variations thereof. It's even distinctive by region or even state and city, or RACE.<p>So, because fuck it, that's why.",1216016454

This is often in direct opposition to obsessing over quality: you have to accept that your app, which is a piece of shit, needs to get out there, so you can get feedback, before you make it a gleaming cube of perfection.<p>2) Random chance is going to factor in your startups success far more than you&#x27;d like, so building a startup that will not die no matter what  (rev/run > 1) is going to give you a better shot at making it over the hump.  This often means putting up with uncertainty and not knowing exactly what you should be or will be doing.  And it will be hard on you, mentally.",1389823190

They&#x27;re not mean people. They&#x27;re not assholes, but they&#x27;re serious about their responsibilities.

Even in this article he claims SD doesn&#x27;t model real world as well as MAD and then as arguments ask you what would you do if you were asked to calculate... MAD, you would clearly see it&#x27;s not SD :-)  \nHis latest book is worse than the article and my conclusion about him being and idiot is based mainly on it.\nHere is one gem from his book:<p>>>True, while humans self-repair, they eventually wear out (hopefully leaving their\ngenes, books, or some other information behind—another discussion). But the\nphenomenon of aging is misunderstood, largely fraught with mental biases and logical\nflaws. We observe old people and see them age, so we associate aging with their loss\nof muscle mass, bone weakness, loss of mental function, taste for Frank Sinatra music,\nand similar degenerative effects. But these failures to self-repair come largely from\nmaladjustment—either too few stressors or too little time for recovery between them—\nand maladjustment for this author is the mismatch between one’s design and the\nstructure of the randomness of the environment (what I call more technically its\n“distributional or statistical properties”). What we observe in “aging” is a combination\nof maladjustment and senescence, and it appears that the two are separable—\nsenescence might not be avoidable, and should not be avoided (it would contradict the\nlogic of life, as we will see in the next chapter); maladjustment is avoidable. Much of\naging comes from a misunderstanding of the effect of comfort—a disease of\ncivilization: make life longer and longer, while people are more and more sick. In a\nnatural environment, people die without aging—or after a very short period of aging.\nFor instance, some markers, such as blood pressure, that tend to worsen over time for\nmoderns do not change over the life of hunter-gatherers until the very end.\nAnd this artificial aging comes from stifling internal antifragility.<p>In which he claims aging is misunderstood and proposes his new theory that it comes from too few stressors or too little recovery. Then he says that &quot;Much of aging comes from a misunderstanding of the effect of comfort - a disease of civilization&quot;.\nReally ? Aging comes from misunderstanding ?\nThis is just random babbling, there is no sense in it. Reasonable people don&#x27;t write or talk like this and those who do with such conviction as him are called... well, idiots.<p>>polyglot who writes classical Greek, Arabic, French, English and can do advanced statistical modeling is clearly an idiot right?<p>If he is in fact a polyglot and in fact can do advanced statistical modelling (the latter I very much doubt, the former I have no idea about) maybe he is not an idiot but some mental illness is taking a toll on him which makes him write and talk like one.  \nThe thing is there is no continuity, what he sees as arguments don&#x27;t even address the point. It&#x27;s just stream of words without any essence or meaning. I mean again, read the paragraph I quoted.. it&#x27;s not even cherry picked.

You possess the ability to build <i>tools</i> for businesses, which help them save/generate $X00,000 every year--don&#x27;t waste your time building brochure websites for $2000 when you can be doing <i>that</i>. (Of course, for certain businesses the website is just such a tool--and those businesses will be willing to invest far more in their websites. But a business that currently operates with a &quot;craptastic&quot; site probably isn&#x27;t that kind of business.)<p>Think of everyone you know, that you see or speak to on a semi-regular basis. Friends, family, colleagues, etc. Where do they work? Where do their spouses/significant others work? What did their parents do when they were growing up? Write down the answers that you know, and make a mental note of asking them next time you see them or speak to them. Then ask them more about it. (Oh, your wife works in the office at ___? What does she do, exactly? Actually, what does the company do, I&#x27;ve always wondered...) This isn&#x27;t an interview, and these aren&#x27;t &quot;leads&quot;--you&#x27;re just getting used to talking to people about work things, and familiarizing yourself with different industries. You&#x27;ll probably realize that you have several contacts working in the similar industries--that might be important later.<p>Now, register a business name. Print some business cards. Make yourself a really simple single-page site. You&#x27;re a &quot;software development consultant&quot; and you help businesses increase their profits by increasing revenue and reducing expenses. You build tools that save employee time by automating repetitive tasks. You build tools that help sales & marketing departments identify their best leads. You build tools that increase public exposure and make it easier for consumers to buy from your client (if the client business is consumer-facing), possibly directly online (I&#x27;m talking about websites/mobile apps). Now, buy a ticket to an event sponsored by your local chamber of commerce. You&#x27;ll be directed to a table (or pick one, I guess, depending how things are run). Introduce yourself to the people at your table. Give them your business card. Ask them questions about their business, and <i>genuinely give a shit about what they say</i> (if you can&#x27;t do that part, at least most of the time, this isn&#x27;t going to work).<p>No one is going to hire you after that first event, because none of them will understand what you had to say. Practice communicating what you do. Also, think about everyone you met and try to imagine the problems they must face in their business every day. (You should have asked them that when you met them. They may or may not have had any good answers.) You don&#x27;t have to pitch them on your ideas, not the first time around--it&#x27;s just a mental exercise.<p>Rinse and repeat. You will eventually find someone who has been looking for your services. They&#x27;re your first client. Once you get the hang of building tools that make business owners richer, and especially once you gain a track record of doing so, your services sell themself. When you get to that point, it&#x27;s just a matter of closing. You go to networking events, you talk to people and exchange business cards. Later that day you send them an email saying &quot;Hey, after we chatted I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about the problem you mentioned. Would it work to [X, Y, Z with software]?&quot; They will be interested, you&#x27;ll then tell them you can do it. You set up a meeting to discuss specifics, then you sell them your services.<p>That&#x27;s the secret!<p>PS. A helpful side note, which I probably picked from reading patio11 at some point: you should basically think of your business as trying to replace pen and paper, or giant Excel spreadsheets, with custom software. You can easily book yourself solid just doing that single task for every business you come across, and you will be providing an exceptionally valuable service. Suddenly the information which used to be in a stack of filing cabinets is no longer vulnerable to a office fire or a office flood (as long as you implement a good backup system--which is an upsell--and store their files in a remote server) and their giant collection of Excel files gets replaced with a database that&#x27;s easy to search, with fine-grained access control and multiple users editing at once.",1389821660

7066302,comment,7062923,7064885,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> The relevant sense of &quot;common carrier&quot; in this context is as a classification in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. It&#x27;s a detailed set of regulations applicable to telephone companies.  Classifying ISPs as &quot;common carriers&quot; would not just implicate all of those regulations, but implicate one of the animating principles of phone service under the Telecom Act of 1996, which is universal service.<p>You are conflating two related but distinct issues, and then compounding that by badly confusing the issue of universal service. Of the conflated issues:<p>First, is requirements that <i>define</i> a common carrier, which the FCC can apply to entities designated as &quot;telecommunications providers&quot; under the Telecommunications Act but cannot apply to entities designated as &quot;information service providers&quot; under the Act, per the DC Circuit ruling recently, those requirements include things like the non-discrimination/non-blocking rules in the recent <i>Open Internet Order</i>. Designating a new category of &quot;telecommunications service providers&quot; (provided such designation survives any challenge -- there are definitions of what consistutes telecommunication service in the Act and the FCC would have to have reasonable grounds for this designation) allows the FCC to apply provisions that are essentially common carrier rules to entities in the newly defined category.<p>Second, is the <i>particular</i> regulations that the FCC <i>has</i> applied to particular classes of telecommunications providers, such as landline telephone providers. Designating a new class of telecommunications service providers would not automatically apply any existing regulations that the FCC has adopted for previously-defined classes of telecommunications providers to the newly identifed class.<p>Finally, universal service is not an &quot;animating principle of phone service under the Telecom Act of 1996&quot;. Universal service was adopted for phone service in the Communications Act of 1934. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was notable in expanding the role of universal service to include &quot;advanced telecommunication and information services&quot;. This expressly includes non-common carrier &quot;information services&quot; as well as common carrier &quot;telecommunication services&quot;, so it is completely irrelevant tot he common carrier issue.<p>> &quot;Common carrier&quot; is also a classification for various services under common law, but that&#x27;s not what the recent D.C. Circuit opinion was about.<p>Actually, applying the common law definition of &quot;common carrier&quot; to the particular regulations that the FCC adopted in the <i>Open Internet Order</i> to see if they conflicted with the Telecommunication Act&#x27;s provision that common carrier rules could be applied only to &quot;telecommunication service&quot; providers and not &quot;information service&quot; providers (given the FCC&#x27;s designation of ISPs as the latter rather than the former) was central to the DC Circuit decision.",1389821402

It&#x27;s like saying measuring temperature is better than measuring mass. Those are just different things to measure and saying one is less volatile isn&#x27;t really meaningful.

What&#x27;s this OpenResty that&#x27;s doing so well on the web frameworks benchmark? Maybe I should use that. So setup an Arch box and get that setup. Find Lapis and MoonScript and so I&#x27;ll use that. Now back to the coding. Strip everything I have done in Grails, using Lapis now.

Bluecalm began with a few paragraphs making the case that Taleb has pretensions of being an expert where he doesn&#x27;t know what he is talking about, and that his statements are unsupported.<p>Calling him a crank is a more objective statement, and to me seems to impute an unknowable motive to what Taleb is doing in these types of articles. Is it an egotistical attempt to feel important, a strategy to sell books, or does he believe all the stuff he says?<p>What I personally find so unpleasant and objectionable about Taleb is probably unfair, but he seems to fit the archetype of an entire group of people who make loud statements that are wrong or unsupported, but take a long and nuanced discussion to explain why.<p>For example he seems to be terrible at economic analysis, but portrays himself as an excellent trader so he asserts that scientific study of the economy is bunk. Let&#x27;s say that he really is an outlier in finance, operating with localized phenomena is different than having a comprehensive view of the economy and refining models.<p>I think his idea of Black Swans is incredibly useful, and it is interesting to explore the psychology of underestimating the likelihood of rare events. His contributions are less useful when he sounds like the people who say &quot;economics is not a science&quot;, before making a bold assertion about the economy that has no rigorous models to support it. Such situations are analogous to saying meteorology is not a science when it comes to forecasting whether or not it will rain in ten days. &quot;A science&quot; is a field where everything is known? &quot;A science&quot; is not a field where models are refined through research and experimentation? The science part of meteorology is the process of understanding the mechanisms behind how air masses interact and improving models, not predicting weather at a future date when a good deal of what will determine whether or not it rains has not yet occurred.",1389820091

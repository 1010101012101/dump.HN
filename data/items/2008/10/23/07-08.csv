The market has started to become modular, and us such 'good-enough' products will slowly eat away at the ipod, for a firm (opensource or otherwise) there needs to be a design-led core team to make decisions, to get working capital to manufacture, distribute, market etc (like mechanical_fish suggested).  Regarding the average consumer arguement,  to an average consumer  an ipod has become synonymous to a mp3 player, and as more and more generic 'ipods' flood the market apple will probably leave the market.",1224748799

You cannot employ this hack if you are using S3 in a meaningful way. Thus, you are simply getting a max 25% refund on the money you spent gaining nothing.",1224748775

There are probably other twitter-ish aggregation start-up ideas that you might be able to get out of this.... e.g. send an sms/mms and it's posted as ""news"" for that geographic area. You could then aggregate news for relevance for a given area (e.g. local, state, national, world).",1224748602

It's a feature that I am sure many would enjoy, and a true hacker would rise to the occasion and try to implement it for all to play around with.<p>Sadly I am a designer who merely dabbles with code, let alone something as high-level as Arc or Lisp.<p>Also, and I mentioned this in my initial post but it might not be entirely clear, sometimes the stories I don't want to see aren't stories I plan on visiting. One technique would be just opening and quickly closing those links I don't have any desire to look at.<p>The final reason I think that this could be useful, is that I tend to work across multiple machines, one or two at work and a laptop (which I am writing this on now) at home. It would help to flip those stories I have seen at work so that when I am at home, I can check out the fresh stories and not have to sift through stories I have already seen or have no interest in.",1224748230

I'd guess that most users would not use more to see other stories. This approach would let you see 30 of interest...<p>This would lead to more upvoting on stories that don't make the top 30. I guess this would keep the front page ""fresher"" by allowing for a greater diversity in where upvotes go.<p>To be honest, not sure what the effect would be overall - fresher doesn't necessarily imply a better SnR - but I don't think it's as simple as re-visiting links or the change in color for a:visited.",1224748211

You want a large increase in server side complexity just to save you from re-visiting links that you have been to before but did not like.

340991,comment,333464,333675,0,0,spif,,,"I equate the statement that ""throw hardware at the problem"" in the case of Rails to be uneducated. The whole myth that Rails doesn't scale is becoming annoying. The video explains that it's not a framework or language that doesn't scale - it's either CPU bound or IO bound. Saying that Rails quates to 'throwing hardware' at a problem is silly because there are waaaaay more variables and once you get to the bottom of the problem you'll see that the framework makes little difference. In our case (soocial.com) we use rails for our webapp and ruby for most syncing bots - the bottle neck has been the database and never really rails. And we don't expect it to be.",1224747761

Unfortunately I was sort of hoping he would take the Programming Pearls approach instead of treating it as a joke.  Bently showed several ways to do this kind of constrained memory sorting given differing assumptions, but perhaps that kind of thing just isn't interesting for the places Python is used.",1224747255

340983,comment,340866,340866,0,0,qhoxie,,,"It kind of depends what constitutes the ""open source community.""  If by that you mean anyone who wants to thrown in, then the community could <i>design</i> a better audio player.  Googling 'ipod concept' turns up some pretty neat ideas.  As for actually being able to produce it: probably not.  Companies like Canonical do great work pushing open software forward, but an undertaking like competing with the ipod is a bit much for anyone to venture in to.  This is especially true because Apple would not lose any share without a fight, and when it comes to sexiness - they win.",1224745908

A part of it, I think, was that I didn't really feel like I was contributing anything new - and, in fact, I wasn't. Once I started pruning myself, revising things, focusing on really creating meaningful stuff, then I found that I didn't care so much about comments: I started to make things for the sake of those things rather than for personal vanity.<p>I think that's a big part of things too. Criticism can get you on the right track. Once you're there, if you don't leave the track criticism stops mattering. I don't know if it's a matter of thick skin - I'm a fairly sensitive person in many ways. It's more a matter of your realizing that some critics are wrong, and ignoring them to continue what you do best.",1224745360

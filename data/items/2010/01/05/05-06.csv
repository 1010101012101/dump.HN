Perhaps Apple also realized that other parties were getting a bit too much insight into their marketplace through advertising.<p>If I'm right, this could be very unpleasant for advertising-related startups in this space that aren't Quattro.

And how useful can a train be that seems to stop nowhere? A normal number of stops (say ten) would add at least one hour to the traveling time. But, yeah, that is still damn impressive.<p>I also don’t think that the Munich-Hamburg connection mentioned in the article (somewhat more than 600 km) is very impressive: you will still be in the train for five hours and thirty minutes (you will pay 130 €). Which is not that much faster than the mentioned US connection.<p>We Europeans have our fair share of problems with upgrading our train networks (as opposed to pretty much starting from scratch). There are dense existing network but those were built decades, maybe even a century ago. Maintaining them is expensive and upgrading them for highspeed trains is probably not much cheaper than starting from scratch would be (new tracks, new course, electrification, etc. – there really is not much you can reuse). Europe is also densly populated, with fewer huge centers. You can’t just send a train 600 km through Germany without stopping at least half a dozen times.",1262669488

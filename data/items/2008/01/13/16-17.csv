I hope they succeed.",1200243328

Americans think a third of the federal budget goes to foreign aid. Ridiculous.<p>Such a small percentage of people work in farming that it should be easy to convince people to make the change. People fear the lobby.",1200243161

97876,comment,97829,97829,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't.  I work from about 10 AM to 2 AM, but according to RescueTime, the actual amount of time spent coding tops out at about 6-7 hours, with an average of about 4.5.<p>That's slightly more than when I had a full-time job (I averaged about 2-3 hours then), but seems fairly constant over a bunch of employers.  And employers know this.  My first boss told me, ""Nobody expects you to spend the whole 8 hours working, just as long as you're getting <i>something</i> done with the day.  That's why contractors get paid twice as much hourly as employees - they can only bill for the time they're actually working.""",1200242252
97875,comment,97829,97829,0,0,bcater,,,"Dale Carnegie wrote about guys working in a foundry who, the experts calculated, should be able to carry 47 tons of pig iron per day, yet they were only actually able to carry 12 (or something similarly smaller than 47). Upon closer inspection, Carnegie noted that the workers took no more than a short break for lunch each day, so he advised them to sit and rest for a pre-determined amount of time each hour to renew their strength. As if by magic, the men were all then able to carry the predicted 47 tons per day, leaving employees and management quite satisfied.<p>Your brain is no different in its need for rest than your body. I've discovered that I need a break at about 3pm every afternoon, so I find a quiet place to lay down, close my eyes, and think about precisely nothing. After ten or fifteen minutes, I am ready to go back to thinking very hard. I've had co-workers who choose to sit at their desks all day looking very diligent rather than rest when they need it, and they are far less productive. (Of course, there are a few out there who don't seem to need to ever rest, and they're much more productive than I.)<p>You're not being paid to log hours; you're being paid to accomplish something. If you meet or exceed your employers' requirements for you, then they are getting their money's worth.",1200241502

A really cool book for someone to write would be a collection of best practices for solving problems with money.",1200241361

As is this:<p><pre><code>    def thing(something: ""A string!"") -> ""does stuff"":

It's also not explicitly checked, although if you felt like it you could probably write a metaclass to enforce type checking. (Though I imagine to do so would be rather un-pythonic)",1329011851

It kind of looks like a way of randomly jumbling a bunch of stuff together, which I assure you, I can achieve on my own :).<p>Overall, I have to admit that I'm skeptical about the whole enterprise of contextual mapping, but one of the things that could possibly convince me to try your software would be if the implementation looked exceedingly simple and well-executed. One of the reasons a lot of contextual map software fails is that clicking and dragging things around is extremely tedious, and with most software, the interactions are not implemented very well. I'm talking about things like: distinguishing click-moves and click-edits, or boxes in a flow chart staying connected to each other when I drag them around.<p>Think about the whiteboard you're trying to replace (I think). The reason a whiteboard works so well is that it's incredibly easy to put any kind of data into it, because drawing things on a whiteboard is trivial. You don't have the ability to draw that way with a computer program, so whatever facilities replace drawing need to be comparably easy to use.",1329011390

3580797,comment,3579847,3579847,28,0,sdfjkl,,,"Many years ago I've decided it was time to pick up a modern programming language. In the past I had written lots of (Turbo) Pascal code, some x86 (and more exotic) Assembler and a bit of C, but then for several years I only did shell/awk scripts and ported C software to IRIX and SINIX/RU.<p>So I sat down and decided to find a nice general-purpose language that I would focus on learning. I wasn't quite sure what for yet, but I decided I was going to pick one and stick with it. I didn't have the time to learn multiple languages and I didn't have a lot of time to try out different ones, so I just looked around a little bit. Some I ruled out early: C and it's relatives were just too verbose, I didn't want to spend the time writing all the error handling necessary just to read a damn file. I was doing a lot of sysadmin type work at the time and had therefore developed an intense disliking for Java. This was based on too much badly packaged Java software that even if you got it running at all was sluggish, hogging way too much memory and crashed with arcane error messages. I did like the quick & dirty way I could make things work in a shell script, so I looked mostly at scripting languages.<p>I looked at Perl, which was the standard scripting language at the time and had a huge library (CPAN) of modules, which was great. I hated the syntax though and found the code often unreadable and there being too many ways of doing the same thing.<p>I looked at Pike, which had the benefit of using a C syntax (which I already knew, so that was a plus), but it seemed not widely supported and nobody was using it (this hasn't changed since, it seems).<p>I don't remember what else I looked at, but then there was Python. The syntax was a revelation. Here someone had finally made the most of creating a language from scratch and spent the time thinking about syntax and how to do away with largely pointless stuff (brackets), replacing it with things that everyone did anyways (indentation). It also came with a sizeable library of stuff that did almost everything I could dream of at the time. It was love at first sight.<p>Recently I've spent 35 on a stainless steel mill that grinds salt when you twist it one way and pepper when you twist it the other way, just because I really love well thought out and engineered things that make stuff that's been around forever just a little bit better. That's how I feel about Python. It's not doing anything fantastically new or unique, but it's doing the stuff that others do just a little bit better.<p>Today I'm doing lots of web stuff, some sysadmin stuff and random hacking of various things on the side. I'm still doing almost everything in Python and whenever Javascript bitches at me about a missed semicolon I do think: ""All these fantastic things you can do in a web browser these days and you couldn't figure out that this command in an entirely different line isn't part of the previous line?"".<p>The only thing that I can't do in Python is write software for my iPhone, which bugs me a bit. But every time I try to get into Objective C I just get annoyed by the syntax and amount of cruft I have to write to do anything.",1329011055

3580792,comment,3577454,3577454,2,0,onlawschool,,,"The file-sharing/theft analogy is a fairly sound one. If I steal tangible property--say, a pack of gum--very few people would argue that my decision to do so was ethically defensible. Given that intangible property--say, a song--may be much more expensive to produce and arguably adds much more social value for having been created, why should we treat intangible property any differently?<p>Lets keep analogizing...<p>Like the manufacturer of the pack of gum, the song's creator has invested time and money into the development, production, and distribution of that product. And like the gum, the song has some intrinsic value (or else why would I take the time to download and listen to it?). Why should I be able to realize that value for my benefit without compensating the person responsible for its creation any more than I should be able to enjoy a delicious pack of bazooka joe without ponying up to the candy store?<p>One might argue that the ability to reproduce the digital download without imposing any cost on the creator of the intellectual property differentiates the intangible from the tangible. If my friend has 10 apples for sale at $1 a piece and I eat one while he isn't looking, he now only has 9 apples that he can sell, limiting his maximum gross revenue to $9. This feels wrong because the product is tangible & the loss quantifiable. On the other hand, if my other friend records a digital video that she is selling and I download it for free, she can still sell 10 more copies of the song and earn $10. However, had I paid for the download, she would have $11 rather than $10.<p>In each case, my unauthorized consumption left the person who had spent their own resources (both human and capital) with $1 less at the end of the day.<p>I might try and justify having downloaded the video for free by telling myself that my illicit consumption whet my appetite for her films, making me more likely to make purchases from her in the future. However, the same could be said for the juicy apple that I took from my other friend. Perhaps because I stole my first apple I will now come back and patronize his fruit stand regularly. Ultimately he will sell more fruit because of my indiscriminate apple theft, yet my original sin still feels unethical. As well it should.<p>When Curebit allegedly violated the intellectual property rights of 37 Signals, they suffered quite the backlash here on HN (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3523024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3523024</a>).<p>Of course, it is easy to distinguish between downloading someone's intellectual property for personal use and misrepresenting another's intellectual property as your own, especially for commercial purposes. Yet, at their core, both acts simply represent varying degrees of the same unethical behavior.<p>Like it or not, your gain, whether tangible or intangible, comes at the expense of the counter-party to the would-be transaction. Further, if enough people felt justified in their apple theft, it would be harder to find a decent fruit stand. Fruit vendors would close up shop or begin selling cheaper, lower-quality apples in order to minimize their losses to theft. Similarly, if enough people feel as though misappropriating intellectual property is acceptable, it is much more difficult for creators of such to continue to afford create.<p>The ability to monetize one's work, whether it be apple mongering or song writing, incentivizes and finances the production and distribution of higher quality apples and songs. Remove those incentives and both the artist and the entrepreneur will ultimately be unable to sustain their efforts in the long-run.",1329010926

What is Apple going to do? Turn me over to the RIAA? Obviously not. At the very worst as far as I can guess, they could great a recommendation engine and try to upsell me more music that I might like. Sort of how a radio station works (inefficiently) or how a home town record store owner used to work (""Hey man did you check out Dylan's latest?"") If they shove recommendations at me through email, ping or a ""suggestions"" feature in iTunes, I can ignore it.

I'm no musician, nor do I have much experience with DAWs, but the ideal environment, and this is true for many things, would be one that is both expressive and easy to use. I just can't see how exploding all the components in such a manner is reaching those said goals. Why can't you just explode them when need be?<p>Also, why is the quality of immersion important to you? Immersion as it is well known does not make for effective or powerful interfaces.

For whatever reason this space seems to consistently attract shady and/or underqualified people. I think the reason is that education is an area where you can't really contribute anything of value unless you are well versed in the science. Because of this it's really easy to snow virtually everyone, from investors and the media to school administrators and teachers.

3580705,comment,3579847,3580041,4,0,chernevik,,,"Ruby/Rails seems to have a more developer-friendly approach to the web development stack than Python/Django.  (I am but an egg, more comfortable in Python/Django but learning Ruby/Rails, I wouldn't argue with more experienced folks about any of the following.)<p>Ruby/Rails seems easier to develop and test the full stack application, from client JavaScript to server Ruby response and back.  It supports Ajax through injection of injection of JavaScript into HTTP responses served up, based on specifications in server side code.  The test architectures seem to reach across the client/server divide, for example checking server side responses to triggering client-side JavaScript.<p>Python/Django are trying, with like lettuce and splinter, but these don't yet seem to be quite to the same standard.<p>Also, because RoR has a lead on web development, new developments in that space seem generally better integrated.  For example, Backbone is a young JavaScript MVC style framework for client side development.  I've just been fooling with using it with Django, and discovered that its stringification of Json objects for POST doesn't work with Django's parsing of the client request.  Maybe more experienced developers spotted and fixed this easily -- my fix is only a couple of lines -- but it's the sort of thing that makes me wonder just how many folks have tried to integrate Django w/ Backbone.  I'm guessing that the Backbone community has already spotted and fixed any such issues with RoR.<p>Now I'm not sure how I feel about RoR, it often feels like magic and I'm a little suspicious of stuff like super-convenient JavaScript injection.  Maybe when I understand it better it will seems less magical and more convenient.  But it isn't hard to see why the web development community likes it.",1329008656

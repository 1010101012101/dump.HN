Code is just a medium; it is under no obligation to you.<p>I think sometimes developers forget about coding as a means of artistic expression. I love Ruby for pretty much the exact same reasons so many of you dislike it: It's an amazingly expressive language and code like this is nothing but art.",1232593072
444258,comment,443477,443603,0,0,apsurd,,,"To reply to your points specifically...<p>1. There will always be a need for things. So there will always be customers. There will always be capital available. Always. Think about the great depression. There were still very rich people. So I think it is not so valuable to argue in absolutes, as long as there exist customers and capital we have an economy, the issue is not how small, hard or tight, if it exist, then there will be entrepreneurs.<p>2. Your quoted statement says ""the desire- the need to innovate never goes away. The author is talking about the personal and obsessive need of the entrepreneur, not ""needs"" in general. And your example of a need for safe drinking water... that need will be filled when there's money to be made in filling that need....",1232593067

Skate parks are everywhere (I would have killed for a decent skate park when I was a kid), there's an ocean an hour drive away, mountains not much further, a big and really interesting city is an hour train ride away, the weather is nice enough to go outside almost year round (it's maybe a little chilly for me now, since I spent 10+ years in Texas, but I would have loved it when I was a kid growing up on the east coast), there's a reasonable music and arts scene (mainly in the city, but near enough to feel it and take part), the small towns around here are extremely walkable/bikeable, and there's good mass transit for the places you can't get on foot or bike.  Palo Alto is not a suburban wasteland, and yet, there are lots of places where it's quiet and low traffic.",1232592444

I would have never applied to YC if YC were always in Boston, so there must be someone out there who would never apply if it's always in California.  Does that mean that, right now, a technically savvy angel out in Boston could start snatching up some of the MIT and Harvard alumni startups that YC ordinarily would have first dibs on?  I dunno, but I guess if I were an investor in Boston, I'd be thinking about how to put myself in that position.",1232592030

444235,comment,443800,443800,0,0,justindz,,,"""You have one goal: to connect with your audience. Therefore, you must track what your audience is feeling at all times. One of the biggest problems I face when watching other people’s movies is I’ll say, ‘This part confuses me’, or whatever, and they’ll say, ‘What I’m intending to say is this’, and they’ll go on about their intentions. None of this has anything to do with my experience as an audience member. ""<p>I opine on this in poetry a lot.  People have a tendency to write some super vague poem that completely washes over the audience, and so rather than fix it, they include a preamble that makes the subsequent poem pointless.  Then you call them on that and they say ""Well, I just write for myself.""<p>If that's so, why are you reading it to a live audience and asking for feedback?  If you're not writing it for the audience, save the audience the trouble.  I'm sure it's the same way for movies, presentations and pretty much any performance.<p>In fact, I wrote a poem bashing this very practice recently.

Just because someone hands you a form contract doesn't mean you have to sign it as is.  IP's tricky, but basically you own what you author until you assign the rights (unless it's a ""work for hire"", which generally doesn't apply, see the Wiki).  The company you're freelancing for likely expects that you'd be signing over all the rights to the work product to them -- they're paying for it, after all.  If you expect otherwise, then you should document that you're only providing them with an indefinite license to use (they'll probably want the right to modify and own all mods).",1232590845

It does a lot more than just simple AB testing but is quite expensive (we were quoted around $10k/month when I played with it at my last company).<p>Genetify looks pretty cool and I'll spend some time playing with it.  One thing I wish all these frameworks had is hooks for testing things server-side rather than with client Javascript.  This would make it a lot easier to test process flows (i.e. ""one-page form versus wizard"") in addition to individual page elements.<p>If there are other open-source options out there, I'm looking forward to hearing about them.",1232590825

You won't find Seattle going from 80 degrees and muggy to 30 degrees and snowing over the course of 12 hours -- this happened while I was in Boston in April of a year that hopefully someone else here can fill in.<p>It might be a bit soft, but I think of it as removing weather from the list of things that distract you from more important work.",1232590732

I wanted to have a &quot;simple&quot; loop over some code instantiating several templates. I say simple, because I had first written the same code in Python and found out it was too slow for my purposes and thus rewrote in in C++. In Python this loop is dead simple to implement, just use a standard for loop over a list of factory functions. In C++ I pay for the high efficiency by turning this same problem in an advanced case of template meta programming that in the end didn&#x27;t even work out for me because one of the arguments was actually a &quot;template template&quot;. And on the other hand, making the C++ meta programming environment more powerful has its own set of problems: <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3613.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n361...</a>",1403271122

7920571,comment,7919683,7920303,15,0,userbinator,,,"I think the underlying cause of this <i>over</i>abstraction is largely a result of abstraction being excessively glorified (mostly) by academics and formal CS curricula. In some ways, it&#x27;s similar to the OOP overuse that has thankfully decreased somewhat recently but was extremely prevalent throughout the 90s. In software engineering, we&#x27;re constantly subjected to messages like: Abstraction is good. Abstraction is powerful. Abstraction is the way to solve problems. More abstraction is better. Even in the famously acclaimed SICP lecture series [1] there is this quote:<p>&quot;So in that sense computer science is like an abstract form of engineering. It&#x27;s the kind of engineering where you ignore the constraints that are imposed by reality.&quot;<p>There is an implication that we should be building more complex software just because we <i>can</i>, since that is somehow &quot;better&quot;. Efficiency is only thought of in strictly algorithmic terms, constants are ignored, and we&#x27;re almost taught that thinking about efficiency should be discouraged unless absolutely necessary because it&#x27;s &quot;premature optimisation&quot;. The (rapidly coming to an end) exponential growth of hardware power made this attitude acceptable, and lower-level knowledge of hardware (or just simple things like binary/bit fields) is undervalued &quot;because we have these layers of abstraction&quot; - often leading to adding another layer on top just to reinvent things that could be easily accomplished at a lower level.<p>The fact that many of those in the demoscene who produce amazing results yet have never formally studied computer science leads me to believe that there&#x27;s a certain amount of indoctrination happening, and I think to reverse this there will need to be some very massive changes within CS education. Demoscene is all about creative, pragmatic ways to solve problems by making the most of available resources, and that often leads to very simple and elegant solutions, which is something that should definitely be encouraged more in mainstream software engineering. Instead the latter seem more interested in building large, absurdly complex, baroque architectures to solve simple problems.\nMaybe the &quot;every byte and clock cycle counts&quot; attitude might not be ideal either for all problems, but not thinking at all about the amount of resources really needed to do something is worse.<p>> how much layers is <i>too much</i> layers?<p>Any more than is strictly necessary to perform the given task.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY#t=10m28s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY#t=10m28s</a>",1403270699

When it comes to wireline ISP&#x27;s, net neutrality proponents can justify regulation on the basis of local monopolies, etc. But in the U.S., over 200 million people have at least three options for 4G LTE service. And Sprint already covers 35 million people with LTE and is growing its footprint. You also have regional carriers like U.S. Cellular who have deployed LTE. And you have T-Mobile as the underdog player engaging in a real price/service war with the bigger competitors. Calling for regulation here is just calling for rules that favor one industry over another.<p>And it&#x27;s not just cellular companies that are hurt by such regulation. I used to work at a startup developing wireless technology. If you legislate cellular wireless into a low-margin, &quot;dumb pipe&quot; business, then those companies will have less money/incentive for R&D, and you&#x27;ll end up hurt companies like ours.<p>And by banning bundling, you&#x27;re eliminating the opportunities for real innovation in the sector. One of the ripest opportunities in the music/movie streaming sector is figuring out how to deploy it in mobile networks in a bandwidth-effective way. Bandwidth, especially mobile bandwidth, doesn&#x27;t rain down like mana from heaven. Someone has to build the cell towers, someone has to lay the fiber for the backhaul. What if your startup idea involves helping cellular wireless companies distribute media content more efficiently using their existing infrastructure?

However, making it <i>explicitly</i> illegal could have a beneficial effect in that it would empower corporations to not comply.<p>There are probably a lot of companies that find backdoor type requirements burdensome, and are only complying because the law is secret, uncertain or unfavorable to freedom. If you passed a law that said, &quot;Complying with any request, including those issued by government agencies, to insert a backdoor into or otherwise weaken the security of a cryptographic protocol is illegal&quot; and imposed some steep fines for violators, then companies would be in the opposite position from the one they are now, and they cautious position would be one where they say, &quot;Sorry, government, if anyone found out we did that we could get shut down or lose a ton of money.&quot;<p>That said, an engineering solution is a much more attractive one to me than a social/administrative solution.

It was amazing how efficient programs were and the genius of the software engineers.&quot;<p>I think software is already getting there, since we&#x27;ve been dealing with slowing returns for a while. The previous generation of languages like Python, Perl, Ruby, etc. traded convenience for performance and waited for hardware to catch up. It was a good trade in many cases at the time, but as we collectively learned more about the design space I think it has become clear that it is not an intrinsic trade; it is possible to get a more convenient language that we had in the 80s or 90s without trading away performance.<p>LuaJIT was an early example of this, but the flood gates are opening now. Go is not architected to the nth degree for speed, but it&#x27;s a language that&#x27;s only slightly slower than C, and in my experience, only slightly slower to develop in than Python (possible with a crossover point as the program size grows where Go is simply faster). Rust ought to be a lot easier to work with than C++ once you learn it, and I expect it to reach near-optimal speeds, possibly even beating C/C++ in practice as it will be more feasible to perform some aggressive optimizations for multithreading. And I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of the other little bubbling languages that may become languages of the future, like Nimrod, have the same sort of focus in them, &quot;how can we get these convenient features <i>without</i> a 20-100x speed penalty&quot;?<p>Then, once you have these languages, I&#x27;m noticing that in many cases while bindings exist, entire stacks are being rewritten to be simpler and faster. Go has its own webserver. Dollars-to-donuts Rust will too in another couple of years. I suspect this is actually part of the trend; rather than binding to older, huge frameworks and code written without much concern for latency issues, etc, more code is going to start being rewritten to care more about those things. Between mobile pressing us on one end and desktop speed advancement stalling out on the other, there&#x27;s increasing motivation to write faster code where it matters, without necessarily having to use C or C++.<p>I&#x27;m not saying paradise is incoming, but I get the impression that we&#x27;re seeing more care about performance manifesting in real languages and code than we used to.",1403269504

If you were to slam on the brakes with a joystick, the force would push you (and the joystick) forward, disengaging the brakes and applying throttle.<p>My first instinct with a joystick based system with a car would be to have brake being forward, not back. (Forward push brakes are a common control element in hand controls for autos, e.g., those that are made for the handicapped.)",1403269433

I like the bumpers and the &quot;gravity&quot; well (I haven&#x27;t gotten past level three yet because I had to pause the game to come and praise it.). I like that you can get enhancements ala Arkanoid.  Once you get past the fact that this is a coolest variant of pong, you start to notice how simply beautiful this game is. I like the expressions of the bear and seeing him &quot;play&quot; the game. I like how when you lose a round your screen &quot;zaps&quot; out of focus, just like what you see when his screen goes out. Very nice webgl project!<p>Oh and this has a webRTC network play?!  This is the first web game I&#x27;ve played that I would honestly say I would pay to play (after I got a demo version first, of course). This is by the far one of the coolest projects I&#x27;ve seen posted on hacker news. Beats the hell out of 1024. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing!",1403269429

When someone poses you a problem, he is asking you to think of it as <i>he</i> does; but you might have more success by figuring out why <i>you</i> might be interested in the problem—a trick of which Feynman was a master.",1403269247

We are heading back to the days of 640k barrier or the old C-64 days. It was amazing how efficient programs were and the genius of the software engineers.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever had a &quot;golden age&quot; of software development. Sort of like going back to find examples of good art (in whatever medium) from decades ago, we end up with the impression that the scifi of Asimov&#x27;s era was somehow better than what we have today. Really, the crap just disappeared. Pointing to examples of good software in the 80s, certainly impressive feats can be found, doesn&#x27;t mean that they were the norm. Having worked on a lot of legacy projects, I can assure you there&#x27;s plenty of crap from that era as well.<p>What we end up with is a false impression of our current time. We see all the crap, we&#x27;re filtering it out now, and we think things must be worse now than they used to be. We just won&#x27;t know until we can have a proper retrospective in 10-20 years. Once the crap&#x27;s filtered out, what remains?",1403269234

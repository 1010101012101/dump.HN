However, due to temperatures staying near-zero it can be worse on a structure if it's regularly cycling below freezing at night.<p>I wouldn't trust the retaining wall if it wasn't at least 20"" of masonry when it's laterally unsupported. Flagstone walls here with lime mortar, laterally supported on floor and ceiling cope at around 14"" thick, at which point they can support 6' 11"" (by the municipal bylaw) of earth, his walls are laterally unsupported, and by law here can't support more than 3' 11"" (if built with a strength equivalent to 8"" of 15 Mpa poured concrete, locally about a 14"" flagstone wall). Well drained soil will help, but when you're building a wall into the face of a hill, you're being stupid and putting your house below-grade.<p>I seriously expect this house to fail in a bad winter.

Evidence strongly suggests Apple is avoiding GPLv3 (much less AGPLv3), so if you want Apple to invest in you then it's a no-go.<p>It depends also on the product and the market. If the AGPLv3 is for part of the code base while you have other parts which aren't, then that's different than having all AGPLv3 code.<p>Also, think back to the 1990s, when companies were hesitant to use GPL at all; eg, wouldn't use Linux because it was under the strange GPLv2 license. That's changed, but we're still in a period where people might not want to take a chance on v3 just because no on else has taken a chance on v3.",1329220607

3589626,comment,3587436,3587436,4,0,gioele,,,"Maybe it is me misunderstanding things, but Wayland and X11 are not technologies in contrast with each other.<p>Wayland is a glorified and up-to-date framebuffer and input system, X11 is a library that draws shapes and is responsible for delivering input from the user to the correct application.<p>I think the current situation is confusing because current X11 implementations not only do what X11 is meant to do, but they also need a way to push pixels to the framebuffer and listen to keystrokes. Basically X servers needed their own way to talk to the graphic card and they implemented it (decades ago). That part is almost completely independent from the protocol that draws shapes and routes input to applications. What Wayland is replacing is _that_ part, the part that deals with the framebuffer (that in the modern times is no longer a simple strip of memory region with RGB pixel data).<p>In the end we will have Wayland as the only owner of the graphic device and many clients, one of which will be the X server. When they say ""client-side decoration"" they are referring to the status quo: the Wayland client called X11 will draw the decorations (asking the WM to do that); nothing different from what we have now.<p>Once Wayland will be stable there will be other direct clients that will want to bypass X11: games probably, but also other multi-platform toolkit like Qt. And X12, eventually ;)<p>To me Wayland looks as the perfect example of how to move forward: make older unsustainable technologies coexist with newer technologies.",1329220216

I'm about to sound like I'm about 60, but please, bear with me.<p><i>Every meeting should have a clearly defined mission statement ... I hesitate to recommend having an ""agenda"" and ""agenda items"" because the word agenda implies a giant, tedious bulleted list of things to cover.</i><p>Yet an agenda is the best tool for controlling meetings if the chair is any good. It says ""this is what we will discuss and decide and <i>only</i> this"". A meeting should not be a free-form discussion -- leave that for chance encounters in the office kitchen. It's a transactional form of communication, a tool to make efficiently make collective decisions.<p><i>Do your homework before the meeting.</i><p>Which is why agenda are circulated -- and even more because:<p><i>Make it optional.</i><p>Yes! And as Tom DeMarco points out in (I believe) <i>The Deadline</i>, meetings which don't stick to the agenda lead inevitably to everyone having to come to every single meeting <i>just in case something gets decided</i>. If the agenda is trustworthy, people will stay away who should stay away; only interested parties -- who will do the homework because it's relevant to them -- will turn up.<p><i>Summarize to-dos at the end of the meeting.</i><p>These are called ""minutes"". Properly written minutes are very useful and they don't have to be in legalese. The University Computer Club at the University of Western Australia, where I studied, have excellent minutes[1], written with a sense of humour.<p>Before I came to my senses, I used to be involved in student politics. And if that unpleasant experience taught me anything, it was the power of meeting mechanics. A well-run meeting is an extremely useful institution. Get in, discuss, decide, get out. Bam. No ambiguity, nothing left hanging.<p>As a chair there is one rule that counts: don't let the meeting get side-tracked. Stick to the agenda, work it. People quickly learn that they need to get their stuff onto the agenda in advance and the whole process begins to work better. Discussions become more focused, decisions can be made quickly and efficiently.<p>Those who are interested might like to join an organisation like Toastmasters or the Penguin Club to hone their skills, or get involved in committee work, or join a union, incorporated club or political branch. The skills of running an effective meeting are very useful. I applied them during my capstone unit at uni; my team delivered 92% of agreed functionality on-time with no significant defects. And part of that was running tight meetings.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ucc.asn.au/infobase/minutes/2011/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucc.asn.au/infobase/minutes/2011/</a>",1329219684

USA already has a relatively decent national Rugby Union side - certainly not top drawer, but able to compete at World Cup level. The facilities could be relatively easily converted and while there are certainly game subtleties that are very different (a complete ban on forward passes, for example), it'd likely be an easier player transition than to soccer or basketball.<p>* International Rules Football. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_rules_football"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_rules_football</a>) An existing hybrid of Gaelic football (for which I'd be astonished if there weren't east coast teams...) and Aussie Rules Football. Again, American teams exist, the pitches would be relatively easily converted, the skills are based around ball carrying and throwing...<p>Universities make too much money from football to just kill it. Too many large franchises make enormous sums from it, too many towns have it as a significant percentage of GDP. No transition to a new code would ever be easy but, if the writing was on the wall, the financial incentive for (say) one of the large conferences to give 3 years notice of transition to a new code in preference seem enormous in comparison with simply shuttering.<p>(Now, speaking as a Brit sports fan, if North America could only switch from Baseball to T20 Cricket then.... ;-))",1329217576

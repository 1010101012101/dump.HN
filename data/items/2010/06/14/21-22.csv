1431167,comment,1430316,1430900,0,0,jakarta,,,"Yes, finding having a boom in natural resources does have the effect of crowding out other industries. I agree with you. That's ""Dutch Disease"" and you can find it in many well governed resource rich nations.<p>The poster above brings up Alberta, you bring up Norway.<p>But Dutch Disease is just one detrimental 'symptom' of the resource curse.<p>Some of the more adverse symptoms are increased levels of conflict and corruption and those are precisely the fears you need to have when looking at Afghanistan's potential mineral wealth because there is a lack of proper governance in place.<p>Now going back to your example, Norway -- and Alberta too. It is precisely because of their governance systems that they can harness natural resource wealth at more optimal levels than nations with the curse.<p>Norway for example has one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. That provides a mechanism for reinvesting the natural resource wealth into other industries. I am no experts on SWFs, but from my reading, Norway's SWF has a pretty good reputation.<p>To contrast that, look at some of the resource rich conflict nations in Africa. They don't have formal laws and organizations to structure transparent SWFs, they have swiss bank accounts that they use to raid government revenues and sometimes fund militias.<p>So it is good governance that helps minimize the friction caused by new found natural resource wealth and redistribute it in an optimal manner.",1276552738

This means the user can do pretty much what they want, without getting a programmer involved. And that's the killer feature, that more advanced or more specific solutions miss.<p>Let's take an example. If the user wants to stick some free-form text in between the end of sales records for one year and the start of the next, they are free to do that. In any less free-form application, they need to define a ""comment record"" or similar, and they probably need to get a programmer involved to do that. And although the SaaS web version of their ""database"" may have a better interface, in a lot of cases, having to get a tech involved to make that sort of change is not a compromise people want to make.<p>And they have a point. It's not a slight against programmers, it's just that when they need to make that change, you'll be 2 companies and 5 projects down the line, and it won't be possible. The article mentions a sheet that has been in use for 15 years - if that had been made as a proper program, at that time, it likely would have been done as, say, a VB application, with an MDB back-end, and it probably would have had purple buttons. The source code would now be lost, and if the business process changed at all, the choices would be a full re-code, or working around it. I would be surprised if in 15 years time, we don't look at today's pet technologies in the same way that you just did when you read VB and MDB.<p>For me, the direction that Excel, and other spreadsheet, need to take is the same route that browsers needed to take when IE6 ruled the world. We need standardisation, and innovation. I've written a couple of blogs on this, and for me, the way to go is a central repository of extensions (<a href=""http://edparcell.posterous.com/how-about-an-app-store-for-excel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edparcell.posterous.com/how-about-an-app-store-for-ex...</a> for more on that).

1430973,comment,1429790,1430026,0,0,btilly,,,"I'll be that math nerd.  His lifetime field goal percentage is 0.45.  That means that in a string of 16 attempts, one time out of 14,000 or so he'll have 16 misses in a row.  He's played over 1000 games, and in a typical game how many attempts does he have at a field goal?  A bad run as long as the one you are citing is not that surprising.<p>To settle the question, you have to collect more data and carefully analyze statistics.  And when you do that, the data doesn't support the existence of streaks.  But you don't believe those statistics.  How to convince you?<p>Well under your theory that there are streaks, you should expect to see record streaks out there that are longer than statistics would suggest possible.  For instance if there are 500 players across time who've had a .45 field goal percentage, who've averaged 20,000 shots each, statistics says that the record streak of consecutive field goals made should be somewhere in the range 18-23 or so.  If those people have even a slight tendency towards streaks on top of those percentages, you'd expect the length of the top streaks to get higher.  If, during a streak, they shoot about .55, then under the same assumptions the top streak should be 25-30 or so.<p>So we have a test.  Look at the longest streaks and see if they are longer than expected.  Not even a lot longer, just slightly longer will do.  Lots of sports keep track of lots of player stats, and streaks.  In a fascinating essay many years ago Stephen J. Gould pointed out that, across all sports tracked and all types of streaks records are kept for, all but one are within a statistically plausible range given the number of players, games, and their playing averages.<p>The lone exception is Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak in 1941.  That one is truly exceptional, a repeat is unlikely in the next thousand years.  However when you look at the second, third, etc performances, they are in line with what statistics suggests is likely.<p>Now what about this college kid that you were talking about?  The answer there is interesting.  College is played at a more varied level than the professional leagues.  Therefore there is more variation in player performance.  Exceptional performances become much more likely if you add even a small number of players who are hitting somewhat more reliably.  So his streak is not as impressive as it may seem.<p>Incidentally this applies to DiMaggio.  When he played, pro baseball wasn't as consistent as it is today, so he was able to sustain stats that were above what you find in today's players.  In fact <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204556804574261942466979118.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020455680457426...</a> reports on a Monte Carlo simulation of baseball that used every historical player and season with their actual hitting percentages.  Fully 42% of the simulated histories had a streak as long as DiMaggio's or longer.<p>Therefore even a slight tendency towards streaks should show up clearly in the record books.  But nowhere in the record books is there any streak that shows strong evidence of streakiness.",1276549608

Here are some points\n(1) Afghanistan's chunk of revenue from reserves will almost all come from Loyalties. They don't have engineers to design mines, no capital equipment to sell, no skilled labour, etc. At best, there will be a slight trickle of money to those serving food and cleaning at camps.\n(2) Loyalty revenue, in a country as corrupt as Afghanistan, is not going to go the people - at best a small slice might be used to build some infrastructure\n(3) All this foreign investment in the Country will lead to huge inflation which will make housing/food/etc even less affordable to the average afghani.<p>Source: I've lived-in and worked on mining projects in the developing world and saw all this stuff happen first hand.",1276549457

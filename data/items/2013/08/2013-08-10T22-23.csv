6192997,comment,6191403,6191708,1,0,mistercow,,,"I used to sell my software online (well, I still do, but not very actively). A few years ago, while searching out of curiosity, I found that a cracked license key for one of my apps had recently started floating around. Eventually I got around to disabling that key, but you know what notable difference I observed in sales before and after the cracked key became available? Zero.<p>Why? Because people either pay for software or they don&#x27;t. Some people who pay for software also pirate it. I have never encountered such a person who paid for software because they couldn&#x27;t pirate it; rather, they paid for it because they wanted to support the author.<p>Probably a few people like that do exist though, so out of the thousands of people pirating your software, you might have lost ten sales. Maybe. Generously. All of the others simply would have used something else if the cracked key hadn&#x27;t been available.<p>When many of us see a comment like yours, we feel much the same way that a mathematician probably feels when someone claims they have a proof that 0.9  1. It&#x27;s a broken argument that we&#x27;ve encountered many times before, and the fallacy of the argument is not even interesting to discuss anymore. Moreover, none of us have ever seen someone make that argument and then bring up interesting and novel points to the ensuing discussion. We know exactly how the conversation is going to go, and there&#x27;s little motivation to run through the motions of it again.",1376175571

No surprise since it was its intended purpose to be a format for documents.<p>Making any layouts and god forbid centering elements has always been a headache for me. Even by looking at the CSS examples provided by the link my first thought is how random they all seem and how ugly they are not to mention difficult to remember and use. There should be a single way to center an element. It should be an obvious operation given how important and common it is.<p>Some very useful CSS properties might take a lot of code and be hard to implement in native GUI toolkits like floats, overflow, height/width with percents, text wrapping etc. This is a sweet spot where HTML/CSS shines.<p>I have been playing with QML lately and decided to implement the Dialog (Absolute center within viewport) that pops after visiting the linked page just for comparison:<p>Here&#x27;s the dialog equivalent that just fills the entire screen of an application done with QtQuick 2.0 for Desktop.<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/mnN3Zr6N"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/mnN3Zr6N</a><p>Layouting is easily done by anchors. Filling a rectangle to match a parent&#x27;s container, centering an element inside a parent, etc. Other containers such as Rows, Columns or Grids are also provided. Property bindings are used for centering the dialog even if the viewport changes. Text wrapping is also done explicitly and binding was necessary to limit text width to the ScrollView for it to work.<p>One big difference compared to CSS is that by looking at the source I can see at glance what the layout structure is and what might be happening with the element.<p>Another cool thing about QML is that it&#x27;s as simple as taking the code, creating a new file &#x27;Dialog.qml&#x27;, adding a few properties, a signal and some functions and we get a reusable standalone component:<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/CSbxrnK3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/CSbxrnK3</a><p>that is very convinient to use:<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/XKnhW4wN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/XKnhW4wN</a><p>result: <a href=""http://i.minus.com/iGTQhAxP55bBP.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.minus.com/iGTQhAxP55bBP.gif</a> (3MB gif)",1376174466

That&#x27;s more than a small conflict of interest.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure I understand his point regarding email privacy vs. message-app privacy. Either of them could easily be subpoenaed in the U.S., and moving either of those services off-shore should theoretically provide the same protection.<p>Maybe the messages will be stored on Silent Circle servers in an encrypted state...?",1376172819

Apparently helping them get in touch with my flatmate -  who unbeknownst to me had <i>reported</i> a crime -  didn&#x27;t incriminate me or my flatmate. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m sure a <i>lawyer</i> would rather I had that two minute conversation in their paid presence, but I&#x27;m not really sure where they&#x27;d have helped me avoid accidentally intimating that I might be a criminal: I think I&#x27;d have done that more effectively by automatically assuming I was being investigated.<p>Assuming instantly pleading the Fifth helps misses the bit where police and especially more powerful organizations like the FBI jump to and act on a lot of conclusions that aren&#x27;t admissible in court (and of course have plenty of capability to find <i>non-verbal</i>, admissible evidence of wrongdoing if motivated to look for it, even if you&#x27;re innocent). If they&#x27;re casually following up a dubious lead, which they probably are if you&#x27;re not expecting their visit and don&#x27;t have pot plants or a server mirroring Wikileaks in your conservatory, you probably don&#x27;t want to fit their mental model of a suspect, which probably means you being at least <i>slightly</i> curious about why they want to speak to you, and at least willing to entertain the possibility that you&#x27;re not the suspect. Statistically, you&#x27;re more likely to plead the Fifth if you&#x27;re guilty.<p>(This probably doesn&#x27;t apply when they&#x27;re picking on you because you&#x27;re a genuine suspect or there are political reasons for them trying to find out about your friends or organization.)",1376172767

This week I was in France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and Germany all by car, all without needing my passport (except hotels, but they do <i>that</i> everywhere in the world).<p>Although it has gotten stricter in the last few years, flights from Germany to Norway, Sweden, or Denmark could routinely be boarded without showing any ID until recently. I live near the French border in Germany, but you wouldn&#x27;t even know when you&#x27;re crossing it. In &quot;heartland&quot; Europe, there are often no border stations at all. Sometimes you just notice you changed countries because the street signs look slightly different.<p>Compared to a lot of other countries, including the US, EU police are doing almost no traffic stops or other forms of public &quot;papers, please&quot; checks. The last time I was in a traffic stop was about 5 years ago, and I accrue about 50k kilometers a year.<p>Compare that to a random Asian country where police are sometimes lying in wait near ambiguous signage in order to catch expensive-looking rental cars passing through, or compare that to a rural sheriff in a southern US state who likes to capture (and throw in jail for a few hours with great fanfare) people passing by in out-of-state cars when they predictably go a little above the draconian speed limit on the completely empty and straight highway. In Cairo, you can&#x27;t even drive downtown from the airport without being stopped for ID at least twice.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing a bit of the picture because I don&#x27;t like to go by train, but overall movement in Europe seems a lot less restricted than pretty much everywhere else I&#x27;ve been to.",1376172391

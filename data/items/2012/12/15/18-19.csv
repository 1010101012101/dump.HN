Mistaking college for that is thinking college is trade school training. It generally hasn't been, it usually isn't, and it shouldn't be.<p>Loosely, the purpose of education ( as opposed to training ) is to provide (i) a broad base of understanding across a wide variety of areas nearly inaccessible without portals created by experts, (ii) a theoretical grasp of the field, providing a framework and sense of theoretical possibilities present, past, and future, (iii) a structured and systematic mechanism to go through these subject areas in ways that are (a) thought-through, (b) approximately complete, and (c) pedagogically competent, and finally, (iv) a standard way to attain a certain competence in the area that is generally agreed upon to provide a base understanding.<p>It would be disingenuous to suggest, imply, or to ignore the fact that many educational institutions do not fully live up to their promise. It would also be disingenuous to ignore the fact that a vast number of incoming students really just want to be trained for a job and go make a decent wage, which is an <i>entirely morally acceptable desire</i>.

If I wasn't taking any classes, I was working full-time so that  during the long semesters, I could work only part-time and still be able to pay rent. Spring break meant I could get a little boost to get me through until summer.<p>I just finished yesterday and I'm intensely relieved. I will have so much more free time than I've had the last several years. Maybe I can start a side project or contribute to open source. I'm playing a video game right now.

However, without substantial self-education in areas you might not be interested in, the limitation of a CS degree is that it still has some rather large gaps in terms of what you are exposed to.

Which is a good rule of thumb for most things.<p>With the hindsight of plenty of time in the field, I find it remarkable how many fundamental concepts you still need to learn that they do not teach in current CS programs. In my area of work, massively parallel algorithms and distributed systems, the core theory, never mind practice, still has to be learned outside of school and the initial barriers are not trivial.

A bunch of modern internet-sized problems end up being streaming problems (<a href=""http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/streaming-algorithms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/streaming-algorithms.ht...</a>), and you need to understand basic space complexity, linear algebra, and probability, all of which a good CS degree will get into your head. I think the role of a good CS degree is to get some theory into people's heads, so that they have the right cognitive models for tackling difficult problems that come up in the real world.<p>I'm not saying that a CS degree is necessary to be a good programmer, or that you can't pick up those mental tools without a CS degree if you need them. But, it is easiest for most people to learn that kind of stuff in a university environment. I for one didn't know that I needed theory to work on the sorts of massive-data problems I was interested in, before going to university.

Creative machines that actually understand language and the world around it. The ""hard"" AI problems of vision and commonsense reasoning will become ""easy"". You need to program a computer the logic that all people have hands or that eyes and noses are on faces. They will gain this experiences and they learn about our world, just like their biological equivalent, children.<p>Here's some more food for thought from Jeff Hawkins:<p>""John Searle, an influential philosophy professor at the University of California at Berkeley, was at that time saying that computers were not, and could not be, \nintelligent. To prove it, in 1980 he came up with a thought experiment called the Chinese Room. It goes like this:<p>Suppose you have a room with a slot in one wall, and inside is an English-speaking person sitting at a desk. He has a big book of instructions and all the pencils and scratch paper he could ever need. Flipping through the book, he sees that the instructions, written in English, dictate ways to manipulate, sort, and compare Chinese characters. Mind you, the directions say nothing about the meanings of the Chinese characters; they only deal with how the characters are to be copied, erased, reordered, transcribed, and so forth.<p>Someone outside the room slips a piece of paper through the slot. On it is written a story and questions about the story, all in Chinese. The man inside doesn't speak \nor read a word of Chinese, but he picks up the paper and goes to work with the rulebook. He toils and toils, rotely following the instructions in the book. At times \nthe instructions tell him to write characters on scrap paper, and at other times to move and erase characters. Applying  rule after rule, writing and erasing \ncharacters, the man works until the book's instructions tell him he is done. When he is finished at last he has written a new page of characters, which unbeknownst \nto him are the answers to the questions. The book tells him to pass his paper back through the slot. He does it, and wonders what this whole tedious exercise has \nbeen about.<p>Outside, a Chinese speaker  reads the page. The answers are all correct, she notes— even insightful. If she is asked whether those answers came from an intelligent mind that had understood the story, she will definitely say yes. But can \nshe be right? Who understood the story? It wasn't the fellow inside, certainly; he is ignorant of Chinese and has no idea what the story was about. It wasn't the book, \n15 which is just, well, a book, sitting inertly on the writing desk amid piles of paper. \nSo where did the understanding occur? Searle's answer  is that no understanding did occur; it was just a bunch of mindless page flipping and pencil scratching. And \nnow the bait-and-switch:  the Chinese Room is exactly analogous to a digital computer. The person is the CPU, mindlessly executing instructions, the book is \nthe software program feeding instructions to the CPU, and the scratch paper is the memory. Thus, no matter how cleverly a  computer is designed to simulate \nintelligence by producing the same behavior as a human, it has no understanding and it is not intelligent. (Searle made it clear he didn't know what intelligence is; \nhe was only saying that whatever it is, computers don't have it.)<p>This argument created a huge row among philosophers and AI pundits. It spawned hundreds of articles, plus more than a little vitriol and bad blood. AI defenders \ncame up  with dozens of counterarguments to Searle, such as claiming that although none of the room's component parts understood Chinese, the entire room as a whole did, or that the person in the room really did understand Chinese, but \njust didn't know it. As for me, I think Searle had it right. When I thought through the Chinese Room argument and when I thought about how computers worked, I didn't see  understanding happening anywhere. I was convinced we needed to understand what ""understanding"" is, a way to define it that would make it clear when a system was intelligent and when  it wasn't, when it understands Chinese \nand when it doesn't. Its behavior doesn't tell us this.<p>A human doesn't need to ""do"" anything to understand a story. I can read a story quietly, and although I have no overt behavior my understanding and comprehension are clear, at least to me. You, on the other hand, cannot tell from \nmy quiet behavior whether I understand the story or not, or even if I know the language the story is written in. You might later ask me questions to see if I did, \nbut my understanding occurred when I read the story, not just when I answer your questions. A thesis of this book is that understanding cannot be measured by external behavior; as we'll see in the coming chapters, it is instead an internal metric of how the brain remembers things and uses its memories to make predictions. The Chinese Room, Deep Blue, and most computer programs don't have anything akin to this. They don't understand what they are doing. The only  way we can judge whether a computer is intelligent is by its output, or behavior.",1355596572

That's just as many bits as any later stage.<p>What you really mean is that the initial state is easily compressible.

When I look at the positive role that non-profit foundations have had in developing essential tools for accessing computers and the web (i.e. Wikimedia Foundation: information, the Ubuntu Foundation: operating system, Mozilla Foundation, browser), I can't help but believe that a foundation or non-profit whose aim is to provide and support a set of social web services like Twitter or Facebook or even Gmail, could be beneficial to the world.<p>Web services cost money and often OSS contributions are not enough to drive user adoption and especially support server systems.

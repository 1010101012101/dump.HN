To truly do something different and innovative you need a benevolent dictator that can put down their feet and say ""I don't care what you think, we're doing this and it's going to be great"".<p>You need both the political power within the company to get things done and have the visionary skills to know what needs to be done. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates both obviously has/had this to some degree and could coax, bully and motivate people to see their way.

If you think of their operations as perfect, godlike, or seamless, you have no chance of really understanding them or replicating the good parts yourself.<p>A completely agree, so I think you may have missed my point.<p>It's worth noting that I think Intelligent Design is horseshit, so god leaps neither from that argument nor from Apple for me. For reference, here's the background:<p>Flagellar motor (real):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum#Evolution_of_flagella_and_debate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum#Evolution_of_flagella...</a><p>Irreducible complexity (horseshit):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_complexity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_complexity</a><p>Apple, of course, <i>did</i> evolve from a much less complex organism than it is now, but the overall harmony of its successful products is impressive and demonstrably difficult to replicate. The easy route is to ascribe supernatural powers to Apple's success, but of course the history demonstrates methodical system planning, keen insight, hard work, a bit of fanaticism, and some good timing.<p>The difference between Apple and other organizations is that while in-fighting and conflicting agendas may exist (as in any human system) this doesn't seem to get in the way of a coherent user product. Compare that with Sony, which can't muster a coherent consumer strategy to save its life. (Well, absent saddling every last product with the proprietary storage device du jour.) Apple may itself not be seamless but the overall experience for <i>users of Apple products</i> is shockingly so, especially when compared to competing gear.<p>What internal back biting can you share from your tenure at Apple, though? It would be interesting to learn just how aggressively leadership must filter and otherwise confine these impulses to end up with the focus, profits and product mix we see today.",1287456638

1806003,comment,1805075,1805938,0,0,msbarnett,,," HTML/CSS/JS don't solve the problem at all. As they are used today, they target a small set of viewers which happen to go out of their way to provide a fundamentally similar presentation on different platforms. If the viewer happens to deviate from how the most commonly used viewers render, they tend to break horribly (see, for instance, a heavy javascript site viewed via lynx). It's easy to do ""write once, view on most viewers"" when most viewers try to act more-or-less the same and freely break underlying OS conventions because users have learned to expect that web sites will look and behave the same regardless of the underlying OS conventions.<p>On the other hand, when you're natively targeting several platforms with radically different UI conventions outside of the browser, it's a lot harder to provide a single language and library set that can cover up those differences. You could go for the browser strategy and attempt to convince users that your application is exempt from the underlying OS conventions because it's <i>special</i>, but that's a steep uphill climb (especially with users bases known to be hostile to applications which deviate from expected conventions, like the Apple community; god help you if you're trying to sell an Adobe Air app on OS X).<p>Like I said, there is no silver bullet here. You can't get polished interfaces on multi-platforms if you're not willing to polish your interface separately for each platform.",1287456438

MS Office still sets the bar for office apps (and no, OOo still suffers from missing out on basic functionality).  Visual Studio is light years ahead of the competition.  Windows 7 is really, really slick.  And Windows Phone 7 looks nice.  It's not a clone, they seemed to actually push forward with their Metro interface style.

1805900,comment,1805729,1805767,0,0,spoondan,,,"The feature isn't bad, but there are several warts. The '$' is not a prefix operator on strings. The following is a syntax error:<p><pre><code>    $""test"";
</code></pre>
It turns out that '$' can only operate on an identifier or another '$' expression. The '${...}' syntax, aside from  being more readable and less likely to be accidentally encountered, is more like an operator:<p><pre><code>    ${""test""}; // equivalent to $test
</code></pre>
The decision to keep (and only warn against) unescaped strings past the introduction of an incompatible feature (constants) is inexcusable. It creates oddities:<p><pre><code>    $test = 'foo';
    $foo = 42;
    echo $test . "" ${test} "" . ${test} . "" "" . $$test . ""\n"";
</code></pre>
This generates a notice and prints, ""foo foo foo 42"". But then:<p><pre><code>    $test = 'foo';
    $foo = 42;
    define('test', 'foo');
    echo $test . "" ${test} "" . ${test} . "" "" . $$test . ""\n"";
</code></pre>
This will print, ""foo foo 42 42"". (Note also the difference between the meaning of ${...} within string interpolation versus outside of it.) Is this all understandable? Sure. Is it good? No.",1287453950

Considering Microsoft's consolidated operating income in 2010 was $24 billion, this $679 million only accounts for about 3% of Microsoft's profits. And in any event the Xbox 360, the PS3, and the Wii may be irrelevant given the emergence of connected televisions, thin devices, and cloud-based gaming.<p>b) I am moderately pessimistic about Microsoft's prospects with its Windows Phone 7 OS. There are definitely some promising signs, such as WP7’s distinctive and innovative user interface and Microsoft’s extensive partnerships with smartphone OEMs, application developers, and carriers. But there are also some definite warning signs: WP7 isn’t market ready, and it’s already mid-October; Microsoft is making it difficult for developers to convert existing iOS and Android applications over to WP7; Microsoft’s brand is weak with consumers and the developer community, especially in the smartphone market; and WP7 comes with a price tag, while the competition is free, at least on a variable cost basis. There’s also the fundamental issue of competition, which includes several ambitious and innovative companies, especially Google and Apple, that have established platforms and abundant application markets. Here are some more thoughts on WP7: <a href=""http://www.fernstrategy.com/2010/10/13/the-windows-phone-7-challenge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fernstrategy.com/2010/10/13/the-windows-phone-7-c...</a>.<p>c) Bing has made some inroads in search, but laregely at the expense of Yahoo. For the year, I don't believe Bing has gained at all on Google. There are powerful network effects and learning curves in search, and tremendous scale economies. It will be very difficult for Bing to grow its share in search, much less overtake Google, unless Bing releases a game changing protectable innovation, or Google makes some kind of fatal mistake.",1287453711

Execution is EVERYTHING!  This is SPARTA!!!!""  I just want practical advice on what to do.  Not worrying about it and pushing forward regardless is one option which I'm giving strong consideration to.  But I'd also like to know what sort of legal and other options I can pursue, if I ought to be making any preparations, etc.<p>You know, when you start renting a place, it's always a good idea to take photographs of it in case there's a dispute later over the condition of the property.

I have looked at the yachting industry, and they basically do things the same way they have done them for 100 years. Lots of room for small nimble players. There are probably many industries like that.<p>Maybe it's worth stepping outside the world of high-tech and applying some of the ideas, methods and innovation from this area to other products.",1208714071

I'd respond by saying that not all ideas are equally cheap (some have only been made possible thanks to years of accumulated wisdom), nor are they all equally likely to have been thought up or worked on by someone else.  As a matter of probability, what you say is undoubtedly true, and it's the same response I'd give to most people.  Knowing all this, I still believe my situation to be a possible exception.<p>Let me put this another way: if you don't buy that I'm in an exceptional situation, then let's discuss the matter hypothetically.

[I hate stuff like that. ;)]<p>If you want to date a girl, you could just approach one after another until one finally says yes (e.g., ""My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.""). Or you could improve yourself by learning how to cook or play music, getting in shape, etc., so you have something to actually bring to a relationship. At that point you'll either be turning them away, or you'll have a life and won't care (which can also be an attractor).<p>Same approach in the technical world. Do you have a blog? Or do you participate in open source projects, or attend conferences, or anything else to demonstrate how you bring value to others?<p>Another common path is consulting, which basically accomplishes the same thing. Prove your worth to others, and your goal of introducing a new product becomes much easier.<p>I think sometimes we may care so much about the end product that we have trouble switching from the techie role to the business role.

Make it so good people want to tell others about it. It can't be an ""hmm, yeah I guess that might be useful later. I'll bookmark it"". It has to be a ""Woahhhhh I've been looking for this exact thing for years. So have my friends I bet. I need to use this now, and tell my friends what I found"". (A hard ask, but it's nice to aim for that 'wow' factor).<p>2. Make the base product free, and politely refuse donations. Ask people to simply tell their friends about it. I think people kinda feel guilty about having a cool product for free, so they become evangelists for it, and help you sell it.<p>Having said that, it's good to get something to start off. Look at websites/domains that are related, and have been neglected... Send emails, make an offer, buy domain, get traffic. It's not a sure fire thing - some people still believe domain names to be worth millions whatever they are. But you can pick up some real gems.

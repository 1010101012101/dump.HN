17266,comment,17112,17262,0,0,jey,,,"I use almost all free software. I do all of my work under the MacOS unix environment with vim, gcc, python, etc etc. You can use the MacPorts ( <a href=""http://www.macports.org"">http://www.macports.org</a> ) package manager to install and manage your usual unix utilities. (MacPorts is analogous to portage/emerge on Gentoo, apt-get on Debian, yum on RedHat/Fedora, and FreeBSD's ports). I also use Firefox for web and Adium X for IM.<p>The only thing I can recall paying for is Parallels, a virtualizer similar to VMWare, to run MS Windows under MacOS. I hardly ever use it.",1177638374

After few months it increased by 100 bucks.<p>Today he is making over $600/month and increasing. Obviously not to take anything away from him(he was a fine designer!)--the power in the Indian job market in last three years has shifted from employers to employees.<p>",1177636364

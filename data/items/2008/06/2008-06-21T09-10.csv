Long story short: where is a power law there is also a long tail. Using the long tail in a smart way has many advantages. Most of them revolve around greater diversity, which can be surprising in a power law environment where we're used to see only concentration.
Eg: few movies are blockbusters, and many are not. Instead of watching only the blockbusters you can invest effort in ""mining"" the movie long tail for something that matches your tastes very closely.
Some interesting aplications in social sciences.",1214040975

I find the former to be much less realistic than the latter but we are probably looking at different data sets.",1214040487
223595,comment,222157,222237,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"1. So do many other ""cv jobs"", but they don't take more then a decade to do it.
2. Like in any other job.
3. True. But automatic promotion doesn't make one proud.
4. Here it's the biggest difference. As an entrepreneur you're training in being able to know what needs to be done. This teaches you the opposite: everything is equally important just because you're told so
5. Not really. In any other job you have at least a few hours of independence. Not in this one.
6. True
7. Not really, at least not he open-desk seating part.
8. Ha ha. Creativity... really. 
9. All work = useless work. No work is ever used except for evaluation purposes. Ever. Ever. God, i'm depressed already.
10. Could be, haven't been employed in the field for a while.
11. true
12. true
13. Most people have exactly the same in their resume, so its real value is nil.<p>I'd like to elaborate a bit on the creativity part. Most school is a lot like an assembly line - the cheapest way to teach thousands of children necessary things. This is not bad, time and money constraints are real. But in this framework you can't afford to encourage true creativity, simply because to be creative you need: 1. a ""space"" in which to be creative and 2. not to be evaluated by classic means. School environment provides neither.",1214040355

I can come out of here with three heavy bags of groceries that would have cost me an arm and a leg at Safeway.  Their produce is great, the bread selection more than adequate (tons of different flat breads but I don't know what to do with them, so my fault) and their jams and tea collection perfect.  That's the usual stuff I hit.   Oh wait, chocolate, they've got chocolate!  They really have quite a variety of nice items that I'm not remembering to mention right now.""",1214039956

""I love this family owned Produce market.  The vegetables & fruit are always seasonal and fresh. The prices are ridiculously cheap you almost feel like your steeling.""<p>....<p>So long, Sucky's!<p>Hellooooooo hella cheap produce.<p>""Not always the freshest, and not quite the liveliness of a legit outdoor Farmer's Market, but for the convenient location AND all the money I'm saving, do I even really care?""<p>And, I now several other small grocery stores, just as cheap.<p>Go to lucky's, or safeway, and you are paying almost twice for the same stuff.
Guys you have to digg around for the good stuff.  If you live something like Marina, or Fidi, or Soma, you probably don't have choice but big stores, but if you live in the Inner Richmond, China Town, Mission, there are plenty of family run cheap grocery store.",1214039579

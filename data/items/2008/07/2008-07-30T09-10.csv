I no longer play mmos as a result.",1217410698

261661,comment,260017,261420,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Free speech as a policy has consistently been interpreted as political speech, that is, speech about what or what not we should be doing. It this sense of speech as a voice of opposition calling for change in the status quo that I meant.<p>Sorry to make so many jumps, but it wouldn't have occurred to me to use the term in any other way -- obviously I'm not talking about speech one does not have to pay for. Or speech that is unconstrained.<p>There's a fine difference between honestly describing what you believe to be the other person's views, exaggerating the other person's views in order to show how his/her argument fails at the extremes, and purposely mis-stating the other person's views simply to mock them without giving them a fair chance at explanation.<p>We do all three of these all of the time in normal arguments, btw.<p>I just couldn't equate the blog to the TV channel reference. I'm not going to defend Fox News, mainly because I don't think they need defending. I'm unaware of anything that seems ""wrong"" about them, save for the fact they seem to bug the heck out of more progressive people. But it seemed like two different genres, and two completely different animals.<p>There's an interesting question in there about blogs in general, and the tendency in media for consumers to prefer people who rant and rave, as I notice many of the later evening cable news entertainment shows doing. (Note the separation of news, news commentary, and news entertainment) I wonder why this type of ""corrosive"" media attracts so many viewers? Is there a large group of people, for instance, that really want to hear YC misrepresented and trashed? I don't believe that. I believe the article in question only exaggerated a bit to show where the site could be headed. If not, there's nothing stopping us from using his piece for that purpose.<p>It just always raises my hairs when somebody says something to the effect of ""stop that man! He's saying something dangerous!"" or the like. I'm just curious. EDIT: Paul did not use the word ""dangerous."" he only implied that this article was in some different category of bad speech beyond LOLCats.",1217410211

However, in practice, it's just a part of the fragmented web world we live in right now.<p>Communities of people spring up all over the place, and a problem we have today is sometimes you do just want to get something everywhere, without posting multiple times. I might have a community on Twitter, Flickr, Xanga and Blogger... today I have to log in and post something 4 times. Or, post once by email from my posterous.<p>I think that's valuable, at least for me. But judging from our feedback from our users so far, they agree too. And as a startup, that's what counts.",1217409582

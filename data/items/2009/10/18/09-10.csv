His way of doing things works for him. Is using a site that just shows the youtube video in question minimal? Would using darkroom instead of textmate be more minimal? Would using a 386 instead of a Mac be more minimal? Would using vi be more minimal?<p>I'm not having a pop at the guy, he's made a choice and it works for him. From where I sit (typing this on Vista/Firefox but also using Arch/Awesome elsewhere) it seems some of his choices (to me at least) seem a bit more ocd than minimal.<p>But I'm glad he has something that works for him and it's always good to see other people's setups.",1255859695

Like the article says, most of this isn't hard to figure out.  Did you have to hire an SEO expert to get your biology page built?<p>Also, marketing is about much more than just 'selling stuff'.

888205,comment,887743,888188,0,0,patio11,,,"That depends entirely on what you're doing.  If you're competing for #1 on [credit cards], yep, its a zero-sum game and most people will lose.  SEO is about so much more than just winning on one term, though.  (Do we say marketing is a zero-sum game because There Can Be Only One, e.g., pizza shop for any given delivery?)<p>Concrete examples:<p>1)  Over 25% of searches are globally unique, and the results for these are often suboptimal.  (Google has a very good handle on what [credit cards] there are, but does not necessarily know a [good class activity for Halloween].)  Proper SEO for your site to target those things is mostly just about getting links and writing your onpage content better, and creates value for the searcher.<p>2)  Content creation is a core SEO strategy and is a source of new wealth.<p>This was the #1 page for [biology bingo] three years ago:<p><a href=""http://www.biologycorner.com/worksheets/blankbingo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biologycorner.com/worksheets/blankbingo.html</a><p>(Its a blank bingo template which says ""biology"" on it.

You suddenly have A LOT more 'shares' being sold, without a corresponding increase in buyers.<p>As such, the share price declines. Couple this with nasty rumors, and the declining share price doesn't entice any new buyers (which is normally the case when something gets cheap). As the price caves further, and the rumors persist, existing owners start to worry, and decide to get out before it gets worse. Now the downward spiral is in full force.

888199,comment,887490,887616,0,0,mapleoin,,,"I mainly use Fedora because their community is targeted at contributors rather than users. I switched to Fedora so I could contribute to their infrastructure team and get to play with all their webapps. In Fedora you can become anything you want. You can play with all of the servers, the build servers, updates, wiki, blogs, planet etc. given you've proven yourself.<p>I've recently begun contributing packages as well. The processes are a lot more complex than Arch for example, but it's all very documented and sane once you get over the steep learning curve. Packages get through a lot more filters before they get accepted and there's also the ""send all patches upstream"" mantra which makes Fedora special because we are contributing to other distros as well this way :)",1255858111

But a growing body of evidence indicates that skilled foreign immigrants create jobs for Americans and boost our national competitiveness.</i><p>That's a bit of bait-and-switch. The concern shared by 86% of Americans is over illegal immigrants that take low-skill jobs away from Americans (particularly black Americans in the cities, where this is a huge and underreported issue), commit crimes at a disproportionate rate, and consume social services to the point that a number of US hospitals have had to close down due to non-paying illegals.<p>In the third sentence it's suddenly about ""skilled"" legal foreign workers, which is rarely the focus of the ""xenophobes"" (nice ad hominem!) These are two entirely different issues.<p>I should add that I'm married to a Chinese woman with an MD and an MS degree.

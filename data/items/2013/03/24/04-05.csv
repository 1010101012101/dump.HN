It was not funded initially because my PI's funding was running out in a year. <angry bold>I was applying for funds to continue my education so my PI wouldn't have to pay me (so we could use that money for my research), but they wouldn't fund me because my PI was running out of funds...to fund me. </><p>I resubmitted the exact same grant, with zero changes, but I included a letter staying that I'd be covered if my PI ran out of money.

It is therefore a pretty good example of some of Microsoft's lower level anticompetitive acts, but it's a poor example of ""embrace, extend, and extinguish"" (even if only for the fact that NPAPI was itself essentially being made up as Netscape went along at the time).<p>No, the canonical examples of the phrase, coming from US v Microsoft itself, refers to Microsoft's attempts to make Sun and Netscape irrelevant when it came to Java and the web, respectively. The plan was to embrace the standards of each, bringing support in as core OS features, and then literally extending the standards with new APIs, tags, etc to add features that developers would want. This would put pressure on those companies that in time they might not be able to keep up with (or they would spend all their time reimplementing Microsoft's features and lose their images as the trailblazers) because the formerly-standardized content they used to be able to consume with their programs would become unreadable and/or unrunnable without the extensions. What's worse, Microsoft often designed APIs that were closely aligned with Windows APIs, specifically to make it easy to implement there, and difficult to implement efficiently elsewhere.<p>In other words, they <i>broke</i> the standards in a way that if you didn't implement the extensions, you couldn't consume the content that was supposedly compliant with that standard. You aren't adding a feature that users want and so other clients need to compete, you're adding features to the content standard so that other clients <i>cannot function</i> without them, and you're doing it while pretending loudly that your extension is just part of the standard.<p>So, no, a service that makes the <i>client</i> better and that users soon demand does not fit the bill (and, again, we're talking about an API specifically existing for making it easier to interoperate on those features). Yes, it had a market impact in that many users wanted support in any feed reader, and, now going away, there will be a loss of functionality if someone doesn't reimplement it. That's often the way with features. But it's a poor analog for the actions of monopolists past.",1364098260

The grants are scored by peer professors, based on publications (which again requires approval by peers).  This creates a bunch of problems 1) it's very easy for entire field or subfield to go down the wrong track, and have no way of getting out of that track because the professors controlling grants and publications are the ones doing the bad research. 2) there is a bias towards publishing research that shows some new finding, rather than research that shows that they could not re-produce some previous science.  The entire idea of basing science off of peer review is erroneous IMO, science should advance via replication.<p>In my ideal world, research would be funded in three, independent streams:\n1) Prize based.  The government would allocate a yearly budget of some very large amount of money - say $30 billion.  It would create competitions and prizes in all sorts of fields.  Example contests might include: self-driving car race, robot soccer olympics, longest battery life for $x of total materials used for making the battery,  most yield of a plant strain per acre, etc.  Teams would receive money for their research in return for placing or winning the contests.  Research teams would also get money for achieving objective milestones:<p>2) Commission based.  The government needs some new technology, maybe an upgrade of stealth tech for their fighter planes, so it pays a research institute to develop that tech.  Unlink grant based funding, the commission is granted by the outsiders who need the tech, not by professors in the field giving to it to fellow professors.<p>3) Open Ended Institutional Funding.  A certain number of reputable institutions should simply be given permanent annual funding.  No grant process, no paperwork, no bureaucracy.  The researchers would be overseen by an executive director, and the executive director would be overseen by a board of directors.  The board of directors would consist of outside experts with a proven track record.  For example, the board of a computer science research university would have people like Google's Urs Hlzle or Guido or Trevor Blackwell.  The researchers would not have to apply for grants.  They would just have to convince the board of directors that they were generally working on projects that had potential benefit to humanity, or else they would get fired.  Every institution would be actually independent, governed by the personal judgement of that institutions board of directors.",1364098020

When you put that into a logical context, it's comically absurd. Where do those talking heads think the money to consume comes from? 100% of it comes from production or credit, with the ability to spend being a left-over fractional fruit of production (aka the profit from producing something).",1364097955

In other words, it has a precise, limited meaning and is not a fancy term for ""just wanting to charge rent in general"".<p>AP going to court to enforce existing laws protecting new work is pretty much the opposite of rent seeking behavior in that (a) they're spending resources to operate within the existing regulatory framework, not petitioning to alter it in their favor and (b) they're doing so in conjunction with the production of new (and presumably) economically valuable work.",1364097653

Do note that Reddit also has down votes and Reddit also has threaded comments. While I agree, it's not the ""perfect"" solution, but for a perfect solution HN admins would need to invest a lot of time (and it would probably be a lot more buggy and in the end they probably won't come up with something that's better). Going with Wilson they can do a quick fix that would improve the sorting a lot.",1364097625

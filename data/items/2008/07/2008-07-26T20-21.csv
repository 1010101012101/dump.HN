Wouldn't your interaction be some kind of training for effective communication? Assuming again that said student is excellent, you would expect them to pick up the language in about a year, and wouldn't expect they become a hindrance during, would you?",1217104835

There might be a lower out casting of nerds if the popularity gap is smaller.

257747,story,,,2,1,niels_olson,"Are publicly readable access lists secure?",,"The scenario I'm thinking of is actually low tech, but I suppose the answer would be general. Let me explain the problem by way of example:<p>The university campus uses access lists signed by faculty to allow after-hours access to various office spaces, and security simply authenticates the student by comparing the human in front of them to the name and picture on the photo ID. The downside, which I just encountered, is that the access list letters may become outdated and so, in my case, I had to call the director of the lab and ask her to call security (naturally they didn't authenticate the caller :-D)<p>I was wondering, is it secure for, say, the chair of the physics department to submit a signed access list letter that simply points the security department to a URL on the physics department's website?<p>More generally, let's say there's a system where access is tied to an authentication system. If the authentication system involves a 1:1 token (like a photo ID or a password), and the access list is only writable by trusted members who are trusted through an entirely different mechanism (like the university's LDAP or physical access to a machine), is there any reason the access list itself can't be publicly readable (eg, posted on the website)?<p>So, in the case of the student trying to get into the lab on the weekend, is there any reason the department chair's access list letter couldn't read like this:<p>============================<p>From: Dr Heavy Duty, Chairman, Department of Physics<p>To: Lieutenant Cranky, Security<p>Subj: Access List for locked office spaces<p>please refer to the following URL for a continuously updated list of people I authorize access:<<p>http://university.edu/Physics/AccessList<p>Signed /H Duty/<p>============================<p>I suppose there's a corner case where you don't want to allow physical access to the webserver based on an authentication list kept on the webserver, but even then, short of cold boot dumping memory, the server itself is pretty good at controlling access.<p>Thoughts?",1217103617

This is even true if the immigration is a net-benefit to both natives and newcomers.<p>With that in mind, the massive downvoting of the parent comment (at -9 at one point) is a dishonest enforcement of political correctness.<p>Even if you disagree with the <i>conclusions</i> of the linked article, and the <i>other views</i> of that article's author, the comment here is factual and relevant to the topic at hand, and the linked article includes other useful facts about Finland.<p>If the submission question ""What makes Finnish kids so smart?"" is legitimate at all -- the study of why one country has different results than others --  discussion has to be free to consider major things that make that country different from others.

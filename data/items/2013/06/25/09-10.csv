He essentially said &quot;ugh, philosophy, what a load of crap&quot; without providing much in the way of specifics, except a vague mention that he doesn&#x27;t like Hegel (who he may or may not have read, and is hardly a great place to start in any case). What he hasn&#x27;t done is provide a clear, well-thought out contrary point of view, just an off-hand criticism.<p>In general, I don&#x27;t find sweeping &quot;ugh, this is crap&quot; pronouncements without detail or analysis to be too useful, especially at the level of granularity of people dismissing entire other fields of study which are not their own. As you yourself argue in this thread, mere criticism isn&#x27;t particularly constructive.<p>Curiously, he does cite a philosopher in his list of books you should read (Kuhn). It&#x27;s one of Kuhn&#x27;s more historically oriented books, but still leans towards philosophy of science. If you like that one, you might also like some of Kuhn&#x27;s more philosophically oriented books, like <i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>.",1372153931

He has an AB from Cornell and a PhD in Computer Science from Harvard, and studied painting at RISD and the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence.</i><p><i>What I learned from trying to study philosophy is that the place to look is in other fields. If you understand math or history or aeronautical engineering very well, the most abstract of the things you know are what philosophy is supposed to be teaching.</i><p>It depends what type of Philosophy you&#x27;re studying. Formal Logic: I can see the argument that with a strong Mathematical background & CS, you&#x27;ve already learned (most) of the tricks (although, this largely misses the point that most of the great Mathematicians of the 20th C also dabbled in the Philosophy of Logic - famously Gdel etc).<p>The <i>other</i> kind of Philosophy inhabits the same mental space as Art (ahhh, Florence!). This is a common issue with American Nationals, as American (and to some degree, British) philosophy is mired in Behaviorism, Philosophy of the Mind (which does make me cry a little inside when they don&#x27;t keep up with neuroscience or even know anything about Complex Systems Theory) and other schools.<p>Ethics and Morality? Reaching those Creative spaces of the Sublime and so forth? Aesthetics? All fields I assumed the author would be interested in, given his Artistic leanings, and all fields that Philosophy is very useful to read on.<p>And, as a friendly note: I&#x27;m not sure <i>aeronautical engineering</i> can teach you much on that, barring of course: if you build it wrong, Death is <i>certainly</i> going to be the Horizon you hit.",1372151110
5938282,comment,5920921,5935024,1,0,homeomorphic,,,"> Funny that you call the packaging scheme the &quot;classical model&quot; - to me that&#x27;s the &quot;[relatively] new and weird&quot; scheme. I&#x27;d say that &quot;everybody builds their own binaries&quot; is the classical model.<p>I stand corrected.<p>> In my life, it never comes up. I am either using a personal machine or managing a server which is responsible for one single service.<p>I just went back through my own update log a couple of months: You don&#x27;t use anything that uses libxml [1], ffmpeg (audio/video Swiss army knife) [2], poppler (popular PDF library) [3] or openSSL [4]? Do you pay attention to the security notices of every program you have that bundled one of those? Are you sure that upstream is paying attention to the security ntoices of those libraries?<p>> The idea that upgrading one library could affect the behavior of hundreds of programs is terrifying. How do I know they all still work? I don&#x27;t. I have to go test them all. What this means is that I never update any libraries at all, on a linux machine, because I can&#x27;t know in advance what the upgrade might break.<p>For non-rolling distributions (for example Debian stable, Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat) packages <i>don&#x27;t have their behavior changed throughout the lifetime of a release</i> <6>. Security and bug fixes are <i>backported</i> to whatever version is in place for the lifespan of the distribution&#x27;s release. This is part of the point of stable releases, and something that&#x27;s routinely forgotten by those who hound package maintainers for newer versions of things!<p>As an example, let&#x27;s consider [1]. Ubuntu 13.04 uses libxml2 version 2.9.0 plus some Debian/Ubuntu patches. They released version 2.9.0+dfsg1-4ubuntu4.1 with the following changelog [5]:<p><pre><code>  * SECURITY UPDATE: multiple use after free issues\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2013-1969.patch: properly reset pointers in\n      HTMLparser.c, parser.c.\n    - CVE-2013-1969\n</code></pre>\nOnly the security fix is applied, and after upgrade you know that libxml2 will continue as it has done for the lifetime of your distro release, except it&#x27;s no longer vulnerable to CVE-2013-1969. Moreover, this applies to every program using libxml (i.e. a lot) with one update. Again: There&#x27;s no other change in behavior for libxml!<p>> This is exactly what I get on Mac OS X, and it&#x27;s what I get when I build apps with statically linked libraries on Linux: stuff works until I break it, and then I know what I broke, so I can fix it.<p>Stuff <i>seems</i> to work until you break it. Then a security hole is found, and it turns out things aren&#x27;t really working very well at all. To me it seems like a lot of work to keep track of such things by yourself!<p>[1] <a href=""http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1969</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2496"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2496</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1790"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1790</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0169"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0169</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxml2/2.9.0+dfsg1-4ubuntu4.1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxml2/2.9.0+dfsg1-4ub...</a><p><6> Firefox and a few other packages, mostly web browsers who are making it hard to provide security backports, are notable exceptions.",1372151104

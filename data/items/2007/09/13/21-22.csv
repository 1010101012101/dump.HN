A method for a computer system to use human assistance in performing tasks, the method comprising: automatically and under control of a first computer system, causing a task to be performed by, identifying a first and a second subtask of the task, wherein the first subtask involves speech recognition; retrieving information about past quality of results of one or more humans when previously performing subtasks other than the first subtask; using the retrieved past quality information to facilitate performance of the first subtask by one or more humans, the facilitating of the performance of the first subtask including, identifying one or more required capabilities for performance of the first subtask; dispatching the first subtask to a remote second computer system of a first human for performance by the first human, the first human identified as being one of one or more humans who have capabilities that satisfy the required capabilities for the first subtask, the retrieved past quality information including past quality information for the first human when previously performing multiple subtasks other than the first subtask, the past quality information for the first human being at least part of the capabilities of the first human that satisfy the required capabilities for the first subtask; and receiving a first result from the first human via the second computer system, the first result generated by performance of the first subtask by the first human; providing payment to the first human for the performance of the first subtask; and generating a result for the task based at least in part on the first result.

I find there are two people that ask the question.<p>1) The jealous/conformist. They are asking you why you are not participating in the rest of the system as they understand it. A polite smile (as you would give an idiot or child) and a ""So far things are going really well. I find I don't really need a regular job"" works, because it lets them feel like they know what a ""regular"" job is an reinforces their value system. It also makes them even more jealous, and that's a nice benefit.<p>2) People who just don't understand. My mom and stepdad fall into this category. They don't mean anything -- they simply have no concept of how a person could exist without working for some other organization. I've been working on my parents for the entire 20 years, to little effect. With these people, just be patient. An 80-year-old without a computer is not going to understand Web 2.0 no matter what. So it's not like even if you had a ""job"" they would even understand then. To them, you'll probably always be sitting around playing pong or watching Star Trek TOS and having money for some strange reason.",1189717465

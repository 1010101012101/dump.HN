For example, it didn't, and still doesn't, allow you to configure your page with auto-playing music, videos, custom backgrounds and fonts, and lots of animated GIFs.

A year later, we were typing away at some cafe, and his screen turned white and the machine let out a long constant beep. We tried restarting, clearing various types of RAMs, etc, nothing worked. We took it in to the Apple store and they told us something had randomly given out, and that it could've been some sort of manufacturer's defect. The repair costs would've have added up to something around $800, but because of AppleCare, there was no charge. It was definitely worth it in that case.<p>Edit: Reading arihant's comment, I now remember that it was his logic board that gave out.",1272765110

1311716,comment,1311391,1311424,0,0,codexon,,,"Another interesting question would be: how will it make money?<p>Websites like Facebook and Myspace are shunning the simple advertisement model. Selling private data will become the new standard. A website similar to scope and feature like Facebook will probably not be able to sustain a positive cash flow or break even without selling people's data. UNLESS...they cut features like photo storage, or make a technological breakthrough.<p>They are making ~$2/user/year (not including expenses). Since it recently supposedly became cash-flow positive, it would be reasonable to assume that the expenses are also around ~$2/user.<p>The question then becomes, how much of this $2 is slashed off when you decide to not sell private data? You only have to look at the cost of conventional CPM ads (usually less than $0.01 per impression) and multiply it by how many times a Facebook user opens Facebook each year. My bet is that it is far less than 365/2 since Facebook claims 50% of ""active"" users login every day.",1272764679

If you aren't aware of it, you're already succeeding, because you haven't defined it otherwise.<p>Personally, I wish to stay happy moment-to-moment. I want to be 100% engaged in any thing that I do, even in the most mundane of tasks like putting on clothes, eating, shaving. I don't want my mind to leap ahead to fantasies of the next thing, as it doesn't improve my future enjoyment, and it rarely gives me any useful insight. And I don't want to burden myself with abstract thoughts of ""is my life as good as it could be?"" as that leads me to beat myself up for no reason.<p>This does not conflict at all with the more material goals in life; rather, it puts them into proper perspective.",1254337107

That's why things like sIFR exist.<p>What is the point?  I completely disagree that this is pretty cool.  This sucks (compared to other solutions, including not doing it at all.)  It is the ultimate triumph of form over function.  It is like something someone would have suggested in 2001.  If you want something cool, check out modern solutions to this problem like Cufon, which generates fonts that can be rendered as real text with Javascript.<p>That, or, you know, let the user decide how he wants to read your text instead of trying to control every last pixel on his screen.",1254334069

2151053,comment,2150592,2150592,0,0,jhamburger,,,"It seems that we might look back in history and see the rise and fall of Japan in a single generation.  Culturally, founder CEOs are given the utmost respect, while hired CEOs are looked at almost as figureheads.  By the time Japan really started to decline in the 90s, most of the entrepreneurs who rebuilt industry after the war were gone- leaving their companies rudderless.  The political sphere is even worse, corruption and cronyism abound.  Japan, the unstoppable juggernaut, is now ruled by old men lining their pockets.<p>Surely there are lessons to be learned here.",1296197832

I have zero faith it'll work the same way in both versions).  I have heard a <i>lot</i> is better in 2010, but in general it's still a Microsoft product; huge, inconsistent, and so tightly bound into everything that they have no proper competition.<p>Oddly, Intellisense is generally keeping up with me, despite the site being at <i>least</i> a few hundred thousand lines of code (light on the abstraction, though, so it's <i>mostly</i> flat .NET code.  Probably not too taxing on intellisense).  There are times I just break out Notepad++ and finish up stuff VS was breaking, but it generally catches up any time I build the relevant projects.<p>And I should be clearer, because it's so weird: the designer-view was actually instantiating the entire window control, as it's init contained the database connecting code, and firing events on the combo box controls that queried the database.  At no point was the database actually <i>connected</i> to VS, which you can do; and I'll never even consider trying it, after seeing that happen.",1296197789

From a PR point of view, it can be used in one of two ways; if you want to get in touch with a journalist about a story or your client, but you aren’t sure if they’ll be interested, you can search for that journalist and look at the articles they’ve worked on in the past. If you want to get in touch about something to do with science, but the contact has only written about politics in the past, it’s probably best to forget contacting them. Similarly, if there’s a subject matter you have in mind and you want to look up journalists who write about it, you can use journalisted.com for that too.""<p>Thought I'd mention it in case it hadn't been done in the US or AU and someone was interested in trying it.",1296197565

What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?</i>",1182689847

Everyone, from the boss on down, got their 15 minutes, so it was spread out evenly.  Fatty/sugary glop is of more (short term) ""benefit"" to those who consume more of it.  In that case I'd rather just keep the money to spend as I want.  Also, a massage isn't something I probably would have gone to the trouble of signing up for, at least for 15 minutes, so that made it sort of a pleasant 'extra'.  Also, the rates were probably a bit lower, because the woman had a whole day's worth of work.",1182687326

One of the points that came up was how do you know when your uploaded file is ""safe"", i.e. not when the upload has finished but when all N copies exist so you can go back to your user and say ""fear not"".  A simple fetch of it is insufficient;  S3 is selling itself on its redundancy so it needs to prove it.  Anyone know of a way to do this?",1182686441

In reality only regular sleep cycles and adequate exercises can keep you at your peak performance over the long term.  Meditations can help you to control your focus and weed out distractions, so you waste less of your time when the environment doesn't fit you.<p>If you really need to pull a few all-nighters, consider taking something on a measurable dosage, so when you decide to rehabilitate, you can adjust your intake on a decay curve.",1176860586

13911,comment,13775,13775,0,0,blader,,,"Like a lot of others have said here, it depends on where you define your threshold for having ""learned"" a language. To get reasonably productive in a language to the point where you can (eventually) build most things shouldn't take more than week if you have a few under your belt.<p>Then there is the long process learning the right idioms, keeping up with the latest changes in newer languages, familiarizing yourself with the universe of libraries, etc, etc - I think all of these things are required to really claim fluency in a language. So I would answer ""a long, long ass time.""",1176859534

13908,comment,13752,13752,0,0,nickb,,,"VCs want to invest into a C-corp because it allows them to have a flexible share structure so if you're seeking VC money, C-corp will be a must. But, in the mean time, you CAN use S-corp since it is easy to set up and gives you some protections. S-corp can be easily converted into a C-corp (a single supplemental form!). LLC is not as easy to convert to a C-corp and paperwork is fairly complex and will cost you several K.<p>Thing to note about S-corps is that all founders _MUST_ be American citizens.",1176858874

I've seen it from both perspectives. From the lowball bidding most people on such sites do, as a designer I don't really expect a $100 website to take me a month and for me to think about it all day. So if you don't know exactly what you want you'll get some very average work.<p>",1176858837

Yes there are few odd investments here and there but that is vastly different from having deadbeat IPOs of '99 era that were based on pure hype. <p>Closest bubble bursting we might see this time around may be IF adsense/adwords collapse. Even then it will be on a much smaller scale than before. And to be honest, knowing the smart folks behind google, I don't see such a thing happening overnight. At the helm of '99 bubble were young grads and hype filled underwriters; at the helm of the bubble today(if you can even call it a bubble) are a buncha PhDs and a very smart CEO(Eric Schmidt).<p>",1176858458

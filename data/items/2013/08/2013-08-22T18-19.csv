He knows they might think he&#x27;s fasting. Say: I ran out the door and didn&#x27;t have a chance to get breakfast. I&#x27;m pretty hungry.
He knows that they might be suspicious of religiosity. Explain the details of your trip.
Yes he doesn&#x27;t have to and it should have been easier for him, but use some common sense. 
It&#x27;s the same reason that when you&#x27;re pulled over for speeding 5 over you don&#x27;t refuse to answer any questions. You try to be polite and hope the officer will let you off with a warning. The likely outcome is better.",1377197990

6259259,comment,6258188,6259109,12,0,lvs,,,"> The courts don&#x27;t all agree.<p>The one case you cite is very fresh precedent in a single Circuit, and it&#x27;s highly controversial.  No other Federal Circuit has applied First Amendment standards to FDA misbranding regulations before.  Even within the Second Circuit (three states), is it still illegal under law to misbrand a drug in marketing materials.  The decision in Cariona hinges on the question of whether &quot;misbranding&quot; and &quot;promotion of off-label use&quot; are different narrowly defined legal scenarios.  The Second Circuit was concerned that, in the latter scenario, doctors may be legally deterred from promoting off-label use, which is a common practice in medicine and research.  You should not take away from this case that drug marketing is now a First Amendment free-for-all.  Yes, I am awfully certain.",1377197942

Why doesn&#x27;t he have bi-monthly feature reviews? Because he wouldn&#x27;t have as much to contribute as Jobs. He doesn&#x27;t have the product intuition and he knows it.<p>What was unique about Steve Jobs was that he could perform so many different roles within the company. He could convince anyone he needed to join the company, he could ascertain just what kinds of products were likely to be successful, and he could get on stage and sell the living daylights out of the products his company had built. These roles are necessarily going to be performed worse when separated into different executives, just like a basketball player who can play great offense and defense is worth a lot more to a team than ten great offensive players and ten great defensive players.<p>As Bill Gates said, the (old) Apple model only works if you have a Steve Jobs.

When I used to build tools for the electricity trading desk, we were handling market bids/asks and scheduling of the power plants.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of the stuff that we were dealing with.  This is the real time settlement point prices for ERCOT (the grid network in Texas): <a href=""http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/real_time_spp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/real_time_spp</a><p>We had systems that lay out prices that we were willing to turn on and ramp up power plants.

The more current the data you&#x27;re getting, the more expensive it is.  That&#x27;s why the tickers on CNBC or Fox Business are 20 minutes delayed-that data is effectively free at that point.<p>For a HFT algo trading outfit, they&#x27;re looking at buying the fastest, most expensive data, which is real-time full tick.  That means that they&#x27;re going to be getting every single quote and trade for a given instrument from the provider.  I would imagine that the online brokerages are also consuming this data, because that would give them a slight edge with price matching for their clients.<p>For normal day traders or brokers, they&#x27;re probably using a terminal provided by their data provider(i.e. Bloomberg Terminal, Thomson Reuters Eikon, or Thomson One).  Since these are human display apps, there&#x27;s a lot more lag time allowed, typically in the hundreds of milliseconds to low single digit seconds.  Here, the data is often conflated, so multiple quotes are combined to show the last known data state for the instrument.

6258993,comment,6258093,6258093,6,0,bazillion,,,"I can understand the public outrage over what the implications are for things that have been circulated in the press.  The author, however, is guilty of a very terrible error in my opinion -- he has walked the halls of Ft. Meade and seen how the NSA operated, and yet now he believes that the NSA operates 180 degrees from when he joined.  He&#x27;s essentially casting aspersions at those who have joined the NSA since his leaving, and those who still yet join, saying &quot;Shame on you, shame on you for not having a higher moral standard!&quot;.  Well, you sir can politely go fuck yourself.<p>Those who have served in the military or as civilians in the department of defense have given up a lot of their personal liberties in order to provide for the common defense.  Service.  It&#x27;s not a concept I expect you to understand if you&#x27;re reading this from a Starbucks while pitching your new startup idea to your friends.  It entails willingly giving up the ability to talk to your friends and loved ones about <i>anything</i> you do -- you often end up telling people that you do some mundane job because you can&#x27;t answer their followup questions.  It means getting called into work or off of vacation because your small piece of the world has gone to shit, and not having anyone to vent to about it.  It also means placing the very notion of where you live in the hands of the government, and sometimes being forced to be away from your family for years.  It is all these things and more, but it is not <i>ever</i> something one should be made to feel ashamed of doing.<p>There are thousands of employees right now in the NSA who aren&#x27;t even allowed to come to their own defense on the matter, because DoD has deemed that speaking about the situation is a security violation.  They have to sit there and endure that the people around them who are very ignorant as to what it is NSA even does, just plain get it wrong.  Well, as my NSA/CIA security clearance finally closed out yesterday, I have no qualms about speaking on their behalf.<p>The public is completely and utterly wrong about the motivations of the NSA and the information they were provided as &quot;fact&quot;.  Everything has been skewed to paint a picture that is damning and I would definitely be angry about if it were true, but it just isn&#x27;t.  There is a culture of protecting American civil liberties in the NSA.  It&#x27;s almost pathological -- anything that can potentially affect a US person is given extremely wide berth.  There are major auditing and oversight mechanisms in place in case someone were to ever run a query that affected a US person.  So the notion that in 2 years, the intelligent, passionate, and devoted people I came to know have somehow flipped around and violate rights willy-nilly now is a ludicrous idea.  If this were true, we would be seeing a thousand whisteblowers (true whistleblowers, not Snowden) coming out of the woodwork trying to correct the system.<p>It is not true that the government doesn&#x27;t care about the rights of individuals just because you want it to be true.  Those that are employed are individuals too, and are not being magically compelled to carry terrible secrets against their individual moral codes and ethics.  They are carrying out a mission of defense which extends into the technology of this century -- even cars have had 100 years for us to deliberate and come up with the current system of laws that govern that technology.  While the legal framework for their actions are up for debate, their collective character is not.<p>The current public climate surrounding those who have been in the intelligence community hearkens back to days of activists yelling &quot;Baby killer!  Baby killer!&quot; at passing by Vietnam vets.  A few of you who are self-reflecting will at some point in your life when the intelligence practices becomes more public, regret your outrage and overreaction at this time.  I feel like the rest will not, because it was a passing trend and never really affected you directly either way.<p>I would like to thank those that have served (including the author) and continue to serve for their part in upholding their oath.  It may seem like no one gets you, but a few out here in the public sector do.  In the cycle of the public raging against government powers, and then asking why the government didn&#x27;t do more about x situation, the people in service get lost in the mix.<p>I hope that regardless of who you are reading this, that you have the ability to empathize with those who are outside of your personal story, with whom you will never have any interaction with.  That I happen to know some of their faces doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I don&#x27;t assume the faceless ones are perpetrating a great conspiracy against the American people.  I just assume that they&#x27;re serving.",1377195938

However, Mattermark has found that tracking sales support materials (videos, whitepapers, and other documentation) is a signal and makes it easier to view traffic as an exhaust of the sales process.

   Through this method, Mattermark listed cloud hosting startup Digital Ocean as its top pick for a pre-Series A company. The company raised a healthy round a few months later, mainly because of its success with developers.
</code></pre>
This post seems to imply that Mattermark identified Digital Ocean as a promising pre-Series A company before anyone else. This isn&#x27;t the case. Mattermark&#x27;s Digital Ocean &quot;call&quot; was published on June 22, 2013. At the time, Digital Ocean&#x27;s rise was being noted by others based on more meaningful criteria than &quot;sales support materials&quot; (see <a href=""http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/06/13/the-meteoric-rise-of-digitalocean.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/06/13/the-meteoric-ri...</a> for example), and as a 2012 TechStars participant, the company was almost certainly on the radar of investors for over a year.<p><pre><code>   For new investors, Mattermark and Dashboard.io aim to be a check on a startups performance. Both companies are also experimenting with their notifications system. Based on an investors specifications, they may be able to alert customers to a hot opportunity.

   One of Morrills favorite examples is Instagram, a startup that was acquired by Facebook for a cool $1 billion, making its investors extremely rich. Back in Instagrams early days in 2010-11, before the founders raised any significant funding, the photo-sharing app was growing its Twitter following at a double-digit percentage each month.

   It would have been a great signal that consumers were hooked, [and] the reality is that we could have identified it, says Morrill.
</code></pre>
This is a horrible example. Instagram&#x27;s co-founder, Kevin Systrom, was a former Google employee who raised $500,000 from Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz in 2010 for a location-based service called Burbn. Instagram grew out of that, and when Instagram raised its Series A about a year later, the roster of investors was a who&#x27;s who of Silicon Valley (Benchmark, Jack Dorsey, Adam D&#x27;Angelo, etc.).<p>The idea that Mattermark or a similar service could have identified Systrom and company before they were tapped into top-tier funding sources, enabling a less-than-well-connected angel or second or third-tier venture firm to get in on Instagram&#x27;s Series A, is utterly unrealistic.<p>The serious angels and firms are actively engaged in the market and talking to founders on a daily basis, and serious founders looking for funding are making the rounds on Sand Hill Road, volunteering the most salient data that is almost never shared publicly (think revenue, revenue growth, etc.).<p>Mattermark&#x27;s proposition seems to be &quot;There are a couple of young guys who are wet behind the ears in a garage somewhere with a hot app, and if you call them up, you might be able to convince them to take your money before [insert prominent angel or firm] discovers them.&quot; That is a flawed proposition because this is simply not how the game works.",1377195745

They should have checked all of his belongings and let him go, and not focused at all on his &quot;attitude&quot;. That allows for more checks of other suspicious people with the available time they wasted questioning this one person.<p>The Boston bombers should also have been allowed to fly freely. Their actions had nothing to do with air travel.<p>Either way the situation described is unacceptable, either as &quot;racist&quot;, or &quot;Xenophobic&quot;, or, to your point, as an incredibly inefficient way to carry out profiling.",1377194550

Someone goes to the airport on the first day of Ramadan, refuses the scan, sets off the chemical detectors, then asks to leave. During further interview he indicates that he hasn&#x27;t eaten yet that day, is travelling for religious purposes, has just moved and is travelling alone.
This further investigation doesn&#x27;t seem insane to me. In fact if there was a clear profile for someone I would investigate it would be him.<p>That said, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to show basic human decency.",1377194544

A two-on-a-lot just went up on across the street from me, not 50 feet from where we had an 5-way shootout in broad daylight two years ago. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when they got snapped up for $750k a piece; I pay $500/month in rent. Just in the last week somebody started parking their new Porsche in front of my house, on a street where I still wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving my old 1997 Civic overnight. Various brewpubs, taprooms, etc. have started opening up. This feels exactly like how people describe living in the Mission circa fifteen years ago.",1377194483

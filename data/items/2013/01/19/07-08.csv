However it took a while to realize it and I had to look up the stats in order to see it.<p>The algorithm the bot used was really simple. In poker terms you'd call the bot-player a rock. He bets when he has good cards and will always go all-in whatever happens after the flop.<p>You'd think that this algorithm is too simple to be succesful but that's wrong. There are two factors that make this strategy profitable:<p>1. If you play on low limits the players usually play incredibly aggressive and will nearly always lose a lot of money whenever your bot bets.<p>2. Even if you have a winrate of only 55% (which is necessary to not make a minus, because you never play for free, there is a fee for each table) you will make profit because of the cashback your online poker provider will give you after each month.\nThis is also why you have to play a lot of tables. The bot played about 800 tables each day, which is insane. However it does increase the cashback and the more you play, the more money will get each month.",1358581516

5082910,comment,5076757,5077647,2,0,zaroth,,,"I'm not sure if you're trolling? The machines are being removed precisely due to concerns over safety and effectiveness.<p>Efficiency is the number one reason they are being removed, as stated by the TSA. The backscatter machines produce an R-rated image of the person being scanned. This requires secondary personnel to view the image in a separate area and then communicate back to the primary personnel at the checkpoint. TSA asked Rapidscan to write software which could render a non-R-rated image which could be displayed and interpreted at the checkpoint, but Rapidscan could not or would not.<p>If you have studied HCI, the simplicity and efficiency of the interface is highly correlated with the ability of the user to complete a designated task. Making the checkpoint more efficient increases TSA personnel's ability to accomplish their objectives.<p>The UI of the ProVision is specifically designed for 'non-experts' -- it shows a simple stick figure and a bright colored box for any area of the body that triggers an alert. What could be easier to interpret? You can even look at your own results as you walk through.<p>Whether or not you're a fan of TSA, whether you believe the increased efficiency is simply a face-saving excuse to get the ""naked body scanners"" out of there, the TSA's rightfully concluded the ProVision (RF, non-ionizing) scanners are a superior product, and everyone should be happier to get to walk through them rather than the X-ray based machines.<p>Personally I'd be happier not having to queue and walk through any fixed scanner... and they are working on airport designs which will make that a reality.",1358581442

Absolutely true, and MEGA was not created to solve that problem.<p>Possibly the biggest point in the case against MegaUpload was that when they received a DMCA complaint, they deleted only the links mentioned in the complaint. (MU had a standard deduplication system, where if a file is uploaded more than once, the new copy is simply created as a link to the original to save space.) Other links to the same content were left up. The prosecutors claimed MU was required to delete the actual file in storage.<p>MEGA avoids that issue entirely. If every file is encrypted, and MEGA doesn't have the key, they have no way to connect uploads of the same file and remove them en masse. It's true that DMCA complaints can still be issued if a copyright holder discovers a link to a pirated file, but that wouldn't wipe out every other copy at the same time.",1358581406

5082875,comment,5080829,5082325,2,0,sophacles,,,"What's reasonable to me is: not putting any politician on a pedestal. They all suck for a lot of reasons.<p>Unfortunately, you see it on web forums all the time that people have no medium or long term memories: basically they see some politician agreeing with them on some topic and there is much raving about how awesome that person is. Two weeks later, the same politician is against the prevalent view on some other topic, and they are the devil incarnate.<p>Further there is a trend in these discussions to turn everything into ""this guy is from this party, so that party is on my side!"" craziness, and piles of confirmation bias start happening.<p>So I see comments on how various parties will spin any event and posture themselves towards it, with references to a larger political climate - such as the one you quoted first - not as ""anti-$PARTY"" or ""hate"", but as a reminder that the politicians are always playing, a ""here is the game now"" statement.<p>Similarly, regarding your second quote, calling a politician a clown, is not anti republican anything. The senator has a history of open access, but also has a questionable history in larger civil liberties contexts. The senator posturing himself as a champion of Aaron Swartz because of the open access issue, is just that. We've seen a lot of stuff lately reminding us of Aaron's stance on, e.g. Chomsky and the concept of manufactured consent. This politician is in fact doing what Aaron didn't like in the manufactured consent game. It is a reasonable statement to point it out. \nNote: when the framing of this as ""Obama's DOJ"" and other types of strong political gaming that will occur around this, no one will mention Ortiz has been a US Attorney since 1997, and therefore doing this sort of action for many administrations. It will turn into a discussion of which party is responsible, rather than a reasonable discussion about what should be done about an actual problem.<p>In this context, it is reasonable for anyone who wants to address the problem, rather than the politics, to take steps in discussions like this to remind everyone that the person in question may in fact agree with them on this issue, but they, and the party they represent certainly don't agree on every issue. This is a giant problem - the thinking that any party agrees whole-heartedly with your stances, or that any given politician has the right answers to all problems.<p>Finally it should be noted that tptacek gets accused of hating just about every single group that exists at some point. It seems he is in that rare place of ""he thinks for himself"", and so gets these sorts of ""super partisan"" accusations about hating the democrats a lot too. Isn't it great when your knee jerk defense of your chosen favorites causes you to attack someone who regularly gets attacked for being too much on your side?",1358580040

Look into things like Code for America, Make Your Laws, or Votizen; they're not precisely what you're looking for, but they've probably heard about things that are closer.<p>2) Build it. Get to know people who are involved in your local town's politics and build community support for such a web site. Figure out what the needs of the various subcommunities are, including the people who don't speak English, the people who have never used a computer, and the like and figure out how to account for them. Once you've got broad support, you can work on converting people into actually using your site.<p>Yes, it's exactly like a startup. Except that you're not going to turn much of a profit and you can't pick and choose your customer base.<p>3) Keep in mind that any widely used system is going to become a target for optimization and exploitation. That's what government corruption is.",1358579408

This is because the two belong to inconsistent sets, so they conflict.<p>Harmful to what? Prove itand not from first principles, because the human mind seems to have no trouble at all with combining arbitrary and contradictory concepts into one big mushy whole. Ask any non-programmer for software requirements, or really anybody why they did anything and not something else.<p>The only tangible harm is that it annoys people who attempt to apply logical reasoning to every situation and interaction, even where other human faculties are obviously more appropriate.",1358579380

Where to start.<p>First, kindly point at an Cassandra installation, which supports the size that HBase supports in this setting.<p>Can I assume you have first hand information about this decision from someone at Facebook? I was stating a fact... not a jab.<p>Re: Google. <i>Nothing</i> at Google is driven by an eventually consistent store. They got that part right from beginning. It's too hard to manage from the an application point of view (unless you store immutable data, in which eventual consistency is pretty awesome).\nCheckout BigTable, Megastore, Percolator, Spanner. Except for the latter these are all based on BigTable. Note that BigTable is always consistent like HBase (and unlike Cassandra).<p>Are you saying the MySQL is better than PostgreSQL (or vice versa?) because one is easier to setup than the other. That is a terrible way to pick a technology.<p>Out of the box functioning is nice, easy to get started, makes the product look good in benchmarks, etc, but it just hides the complexity until you deploy into a production setting.<p>Lastly, I agree that if you store the odd few TB here or there, you certainly do not need to bother with the complexity of HBase.",1358579061

One day, they'll shut off access to a service enough Facebook users value that users will no longer value Facebook.<p>Twitter is going to learn this lesson the hard way too.",1358579020

And, for example when FB stock dropped to 17 I bought a chunk and put a limit order to sell it at $28 (I ended up getting it at 18 and my limit order was purchase + $10) But again, it was a lot riskier than ""surefire"". When people guarantee results without risk, that is when I say ""oh really? and just how do you do that?""<p>There are lots of ideas, but the tried and true one is 'Ponzi Scheme' :-)",1358578957

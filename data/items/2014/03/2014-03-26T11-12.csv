7472751,comment,7471988,7471988,3,0,Unosolo,,,"The essence of the argument here is that Java is a poor language as it doesn&#x27;t offer simple abstraction to copy standard input into standard output; that Java is too verbose and low-level for the task.<p>The lack of direct abstraction is not a valid argument, because as a programmer, you shouldn&#x27;t be writing the logic in Java, Python, C or Scala but rather a higher order domain language implemented in the chosen host language and that&#x27;s what the process of programming is all about. For the majority of real world programming tasks it&#x27;s unlikely that a language that fits the domain perfectly already exist, so you have to create one.<p>In Java one can say:<p><pre><code>    copyStream(System.in,System.out);\n</code></pre>\nAnd then one will have to implement copyStream but only once:<p><pre><code>    long copyStream (InputStream src,OutputStream dst) throws IOException {             \n        long bytesCopied;\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];\n        int bytesRead = src.read(buffer);        \n\n        while(bytesRead!=-1) {\n            bytesCopied+=bytesRead;\n            dst.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n            bytesRead = src.read(buffer);\n        }\n\n        return bytesCopied;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI prefer programmers taking this approach of implementing domain specific language first and then expressing the logic in its terms instead of trying to express higher order concepts without resorting to available host language abstractions.<p>Let&#x27;s say Python or Perl let one express stream copying more concisely straight out of the box. However when faced with real life programming challenges one will very quickly encounter limits of what a language can express out of the box with one-liner. But as a programmer one has the power to create one-liners from scratch!<p><i>Disclaimer: I am not a Java expert, so the code above is just to illustrate the idea based on my very limited knowledge of Java.</i>",1395834373

By that, I mean they would contract some Asian company to make a printer mechanism that the Atari 400/800 was able to print to, and Atari&#x27;s factories would drape it in plastic that had an Atari logo. In this space, if you saved a screw you were up half a penny, which was a big deal. The printers that Atari produced were famously rickety and very, very slow because Atari was a cheap-ass consumer company that indexed on price and didn&#x27;t care that it took ten minutes to print each page of your 20 page book report for tomorrow morning.<p>I saw the boneyard of printer chassis that didn&#x27;t make it through the qualifying rounds. They were pretty terrifying.<p>- One printer chassis had gone through several revisions, each revision removing some major component (a motor, a solenoid) until just the bare-bones remained. It was clear that each revision reduced the printer&#x27;s ability; what remained was something as close as they were able to get to an abstract <i>idea</i> of printing without actually abandoning the ability to print. I&#x27;m sure the cost-reducers considered that, too (&quot;What if we gave them a tray for a hunk of paper, included a pen, and the instructions said to copy down what was on the screen?&quot;) The Ideal Atari Printer appeared to be a single motor, some kind of print head and a way to advance paper (ideally also driven by that single motor). Wackiness ensued<p>Now repeat that for each minor bit-player in the Asian printer mech market, all of whom were hoping to strike it big by convincing Atari that <i>their</i> bare-bones claptrap should be the winner in the race to the bottom.<p>- There was a color printer that rotated ballpoint pens in a holder and drew vectors. I was intrigued about how this would image anything on the Atari&#x27;s raster display, and this issue was no doubt the reason the mechanism had landed in the boneyard. Still, it had gone through several revisions, and no doubt the Asian engineers were thinking of goofy and cheap ways to spin that pen holder, sans motor.<p>- There was an enormous boat-anchor of a printer, which looked like it had been submitted by a former designer of army tanks. <i>This</i> was the printer you wanted; indestructible, capable of printing in depths of the worst Siberian winter. Whatever you wanted to print, this printer would go through hell, cross mountains, take the enemy city and eventually your printout would emerge, using whatever substance you wanted to print on. Paper? Bark? Stone? Sure, no problem. Unfortunately the shipping costs were probably crazy.<p>- A slightly less battle-oriented printer chassis looked like it had also been submitted to Apple, and had an interesting similarity to the ImageWriter when that was later revealed to the world.<p>Printers today look equally wacky. Just go to an office store and imagine what&#x27;s underneath the plastic. What knife fights drove the reduction in costs? What engineering careers were left on the cutting room floor? There&#x27;s drama in consumer tech design if you dig deep enough. You want to avoid these printers, they will let you down and force you to drive to Kinkos at midnight for the remaining 18 pages of your book report.<p>We recently replaced an old but perfectly working HP laserjet because we couldn&#x27;t find new toner cartridges for it anymore (and remanufactured toner carts <i>suck</i>); replaced it with an un-wacky HP laser printer that I hope will last another 15 years.",1395833728

It requires changing the runtime library and possibly re-writing a lot of in-house infrastructure. While personal affinity to a language is important, making a decision for a company might have substantial business consequences.<p>For a company, overall language adoption, availability of libraries, tools and talent (and I&#x27;m not talking about training someone to be productive; sooner or later you need real experts and training an expert is expensive in any language) are extremely important. That&#x27;s why when choosing between two languages, assuming both are well suited to the job at hand, a company should always pick the one with the wider adoption unless the other is <i>so significantly &quot;better&quot;</i> to trump lesser adoption. And the smaller the adoption, the &quot;better&quot; the language needs to be.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt Haskell is an excellent programming language. I&#x27;m learning it and enjoying it. But because it has such low adoption rates, it needs to provide benefits that are orders of magnitude higher than other, more popular languages. I guess that for some very particular use cases it does, but I just can&#x27;t see it in the vast majority of cases.<p>Hobbyists can afford playing with different languages, and can (and perhaps should) jump from one to the next. Companies can&#x27;t (or most certainly shouldn&#x27;t, unless for toy projects); they should pick (wisely) a popular language that&#x27;s right for them, and just stick with it.<p>BTW, I think that if a company does want to try a good, though not-so-popular language, it should pick a JVM language, as the interoperability among JVM languages, and the availability of libraries that can be shared among the popular and less-so JVM languages, reduces much of the risk.",1395833503

I think there&#x27;s some truth in it.<p>But i think there&#x27;s another significant factor. Java came as a successor, of sorts, to C++. Early Java programmers were former C++ programmers, and its designers had C++ experience (as well Smalltalk, Lisp, etc experience). As a result, many features of Java are responses to pain felt in C++. Feeling the pain of memory leaks and use-after frees? Garbage collection. Feeling the pain of segfaults and incomprehensible pointer chains? No pointer arithmetic (the party line for years was that Java had no pointers, only references). Feeling the pain of baffling symbol use in APIs? No operator overloading. Feeling the pain of aeons-long build times? Compilation to bytecode, with linking left to runtime.<p>I believe this pain response carried over into the culture. The pain in C++ didn&#x27;t just come from the language, but from the fact that people did clever things with it (template metaprogramming had been invented - discovered? summoned? - in 1994). There was a strong association between cleverness and pain. Cleverness was therefore taboo in the brave new pain-free world of Java.<p>There was another point in the grandparent, and in the original post, about Java culture&#x27;s tradition of verbosity. I think this is also a post-C++ thing. In C++, it takes a lot of writing to get anything done. In Java, it takes a bit less. You feel like you&#x27;re moving faster when you write Java. So, as an ex-C++ programmer who has the endurance to write a lod of code, and is feeling the exhilaration of moving fast, what do you do? Write as much code as possible?<p>There has certainly been a huge shift back towards concision in Java, but it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s completely permeated the community. There are people today still learning Java from books written by people who learned in the &#x27;90s and who internalised that logorrheic style.

I knew how to do that in 3rd grade and a different version of it in 4th grade and on, and have never forgotten.  How can somebody not know how to do long division?  Please tell me I'm not the only one?",1177378347

It started out as a simple experimental project (basically I wanted something to meet my own needs).<p>Since then, it's taken on a bit of a life of its own.  <p>The algorithm is basically trying to to simulate the same kinds of things I look for when trying to assess a site (a combination of traffic, SEO, site structure, popularity and other things).  I'm making another big update to the underlying software within the next week or so.  <p>If you have ideas for improvement, please leave a comment (either here or preferably on the websitegrader.com site itself).",1177378151

See show #2 on NerdTV: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/</a><p>He said when he's not doing a start-up he lays on the couch morose, whereas he's happy and enjoying life when he IS doing a start-up.<p>I infer that the secret of success is to link pleasure to working on your start-up and pain to NOT doing it.  If your start-up feels like a grind then it's doomed.  Fortunately, you can re-program your emotional responses via various techniques.<p>You pretty much want to do that regardless so that if you do strike it rich, you don't feel useless and indolent for the rest of your life afterward.  The continued success stories are the people who were REALLY into what they did.  For example, Bill Gates could have retired long ago; Michael Jordan didn't win one championship and decide that was all he wanted; Steve Jobs kept on going while Steve Wozniak checked out, relaxed, and got fat.  (I love Woz, I just think if you're possibly the world's best at what you do, abruptly stopping can't be very fulfilling, even though I understand he did many other worthwhile things like teaching kids.)<p>",1177377714

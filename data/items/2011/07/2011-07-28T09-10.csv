Where is scriptname, and where are the files that scriptname references?  Your sudoers may be set up to replace the environment in such a way that vim looks relative to root's home directory rather than your user's home directory.

I would have thought of trying to teach maths to HN as teaching grandma to suck eggs, but this comment thread (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2737510) led me to believe there are at least a few HNers who don't have calculus etc. as part of their toolbox, and Steves flamboyant OSCON talk (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2811818) got me thinking there might be quite a few who would like it.  FWIW, I've a bachelor's degree in physics and a master's in machine learning.<p>What you get: Eight one-to-one hour-long lessons on any mathematical subject(s) of your choosing.<p>Who qualifies: Exactly one person who wants to, based on the following criteria:<p>1) You ask for something I can actually teach you.  I've a <i>lot</i> of experience teaching maths and physics up to A-level standard (see the UK bit in here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_Mathematics), and I know some linear/vector/matrix algebra, more advanced differential equations, some machine learning and statistics well enough to teach with some brushing up.  I'm slightly more likely to pick someone who wants something I can teach really well rather than something I can just about teach.  You can ask for anything, though; bonus points for asking for something I didnt know people wanted.<p>2) You can be available at a regular time each week which I can accommodate, ideally sometime between 9:00 and 13:00 BST (8:00-12:00 GMT) on a weekday from late August<p>3) You provide a compelling case of how this will help you, particularly if it would be hard to get this kind of help elsewhere.  I.e. you may find some mathematics useful to your coding / business / love life; you know why better than me.<p>Again, apologies if slightly better than high-school maths seems like a trivial thing to arrogantly parade in front of the extremely smart and well-educated people at HN, it just occurred to me there might be a few people who might want it.<p>(EDIT FOR CLARITY) TL;DR: Free online lessons!

Customers like choice, and hate to go to a place where they can't compare prices. That might be zoning (I can imagine Chinese authorities saying ""OK, that street can sell product X), but I think it's also a long standing tradition.<p>Here, shops <i>hate</i> to be near competitors, and it's not unknown for them to lobby the local council over zoning infringements that their competitors are making. This is despite their competitors pulling in a lot of business. After all, shops will pay many times the rent to be in a mall, proximately because that's where the customers are, but ultimately because that's where the competition is.<p>OK, a small hamburger joint needs to worry if McDonalds sets up next door. But if another small hamburger joint sets up nearby, it will increase traffic. The ""competition"" isn't the guy next door. It's the guy next door, the food strip in the mall, and home-cooked food; and only the guy next door is pulling in foot-traffic to your area. But guess who most business owners will try to put out of business?",1311844928

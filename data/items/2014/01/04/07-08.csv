I kept them without using them for a few months and decided I didn&#x27;t really need them after all. Since they were a few hundred dollars worth of parts I didn&#x27;t want to just keep them or get rid of them, I wanted to return them. Even though their policy is &quot;satisfaction&quot; guaranteed, I felt like I was abusing the good faith of the policy--knowing just how heavily discounted their garage sale items are.<p>What I ended up deciding to do was returning them but asking for an 80% refund. The guy behind the counter gave me a really weird look and told me he had to ask if that was even allowed. Luckily for me, it was.

(See note below for an example of a feature designed badly).<p>Still, Evernote fills a need I have that unfortunately there is no other solution for. And while it&#x27;s taking a long time, it <i>is</i> gradually improving. So I&#x27;m still hoping that, one day, Evernote fulfils its destiny and becomes as amazing as it could be.<p>Note: Example of a badly deigned feature: tagging support is crazy-bad - you can tag things, and you can even organise tags into a tag hierarchy - except, no you can&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s only supported on some platforms. And the &quot;support&quot; for it is purely visual - selecting a &quot;parent&quot; tag <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> auto-select the child tags, so it is basically no help. So let&#x27;s go to solution 2, which is to tag things with a prefix, like &quot;History\\Middle Ages&quot; and &quot;History\\US&quot;. But now, their generally awesome tag-completer will be annoying, since it will force you to type &quot;History\\&quot; before getting to the point. So lets reverse tag it, like &quot;US (History)&quot;. No, that wont&#x27; work, since you can search tags by prefix (e.g. search for anything with a tag starting with &quot;History&quot;) but not by tag suffix. Even though, through the UI, you <i>can</i> do this, you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do it with an actual search, so you can&#x27;t select these tags.",1388821345

But just because it&#x27;s still there doesn&#x27;t mean people are spending much time obsessing over the gossips of yesterday; just like those in tribal societies, the news of yesterday is quickly forgotten, and soon supplanted by the urgent, pressing news of TODAY.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure in Archimedes&#x27;s or Newton&#x27;s days most people weren&#x27;t sitting around removed from society on their parents&#x27; farms inventing calculus, or holed up in towers devising calculating machines and giant ship incendiary weapons... rather, they were going to the county dance, swilling home-brewed beer with the neighbors, and gossiping about the same things we gossip about today: wasn&#x27;t it scandalous how Ellyn was behaving with the men at the dance? Isn&#x27;t it a crime how much the poor are taxed by the local lord, while he lives in luxury? How unfair it is that the law applies so unevenly between peasant and lord! Can you believe that Brom and Beatrix are fighting again?<p>Despite the very long period of leisure that medieval peasants had during wintertime, not a whole lot of scientific or technological progress came out of the peasantry. While I agree there&#x27;s little more satisfying than building something yourself, I&#x27;d differ with the article in suggesting that the masses of people today are in fact no different than the masses of people of times past - a minority produces new things, while the majority handles the day-to-day of maintaining what we&#x27;ve already got, and spends its leisure time consuming the output of those producers who&#x27;ve successfully managed to produce things others want and/or things useful to those others.",1388820257

In that case, let&#x27;s keep in mind that  many (most?) of the kids who spent all their time &quot;hacking&quot; did so because they were often excluded from more social activities. Remember, there <i>was essentially no social reward</i> for &quot;hacking&quot; (unlike getting good grades, being a great athlete, able to tell jokes, speak in public, dance, sing, play an instrument and most other skills kids might develop).<p>Sure, today hacking is &quot;cool&quot; .. because money, fame and power are cool and many hackers have achieved that. But until very very recently (last couple years), the only reasons a kid would start hacking were curiosity and having little else to do because <i>they</i> couldn&#x27;t (or didn&#x27;t want to) fit in.<p>With that in mind, this article disturbs me in a way I can&#x27;t easily explain. Particularly when she describes feeling like an imposter &quot;in the face of the <i>desirable</i> hacker stereotype&quot; and even claims the nerdy clothes that hackers wear are <i>in and of themselves exclusionary</i> simply because one might choose to be more fashionable.<p>This is <i>no different</i> from her stereotypical &quot;hacker&quot; complaining about having to wear different attire to fit in at a school dance (or should he/she later choose to go into banking, law or any profession other than programming at a startup).<p>I went to a top high school, where academic excellence (grades, SATs, AP tests, what college you got into, etc) was definitely <i>cool</i> and admired. <i>Even then</i>, if you saw a kid hacking in the hallway (or painting or otherwise working on things completely of their own choosing) you knew that he/she was likely at the bottom of the social totem pole.<p>These very people are who pg was speaking to in many of his early essays like <a href""http://paulgraham.com/nerds.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a><p>The fact of the matter is that a disproportionate number of the best hackers come from that population. Those who were the &quot;cool kids&quot; in high school may want in now, but they&#x27;ll have to earn their place at the table. If that means working ungodly hours, having to change the way they speak or dress to &quot;fit in&quot; .. when in Rome ..<p>(please do not misinterpret anything I wrote as condoning sexism, which is despicable in any setting)",1388820022

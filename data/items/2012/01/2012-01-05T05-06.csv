When we accept this idea, we are edging into the idea of Internet access as a civil right""<p>Let's not confuse access to Internet (which is described here) and <i>free</i> access to it. You can have free service to all houses in the US but if the likes of SOPA are implemented, I think most people agree that some rights are being trampled on.

ISBNs, dead trees, the works.<p>The first one (Flexible Rails) was something I self-published on Lulu as I wrote it.  It started at about 200 pages and ended up over 500 pages before I did a deal with a traditional publisher.<p>At what point was it a book? My publisher approached me about publishing my book, not my manuscript (or rose).  People all over the world bought my book when it was just a PDF.  It made my mortgage payments for a while.  In fact about 70% of my profit over my book's lifetime was from PDF sales.<p>As its author, I considered it a book when I first published it.  My readers did too.  Publishers like O'Reilly, the Prags and Manning probably consider their beta / early access books to be books.<p>Finally (since I'm typing on a phone), ebooks are to physical books like web apps are to shrinkwrapped software: you can do way more releases.  At what point is a release real?  Our answer is it is when you have paying customers.  That is a commitment to your readers, and it helps you write and keeps you motivated.<p>So, to sum up the ramble: in 5 years almost all books will be ebooks, most will have multiple releases (including before being ""finished""), and this author's opinion will be quaint.",1325743079

3427554,comment,3425942,3425942,1,0,gexla,,,"Nope, never a mass profession.  Here's why.<p>1.  This partially depends on which area of programming you are talking about.  The web development industry is not an area which sees mass hiring.  Most web development shops are small teams or one man shops.  Running a web development shop is very hard because you have to make a living from running your business as opposed to punching a clock at work.  Web development is difficult enough, add all that is required to make a living off it and that cuts the number of people who are able to make it by quite a bit.  The article mentions Elance and Odesk jobs which pay ""$15 to $20 or more per hour"" but the only people who are able to make a living off those wages are living in low wage companies.  In the U.S. you might as well be flipping burgers rather than attempting to live as a freelancer at those rates.<p>The same could largely be said for startups, mobile apps, etc.<p>2.  How many coders does companies such as Google and Facebook have compared to the peak of companies such as Ford?    Coding is not and never will be the sort of mass employment industry as manufacturing has been.<p>3.  Coding requires a great deal of self motivation to learn and keep up with.  Most people aren't willing to put in the effort that this requires.  I learn by doing and I have never had the patience for books, classroom learning or even tutorials.  Most people can't pick this stuff up without the sort of structured learning environment which doesn't work well for learning how to code.  The number of people who are willing to put in this effort is likely the same percentage of people who are coders today.<p>4.  The labor crunch in the coding industry is not just a crunch of people who know how to code, but rather a crunch for coders who are near the top.  The industry could find plenty of people if they are looking for mediocre developers, but that's not where the jobs are going.<p>5.  Knowing the basics of coding for working magic in spreadsheets isn't the same as being handed the keys to commit code to the crown jewels of the company.  No matter how many people who know how to code and no matter what the basic expectations are for prospective employees, there won't ever be a significant increase in the number of people who are able to write the code which drives the company.<p>If the industry needs more coders, then probably the best solution at this point is to be more open to remote developers.   That will increase the pool available.  Education will also increase the pool, but not on a massive scale.",1325741723

3427488,comment,3426797,3426797,11,0,dkarl,,,"I liked Richard Dawkins' pick of the double-blind experiment.  However, the significance of it for the lay person is entirely in why it is necessary.  The concept itself is only a consequence.  It's nice for people to know what a double-blind experiment is, but it doesn't give them an instant ability to evaluate scientific research.  Even double-blind experiments can be flawed, and you wouldn't want people thinking they could trust the validity of a study just because it's double-blind.  If consumers and voters started demanding double-blind experiments, advertisers and other liars would have no problem producing misleading results from double-blind studies.<p>No, the significance of double-blind studies is in why scientists have to go to such extraordinary lengths to escape bias.  The ways bias can influence judgment and can be communicated subconsciously between people are pretty amazing, and they justify the skepticism that scientifically literate people take for granted but other people take for unreasonable stubbornness.  ""My uncle has seen ghosts, my cousin has seen ghosts, and I just told you I saw a ghost.  Why don't you believe in ghosts?  You just refuse to believe because paranormal phenomena are embarrassing to your narrow scientific worldview.""<p>To help people understand why scientifically literate people think they way they do, we need to tell them stories about how bias affects experiments and leads to bogus results.  In his essay about cargo cult science, Richard Feynman tells a great story about an experimenter who discovered an unexpected source of bias in an experimental setup for rats running a maze.  That's a perfect example for the general scientific audience, for whom rats running mazes is an icon of objective quantitative science, but the general public needs examples where psychological bias creates results that they personally know to be important and know to be false.  Understanding those stories will give them a completely new outlook on the information they take in every day.<p>Also, the stories need to put people in a serious frame of mind.  No matter what their level of ignorance, people have enough meta-cognitive sophistication to worry that if they absorb our scientific skepticism they will miss out on a lot of fun things.  They <i>like</i> believing in ghosts.  They <i>like</i> believing in aliens.  They like believing that there are extraordinary things in the world that are as accessible to them as science and technology are to the nerds.  We're trying to rob them of their fun.  Sure, they can still play at believing, but it won't be quite as thrilling.  (It really is just as fun to watch <i>The X-Files</i> or read Harry Potter when you're scientifically literate, but I don't think they'd believe us if we told them :-)  Also, it's a lot less fun to listen to your friends tell stories about how they saw a ghost in the Winchester Mystery House and how they know it was real because the tour guide knew what it looked like without being told because other people had seen the same one.  Sigh.)<p>To get around resistance to the lifeless, booooring scientific worldview, we need something awful to shake people out of that fun frame of mind.  Children dying of cancer because of biased studies, something like that.  Even better, children getting abducted and molested.  TV news shows know how to make people pay attention; let's put their techniques to good use.  Unfortunately, my scientific education stopped after my sophomore year of college, so I'll leave it up to others to provide concrete examples ;-)",1325740129

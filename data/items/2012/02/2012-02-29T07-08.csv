Don't get me wrong, the price should be rising, but not this quickly. Broader market forces are at play in this and I would expect a market correction to occur in the coming weeks or months, which will have a significant effect on AAPL because it has a beta hovering around 2. Of course, the question is: When will the correction take place?",1330502315

Offering dividends is not what true growth companies with good plans for the future do. FWIW, I'm far from risk-averse; I wouldn't invest in a single company that offers a dividend due to the implied lack of growth and innovation that is implied by giving away retained earnings that could be used for R&D, strategic acquisitions and new business initiatives. In Apple's case, this includes new markets/products, increased retail exposure and strategic exclusive supply chain deals.<p>I hope, for Apple's sake and our own, that they don't offer a dividend anywhere in the near future, if ever.",1330502127

Just what copyright interest does this place have in a crack for Kaspersky antivirus, dare I ask?  There are also random PasteBins, but those at least appear to be links to torrents.<p>There are also a few other items which do not appear to be infringing on that particular notice:  item #255, which is some random forum thread on AnimeSuki where people are discussing a high school related anime, a news article by the Independent on that cruise ship captain (#250), and some digital graphics site (#251) that seems to be completely unrelated to anything.<p>So yeah, I don't see why they'd sign off on statements from some broken keyword matching robot, knowing that it wasn't very good.",1330501235

As the debt risk of countries becomes closer to the strongest multinationals it creates the possibility for the debt of multinationals to be lower risk than any currency it can be denominated in, which happened briefly a couple years ago for the first time ever. In effect, the debt instruments are currency.<p>Right now, governments have the ability to inflate their currencies to pay for their excessive spending. If non-governmental instruments become stronger than reserve currencies then it will create a novel situation where they can't inflate away the debt even if every other government is doing it. That is new territory. Companies that generate and preserve value on a global basis will have financial instruments that are de facto currencies, much in the way gold is.<p>That would be an interesting time.",1330500131

3646862,comment,3645264,3646088,2,0,vonmoltke,,,"Depends on how you want to frame the problem.  I work on sensor systems where we could only save off a small fraction of the raw data coming off the sensor.  All data processing must be done in real time, in-memory, with the system only saving off (sending out) a reduced set of processed output products.  That problem isn't new, though; military, meteorological, seismic, and space sensors have operated with that constraint for decades, since the advances that allow us to collect data have consistently outstripped the advances that allow us to record data.<p>Processing these problems requires a different mindset, and we are reaching a point now where business and web data flows are reaching the point that these sensor applications have been at for decades: they need real-time processing, with a concept of perishable data and a deadline for processing that data into some intermediate or final product that can be stored for later use.<p>Your second point is still very much a concern with this paradigm, though.  The applications I speak of usually have some degree of natural parallelism in the sensor hardware, typically tied to the number of A/D channels coming off the sensor.  Despite that, there are still unsolved[1] computational mapping issues with respect to breaking these processing tasks up beyond their natural boundaries.  These sensors, and many of the emerging analytics applications, are not processing sets of independent jobs the way the MapReduce paradigm envisioned them.  The parallel threads need information from each other to generate their output products, which complicates the division of labor and the execution control.<p>From what I have seen thus far, few big data platforms address the real-time or near-real-time use cases.  The applications I work on currently use MPI grids on a cluster for parallel processing, which to me is the original big data platform.  Not saying its the best way to do it, but nothing I've seen with the label ""big data"" can replace it.<p>[1] Unsolved in the sense that there is no one right answer or set of answers.  There are certainly application-specific ways to ""make it work"".",1330499705

Or if those average lawyers managed to get something that would build/compile/run, would it make sense for them to complain that ""computers are too hard"" or ""developers are too expensive"" when the sad little program they produced crashed, with horrible results?<p>No, that would be crazy.<p>Lawyers should let developers and programmers work on technical things. And developers and programmers should let lawyers work on legal things.<p>Legal fees are ""extreme"" if you're looking at the most expensive big name firms - but that's like walking past a Ferrari dealer and deciding you can't afford to buy a car.<p>There are tons of ordinary attorneys who charge relatively reasonable fees - but many people think that, just like everything on the Internet should be (almost) free because it's all just bits, that everything lawyers do should be (almost) free because it's all just words on paper.<p>If you really want to be in the ""legal space"", the effort and resources involved starts with three years of law school and passing a bar exam.<p>There are attorneys who don't use a traditional hourly billing approach - in particular, and relevant to your concerns mentioned above, some attorneys for small business charge a set monthly or yearly fee for reasonably limited access to the attorney for advice and basic document drafting, etc. If an attorney could get, say, 20 companies to sign up for $1000/month, the attorney would gross $240K, giving them, say, $140K for overhead and $100K for compensation, which isn't great or awful. The companies would be able to use, on average, 8 hours/month of the attorney's time, which is enough to get some good ongoing advice and handle little issues.<p>If those companies wanted to pay $500/month for legal services, the attorney could probably fire his/her staff, not rent a fancy office, and work out of their home and the clients' conference rooms instead. Of course, then the companies don't get to whine about how they have to leave a voicemail when they call the attorney, and they don't get to go sit in a fancy conference room in a tall building and feel important while talking to their attorney.<p>Some people are doing that. (Not me, by the way.) I think it makes sense. Perhaps you could write software that would help those attorneys manage their practices, or build a site that would help attorneys and clients find each other. (there are already a lot of those, and there's a new one that pops up every couple of weeks, so I'm pretty cynical about that .. but the online dating market, which isn't so dissimilar, is pretty mature, but people like plentyoffish or okcupid manage to survive and grow despite the match.com juggernaut, so it's obviously possible.)",1330499682

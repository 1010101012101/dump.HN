I consider myself a capable (just capable) programmer and my abilities pale in comparison to his.<p>My primary knowledge is of philosophy.  What this has allowed me to do is come to the conclusion that programming is an extension of datawalke's very being.  He doesn't just work as an IT guy.  His very existence guarantees both his programming ability and its perpetual growth.<p>I know for a fact that he is grossly underpaid and devalued.    What he hasn't mentioned is that even on top of this job he works frequently on side projects for clients who have never been dissatisfied (to my knowledge).

They make some /really effective/ drugs for that these days, amongst other things, but as for 'hacks' to avoid that weakness?  becoming a SysAdmin is one.  If you can perform well in emergency situations, where you /can't/ drop things on the floor, lots of half-finished projects get forgiven.   (and really, in SysAdmin work, if you don't take care of something when it's not an emergency, you take care of it when it /is/)   I mean, it's bad to not complete things in non-emergency situations, maybe even worse than being a less productive programmer.  But if you can 'hero' it out, even if that is the sub-optimal solution, you usually don't get fired for it.  Management forgets that you only notice your sysadmin if he's not doing his job.<p>But, I find even the threat of an emergency motivates me to fix things, so I don't think add sysadmins need to remain in the less-useful 'hero' role forever... but being a sysadmin does mean that our failure mode usually doesn't get us fired.<p>If you can manage to hold down a job long enough to get some good experience, hiring other people can also be a way to get around this.   I can start something and have someone else come along and clean up behind me.  Also, just working with other people, I find, helps keep me on task.<p>but really, if I didn't have a skill that was relatively hard to find, well, for most of my life, I'd  have had a hard time holding down a job at McDonalds.

1476192,comment,1476072,1476072,0,0,speby,,,"It just depends. If the profit towards the end of the year isn't too bad, it's possible to pay as much of that out as possible as a bonus to founders and/or employees. Obviously, the company pays taxes on the wages (state/federal/medicare/etc) and you personally pay income taxes, too. In some cases, this may be a lower, overall tax hit than paying the same amount out to founders as dividends only. It certainly depends on the total amount in question, too.<p>It is possible to also retain most, or all, of the profits at the end of the year within the company. As was stated, though, corporate income taxes must be paid on that. Up to about $75,000, the tax rate is pretty low and not a huge deal but after that, corporate income taxes are pretty steep and as a young business, it's definitely good practice not to give Uncle Sam a dime more than you have to so if you have a huge windfall of profits, you might reconsider whether to retain it all or not.<p>Another option is to report as much expense as possible so as to have deductions against the corporation's income. Naturally, this means spending actual money and giving it to someone else but it also means avoiding tax. So if you can do this with things the business needs (or even paying for some things way in advance and up-front), the loss in the time value of $ is still far less than the tax consequence that otherwise would have been incurred (example: pay for all of your hosting needs 6 months in advance before Dec 31st, provided you are on a cash accounting basis and a calendar fiscal year)",1277931188

In the :update and :display callbacks you're given both the total elapsed time and elapsed time since the last frame (in seconds); use those to calculate the positions of objects.<p>2. I think the major confusion you have is what the (anim ...) macro should return.  The answer's actually pretty straightforward: a function which takes the current time, and returns the position for that time.  That function will be stored in the global state of the application, and sampled every time you draw a frame.<p>If you want to change an animation, all you need to do is swap out the animation in one of the callbacks.  These callbacks don't have to necessarily be in response to user actions; look at how app/periodic-update is used in the Tetris and Asteroids examples.<p>If you have any further questions, the mailing list is at <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/penumbra-lib"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/penumbra-lib</a>.",1277930823

You've created an argument out of a thought, which is, to strive for stability and equality. All I've stated thus far is that Capitalism is a stepping stone to something <i>better</i>. No matter how many times I repeat this, you are asserting an argument.<p><i>That is simply not true. The core principal of capitalism is that people engage in mutually beneficial transactions without the threat of physical harm.

Some people call it greed, but I don't want to demonize a population.<p>Capitalism isn't evil, it's a cloak.<p>The promise of success keeps us all herding towards the door of opportunity, but only a few pass almost regardless of intelligence, morals, motivations or intentions.<p>When your insurance refuses coverage, it isn't because there's an evil <i>asshole</i> lurking to ensure you don't get what you deserve.<p><i>Company A</i> announces <i>incentives</i> for employers for saving the company money. Those who aren't on-board get reviews, get fired. The workers who respond to incentives deny your claim. You're now fucked, to put it lightly. <i>Company A</i> is now full of incentive-driven bias.<p>This is just 1 course of Capitalism. You don't need me to dig up research or some book about societal structure and how it applies to Capitalism. You see it everyday.<p><i>Please go read some literature on this. And I don't mean that in a negative way. You seem genuinely open to new ideas but you seemingly are not willing to seek those new ideas.</i><p>I plan to. And yes, I am very open and very willing to seek new ideas and support those with more knowledge and more ability to drive these efforts. However, I am not willing to listen to steadfast, obstinate reasoning for future consideration.<p>I appreciate that there are those (like yourself) that don't put up with the hearsay and nonsensical banter, but I'm not your target.

This was my first job after graduating from college.  I have learned a great number of things at this job and have had some great experiences.  Now I'm ready to move on.  This is due to several factors, but there are two main ones.  First, I've been getting increasingly frustrated with the huge bureaucracy in this company and it's not getting any better.  Second, I feel like my technical skills are stagnating.  The product I work on is a large legacy codebase and it's very hard to fit in any new technologies.  When my company talks about using “new” technologies, these are things that are at least 5 years old.  Many times, these technologies are already obsolete.<p>I'd like to get a new job doing some kind of web development.  I know a little about it, but I really would like to sharpen my skills in this area.  I have a side business where I've built and maintain a couple of e-commerce websites using PHP/MySQL.  I've also done some work with Drupal and built a small site with web2py.  I'm currently learning about Django and Codeigniter, but I haven't built anything of importance with them.<p>I'm really having a hard time trying to figure out how to reinvent myself and my professional experience.    My resume looks very good if I'm trying to get another job in the defense industry.  This is the last thing I want.  I can learn and pick up new things quickly.  I know how to design and write quality code.  I have experience in large-scale systems architecture.  I know how to properly design an API.  I just don't have the experience of doing these things in the web domain.<p>I'd like to get some pointers from the HN community about how I should reinvent myself.  Hopefully somebody out there has gone through a similar situation.  I appreciate any feedback you can give.<p>I'd also like to get people's opinion on the effectiveness of an online profile at these sites:<p>LinkedIn<p>VisualCV<p>Stackoverflow",1277930318

For any amount above contributions taxes must be paid. The corporation must pay corporate tax on any of the revenue it received, with exception to any deductions that match up, etc.<p>If you have only provided sweat equity and are taking a draw against the income of the business, you must pay taxes on that income, in addition to the corporate tax (double taxation as you mentioned).<p>In most cases, startups seem to be keeping as much money in the business and taking as small of a draw as possible. This is for a variety of reasons: avoiding double taxation while the business is young, having more capital available for growing the business, having more money available for investing than would be available if you drew the cash and took the tax hit, etc.<p>But remember, people have to eat, and need a roof over their heads. Unhappy miserable people probably lend to lower productivity; some people would probably say the opposite, that uncomfortable unhappy situations make a person more jazzed up to ""get things done"" but I don't personally like that form of motivation.<p>It makes a lot of sense to hire an accountant, specifically one that understands startups if possible. Sure, you could figure out all the technicalities of running the books on your own, and then managing the tax filings, but it's more complicated than personal taxes, and you're risking your startup legally.

Multiple roles suffer the same problem as singular roles in that the name has boundaries.  It is harder to see where the lines blur (the shades of gray) because you have lines.  Looking for the blur in the first place is a sign that you have accepted an arbitrary label with its connotations and are trying to climb your way out of that casting.<p>This is an example of where the language itself limits you.  You hack, so you are a hacker.  But ""hacker"" does not just mean ""one who hacks"".

Do you own a t-shirt that talks about your love of hackerdom?  ""10 kinds of people understand binary""?

If you have never intimately known or been yourself suicidal (and managed to recover from it), for example, you would see that part of the problem is an inability to change, a clinging to the past, to an identity.  Others and I were trying to eliminate that identity.  We had to change in order to continue living.  A similar problem exists for job loss.<p>Another way to look at this is to consider your choices.

1476059,comment,1474941,1474941,0,0,dasht,,,"I was one of the hacker employees of the FSF back in the early days of the HURD project.  They pay was modest by industry standards but fair (every employee, hacker or not, got the same pay -- later the formation of a union was encouraged).<p>Some very good and lasting work got done back then, in spite of our rather unconventional work habits.  I'm thinking especially of all the work done laying down the foundation of GNU libc.  Roland McGrath got a lot of code rolling and, perhaps more importantly, established a pretty good standard of coding conventions and quality expectations.<p>I did not myself work directly on the HURD but in our small office I did have chats with McGrath and Bushnell about it.  The sentiment around the design was, I think it fair to say, somewhat giddy.   The free software movement was (and is) all about freeing users from subjugation to those who provide software.  The HURD's microkernel architecture and the structure of the daemons would securely free users from subjugation to system administrators - each user could securely invoke a set of daemons to create the operating environment he or she wished, no special permissions required.<p>It was well understood back then, and even a point of discussion in academia, that a microkernel architecture posed some difficult problems for performance (related mostly to a greater number of context switches as messages pass between daemons rather than syscalls being handled by a monolithic kernel).   Rashid's work had suggested that this problem was not so terribly significant after all.  And so, at least to me, it felt like the GNU project was not only doing this shoestring-budget freedom-fighting hacking, but also leading near the bleeding edge of CS research made practical.   Well, that was the theory, anyway, and we were mighty proud of ourselves and generally excited to be there.<p>Not much but some of the hacking of the core staff took place ""from home"".  You must remember that this before any kind of data over voice or particularly high bandwidth connection was commonplace - so that hacking was over modem connected to text terminal.   Mostly we hacked in a shared office which, if you saw it, you'd think ""Wow, that's a slightly large closet.""   We were, at that time, guests of MIT.<p>With all due respect for RMS, and I don't think he'd especially disagree with this (though I could be wrong): he was an absolutely terrible project leader for the hacking part.   As history has shown, his popularity among some notwithstanding, he's extraordinarily good at the political part of his works.   Leading the technical project?  Not so much.<p>It wasn't so much that he dictated bad technical choices.  Even the choice to use Mach might have worked out.  On the contrary, he was relatively ""hands off"" in most technical matters, only micromanaging if you really dragged his attention to some detail.  It was more that he lacked any coherent overall strategy for completing GNU and his broad directives involved underestimations of the amount of work involved and were sometimes scattered, even bordering on inconsistent.   It just wasn't his strength.<p>The original vision for the GNU system, at least as I understood it, was to - sure - grow a unix clone, but then to build a user space that much more closely resembled that of lisp machines.   Emacs (with its lisp extensibility) was taken to be a paradigm for how interactive programs might work.  Originally, it was even envisioned that the window system would be lisp based.<p>One early change to the original GNU vision occurred when it became clear that X11 worked pretty well and was here to stay and would be free software.   As a practical matter: just use that.<p>Later, as mentioned in other comments here, the ECGS fork of GCC caused issues - ultimately leading to the displacement of an FSF appointed project leader.  There is some back story to that.   The company Cygnus (later acquired by Red Hat, founded by M. Tiemann et al.) had been advertising to customers that not only could they develop customized extensions to GCC, but that they could shepherd those extensions into the ""official releases"".  There was frustration at Cygnus and some other firms that the FSF branch was not merging these changes quickly enough or was arguably being too prickly about the nature of the changes.  As nearly as I can tell those sentiments led to the ECGS fork and RMS was ultimately put in the position of having to choose between ""blessing"" that fork or simply losing any claim at all to the future of GCC.<p>Around this time, I am told but can not myself verify, RMS was also under pressure from some key FSF advisors or supporters to exit the software development business and focus on the politics.   Whatever the motivation, the FSF shed most of its in-house development efforts.<p>The pattern of losing the original GNU vision continued in the controversy over Gnome vs. KDE.   Originally, KDE had licensing issues and did not pass muster with the FSF as being free software.  Those problems have since been fixed but at the time it led to RMS' proclamation that Gnome would be the desktop for GNU -- a radical departure from what was originally conceived.  Later, as you may have read, RMS came to describe Miguel as a traitor to the free software movement.<p>Somewhere in there - I'd have to look things up to get the timelines exactly right - Debian took off, in part to try to fill a void in the FSF's leadership at assembling a complete GNU system.   Bruce Perens penned the now famous ""Debian Guidelines"".<p>A small group of relatively wealthy influencers, including Tiemann, met with Eric Raymond and conjured up the allegedly business-friendly ""open source"" notion.  The main differentiation they sought from the FSF is that they would not condemn proprietary software or describe themselves as a freedom movement - they sought to emphasize the economic advantages of having volunteers do work for no pay.   In my view, their main purpose upon founding was to attempt to politically marginalize RMS (a project in which they've had some success).<p>Bushnell moved on to a different stage of his life and, I guess it's fair to say, a higher calling.   McGrath moved on to what I gather is a sweet job for Red Hat.  The GNU project was gutted.  Its institutional memory and such momentum as it may have had was gone.  This was in part because RMS was not so great as a project leader but also, in large part, because the project was under significant attack.<p>In my humble opinion, there would be plenty good to come of a resurrection of the GNU project.  I don't necessarily mean a resurrection of the HURD although I suspect we can do better than the Linux kernel.   I do mean a return to a concentrated effort to build the kind of user space originally envisioned.   While such a project could have enormous social benefit, I don't see any way to institute it and find support enough to carry it out.",1277929143

1476052,comment,1475436,1475914,0,0,samps,,,"While you're right that the main problem has to do with sharing resources between different threads of execution, the difficult part is not actually <i>doing</i> that sharing. The simple act of sharing data is very simple, and can be accomplished via many different helpful abstractions (try looking at Wikipedia's description of ""shared memory"" or ""message passing""). In the case of shared memory, sharing can be accomplished just by writing data to memory in one thread and reading it in another. Easy!<p>The difficult part is in how the threads actually coordinate. The problem is extremely application-specific (what exactly do threads need to share? When do they need to share it? These cannot be answered in a general way). It's generally accepted that concurrency bugs (examples: data races (colloquially ""race conditions""), deadlock, atomicity violations, locking discipline violations) are extremely difficult bugs. This is probably either because (1) programmers are not accustomed to thinking about coordinating between parallel activities or (2) people are in just worse at thinking concurrently than thinking sequentially.<p>So new libraries/methods for accomplishing communication between threads are always welcome and can help reduce the complexity of parallel programming. However, nobody has yet found an abstraction that both works for most kinds of parallel programs (MapReduce is very simple to work with but also very restrictive) and is simple enough for people to program in without fear of hard-to-solve concurrency bugs (message passing and shared memory are both quite general but considered somewhat unsafe).<p>So, the problem is not that a good abstraction layer would be too computationally expensive -- it's that no one even knows what the abstraction should be!

1476037,comment,1475613,1475818,0,0,jakevoytko,,,"It probably depends a lot on the industry. If your ticket purchase works, you never need to speak to a human being to ride a bus. Contrast this with cable companies - to sign up, you must have at least two customer service experiences: one to schedule the appointment, one to have the service installed. I think this accounts for their generally poor public opinion. They're not actually worse than most companies, but their customer service footprint is frontloaded and big.<p>I bet Greyhound receives an extremely low call volume in comparison. After all, by default, you don't talk to a human. Most callers with special complaints are probably routed to people with scripts that have most arrows point to ""I'm sorry, but I can't help you. Do you have any other issues today?"", and Greyhound has made the calculation that this will not impact their bottom line.",1277928653

You could require a 1-year subscription to make it more worth your effort (and the bulk purchasing might mean you make more money on the sale of the magazine itself)<p>2nd edit: Thinking about this some more, the magazine is 40 pages long (yay!) but at $.20/page you're making only $1/sale in gross margins (boo!). If you were able to accept yearly subscriptions and fulfill from the US (I know you're in Malaysia) you could boost gross margins to $3/sale, in addition to the cash flow benefits. You would be adding fulfillment costs, but it might be worthwhile...<p>AND you could ship internationally if you wanted!  :)",1277928354

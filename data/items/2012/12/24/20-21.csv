When I last looked, it was only really basic stuff.  But they've gotten a TON of media coverage, somehow!  My hope is that they use their size to improve the educational offerings.<p>In my personal experience as a learner,  Code School (codeschool.com) is strictly superior -- clearer instruction, great videos and slides, and interactive repl-like coding experience and much more advanced material.  Only some of it is free though.<p>Khan Academy also has a top-notch format, has a lot of content and it's strictly non-commercial... but the programming stuff kind of spread out all over the place.<p>For the most rigorous teaching I know of that you can get for free, go to Coursera or edX.  They have videos as good as Khan Academy or Code School, and they actually have homework assignments that get evaluated.  You have to wait for the courses to open, but that leads to some good things too, like having lots of peers going through it with you.",1356382770

4964066,comment,4963385,4963385,8,0,zanny,,,"> Our phones are becoming our remote controls for life.<p>I feel really freaking old for a 21 year old.  I got an Iphone 3gs back in 2009 before going into college.  I should have been the target market for most of the tech revolution, right?  I only used the thing to watch youtube, read pdfs, browse websites (never write anything), and take really ugly photos and video.  I rarely made calls with it and canceled text messages entirely in 3 months.  The battery died this summer, and I just got a tracfone just so I can call my grandparents because almost all my vocal communication is done via skype, jabber, or mumble.  Maybe most importantly? I not only never paid for an app, I downloaded a total of like 5 in 3 years.<p>I have a Transformer tablet though, which I still wouldn't call the center of my tech environment, I just use it to read articles, books, and watch video.  I don't even do the picture taking with it because its a giant book and it is so obtuse to photograph with it.  The high DPI screen makes reading wonderful on it though, which is the main reason I have it.  I did get the Transformer + keyboard dock so I had the ability to write when needed.<p>I don't think I'll ever get a 4 - 6"" smartphone again.  Anywhere I go I'll just throw my tablet in a backpack and bring it with me if need be, or just carry it.  You won't shrink the screen any more and I just prefer the 10"" form factor.<p>I still carry about my dumb phone just because we still live in the stone ages of ubiqutious internet. I don't want to pay $50+ a month for data just to have internet on the go.  I already pay way too much to run a DSL signal to my home router.<p>I dunno, I just feel like the smartphone market is saturated.  Modern computers have a very finite limit of influence over the world since they can only impact it through vibrating air, itself, or through emitting electromagnetic radiation in various forms.  And I already have all the audiovisual stimulation that I want already, so I won't be adding any more. An RSS feed of all my choice webnews and the front page of reddit and HN for laughs is all the digital media consumption I really need anymore.",1356382729

In a web service, you don't have to worry about undo server-side, so using this pattern is more an option than a necessity!",1356382246
4964044,comment,4958640,4959347,1,0,zanny,,,"I'd much rather see three distinct languages, with a shared base syntax and style (ie, common formatting of comments, common scope delimiters, common operand behavior - something like C / Java / Javascript).<p>That way, you could have your low level language use pointers, nullables, inline assembly, goto and other ""dangerous"" things that are the most efficient ways to do stuff.  You wouldn't want to have that language crippled like modern C++ though, you would still want modules, a well planned object oriented syntax, a better solution to name mangling, and better readability.<p>You could have an interpreted Java/C# esque applications language that would mostly be similar to modern Java/C#, maybe with auto, a better namespaces implementation (in C#, a class defined in two places with the same namespace and signature have situational behavior that gets really messy, for example).  You would use this language for the application layer.<p>Scripting could just be an autoboxed dynamic language like Python.  Maybe have a whitespace significant and insignificant dialect.  I'd like to see dialects of such a language, where the context it runs from dictates available modules.  Since it would be permissions based, it could function as a shell, web, and glue language depending on where you use it.<p>I do agree on this sentiment though.  The wide base of languages in modern computing makes the whole thing a lot messier than it needs to be, and the lack of any full stack that really ties together nicely and is well thought out without the smudges would be really nice.",1356382182

4964041,comment,4962975,4963901,-1,0,robomartin,,,"The ""pilot error"" is in not testing the solution before trusting it and in making an assumption that the data would be safe in an untested external system.<p>Let me put it into a financial context.  I did a project that added up to some $800K in cost.  Two developers over about a year.  Do you think that for even a microsecond I would trust Dropbox as a backup mechanism without extensive qualification and testing?  And, would I have that as my sole approach to backup?<p>Nope.<p>And this isn't me coming down on Dropbox or suggesting that they are unreliable.  I use Dropbox and I am very happy with the service.  However, based on experience gotten the hard way, I do not use it for anything that is mission critical.  The important stuff is backed-up locally, sometimes with redundant backups.<p>I don't have any sympathy for an engineer who uses a service and relies on it without the proper testing and qualification phase.  Behaving that way is most-definitely, as I said, to be kind, ""pilot error"".<p>It is completely unfair to blame Dropbox for anything.  This is like the idea of cutting-and-pasting code from the Internet and trusting it with a mission-critical aspect of your application without dissecting the code, testing it and fully qualifying it for what it is you need it to do.<p>There are tons of examples of this behavior, perhaps the most common one in the web development community is email validity verification.  How many careless developers copy a regex like this to validate their email and don't think twice about it:<p><pre><code>    ^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$\n</code></pre>\nThese things are all over the web.  And most of them suck.  Even some of the most impressive ones will lead you astray.<p>How many engineers (and, as a result, websites) fail to test and research and end-up with questionable solutions?<p>Would you blame the regex writer for this or the engineer who chose to use it without doing any testing at all?<p>It doesn't matter what the regex author claims or how authoritative the website featuring the regex might be, you have to test it before deploying it!  If you don't test, deploy and then loose customers because it is a bad regex it is YOUR fault, not the author's.  Blaming them is nonsensical.<p>In case you are curious, here's ""the"" solution:  \n<a href=""http://isemail.info/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isemail.info/about</a><p>Not only is it well documented, the author offers test vectors and all of the relevant code and references so that you can take the time to qualify the solution.<p>So, yes, to be redundant, if an engineer does not do his job I am perfectly happy calling it ""pilot error"" and even going as far as calling it ""incompetence"".",1356382140

It's extra overhead when onboarding new developers, more time spent debugging (deeper stack traces, etc.) more time simply waiting for grep to run.

Fed guidance says 0% CPI growth. I have income $10 (note that NGDP is aggregate nominal income). I sign a deal with you for you to finance my house and promise you for $7 next year, assuming I""ll live off of $3.<p>Now a supply shock hits, with enough pressure to raise CPI to 110. The fed responds by dropping NGDP so now national income is $90 (I know the math here isn't exact but it's irrelevant to the point). If I'm the average person, I take a 10% income hit, dropping me to $9. I still owe you $7. My consumption now has to drop from $3 to $2, a 50% drop! I might not be able to do it so I might default on my loan. In any case I'm really screwed, and if I do default (and many other people also default) we'll have a financial crisis <i>on top</i> of our supply shock. One way to think about this is that the debtor has to eat the creditor's consumption haircut. Europe, cough cough.<p>In contrast, under NGDP targeting, NGDP remains the same, prices rise 10%. Now my income will still be $10, I will pay my creditor $7, and my only hit is the 10% inflation. My creditor has the same exposure.<p>I'm not trying to create sympathy for debtors, of course you could argue that they were over-leveraged and deserved what they got.

I've been in this business for 8 years, seen a dozen products (HW/SW/Apps) go through FDA/CE approval and end up on store shelves. I co-designed the only product at the Apple retail stores that use blood as a user interface. Most engineers/product people in the industry share your frustration. We're keenly aware of the problems, but it's a problem with the ecosystem and hard to solve at a startup scale.<p>Basically, we're seeing little movement because open data has huge perceived risks and minute upside.<p>+ Open Data = Risk: The reason big device companies don't make open APIs for data is that it opens them up to risk. If some 3rd party creates software that uses device data and a patient ends up in a hospital, or worse, who will the family sue? The 2 person startup experimenting with health software, or the multi-billion dollar device company that didn't police every app made with their data? It's slightly irrational, but from the perspective of device company execs, opening data creates huge potential problems and risks with almost no upside. Also, the data privacy laws in the US and Europe scare/confuse many.<p>+ Open data attracts almost no customers: Unfortunately, there is no real money making/saving opportunity with data. A lot of promising concepts, but until there is a business model, there won't be a huge amount of focus on this area. Once there is, it will explode.<p>+ People won't pay for better products: Most people with diabetes have multiple meters, most of which they receive for free. The device companies work on a razors and blades model so are incented to keep costs down and use retrograde technology. When companies try to make higher quality products, relatively few people buy them.<p>So the best selling market today is a product that was originally designed to be a disposable meter for use in the 3rd world. It's super cheap and does the job while some of the awesome products you mentioned flounder.<p>Diabetes, and healthcare generally is a hugely complex market. The web of stakeholders blows the minds of most people who enter it. It will change eventually, but it's extremely difficult to bring a startup mentality to the industry because it usually requires thinking about physical manufacturing AND opening your company up to regulation AND operating in a Byzantine payment system.

If you are a developer you need to know your OS.<p>> I'm not sure use of a partition table editor should be a requirement for using Dropbox safely.<p>It isn't, but if you are smart you'll take my advice and go implement it right now.<p>> Most people use the operating system that came installed on their PC as-is.<p>Developers are not ""most people"" and should certainly not behave as such.  Your data is the only thing that is important.  Your work product.  Investing in separate drivers (not partitions, separate physical drives) on every development machine is invaluable.  And, backing-them up with disk images on a daily basis is just as important.  If the system drive goes out your data is intact.  If the data drive goes out the system is intact.  Recovery is an academic exercise.  If both drives go out it is a little more of a pain in the ass, but at most you'll loose a day's worth of work, not a lifetime or a whole year's worth.<p>> Dropbox makes the following claims on their website:<p>Pardon the raw-ness:  I don't give a shit of what anyone says or claims about any service. Neither should you or any serious developer.  You, and only you are responsible for the safety of your data.  You HAVE TO assume failures, not just locally, but also remotely.  Hardware fails.  Software fucks-up.  Even if Dropbox (or name your service) guaranteed 500% redundancy I'd still have my own backups.  It would be irresponsible to do otherwise.<p>Then there's the practicality of the whole thing.  The machine I am using to type this has the following physical drives (not partitions on a single drive, these are independent pieces of hardware in the chassis):<p><pre><code>    Internal backup drive\n    External backup drive (USB)\n    System drive\n    Data\n    Library\n    Development\n</code></pre>\nThe last four are backed-up daily with incremental backups to both backup drives.<p>The data drive alone has over 300GB of data right now.  The Library and Development drives are about 150GB of data each. That's 600GB of valuable work in three drives probably representing millions of dollars of work-product and value.<p>So, Dropbox is backup, right?  Well, uploading 600GB to your ""backup"" would take somewhere in the order of 100 days of continuous 24/7 upload with my current DSL connection (~600Kbps upload speed). That's a third of a year.  Nope, it's not backup.",1356380590

4963954,comment,4962366,4963741,3,0,Firehed,,,"When the actual logic resides deep in a call stack, it's more difficult to debug code, much less bring on new developers.  Each additional abstraction layer is, unsurprisingly, another layer that you're going to have to trace through to get at the root of the issue.<p>Similarly, when your logic doesn't reside at the root level, it's easy to accidentally bypass. Perhaps this is intentional, but I'd argue that intentionally bypassing certain logic under certain conditions indicates your logic is poorly factored.  My most common example to this is an admin panel: admins can, as an example, change any user's name, not just their own. However, this only holds true when in the admin panel. So in your user controller, you have some sort of permission check ensuring that the user being operated on is the one authenticated[1], but intentionally don't place that check in your admin controller. One day in the name of a better UX you add an AJAX component to this, and forget to copy across that check into the ajax endpoint. Suddenly I can change anyone's username, despite not being an admin.<p>To solve this, we've created a couple of libraries: PermissionCheck and AuthContext; the former (typically) depends on the latter. AuthContext answers the questions of who are you (authentication) and where are you (context), and the permission check wraps up the authorization component: in the (web frontend | api | admin panel | cronjob | upgrade script) does the currently authenticated user have permission to do X on object Y?  By putting these checks in the models, it's easy to ensure they're always enforced (a user's updateName method may call checkUpdateName()->enforce() ); if you want to side-step (or ramp up) authorization under a certain context, you edit the model's permission check for that action, rather than one or more controllers.<p>Could you put that into a different helper library? Probably, if you were so inclined. However, that leaves you with at least two files to check when you want to examine behavior, and an inability to use any protected or private methods from these permission checks.<p>Having an object that does a lot of stuff is not necessarily the much-feared ""God object"", although it certainly can become that. I've learned to become more fearful of the ""God methods"" instead; having 300 10-line methods doesn't concern me nearly as much as 10 300-line methods. Breaking code apart simply because you want a smaller file means you have a crappy text editor. Break code apart when it's logically doing more than it should be doing, or is poorly encapsulated.<p>This is, to a limited degree, an issue I have with mocking in unit tests: while great in theory (test components individually and trust that your interfaces/contracts/whatever ensure that A and B independently working mean that in production they will work together), in practice the two components do have a dependency on each other, and it's exceedingly difficult to reproduce production issues because of that fake isolation. How many ways have you seen an external API fail? Have you reproduced those failure modes in your mock, and have you written tests against each one of those different modes? Maybe it's the industry I'm in (payments), but in a world made of edge cases, effectively squaring the number of scenarios I have to test is not a pleasant experience.<p>/edit - forgot my footnote :)\n[1] In practice, a user controller will hopefully tend to always operate on the currently-authenticated user, rather than passing around a userId by whatever means. However I've seen the latter done, and this exact kind of problem is what ensued.",1356380477

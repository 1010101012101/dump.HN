However takeover or bankruptcy of the vendor will let you claim the code under a GPL-type license from third party escrow.<p>Some of the peace of mind of OSS, but a decent revenue model for the vendor.

I'm not keen on through-the-web code development but that's not essential to web2py -- everything can be edited directly as simple files.  The code of the 'gluon' library seems fine to me.  It's a very compact style of coding that (IMO) could use a few more comments, but it's at least as good as what I've seen in Zope and Plone.  (Of course, web2py has not been around long enough to accumulate the kind of cruft that happens in more aged software).  The documentation is pretty good, particularly in its examples and tutorials.  The new ""manual"" is good.  The one thing is miss is an API manual such as can be found for the PHP and Python libraries.",1209415289

Then they'd call me up or something and bother me about it. Even my mom sent emails to the .com address.<p>Eventually I gave up and got another name that ended in .com, and I haven't had problems yet. Plus, it's something fairly memorable (if you know me) and also the first few google results for the name :D<p>I suppose the big problem is that even with the big name sites (del.icio.us comes to mind), some people have a hard time remembering ""delicious"" as being del.icio.us and instead go to delicious.com (I think I even heard something about them changing the main site address to .com...edit: it was from a TC article about the new preview.). It's been too ingrained into people's heads. It's probably not going to change anytime soon.<p>edit the second because it just popped up in my head: I might note this probably depends on where you live (or more specifically, where your visitors live). .com seems to be the default TLD people think of (sometimes the only one) in the US. Meanwhile it's not necessarily the case e.g. in South Korea, where .co.kr is just as well known as .com, et cetera.<p>edit the third because I haven't fully woken up yet (although it's 1pm PDT): I'm the general computer person for a small nonprofit in Southern California. We have a .org address, and you'd imagine it would be appropriate to use a .org address and that people would remember it. Nope. We're now considering buying the .com and redirecting to the .org because people have trouble associating a .org with an organization.",1209412927

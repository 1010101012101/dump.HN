This change really only inconveniences the uber-geeks among us.""</i><p>It's not just DIY'ers. It's the secondary service and repair market. Now they have to buy Apple disks.<p>I'll  suggest that it is a fundamental business strategy for Apple to seek to extract a transaction cost from any exchange involving their products. iTunes was the pivot point for their revenue model. The iPhone transferred it to hardware and scaled it for content, e.g. batteries and the AppStore. The past year has seen it rolled out widely for the Mac platform. One gets the sense that they look at the profit which companies like Macsales.com earn from upgrades as money that has been left on the table - certainly it is consistent with their recent policies regarding sales from within apps.",1305226585

2541852,comment,2541189,2541778,19,0,_delirium,,,"I'm mostly interested in looking at the problems with the U.S.'s prison system before North Korea's because it is: 1) exceedingly bad; and 2) nearby enough that there is some chance we (=Americans) can do something about it. ""North Korea is really bad"" by contrast, I already believe, and we have a ton of evidence for it. Is evidence that North Korean prisons are also big and inhumane surprising? Yes, we should do something about it if possible, but we've been at a loss for decades about what to do about it; it's not like we haven't already been trying to pressure the regime there, and get rid of it if possible.<p>The U.S. system is not just ""too-strict sentencing guidelines"" either; the prevalence of rape makes it imo basically an inhumane system. The government will not usually <i>actually</i> rape you (though rape by prison guards is also a problem), but it will put you in conditions that it has known for decades are likely to cause you to be raped. It continues to maintain those conditions and knowingly forces people into them, in effect (probabilistically) sentencing them to be raped. And regular Americans on the street will joke about ""pound-you-in-the-ass prisons"" or ""hope you like the butt sex!"", apparently considering this an <i>appropriate</i>, perhaps even good, way to punish criminals, since it adds to the deterrence factor by making the prospect of going to a prison with such conditions a frightening one.<p>I guess we can make some hierarchy, where maintaining a prison system filled with starving inmates is worse than a rape-filled prison, which is in turn worse than a merely filthy/diseased prison, but it seems sort of pointless to justify things that way. I'd just go after the closest inhumane prison system, which I don't have to travel far to find. (It's also not purely a left-right thing; the left probably talks about it more, and the ""tough-on-crime"" right downplays the U.S.'s prison conditions, but it's also become a popular cause among Christian groups lately.)",1305226410

They want to lead their own platform somewhere else, fine, just do it. Don't pretend that you've been pushed to.<p>The Gnome Zeitgeist project originated from the Ubuntu community and at first they weren't accepted for inclusion in the project and started to whine in a very ubuntuesque way. They weren't listening at all to the maintainer's rationale for rejection. Happily at some point they started to listen and will probably be a key piece of GNOME 3.2<p>Now, I can't say the same for some others projects from canonical. challenging upstream is one thing, not being open to dialogue another, pushing its agenda by FUDing another beast altogether.<p>As for removing features ... what are talking about ? GNOME 3.0 ? It's not like it is a finished and dead product that won't evolve anymore ! Bulkier controls ?! Come man, just change your theme. Increased screen resolution ?

3806317,comment,3805635,3805954,2,0,ghshephard,,,"I believe that apps are deal breakers in two different ways.  First, for some small percentage (10%?  20%?) of the Smartphone buying community, they really want particular apps in order to be productive.  Whether it's WhatsApp, Skype, Adobe Sketch, iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, Instagram, Path, etc.. - if the platform doesn't have _their_ favorite/desired/needed app, they will be unproductive/unhappy, and as such, won't chose that platform.<p>The second, much larger category of people, consists of those who, as you said, probably won't be inconvenienced by that missing app - but they don't want to be seen making a bad decision.  These are the people who either are afraid of having purchased the ""wrong"" (whatever that means) device, or are worried about missing out on future benefits from their platform when developers don't roll out the AAA titles for it.<p>There is a reason why App developers pick and chose their platform.  There is a reason why, my poor friends with Blackberry Bold's are getting almost NO application support from developers.  My mother complains a little about how her HTC Desire HD lags behind my iPhone on some features or capabilities of some apps, but, nine times out of ten these days, the cool new app that I'm using on my iPhone is not (and probably never will be) available for the Blackberry.<p>So, the average user is actually smart to avoid these ""dead end"" platforms.  They realize that, while there may not be a killer app that they need right now, if they truly want to enjoy the ""App Ecosystem"" - they need to chose a device that will get great developer support.<p>And right now, that is IOS first, Android Second, and, if Microsoft has anything to say about it, WP7 third.<p>Blackberry and Symbian are basically dead as far as App Development goes, and, as their Applications die up on the vine, their users are flocking away.<p>Some users see this as an opportunity, because with no competition, they have a much easier time making themselves seen, and (for the limited audience that they have), have a better chance of making revenue.<p>But that's from the _DEVELOPERS_ perspective.  From the _USERS_ perspective, they could care less whether the individual developer is able to make a lot of money - all they care about is whether the World Class Apps are available for their platform.<p>I guess this is a long way of me saying I disagree with your thesis that Applications aren't critical to the success of a platform.  Without the App developers, the platform will die.  Microsoft realizes this.",1333697556

3806295,comment,3795513,3805533,1,0,6ren,,,"Striking some chords, I've thought on these issues too.<p><i>software systems sustainably over time</i><p>Aside: the related idea of <i>business</i> sustainability is a business issue, not a technical issue (to do with customer needs and competitors both changing over time). Clayton Christensen sees high-tech as going through phases favouring performance, reliability, convenience then price over time - what wins one phase won't necessarily win the next.
Warren Buffet sticks with low-tech (like a brick maker) because slow change enables advantages to be more sustainable over time.<p><i>reductio of wildly inflated complexity and that it's possible to do orders of magnitude better</i><p>Yes, their performance sucks, and also distorts the right way to do things (like the MS framework example). But does it depend on which ""better"" we mean? If better means ""time to market"", then the present stack is better... I respect much of what Alan Kay has said and done but note he's never had business success.<p><i>Not by persuading others to do it but by just doing it.</i><p>Yes, I think so too. :-)<p><i>It's not just the medium, but how we're using it.</i><p>I think it's specific abstractions, that suit the problems people are facing - and I think we're making steady progress. From arithmetic, function invocation, namespacing, way up to standard libraries (consider in sequence those of: C, C++, Java, Python) and now web-based APIs. Like scientific progress, it's not one single theory, but a great many specific facts and theories. Each a mysterious journey and heroic victory in itself.<p>BTW: There's that idea of using the analogue behaviour of transistors directly, instead of going through circuits, microcode, compilers and programs to simulate them... amazing performance, but hard to manage.<p><i>build valuable systems with drastically less code</i><p>I think libraries. e.g. we can make a valuable website very little code with sinatra (or PHP). That means we're there already :-).  I know you're concerned with how to measure the length, and should it include libraries, but I think that if the abstraction suits your problem, it does not introduce unnecessary complexity into your code - and so I'm happy to consider it as part of the platform and ignore its actual cost. I'm not sure how to justify that, but it seems intuitively right to me (like not worrying how long code is in the implementation of arithmetic - I understand the IEEE fp spec is huge). Perhaps because that's the kind of library I'd write if I did the whole thing from scratch.<p>I think this is the nub of our impasse: I'm fixated on clean abstractions, and you're concerned about measuring program length. I think clean abstractions don't <i>contaminate</i> your code with complexity from another level - so you can pretend to start fresh in a new world. Ray Kurzweil suggests this happens with technological innovation, and even in biology e.g. tweaking DNA, cells, multicellular body plans, behaviour etc rather than inventing alternatives from scratch. Similar to SOTSOG.<p>A source of facts: ARM is a new stack compared to x86; and iOS is a new stack compared with desktop OS. Is there progress? They seem better (more efficient, smaller), but using the same fundamentals. Those Forth chips are <i>totally</i> different though.<p>BTW: do you have a link for the ideas about complexity from Kay at VPRI? I looked at their website, but couldn't see anything directly on it - and didn't want to download a bunch of pdfs to search for it. :-)",1333696581

My preference is for Karl Marx and Henry George (with the former being better at seeing what capitalism really is, and the latter being the better economist).<p>><i>Your problem seems to be that you haven't considered the possibility that academia is even worse. Academia is even worse. (I dropped out of the Berkeley PhD program in 1992 - specialty, OS and languages. From what I can tell, academia has only gotten worse since then.)</i><p>This is precisely what I was considering at the end of undergrad.  Hell, I'm in basically the same specialty as you were.<p>><i>Even if you want to be a bureaucrat, there's no guarantee that you'll be good at it. Good bureaucrats don't write posts like the one you just wrote. They don't antagonize anyone, ever, in any way. They would rather lie - and they do. Are you good at that?</i><p>Cool story, bro.  Do you think I didn't consider the office-political implications of what I wrote?<p>* Most academics don't read Hacker News.<p>* Most academics would perceive this as on their side.<p>* I openly admit that I wrote the post not even with mere bias but with an active bent towards an overly-negative portrayal of reality.<p>* Most start-up folks here on Hacker News don't necessarily agree in whole, but agree in part.  I've seen Steve Yegge's speech referenced a disturbing number of times on Reddit and HN.<p>* Most of the votes have been upvotes, indicating a perception that the discussion is worth having rather than storming off in a huff and blacklisting the offending poster.<p>><i>You think someone is going to fund you just because you're smart and have cool ideas?</i><p>No, I thought someone was going to fund me because my adviser is well-known and prestigious within the field.  There's no point breeding inferior academic DNA into myself, is there?<p>><i>Otherwise, the simplest way to do the kind of research you want to do is to decide quite consciously to give yourself over to the salt-mining industry in the most mercenary possible way, spend a decade making as much money as you possibly can (and spending as little as you can), and (if you succeed) found your own little university of one. It's not Victorian science, either, but I'll tell you it's a lot closer than Berkeley.</i><p>For my field I never even saw any point in applying to Berkeley, but how do you propose to go about this?  Even the successful industrial programmers I know, unless they became millionaires off a start-up, did not actually make enough money to ""settle down"" out of working and ""found your own little university of one.""<p>Provided you had the cash, it does sound like a fine idea.",1333695816

As a front-end developer I get excited about this stuff, but I just do not see what T3 brings to the table that other frameworks do not.<p>I appreciate that Box have released T3 for free and if people want to use, well then that&#x27;s great. Nobody is being forced to use it, but it is situations like these where I can&#x27;t help but wonder if efforts might have been better spent contributing to an existing open source project instead?<p>To me this looks very similar to AngularJS (albeit a little more stripped down). Looking at their example code, it just feels like they&#x27;ve made their own ES6 modules/class implementation. A better choice in my opinion would have been to take the same path that Rob Eisenberg with Aurelia has taken by making the framework ES6 and then providing Gulp and Babel to transpile it. T3 feels similar to AngularJS in that you spend an exorbitant amount of time writing class-like modules when ES6 and transpilers already give us a cleaner standards based approach.<p>I do not want to sound negative, I am just offering constructive criticism. I would love to hear the thoughts of the Box team as to why something like React.js would not have worked for them instead. Considering React.js promotes modular component development like T3 does, it makes me question if Box needed to build T3 when React.js and its similar MVC-less approach is the same. It is cool they did and it takes dedication and work to build a Javascript framework, but I feel like perhaps it is wasted effort.",1429138799
9384827,comment,9384013,9384653,0,0,jccooper,,,"Stage separation is somewhere around 100km and Mach 6 or more. The exact figures will depend on the mission profile.<p>There&#x27;s a &quot;boostback burn&quot; at altitude to slow the horizontal velocity right after separation, an entry burn to put it into the atmosphere, and a landing burn just before it hits the deck. The guidance in between those last two burns is aerodynamic from the grid fins.<p>The first stage mass is ~18,000kg empty (which it nearly is on landing), and it&#x27;s coming in at its terminal velocity, which is, as a WAG, maybe 70m/s.<p>What&#x27;s more, it cannot hover, as even one engine has a greater thrust at minimum throttle than the rocket weighs. So it must do what SpaceX calls a &quot;hover-slam&quot;, and reduce its velocity vectors to 0 at the same moment its altitude gets to 0 in a single burn. Burn too short, you crash, burn too long, you go back up (and then crash.) And the horizontal vectors also need to be very small, and you can&#x27;t end up too tilted either, or you fall over. And explode, because you&#x27;re a thin-shelled tube with plenty of fuel and oxidizer still left. Oh, and you have to hit a very small target within a couple meters.<p>So it&#x27;s a pretty tricky task. Plenty of rockets can hover these days, but landing a full-sized launch stage coming in from the edge of space is pretty tricky. And they almost got it. Looks like it overreacted just a hair to a gust of wind or something.<p>Your solution has two problems: (1) it cannot hover and (2) you&#x27;d have to design and build and test big robot arms. And put them everywhere you want to land. It&#x27;s probably easier to make your big robot spacecraft, which you already have, do the landing itself on a plain concrete pad.",1429138798
9384826,comment,9380962,9380962,0,0,interesting_att,,,"People forget that Mayer acquired 56 companies (57 if Foursquare deal goes through). That is, 41% of all of Yahoo&#x27;s acquisitions over the past 20 years happened in the last 3 years. Think it is important to analyze this Foursquare deal the context of this yet-to-be-proven strategy.<p>Back to this deal: Interesting possibility, for sure. Will it work out? Who knows with Yahoo.<p>Foursquare assets:<p><pre><code>     1) Brand name with both consumers and businesses

     2) 45m daily active users

     3) Valuable data- Can improve Yahoo Search, Yahoo ads, etc

     4) Large group of domain experts

</code></pre>
Yahoo&#x27;s value add:<p><pre><code>     1) Yahoo does have a strong ad sales department, so it can bring lots of brand names to Foursquare

     2) Can heavily integrate Foursquare into its search features- so Foursquare&#x27;s DAU can stabilize/grow.

</code></pre>
Seems like Mayer&#x27;s strategy is:<p>1) Buy her way out of changing Yahoo&#x27;s employees + culture. This is a longer term play.<p>2) Try to create some constellation of a platform. Ideal world for Mayer would be:<p><pre><code>     a) Get your homepage to be Yahoo

     b) Read the latest trending headlines via Yahoo media 

     c) Yahoo stories pump up Yahoo-owned Tumblr blogs, Yahoo-owned Flickr photo sharing, etc

     d) After that, you search for things on Yahoo. The search would ideally share information coming from Foursquare.
</code></pre>
The big thing is on execution and that&#x27;s why people constantly criticize Yahoo. If they do actually make a sensible platform, expect Mayer to be viewed very positively.",1429138787

The most common side effect is muscle twitches or headaches. Headaches are caused by a reduction of the amount of choline, and eating eggs or taking a choline supplement makes the headache go away. Generally the twitches are not severe and don&#x27;t affect voluntary movements. The side effects subside upon stopping. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a completely different effect than caffeine, as it allows me to concentrate for extended periods and have instant recall. If it is a placebo effect, then whatever it is, it works. Placebo effect means there is an effect because there is expected to be one, so in any case it&#x27;s useful. Piracetam&#x27;s effects on the body are well documented, since it&#x27;s been in use for about 35 years now. That said, I don&#x27;t think this gives you any more rest, nor does taking it make it so you can&#x27;t sleep.

9384792,comment,9383905,9383905,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"I don&#x27;t know how a person can write about the Kaiser and not even mention once Edwards the 7th. He was the Kaiser&#x27;s uncle and one of the most manipulative forces upon him. I would say the Kaiser was one of those people who didn&#x27;t have the chops to function properly in his position, and wasn&#x27;t very powerful at all in the leadership sense of the word. What really gets me is that this is the backdrop for the entire mess we have found ourselves in since the beginning of the 20th century. Take note of such connections in the following text from Webster Tarpley&#x27;s &quot;King Edward VII of Great Britain: Evil Demiurge of the Triple Entente and World War 1&quot;<p>&quot;Edward’s mastery of psychological and ideological manipulation is most evident in his relation with his pathetic and unstable nephew, Kaiser Wilhelm. Edward made a detailed study of Willy’s psychological profile, which he knew to be pervaded by feelings of inferiority and incurable anglophilia. As Flourens noted: “Edward VII made an in-depth study of the defects of Wilhelm II. He counted them as his most precious allies.” (Flourens, p. 58)<p>The British and Entente demonization of Wilhelm as the world’s chief warmonger was always absurd. Wilhelm felt inferior to British royalty. Wilhelm’s greatest secret desire was for acceptance by the British royals. Edward could modulate his own behavior to get the desired result from the Kaiser. If he wanted a public tantrum, he could get that. One British writer, Legge, reports that Edward punched the Kaiser and knocked him down in a meeting.<p>But if Edward needed to be friendly, he could do that too. During the Boer War, in November 1899, when Britain’s diplomatic isolation was at its height, Edward was able to con the Kaiser into making a state visit to Britain. The Boxer Rebellion in China, with its overtone of white racial solidarity against the “yellow peril,” was also made to order for duping the Kaiser. In Wilhelm’s dockside harangue to the German contingent setting out for Peking, he urged his soldiers on to cruelty against the Chinese:<p>“Give no quarter! Take no prisoners! Kill him when he falls into your hands! Even as, a thousand years ago, the Huns under their King Attila made such a name for themselves as still resounds in terror through legend and fable, so may the name of Germans resound through Chinese history a thousand years from now.” (Cowles, p. 177) This “Huns” speech has provided grist for the London propaganda mill for almost a century, from World War I to the Margaret Thatcher- Nicholas Ridley “Fourth Reich” hysteria of 1989. Not just once, but again and again, the Kaiser muffed opportunities to checkmate Edward’s plans.<p>Edward also played on the Kaiser to sabotage the Berlin to Baghdad railway. At Windsor Castle in 1907, Edward demanded that the British keep control of a section of the railway between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf as a “gate,” supposedly to block German troops going to India. The Kaiser was ready to grant such a gate. Otherwise, Edward demanded that all talks about the Baghdad railway should be four-way, with France, Russia, Britain, and Germany involved, so that German proposals would always be voted down 3 to 1.<p>When the war was finally over, and the Kaiser had lost his throne, the first thing he wanted in exile from the Dutch host was a cup of real English tea.<p>Edward joked with his French friends that while many prayed to an eternal father, he alone seemed to have an eternal mother. Queen Victoria finally died in 1901, and Edward began his drive to world war.&quot;",1429138296

Energy capacity may range from 4 to 16 hours duration at full power output.&quot;<p>The 3GW is big but the duration is small, so I&#x27;d guess they&#x27;re doing short term grid stabilization, competing more with flywheels than hydro. That&#x27;s just a hunch, but if that were true, it&#x27;d explain how you could get something really effective without a lake-sized train. (Some videos online suggest they move a bunch of heavy cars on the same track independently, so they probably also get much more weight than a normal train.)<p>My limited understanding of pumped hydro specifically was that it really was basically just a turbine operating in two directions, crazy as that sounds. Even so though, I can easily imagine big cost savings just from not having to engineer around water. That stuff doesn&#x27;t compress, you design or run these wrong and they&#x27;ll just mercilessly explode:

Pretty much any new grid storage technology is going to add to the field rather than displacing anything, because the grid needs arbitrage in basically all 18 different dimensions.<p>Thanks for the link.

There was a guy at work who insisted on using .format() for everything that soured me on it, sometimes even simple string concatenation:<p><pre><code>    print &#x27;result: {long_var_name}&#x27;.format({long_var_name=long_var_name})

Sometimes lines reached 200 chars.  If lines were broken down, they might extend to 4 lines for each debug statement, adding tons of clutter.  Said it was more readable because you could ignore the end. :/<p>As sago said, printf is more concise in the majority of use cases.  Not to mention the logging niceties:<p><pre><code>    log.info(&#x27;result: %s %s&#x27;, one, two)  # shorter and note that fmt is deferred!
</code></pre>
A _big_ one in my eyes.  Too bad logging doesn&#x27;t support {} internally.<p>I&#x27;ve also wondered if .format could be improved if the % operator could be used with it, given appropriate precedence rules.

The fact that runs in the JVM, a Virtual Machine with 20 years of development, improvements and optimizations, is almost a killer reason to pick Scala. I worked with Java/Spring/Hibernate in the past, a very frustrating experience, but Scala changed my mind about the JVM and opened a completely new world: Functional Programming. Now I know and use concepts like Monoids, Monads, Future/Promises, Reactive Programming, Actor Model, Duality, etc... without any problem. It&#x27;s a complete different world and I think it deserves a shot.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/</a>",1429137415

Most U.S. states still recognize a common law name change or assumed name.<p>If James McGill uses the name &quot;Saul Goodman&quot; openly and notoriously in the course of his business, he could reasonably use either name, or both, to identify himself.  It is literally just that simple.  Your name is whatever you use as your name.  If you are a corporation, you may need to file a &quot;doing business as&quot; document with the state business registration authority, but natural persons can merely start introducing themselves with the new name.  I could start calling myself &quot;Master President Jack Redbull Walks-Away-From-Explosions Cartman the 42nd&quot;, in addition to my birth name and my HN handle, and lo, that would be my name.<p>As such, the &quot;proof&quot; would be as simple as solemnizing an affidavit that you are not using the name for any malicious purpose.<p>Requiring an ID--or more specifically, a state-issued ID--is much more burdensome.  The state, you see, has a selfish interest in being able to link all of the names a person may have, such that it is easier to enforce its laws upon that person.<p>I could not go to the state&#x27;s ID-issuing agency and get an ID card featuring the name &quot;Master President Jack Redbull Walks-Away-From-Explosions Cartman the 42nd&quot;.  The bureaucrat on site would rather tiresomely insist upon knowing the boring old name that my parents gave to me, and adamantly maintain that the state will officially recognize only one name at a time, that requires a form to be filled out and authorized by a probate judge, and the new name wouldn&#x27;t fit on the card anyway, and would have to be abbreviated to &quot;[Mr.] Master P. Cartman, 42nd&quot;.<p>This common law tradition allows a person to use an assumed name or pseudonym for travel, without the expectation that the traveler be <i>authorized</i> in any way.

We do get thousands of applications and make time to hop on calls to make sure the companies are viable and have cool teams. We end up choosing around 10%-15% of those who apply.<p>Regarding registration; Physical space at any conference would come at a premium. As advertised, we&#x27;re removing this element of the cost to startups who could bring value to the event and charging a fee for tickets & registration. The package grants you 3 tickets (2 day event and evening socials), online circulation, access to industry leader talks, workshops, investor office hours & invitations to partner activations as well as the physical space in your chosen industry area. Our website clearly states that there is a cost associated with registering. Our event isn&#x27;t free but you can see by the calibre of attendee and speakers (as outlined in the website) that there are definite opportunities and knowledge to be gained.<p>The event was really well received last year and more than half the participating startups either joined us at Web Summit and/or are returning to Collision this year. For me personally, that is a great testament to the event. We are working tirelessly to improve our systems to make sure everyone gets value from the event. We&#x27;re a tech startup ourselves and we just want to put on an awesome tech event.<p>Happy to answer any more questions.

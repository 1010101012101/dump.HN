Elephants grow up in structured societies, where older elephants teach younger ones proper behavior. Because of culling (a sterile word, if ever there was one!) and the elimination of older elephants, younger members of the herd (1) have not had the chance to learn proper behavior, and (2) suffer traumatic grief early in life. Hence the rampages. Very humanlike, indeed. (Lord of the Flies, anyone?)",1204732348

129713,comment,129407,129555,0,0,tel,,,"Of course avoiding tables doesn't automatically make things accessible. It makes it <i>possible</i> to be accessible.<p>Accessibility is tricky. For instance, one of the largest things that HTML tables break is the linear flow of the page. For people using screen readers or text-only browsers it becomes far, far more difficult to understand the content of a page.<p>CSS tables can be applied with consideration only against the hierarchal structure of the page allowing you to write pages that are accessibly legible yet stylish.<p>That is unless you want to make whole new versions of your site for any number of accessibility domains: modern browsers, IE 6-, blind people, lynx, mobile browsers, mobile safari, colorblind people, &c. Good luck with SEO on all of those, too.",1204731392

129711,comment,129121,129401,0,0,ovi256,,,"I have only used Django, Rails, CakePHP and raw PHP.  \nDjango has a superb ORM layer (beats Rails 10-0), where relations are really well implemented, as members of the model. Selects are easy, and can be chained (as filters). In Rails (even 2.0) I had to use find(:all, condition => <SQL fragment>. That is so not hiding the db layer.\nGenerally, there is much less to none auto-magic. This is a thing I quite disliked in Rails, both as a beginner and beyond. I like to keep most things explicit. I find it baffling that Rails is considered easy to understand. Due to the auro-magic, I found the learning curve pretty steep.",1204731041

129708,comment,129517,129517,0,0,msluyter,,,"Here's a take from an ex-classical musician, now software engineer:<p>Making a living in the arts is excruciating. Classical musicians today tend to live in an unstable patchwork of part-time gigs, private teaching, side jobs lacking health insurance, etc... and that's if they're lucky. Only a few manage to obtain full time jobs. As others have noted, the day to day life of a musician isn't as glamorous as it might seem. I loved Beethoven's 5th as a child; but after <i>playing</i> it for the N-teenth time, I began to see how a career in music could grow tedious.<p>When I decided to go into CS it was because I realized that the people who had successful music careers tended to be a.) either so insanely talented that it was obvious they'd be catapulted into the inner circle (eg, full time gigs) fairly easily or b.) so monomaniacal in their dedication to their craft that they simply had no other choice. Anything other than being a musician would have meant having to curl up and die.<p>Since I was neither of those, I decided to turn to something that'd I'd been quite good at in high school (math/science) and rather enjoyed, and I would describe myself as much happier now. Vastly happier, <i>and</i> financially secure. Music is still a part of my life as a fulfilling hobby.<p>Whatever you decide, I'd highly recommend reading Daniel Gilbert's ""Stumbling on Happiness,"" before making any irrevocable decisions. Gilbert is a psychologist whose research suggests that people are generally extremely bad at predicting the future and figuring out what actually will make them happy. It's a cautionary tale for anyone who might think ""If only I could do X I'd be happy..."" Follow that with ""How to Want What You Have,"" by Timothy Ray Miller, and you have a prescription for happiness.",1204730742

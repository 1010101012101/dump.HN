So the line is really whether or not the engine has a separate cooling loop, usually filled with water.<p>There are a couple different temperatures to speak of.  There is the overall engine temp, which may well be very similar to a modern engine.  But there is also the temperature of the cylinder walls deep inside.  An air-cooled engine relies on metal to conduct heat away from the heart of the engine.  A water-cooled engine puts a pipe of cold water right alongside the cylinders to physically move heat away.  So the internals of an air-cooled engine go through a much wider temperature range during normal operation.  With differential metals that means gaps... gaps between the cylinder wall and the piston.  That in turn means increased wear and emission-related problems.  An air-cooled engine is willing to suffer these issues for the advantage of decreased weight and complexity.  An air-cooled engine not willing to suffer this internal heating would be a very slow and heavy engine.<p>Having a hotter cylinder wall can also impact choice of fuels (need higher octane) and compression ratios (need less) as the hot walls might ignite things before the spark.",1440373673

We were the first group of Americans allowed into the Udmurt region, and we traveled from Saint Petersburg to Izhevsk to meet our host families for a short stay, and then to Moscow before leaving the country. It was the first time in my life when I saw anything like that. I remember a few times when I said things that I still cringe at saying to this day. Prior to entering Russia, we stayed in Stockholm. Stockholm was a shining jewel compared to Saint Petersburg, which itself was a shining jewel compared to Izhevsk. I remember I asked out loud if a hotel was going to &quot;be like Sweden&quot;, completely oblivious that I was embarrassing the Americans and Russians around me. Things like this that still make me cringe today. The city of Izhevsk was famous for being the home of the inventor of the AK-47, as well as the Baikal munitions plant, which supplied a lot of the world&#x27;s Soviet ammunition. I remember seeing a group of children, perhaps six or seven years old, running through the street and drinking from a bottle of vodka. A few months later, our Russian host-family counterparts came to stay with us in the States for about as long as we were in Russia. My grandmother gave me a hundred dollars (kind of a big deal in &#x27;93 heh) to take my counterpart shopping. When we were at the store, I remember talking about buying some toys and taking my counterpart to the toy section at Walmart. You know what he did instead? He bought Levis and cans of coffee for his family.

I&#x27;ve got tons of sheet music in a Windows 3.1-era notation program that I can&#x27;t get out, because it&#x27;s stored in a binary format and there&#x27;s no built-in exporter.<p>Second, APIs for web services actually <i>do</i> support lots of this. I have a very tiny script taking all my Foursquare checkins and sending them to a private Slack, for instance. I wrote the script. I didn&#x27;t need approval from Foursquare or Slack.<p>I wonder if the author has actually tried using any APIs. The fact that <i>some</i> &#x27;90s desktop apps were easily scriptable and <i>some</i> &#x27;10s web services aren&#x27;t scriptable has nothing to do with them being desktop apps or web services.<p>(Not to mention most &#x27;10s web services being <i>scrapable</i>.

Last reliable numbers put us in order of 90% of everything we consume is either imported or requires imported material to produce. 2- The lack of enough cash to import either consumers goods or prime materials to produce 3- The irresponsible printing of inorganic Bolivares.<p>Any short of resetting the economy, which may or may not include dollarization (or eurozation), is useless at this point, but once we are done with that, it will take maybe 3 years or less to sort this mess.",1440370989

There&#x27;s much more to it than I know for sure, but certainly feels like it has to share resources with itself as well as anything else running.

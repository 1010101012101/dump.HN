If 5 guys down the block are all charging less than half your price and you have a harder time getting clients, it is YOUR fault for not proving your value. As brands, Cadillac, BMW and Volvo do very well. They charge a lot of money for their products in a space where others sell their products for less than half the price. You need to build your brand and prove your worth to your potential clients, assuming your work is as good as your prices indicate.

Let's dispatch them:<p><i>If H.264 support is being removed to “enable open innovation”, will Flash Player support be dropped as well? If not, why?</i><p>The premise is that openness is all or nothing. But Google can support Flash and work towards openness, just as Apple can prefer open web standards in lieu of Flash while supporting proprietary systems. There's no hypocrisy or conflict.<p><i>Android currently supports H.264. Will this support be removed from Android?</i><p>Maybe in the future. WebM support is new in Android, hardware decoders are really just coming to market, and there are enough existing and in-production phones that rely on H.264. The constraints placed on Google by the handful of Chrome users leveraging H.264 HTML5 video is completely unlike the realities of dealing in the handset market.<p><i>YouTube uses H.264 to encode video. Presumably, YouTube will be re-encoding its entire library using WebM. When this happens, will YouTube’s support for H.264 be dropped, to “enable open innovation”?</i><p>YouTube continues to support other proprietary formats. As with Sorenson, they're not going to drop H.264 until they don't care about the market share of H.264-only devices. In the meantime, they will try to drive people towards WebM in support of ""open innovation"". This is not inconsistent or even new.<p><i>Do you expect companies like Netflix, Amazon, Vimeo, Major League Baseball, and anyone else who currently streams H.264 to dual-encode all of their video using WebM?</i><p>It should be obvious that Google's hope is anyone using HTML5 video will eventually move to WebM exclusively.<p><i>If not, how will Chrome users watch this content other than by resorting to Flash Player’s support for H.264 playback?</i><p>Content producers won't care if Chrome users end up in Flash, since the content's still available and very few non-mobile users are getting HTML5 video anyway. Flash is still the norm outside of mobile devices.<p><i>Who is happy about this?</i><p>Were people ecstatic that Chrome supported H.264?

Assembly, C, and PHP are all weakly-typed, at the very least, and their proponents agree with this. They don't agree on <i>why</i> they are weakly-typed, simply that they are.<p>The original definition I ever heard for weak-typing, back when C and Assembler were the only things that had it, was ""a weakly-typed language allows you to take the <i>raw, in-memory representation</i> of data of type A, and perform operations on it as if it were data of type B that had an equal <i>raw, in-memory representation</i>."" The most famous example of this is Quake's fast invsqrt(), where the bytes making up a float have int operations applied to them, as if they were bytes making up an int.<p>Of course, PHP doesn't have this capability, but we still call it weakly-typed. So the definition must have moved on from its previous strict form. What does PHP allow you to do, that gets it called weakly-typed? This:<p><pre><code>    echo ""("" + 5 + "")""; # prints ""5""!
</code></pre>
PHP, here, is taking the Strings ""("" and "")"" and interpreting them as numbers for the purposes of the addition operator. However, the strings ""("" and "")"" are not <i>valid</i> numbers—but PHP is fine with this, and uses the default numeric value of 0 to represent this invalidity.<p>The similarity with the original definition, is that the data is transformed from one type to another, not <i>implicitly</i>, and not that the <i>raw</i> representation of the data is used, but rather <i>without a guarantee that the datatypes have the same capacity for informational entropy</i>. In other words, casting ""("" to a number <i>silently loses data</i>, just as storing an <i>int</i> in a <i>char</i> variable in C silently loses data. This fact seems to be universal to all languages that get called ""weakly-typed"", and non-existent in any language that has never had that epithet applied to it.<p>It has nothing to do, notice, with whether a language will implicitly cast values—as long as all implicit conversions happen <i>upward</i> to types that have ""room"" for all the information in the original representation (char -> int, int -> String, int -> float) the language is still strongly-typed. And notice that the datatype <i>itself</i> being lost in a typecast (String -> Object) cannot be a reason to call a language weakly-typed because, in an interface-like cast like this, all the <i>data</i> is still retained, and its original form can be reclaimed simply by casting it back (Object -> String).",1294799800

I just implicitly converted a String to an Object, which the GP's definition disallows.<p>Of course you can fix up the definition for Java by adding the proviso ""except upcasting a derived type to a superclass of that type"", but the fact that you have to add a language-specific proviso indicates why there's no accepted <i>common</i> definition.<p>But at least with that proviso our definition works for all <i>object-oriented</i> languages, right?

This is one of these technologies that will really increase the use of h264.<p>I run the larges cycling site and we handle 100s of niche video uploads per day so I follow this closely, and as much as I'd like to jump on webm, I'm going to definitely hold of.
Currently we convert videos to 3 formats to try handle all cases, and having to now multiply that by 2 with another codec is a lot of extra resources.<p>2.5 mbit h264 web HD/appletv h264
1 mbit h264 for web SD/iphone
300 kbit mobile<p>- webm makes no sense in the short term.
- you need apple support to make webm happen faster<p>Think about all the extra resources, time, effort that you are asking from companies in the world to support the 2 formats.  If you want to be efficient with society, keep the support of h264 while webm development happens, transition once all the big players support the new format.  Alternatively take all the money/time/efforts and get apple to transition. If apple does not jump on the wagon, it's going to be years and years of wasted resources in society.",1294799732

The listing of lists doesn't scale horizontally so the browser needs at least 800px width. This will break a lot of browsers (think mobile). It's obvious the designer like the look of the three-across the page, since it does scale in higher resolutions while maintaining three-across (i.e. three-across is forced). The problem is when you force this, your design breaks on some browsers/devices.<p>- Add List Item
The initial 'add-list-item' is just an unlabeled textbox, so the first thing I entered was an URL. Needless to say I did it wrong. The first textbox is the 'title' of the item. When trying to correct my mistake via 'edit' I was faced with three unlabeled textboxes. The first (single line) textbox had the URL I had entered. The second (single line) textbox was empty. The third text box was multi-line (I believe this is for comments). The various entry fields <i>SHOULD</i> be labeled. --You're free to expect me to read your mind, but don't be too surprised when I fail. ;-)<p>- The home/landing page is very sparse. It's easy to see you were aiming for a 'clean' home page (good), but the problem is most people will have no clue what the site does (bad).<p>- popup when adding an item to an existing list
When adding an item to an existing list, the tooltip-like popup letting the user know ""thankyou and moderators will look at the submission"" disappears too quickly. You should make the user 'close' or 'confirm' the popup to be sure it has been read.<p>- <a href=""http://limitedlist.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://limitedlist.com/about</a>
The 'about' page does not clearly state what the site is about, how the should be used, or most importantly, why I should want to use it.<p>- security/permissions
If I create a list, am I the 'moderator' of that list? Can I allow/disallow other users to add items?<p>- update notifications
If I create a list (or subscribe to a list), can I get an email/sms/IM/twiter/FB/whatever message sent to me every time a new item is added to it (or other change updates)?<p>- spreadsheet
Other than a pretty interface, what advantage does your app have over a google spreadsheet?<p>(Yes, I often ask the pointed question above and I probably seem like an ass for it, but it really is an important question to ponder very deeply.)<p>- Integration / API
If I created/moderated a list and wanted to integrate it into my own page, there's no way to do it. I might want to integrate the list onto a page on my own website, but more seriously, I can see where integrating a managed list on a FB 'home page' or 'fan page' or similar could really be desirable. I'm not a FB user, but even I can see how such integration might make your site/app really take off, and similar could be said for other social 'user-home' services (gmail, yahoo, myspace, youtube, ...).<p>- Useful?
Though having and Internet based, multi-user list is an interesting concept, I cannot think of what I would use it for? (NOTE: this could be entirely my own fault due to lack of imagination and/or coffee)<p>COMPLIMENTS:<p>- The design is nice and clean.<p>- I like your use of drop-shadow.<p>- I was <i>VERY</i> pleased to see the 'thumbs-up' icon was not a FB 'like' button.<p>NOTES:

Here's a reply I wrote -<p>--<p>Your positions there were good... I need to reflect and pick my words a lot more carefully when I write on something that touches people so closely like parenting. I am actually an admirer of the Chinese way <i>except not the abusive jerk part of it</i>. But I studied Chinese culture some - they're incredible. They move somewhere, dirt poor, and within 2-3 generations they're established, prosperous, educated, own businesses and real estate, have established families... I remember one time I was staying in a small inn in Amsterdam owned by a Chinese family, recent immigrants to the Netherlands. They'd rent all the rooms, and if every room got rented, the couple and their young son would go sleep in the lobby at midnight instead of their own room.<p>In the end, the place would only sell out maybe 10 nights per month, for a total of perhaps 800 euros per month for the inconvenience... but then that's about $12,000 USD per year they're banking by sacrificing their own comfort. Later, they'd for sure invest that into education, expanding in business, things like that. It's why Chinese are so successful anywhere.<p>But I should've stressed that I think the abusive and mean aspects of it are crap. I do think it's crap. But more self-sacrifice, achievement, duty, service... I don't know, I think America is way too far in the other direction. It's funny cuz I'm guessing our ideal parenting styles aren't very far apart. Lots of encouragement but also emphasizing it's not just do whatever makes you happy - delay gratification, serve worth causes, strive for more, better yourself, give your kids a much better life than you had, etc, etc.",1294798229

Even Mark Twain, surely the closest in spirit to such a style, was an order of magnitude more grandiloquent than that in his published writing.

No, this is very much a 20th century aphorism. A quick look at Wikiquote reveals that the earliest validated citation is... Maya Angelou! In an interview from 1989. But they trace it back to Sheridan (1819):<p><pre><code>  You write with ease, to show your breeding,
  But easy writing's curst hard reading.

A time when GIF is used for majority of graphics on the web and PNG is just a blimp. You would have used exactly the same reasoning to say that GIF is just fine, PNG doesn't benefit you right now and PNG supporters just want to force unnecessary work to convert GIFs to PNGs.<p>And then on December 24, 1994 ""Unisys stated that they expected all major commercial on-line information services companies employing the LZW patent to license the technology from Unisys at a reasonable rate, but that they would not require licensing, or fees to be paid, for non-commercial, non-profit GIF-based applications, including those for use on the on-line services"".<p>And then ""In August 1999, Unisys changed the details of their licensing practice, announcing the option for owners of Billboard and Intra net Web sites to obtain licenses on payment of a one-time license fee of $5000 or $7500.[18] Such licenses were not required for website owners or other GIF users who had used licensed software to generate GIFs.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format#Unisys_and_LZW_patent_enforcement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format#Uni...</a><p>Before Unisys decided to start enforcing the patent, everything was fine with using GIF and there was no need to do the work. But after they did decide to start enforcing it, potentially every person using GIF to publish images on the web was liable for GIF licensing fees. Web luckily survived that one without major disruption and after the fact PNG is now the standard used.<p>WebM is a defensive weapon to make sure that the history won't repeat itself, this time with video format.<p>The tactic used by Google is risky but on the other hand if no one takes a stand, we will never get rid of h264 as de-facto dominant standard and we'll get a GIF-like money grab.<p>You have just told us that you're only interested in short-term convenience even if it'll cost you big time in the future. That's understandable and most people will act exactly the same.<p>Which is why the only way to replace proprietary h264 with an open, royalty-free technology is to make it inconvenient for people to use h264 and more convenient to use WebM.

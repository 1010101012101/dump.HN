Smart cities presumably can capture individual innovation, but also collective data for collective decision making, and machine/computer information.<p>The difficulty here lies in the fact that it is supposed to then be owned and operated by private individuals. There is not really a mention of a vote - smart cities are independent of governance structure. The pitfall is that modern senses of the importance of &#x27;efficiency&#x27; may lure some into thinking that having the intelligence/data and a well greased economy are enough to understand the underlying population&#x27;s preferences (on the whole, behavioral economics has proven this false).<p>That&#x27;s not to say getting some real and real-time data about an entire city isn&#x27;t an exciting prospect.",1432558722

Most places aren&#x27;t even happy with 40 hours a week. I work remotely (9 time zones apart!), but I find that I spend at least 2 hours of my day on communication.  Since I&#x27;m fairly productive the rest of the time (6 hours), I can more than make up for it.  If you were only working 3-4 hours a day, I can imagine that in many circumstances it would be a struggle to be productive.<p>Having said that, there <i>are</i> some teams who are super organized and can just ship off short stories if you are an amazing coder.

9599858,story,,,5,13,icki,"Ask HN: Financial independence in high cost of living city?",,"Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m a recent grad with about 2 years of professional experience, currently working as a software developer. Even though I think my salary is higher than average for where I work, I am still struggling to come to terms with the high cost of living in my city.<p>The average cost of a detached home in Toronto has just passed $1M Canadian dollars (~$820k US). Even if I were to commit to a commuter lifestyle and live outside the city, a 20% down payment could require upwards of $100,000. Some say that a recession in the housing market is inevitable, but with so much foreign investment and insatiable demand for detached homes, I just find it hard to believe. Worst of all, with real estate prices having climbed ~10% each year for the past few years (faster than the average salary, and at a higher rate than a typical mortgage), real estate ownership is getting further and further out of reach.<p>When I look southward, I see such vibrant cities in the US where developers are getting paid more, and the cost of living (and real estate ownership) are much lower.<p>I fear that I am coming off sounding as entitled, as many of my non-techie friends are struggling to find jobs relevant to their studies, while I am in a situation where I am quickly paying off my student loans and trying to increase my savings. I&#x27;m still young, and perhaps I am just asking for too much. I would very much like to spend more time working on my own projects, and would like to one day do that full-time. However, I can&#x27;t imagine that happening without a large safety net (not having to worry about a mortgage, or rent).<p>I guess I haven&#x27;t really asked a question yet ...

9599846,comment,9599292,9599292,0,0,ar0,,,"I have asked myself the same question some time ago. I believe it comes down to (as some commenters below have already mentioned) the following, ordered by decreasing importance:<p>1. Legal issues:
Hiring people across borders is a nightmare for both the employer and the employee when it comes to social deductions, taxes, health insurance, applicable labor laws, etc. And if you hire people <i>within</i> borders, many European countries are small enough that they could just as well commute to your office (maybe that&#x27;s also the reason why more remote work is available in Germany and the UK, being larger countries, as has been stated below).<p>2. No Silicon Valley:
Let&#x27;s face it - most American companies will expect you to show up at the office every day just as they do in Europe. The exception are primarily the tech startups, and in the United States there simply are a lot more of them than in Europe.<p>3. Worker protection: 
I think hiring remote workers is inherently more risky than hiring on-site staff. You will have less control over your employees, you might even have less control over the hiring process (no on-site meeting), etc. In the United States, you can just try it - hire someone to work remotely, see if he or she can deliver and if not, just terminate the employment and go back to hiring on-site staff. In many European countries, getting rid of employees once you have hired them can be quite challenging and requires solid proof that they are not delivering what they should - and to make matters worse, getting that proof will also be much more difficult if they are working remote with less oversight.<p>4. Language issues: 
Yes, many people in Europe speak English (more or less fluently). Nevertheless, following conference calls in a language that is not your native language will be more challenging than following a face-to-face meeting, so language barriers become more pronounced when interacting remotely (at least in my experience).",1432558330

To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly.

So, had to spend some time explaining that. Not rocking the boat is quite valuable when you&#x27;re busy and worried - just keep doing what you know.<p>Second, a contractor is not an employee - contractors are services you buy piece by piece, whilst you &quot;own&quot; an employee (not pretty terminology but unfortunately often true) and you can milk that employee with a potentially infinite return on your finite investment. Is this a stupid thing to think, yes, but nevertheless I encountered it.<p>Third, it&#x27;s about control. It&#x27;s possible, but harder to micro-manage remotely (and in practice no sane contractor will accept it without extreme compensation).<p>Fourth, it&#x27;s also a hell of a lot easier for a &quot;consultant&quot; to &quot;end the contract&quot; when he&#x27;s fed up with bad management, than for an employee to move his entire life yet again (metaphorically if not physically). A consultant benefits from having had many &quot;clients&quot;, an employee is hurt by too many moves. These &quot;traps&quot; make an employee more pliable and invested emotionally (at least in managers&#x27; eyes) so the managers prefer employees.<p>Fifth, IP. Employee contracts usually sign over everything. Remote contracts, being for services, have more opaque IP agreements. This also applies to a lesser extent to security - that remote dude is working on a foreign network, foreign machine, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these are desirable things, but these were my conclusions from experience. YMMV, different businesses have different cultures, etc. If you want to change your internal culture, I think these are the issues/fears to address.<p>We ended up getting remote jobs because the test we put up for the job ended up not getting a single application locally, but dozens from all over the world. About half the folks who passed relocated, the rest stayed on remotely.<p>I&#x27;m now running my company completely remotely. We have a mailing address in London and Hong Kong and work from home. I see almost no reason to get an office. Unfortunately we&#x27;re also not hiring because we have a long waitlist of nice candidates that we will hire (remotely) as soon as we clear enough revenue.

Islam was created in a war, continued in a war, and the early muslims did not stop fighting and massacring for hundreds of years. This is very well reflected in the religion.<p>2) most muslims do not believe and do not follow this, BUT DO teach these texts to their children<p>3) when (and if) society abandons them as young adults, and they search comfort in religion, as one does (and I&#x27;m sure you have done on occasion, Lord knows I have), islamic clerics then use these texts to support the case that they need to fight and kill for paradise.<p>4) That this is a growing phenomenon. Well, not really. If you read history you&#x27;ll see that this was an extremely common practice even in the Ottoman empire. There&#x27;s simply been a 100 year near-hiatus in this form of recruiting, and it&#x27;s actually still at a very, very low level compared to what it was in the 19th century.<p>5) I claim the problem is that those recruiting clerics are right. That islamic texts do indeed say to fight and kill, very clearly, very directly. Stopping this phenomenon can happen in one of two ways. First, society could choose to simply never abandon anyone, ever. Second we could prevent step 2) from happening. Fighting things at the recruiting stage is an exercise in futility.<p>Am I being an ignorant bigot ? Perhaps.",1432556948

A good rule of thumb that I try to follow is that for the most part, your code should be self explanatory (comments should cover the rest). We have these rules in programming for how to write variable names, and they&#x27;re better than the ones in that slide. Another rule, that trumps any other is consistency. If you&#x27;re working on a project that uses the passive voice (which I think works better for some cases) then use that. The nature of programming is different than natural language writing, and so it makes more sense that these rules that are trying to be transferred over are ill equipped to do so.<p>I mentioned that some of the things just don&#x27;t make sense As an example, this was one of the slides, &quot;when writing a novel a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature.&quot; What does this mean? Its ironic that the slide preaches being short and to the point, and yet is bloated with abstract fluff.",1432556492
9599747,comment,9599292,9599292,0,0,netcan,,,"I think any answer to this question will be speculative and opinionated. People have their experience and they have their preferences. The interpretation of one is based on the other. It&#x27;s like the open plan vs offices debate that springs up on HN every so often. Mostly what we have is personal preferences justified with &quot;facts.&quot; In reality I don&#x27;t think we have that kind of understanding of what makes people work well.  Reality is complicated with short term and long term effects, feedback effects and adaption.<p>Those qualifications aside, I think (A) coding is uniquely well suited to remote work and (B) transitioning to remote work as a major way of working is a long cultural transition that companies will need to grow around. They&#x27;ll only do that if it&#x27;s advantageous enough and the process could take a generation.<p>Coding is well suited to remote work because it can be parceled effectively with clear responsibilities and deliverables. It&#x27;s like journalism in that sense. If you need to produce 2 articles a week and the articles are the output of your work, then it&#x27;s easy for everyone to understand that you did in fact contribute two articles and form an opinion of their quality.<p>The parts that are hard about remote working is structuring a culture that is able to cooperate without physical presence. Physical presence is a key feature of how we interact. Online discussions are different to face-t-face discussions. People travel international at great expense and inconvenience in order to do business face to face. It&#x27;s subtle buts adds up to a lot.<p>Maybe we are getting better at remote communication and collaboration. Maybe the ways we work can adapt to the environment of remote working. But, it&#x27;s a cultural shift.<p>Remote work is strange in the same way that remote parenting, remote dating or remote friendship is. At the end of the day, the relationship that will come out of a remote marriage will not be the same as a regular marriage. That may be OK for remote working. I am sure that some companies are making it their advantage, but it&#x27;s not a simple matter.<p>TLDR: If a company that exists in a building today decided to transition over two years to a company where people work from home, the company would probably fail. The transition is hard.",1432556488

Groovy/Grails and Spring were managed and promoted together, and the more likely reason is the Spring team didn&#x27;t want Groovy/Grails attached and petitioned the VMWare managers to dump them. Perhaps the Groovy and/or Grails people were trying to take over in some way. Grails 3.0 released in March now bundles Gradle as well as Groovy and Spring from before, perhaps another predatory move. It could explain why Gradleware recently employed two of the retrenched Groovy/Grails developers from VMWare, to help in protecting their product against takeover by bundling.",1432556439

The US is a big place and it is United from West to East Coast.<p>In Europe, once you start making lots of money, every country you touch wants your money. So if you hire a French guy the French gobertment will love to tax YOUR ENTIRE business based on their socialistic views of the world, even when you are located in other country. Rinse and repeat with any country you touch.<p>Instead of focusing on the tech side of things you have to make an incredible effort with bureaucracy alone.<p>The advantages of remote working are very clear, but so are the disadvantages: People can goof all day or do the laundry, take care of the kids at the employer expense. The employer could also abuse taking extra hours of the employee for free.<p>For neither the employer or the employee to abuse each other or just being productive when nobody is watching you(directly, of course I know what my people are doing even when I am not in front of them)a series of techniques has been developed . It takes practice, effort and time for people to get used to it.<p>But yes, once you try it you will never want to go back. You can never eliminate the need to meet your coworkers from time to time(once a week or month) though.<p>Most business in Europe are old and big, they do what has been proved to work(in a pre Internet world) for decades. They move slowly, but they move.<p>Big companies operate over the principle of &quot;nobody ever got fired for doing what used to work&quot;. When they see success examples of other big companies doing remote working, they will follow. But today only a few jobs, like programming or personal assistants could be completely done remotely.<p>My advice is to create your own company and to take advantage of this problem, you know in the business world we call them &quot;opportunities&quot;.

Do you have a daughter ? Do you think an agreement with the girl&#x27;s father makes paedophilic rape moral ? Because your religion clearly is of that opinion. Note that your prophet has a lot of opinions on what he, personally, should be given, and something to fuck is often among the things he &quot;gets&quot; from his invisible friend, this is not a lone occurence. So answer this simple question : was Muhammad an immoral paedophilic rapist ? Or not ...<p>And to be honest, since Abu Bakr is a &quot;rightly guided caliph&quot; and made this agreement with the prophet, that means that BOTH the prophet AND the first ever muslim where paedophilic rapists. One organising the rape, one committing it. Muhammad, of course, claims this agreement was blessed by allah : so you can&#x27;t even make the pathetic argument that it was just him, &quot;not allah&quot;. Note that not even Aisha believed the revelations [1]. To be honest, actually reading the hadith you find a lot of that : verses that make it crystal clear none of the muslims with the prophet believed in his revelations. You should try it, reading those texts around book 60.<p>> I fail to see where it says that the death penalty is involved here. Please point out explicitly where it says that the penalty for living in a non-Muslim country is death.<p>The penalty for consistently refusing to comply with sharia, when you know the law and how it applies to you, is death. As you very well know. Believe it or not, you do not just get to violate sharia whenever you want according to islam. The punishment for violating something haram knowingly, repeatedly or continuously ... is death, because this constitutes apostasy. I can&#x27;t say I recall the full set of requirements, but do you seriously argue otherwise ?<p>Knowingly not following sharia is considered apostasy, advocating not following sharia is proselytizing. Do you disagree with that ? Do I really have to dig up fatwas saying so ?<p>> We point out these bad things, and we do not follow their footsteps.<p>Reading this in a post that starts off by justifying the rape of a 6 year old girl, that is very reassuring.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sultan.org/books/bukhari/060.htm#006.060.248"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sultan.org/books/bukhari/060.htm#006.060.248</a>",1432556317

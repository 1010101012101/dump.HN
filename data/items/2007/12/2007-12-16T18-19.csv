Does anyone have the experience just what it takes to be accepted to the universities there?  I am thinking of the more respectable universities of course.<p>Anything would be very much appreciated.",1197831432

90141,comment,90065,90139,0,0,sadiq,,,"True. <p>I've seen some interesting work on the latter case that produces upper and lower bounds for time to an acceptable solution but so far it seems to be limited in it's application to real world tasks.<p>Missing the global max less of an issue, an acceptable level of fitness is generally all that's required for most applications. Though I guess there are several tasks for which a global max would be useful.",1197830927

As a result of this funding, the lab exists and people are trained in the basic science. Turning an already existing lab towards stuff useful for the company is much easier than building one from scratch. <p>Since much of that basic research money is funneled into universities, corporations have to go to universities to get the benefits.",1197829800

You know you've not arrived at an acceptable solution when your fitness is below your required level.<p>Granted, you never know there is a configuration with a fitness greater than your required fitness but this is generally considered when constructing the fitness function.",1197829761

90135,comment,90065,90065,0,0,mynameishere,,,"It's not a good comparison. In the very, very long-term, the ""fit"" inventions do tend to win out, but that says nothing about the processes by which they were built. That is, unless you get really loose with the definition. If I'm designing a bridge, and I come up with 10 blueprints, and select the best one...that's not really an evolutionary process, and neither would it be if 10 different engineers came up with a blueprint. If we build 10 bridges and wait for nine to collapse, well, that would be an evolutionary engineering process.  (Again, over centuries and centuries, that very thing occurs.)<p>A better analogy would be comparing the marketplace with a harsh environment. There, Linux survives for a mundane reason--just like mammals needed less heat from the atmosphere, linux needs less money from its customers. So, it may win out in the end.",1197829408

You may have several iterations going on but at best you can expect to find several local maxima - at any given time. Further, if there is no ""stagnation"", how do you know that you've found a solution?",1197829040

It is for me one of the best contributions I have ever seen to fight this problem. Aside from the discussions of the definition of the disease, one of the biggest struggles of the manic depressives and their close ones is how to overcome the social stigma. I will admire the genius of the Stephen Fry and all of the participants in this documentary, wherever it comes from.",1197828811

Or close them.<p>Having been a professor (now in the private sector), I'm not sure that multinationals will get what they are expecting from academia. Bell Labs and PARC had ""applications"" built into their DNA. Professors, especially tenured ones, always have an out: academic freedom. Concomitantly, I'm not sure that universities will get what they want, ultimately, either. They are selling their academic horsepower, but may lose academic integrity. It's an interesting relationship.<p>Having said that, a really smart multinational might get more bang for their buck by funding an army of startups and small research-oriented firms, both with much lower overhead costs than academia (50%+).",1197828746

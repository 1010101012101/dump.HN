7260652,comment,7258026,7260078,1,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"> You seem to be saying that in order to fire a projectile farther, one needs to make launch angle closer to vertical.<p>I didn&#x27;t say anything even close to that. Not even ballpark.<p>I said that if you fire at a high angle you won&#x27;t have much kinetic energy when the projectile finds its target. This topic is about firing non-self-propelled projectiles (cannon balls, railgun pellets, etc) from a ship or some other platform near sea level, several people are claiming that you can fire at a high enough angle to escape the horizon while still maintaining enough forward momentum to do significant damage, I am saying that at those angles the forward momentum is largely consumed as height.<p>The projectile will travel away and up, and then after it reaches its apex where it has consumed a lot of its forward momentum to elevate itself it will fall back to earth only at the speed gravity carries it at (minus wind resistance).<p>So while, yes, you can likely hit a ship or other target beyond the horizon, you cannot do so with more kinetic force than the projectile&#x27;s weight being carried down by gravity (which is typically not very much relative to the kind of speeds we&#x27;re talking about when initially fired).",1392753553

I see Irrational as a successor to Looking Glass, although I would prefer LG to be still existing.<p>I am split whether Bioshock threw away too much or just enough from System Shock 2. At my first playthrough, I was on the edge about this. The &quot;would you kindly&quot; scene cought me as off-guard as the Shodan reveal in SS2, so I forgive Bioshock a lot in the story department. It was definitely the more polished game in many regards.<p>SS2 is hard to play nowadays and some things (like the ghosts) just really didn&#x27;t work in hindsight. Also, the crafting and inventory-tetris didn&#x27;t really add to the game. There is a lot in it that could be removed for good. On the other hand, SS2 stood at a time where those things hadn&#x27;t been properly tried yet and is a good example of a game that has to be commended for trying out new things. And damn, was it great to actually explore the story.<p>I heard a (german) podcast about old games a while ago where one of the podcasters said that he thinks that gamers in the 90s had more tolerance for games trying something and failing, because it was such a rapidly evolving medium.<p>Perhaps, Bioshock was the System Shock for the 2000s and us old-school gamers wanted it to be something that relentlessly tries out things just as in the old times.<p>Still, Bioshock is light-years ahead in story-telling and world-building than most games of that era. &quot;Would you kindly&quot; is a great example: It shows that the game was built around a narrative and not around a series of set pieces.",1392753344

7260620,comment,7259654,7260513,13,0,VonGuard,,,"Very correct on the indie thing. It&#x27;s the only way to ensure some stability: keeping it small, keeping it simple.<p>The big game development studios have always been like this. Half the time, they do have concurrent dev cycles, multiple games in the works, concepts being fleshed out for the next game long before the current game ships.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem: the publishers. They give your studio money at the beginning of a development process, and that entitles them to be utter ogres about schedules and ship dates. It&#x27;s very common for a &quot;next project&quot; to be yanked out of your studio&#x27;s hands and placed with another firm. It&#x27;s also common for development studios to pull in outside firms to help them on projects, as when Gearbox pushed the Aliens Colonial Marines game to Timegate Studios.<p>The end result is that there is this humongous push to get whatever is next to ship out the door, and to hire and freelance help around that project. Once that project is done, shifting to something new would require repurposing everyone, which means a few months of unproductive work, or worse yet: a few months of no work... Check out some of the details in <a href=""http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/02/12/fall-of-the-empire-how-inner-turmoil-brought-down-a-legendary-studio.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/02/12/fa...</a><p>Going from the period of game development where you&#x27;re experimenting, to the time where you&#x27;re full-bore pushing on a final vision is not something you do overnight. it requires a lot of prep work from game designers, engine developers, and art directors. If they&#x27;ve just been doodling around and trying to &quot;find the fun&quot; as is the primary goal in most early game dev processes, then they&#x27;re probably not ready to gear up for a huge push on something as soon as the previous game ships.<p>Thus, you get this scenario where AAA require millions of dollars to make, but developers don&#x27;t have that kind of cash (save a very few), so they get it from a publisher, who then handcuffs them to ship dates. Anything you can do to get that ship date met will result in a return of vastly more money to your studio, due to how contracts tend to work, so you throw money at the problem through staffing up.<p>Then, when the game&#x27;s done, you go around to publishers with the next idea and take on another million dollar contract. Why? Because the funds you receive from publishing that last game don&#x27;t come into your account (if you actually get any money at all: many agreements are only for the up-front $) immediately. These are effectively royalties, so you will basically be waiting a full quarter to get your next check from the publisher. At this point, you can&#x27;t afford to float 200 AAA developers and artists for a full quarter.<p>This is why online, in-game-transaction games are utterly decimating the publishers in terms of growth. Riot Games is immense. Valve makes oodles. Why? There are no publishers between them and the player. All the money comes back to them I don&#x27;t think Riot&#x27;s had a layoff yet. Valve&#x27;s layoffs were entirely project-based, not funds-based.<p>Publishing yourself online is the future, in every way. It encourages agile development, and lets people go home at night to sleep (except the server admins, but they can&#x27;t sleep in any industry).",1392753233

If we assume no resistance vertical or horizontal at a 50ft drop the projectile is travelling downward at 55 fps by the time it hits the ground.  As you can see, the horizontal velocity is still orders of magnitude greater than the vertical velocity.  As you start to deal with curvature of the earth your drop distance will increase, but not enough to overcome the 9k fps in horizontal velocity any time soon.  The horizon is 3 miles off, or 16k ft.  Less than 2 seconds of travel time for our projectile.

In the 1850s 90% of the people in the US were farmers.  Around 1900 that number shrank to 30% and today it now stands at about 3% so farmers can now grow 30x as much food as they used to be able to.  But even given a 3000% increase in productivity there are still people starving in the world.<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/trouble/timeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/trouble/timeline/</a><p>Why is that?  Well part of it is that making a single farmer 30x as productive involves a LOT more capital.  You need tractors, plows, planters, sprayers, combines, and somewhere to store it all.  You also need a lot of fuel to make everything go and maintenance to keep it all working.  Worse, most of these items can&#x27;t be co-oped between farmers because they&#x27;ll all need them at the same time.  It&#x27;s not uncommon for a farmers to have several hundred thousand to several million dollars worth of equipment.<p>In response to the complexities you&#x27;ve mentioned I think that&#x27;s the whole of the problem; implementation.

In most ways, the computer programming industry is a shrinking industry in the USA. There are less computer programming jobs in the USA than there were 20 years ago.<p>Stats from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (USA):<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/c...</a><p>1990 Number of Jobs 565,000<p>2010 Number of Jobs 363,100<p>2012 Number of Jobs 343,700<p>There is a tiny subset of the industry that is growing, and we associate these with the startups in San Francisco and New York. But so far these startups have not created enough jobs to offset the jobs lost due to other factors.<p>This suggests that there must be a vast reservoir or programmers who would like programming jobs, but they can&#x27;t work as programmers because the jobs have disappeared.<p>If the numbers were smaller, you could argue that the loss of jobs was due to inaccuracies in the way Bureau of Labor gathers statistics. But the drop from 565,000 jobs to 343,700 is too large to be a spurious blip.<p>This is a shrinking industry. Computer programming jobs are tied to manufacturing so as manufacturing leaves the USA, so to do the computer programming jobs. Don&#x27;t get caught up in the hype about startups: look at the actual numbers. The government tracks these jobs. The numbers are shrinking.<p>Especially worth a look:<p><a href=""http://americawhatwentwrong.org/story/programming-jobs-fall/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://americawhatwentwrong.org/story/programming-jobs-fall/</a><p>&quot;In its 1990 Occupational Outlook Handbook, the U.S. Department of Labor was especially bullish: “The need for programmers will increase as businesses, government, schools and scientific organizations seek new applications for computers and improvements to the software already in use [and] further automation . . . will drive the growth of programmer employment.” The report predicted that the greatest demand would be for programmers with four years of college who would earn above-average salaries.<p>When Labor made these projections in 1990, there were 565,000 computer programmers. With computer usage expanding, the department predicted that “employment of programmers is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2005 . . .”<p>It didn’t. Employment fluctuated in the years following the report, then settled into a slow downward pattern after 2000. By 2002, the number of programmers had slipped to 499,000. That was down 12 percent–not up–from 1990. Nonetheless, the Labor Department was still optimistic that the field would create jobs–not at the robust rate the agency had predicted, but at least at the same rate as the economy as a whole.<p>Wrong again. By 2006, with the actual number of programming jobs continuing to decline, even that illusion couldn’t be maintained. With the number of jobs falling to 435,000, or 130,000 fewer than in 1990, Labor finally acknowledged that jobs in computer programming were “expected to decline slowly.” &quot;",1392752321

The result was a sort of schizophrenia: Irrational would build these incredible environments and characters, and then stick them in the exact type of game where players couldn&#x27;t linger over and savor them. They were just a blur that would flash past your gunsights as you killed people.<p>This problem was so evident in the Bioshock games that they led people smarter than I am to eventually coin a term for it: &quot;ludonarrative dissonance&quot; (see <a href=""http://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2007/10/ludonarrative-d.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2007/10/ludona...</a>). Which basically means a game whose story is trying to do one thing while its mechanics are trying to do something completely different, pulling the player in incompatible directions. That -- and Irrational&#x27;s seeming lack of interest in reconciling the two elements in their work -- always seemed like a bigger factor holding them back from greatness than their relative lack of moddability, at least to me.",1392751872

7260412,comment,7253288,7254221,1,0,munificent,,,"This is a great question. There are two main reasons:<p>1. The asset build system is built on top of a bunch of policies and conventions specific to our language&#x27;s package manager. The build system needs to be able to locate plug-ins somehow, and it&#x27;s hard to define that &quot;somehow&quot; without some kind of assumptions for how dependencies are located and organized.<p>2. Like other platforms, we want to minimize external dependencies. If we reuse grunt, then every user has to have node and npm installed. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, of course, and many users do already, but we&#x27;d like to avoid <i>forcing</i> that dependency.<p>3. Since the build system is plug-in based, we need a way for the build tool and plug-ins to communicate with each other. We want that API to be simple so that it&#x27;s easy to create plug-ins. Since they&#x27;re sending entire assets through that communication channel, we need it to be efficient too. It&#x27;s hard to do that in a language-agnostic way.<p>4. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute to the build system and various build plug-ins. Since we already assume users know Dart, then when those components are also written in Dart, it increases the chances that they are able to pitch in and help.<p>I don&#x27;t like walled gardens or feeling like we&#x27;re reinventing the wheel (though I&#x27;ll note that before this announcement, I wasn&#x27;t aware of many other build systems that were as many-to-many based as ours), but there is value in having things be internally consistent.",1392751413

I&#x27;d say the only one that&#x27;s mostly false is #2, but that could be the norm outside of my particular field (computer science).<p>I&#x27;ve seen fantastic research sunk and forced through resubmission time and again because of reviewers that either don&#x27;t understand the work (and why would they? they have zero incentive) or have pre-existing biases based on their own work (and are called in as expert reviewers, effectively functioning as gatekeepers in a subfield).<p>Bad deans/department chairs can make life suck pretty hard. This is usually not the case because they (in my experience) don&#x27;t have that much power, but over some things like hiring they can definitely be as capricious as they want. The real killer are the people outside the department, on IRBs, grant review boards, etc.. In a good research-focused school they can be great; in worse schools they can be tinpot despots.<p>Reproducibility in particular is insane. In computer science virtually no systems are released at the time of a paper submission, so papers describe things that may or may not exist. I&#x27;d say this is less due to untrained/inexperienced grad students and more due to a combination of constantly rushing to publish, unclear institutional regulations regarding releasing artifacts such as source, and inability to focus on cleaning things up for a release.<p>Academia has serious problems at its core, and in a lot of places, it&#x27;s obvious that startups and industry is outpacing it.

7260233,comment,7256960,7258064,5,0,quanticle,,,"I&#x27;m not sure that anything in Ayn Rand&#x27;s novels actually corresponds to the realities of corporate capitalism. I&#x27;ll take one illustrative example: the discovery of Rearden Metal. In <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, Rearden Metal is depicted as the product of the lone genius of Hank Rearden, who defied his own corporate scientists and a made a metal that everyone else considered impossible. At the time, Hank Rearden was not a lone inventor working in his garage. He was already a plutocrat, with multiple millions to his name, and a large corporation backing him.<p>Can you actually think of a case in the real world where that&#x27;s happened? Where the CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation has personally made a breakthrough discovery in his or her field? Of course not. Billion+ dollar companies are crazy complex machines, and our hypothetical CEO has far too much to be doing to be merely mucking around in the lab like a lowly research scientist. He (and I use the masculine deliberately) has a corporation to run. He has decisions to make!<p>No, the closest thing I can think of to Hank Rearden is Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne. Genius CEOs of multi-billion dollar corporations who, by virtue of their sheer brilliance come up with discoveries that all their trained underlings miss, despite having far less time to devote to the topic at hand. And, for that reason, I find Ayn Rand&#x27;s scenarios to be deeply irrelevant. Her characters, plot, and morality are more suited to comic books than novels. There is no ambivalence, no ambiguity in any of her characters or her situations, and her books turn into thousand page morality plays that one reads without gaining any insight into how one should actually behave in the real world.<p>To say that a living person corresponds to a character in an Ayn Rand novel is akin to saying that a living oak tree corresponds to a page in a notebook. You can argue that there are commonalities. But the commonalities between living wood and dead paper do more to obscure than clarify. It is the same with comparisons to Ayn Rand characters. At this point, I&#x27;m ready to just throw out Ayn Rand analogies altogether in my rhetoric, for they seem to add more heat to the discussion than light.",1392750178

28806,comment,28703,28794,0,0,lupin_sansei,,,"It's a myth that capitalism concentrates wealth into the hands of the few. In reality the opposite is the case: Capitalism is better at spreading the wealth among everyone than any other economic system. Look at the Gini coefficient, the freer the economy (the more capitalist) the less economic inequality there is: \n<a href=""http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2006/efw2006es.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2006/efw2006es.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2gd7ue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2gd7ue</a><p><a href=""http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/thumb/6/64/375px-Index2006_EFCapita.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/thumb/6/64/375px-Index2006_EFCapita.gif</a><p>Also the gap between rich and poor has been essentially static for the past 50 years, and shrinking since the 80s \n<a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2005/12/images/walton3.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2005/12/images/walton3.gif</a><p><a href=""http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=pb&id=859"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=pb&id=859</a><p>Yet more proof is in the Economic Freedom index. All rich countries have free economies, and all poor countries have un-free economies: <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/index/countries.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/index/countries.cfm</a> for me that's the smoking gun that capitalism works.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20060111094731/truckandbarter.com/tb_images/ef_in.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20060111094731/truckandbarter.com/tb_images/ef_in.gif</a><p>""Unfortunately, no one's figured out a better way of distributing wealth.""<p>There are only 2 choices in economics: Capitalism, which is really just people trading freely (and seems to distribute the wealth the best) and communism/socialism, which doesn't allow anybody to trade (and has the worst distribution of wealth). The only other options are systems which are somewhere between, and evidence (from the Economic Freedom index) shows the freer the economy the better off everyone is.<p>Further China isn't particularly capitalist, it's still very heavily socialist: <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/index/country.cfm?id=China"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/index/country.cfm?id=China</a> (although that's changing year by year). So if people are starving in China it's not really capitalism's fault. <p>It's also a myth that capitalism causes starvation. In fact there were no famines in the 20th century in any capitalist countries. All the famines were related to Marxism (China, Russia, Ethopia, North Korea etc.)<p>(This has an indepth look at famines through the ages: <a href=""http://www.mises.org/books/conquest.pdf)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mises.org/books/conquest.pdf)</a>",1182145014

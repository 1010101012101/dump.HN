Now you're right, I could set all those in code, alloc all those labels and adjust their sizes and positions relative to the ones that came before and all of that jazz, and that's all fine and dandy. Until I realize that my design needs tweaking. So, instead of selecting all elements on the nib and pressing up twice for a two pixel shift, I'm sitting there editing 20 different things in a CGRect call... way more work.<p>So instead of doing it all in code, the way I went about was creating a subclass of UIView with a .xib file attached to it. The .xib has everything where I want it visually and it's connected to the header via properties of everything that needs to be dynamic. Then I made a custom init method that just takes in my object and returns a UIView object that is the totality of that nib loaded with the data I need it to be.\nAll in all, instead of bloat, every time I need to return an instance of that custom subclass I effectively call something like this:<p><pre><code>  UIView *newView = [CustomClass createCustomViewWithObject:(id)object];\n</code></pre>\nAnd that's it - I'm free to put it wherever I want up the chain in my subsequent views.",1366171190

Or like that old proof that God exists because he has every desirable quality, including existence -- as if a hypothetical entity could be forced into being by sheer burden of how it is described.<p>When we talk and reason, we call something a universe to invoke all the general properties our universe has -- except existence, of course, because it would be silly if we could only talk about things that exist.  Various things like books and simulations are physical representations of universes that don't exist.  By virtue of our interpretation, they are universes nonetheless.  When reading a book, we fill in assumptions and details from real life if the author gives us no reason to think otherwise.  Tautologically, the world of the book is different from the real world in some limited and structured way, but not in any way that keeps it from being a world at all.<p>Physics seeks to explain the world exhaustively and reductionistically in terms of mechanisms, models, and mathematics -- basically, to boil it all down to the consequences that emerge from laws and equations that we can completely conceptualize.  If the universe consisted just of electromagnetism, for example, then Maxwell's equations would be a ""complete"" description of the universe, and any simulation of them could be considered a universe.  Everything about the universe, every general description that's true of it without reference to specific places, times, and things, would be reflected in the simulated universe as well, because science allows us to subsume it all into the more fundamental description given by the equations.<p>The problem is that a model of the universe is stil a <i>model</i>.

If Apple started making their own chips, you wouldn't attribute Apple's financial success to that alone.<p>Based on the fact that Qualcomm's profit is ~31.7% of it's revenue (in FY12Q4) you could estimate that the profit from chip sales was closer to $1b/quarter (based on annual chip sales revenue of $12.976 billion in 2012) and then the question is how much of this is from ARM sales, which I don't have an answer to.<p>As to their valuation passing Intel - again, this is based on more than chip sales, and Intel's market share is still almost four times that of Qualcomm currently (though this is likely to keep dropping, for sure).<p>Personally I'm still far more keen on ARM than the manufacturers. Having factories that create chips from ARM's licenses is very different to turning commodity products into goods like perfume - in the latter it is in part about creativity and marketing (and probably patents, etc. etc.) in the former it is much more about economy of scale, efficiency, etc.<p>What would it take to beat Qualcomm when it comes to producing ARM chips, and can it be done - get the price lower, and yes it probably could be by someone like Texas Instruments, Samsung, event Intel if they wanted to, potentially AMD (who do want to but I think probably are too small to). How about beating ARM themselves - all of a sudden you're not just trying to out-price the same products, you have to come up with better architecture and get the world to switch over. Whole different ball game.<p>All that said, Qualcomm are definitely in a great position, and are doing really well. But from a spectator point of view I think ARM are much more exciting, from an investor point of view I think that ARM's long-term future has more potential, and short-term they are paying out dividends per share greater than Qualcomm's total earning per share.<p>edit: Oh, and remember that even after the decline in profit, Intel's quarterly net profit is still higher than Qualcomm's.

That means it's extraordinarily rare even on our planet. By most measures, humans barely managed to survive, and we got lucky to so far avoid a wipeout event.<p>The odds of life being generated in any given billion year time frame, on a planet that can possibly support it, and assuming the right conditions for intelligent life (eg that the planet doesn't get destroyed or altered by an asteroid etc), and on the reduction goes.<p>I think spacefaring life is exceptionally rare, and it only gets X amount of time to potentially exist before the solar system or galaxy or universe crushes it.<p>In short, I don't think there's enough time for intelligent life to span even a galaxy before being wiped out by nature.

Morphisms are really not defined much beyond that; it is all left rather abstract, though there are some basic laws that must be satisfied.<p>Categories are relatively uninteresting without functors. Functors are more or less mappings or transformations between categories.<p>Category theory by some accounts initiated in the foundations of algebraic topology. In that subject, one wishes to codify some of the aspects of a high-dimensional shape or geometric object in algebraic terms. The hope is that the algebraic image of the shape is easier to understand than the shape itself. The mapping of shapes into their algebraic ""shadows"" is a functor.<p>For instance, you can take a torus and look at the collection of all closed loops drawn on the surface of the torus. Now identify two loops as the same if one can be smoothly deformed into the other by moving it along the surface of the torus. Long story short, this gives the set of such loops a structure known as a group. There is a very extensive theory developed around groups, so you might surmise that you could partially classify shapes by looking at this associated group (called the fundamental group or first homotopy group).<p>This mapping from geometric objects to groups of loops drawn on them is a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of groups. This is the beginning of homotopy theory.<p>As for your comment on sets, there is the category Set which consists of all sets. That is, the objects of Set are sets and, given two sets X and Y, the morphisms between X and Y in Set are simply the functions f : X -> Y. An interesting technical point here (which is related to your quote) is that Set itself cannot be a set, as there is no set of all sets within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (the most common axiomatic formulation of set theory).

If we were in a deep situation like we're in now or Bush was proposing spending that money differently, I think there would have been fewer Democratic comments about the debt.<p>>Maybe 90% Debt:GDP won't hurt too badly, but sooner or later as it rises, it will crater even our economy.<p>Nobody's suggesting that an infinitely high Debt:GDP is a good thing, but a lot of people were using R-R to argue that we had to prioritize debt reduction now as an emergency even at the expense of stimulating the economy or else we'd wind up as some sort of hybrid Greece/Zimbabwe mess within 5 years.<p>>It's about our Government's complete inability to get it under control.<p>I don't really know that that's clear.  We've had a period of time where the budget deficits were run up to pay for a major (Cold) war and the tax reforms, and then we ran very low deficits and surpluses in the 1990s.  We were basically set such that we'd run a surplus during strong economic years (as the Tech Bubble was) and a slight deficit in weaker ones.  We made a series of policy decisions that harmed the budget balance (Iraq, tax cuts, bad policy in Medicare D) but even then, our deficits were still in the neighborhood of nominal GDP growth.  So we're actually doing kinda OK, though obviously not great.  Then we have the mini-depression, which (a) reduced GDP well below potential, (b) reduced tax revenues due to people making less money, and (c) caused automatic stabilizer payouts (food stamps, unemployment, disability) to rise.  It's not like we've been pushing through un-offset new annual spending this last half-decade, beyond the original TARP and ARRA.  So if the economy recovers, we'll probably start to level off back into 2005-era deficits, where the deficit/GDP < nominal GDP growth, causing the debt/GDP to shrink.",1366167760

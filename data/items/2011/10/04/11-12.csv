If you just want an app online, and don't care about how it gets there, and have more money than system administration skill, PaaS is great. My question is more along the lines of ""What do I get with Azure+ that I don't get with PHPFog or an existing AWS AMI or a Linode StackScript?"" What's the killer feature? It's going to be more expensive (you get to buy a cloud-sized slice of a Windwos license), likely slower than a Linux platform (the benchmarks I've seen put PHP on Windows significantly behind Linux deploys), and so far, it doesn't solve the hard parts of a PHP application deployment.<p>I'm a Rails developer, mostly, and I have Heroku apps, apps running on Linode VMs, apps running on rented Rackspace servers, and apps running on AWS. I've got a lot of experience setting this stuff up and maintaining it, but I still really appreciate the simplicity of Heroku; a dashboard of services and extensions ready to install in a click is <i>awesome</i>. Heroku's killer feature isn't that you don't have to set up RVM and Passenger, it's that you don't have to write bundles of daemon managers, monitoring scripts, rake tasks to manage code deploys and reloads, git hooks, background worker management, and a bunch of otherwise-tedious stuff.<p>The sales pitch for Azure+ seems to be ""We solved a problem that only exists on Azure"", which just isn't very compelling. So far, it seems like the only target audience for this thing is people who will only deploy PHP apps on Azure and don't have any other options, period, which seems like a <i>really</i> small target audience.",1317728702

They perform a service, you pay for the service, and everyone's happy.\nFor example, there is no reason why the entire process shouldn't be monetized.

The over-produced album has already been done with -- people buy single items now. Over-production of those single items will probably change as well, as people want faster and faster ""updates"". Changes in broadcasting are fragmenting tastes, making it very difficult to appeal to everyone, so the ""waterfall model"" of music production is producing increasingly diminishing returns. The industry will have to move to different models, like quick iterations (you write a song while you tour, and modify it depending on public reaction).<p>What's so ""wrong"", so unbearable about all that ?

I'm blaming Typekit for serving fonts that look terrible on many systems that aren't running the latest and greatest browsers and operating systems (i.e., most of the machines used to browse the web). Many of them don't look that great even on those newer systems either, certainly not rendering with the quality that you would expect from a pro font displayed in a native application running locally on the machine.<p>For a while shortly after these font-hosting services started going live, every trendy design blog out there started to look worse than it did before, and I couldn't figure out why. For a short time, I actually assumed I'd inadvertently messed up my ClearType settings, or downloaded a dubious update from Microsoft, or found another rendering bug in Firefox, or something along those lines. Then I started to notice these little ""T"" badges in the corner of the pages that didn't render properly, and discovered the hard way that hardly any web fonts were properly hinted for on-screen use, which is why they all looked horrible compared to things like Verdana and Arial/Helvetica.<p>To be fair, a <i>few</i> of them are better now. Still, Typekit's own site looks pretty bad on this computer (I've just checked) and the irony is that it's their custom fonts that render like something from the Windows 95 days, while the body text in Georgia looks as clean as usual. It's not exactly a great sales pitch when the part of your site using your technology looks obviously visibly worse than the part of your site using the tried and tested workhorse you're asking us to give up.<p>[Edit: Here's an example:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/cEGNL.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/cEGNL.png</a><p>Notice that even at display size, the rendering of the heading text in Proxima Nova looks awful. Meanwhile, trusty Georgia even renders with decent italics at body text size.<p>And it looks that way on several systems here, from Firefox on Windows XP to Chrome on Windows 7, so it's nothing to do with ClearType rendering differences, the Firefox rendering problems with HarfBuzz, or any other such excuse.]<p>As I've said many times, the reality is that at today's typical screen resolutions, at body text sizes, there are only so many ways you can turn on the pixels that are going to work. We have had a few brilliantly designed fonts created specifically for that usage available to us for a long time. Anything that is supposed to replace them needs to look different enough to be worth the hassle and render at least as clearly, and most/all of the hosted web fonts currently fail to meet one  or both of those criteria.

That's pretty easy code to write (and make <i>really fast</i> at the same time).<p>I'm guessing there is a right answer, it just might be poorly specified. And automated or unit testing doesn't guarantee that even simple things are correct. It's just a trade-off of how much time you put into the automation versus the time you spend chasing bugs you could have caught with automation (which isn't all of them). I'd think in most real world code (for all the usual real world reasons) that people err on the too-little automated-testing side of things.<p>What do see as the problems with checking the md5sums? I'm guessing they're brittle if the answer isn't supposed to be exactly the same, but that reduces down to the same as checking a number is 5 when it might be between 4.8 and 5.2. It's not rocket science and getting it wrong doesn't invalidate all automated testing. At the very least the first time it throws an error the developer who wrote the bad test is going to learn something new about his system and you might sensibly use such cheaply written tests to locate errors when running code on a different OS (or version) or after minor cosmetic changes where you would expect the exact same result.",1317727035

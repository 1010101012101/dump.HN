I&#x27;d say all in all its very good.<p>Regardless if you believe or care about the NSA issues, simply the idea of routing clear text email through mail exchanges, and advertisers should give you enough reason to follow the few steps it requires to generate a key, and start encrypting and/or signing email. Except for post cards we don&#x27;t do this with our regular mail, so why are you ok with it with you email (and your email is far more machine readable).<p>GPGMail is not quite Grandmother ready, and unlike s/mime it doesn&#x27;t really have an incremental value[1], but it is far more secure, and very easy to use once setup. Plus the other tools in the toolkit are useful for general encryption.<p>s/mime is another option, here are some pros and cons:<p>s/mime pros<p><pre><code>  integrated with many mail apps
  usually plays nice with mailing lists (adding a footer doesn&#x27;t invalidate a sig)
  works on iOS devices (perhaps others?)
  has an incremental value even before all your contacts are using it[1]
</code></pre>
s/mime cons<p><pre><code>  based on a certificate authority model
  cost money depending on the cert you get
  requires a 3rd &#x27;trusted&#x27; party
  does not seem to be secure in some respects:
    (web cert generation, no rules regarding sigh/encrypt/sign[2],
    does not make use of a certificate request so anyone who has
    even momentary access to your email can generate a cert to
    masquerade as you)
  your identity is associate with your email address not you
    (you will need certs for each email address)
</code></pre>
--<p>GPGmail/tools pros<p><pre><code>  Based on web of trust instead of CA (web of trust is not required)
  You can revoke your key if it is compromised
  Based on you not your email, so you can use the same sig with any email address
  You can even associate your picture with your key
  Optional Anonymity
  Strong cryptography
  Use the same keys for non email encryption
  Free
</code></pre>
GPGmail/tools cons<p><pre><code>  Less widely integrated.
  Does not work on devices yet.
  May break email lists (adding footers may change the sig, I haven&#x27;t tested though)
  Can&#x27;t help much until your have other people to use it with.
</code></pre>
[1] With s/mime you can sign email documents even if your friends don&#x27;t have s/mime that can still see your signature is validate.<p>[2] See the answer by Adam Liss (not the accepted answer) for the security issues <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13512026/how-to-check-if-encrypted-s-mime-message-is-also-signed-without-decrypting-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13512026/how-to-check-if-...</a><p>[Edit: formatting]",1374947416

Using the Intel Framework, the scripting is similar to jquery, it fully supports javascript, and you can easily make ajax calls from the compiled app to a php / python / ruby back-end hosted somewhere else.<p>For a normal app, the systems side is pretty trivial. A modestly well configured $150 dedicated box will support 99% of all apps these days; and the bottom 50% of apps, based on usage, can be supported on a $20 Digital Ocean style account. If you&#x27;re going to have a large active user base, then a very well run back-end is obviously that much more important.

And a champion of getting there by removing unneeded features from languages.<p>This was a necessary overcorrection to now-forgotten excesses.  But today it is clear that he went too far.  As an example, I would consider Go&#x27;s a language which is heavily influenced by Dijkstra&#x27;s ideas on the value of simplicity in language design.

Not just your referees, who will likely not compile and test your code, anyhow.<p>The concept may be the most important thing, but what good is a paper asserting some new concept if everyone can&#x27;t verify it? I think it is the approach that folks like Fernando Perez at ipython are pushing with their html notebooks. Reproducible, comprehensible science.",1374944675

You&#x27;re never going to stop crazy people from saying crazy things, and sometimes those people might just happen to be teachers. Besides, if crazy ideas were verboten in education we&#x27;d still be in the dark ages slinging arrows at each other. Tenure was actually explicitly created for respected teachers to be able to say crazy things without getting fired. What are you going to do when a tenured professor starts teaching your child something you disagree with? Are you going to go with the same heavy-handed approach?<p>If you have a problem with the way your child is taught, bring it up with the teacher. Bring it up with the principal. Bring it up with the school board. Ask your child to be moved to a different class/section. Ask your child to be re-zoned. Or, all else failing, teach your own child. Maybe you should be more concerned about hiring standards for our teachers, or maybe consistent accreditation.",1374944445

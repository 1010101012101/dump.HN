4123057,comment,4122764,4122764,4,0,fmstephe,,,"I would strongly back Haskell for this purpose. The reason for this is principally that Haskell is a single install, (whereas Clojure requires the jvm first and then Clojure). Haskell is a single language, Clojure is java with Clojure running on top.<p>When I started learning to program the greatest joy was code=some result. The greatest misery was installation, configuration and bizzaro error messages. In this regard I think Haskell comes out far far ahead. When I first learned Haskell I remember installing Hugs was simple and the REPL worked immediately.<p>I think that the number one consideration for a first time programming language is the ease with which you can get working software that does something and gives feedback. Clojure has too many leaky abstractions and is not nearly as simple to get up and running. (Aside, I like Clojure)<p>I think that what I am reading as an implicit question of ""should a programmer be initially exposed to the greatest type system known to man in Haskell or the one-true programming language in Lisp"" is taking the wrong approach. We should ask ""how can I expose a programmer to the joy of making things using only a brain and a keyboard"". I suspect that many of the best Haskell and Lisp hackers we have got started on Visual Basic because it was so accessible.<p>I would be tempted to say Javascript may be an even better answer. Easy to get started and a browser and a text editor makes for a great IDE.<p>I apologise if my characterisation of your question was wrong. It's not my intention to be offensive or stir up trouble. Those are two great languages to choose from, if you can capture the mind and imagination of a first time programmer with either of them they will be off to a great start.",1339944954

4123024,comment,4121698,4121698,3,0,kabdib,,,"There is a bunch of hardware in the world that is inaccessible. I don't see this changing.<p>Reasons include: Keeping competitors away from what you think are valuable secrets and maintaining an advantage. Keeping people away from features that, if misused, could result in chip damage. Keeping security holes secret (e.g., badly designed DMA hardware that could be exploited, if the flaws were known). Limiting access to known buggy features, or unfinished features that either don't work or that could leak damaging hints about strategic direction. You have purchased or licensed 3rd party technology that you contractually cannot divulge details of. For interoperability with other products you have embedded knowledge of them in the product, under NDA.<p>More: It's expensive to document chips to the point that outside development can be done. Perhaps the documentation doesn't exist, at all, and would have to be reverse-engineered out of the chip design (yes, this happens). It's expensive to write drivers for multiple platforms, or even to get software into a state where it can be consumed by an outside party (just dumping a tree onto GitHub is /not/ a release). You feel that ""forking"" would result in a loss of control of your own product (and would dramatically increase the cost of future releases, lest you break things). You regularly rev chips and cover the changes transparently in the software layer, and this would /not/ be transparent if you released product details (thus increasing the cost of revisions).<p>More (the slimey side): You have misappropriated technology and divulging it would be harmful to you. There are design errors or bugs verging on malfeasance that could expose you to litigation. You have lied about the product's capabilities and a release would reveal this (whereupon, litigation).<p>Or, it's a pain in the ass, the market is significantly less than 1 percent of your total, and you have a horizontal skyscraper of engineers already behind schedule.

Gangguan itu dapat terjadi karena kegemukan atau sebab lain yang belum diketahui<p>Type Diabetes Mellitus<p>Penyakit diabetes mellitus (DM)-yang dikenal masyarakat sebagai penyakit gula atau kencing manis-terjadi pada seseorang yang mengalami peningkatan kadar gula (glukosa) dalam darah akibat kekurangan insulin atau reseptor insulin tidak berfungsi baik.<p>Diabetes yang timbul akibat kekurangan insulin disebut DM tipe 1 atau Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). Sedang diabetes karena insulin tidak berfungsi dengan baik disebut DM tipe 2 atau Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM).<p>Insulin adalah hormon yang diproduksi sel beta di pankreas, sebuah kelenjar yang terletak di belakang lambung, yang berfungsi mengatur metabolisme glukosa menjadi energi serta mengubah kelebihan glukosa menjadi glikogen yang disimpan di dalam hati dan otot.<p>Tidak keluarnya insulin dari kelenjar pankreas penderita DM tipe 1 bisa disebabkan oleh reaksi autoimun berupa serangan antibodi terhadap sel beta pankreas.<p>Pada penderita DM tipe 2, insulin yang ada tidak bekerja dengan baik karena reseptor insulin pada sel berkurang atau berubah struktur sehingga hanya sedikit glukosa yang berhasil masuk sel.<p>Akibatnya, sel mengalami kekurangan glukosa, di sisi lain glukosa menumpuk dalam darah. Kondisi ini dalam jangka panjang akan merusak pembuluh darah dan menimbulkan pelbagai komplikasi.

But even when I do read them all (marginally complex set of options presented, or high risk scenario) I read the right most one first before skipping back to read left to right because I'm trained to skip to the right most button at the bottom of a dialog.<p>This invalidates much of the analysis on visual fixations and comes to the conclusion that placing the primary action on the left actually makes it easier under certain conditions (it's easier to track back to the left most button than to the right most).<p>It just goes to show that training can affect behaviour. If you did extensive eye-tracking tests explaining you're looking for high accuracy, with people who are unfamiliar with technology or who are used to the primary action being on the left, placing the primary action on the right will lead to less effort.

4122996,comment,4122783,4122783,36,0,EricBurnett,,,"Setting aside the motivations for this draft, the idea of removing the one single DNS 'root' is a reasonable one. It acts as a single point of failure for the DNS system and puts the entire DNS hierarchy under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Commerce. There are already existing alternative roots[1], but no interoperability between them and no standards governing them. Indeed, the IETF is strongly against them at present [2].<p>With that in mind, let us examine the flaws in the proposal at hand.<p>* 1. Lettered roots<p>This proposal puts the existing DNS root under a lettered virtual root above it, with implicit resolution to the local AIP. The existing DNS root locations are ALREADY indexed by letter, so this is a recipe for confusion. Even more importantly, this system _will not scale_: There are 26 possible letters, if drawing from the ASCII set only, which permanently restricts the number of autonomous zones. What happens then?<p>This could be resolved by using a unique suffix scheme that does not conflict with the existing or requested TLDs, but would make it that much harder to type an external DNS address. yahoo.com.extdomA for general use would be quite unfortunate.<p>* 2. Who hands out the AIP designations?<p>If every AIP must have a single unique designation, there must be an organization handing them out. The ICANN would be the obvious choice, but that brings us back around full circle.<p>* 3. Ownership conflicts<p>As rfc2826 points out [2], the internet is built on the assumption that domain names are unique. With multiple implicit zones, either the same entity must be able to control their domain within each or we will end up with conflicts. If yahoo.com resolves to the 'Yahoo' corporate entity in most AIDs, but is controlled by Baidu in one, can they claim it? If not, what about the user confusion that would entail?<p>Regardless of the answer to this question, I expect in an AID world everyone would start using external domains for the stronger guarantees they provide. So Yahoo would be permanently yahoo.com.A. Which is complicated by...<p>* 4. Blocking.<p>If AIPs start blocking resolution of specific external domains, what happens? Obviously China would like this, but for the internet at large, having siloed intranets would likely be a huge problem. Every time someone misconfigures BGP and one region of the internet cannot talk to another, things break. A shifting set of resolvable domains would likely cause exactly the same headaches, only they wouldn't go away with the next BGP update.<p>* 5. Proxying and scale.<p>The AIP DNS are required to proxy requests to external domains (3.2 from the draft). Presumably this is to facilitate blocking, but it would also impose significant load issues and key bottlenecks. Note that right now the only equivalent is the root DNS, and it only handles resolution for the TLDs. Something far larger would need to be set up to be able to handle the load of proxying all external requests.<p>Overall, this proposal has far too many foundational issues to be seriously considered. I am personally happy it was drafted - work to break the One True Root should be done in the open with all relevant parties involved. But this draft isn't going to cut it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_DNS_root"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_DNS_root</a>

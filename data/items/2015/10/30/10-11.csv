I took a non-STEM education then transitioned into coding and after many years I now find myself writing proposals, task specifications, and research reports. I increasingly conduct independent reviews of documents other people have written - not just the quality of the English, but primarily whether they expose us as a business to technical or commercial risk because they are confused or misleading.<p>And after many late nights fixing documents just before their due dates, I&#x27;ve developed some basic guidelines that aim to increase clarity, including:\n* Not using multiple distinct terms for the same thing in different parts of the document\n* making responsibilities clear - especially in multi-party contracts! E.g saying &quot;X will do Y&quot; rather than &quot;Y will be done&quot;\n* Not expecting the reader to guess what the writer means (e.g. by saying &quot;there will be an impact&quot;)\n* Not using &#x27;this&#x27; after a discussion that references multiple distinct things.<p>The results might not look like the sort of literature I enjoy reading outside work, but they have much more clarity!",1446202552

One simple use case for dereferencing a raw pointer is if you&#x27;re working with an embedded system. You know (through specs) that address 0x00b1 in memory corresponds to a physical button press on the development board, so you write a loop that continuously dereferences this address and does something based on whether the dereferenced value is 0 (pressed) or 1 (unpressed). As far as the source level is concerned, you&#x27;re just dereferencing a magic address pointing at who knows what value over and over again and never changing that value either. &quot;Unsafe&quot; tells the compiler that you know what you&#x27;re doing. (And sometimes even in C/C++ you&#x27;ll need the &#x27;volatile&#x27; keyword to keep their compilers from optimizing the dereference to only happen once out of the loop.)",1446201994

Not only that, defense attorneys almost always advise their clients to take the plea bargain because they too know the chances at trial are effectively nil (and because public defenders have far smaller budgets than prosecutors). So to reject a plea bargain the defendant will also almost always be going against the advice of counsel.<p>And even if there was no possibly of conviction at trial, then how is it just to try to jail the accused anyway with a bluff and threat? Presumably the DA alone has decided the defendant is guilty but believes the trial system is broken so has taken it on himself to try to incarcerate the accused.<p>Yet all other western nations have far greater restrictions on plea bargains, the UK disallows plea bargains all together. Yet their societies have not collapsed nor become overrun with violent crime.<p>2. The DNA testing of death row inmates is indeed biased but not in direction you imagine. Many states simply do not allow DNA tests of convicted persons solely because it would reopen too many cases. Likewise is is also necessarily limited to those for which DNA evidence exists.<p>But even if the aclu testing were 100% biased toward exoneration and even if every single innocent person has now been exonerated by it, both of which are impossibly unlikely, it still means at least 17 innocent people were on death row. Even at that rate there is a far higher percentage of innocent people on death row than citizens murdered in the street. By orders of magnitude.<p>Even if it were just 17, it means there were more innocent Americans on death row than have died in terrorist attacks this entire decade. If we know there are terrorists in the world then we should at least be aware there is something wrong with parts of the trail system.<p>4.>if the prosecutor would only let you plea to the charge/punishment he thinks you&#x27;d get at trial no ones would ever plead out!<p>This is why it is done not why it is a good thing to do. We would never justify torture on the grounds it gets more defendants to plead out. So the question is, where is the line of too much coercion and is it currently crossed.

10477086,comment,10476490,10477014,0,0,nbaksalyar,,,"To understand unsafe code you need to understand what&#x27;s safe code and pointers first.<p>Basically, safe code is automatically managed to get rid of memory leaks [0], dangling pointers [1], null pointer dereferencing [2], race conditions [3], and many other memory management bugs.<p>You don&#x27;t encounter any of these in JavaScript because it&#x27;s a managed language, meaning there&#x27;s a garbage collector [4] that looks after all your memory allocations.<p>Contrary to the managed languages, C & C++ are unsafe and &quot;native&quot; (meaning that they&#x27;re very close to the hardware level) - it&#x27;s a wild land where you manage memory manually yourself. If you miss a single deallocation, you&#x27;re left with a memory leak. If you deallocate a memory region twice, you have a double free situation [5]. So you have to be very cautious when writing code in C & C++. There are many techniques to make it easier (e.g. smart pointers [6]), but not all developers use them.<p>Rust takes the middle ground: it combines safety with unsafety by using a know-how affine type system with a borrow checker, which allows values/variables to have only one owner. This system has properties of both managed and unmanaged code. &quot;Unsafe&quot; code in the context of Rust means that you consciously turn off the borrow checker, leaving on your own and managing memory deallocations manually, as in C. That makes it possible to interface your Rust code with the native code, at the cost of making you prone to all errors and bugs that are listed above. So it&#x27;s a good thing to minimize usage of unsafe code, to allow the Rust compiler to check your code for safety.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer#Dereferencing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer#Dereferencing</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_s...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21057393/what-does-double-free-mean"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21057393/what-does-double...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer</a>",1446201747

10477083,comment,10476490,10477014,0,0,ekidd,,,"In languages like C and C++, you have precise control over memory allocation and pointers. If you want to say, &quot;My data structure should contain exactly <i>these</i> bytes, and be located <i>here</i>&quot;, then you can easily do so. This low-level control makes C and C++ very fast. Similarly, the language does very little &quot;behind your back.&quot; It&#x27;s why most kernels, interpreters, web browsers, compilers and AAA games are still written in a low-level language like C or C++.<p>But this control comes at a price: You need to be very careful. You need to manage memory manually, you need to avoid accidentally writing into memory you don&#x27;t own, and so on. Overlooking small details results in security bugs.<p>Rust attempts to provide the same low-level control as C and C++, but it adds safeguards which keep you from shooting yourself in the foot. In &quot;safe&quot; mode, all of these safeguards are fully engaged. In &quot;unsafe&quot; mode, Rust allows you to do some sketchy things. The idea is to use as much safe code as you can, and only use a tiny amount of unsafe code if you need to do something Rust can&#x27;t prove to be safe.<p>For example, there&#x27;s a great series of blog posts about writing a toy OS kernel in Rust: <a href=""http://blog.phil-opp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.phil-opp.com/</a> The author uses some assembly to set things up, and a tiny amount of &quot;unsafe&quot; Rust to directly access VGA memory. But all the higher level code is safe, which rules out a whole class of bugs.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve spent a lot time using both C++ and functional languages. And for me, Rust hits a sweet spot: I can get down to the metal when I want, and I can build nice abstractions. And I can write almost all my code in &quot;safe&quot; mode, and not worry about dumb pointer bugs. It&#x27;s an interesting combination and it makes me want to hack on new things. :-)",1446201664

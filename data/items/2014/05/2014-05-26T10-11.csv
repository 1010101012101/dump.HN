7799299,comment,7798918,7799161,4,0,danielbarla,,,"Interesting points.<p>I think you&#x27;re being slightly too bitter / cynical regarding the &quot;how it is now&quot; section.  Certainly, my own upbringing included logic, reasoning, and questioning things, although I suspect many parents feel that this kind of thing might undermine their authority.  My siblings and I were even provided with (at the time) prohibitively expensive Commodore 64s to foster our own &quot;research&quot; and exploration, leading us to discover (or rather, stumble upon) basic programming before our teens.  And yes, a single counter-example might not mean much, but I&#x27;ve seen many others with similar, fortunate upbringings.<p>I suspect a similar thing applies to your &quot;system&quot; comments.  First, I&#x27;d add &quot;re-inventing things&quot; to the list of stuff we&#x27;d like to avoid.  This is a big one; in my experience most people don&#x27;t seem to have an idea about how deeply things have been researched in various directions already.  As a simple example, I recently had a colleague re-invent the concept of a consumer price index, and pitch it as something brand new.  As time goes on, this will just get worse and worse.  In this sense, I&#x27;d add the ability to review the state of research in a particular area, the ability to perform and document research in a way that&#x27;s repeatable, and these types of things to the wish-list.  It just seems to me that most people pushing for more innovation in research don&#x27;t seem to value these things very much.<p>EDIT: So really, the question for me would be whether the current approach of upbringing as well as strict research career paths do more harm (by stifling innovation) than good (by preventing people from doing bad science).  Who knows.",1401101994

There is very little evidence that ubiquitous use of the protocol is even a secondary consideration -- in fact, the &quot;they can just keep using HTTP/1.1&quot; mantra has been repeated quite often throughout many\nof the discussions here on this, usually as a way of brushing aside many of the concerns that have been raised.

The application compatibility layer?<p>In the past we had operating systems with network stacks and shared libraries for working with application protocols. Now we have browsers with network stacks and JavaScript libraries for working with application protocols. Wasn&#x27;t it just a few days ago that someone was proposing an OS that would do just enough to boot a browser, and then let the browser handle most of the &quot;traditional&quot; operating system tasks? How long before we see a proposal for &quot;lowering&quot; WebSocket connections to the TCP layer?<p>This is what I mean when I say that we risk finding ourselves 20 years in the past. HTTP isn&#x27;t ubiquitous because it is better. It&#x27;s better because it is ubiquitous.

Personally, I don&#x27;t have the room in my head for it; there far more important thing to try and remember, and trying to keep track of lies would eat up way to much wetware.<p>You must have a, ah, very narrow conception of what a lie is.<p>I mean, sure, most of us don&#x27;t build a complex and self-consistent web of deception where we maintain several different self-consistent models of reality at once.<p>But that&#x27;s not the only sort of lie.<p>The most common substantive lie, I think, is the &quot;tell them what they want to hear&quot;  lie.<p>E.g. &quot;are you working?&quot;  alt-tab &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m working&quot;<p>Or even more commonly, checking personal email, facebook, or a webcomic on work time, and still putting that &#x27;8&#x27; on your timesheet.<p>For me?  I don&#x27;t do this on things that matter, and for me, work matters.   e.g. if you ask if I&#x27;m working, but I&#x27;m on HN? I say,  &quot;No, I&#x27;m screwing off&quot;   If I&#x27;m having a hard time focusing, say, and I spend time on HN, my timesheet will have very few hours on it.<p>But, if you ask &quot;how are you?&quot;  Quite often, I will say &quot;fine&quot; even if it is a lie.  I excuse this lie by explaining it away as a greeting, but really?  I don&#x27;t want to spend time with a non-standard but more truthful answer, most of the time.<p>But a lot of people give the expected answer, even when the answer is a little bit important.  This is the sort of lie that most people tell.",1401098590

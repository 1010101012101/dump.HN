211756,comment,211630,211630,0,0,hbien,,,"I really like jQuery because it's lightweight but I think it really fits your needs perfectly.  For DOM manipulation in jQuery you just use CSS selectors, so... :<p><pre><code>    $('a.hide_these').hide();
</code></pre>
Would hide all anchors with class 'hide_these'.  You don't have to do any iterations or pass any anonymous functions.  Traversing works the same way too:<p><pre><code>    $('a.hide_these').parents('p')
</code></pre>
Would find all the paragraph tags that are parents to those anchors.<p>I've only used a few animations from jQuery (like sliding/fading) but the framework also lets you do your own custom animations using CSS (your element will gradually morph to the styles you define).",1212880062

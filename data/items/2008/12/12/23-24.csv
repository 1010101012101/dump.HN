396274,comment,396186,396186,0,0,bd,,,"On the related note: how do you keep track of which comments are new since your last visit of the thread?<p>HN/reddit system with comments jumping around based on votes makes it hard just to quickly skim for differences.<p>Could there be a way to highlight not seen items? I found this a big help for information overload on the sites that do it (e.g. Google Reader, Bloglines).<p>However, I couldn't figure out how to do it elegantly (i.e. not needing to keep state on the server for each user) for prioritized threaded comments systems like HN/reddit.<p>For updates of a single page it's easy, you just need to bake timestamps for each item and page creation into HTML/JS and check them against the last page timestamp stored in the cookie.<p>But this system breaks down for multiple pages, as each one would need own cookie entry, otherwise any site visit would mark all new items as read.<p>That's btw MetaFilter's problem with highlighting new comments. Though there it's easier to follow the conversation due to linear nature of comment system.<p>Maybe the solution could be to have some dual way of accessing comments? Like prioritized threaded view for the first view and linear time ordered view for subsequent following?",1229126004

Apple could implement a service, where certain code could execute, with each application allocated constrained time slices.  Compile the registered callbacks to run on top of a VM, and you can make it impossible for an App to resource starve the system or crash in obnoxious ways.  App writers would have a very strong incentive to create frugal callback functions so that they can be assured of consistent results.  (Otherwise one function call could span multiple time slices.)",1229125793

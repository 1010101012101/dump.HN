Y'know what 90% of their daily time is spent on?  Compiling golden sets.  Labeling training data.  Running MapReduces to collect basic statistics about their data set.  Running MapReduces to identify representative members of their data set, and outliers that should be excluded.  Shoving data into R to visualize it.  Futzing with numeric coefficients.  Building webpages and tools so they can visualize the data and results, futz with the numbers online, and get feedback in real time.  Collecting test sets and running your algorithm against them, and then trying to figure out why your losses are losing.<p>Machine-learning from a practitioner's POV is not at all like the textbooks and theoretical papers suggest.  I'd estimate that less than 10% of one's time goes into the ""fun"" part of machine learning - brainstorming new signals and writing the code to extract them and feed them into your classifier - and 90% is on the kind of grunt work that hard science grad students do all the time.

In fact, we're trying to make the market even free-er: right now the supply of labor is rigid (everyone must work to live) but supply exceeds demand so the free market sends the price of labor to 0. There are two alternatives: let the supply of labor drop via BI or establish price controls on labor (or pray for the economy to keep growing, but that ship has sailed). Price controls shift the problem around and don't solve the underlying issue: supply exceeds demand. Unfortunately, we have chosen price controls over letting the market equilibrate itself.<p>ANY solution that solves the supply-exceeds-demand issue of labor MUST either create leeches (decrease supply) or continuously grow the economy (increase demand).

These are polymorphic: there are different implementations of these for different data structures (list, vector, map, etc). So a dispatch step is required to choose the right one. In clojure-jvm, this is implemented using a java interface; this means the jvm will inline calls to said methods when they're being used in a tight loop. And if you use the standard library, calls to 'first' and 'rest' are going to be inside nearly all of your inner loops.<p>Compare this to a normal lisp or scheme: 'first' and 'rest' (or 'car' and 'cdr', whatever) are monomorphic. They only work on the linked-list data structure. So compiling these directly down to C functions makes perfect sense and incurs no performance penalty.<p>So in summary: clojure assumes theres a really smart JIT which is helping things along. This means it's not as suitable for alternate compilation targets as you might want it to be.<p>I wonder if there's something clever you could do here. Vtables could be reordered based on expected usage, certainly. Clojure can already do some measure of type inference, so this could be used for AOT inlining when it's available. Even if it's not, perhaps several versions of a call could be speculatively generated based on what the compiler <i>does</i> know already. The normal polymorphic inline caching technique could perhaps be abused to apply here. But it's hard to see how any of this can work in absence of a profile or heavy hinting.<p>(not a compiler writer, just interested in the problem)",1367717789

On a related note, his book <i>Zero To One Million</i>[1] is also excellent.<p>That said, Ryan presents one <i>possible</i> model in this post, for how to structure and sequence things.  I'm believe there are very probably other equally acceptable models, and maybe even some that are better (depending on the circumstances).<p>In our own case at Fogbeam, we are much further along on the ""build your product"" dimension, but haven't assembled an advisory board (although we do <i>have</i> advisors and people that we'll probably invite to join our advisory board eventually.  So I guess what I really mean is that we don't have a <i>formal</i> advisory board) nor have we done anything about ""find a place to work"" unless you count ""work from our respective homes and the occasional visit to Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, or Panera Bread"".  Certainly we don't feel the need to rent office space or anything yet.<p>OTOH, I can't endorse the bit about ""keeping expenses to a minimum"" enough.  I know I keep quoting this, but I am heavily inspired by pg's ""How Not To Die"" essay[2] and believe in the idea of keeping expenses down to where you have a runway that is - essentially - infinite.  Of course, the runway may be infinite but the ""window of opportunity"" may not be, and you have to be making forward progress somehow.  But if you can find a way to move forward without spending much money, I say go that route.<p>FWIW, to illustrate with an example, here's how much we spend at Fogbeam:<p>salary: $0 - both co-founders are working for equity only (we both work day jobs to pay the bills)<p>development costs: $0 - both co-founders are developers, so we write code ourselves<p>rent: $0 - see above.  We work from our homes and/or public locations, or the local hackerspace, etc.<p>Github: ~$50.00 / month, IIRC.  We have a low-end paid Github account for our few private repos (most of our repos are public though, since we're an Open Source company!)<p>Hosting: ~120.00 / month.  We maintain a couple of VPS's at Rackspace for miscellaneous services.  We host our website, a SugarCRM instance, Bugzilla, a Mediawiki instance, FUCIT - our ""competitive intelligence"" tool - and one or two other things.<p>Hoovers: $89.00 / month - We had been using Hoovers for free through NCLive, but I just signed us up for a paid account so we can use some features we couldn't get from the free version.<p>LinkedIn: ?? I don't remember, but I maintain the low-end paid LI account.  Let's call it $50.00 / month, I don't think it's much more than that, if any.<p>So basically, it costs us $300 / month right now, plus infrequent expenses like copying and printing, domain name renewal, and renewing our company registration with the Secretary of State.  And I can keep paying $300.00  / month out of pocket essentially indefinitely, as long as I have a dayjob.<p>Now starting this summer, as we get more aggressive about trying to land our first few paying customers, costs will go up some.  I just paid about $150.00 for a list of contacts from Hoovers (above and beyond the monthly subscription) and on-site meetings with customers will entail some travel expenses.  But that's exactly why we're focusing on customers in North Carolina to start, so that we don't incur large travel costs jet-setting around the world.  Realistically, we aren't trying to do business with companies in Abu Dhabi, or South Africa, or England, or probably anywhere outside the continental USA.  And we're really more interested in sticking to NC, and maybe VA, SC, TN, GA, etc. for the short-term future.  Again, keep costs and overhead low, until we can demonstrate some traction, then we can start looking at what happens next (do we try to raise venture money, etc.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Million-Built-Company/dp/0071496661"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Million-Built-Company/dp/0071...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html</a>",1367716456

A huge document like this kind of deters people at best, or at worst convinces them to worry about the wrong things at the wrong time.<p>I don't really feel like going through every single point, but e.g. the advice to do non-standard vesting is bad (4/1 is standard, and even if you think 6/3mo is better, it is worse by virtue of being non-standard), and the ""advisory thing"" is really not something you need at all.  There's a lot of focus in the early part on stuff which is non-productive.  (I stopped reading before the later stage).<p>A lot of advice needs to be highly specific to time and place.

It is in fact the equivalent of asking you to prove that an XML parser after serializing a DOM tree and then parsing that same document produces a non-equivalent DOM tree to the original.<p>I think the reason pat_punnu is balking at what you have said is because of this: You can think of C as a serialized form of an AST. In order for parsing to produce a non-equivalent AST to the one used to serialize it, the C grammar must be non-deterministic. The C grammar is not non-deterministic, therefore what you said does not make sense and pat_punnu (somewhat rudely) asked you to back up what you were saying.<p>Asking people to back up what they have claimed is part of intelligent discourse. This happens often on HN and is one of the reasons I like this community because when the person who makes a non-intuitive or seemingly wrong remark turns out to be correct, I learn something.<p>UPDATE: I should point out that I'm responding specifically to this sub-thread of the tree and not arguing about whether or not this should target the LLVM IR.

At the moment I'm building a Pascal compiler in Clojure for course work and when the time came to do byte code generation the first thing I looked to was the LLVM infrastructure both for ease of use and because it would trivially provide me with the ability to target non-x86 platforms.<p>The reality of the matter is that interacting with non-java linked libraries is a real pain from every JVM language know of. Two years ago this was posted here [<a href=""https://github.com/jasonjckn/llvm-clojure-bindings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jasonjckn/llvm-clojure-bindings</a>], but since then LLVM has gone through two major restructurings so it didn't work out of the box and I estimated that it would take less effort to build my own naive infrastructure than to patch this one & integrate it.<p>As a result I'm generating code in terms of lists of newline terminated assembly statement strings that I can just print or write to a file when I'm done. While I agree that C is a sub-optimal output format in that you have to compile the output, it is also the clear lingua franca for systems programming and assembly generation these days.

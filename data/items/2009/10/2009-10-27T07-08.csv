905077,comment,904193,904193,0,0,thinksketch,,,"Twitter is the “Atari Pong” of real-time messaging services?<p>I remember how exciting it was back in February when I started realizing what it meant to have a real-time messaging protocol.
<a href=""http://www.thinksketchdesign.com/2009/02/25/design/algorithm-design/from-microblog-to-network-protocol-how-twitter-will-redefine-the-internet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinksketchdesign.com/2009/02/25/design/algorithm...</a><p>How magical!  Imagine all the strange and wonderful things we could do with it - like water our plants automatically!  But I'm going to have to guess that twitter has seen its heyday.  Twitter has been fueled by the exciting idea of a real-time protocol - and that idea will truly shape the next generation of the internet.  But that idea is here now and it's going to outgrow twitter in a hurry.  The idea of a real-time protocol is going to be the backbone of the next internet-merged-with-mobile-cellular-satellite-and-wireless-mesh-network revolution.  Every device will talk directly to any other device.  The ISPs will be the next media giants of this year - scrambling to hold onto their market models as the internet as we know it dissolves into the fabric of the technological landscape powered by open source network communication software and ad-hoc device-to-device mesh networks.  Twitter has been a real inspiration, but I just don't see them growing and adapting to be the driving force to carry this revolution.  Thanks, twitter, but I'm looking to google wave now as a protocol that has real potential to be the backbone structure for the next-gen internet.  Or hey - prove me wrong.  It definitely seems like a good move to reach out for fresh ideas at ycombinator.<p>More on google wave - and annotated video clips that summarize the google wave demo video:

You need to understand that my rejection of the ethics argument in this case relies on this assumption that the efficacy is not proven. If the flu vaccine were proven to be effective I would agree with all your ethics arguments.<p>What I find puzzling though is that the proof of efficacy should be prevented by the unproven claim of efficacy. Once a sufficient number of experts is convinced, for whatever reason, that something works, we would be prevented forever from finding out whether that's actually the case.

905068,comment,904765,904765,0,0,jbr,,,"I've been playing go on and off for over ten years now and _heartily_ recommend anyone remotely interested in learning to sign up for kgs (<a href=""http://www.gokgs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gokgs.com/</a>) and download the java client.  There is a fantastic community there, including a few beginner rooms.  Often, people will stay after and review the game with you, which is basically a free lesson.  People are consistently polite and respectful on kgs, which I can't say of other go networks (igs, for example).  Additionally, it's really easy to get a quick match whenever you want with someone appropriately ranked, and it figures out your rank as you play people.<p>If you're going to play in person, try to play smaller boards, like 9x9, so you can get a sense of tactics and local patterns.  Mark_h said it already in this thread, but I'll repeat: lose your first fifty (or more) games as quickly as possible.  When you're first getting started, the goal is just to get a handle on how play progresses, not to win.  Getting comfortable losing makes it easier to learn.<p>Web resources I can recommend: <a href=""http://playgo.to/iwtg/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://playgo.to/iwtg/en/</a> and <a href=""http://senseis.xmp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://senseis.xmp.net/</a><p>Please feel free to find me on kgs, username jrothstein.  I'd love to help share my love of the game with other hackers.  Also feel free to contact me (info in profile) with any questions about the game or for a review (I'll try my best).",1256629559

Some of them involve libraries, but the fact that people are engineering libraries to do those things means there is actually a need for those things in the enterprise community.

I've done mixins & meta-programming at ""enterprise level"" jobs using Java before (Barclay's Bank), but the code is much more verbose and uglier than languages that support it natively.<p>My guess is that you haven't actually done enterprise-level jobs using those languages before, otherwise you probably would have seen many of those standard techniques used in the so-called ""blub"" languages of C, C++, and Java, even if the language didn't provide the feature natively.",1256628450

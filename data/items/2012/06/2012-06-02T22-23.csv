For one, you may need to scale by population, since obviously if there were only 1,000 people in Israel then we're probably overpaying. Our military support to Israel comes out to about $400 per Israeli resident, while the TSA spend is $26 per American resident. (BTW, as far as I could tell, we send military aid to Israel and make an additional several billion in ""qualified loan guarantees"", but that's all the direct financial support we do these days. There are other types of support than financial.)<p>But it doesn't work that way either, since US military support sent to Israel also comes back to purchase US weapons.<p>Yet another way to think of it is that Israel's military budget is $13 billion and revenue is $61 billion, so we pay for about 25% of their military funding and 5% of their total budget. Or another is that our $3 billion is about 1.2% of their $235 billion GDP.<p>But it doesn't work that way either, since we support Israel for geopolitical reasons, and for reasons specific to US internal politics, and therefore get other things from our support.<p>In any case, simply comparing the US aid to Israel with the amount we spend on other projects trivializes the matter. I believe moistgorilla was asking why our many years of significant contribution to their budget doesn't give US citizens special leeway when entering Israel, rather like how citizens of Poland complain how despite having provided material support to the war effort in Iraq they still aren't part of the US Visa Waiver program, or how Iraqi interpreters are still waiting for the US visas they were promised.",1338677423

4059422,comment,4058663,4058663,17,0,dalias,,,"Addressing afhof's comments...<p>1 & 2. I don't see any reason to believe there will ever be a new machine with non-power-of-two word size, and I'm doubtful that there are even any historical post-standardization C implementations like that. Certainly Linux, which makes much bigger assumptions about word size and the relationship of types, will never support such hypothetical systems. Generality is good if it buys you anything practical, but my approach has been to avoid excess generality unless it has a practical benefit. This approach has been very beneficial in the dynamic linker, wherein assuming that things that are the same on real-world archs actually are the same, the amount of per-arch code to maintain is only some 30 lines (which might grow to 60-100 once TLS is supported), as opposed to many hundreds or even thousands in other implementations.<p>At this point, musl does not have official documentation/manual. When it does, these sorts of requirements as well as all the implementation documentation required by ISO C and POSIX will be documented.<p>3. The casts are all necessary (C does not define implicit conversions between pointer types) and correct. Casting to (void *) rather than an explicit type is my preference because it reduces duplication of the type in multiple places, but in any case this is purely a stylistic matter and has nothing to do with the generated code or correctness.<p>4. The ONES macro was leftover from other files on which this code was based (strchr and strcpy). Obviously it's not needed in memcpy which copies a fixed number of bytes without searching for any terminator character, so it could/should be removed. Thanks for catching this.",1338677049

I expect Metro Apps to be hugely successful in the workplace over the long term - Microsoft has a single toolchain which will work from cloud to desktop to mobile - there's going to be demand for those skills.<p>To put it another way, if Metro apps get 10% acceptance in the Windows community that's a bigger market than Linux and perhaps OSX.",1338676205

New apache vulnerability? Your problem. Operating system upgrade? That's you, too.<p>What about security? Do you know all the ways that bad people can get into your system? How do you lock it down? Do you know how to properly configure the firewall?<p>What about a hardware failure? Now you're running back and forth from Fry's to your datacenter. Or in a VPS - you're going to have downtime while your provider moves your VM to another box. Depending on the scale of the outage, you could be down for a long time. Ugh.<p>Yes, Heroku is more expensive than your own hardware. So are tons of other VPS/VM hosting facilities out there.<p>Personally, I also really like RailsMachine.

I had these observations while looking through memcpy.c:<p>1.  Assumption of power of 2 word size.   The ALIGN macro is defined as one less than the size of size_t (which should be enough to hold the length of something in memory).  I would be more comfortable with it being defined as the the size of a processor WORD rather than as a length of memory.<p>2.  Using the ALIGN macro in calculations of misaligned memory copies.  This goes to #1's point:  Suppose the word size is not a power of 2?  Suppose the word size is 6 octets rather than 4 or 8.  The & mask might produce incorrect results since there would be 0's in the mask.<p>3.  There seems to be a lot of casting going on where it either shouldn't be or it looks wrong.  A good example of this is the cast to void on line 19.  If there is a cast, why isn't to the (size_t*) type?  Even if this is correct, I now have to think a lot more about it, or hunt through the commit log.  Yes, I could.  No, I shouldn't have to.<p>4.  The ONES macro is unused, and the ALIGN MACRO are not part of a header somewhere.  An alignment macro seems like it might be beneficial in other parts of the library.  I recognize that this increases interdependency, but I feel it may be justified since it would be useful in other place, and may be changed in the future.<p>I am very pleased that this library is being developed.  I think competition drives up the quality of code, and libc is one of the places where high quality code is invaluable.  (Looking at the comparison chart they provided was impressive!)  I must admit I don't have good solution to the issues I found, so I'm afraid my criticism may not be as constructive as I would prefer.<p>Thanks for making this, it was quite pleasant to look at non Drepper'd libc code. :)<p>Here is the link I looked at for reference:

Apologize to the community, apologize to WhosHere before you get smacked with a defamation suit, and hire a damned lawyer to deal with your <i>legitimate</i> trademark and breach of contract lawsuit in a court of law instead of wasting time dancing around in the court of public opinion.",1338674687
4059327,comment,4059249,4059249,34,0,rdegges,,,"So, I've actually had completely the opposite experience using Heroku.<p>I work at a telecom company that heavily relies on python (and Django) for our front-end and backend--and processes millions of API requests per month.<p>Initially--we started out running our entire web stack on our physically colocated hardware. This was a tremendous pain for us, for numerous reasons:<p>- Investing in hardware requires lots of time to shop around, purchase hardware, and do capacity planning.<p>- It requires physical work (in our case, multiple trips across the US) to setup / provision / bootstrap our servers.<p>- Automatic maintenance (through puppet, in our case) required constant meddling to handle edge cases, and robbed us of hundreds of man hours in the process.<p>- Regardless of how excellent your puppet (or chef scripts) are, you will unquestionably have to do a lot of maintenance work to keep things running smooth through OS updates, new software releases, etc.<p>- Scaling up on hardware is a pain for small companies, as it requires so much time and supervision.<p>I made the choice to migrate all our stuff to Heroku after an enormous comparison of services available (we actually migrated to Rackspace for a while before Heroku), and finding myself completely unsatisfied with options.<p>Moving to Heroku was an incredibly great decision for us:<p>- Our operations time went from hundreds of hours per month to none.<p>- With our extra engineering time freed up, we released numerous new features in the following two months and doubled our userbase.<p>- The cost for running our web infrastructure dropped by a significant portion, not only because of engineering time saved--but also because it was incredibly easy to scale up (and down) our entire infrastructure when needed, as opposed to wasting money on static physical resources that can't be adjusted for need.<p>- Our bandwidth cost dropped to 0 (bandwidth is provided free on Heroku).<p>- We don't have to run any duplicate services, since we can rely on Heroku's load balancer, dyno dispatcher, fully managed databases, and monitoring (via newrelic).<p>- We have automatic (free) database backups via Heroku's pgbackup service.<p>- We can instantly add read slaves, test changes on duplicate masters, etc. (all for free).<p>In regards to the 'poor performance' mention in this article--since there is no data or numbers listed, I can only assume that the author didn't have any monitoring software or management software setup. I've found that using newrelic (a Heroku addon service) gives you more than enough detail and granularity to see how your dynos perform, which tasks take up CPU, which tasks take up memory, and how to properly handle capacity planning.<p>All in all--I feel like this is a good topic for an article, but that it seems to be poorly researched. Sure, hardware can outperform a cloud service if you compare a virtual dyno to a physical server--but at what cost?<p>- High upfront purchasing cost.<p>- Physical maintenance required.<p>- Operations work required.<p>- Must implement your own redundancy of services (backup load balancer, backup database, backup caching servers, etc.)--these all add extra hardware costs.<p>- Custom monitoring solutions must be implemented.<p>- No automatic recovery from faults.<p>- Large time investment to keep things running.<p>I disagree with the premise that 'The cloud is not for you.' I'd actually argue that the opposite is true.",1338674679

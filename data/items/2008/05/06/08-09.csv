(In fact, a few probably are by any non-hacker's definition, including Windows vs. Linux.) I didn't take it out of context, I simply seconded someone who pointed out that you were contradicting yourself.",1210063119

Have you watched TV lately?<p>This is something that is very interesting to the majority of the audience here, even if it is distracting from actually creating a startup. There is nothing you can do to stop this discussion. We are discussing one of the biggest things to happen in the history of Big Internet. Ask more interesting questions if you want to engage the community, hackers are not interested in accounting questions. Ask your accountant.",1210062514

I have seen many a good link lost in a flood of (in my opinion) dross. At quieter times new posts pause for sufficient time to attract some attention - you need the first two or three votes to get to the lower ranks of the front page and thus come to a wider audience.",1210062204

182289,comment,181513,182064,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"True of maybe half of those features...but the other half?  Well, if you don't know enough to miss them, I don't have any way to argue with you--there's no common language in which we can converse about them.<p>But, I feel uncomfortable every time something I write takes two or three times the lines of code because of what the language lacks.  First class functions or lambdas, closures, and a good library fall into this category...and PHP fails on all of them (there are many PHP libraries, but most are buggy and rather scary, and the standard library has ad hoc'ery written all over it...I like for the standard library to at least be a little bit planned out rather than crammed in via 3000 or so functions in the same name space).<p>But PHP is a perfectly valid language for many classes of problem.  Just be careful not to use it for the classes of problems for which it is extremely poorly suited.",1210061109

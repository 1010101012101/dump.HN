59238,comment,59130,59222,0,0,paulgb,,,"I'm a student who will soon (spring/summer) be looking for an internship with a start-up, so I was reading this from the other point of view trying to figure out how start-ups recruit so I would know where to look. As it turns out, I am in Waterloo as well.<p>I've been wondering for a while how much of a disadvantage I am in terms of getting an internship like this because I am not in the co-op program (besides advice and employment courses), as an employer do you give this much thought? (sorry to go off topic; I have talked to students about this but I figured I should jump at the chance to ask an actual employer.)<p>By the way, any chance you will be at BarCamp?",1190689140

All you are trying to do is develop a web app, take the easiest path.<p>Finally,when your app gets complex and you need to hire programmers, you will thank me for this advice",1190688812

59225,comment,59130,59207,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The ""because they are cheap"" comment is definitely problematic.  The best people are smart enough to know they have value.  Of course, picking the best people is still a problem--no matter how much money is on offer, idiots will apply in larger number than great people (because great people are often being well-treated in their current position).<p>But the ""if they turn out to be an idiot it's easy enough to get rid of them"" is a big bonus for smart people.  I've left contracts and jobs because the people around me weren't smart enough, or ambitious enough, to be doing the job they were hired to do, and yet they weren't cut loose.  I don't want to screw around on a job where I know great things aren't going to come out the other end.<p>It may be hard to grasp everything everyone on the team is doing, and to know whether they're great at what they do (particularly if the project is large and has many individual pieces), but if you find yourself doing more work because of stupid stuff one of your team-mates is doing, it's a good sign that something isn't right.  I don't know any great developer that enjoys that.",1190686489

59222,comment,59130,59207,0,0,axiom,,,"I can see how that may have come off as cynical. Let me clarify.<p>We are based in Waterloo, Ontario. We will be hiring an intern from the University of Waterloo. Waterloo has an all co-op engineering program (at the cost of having no time off for students, and a 5 year program.), so even if you're hiring a 2nd year intern the guy already has a year of experience at 3 different companies (not bullshit experience either, but serious engineering work at Google, Microsoft, nVidia etc.) So when I said interns were cheap I meant that we get a bargain for the level of experience the guy has.<p>When I say interns are easy to get rid of, I simply mean that the guy can seem downright brilliant in an interview, and have a solid resume, but turn out to be useless on the job. So it's nice to know that the worst cost you will incur is 4 months salary, and none of the paperwork associated with firing a full timer.<p>---------------\nTangent\n---------------<p>Funny story. I was working at a software startup in Waterloo not too long ago and we were looking to hire. We got a bunch of resumes, and we were about to start interviews. One resume in particular was very impressive. The guy worked at Amazon, NVidia, and had just graduated from comp eng (very tough program to get into.) The guy who was going to do the interviewing thought there was something funny about this resume. He couldn't put his finger on it but something just wasn't right. Maybe it was that this guy with a very impressive resume was applying to a low level web development job. Anyway, so he decides to check this guy out. He googles the name, and he gets this: <a href=""http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news%5C2006%5C8%5C8255_image_headline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news%5C2006%5C8%5C8255_image_...</a> \nSuresh Sriskandarajah. The guy was on trial for smuggling weapons for the Tamil Tigers terrorist group in Sri Lanka. That's not all, this guy's court appearance date was set for 10 days after he sent in the resume. I'm not sure what the hell he was thinking he was going to do if we hired him. ""ummmm, sorry guys I'm going to have to take sick leave for the next 5-10 years"" ",1190686261

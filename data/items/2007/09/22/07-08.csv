58290,comment,58244,58269,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"Parsec is indeed a pain in the behind -- it could have been written as a monad transformer (with the current version implemented as a transformation of the Identity monad).  It takes a bit of work to make a monad transforming version out of the Parsec source code, a bit more if you want to generalize it out to support parsing byte vectors (as opposed to linked lists of characters) or other things, and overall it's just a pain, and you end up with three monad transformers atop one another, if you do it ""right.""  So then you think, ""ok, I'll just make a general parsing typeclass so I can newtype derive solid parsing types,"" and then boilerplate instances begin, and that takes O(n^2) code overall, where n is the number of monad transformer typeclasses you want to have playing nice with each other.  And don't get me started on functional dependencies.",1190446577

58283,comment,58244,58244,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"Programming in Haskell is not difficult.  It is easier to program in Haskell than it is in most other languages, or at least the ones I know of.  I don't find Haskell particularly interesting for any of its so-called mind-blowing features, it's just a practical programming language that lets you get stuff done and communicate your intent to the computer.<p>I do not want the programming part to be harder.",1190444983

And hopefully I will become loaded (as if not the majority of the western world already is). But I will always be a Calvinist, not by choice, but by guilt. But I have realized a long time ago, I was not only lucky getting the proper physical and geographical properties, but also getting a real talent in one specific area: abstract reasoning. And so I can do 2 things; Be a volunteer for something in which I am not incredibly good (I'm not so much a 'sensitive' guy) or I could feel obligated to exploit the talent to the best I can (and enjoy it) and earn money of people that are living well enough, and spend that in the best possible way. Then I would be helping the world more. I feel it is everybodies obligation to reach for the best in themselves and use <i>that</i> for the interest of mankind.<p>Cornelius\n",1190444819

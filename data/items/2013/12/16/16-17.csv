6916017,comment,6914696,6914696,1,0,thebiglebrewski,,,"Ok, although I fundamentally tend to disagree with much of American military policy - if there were people on that bus who had ties to Al Qaeda and american intelligence knew this...and those people were to cause further destruction if they weren&#x27;t killed...then I just don&#x27;t know.<p>I kind of imagine this like all of those movies about drug cartels where these incredibly rich families are leading semi-normal lives and then during a normal family event like a wedding, are attacked by the rival drug cartel. It sucks and looks really bad, but if you got involved in something illegal like Al Qaeda or the drug trade on a massive scale...didn&#x27;t you kind of bring it on yourself?<p>Either way, more evidence needs to be shown for these kinds of attacks and why they are necessary?",1387213170

6915949,comment,6913879,6913879,12,0,peterhunt,,,"I&#x27;m somewhat surprised that everyone is so anti-management here.<p>First of all, Morning Star seems like a pretty well-run place, but the whole system works because they have the luxury of hiring the right people. This is, of course, the single most important factor in any effective organization. If you don&#x27;t hire the right people or play to their strengths you won&#x27;t be able to pull this off.<p>Anyway, a lot of the reasons listed in this piece look like they&#x27;re sourced from companies with crappy management and I don&#x27;t think they represent the reality of management, at least in a lot of places.<p>At Facebook (the only company where I have experience as both an IC and manager) there are three important things to know about management:<p><pre><code>  * It&#x27;s a parallel track to IC (individual contributor aka hacker). You aren&#x27;t &quot;promoted&quot; to manager. It&#x27;s a lateral move. There are plenty of ICs making more money than managers.\n  * All managers go through &quot;bootcamp&quot; (6-week engineering onboarding) and commit code.\n  * The role of the manager is to basically do all the shitty work so ICs don&#x27;t have to.\n</code></pre>\nI want to stress that third point. If you&#x27;re anything like me, as a hacker you want to be given a well-defined problem (unless the problem is <i>defining</i> the problem) and go off and hack on it for a while with minimal distraction. There are a lot of crappy distractions that come with working in the real world. Here are a few:<p><pre><code>  * Dealing with interpersonal issues\n  * Onboarding new hires\n  * Coordinating engineering efforts and priorities (aka: going to meetings so ICs don&#x27;t have to)\n  * Telling that guy in sales or that gal in product management that we can&#x27;t work on their tasks right now\n  * Dealing with medium-priority bugs during crunch time\n</code></pre>\nIf I&#x27;m shipping a product I don&#x27;t want to deal with any of this stuff as long as I&#x27;m not being micromanaged or feel like a second-class citizen to management.<p>So what managers end up doing is being responsible for all of the shit work so their team can go do what they do best. I&#x27;m actually concerned that this whole &quot;no management&quot; movement is going to lead to less motivated and less coordinated teams as these companies grow.",1387212710

The problem of lack of jobs is systemic, and applies to all professions, with a strong tendency to be even more pressing. Due to automation, software and other things the number of jobs, especially low skilled ones is shrinking. Yes, you can educate yourself, and anyone can/should, but in the end, one quarter of the people will be undereducated just because the bar is higher, and will still not be able to find a better job. We, as a mankind, have to seriously consider radical solutions to this problem, and not focus short term on any specific industry.<p>Should be start decreasing working hours due to productivity increase, or just invent bullshit jobs just to keep people employed? Or to progress to Star Trek economy where people will be provided with all basic needs and work only on what they would like to? I know what I would like to happen, but I also fear what would happen. Talking only about unions, Detroit or any specific industry or place is not going to &quot;fix&quot; the global problem, and that is that the need for jobs is decreasing, and number of people is rising. We should tackle that problem instead.<p>Sorry for rambling, it might only be tangentially relevant to the article and discussion, but what I see in all this cases is just this problem.

No secret conspiracy; that was an open debate that happened in the public sector, and which many Americans were talking about over dinner.<p>Even the actual influencing of decisions to engage in hostilities is so everyday as to be unremarkable.

Do you actively check for multiple installs under the same license i.e. with a registration server? Altova XML Spy used to do this and it quickly got binned after the first year&#x27;s license came up for renewal because they messed up the licensing records (PC crashed, couldn&#x27;t de-register in-use licenses etc, hassle, hassle hassle) and we had developers working in VM&#x27;s for a bunch of different projects all at once. Yes we could defeat the LAN sniffing it did to find out if two copies of the XML Spy were running with the same license, but it was too much effort and we resented having to do this - despite each dev being properly licensed.<p>Vendors such as JetBrains and RedGate license the software to me/company for use by a single developer/user, I don&#x27;t have restrictions such as &quot;you must first remove it from the computer you were using it on previously&quot;.<p>I/we are happy to buy licenses for each developer on our team &quot;using&quot; the software, but not for each and every VM or dev env a single developer is working in.

If you believe that Bitcoin will &quot;take over the world&quot; (metaphorically speaking) purely based on its merit as an electronic payment system, then consider the following:<p>The difference between the cost of printing paper money and the cost of Bitcoin mining is that, to the best of our knowledge, paper money cannot be made significantly cheaper. However, electronic payment systems <i>can</i> be made significantly cheaper than the cost of Bitcoin mining. We already know how to do that from a technical point of view. The hurdles tend to be of a regulatory nature.<p>Those regulations have good reasons to exist, but if Bitcoin becomes sufficiently successful and practical simply as an electronic payment system, one of two things will happen: either, regulation will expand to cover Bitcoin to such an extent that Bitcoin loses advantage, or regulation will be reduced. In any case, there will be a market opportunity for non-Bitcoin systems to provide the same functionality, but cheaper.<p>This would then lead to Bitcoin&#x27;s decline.<p>So <i>if</i> you want to argue that such a decline based on market forces will not happen, you have to have an argument that is not based on Bitcoin simply being an electronic payment system.<p>It seems very popular to argue that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is what gives it a sufficient edge, and that the properties arising from its decentralized nature are impossible to replicate at a lower cost.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that I buy the line of argument that the decentralized nature causes a sufficient appeal. The public at large doesn&#x27;t seem to care too much about that kind of thing.<p>Obviously, it was sufficient to spark the initial uptake of Bitcoin, which seems to have been driven by a mixture of cypherpunks, Libertarian and Austrian ideologues, and drug traders -- all three are groups that care much more about the properties that come with decentralization than the general public. And that initial spark was enough to attract broader interest, which may even be sufficient to carry Bitcoin over into long-term viability in a number of niches (similar to what happened to gold).

There were definitely concepts in algorithm design and data structures that I might not have experienced professionally, professors were really smart and I could go to their office hours and talk about real-world problems, and I think that learning more about math helped me think better.<p>I was (mostly) intelligent about what gen-eds to take and where (at a community college) so that the time and money value was maximized. I think it was a good investment. There are many jobs that you will be locked out of without a degree. Some people might say, all the better, but those environments can also be one of the few places doing something you really want to work on, like a university or national lab. Good luck finding a startup that is doing pure R&D in CS...",1387210540

I finished high school at 14, entered a semester of college at 16 I then dropped out promptly (with straight A&#x27;s) because I found the material to be boring and inaccurate. One teacher was seriously telling students there was no reasonable need for a computer to ever have 64mb of ram. (Perhaps I might of made a different choice had I chosen something besides  a rural community college).<p>In any event I was disillusioned with the whole college experience and started taking on quite a bit of contract work, and over the next decade started/participated in 5 startups. I intentionally chose challenging projects at the edge of my comfort zone to gain experience and build real-world problem solving skills. During this time I built a wide network of connections which gave me the ability to do contract work for several well known companies and exposure to a wide range of technologies and problems.<p>Since documenting some of these experiences on my resume/linkedin in detail a few years ago, I have never had a problem getting salaried jobs or contracts making more than most of my degree-holding peers and getting frequent new job opportunities to consider.<p>I have also been a hiring manager more than once, and have always interviewed people based on their ability to solve real world problems with an actual editor and access to google. I tend to gravitate towards companies that test new applicants this way as well. Companies that dismiss me based on my lack of formal education, I dismiss as well. Companies that judge on paper instead of skill probably lack the diverse workforce I wish to be a part of.<p>As an added story, I have a friend that applied for Google without a degree. He was denied. He actually contacted them back asking why he was dismissed so quickly. He was told it was because he lacked a degree. The end. He had the balls to push back insisting he is capable of doing the job and has plenty of experience. The recruiter relented and pushed him up to the next stages... and he got the job.<p>You don&#x27;t need a degree, but be prepared to network a lot, have a healthy amount of confidence, and be willing to push back against dismissive recruiters. I won&#x27;t say which path is better, because that depends on the individual... but I can say skipping college to focus on real-world experience was one of the best personal choices I ever made.",1387210262

6915587,comment,6912705,6915501,1,0,anoncowherd,,,"Hm. Yeah, I guess that&#x27;s a good point. The idea of property can be thought of as &quot;obligations between people&quot;, but it&#x27;s not the same as the idea of the social contract. For starters, it&#x27;s between individual people, not some collective entity and a given individual, and second, it involves no force as long as no one <i>aggresses</i> against anyone.<p>Another difference is that the &quot;system of property&quot; actually works to everyone&#x27;s favour - quite the opposite of &quot;the social contract&quot;, and imposes no other obligations on you than to not aggress against anyone else&#x27;s property. If &quot;aggress&quot; sounds out of place, let&#x27;s say &quot;interfere with someone&#x27;s (exclusive) control of their property&quot;. There&#x27;s lots of room for pointless bickering in moral issues, etc.<p>There are various sensible ways to view the concept of property. One is Murray Rothbard&#x27;s idea of something becoming your property by &quot;mixing your labour&quot; with it. For example, if you build a house, or plow a corn field, they&#x27;re your property.",1387210174

I do not think this is a state of affairs that we should encourage, or that needs to exist, and companies like Costco show otherwise. I hope that those of us with the means will spend our money in as conscionable a way as we can (ie. not at companies encouraging this).",1387209699

Maybe the pay wouldn&#x27;t  be better, but the could listen to employe grievances better.<p>Do they go out of there way to foster relationships among employees?  Encourage out of work get togethers like Friday happy hour, light team sports?  Groups to visit the local zoo or Japanese Gardens, group outings to a new movie, organize a hobbit marathon, a real marathon or maybe just a 5k?  Groups for board game enthusiasts?  Clans on WoW?<p>The work may be mndane and shitty, but slogging through with friends makes it a million times better.",1387209693

The current system is not automated, meaning that humans need to watch the 4 million feeds. But expert humans miss 95% of events after 20 minutes from a single feed. Imagine how that decays for many cameras per operator.<p>I would love all public officials to wear these cameras. They would need to be on all the time, outside private spaces or security clearance requirements. It should be internet accessible and searchable, with auto-tagging tools for date, gps location, and eventually content.",1184701592

34845,comment,34804,34804,0,0,mynameishere,,,"The word ""troll"" actually goes way back. The artform is actually a bit more dignified than people think now. The first ""troll"" was supposedly Jonathon Swift with his ""Modest Proposal"" pamphlet (the title was posthumous by several hundred years, of course). The basic idea was: You start off by being reasonable, getting people to believe you, and then become more and more extreme until the point of ridiculousness.<p>Now, troll means: Someone who goes and makes obvious, inflammatory statements trying to start arguments.<p>Often, ""Troll"" as used means: Someone who disagrees with the general consensus. That's a dangerous definition.<p>Kos seems to think that a paid political agitator (another old trade) is also a ""troll"" when on the internet. Not so.",1184700455

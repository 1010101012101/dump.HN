And it agrees with the one unique piece of advice I give people who are considering whether to go to work at a new firm, ""Try to determine if they can fire people.""<p>One quibble:<p>""<i>It takes time to glean an employee's pithy attributes: work ethic, intelligence, attention to detail, enthusiasm, even personal hygiene.</i>""<p>You should be able to judge at least initial enthusiasm in your interviewing process or you're not doing a good job of selling your company or it's an impossible sales proposition.  Either of which you should do something about at a high priority.<p>But I'll admit that sustained enthusiasm is what really counts and of course only time will tell WRT to that.  And I'm not sure what you'd do with people who take some time to warm up to a situation (ADDED: well, make sure they've been enthusiastic about at least one prior job; if they're too young to have any/many and are already cynical you'd probably best pass on them :-).<p>For programmers you should be able to get a reading of intelligence and attention to detail in the interview as long as you do minimal testing (perhaps Fizzbuzz, my preferred 3 tests of reverse a linked list (pointers), recursive factorial and find error in this block of code, etc.).<p>Having them work out loud with you a relevant design problem is also good, although recognize that only 1/5 of programmers ""get"" abstraction (according to the Antipatterns book and my personal experience); if you need/can afford having programmers who don't get it, you'll want to gauge their ability to follow orders and ""do it this way"" ""just because"" the architect says so.<p>(There are potentially lots of slots in an organization including a startup for all sorts of competent people, e.g. look at the 2nd <i>Coders at Work</i> interview Brad Fitzpatrick, the Live Journal Founder.  They had an older employee who produced <i>awful</i> code, but they loved him since his forte was quickly figuring out difficult integration problems which no one else liked to do or was good at.  He handed them messy solutions filled with duct tape and bailing wire and they mined the interfaces from them and made clean versions that fit with their system.)<p>Anyway, my advice is to pay close attention to what this author says, just don't let it cause you to significantly relax your hiring system since hiring, working with and then firing duds is <i>always</i> debilitating for all concerned.",1273407801

Consider apprenticing yourself to someone more experienced for a while to figure out what it is that you are missing while hiring, especially if the absolute numbers are high. If you've hired six people in all your time and fired 2 of them then we'll take it as a statistical anomaly.<p>Out of 25 people hired I've had to fire exactly <i>1</i>, but I rejected almost 95% of all applicants to open positions, not limited to the engineering department.<p>I think one big difference in the way we look at this is that if you hire someone you also have a responsibility to them, evaluating fit is something that is <i>your</i> responsibility, and failure is up to you to correct, through teaching, training and mentoring.<p>It seems you think that you have no responsibility for them other than to fire them when you've decided your 'extended interview' is over.<p>In most countries there is an agreed upon 'trial period', which allows an employer to terminate a contract without any penalties, depending on the country these periods last from 30 days to 6 months. But it is actually pretty rare to have to fire someone within that period, even if there does not have to be 'cause' a high firing rate during the trial period reflects bad on the hiring manager.<p>The reason for that is simple economy, hiring people and firing them within 6 months is a very bad investment for the company, that person cost almost as much in time spent getting them up to speed as a person that is productive for multiple years.<p>If you're hiring someone that is out-of-work and down on their luck then you could argue that something is better than nothing and you gave them a chance, if you entice people to leave a job where they've worked for years and you then end up firing because of a mis-judgment them you've caused a real problem.",1273406770

1408336,comment,1407898,1408187,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"There's a fairly diverse crowd of musicians and web developers. The two sets of people aren't entirely separate.<p>I probably go to 5 or so gigs per month. I can't tell you how many new albums I listen to per month. It varies considerably.<p>Usually, bands practice in any space they have available. A few have dedicated practice space; most practice in a garage of one of the members. Most booking is done by knowing someone who knows someone. A lot of shows are set up by some random band, and they find a few other bands that want to play. Very, very few bands actually get paid here to play shows. There are a handful of promoters. My organization (<a href=""http://elpasoera.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elpasoera.com</a>) happens to be one of them. We've also helped organize a few tours. I can think of two recording studios I have connections at off the top of my head, Sonic Ranch being one of them. The other is the recording studio Jim Ward (of Sleepercar and Sparta) recently opened up.<p>We do all the web work for a somewhat successful musician. I'd imagine he, along with his band, makes well over $1000/month. Some people are making a fair bit of money. Most aren't. I find it's rude to ask.<p>I actually repair tube amps from time to time. I also know a guy that's been repairing them for 20+ years. I know people who do live sound professionally. I know drummers, but I'll admit, it is hard to find a decent drummer in this town.<p>So, no, not everyone here is commenting on things they know very little about. Some of us are actually deeply connected to the music industry <i>and</i> web development/entrepreneurial topics.",1275821225

1408324,comment,1407939,1407939,0,0,d_r,,,"I can't upvote this article enough. Perhaps I've seen too many friends put months into a startup, with no clear marketing / post-launch plan. The switch gets flipped, the site goes live, people patiently look at Google Analytics, and ... the users don't come. A couple of months later everyone gives up and goes back to devoting full attention to their day jobs that they never left.<p>That, and the article makes an important point -- if you don't have that many users, it doesn't necessarily mean that your service/app isn't valuable.

1408323,comment,1407605,1408077,0,0,viraptor,,,"Examples I completely agree with.<p>I got used to short functions so much, than my normal function length in any other language went down a lot too. Now I'd probably refactor anything that doesn't fit on half of a screen (got fairly big monitors though). And that's a good thing - the effect is easier to read and the shorter the code is, the more self-documenting it becomes, because you have to name every sub-process correctly via the function name. Something that would otherwise be a 40 line function with inline comments: ""First do this"", ""then do that"", becomes a two-line: do_this(); do_that(); with ~20 lines in each of them. Much much better.<p>On the other hand, once you get too used to lambdas, you start missing them in other languages. It just felt natural for me at some point to make a C macro (f, arr, type, len) which did something like map on an array of `type` using a function pointer `f`. That didn't go very well with other people who normally read that code...",1275820362

In reality, most people have made that choice long ago and we know that they have their consequentialist price. The price may be a million dollars, saving a hundred people's lives, getting revenge or another non-monetary reward, but there is a price. Already before the million-dollar question, we know that we may assume she definitely <i>is</i> 'that kind of girl'. Almost every girl, and every guy, is 'that kind of girl', because they will trade their affections for what the other party offers.

I want to be able to tuck windows away 'in the distance' or twist them round to a slanted pane (so they take up a fraction of the space but are still more or less visible/legible). I also want to step in and out of '3D mode' when making ER diagrams or UML diagrams and such, for when there's too many criss-crossing lines.<p>Undoubtedly these things have already been tried (I saw a nice Linux demo somewhere, years ago, with 3D windows) but I'd like them standardized, and touch-operated.

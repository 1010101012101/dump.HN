It has been done before in programming history (not just C, fortran has been beaten as well <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=200989"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=200989</a> <a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19014-8_11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19014-8_1...</a>     <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.150.640&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.150...</a> although the prior art focuses on Lisp I think Haskell and ML like languages are better equipped for this). Imperative code is a lot harder to reason about, and low level code is a lot harder to write if one cares about correctness and performance simultaneously. Specialized functional languages has a history of beating C implementations. It could be faster still if one removes the constraint that one has to generate C code, for example coroutines and proper tail calls become easier to implement. The bottomline is that correctness is easier to achieve with functional, and performance with imperative. So we would need both and they meet in a compiler.<p>Take the example of Stalin and StalinGrad, they are Lisps. Their compile times are epic, but once done they have a history of generating faster code than C for specific applications (a specific example where it will excel is multidimensional numeric integration where the function to be integrated is passed as an input). The main reason why they would be able to generate faster code is that they are smarter about inlining. The reason they are smarter about inlining is that programmers intent is better preserved when encoded in a higher level language.<p>Can a programmer not write the same code in C by hand ? Sure they can, but it will take longer and would be more error prone and likely to be costlier to produce, unless one takes the help of these higher level abstractions primitives, but then you aren&#x27;t really writing in C anymore. Can the C compiler not be equally smart ? possibly, but it will be a lot harder to make a C compiler smart than a functional language compiler smart. Functional languages leave a lot of room for the compiler to do its thing, C while not as bad as Java still over-specifies how exactly something needs to be computed (my way or the highway). Add the fact that when code is written in a higher level, but optimization friendly language one can enjoy the benefits of compiler techniques yet to come. It future-proofs the code to an extent and amortizes the effort that went into writing the compiler.<p>Now of course one can use C++ template metaprogramming to do much of the inlining that Stalin does, but then again you are essentially using a functional programming paradigm.<p>EDIT: HN easy on the downvote.

For instance, running two threads for a data set that fits in L3 results in a speedup of only 1.75x, rather than 2x. Four threads on one four-core processor results in a speedup of only 2x vs the single-threaded program.<p>- It takes relatively few operations for programs to become compute-bound rather than memory bound. If 8 or more &quot;add&quot; operations were performed per data access, we found that the effects of caching disappeared almost completely, and the program&#x27;s execution was limited by processor rather than the memory bottleneck.<p>The specific magnitude of these results is machine-dependent, but I would expect the general relationships to hold for other machines with a similar cache hierarchy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.stoneridgetechnology.com/uploads/file/ComputevsMemory.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stoneridgetechnology.com/uploads/file/ComputevsMe...</a>",1396835065

I&#x27;m all for decentralized systems but one important consideration which will likely be different for each scenario: is whether distributed consensus in x (ie. traffic lights, water, power) is more valuable to the participants than a statistical machine-learning based approach. The latter is optimized towards some predefined metrics (minimizing total average wait times in traffic), whereas a cryptocurrency approach is distributed to the whims/needs of independent actors (&quot;I want to cross the street now&quot;).<p>The benefits of distributed independent actors is clear in some areas such as economics, where the system is so massive and chaotic attempts to control it via machine or human intervention often fail. Even when they continually adapt their models over time, they will never be a full replacement for the consensus of a market.<p>While markets are efficient they famously at times have a habit of acting irrational and counter-productive to participants needs. This is where in the present times human intervention (occasionally) out-performs pure markets. In the future, most of us expect machine-optimized models to out-perform both markets and centralized systems.<p>That may be the differentiation in the long term for which is better, which can provide the best value? Human consensus -> human consensus via machines -> machine consensus. We&#x27;ll likely keep moving farther to the right of that flow as machine learning (AI) becomes better.",1396834952

They had several languages on this machine -- Fortran IV, I think, which I started to learn so I could help my stepfather with his numerical codes; Snobol, which I didn&#x27;t do much with; a long-forgotten language called CAL, which I learned much later had been created by Butler Lampson of PARC and Alto fame; and a macro assembler.  I&#x27;ll never forget opening the macro assembler manual and seeing an example that started:<p><pre><code>   MUMBLE MACRO\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think I figured out at the time what a macro was or that that this was a declaration of one, and its name was &quot;mumble&quot;.  Nor did I quite realize that &quot;mumble&quot; was just a common metavariable.  These mysteries were revealed later in my education.<p>A couple of years later, my stepfather&#x27;s company switched to using a CDC 6400 via a remote batch terminal, consisting of a card reader, a line printer, a CRT console, and a 9600 bps modem -- many tens of thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of equipment, I&#x27;d guess.  The CRT display would sometimes go on the fritz.  I figured out where to hit it with my hand to make it come back on.<p>I got pretty good at Fortran and started to learn to read the 6400&#x27;s assembly language.  At one point I started to study the optimizing Fortran compiler&#x27;s output.  This made a great impression on me as I couldn&#x27;t imagine how it did some of its optimizations.

Besides the I/O improvements, column-stores benefit greatly from better CPU usage because the data is iterated over by type (column by column), so the same operators stay in the cache. This allows data to be pipelined in to the CPU and processed very quickly relative to traditional row-stores. It can even be efficient to operate on compressed data [1] if the relevant decoding data can be kept in the cache.<p>In case you missed it, there was a relevant article last week about how B-Trees benefit by reducing the number of cache requests.<p>[1]. <a href=""http://db.lcs.mit.edu/projects/cstore/abadisigmod06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://db.lcs.mit.edu/projects/cstore/abadisigmod06.pdf</a><p>[2]. <a href=""http://www.me.net.nz/blog/btrees-are-the-new-black/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.me.net.nz/blog/btrees-are-the-new-black/</a>",1396834090

The US boycott of Cuba is nominally to suppress Communism in the Western hemisphere. That sounds to me like suppressing an idea.<p>You can say that it&#x27;s actually boycotting them for specific actions, and not for the general expression of ideas. That seems like a weak distinction - &quot;faith without works is dead&quot;. Ideas, without the ability to act on those ideas, have no power or influence. They are dead.<p>Your counter-example, where you &quot;boycott <i>opponents of the embargo</i>&quot;, is hard for me to understand without an example. An opponent of the embargo might buy and import a Cuban cigar, in order to protest the embargo. That&#x27;s an action. Under your action/idea distinction, it&#x27;s therefore okay for me to boycott that person&#x27;s action, no?<p>Going back to Eich, Eich did a specific action - donate money to a political cause. That action is the prime, and really only, stated reason for opposition to Eich as CEO.<p>Under your action/idea distinction, don&#x27;t you find that perfectly acceptable?

I’m a mac person and use a $3000 laptop but I know most of them will not be willing to spend this much money. I normally quote them a $600(ish) computer that has at least an i-Series processor and 6-8GB of RAM. I tell them to avoid a couple vendors that I consider to be bottom of the barrel. It never fails though, that for all the reasoning and advice I give them, if they find a computer for $400 in the Sunday paper all that gets thrown out the window. They don’t want a computer that fits their needs they just want the cheapest computer. It also never fails that the moment it starts having problems they come to me for help and if I give them any slack for buying a cheap POS that I am suddenly considered an a-hole for not helping since that’s all they can afford.<p>The way I look at it is I spend my hard earned money on a reliable machine so I am not put out by the type of issues you get with cheap hardware or cheap services and you did not head my advice to avoid the same issues and thus by asking me to give up my weekend or even a couple hours to help you makes you the a-hole not me.<p>I have used, Rackspace, Linode, DO, AWS, and Google Apps among others and none of their status pages are every very helpful.

Now I&#x27;m CPO of a startup and write backend stuff in Ruby.  I rarely get to use any of my old ASM coding chops.",1396832448

Unfortunately it currently leans differently from what <i>I</i> prefer, but perhaps it is close enough that the source code will form a useful basis for what I prefer (no html (and a decent html>text renderer for the brain dead services that don&#x27;t provide (useful) text parts), no rich editing, threaded -- not gmail style conversations).<p>At any rate it seems like a more viable (for me option) than eg hacking on prayer (because, I think it&#x27;s just silly to try and work with something exposed to so much bad user input/data as email -- in C):<p><a href=""http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/~dpc22/prayer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/~dpc22/prayer/</a>",1396832445

7544047,comment,7543158,7543797,4,0,srean,,,"The problem is not so bad if the compilers explain themselves. I run g++ or gcc with --ftree-vectorize-verbose=3. So even if gcc wasnt able to vectorize a loop I get to see which one it failed on and why. This is very valuable and you can often tweak the code to fix the problem. It saves me the trouble of writing intrinsics by hand. A &quot;sufficiently smart programmer&quot; could do better, but they are rare too.",1396832429

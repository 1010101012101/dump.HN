I wouldn't say it would be trivial to crack a password once you have the salt, but it would be much easier.<p>Salts effectively make a password longer, without more for the user has to remember.  The purpose is to make it much harder to make rainbow tables that will be effective on a system that uses salts (Now you have to have a rainbow table that has a hash for every possible salt for just the word ""password""!)<p>Salts are typically stored with the hash, so if you get one, you get the other.  In the case you don't get the salt, well, you're left with a very long salt+password combination to break (good luck).  With the salt, you can break shorter passwords in a reasonable amount of time (depending on how computationally expensive the hash is).<p>With a salted hash, the only real feasible way is to just brute force it.  That's exactly what this NSA@Home thing does.  It just may require a small amount of tweaking to make sure to prepend the salt to every password attempt, but basically it is a very capable hash cracker.",1247627907

705050,comment,704557,704957,0,0,wglb,,,"Well, not sure how to write a compiler that generates machine code without fully understanding the semantics and evolution.  I have done two of them and did not do rigorous mathematical semantic models.  One was an implementation language targeting 8085 with the compiler written in Bliss 36, which had clearly superior semantics, and there was no hint of the corruption that you suggest.<p>I think it would be a fun project to write a pascal compiler in scheme.<p>I argue that there are things that you are likely to run across in generating code that you might not see in mastering the language.<p>See, there are two kinds of study going on here.  One is the study that I have done of emacs, which is what I think the article was talking about and that is starting with a small set of knowledge and expanding bit by bit as you use it in daily life.<p>The other kind of study, which I was trying to illustrate (and apparently failed) is a thorough, directed study (e. g., reading the User Manual and Report until it is about ready to fall apart), or reading the spec for the target language and working with the users closely.  In the second case, we (three of us) wrote the compiler in a year, and just about replaced the use of assembler language in the OS project.",1247627179

Installation is fast, and wordpress seems to run fairly quickly.<p>With the plans starting at $5 a month I imagine you aren't using amazon EC2 to host the virtual machines.

Their normal cooked pasta is 'al dente' for non-Italians, and their 'al dente' is ... soaked in warm water. But good anyway. And do salt the water generously.",1206197948

Living in a beach hut for the rest of my life is just not very attractive to me. I guess it depends on your definition of ""comfortable"" but I'd have to say that I wouldn't want to live in any of the developing countries I've visited. Besides, luxury goods will be imports anyway, and still have western prices.<p>* Will those places that currently have such a low cost of living stay like that for another 60 years? I really doubt it.",1206197752

PG is commenting on what, to him, is the revolting sight of a bunch of apparently smart people wasting time in a pointless ""team-building"" exercise. He didn't think those people looked happy, and he didn't think they looked like people who were wasting their time by choice. They looked like people who... lacked agency!<p>He obviously didn't mean to imply that they'd been <i>forced</i> into their cage.. the entire essay is about how <i>you have a choice about whether or not to be treated like an employee</i>.",1206197647
143314,comment,143232,143232,0,0,Electro,,,"All this shows is that College professors spend an absurd amount of time doing IQ tests compared to Truck drivers.<p>The scientists who came up with the baseline work to study IQ found that correlating it to intelligence was vehemently disgusting. It was used to test how well young children scored on a school cericulum, not intelligence but learning.<p>It doesn't surprise me that MD's are at the top of the list as they're basically glorified encylopedias. They're incompitent, they're poor at their job and I've rarely heard people speak well of them. My mum has intermittent hyperthyroidism, it took almost 3 years for them to figure out they had to take a test when it was acting up to get a result. It's an intermittent condition and the morons didn't know what to do. The ironic thing is that she's a nurse and the doctors she works with told her she had it, but they can't give out prescriptions because of ethics so she was stuck with morons who wouldn't listen to what she said.<p>I saw 3 doctors about 1 skin condition. One said excema, the next said psoriosis and the final said ringworm. Each one had me on different meds for it and none of them worked, the thing that did was going on vacation for two weeks; within the first five days it was gone and hasn't been back since, yet none of them reccomended it and they had me on steroids and antifungals and never even told me that UV would likely clear it up no problem. Not to mention I've had a doctor tell me I'm morbidally obese because of my Body Mass Index when I'm bradycardic, I have perfect blood pressure and low cholesterol; I spent last weekend lifting 120kg wooden beams  2 meters into a roof and didn't even break a sweat. I'd be surprised my MD could lift 10kg, because I've certainly never seen him lift his fat ass out of a chair in 3 years and he has the gall to say I need to lose weight.<p>It took my girlfriends' aunt over a decade to get her doctor to diagnose her with high blood pressure, because he said she was thin enough that she didn't need her blood pressure to be taken. When she finally found a doctor that would do it, she left with a prescription for strong blood pressure medication because the guy was worried she was going to have a stroke.<p>IQ is complete bull and the list looks to correlate more with people incapable of listening or understanding than intelligence. I work as an electrician, yet my first job was in the creative group so near 110 at 16 and IQ results grow exponentially on age till about 21 years. Yet I'm a lot more intelligent now I've been working as an electrician than before, and I know a hell of a lot more.<p>This is inherently useless as people change jobs. My dad went from a milkman to a welder, to an owner/manager of a garage, to a motorbike racer, to an electrical engineer programming the first fuel injection systems in cars, to computer programming when DOS was new and rode that through into .Net and now I'm working with him on property renovation and electrics.<p>So I would really love someone to prove to me that IQ measures intelligence, cause it just seems to prove stupidity to me. MD's are the dumbest people I've ever met, and I need to meet about 90 more to get proof that all the ones I've met so far are a statistical anomaly occuring in a general local area of the bottom 10th percentile.",1206197529

I actually have a blog post in the works that addresses your concerns fairly directly, since they are concerns for me too. Keep an eye out for it. In brief, I recommend you buy a copy of Working Effectively With Legacy Code immediately, then work to get unit tests in place. Make sure you have a couple of tests for each public interface in the system. Once you have rudimentary test coverage, it becomes easier to refactor things without worrying so much about breakage.",1206196975

143294,comment,142723,142723,0,0,cturner,,,"A music performance simulator. The interface would be a bit like command and conquer, but instead of ordering troops around, you'd be setting up violin sections, and mixing recordings of chorister's voices.<p>The Nintendo orchestra simulator is a taste, but my dreams were/are far bolder.<p>Something nice - there is huge crossover in the latin used through much of the choral repertoire. Thus, it's a nicely defined group of samples you would have to record for each singer - would probably only take a couple of hours per singer to get to a point where their voice would slot in and be in effect generic. Perhaps you could break down constonants and 'cambridge vowells' and come up with an even simpler and more flexible sample set.<p>If money were no object I'd also buy a second-hand stone church, build a house on the back, take up serious lessons and se if I could find a way to get an apprenciceship as an organ builder. Maybe get into choral conducting and try and bring music to people who have talent but haven't had the sort of childhood full of exposure. I'd read a lot of economics. I'd like to think I'd get more exercise.<p>Oh - I'd also like to work on an interaction engine at the same level as HTML but far more advanced. I think Silverlight and an Adobe project are trying to address this at the moment, but we really need something that's free software and has a lot of the simplicity of HTML without its suckiness (and with better asynchronous event support).<p>The great thing is that there's so much money washing around the world today that I'm working full time and still getting plenty of time to explore ambitions that are not too far removed from what I've listed above - and what I have written there is my ideal.

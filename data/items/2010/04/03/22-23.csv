1239280,comment,1238542,1239004,0,0,devinj,,,"Er, ""write X in Y"" is a common (and meaningful) snowclone/expression. It means you're not adopting the idioms of the language you're writing in, you're attempting to kludge together the idioms of one language and the syntax of another. For example, writing Java in Scheme could be refusing to use  recursion, map, fold, etc., but instead using loops/loop-analogues and vectors everywhere, trying to craft everything into objects or similar instead of using closures where appropriate, and so on. Basically, writing a messy Scheme version of a clean Java program.<p>Not knowing either Common Lisp or Haskell, I really couldn't comment on the rest, or on specifics in this case. Nor if it even makes sense, or is true in this case (that it's easier one way or the other).",1270335202

Neither one completely ignores any of the hinting or sub-pixel information. The Windows font renderer is optimized to improve Microsoft's idea of readability on moderate-resolution displays. The OS X font renderer is designed to preserve the look of a font more, so that your screen is a more accurate reflection of how it would look on paper. In reality, the readability of large amounts of text is substantially the same across both platforms. (Spacing issues, such as the differences between Word and TeX, affect readability far more at typical desktop resolutions.) The stylistic differences are simply large enough that it can be distracting when you are used to one renderer and you end up in front of another one.",1270335132

1239272,comment,1238665,1238997,0,0,1amzave,,,"I think it goes a bit beyond ""keeping a close eye on""...<p>Apple's employed Chris Lattner (the creator/primary author of LLVM) for a number of years now, and I think LLVM is widely regarded as being a pretty major part of their plans going forward.  (And it's not just Apple, either -- Nvidia's using LLVM for their OpenCL implementation, for example.)<p>As for x86 vs. ARM...in the high-performance single-core/multi-core area (up to say, 8 cores or so), I think x86, ugly as it is, is likely to remain entrenched.  There have been a hell of a lot of dollars and man-hours pumped in to making it (single-threaded) fast over the last couple decades, and in that area it may actually have some technical advantages over a cleaner ISA (such as ARM, though ARM isn't exactly the epitome of RISC purity).  Two things off the top of my head -- a) the instruction encoding, as insane as it is, allows pretty dense code, meaning good I-cache utilization, and b) the two-operand instruction format simplifies dependency-checking and forwarding logic, for which hardware costs run O(n^2)  (where n is proportional to operands-per-instruction and issue width).<p>In the ""manycore"" area though, I think the power and area costs of decoding the x86 ISA will be a more significant disadvantage (this may have something to do with why the power consumption of Larrabee prototypes was rumored to be so enormous).  Tilera, for example, makes manycore chips based on MIPS, which I'd say is a somewhat cleaner ISA RISC-wise (meaning better-suited for small/efficient hardware implementation) than ARM.<p>So, if manycore is indeed the future, I'd say there is definitely hope for avoiding a completely x86-monopolized world...",1270334998

One implies there were many people who did know what they would use the iPad for (in fact, it implies most people knew what they would use the iPad for, as many < most).  The other gives no sense whatsoever of how many people don't know, and could just as easily be two guys or 90% of the people there.  It is also very easily misread as ""The people waiting in line..."", implying all, or almost all.  The title you chose also implies that that paragraph is the emphasis of the story, which it isn't.  The emphasis is on the enthusiasm of the people.  I don't think you meant to misrepresent the article, but I do think you inadvertently did.

So the hack goes like this. Whenever you're feeling down or not particularly cheerful, force your face into a smile, a really big one and hold it for 30 seconds. Really tense up your facial muscles like you're flexing your bicep, but on your face. Empty your mind of all negative thoughts. At some point during the 30 second hold, you'll feel a little happier.

Century Gothic and Trebuchet are a lot harder to read than Helvetica/Arial, and it just looks goofy for something I need to read quickly and dispassionately about 100 times per day.  I really suggest something more utilitarian, e.g., Verdana of HN/reddit would be much better.<p>- The infinite scroll seems like a good idea in theory, but in reality the growing length of the page makes it harder for me to sense the rank of the current link I'm looking at or where I am on the page.  Both Google and Bing tried this kind of display, and abandoned it after a while... Could you at least number your result links?<p>- To add to that, your headings like ""In abbreviations and acronyms"", ""Other Uses"" and ""Web links"" that divide your infinite list are very small, the same color as other text, and easy to miss.  The sections that narrow my search look almost identical to the actual web links.  This makes me do some disruptive context checking to discern whether I am going to another web page or searching for something else on DuckDuckGo.  Note how your and Google's ""Did you mean:"" statement is <i>bright red</i>, you should apply the same elevated importance to your disambiguation sections.<p>- I can't search for an address and immediately see a map of the location.<p>- You don't suggest image results for things that people almost certainly want images for, e.g., animals, celebrities, or landmarks.  I then have to switch to another search engine for that which is an extra step.<p>Overall, I like what you're doing, I just feel like you need to make some serious improvements to match with the UX of Google or Bing!

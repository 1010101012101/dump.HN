The idea of a guaranteed vaccine that hasn't been through trials is nonsense as trials are an integral part of such a guarantee.<p>Second, you can't sue someone for with holding such a drug unless you have some sort of basis in law to have that drug - basically a contract between you and the company. As the drug companies can't legally sell a drug that hasn't passed testing no such contracts exist. While I'm sure you'd like to exert some sort of moral right to the drug (and I'd kind of agree with you), a legal right which could form the basis of a law suit simply isn't there.<p>Third, why would a company sit on a vaccine for AIDS? Yes a majority of those at risk are in the third world and have no money but there is a market of hundreds of millions who could afford and would pay for a vaccine in the wealthy developed world. It simply makes no sense to suggest that they would do anything of the sort.",1301568640

We had a support portal at work which I had to check regularly during the day. I wrote a small program that monitors the relevant page and pops up a taskbar notification when something new arrives. Used the opportunity to learn about taskbar notifications and a little WPF.<p>2. I sometimes get database backups from customers and have to restore them on my machine, which means opening SQL Management studio, clicking and right clicking a bunch of things. Then I need to add myself as user, change a couple of settings before I can use the database for anything. I wrote a small utility so I can right click on any .bak file in explorer, choose Restore database and update the relevant tables so the database is ready to use right away with the connection string on the clipboard. Also used it as an opportunity to learn about windows 7 taskbar progress bars.<p>Basically I like doing small projects, but I never finish them unless they really do something.

2391011,comment,2390801,2390946,3,0,shou4577,,,"In mathematics?<p>Primary sources are way above the level of most college mathematics students, much less high school or younger students. Almost anything written in the last 50 years requires very advanced mathematical ideas, while anything written before that uses outdated notation which is very difficult to understand. Moreover, the primary sources for common ideas are often spread out over huge periods of refinements - going from a small idea to a general notion over the course of years, perhaps involving dozens of papers by multiple authors. One notable exception to this: Euler's papers. These might be readable by some students, yet when I see them presented in college courses, they are often presented by a secondary source for clarification.<p>The other thing I don't agree with is your use of the word ""interpret."" I don't think that it is common to find a mathematician who believes that mathematics is open to interpretation.<p>Lastly, original research in mathematics is hard. It's not the interpretation of previous ideas (although it is occasionally relating concepts previously thought to be unrelated - some consider this the most important type of mathematical result, but it is much harder to do than you might think), but the formulation of new ideas. Even to know if an idea is new requires a great deal of mathematical training.<p>Perhaps I'm wrong about this, but I think that for young mathematics students your ideas are unfeasible. Remember that the original sources for a lot of basic mathematics are hundreds of years old. Even Euler's famous writings on geometry (the exception that I said might be workable) were largely a rewriting of previous ideas into a coherent whole - basically a textbook - and could not really be considered an original source.<p>Edit: my apologies, I misunderstood. I did not realize that we were talking about teaching history, in which case I defer to someone of greater experience.",1301567624

So I feel like it's very unlikely.<p>Google can effectively keep them half-a-version behind, though by giving an access to a next Android version to a limited group of ""blessed"" manufacturers but they still have to release at least the GPL-covered portions of source code when those new devices become available for consumers. This is usually some low-level stuff (changes to Linux kernel and maybe  some device-integration code), so Amazon & co. don't have to maintain their own stack of device APIs which is a big win for them.

Archimedes's proof of the surface area and volume of a sphere is far more insightful and explanatory than the standard calculational proof using integration that any unthinking freshman can crank through with ease. As a rule, calculation proceeds by reducing a big problem into a sequence of small, easily dispatched problems, but human understanding usually works the opposite way. So, it's not that calculus cannot be taught in a way that highlights human understanding, but the greatest strength of calculus is that it produces answers whether you understand what you are doing or not.",1301566834

It still has some limitations like the proxy module only supports http 1.0 and some of the chunked encoding stuff is partial at this point, but it is generally sufficient.<p>Luajit is really fast and nice to use (the ffi interface can call C directly) and coroutines mean that blocking calls can just drop back to the event loop. You have to write anything blocking as an nginx module though, hence this collection of modules as a bundle.<p>Having a real programming language in the context of a web server is nice, you can either do small things like write complex auth that you might otherwise have a proxy for, or you can write full content handlers.<p>Agentzh is pretty helpful on the nginx list with issues too.",1301566462

We should encourage creative thinking, novel solutions, and ways of approaching problems.<p>This is, actually, all true.

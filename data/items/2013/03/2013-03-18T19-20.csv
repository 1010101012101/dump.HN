5396746,comment,5392024,5396302,1,0,pron,,,"> I'd like to point out, respectfully, that appeal to nature, or to evolutionary ""purpose,"" is (especially vis. ethics) an argumentative fallacy<p>Absolutely, but I've made no appeal to nature. The only part which may be confused as an appeal to nature is when I said that this issue is unlike slavery in that meat has played a crucial role in forming us. This is not to say that the moral question should be avoided, only that it's complicated. Calling human desire for meat ""a taste"" is like calling our desire for art or stories ""a taste"". Neither meat nor art is crucial to our survival, but they are both an important part of what has made us human.<p>You could say that, unlike art, eating meat causes suffering, to which I'd answer that our existence causes suffering. The crux of my argument is this: no matter what we do, as long as we live on this planet we will be killing animals, lots of them, and in very cruel ways. We might do it directly or indirectly, but there is no way to avoid it. When we approach the moral question this is something we must bear in mind. We might decide that it's better to grow tomatoes and slowly starve animals to death rather than slaughter them. But we cannot avoid killing them.<p>If your goal is to minimize suffering, then I'd say we should go back to being hunters-gatherers. But we can't, because technological progress is also an integral part of who we are. So we choose progress and death to animals. Now the question remains whether within these confines we should minimize animal suffering caused directly by humans wearing blood-stained clothes. Maybe. As I've said in the beginning of my original comment, human values change.",1363636720
5396745,comment,5396630,5396630,1,0,tgflynn,,,"I don't know much about check processing but I used to work for the company that built the system the USPS uses to read addresses on envelopes (both machine printed and hand-written).  Many years of research and development went into that system financed either directly by USPS funding to academia or through performance improvement contracts with industry.  Over 10-20 years the systems went from being able to read only a fraction of the mail to the point where today they have practically replaced manual address keying.<p>There is probably a similar story behind check reading systems.<p>My impression is that although there are a number of commercially available OCR applications their performance is far from that of specialized proprietary systems such as those used by the USPS and banks.",1363636712

5396712,comment,5396384,5396384,6,0,pan69,,,"I have been using an extra step what I'd to call ""Interactive wire frames"". The entire process goes something like this:<p>1) Write down in a few paragraphs the objective of your project. what it is you want to do and what this project needs to achieve. If you work for a client, discuss this text with your client until you're both happy about it. It's this text that's going to define the scope of your project.<p>2) Set up a requirements and scope document. This document will describes in greater detail what you discussed in the document at step 1 and it's this document that will become your official Scope of Work document. If you have a client, discuss this document with your client and get sign off.<p>3) Based on the requirements and scope I create wire frames using Balsamiq. If you have a client then discuss the wire frames with your client and get  sign of before moving on.<p>4) Based on the wire frames I now create ""Interactive wire frames"" using Bootstrap. I basically recreate the Balsamiq wire frames in Bootstrap. This allows you and your client to click through it. The difference between a paper wire frame and an interactive one is that the interactive wire frame will bring out issues early on. Again, if you have a client get sign off.<p>5) Build. Uh? That's right. At this point I build as much of the core functionality as possible and I use the interactive wire frames for the front end of it. This allows me to fine tune the functionality and to test if all the objectives are met. Discuss with your client whenever you have something significant to demonstrate.<p>6) Design. Often design can be started during step 5. Very important here, discuss the designs with your client (if you have one) and get sign off.<p>7) Implement designs and cross browser test. Again, with a client, get sign off.",1363636380

As someone who doesn't sign these kinds of contracts and hasn't for years, I'm not sure what the exact position of the carrier is without downloading and analyzing a phone contract, which I don't feel like doing right now.<p>The differences from leasing a car are for obvious reasons. If you don't make the payments on a car, a repo guy comes along and takes your car away. Bit difficult to do that on a phone, so they hit you with an early termination fee instead and you agree to it as part of the contract terms.<p><i>Don't fall into the trap of thinking that the free market is relevant here. It is not a free market when some players get special privileges and protections not available to other players. Cell phone companies get lots of special privileges, and this is just one more to add to that list.</i><p>I didn't mention the free market, but since you bring it up, the players within the phone industry have similar privileges. Saying that they get different privileges from, say, auto retailers is pointless, because they're not int he same market. Although I'm no fan of the major cell companies, I could point out that they also bear the burden of paying billions up front for lease of spectrum, whereas manufacturers of cars just have to get the thing running and into the hands of the would-be driver, who then pays over time for road use through taxes on fuel etc.<p>You want to unlock the phone overseas, then do it overseas where you won't be subject to US law. You want to have two contracts on the same phone, the second one is going to be month-to-month by definition because the second carrier has no property interest in the phone. you can easily get out of your contract by paying the ETF.<p>As I said elsewhere, I don't like these contractual provisions either, which is why I don't enter into such contracts. I <i>do</i> own my own phone, because I paid for it.

As I am stripping out features, I am reducing initial cost to the customer.<p>I'm having difficulty on setting the initial price though. Go to low and I reduce its profitability. Go to high and I might not know if its viable or just priced too high. I'm struggling to find a medium ground I suppose.

There have been significant steps taken by the Supreme Court to limit and restrict the prosecution of minors because of fundamental research into neurological development and youths' ability to make proper judgements.<p>What those guys did was reprehensible and they should be in jail. No questions asked.<p>But we have two separate penal systems in this country: one for juveniles and one for adults. The adult penal system uses harsher punishments than the juvenile one.<p>You simply cannot compare the sentence handed down in both of these cases, because they are happening under two effectively different penal systems.<p>For ANOTHER thing, the actual sentences handed down by the judge in the Steubenville rape trial where that they are remanded to the state juvenile detention facility for at least one year (for the one who only participated in the rape) and for at least two years (for the one who also sent around the pictures). At most, they will stay in such a facility until they are 21. In addition, these two must also register as sex offenders for the rest of their lives, effectively giving them life-long parole.<p>So, when we are talking about Aaron Swartz, everyone quotes the maximum penalty he could have faced, even though it was almost impossible he ever would have received such a sentence. But in the case of these two rapists, everyone is saying they only got one or two years. The fact is, when you want to say punishment is potentially harsh, you quote the maximum, but when you want to say it is weak, you quote the minimum. Make up your mind.<p>Again, I'm not trying to defend those two guys. I'm making the point that you cannot compare juvenile and adult sentences. Perhaps question whether or not these two should have been tried as adults, sure, but then there are many who would argue that that is overly aggressive prosecutorial action[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_Six"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_Six</a>",1363633444

It sounds like I paid the carrier's price, signed a contract, and then owned the phone (while being locked into a contract).<p>There is more to this than just the carrier's contract.  Let's say I travel to another country, and I want to pay for a phone plan there so that I do not have to pay roaming charges.  I'll need to unlock my phone to do that...and now by law I cannot (at least not here in America).  For that matter, suppose I am <i>here in America</i> and I want to have two contracts with two different carriers on the same phone...once again, the law stops me.  This is, plain and simple, a law that protects the carriers' business model in ways that other businesses are not protected.<p>Don't fall into the trap of thinking that the free market is relevant here.

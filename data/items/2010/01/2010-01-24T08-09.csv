There are plenty of good, easy algorithms to solve this, much faster than waiting a day for slime to grow.<p>Confused as to how this got in Science & Wired.

I wasn't interested in a big splash, but I was really interested in getting a couple of beta users that could give me some good feedback, and that's what I got.  It's a good crowd to get some feedback on what's broken and what works.<p>Since then, I've posted a few more links here in the comments, and prakash posted a link in one of his comments on a thread regarding economic social news sites (thanks).  I've also posted a link asking for beta users on Craigslist San Jose, and I've posted a couple links in economic blog comments where appropriate.<p>Traffic stats so far for 2 1/2 months:   1200 uniques, and close to 5000 page views.<p>My future marketing plans include buying some more beta users off of Mechanical Turk at $0.05 a pop, and using a $100 credit I have with Adsense.  I have a hunch, I'm going to get a lot better traffic with Mechanical Turk than Adsense.<p>re: funding<p>The scuttle butt in the Valley is that funding is slowly starting to flow again, but it's still pretty hard to come by unless you have traction.  Traction == customers signing up and loving your product and possibly revenue.<p>I'd focus on making your users really really happy, and slowly build up a customer base from that rather than go for a big splash and hope that things take off.",1264322437

My professors apparently wrote some excellent letters of recommendation for me.<p>I thought I'd mention that since the article (and others) mentions that it's harder to get in with a low GPA these days.  This may be true, but it is still possible.<p>Your professors should know you after you finish taking classes with them.  Preferably you should also be doing research with one (or hell, more) of them.  Showing a professor your research potential is the quickest way to change your letter from ""smart but lazy"" to ""smart and hardworking, but stubbornly doesn't care about the mundane class stuff that none of us really think is that important for research anyways.""<p>As an aside: If you're interested in doing graduate work in security, please contact me.  (My e-mail is listed in my profile.)  We're always looking for good researchers and if you're good, we'd be interested in your application and it's possible I can poke someone on the admissions committee to make sure your app gets looked at thoroughly.<p>Also: Apply broadly.  I had success at a few programs, some ranked higher than the one I'm in.  I'm where I am because I followed funding and I wanted to be near the Bay Area.",1264320222

This may appeal to those in charge of funding (who you mention are absent anyway) by shifting dollars around. More diligent clients would see this is not necessarily an attractive alternative and opt for your more traditional pricing model.",1211966945

The traits that make a city unique are the result of the actions of a minority of its inhabitants.<p>If your ""logic"" were accurate, Los Angeles would be no different than Tijuana, for example, considering that most of the ""normal"" people there are lower class Mexican immigrants.<p>Allow me to inform you of something essential about PG's essays: they require intelligence to truly understand, to the point that his core arguments will simply sail over the heads of those who lack it.\nEvidence of not having the required intelligence includes attempting to refute the core arguments with a myriad of minor points that appear to point out logical flaws, when they only manage to address comparatively minor items of negligible consequence.<p>Mr. Graham's essays are valuable owing to their QUALITATIVE aspects, not to their total QUANTITATIVE sum . . .",1211966388

In the long run, it created a lot of problems to support those customers (at a very low margin or at a loss), just to maintain the reputation of ""not leaving the customers cold"" in the marketplace.<p>Letting this deal go, might also send a strong message to X, Y, Z potential customers, that you are offering much more than the cheapest solution and are willing to walk away.",1211965408

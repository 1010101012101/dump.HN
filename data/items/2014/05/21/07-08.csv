(Also because municipal workers in some states can switch jobs to a nearby city and get a second pension, that can jump to $4 million per person.)<p>In the San Francisco bay area we have this nearby example:<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703625304575115551578762006"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405274870362530...</a>\n&quot;The study also found that lavish pay and benefit packages were a root cause of the city&#x27;s problems. In Vallejo compensation packages for police captains top $300,000 a year and average $171,000 a year for firefighters. Regular public employees in the city can retire at age 55 with 81% of their final year&#x27;s pay guaranteed. Police and fire officials can retire at age 50 with a pension that pays them 90% of their final year&#x27;s salary every year for life and the lives of their spouses.&quot;<p>And another example in California, where residents may be required to pay more in taxes (it&#x27;s already the highest-taxed state) because of political mismanagement and ballooning pension benefits:<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304815004579419371878171830"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230481500...</a>\n&quot;Yet government pension costs are soaring as the bills that politicians postponed during the hard economic times come due. No less than Warren Buffett warned this week that &quot;local and state financial problems are accelerating, in large part because public entities promised pensions they couldn&#x27;t afford.&quot; .. Calpers also voted last month to dun state taxpayers for an additional $1.2 billion a year. And lo, the state Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office says that California State Teachers&#x27; Retirement System (Calstrs) says it needs $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion more annually by 2020 to pay down its $71 billion shortfall.

As for &quot;making things up as I went along&quot;, it&#x27;s not a phrase I would use. Besides, I value creativity in the highest esteem. About &quot;didn&#x27;t know anything about FRP when I made Elm&quot;, I did think you&#x27;d had your key ideas on your own, and retrospectively related them to the FRP literature. Now I understand that the FRP influence was more substantive than I knew.<p>I&#x27;ve posted a correction on that ReactiveCocoa page (<a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/pull/1344#issuecomment-43716637"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/pull/1344#iss...</a>): &quot;Correction. I misinterpreted some recent remarks by Evan Czaplicki (@evancz) about the origin of Elm. While his initial idea was independent (to his credit), the design of Elm itself was indeed influenced by the FRP literature. I&#x27;m glad you kept the Elm references. I&#x27;ll apologize to Evan.&quot; I also posted (terser) correction to a reply I made on Twitter (<a href=""https://twitter.com/conal/status/469005649645281280"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/conal/status/469005649645281280</a>): &quot;I mistook @czaplic&#x27;s remarks on #elmlang origin. Independent inspiration; design quite influenced by FRP lit. Sincere apologies, Evan! :(&quot;. If I see my misinformation spreading, I&#x27;ll do my best to correct it.<p>Again, my sincere apologies, Evan! Regards, - Conal",1400656358

What I want out of a laptop is a great form factor, solid battery life, a good keyboard, a large trackpad, a web browser and a real terminal.  I own a 13-inch MacBook Air, it cost $1000 brand new, so no I didn&#x27;t pay any premium for what I got.  If you disagree please link equivalent specced hardware with a fully aluminum unibody case, high quality backlit keyboard, large trackpad with multitouch that has equivalent weight, screen size, and battery life.  It does not break more often than it should, in fact it has never broken at all.  The screen is not overly shiny and it fits my code just fine.

Because that offends your sensibilities about work? Because you feel that people should work until they&#x27;re 65~70 to retire, if they ever manage to? Right now a number of school teachers are working until their late 60s to make a pittance upon retirement, trading down from houses to mobile homes to even make their retirement manageable. Do you feel these people aren&#x27;t as worthy as others making obscene amounts of money as they essentially raise the nation&#x27;s children for them?<p>Your entire supposition either buys into the myth that there isn&#x27;t enough to go around or worse, that you simply believe because we treat the majority of our labor pool like shit that anyone daring not to is in the wrong.",1400656266

7777023,comment,7776721,7776721,3,0,breakend,,,"Having been raised in a single parent home with a government employed mother, I know first hand that it is extremely difficult to raise a family on a government salary. Like another commenter said, these plans also are paid for from the government paycheck in part by the workers, reducing their current salary. Often, these government workers are also raising families and putting their kids through school. Without such a pension plan, this would not be possible and many (especially single parent) families of government working households would be stuck to a threshold close to the poverty line. The reality is that just because over the course of 30-some-odd years of hard work they accumulate enough pension to live a middle-class life style, does not make them millionaires, especially when you take into account healthcare deductions, the cost of living, their childrens&#x27; education, and any mortgage/car payments. The least we can do is support the people that protect, educate, and serve our communities. It is not necessary to bring light to their supposedly vast troves of wealth (sarcasm) when there are plenty of millionaires and billionaires who acquire their wealth through questionable means.<p>(Also I don&#x27;t approve of the fact that comments on the article itself are disabled, sidenote.)",1400656096

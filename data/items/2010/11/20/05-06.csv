1923943,comment,1923402,1923741,0,0,ugh,,,"Isn’t wearable computing all about being able to carry around a capable computer with you at all times without even noticing?<p>An Android phone or an iPhone certainly fit that bill. Those are not really wearable or they are at least not what you would have imagined ten or twenty years ago when thinking about wearable computing but they are just as useful. I would even argue that they are more useful. You get all the benefits without the downsides. We could have made all those gadgets much more durable and waterproof and we could have even mated them with clothing – that doesn’t seem technologically infeasible – but why should we? A small lightweight slab of glass we can just slip in our pocket seems much more practical.<p>As for watches, I'm not sure what’s going to happen to them. I know many people who just ditched their watch altogether because all their gadgets have clocks, but the wrist is certainly attractive real estate for technology or fashion or both. The problem is size, I think. There is no space for a 3.5"" or larger touchscreen on the wrist, even the 1.5"" screen of the nano is a stretch. That 1.5"" screen doesn’t allow for rich interaction, it can at most be used for very basic things (like in the case of the nano) or as a conveniently located remote for a larger interaction surface somewhere else.<p>I think, however, that it’s very questionable whether a setup with a watch as a remote is very convenient or practical. Why would you want to take care of two gadgets (charge them, be careful so that they don’t break and so on) when you can just pull your smartphone out of the pocket with about the same ease as looking at your watch?",1290231288

That's about the best you can do.<p>I'm reminded of a classic Joel post ""Controlling your environment makes you happy"" [1] (which, in my opinion, is one of the most important things ever written on UI/UX), particularly the section on ""Choices"" [2]:<p><i>""But wait!"" you say. ""It's important to have options for advanced users who want to tweak their environments!"" In reality, it's not as important as you think ... Every time you provide an option, you're asking the user to make a decision.</i><p>Lots of comparisons are made between iOS and Android. It's important to understand that they're fundamentally different. iOS is a <i>brand</i>. Android is a <i>commodity</i>, arguably even a <i>philosophy</i>. Give someone who has used an iDevice any other iDevice and they know what to do. Give someone who has a Samsung Galaxy S an HTC Evo and they'll likely be somewhat lost.<p>I would go so far as to say as people buying an iPhone are buying an iPhone; people buying an Android phone are buying a <i>phone</i> (or, in some cases, they're <i>not</i> buying an iPhone).<p>Anyway, the fragmentation problem with Android isn't really about the UI. It's about the hardware. I've heard from multiple sources that OpenGL is just a nightmare on Android because of allt he different GPUs. Some have different strengths and weaknesses to others and different idiosyncrasies.<p>My personal belief is that Android handset manufacturers are participating in seppuku. Their interests are different to those of Google. Android handset makers (and carriers!) want to differentiate themselves somehow. That's a big part of your fragmentation problem right there. They don't want to be interchangeable (and, in the carrier's case, just dumb pipes).<p>Google wants to commoditize the mobile platform. And they're succeeding. But with ever-cheapning hardware costs, all the handset makers are doing is racing each other to the bottom.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057....</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059....</a>",1290230524

The answered O(n+m) solution actually contains flaws beyond its lack of cleverness.\n1) there's no good reason to use a hash map, hashing is useful in maps for mapping an unevenly distributed set from a large an arbitrarily large space to an evenly distributed set from an arbitrarily small space. The space is only 26 characters so why hash? You can simply use a map (no hash needed), and in this case there's even a very natural way to get indices into an array (index(c) = c - 'a').<p>Now it's true, that these are both linear time solutions simply with different factors and we might simply say who cares. The thing about the prime solution is that it's actually really dumb itself and I think that's what Guy really wanted you to tell him. He was pointing out that you could leverage the smallness of your data and hoping the interviewee would come up with an even better way to leverage this fact.<p>The first thing we should notice is that asymptotic bounds are misplaced here if you consider how such a function might actually be used. The strings are basically being used as sets that is AA might as well be A as far as our answer is concerned. So assuming people aren't giving us stupid data (and in an interview you could mention a way to make this assumption true). The strings shouldn't ever have duplicates and thus shouldn't ever be bigger than 26 characters (otherwise they contain all of the characters and the answer is independent). So if a solution has runtime n + m + c, that c actually starts to matter.<p>The thing about the primes solution is that multiplication and modulo operations are actually very expensive and all you want to keep track of is whether you've seen a character (1 bit of information) so you should really use a bitmap for this. And since it so happens that 26 < 32 these will fit very nicely in a single int. It's even a pretty nice implementation: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/707639"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/707639</a><p>[edit: link to code]",1290229627

I was just about to submit this as an Offer HN, when I saw your submission.<p>Just wanted to add that MindTribe is a product development firm specializing in products that integrate hardware, software, and mechanical engineering (though not all of our programs feature all three). We're opening up <i>free</i> office hours to give entrepreneurs and startups 1-on-1 advice for getting their products from concept to market. There's no catch and no strings. We love talking about product development and we've been doing this informally for years. We're finally able to support this on a regular basis so we can more formally offer the service publicly.",1290229507

The task is 'detect presence in the set', and integers are uniquely identified by their prime factorization.  Powers of two would just give you another power of two.  That wouldn't actually preserve the information you're looking for.<p>Consider an original string 'bb', and a test string 'c'.<p>With powers of two, you'd have 2*2, and your test would be a division by 4, which would be successful by having no remainder, indicating that 'c' is a subset of 'bb'.",1290229477

1923899,comment,1920931,1920931,0,0,judegomila,,,"From Prof. Malcolm Smith<p>""I have always thought that the memristor is rather a weak concept.  It is defined as a device with a nonlinear relationship between flux and charge.  A linear memristor is the same as a resistor, so in linear circuits the element is not meaningful.  The definition does not pin down the type of nonlinearity.  So the difference between a variable resistor and a memristor is not sharply defined.  The mechanical equivalent of a variable resistor is of course a variable damper.  Variable dampers and semi-active dampers are of course used a lot in suspension systems""",1290229329

Has anyone else noticed that managers and teachers seem to be even more careless with details than their workers and students?  Of course, the causality could go the other direction, per Dilbert's Law - they could have been made managers because they were to incompetent (careless) to actually do the work.  Or could have become teachers because they realized they were too incompetent to do productive work.",1290229228

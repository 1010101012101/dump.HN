Not only is the company interviewing you to assess your technical skills and cultural fit, but you are interviewing the company as well to see whether you'd like to work there.<p>If you're a ""superstar"" (I don't really like that term), you want to work with other talented individuals.

On Windows I have to jump through hoops.<p>> Exe4J / Install4J; works everywhere<p>So to run a jar that produces command line output and is consumed by the script and is one line to run on Linux/Mac (java -blah -blah -jar foo.jar blah blah) requires me to purchase a 3rd party wrapper/installer app.  That there is a hoop to jump.  Finding the java binary via the registry worked just fine, didn't require installation or wrapping or anything else.<p>> Don't. Use the registry on Windows, dotfiles on Linux (and plists on Mac? Or is that gone with OsX) ?<p>I used the Python configfile module which does ini style files.  At the moment I save exactly one value.  It is trivial and works really well.  Doing more than that is more hoop jumping.<p>> Don't, use CHM on Windows (although I think this changed AGAIN recently).<p>So I need to convert perfectly good documentation that works in any browser on any platform into another format just because Windows strips the anchor when opening a URL?  More hoops.<p>Incidentally I do actually generate CHM files for one of my open source projects.  I had to give up because the help compiler refuses to install now (I believe the setup program is doing 32 bit arithmetic on free disk space and wrapping around to negative numbers).<p>> VMWare Workstation<p>I've yet to use any virtualization solution where guest disk access is at the same performance level as on the host.  (I prefer virtualbox.)<p>> If you get into x-platform dev without thinking too hard about it<p>I never said I wasn't a x-platform dev.  All my open source projects for well over a decade work on all 3 platforms.  But that is because I'm diligent and don't want there to be any impediments to others being able to use the software.  Windows is usually what causes the highest amount of work for least results, although there are exceptions (eg printing support has always been easiest to add support for on Windows).<p>But when we do our internal stuff there is no value to being cross platform to Windows.  It wouldn't be a big deal if it didn't require so much additional effort.  Consider something as trivial as deleting a file.  If you just had it open (can't delete open files on Windows, more hoops) then closing it and deleting will often fail.  You have to add delay/retry loops because tagalongs like virus scanners and backup agents opened the file after you closed it.<p>So as a result the only thing we have that runs on all platforms is one script because it is run by outsiders, and that required extra effort for Windows.  It could require even more if I did everything ""properly"" although the people running the script wouldn't know any different which is why I didn't expend even more effort.",1361480255

5260289,comment,5257270,5258795,1,0,oleganza,,,"Human psychology, to my understanding, is flexible. If you have patent threat for 100 years, people adapt to it. You have to accept existence of patents because someone may buy one and shut you down. You also surrounded by massive propaganda that whatever government does is generally good (bad stuff is exceptional). As a result, if not you, but many people around you see patents as a morally correct tool that can be abused, but if not abused, it's all right. And even if you don't think it's such a great idea, you still have to play along because someone else will use patents against you. Is it surprising then, that in 2013 (223 years since the first patent issued in 1790) you have big budgets to file as many patents as they can? Is that a proof that you would have similar situation with no patent office?<p>I admit, it is useless to debate too much about what would happen if. It's more pragmatic to talk about how would you design non-violent scheme of negotiation where people are protected and insured against violence.<p>The gun issue is not offtopic. It is the primary reason why you have all of the drama around government. Because people are ultimately threatened with murder if they do not comply. If you have no possibility to hurt person for non-complience, then there is no drama. You both can perfectly avoid each other and use peaceful means to find justice as much as you want.<p>So my approach to any question about abuse of (or use of) state-provided violence is this:<p>1. Identify the violence.
2. Think how to avoid it completely.<p>Patent law is a system of brutal violence not based on any hard core moral proof. You require proofs from a mathematician, and still do not kill him if he's wrong. Why don't you require even stronger proof from anybody with a gun? It is not a solution to limit patents. And not even to call for their abolishment. You cannot come to mafia and ask them to stop doing what they are doing. The solution is to simply avoid patents as much as you can while finding other ways to protect yourself.<p>How to do that practically (not by persuasion, but by building some sort of mechanism for people) - is another complex topic. I myself investigate how you can build an anonymous dispute resolution network on top of Bitcoin blockchain (to use it as a secure storage of agreements). Anonymity will provide safety from violence, while conforming to the network rules will allow to make deals with other people. This way you can grow a community of people who respect each other's choices without threatening each other using legal or illegal methods.",1361479929

If there's a problem with this simple thought experiment then a statement from it could be quoted and shown what's wrong with it. Instead you see only obfuscation and baseless allegations of wrongness. I see no solution there as I write this.<p>> The fact that the particles are getting closer with respect to distance relative to Frame X does not mean that they are getting closer together with respect to the coordinate r; in fact they are not.<p>This is false. Frame X is equivalent to an inertial frame says the principle of equivalence. Nothing about an inertial frame prevents one of the higher-velocity particles from passing by one of the lower-velocity (escaping) particles, like cars passing each other on the highway, which could happen in as little as a nanosecond as measured in X. In that case the r-coordinate of the higher velocity particle would not only have gotten closer to the r-coordinate of the escaping particle, it would have now the higher r-coordinate of the two particles, have passed outward through the horizon and be escaping itself.<p>> The particle inside the horizon has an r coordinate that decreases with time, while the one outside the horizon has an r coordinate that increases with time (here ""time"" is time with respect to Frame X).<p>R-coordinates aren't limited to discussion of black holes of course. Your head has an r-coordinate, as do your feet. Assuming your feet are lower initially, if the r-coordinate of your feet is decreasing while the r-coordinate of your head is increasing, you are stretching and your feet are not getting closer to your head in <i>any</i> inertial frame. Conversely if the r-coordinate of your feet is increasing faster than the r-coordinate of your head increases, your feet are getting closer to your head in <i>every</i> inertial frame that contains you. Eventually your feet will pass by and be higher than your head; you will have flipped upside down.<p>I think we've exceeded the limits of HN discussion.

Furthermore, all the VSTs are not that conceptually different. Like yeah Massive and Sylenth1 are different but they still have an oscillator, envelope, LFO, filter and effects. And if you understand how synthesis works and know one well picking up the other is not that hard compared with say if you know how to play piano and want to learn to play the guitar.<p>For me, not having frequencies overlap falls under mastering which I consider to be kind of separate but related issue. If you wanted to be in a traditional (as in, a band with 'real' instruments), you'd still have to learn that to make your music sound good in addition to learning the instrument. And I still think that learning Ableton (+VSTs) is easier than learning to play a 'real' instrument. Minus maybe the bass guitar :-). It's definitely more fun which is why I might think that it's easier.

Thats their game.  But what happens when you have to play the game with the hospital alone (if you dont have insurance, or if your insurance doesnt cover that stay for some reason). Then youre on the hook for the ENTIRE amount. Most hospitals have a policy that allows people to negotiate for a lower amount, but most people dont know this.  And dont expect the hospital to tell you about it, let alone help out.  So even if you can remember to negotiate while youre convalescing from a long hospital stay, good luck trying to get the deal the insurance company gets.<p>For the average person, this is no small matter. In the first case, a two day hospitalization that the insurance company got for $2,100 (after the insurance adjustment), would cost an uninsured person over $21,000. The adjusted charge ($2,100) would be a pretty nasty kick in the finances for most families, but they could bounce back.

Steinmetz, who stands among the electric industry's greats, was brought to GE's facilities in Schenectady, New York. GE had encountered a performance problem with one of their huge electrical generators and had been absolutely unable to correct it. Steinmetz, a genius in his understanding of electromagnetic phenomena, was brought in as a consultant -- not a very common occurrence in those days, as it would be now.<p>Steinmetz also found the problem difficult to diagnose, but for some days he closeted himself with the generator, its engineering drawings, paper and pencil. At the end of this period, he emerged, confident that he knew how to correct the problem.<p>After he departed, GE's engineers found a large ""X"" marked with chalk on the side of the generator casing. There also was a note instructing them to cut the casing open at that location and remove so many turns of wire from the stator. The generator would then function properly.
And indeed it did.<p>Steinmetz was asked what his fee would be. Having no idea in the world what was appropriate, he replied with the absolutely unheard of answer that his fee was $1000.<p>Stunned, the GE bureaucracy then required him to submit a formally itemized invoice.<p>They soon received it. It included two items:
1. Marking chalk ""X"" on side of generator: $1.
2. Knowing where to mark chalk ""X"": $999.<p><a href=""http://edisontechcenter.org/CharlesProteusSteinmetz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edisontechcenter.org/CharlesProteusSteinmetz.html</a>",1361478377

Electronic music and its technologies are there to simplify the process of creating and performing music. Yes, this eliminates the aesthetic of physical, dexterous skill and talent but it opens things up for creativity to be unleashed without the hurdle that is virtuosity.<p>Now this means that a lot of cliche garbage would inevitably  be created and shared which is expected. I see a lot of similarities between the modern day electronic music scene and the punk era of long ago. There was a ton of punk music produced between the 70s and 80s and it is still being pumped out today like nobodies business. The majority of which is cliche and quite awful. But every once and a while you get a gem. And I think those gems are worth the effort of weeding out the trite for the great.<p>The idea of skipping out on virtuosity and just letting creativity shine is an amazing concept. There have been a lot of fantastic punk bands without a shred of skill that have made break through productions. Beautiful music does not require dexterous fingers - though it is definitely something to be in awe of.<p>I am rambling. Essentially what I am trying to say is that virtuosity is good and all but I think there is the flip side which is a lack of virtuosity and modern technology gives every single person the ability to make incredible music regardless of that sort of talent. With enough time grinding on a modern DAW anyone can make music to rival the heavy weights of electronic music. That in itself is a huge revelation.",1361478018

standards and each situation is different.
What are the guidelines or standards that
you have seen after a PR depart at a company

If I called someone like you (business owner) and you didn't at least acknowledge my inquiry within a day -- perhaps asking for more time -- <i>and</i> it was a big scoop, I might not wait much longer. But if I had big news about a government agency or large multinational corporation with many layers, then some topics would merit more time for a response. There are a lot of variables though ... if the CEO of a large corporation got busted for drunk driving and killing someone, that's more time-sensitive than asking for comment about a long-term investigation into fraudulent practices at the company.

5259976,comment,5256894,5258568,5,0,mistercow,,,">For the very few, the answer is: when someone wants or offers to buy your company.<p>It seems that way from the perspective of having never received an offer, but my own experience makes me skeptical. I haven't been in that specific position, but I have had a possibly analogous experience.<p>For a few years, I developed and supported myself with a graphics-tablet targeted shareware drawing program (now sadly, due to changes in the Mac shareware ecosystem, one of my backburner projects). One of the ""big breaks"" I imagined might come my way would be if a tablet vendor wanted to bundle my software with their hardware.<p>And one day, toward the end, I got an offer for exactly such a deal. A small vendor wanted to include my program in a tablet bundle for a relatively small holiday run. They wanted to know what I would charge per-license. I did some research to find out what a typical OEM markdown would be and made them an offer based on what I found. It was a significant discount, but it was a fair price, and I'd have made reasonable money off of it. They responded saying that this was far too much and that they really couldn't go over $1 per license, which would have been more than a 95% markdown. I attempted to negotiate further with them, but they stopped responding to my emails shortly thereafter.<p>Should I have just taken them up on their initial offer? Well, as the cards finally fell, I would have probably made more money that way. And if I'd known that I would shortly be shifting my focus away from development of that program, I might have made a different choice. But whether or not I made the right choice given the information available to me is not the point. The point is that it wasn't an easy ""yes"".<p>When you aren't getting any offers, it seems like <i>any</i> offer would be a coup. But that's not how the market works. If your company is worth $5000, there's somebody out there who would be happy to pay you $200 for it. You won't <i>see</i> many offers like that because the number of businesses worth $5000 is large and the number of people who are willing to send out insulting offers is relatively small. But ""say yes to every offer"" isn't a winning strategy.",1361477436

The press release and memo to employees (imagine you are one of those trusting hardworking employees, or a local daily deals merchant they owe money to ""soon"") - over $300 Million worth actually, but have only $76 million - made it seem as if the company was doing so well financially that their happy investors who had invested at a $5.7 Billion valuation wanted to double down on their investments and bet even bigger.  NOTHING WAS FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.  The company was NOT doing fine, lost over $400 Million last year, was running low on cash, and had to take a massive valuation haircut and grant all sorts of special preferences in order to get this last lifeline of cash.<p>Their financials can't be papered over...and they verified to the penny as public Amazon.com owns 31% now of the company.  Look them up...if you know anything about finance or accounting you will reach the same conclusions as PrivCo did.

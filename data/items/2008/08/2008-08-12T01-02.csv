273587,comment,272776,273271,0,0,noonespecial,,,"RIM had to be huge before NTP bothered to shake them down form money. All of those examples above share the characteristics that they were huge successful companies when they were shaken down. The results were also fairly random.<p>I think it fits the model that once you are large and successful, the trolls will come out of the wood-work. The compliment is that you are big and successful enough to be worth a shakedown. Once you are the $250k to actually defend  (its really more like $1 mil/year for up to 7 years) is chump-change to you at that point. The big problem is the more or less random outcomes of such trials.<p>Until you are making big money, you are not worth the time because a victory would be costly to the victor and you'd have nothing to actually turn over. If they won debt, you'd just close up shop, as there'd be no point in working to pay a troll.<p>When I say that ""there's no such thing as infringement"" I'm not talking in the made-up world of legal types. They could rule you infringing for tying your shoe if they had the right lawyers, I'm speaking from the realistic standpoint that no two software systems are ever really alike unless you outright steal a copy of the source. I've used the example before that 2 computers that factor large prime numbers look form the outside like a pair of beige boxes that do exactly the same thing, but inside they are likely worlds different. This confuses the lawyers, patent officers and uneducated outsiders and leads to the problems that the patent system now faces when it comes to software.<p>When you patent a machine, you have to show its inner workings and they have to be novel. When you patent software, you can pretend that the general purpose computer is the inner workings, and not the actual software. This lets you cheat and patent a concept directly, without proof that the inner workings are novel or even possible.",1218505512

273583,comment,273518,273518,0,0,cperciva,,,"I have two piece of advice about what technical recruiters should not do, based on my own experience:<p>1. Announce that someone is applying for a job <i>without first asking them if they're interested</i>.  (Yes, this happened to me: I was invited to go somewhere and speak about my research; I agreed; and when I turned up, I was introduced as ""Colin Percival, who wants to work for us"".  To this day I still don't know exactly what job I was ""applying"" for -- I talked about my research and got out of there as quickly as I could.)<p>2. Announce that someone is applying for a job <i>other than the one they told you they were applying for</i>.  (In fact, there were three different positions involved, and in the end I was offered the position I originally applied for -- but not before having a list of on-site interviewers selected on the basis of a different position and then partially reworked on the spot.)",1218505283
273582,comment,273518,273520,0,0,raganwald,,,"The other dead giveaway is when you are working at an unusual hour. You hear a phone ring down the hall, no answer. Then a phone closer to you. Then one right next door, then your phone rings. The whole sequence is like something out of a cheap horror flick.<p>You eye it with disgust, but pick it up, and sure enough it's a recruiter sequentially dialling through the extensions. And they have the nerve to pretend they are calling just for you!",1218505179

273575,comment,273291,273291,0,0,nakajima,,,"The advantages described by the author here are the same ones you always hear in discussions about the benefits of unit testing (bugs are caught sooner, you feel better about your code, etc.)<p>The <i>real</i> benefit to unit testing (at least from my experience) is that it encourages you to write better code up front. By thinking in terms of the smallest possible units, you don't bite off more than you can chew. As a results, your code tends to be more decoupled, more modular, and more logical (unit testing helps you organize responsibilities in your code).<p>For this reason, even if I had to delete every test I wrote after I made it pass, I'd still write a failing test before writing any implementation code. Of course I'd much rather prefer to keep my test suite, since it does provide the benefits discussed by the author. While no amount of unit tests will reveal <i>every</i> bug in your code, the quality of code I've written after writing a failing test first is vastly superior to code I've written sans-test.<p>Your mileage may vary, but if you haven't tried it yet, I suggest you give it a whirl.",1218504285

The browser is decent, and every model has a GPS variant.<p>As for the platform, its fairly open. Its much more capable than the iPhone and regular cell phones, but not as open as Android (which is obviously about as open as you can get).",1218504067

273569,comment,273068,273327,0,0,neilc,,,"I think the reason this is a bad idea is that in order to turn a blocking operation into an async one, you're adding a totally new transport layer (HTTP) and data representation (JSON), as well as middleware. That means a significant performance hit, and a lot of needless complexity (and potential for failure).<p>It would be much simpler to either make the database driver itself non-blocking (Postgres' client library supports async queries, for instance), or use a dedicated pool of threads to perform blocking DB operations. It might be that Ruby's threading is too broken for the latter to be feasible, but it still makes using DBSlayer just to get async DB operations needless overkill.",1218503874

Fitting into the framework took some time, but its abstraction allowed us to move from mysql to posgresql for testing, and then back to mysql without much thought at all. Also, optimizing queries for a specific database is fairly simple.<p>Propel has been a bit of a kludge at times, but it does a decent job.

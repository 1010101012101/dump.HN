3323055,comment,3320768,3320927,1,0,acraciun,,,"Yes of course you cannot accomplish exactly the same things with Javascript as with Java for the simple fact that Javascript is imposed as (almost) the only scripting language understood by the browser. To use Java on the client side (not as an applet) you need a generator like GWT or our own Strongly-typed Javascript (<a href=""http://st-js.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://st-js.sourceforge.net</a> ). I agree that the line of code is maybe not the best way to measure the cost of development but it's a simple way to compare similar languages (given that all the other costs of the project are the same regardless the language). Using multiple complex external and internal libraries, refactoring the code to adapt to new business requirements, debugging in Javascript seems very time consuming to me. The help of an IDE these days is extremely important. A simple syntax highlighter (even with some auto-complete support) is far from being enough.  I'm still curious what IDE you used for your project and what was the cost, the size of a module where the requirements didn't change much. As a side question, how do you rename a method for example with the tool use (imagine that another method with the same name exists in a different class/module)?",1323248322

PayPal cares about making people who spend money really happy, and they succeed at that.  They have a huge captive audience with eBay, which <i>requires</i> the use of PayPal.  They have thus created a huge base of clients who want to spend money using PayPal, because they find it convenient, because in many cases because it doesn't require a credit card, and because the customers know that they can always complain to PayPal and PayPal will make them happy.<p>Thus, PayPal doesn't particularly care if merchants despise them, because the merchants have little choice; you can't easily convince people to use a new service, and on eBay you have no choice at all.  PayPal will quickly provide a refund to customers because PayPal want to keep customers happy, and because they know merchants will eat a refund now and then.  And PayPal doesn't particularly care about understanding merchants who don't ship physical objects to customers in boxes, because they don't want to think too hard about that case when it doesn't matter to most of their customers; they'd rather err on the side of ""you haven't shipped a product, so we'll issue a refund"".<p>No amount of bad PR among people like us, who actually care about merchant woes, will overcome the incredibly positive impression PayPal makes on people who spend money.",1323247176

I don't see Netflix, which is a tech company, being able to compete with the movie studios on the production side.<p>Either Netflix gives in to the movie studios' demands and enters licensing/pricing agreements on the studios' terms, or the movie studios will use a separate provider of streaming services and cut Netflix out entirely. The studios have been fighting web technology tooth and claw (usually in stupid ways), but the underlying motivation is that they want control of the price model. There is no technological reason why they won't be able to achieve this, even if their products will in the end be distributed through the web.<p>There are already startups working on portable and efficient streaming software which is specialized for licensing to content _producers_. If one of these companies can create a unified brand and payment portal while giving control to each individual studio, Netflix will be a second-class citizen in the media distribution world. I guess Netflix could take this role on its own, but it would go against its vested interests (ironically, exactly the same situation Blockbuster was in before it got crushed by Netflix).<p>There are probably some antitrust issues that will come into the light if this scenario plays out, which might mitigate things a bit.

To use the terminology of the page you linked to: education quite clearly qualifies as both rival (since it has non-zero per-student costs) and excludable (since each student participates in education individually), which makes it not a public good by the definition you linked to.",1323245332
3322988,comment,3322082,3322852,1,0,wheatBread,,,"Thank you :)<p>- It isn't open source right now. I think that's best while the language is still developing, but I plan on opening it up once things have settled down. I don't want to have legacy code before I've even started :P<p>- No, that aspect is fairly tangential. Since my language is heavily based on the lambda calculus, I already have pretty good basis for nice type properties. I don't have a formal semantics right now, so it will be a while before any such proof would even be possible.<p>- Both hopefully! I totally understand this dilemma. As lots of people here have pointed out, there is a lot of work to be done on the implementation, but the theoretical aspects of the language have to be a higher priority for the next couple months. It's stressful!<p>I wish you the best on your project! It sounds really ambitious / useful. I imagine such an analysis could help generate much faster code too.",1323245320

They fucked up on a couple tactical moves, but they know where the future is and are positioning themselves to be there.  Even the second stock offering makes sense in the long run: better to maintain market share and grow the market than to tighten the belt and focus on high-margin offerings at the cost of the platform, especially when competitors are making big investments.<p>Had I a few dollars to invest, Netflix at a 74% discount seems like a pretty sweet long-term deal.  If they pull it out I make out like a thief, and if the stock drops much lower they become a very tempting acquisition target for Amazon/Apple, or possibly even Google.",1323244858

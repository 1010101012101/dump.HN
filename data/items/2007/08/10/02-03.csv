But there's another easy way to build user loyalty and motivate your team. Invite users down to your office to come have their picture taken with the staff. Post the picture on your site. It only takes 5 minutes and it's worth a lot.",1186714610

Only inflate this number if you're about to do a dog and pony show for a VC, otherwise you will only have yourself to blame when you manage to achieve 1%.\n# The one number that's missing here which would help to provide a sense of scale is the actual user base of each app. It's almost like pulling a Michael Moore: the murder rate in the US is way higher than in Canada (they have 10x the population, but sssssh! Don't tell anyone or the numbers are less impressive!)\n# Remember that, along with a bigger user base comes a higher support cost. Look at RegOnline's support calls/day compared to even FeedBurner's. ",1186713527

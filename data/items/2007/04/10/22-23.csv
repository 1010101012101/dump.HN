11586,comment,11285,11584,0,0,danw,,,"There were too many reasons against me in my application. The idea is weak, poorly explained, no demo, etc. My cofounder also dropped out on me after we submitted the application so I would have had to disclose that I'm now a single founder which would have guaranteed rejection. Never mind, on to plan B.",1176244714

11581,comment,11551,11566,0,0,vlad,,,"If you honestly think PG rejected people based on their idea, I think you're wrong.  That's probably the last criteria he used.  So, work on the idea.  I would reject 90% of submissions, too, if I was running something like this.<p>For example, with Google, Google AdSense was the glue that made everything work (profitability, great product, many users, good reputation, ability to have free food.)  You might say their demo and pagerank was actually important, but they couldn't even sell that for $1 million dollars.  Heck, even right now, nobody would buy their original technology as Yahoo! and MSN must have already surpassed the original PageRank in quality.",1176244141

11579,comment,11577,11577,0,0,Stuzo,,,"So, I did not get an interview.  The purpose of me entering was to network and connect with possible team members for my current project.  I am a non technical founder who has gone at it with a team of hired individuals.  I am a business guy at heart and understand tech from a product and design standpoint better than most, but I canÂ’t write code.   I have invested over $100k of my own money into the project.  I am looking to bring on board two rockstar programmers as cofounders. <p>The site is www.stuzo.com.  We currently have close to 7,000 community members and the site has some revenues.  The site was originally launched as an intercampus textbook exchange that enabled college students to buy and sell online and then to meet on campus for the exchange.  The model and the site have gone through a complete overhaul over the past 6 months.   The new site just went live today.  We are tidying things up this week and will begin a grassroots on/offline marketing campaign next week.   My goal is to connect people through the media they own, love, and want.  There is still a lot of work that needs to be done to build out the vision.  <p>Check out the site and drop me a line if you like what you see. You can reach me via aim/gtalk/skype.  My name for all is stuzoguy.   \n",1176244070

11568,comment,11491,11491,0,0,vlad,,,"I heard that March is the best month to launch, and April through December are very bad.  I guess you will have to wait until March. :)<p>Actually, everybody always says a.s.a.p.  Most people think they're competing against ""people who will rip me off as soon as I release my product"" which leads to conclusions of ""if I release on day X, I will be ripped off Y number of days later, so I should wait until Z, the perfect time, to release.""  In fact, there's a higher chance that there are startups and current companies doing something similar REGARDLESS of YOU.<p>A lot of the reason existing companies have not caught on to idea X is because the whole reason you have idea Y is because the current companies just came out with idea X and there's simply no way to do Y before X.  So, they may have already had your idea Y in mind, or started working on it, but had to release X first.  So, when you got your idea, so did employees of all of these other companies, as well as budding entrepreneurs.  So, you should release and at least get credit for being first.  The whole point of being a startup is you can create whatever there's a huge chance big companies are working on as well, but much faster because you're just implementing basic features and avoiding bureacracy, as well as have no responsibilities.  So, if you're trying to do a startup PG-style, I would try to create it and release it as soon as it works, with the bare features in it, and get publicity about it.<p>I'm sure there are other mantras, like targeting a very small niche and improving the product, and only publicizing it when its ready (but you have tons of feedback from your small niche).  Or, maybe getting a lot of venture capital straight off and partnering with big shots after you're much older and have many contacts.  But I think if you're doing it PG-style (and I don't speak for him), you should release it as soon as it works.  More or less.",1176243397

11559,comment,11496,11496,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Bummer to get rejected - just not meant to be for us. Fortunately we are self-funded and bootstrapping it. YCombinator is really the only funding we would consider, since it would be much more than just the small funding. <p>The one relief I have is not having to think so much about an exit. That was my main concern with taking investment. I really don't have much interest in thinking about exit strategies. We're much more focused on building a profitable private company like 37Signals or SmugMug. That may change someday, but for now that's our sole focus.<p>Even for those they don't fund, YCombinator puts out a TON of value for early startups: Paul's essays, Jessica's book, Startup News, Startup School, etc. That generates huge good-will for them and is a great example for other seed-funders and VC's to follow.<p>Thanks YC and thanks to all the contributors here ;)",1176242614

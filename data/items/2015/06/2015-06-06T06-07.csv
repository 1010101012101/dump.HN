Many people seem to find it valuable beyond bookmarks, but I don&#x27;t really get it.<p>What I <i>have</i> been able to glean is that it re-renders the pages you save to your pocket in a more &quot;readable&quot; way, and it looks more like a newspaper or magazine or Medium blog post. Less clutter, more focus on content, at least that&#x27;s the goal.<p>I have my doubts about this being valuable enough to make it a standard feature. I did whatever one has to do to opt-in when it showed up in the Developer version...I thought it was a new Mozilla thing, which I&#x27;m always willing to check out. I was disappointed, and surprised, that it was not a Mozilla thing. That wasn&#x27;t made clear, I don&#x27;t think, in the description of what I was opting into.<p>I feel a little misled by it, actually, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something I want to use going forward, but I&#x27;m not sure how to opt back out.

9669974,comment,9669125,9669426,0,0,redwards510,,,"Based on the Snowden files, it seems completely plausible that the US has the capability to determine the origin of the hack. Of course, we all know that having a Chinese IP is not proof of origin, but what about network flows? The NSA has sensors all over the world analyzing traffic. They even have a limited history they can query. What if they could determine the endpoint of the data and see that there was nothing connected to that endpoint at the same time, sending the same amount of traffic (using it as a proxy). You might think this would be extremely hard, since there is so much data on the net, but if they had some implants on some routers watching a particular hotspot, they could reasonably make the determination that the attack originated from fingers on a keyboard there.<p>And let&#x27;s talk about implants. The NSA has installed malware in China, we can agree on that, right? So if they can see that a known Chinese dumpsite has the stolen data, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that China was involved somehow. Maybe they have hard drive firmware that constantly scans drives for particular strings and when found, it calls home. Inside the stolen data files were some of those strings.<p>With all the money spent on the NSA&#x27;s infrastructure and the stakes involved in agitating a powerful nation, it stands to reason that they have made proper attribution a high priority. These guys aren&#x27;t just looking at source IPs in a pcap and calling it a day.",1433573334

I did not receive the same standard of emergency care, even though I had the money to pay.

This showed you pretty much the same data that a Java or C# GUI debugger does when you stop, albeit wrapped on a long line instead of one per line in a scrolling list.

In addition Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin realized the craft overshot its intended landing spot and was heading for a field of rocks and boulders where landing would be impossible.  What saved them is Neil taking manual control of the LEM, finding a smooth landing spot, and touching down the LEM with only seconds of fuel to spare.<p>Neil&#x27;s landing is in my mind just as amazing as the recovery of 13.  There was no way Neil could have really prepared for a manual landing in the low gravity of the moon.

The trip takes approximately 2 minutes and 45 seconds.<p>Extrapolate that to a ~100m depth for a wait of 8 minutes 15 seconds, with a ~200m horizontal span that needs to be excavated manually all the way to the surface - you probably need one to two city blocks of demolition for a 30deg escalator.<p>There are some high-speed elevators out there, at these heights we&#x27;re strongly limited by comfortable acceleration (at the highest peak speeds from Mitsubishi or Toshiba you&#x27;d be talking about upwards of ~15m/s, but you couldn&#x27;t safely reach those at this height).  1m/s^2 seems to be okay.  That puts a half a trip at 10 seconds, or 20 seconds from when the doors finish closing to when the doors begin opening.  Figure 25 seconds on either end for filling and emptying, and you have a 90 second round trip.  Expect something like 4 20-person elevators for typical stops, to maybe 16 for an inner-city transfer station, and you can move 50-200 people per minute.<p>According to Metro, a single escalator can move 90 people per minute;  They typically pack 2 escalators and a stairwell, or 3 escalators running 2-1 peak flow, into a shaft, but escalator availability ran as low as 60 percent for a number of decades before a recent improvement drive (now ~92%), so you had good odds that at least one was broken (or, in optimistic parlance, &#x27;had become stairs&#x27;).",1433570971

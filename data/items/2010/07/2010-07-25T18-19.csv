I'm not sure where you live, but absolutely everybody is hiring entry-level jobs here with minimal or no skills required.<p>Lifeguards and childcare-providers are paid $10-12 an hour, entry-level librarian positions are in the $10 range, upscale retail is $10-12, even food service jobs are $7-8.  I see ""help wanted"" signs everywhere I look.<p>As long as you don't have debt and live frugally, you can get a clean apt, eat 3 meals a day, have broadband internet, and stash a good chunk away for a rainy day with a job like that.  Cost of living is low here; that pay is far above the poverty level.<p>The problem is, a bunch of twentysomethings went in debt to to get a polysci degree under the mistaken assumption that it would automagically give them a better job.  They can still return to the job they did in highschool and be a perfectly functioning member of society.  They don't want to, because they think it's beneath them.",1280084255

I've personally always tried to make my diet as healthy and appealing as possible. Some of what I do:<p>For chips: bake chunks of potatoes in the oven with a lot of olive oil, some Tempeh and a bit of vinegar and salt.<p>Chocolate: get used to very dark chocolate, so dark it contains little sugar. This is actually very healthy. It is the sugar and any unhealthy oils, that makes a chocolate bar unhealthy.<p>Nachos: The beans in nachos are actually very healthy. Increasing your consumption of beans any way you can is good thing. Take a corn tortilla, heat it with olive oil, add lots of refried beans made with more olive oil, a <i>small</i> amount of real cheese, and <i>lot</i> of fresh salsa (fresh tomatoes, peppers, cilantro, etc). Quite healthy homemake nachos.<p>Sodas: I dilute fruit juice and add rose water, vanilla flavoring and vinegar or limon juice to a get soda-like taste that's not at all sweet (I think that even regular fruit juice is too sweet to be a soda substitute). Cafe Gratitude, among other health food restaurants, has some appealing sodas.<p>-- The oil in foods is often what can give one a feeling of satisfaction. ""Junks foods"" exploit this along with the ""sugar"" rush. But oil isn't necessarily bad at all. Rather, what's important is getting a good supply of good oil (especially olive) and avoiding really bad oil like transfat.<p>Jeanne Calment lived to the oldest documented age ever - ""She ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to <i>olive oil</i>, which she said she poured on all her food and rubbed onto her skin, as well as a diet of port wine, and ate nearly one kilo of <i>chocolate</i> every week.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment</a><p>I'm not sure about the port wine though.",1280083427

1546065,story,,,1,0,messel,"Ask HN: Have you met Emeri Gent?",,"A fairly regular commenter on my blog, has dropped serious philosophical flow comments on some of my simple posts. I really appreciate his stuff and thought some of you may as well. Many of his comments are far more interesting than my original posts. Here's one of his latest comments:<p>One of the reasons ""Viktor Ovurmind"" works for me is imagination and exploration. Today I added ""Rupy Yuan"" into that future mix of my personal explorations, because it is good to try things and see where they fall, but this would be anarchy if it was simply a random event. So our imagination has to find the poetic and whatever that poetic is how we learn to escape structure and yet at the same time find new structure in the escape.<p>Many major innovations occur when people have gone outside their field of expertise and therefore appreciated a different way of doing things. An example of that would be Toyota creating a part of its core philosophy from watching how supermarket is run. Then there is simply stuff which is just off left field such as Einstein imagining himself following a beam of light.<p>Where I come often unstuck is premature conclusion and in arriving at a conclusion, I have killed off any possibility for imagination and exploration to work on me. Sometimes ""that working on me"" can be a painful process and sometimes blind chance of serendipity. However it works is not for me to conclude but the moment I have arrived at a conclusion, I am working from that point onwards with dead ideas, or even ideas that might have found their way into my life simply through recency or exposure.<p>I look at music as a great example of a form of imagination that is based on a core of basic notes but which can proliferate into so many forms and different ways. That is why some people liken the move into the information space as the new punk rock or rock'n'roll of our time. It is then whatever way we put it together.<p>I think a reason why premature conclusion is more common rather than the birth of something new, is perhaps attributable to the way we preconceive what innovation should be. Indeed our society is obsessed with innovation to the point we probably kill the goose that lays the innovative golden egg. In my own pursuits I am apt to utilize different exposures to music as means of surrendering the logical and structures of reason, without expectation of a pay-off or a discovery. By not wanting something to happen, the opposite seems to occur.<p>Linkin Park is a good example of musical form which can stir my mind to take me away from the literate forms or any professional habit I have acquired that subjects me to a more fixed way of looking at things:<p>In Between
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMiUrjdOdYE<p>What I've Done
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzuo_UObpuA<p>Somewhere I Belong
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iCtpuQvydk<p>When I lay out this music in this way, I am simply appealing to the poetic within me. If there is nothing poetic within to resonate beyond regular behaviour, then I am wasting time and I should really apply to Walmart and live the rest of my days stocking shelves, but if there is an even a hint of the poetic to fuel exploration, then the output is pure imagination. When we try to forcefit someone else's formula or ideology or theory into something that we have not found within ourselves, then we are clones and imitators and there is no difference to this way of being than applying for a dead-end job.<p>Ultimately, the way we organize work, whether it applies due process such as agile or feature creep as described above, a new way of working is often just on the other side of the fence. One way of looking at work is how film is made. I am often left in wonder how a Hollywood film project costing millions of dollars can assemble a wide diversity of talent, find a common moment on their schedule, deliver a self-contained project and at the end of it, go off in their different merry ways.<p>Whether it is the infinite possibilities in music or the creative chaos of making a blockbuster movie, everything begins with imagination and exploration that is not simply a bus load of blog comments all tripping off a linear reaction of awareness. That is why my most stark suggestion is to ignore what it is I say but decide yourself what the fruits of your imagination will be.<p>That our thinking becomes relative is simply a courtesy, an etiquette and a respect which is an important dynamic of how we co-exist together, yet our imaginations are only limited to the extent we are able to handle the liquor of our own imagination and how we turn that fuel into a life worth living. If we cannot make that form of life for own given selves, we cannot do it for another - we can only give as much as we gain, and in imagination, it is how we approach this because it is central to our own DNA, rather than simply what it means or what its worth as an investment in drawing a premature conclusion.<p>One of the things I love about coming to Victus Spiritus is it provides a lot of white space that seeds my own imagination. I much prefer to observe my ""Emeri Gent"" emergent form of writing as akin to a Mission Impossible tape. Having thought this, hopefully these ideas will self-destruct, but the residue of that is an intelligence called my own learning and personal discovery. Imagination therefore isn't something one can program, it is merely something one can develop by learning how to be generous in its movement and application.<p>[Em]<p>The comment link: http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/07/22/great-software-is-measured-by-how-little-it-constrains-human-imagination/#comment-64100570<p>more of Emeri on disqus: http://www.disqus.com/emerigent/",1280083409

It turns out, many of the programs that leave you with marketable skills necessarily sacrifice breadth of understanding.<p>This isn't to say all cs grads know nothing of the world, but it was a noticeable problem.  There is, of course, virtue in training people to think only about a single field and think about it deeply and constantly.  But I didn't want to be one of those people, so I switched to Political Science.<p>Political Science, at my school, was an interdisciplinary program - it allowed students to design their own concentrations within the framework of the program.  Because of this, I was able to take advanced level courses in  philosophy, music theory, english, astrophysics, economics, and computer science.  No I'm not an expert on any of these, but I have the groundwork to understand any of them that I wish to personally pursue further.  And many of them, I have.<p>Of course, after five years of college, I finally realized that I'm most passionate about writing, advertising, and technology, but I'm stuck competing against people with more specifically tailored credentials.  This is obviously a problem, and I'm not going to claim I haven't spent nights wishing I had just stuck with something that would land me a job and a life of comfort.  But comfort is as dangerous as it is pleasant and a lack of it often spurs the greatest innovation.  That last part, however, I'm still working on.<p>But what about my CS friends?  Some of them are legitimately well-rounded and interesting people... and some sold their souls at 100 hr/wk at nyc firms making 100k but they'll never see the world with the appreciative eyes of the destitute - they'll always want more because that's all they've ever been taught to value.  Many will live lives hopelessly seeking satisfaction through abundance.<p>Save your pity for those guys, thank you.<p>PS: I don't really think all these guys are doomed because they took high-stress, high-paying jobs, I just wanted to represent the other side of the coin.  Don't assume all LAS grads are forever useless... also, if you have the means, hire one. (specifically, me)",1280082732

So...<p>I find that it all starts when you eat when you're not hungry. This may be the product of a need to reassert control via some of the feedback loops described below, but suffice it to say, it often starts there. However, very often it begins via the fixed 'scheduling' of eating times in our society, despite the fact that we may need a variable # of meals per day and it may vary based on workout, stress, your mind, etc.<p>So here's the progression:<p><pre><code>  (a) eat when you're not hungry
  (b) leads to not eating *enough* during a meal time
  (c) leads to feeling hungry in between meals. 
  (d) leads to cravings and short-term satisfactions 
  (e) further increases not eating *enough* during a meal time
  (f) goto (a) and (c)
</code></pre>
Goto considered harmful. So the key to breaking the cycle is eating a large meal and then not eating until you're hungry.  Everything in moderation, of course. But yeah -- older, wiser cultures, imho, eat one large meal a day. In the U.S., we tend to eat two (either big breakfast and big dinner, or big lunch and big dinner) or three. In Europe, sometimes they have just one (sometimes lunch, sometimes dinner). But the key is to remember that nature and evolution are in your favor. Listen to it -- i.e., listen to when you're hungry and when you're <i>not</i> hungry. Although, again, while the body is pretty good at adapting to whatever the circumstance, where possible don't let social conventions confuse you... Social conventions are young on the evolutionary scale. Large meals, despite what people say, are as old as hunting/gathering (and note, this doesn't apply to strength training where you may be trying to gain weight, etc. -- or if you're a farmer, in which case a big breakfast is critical as you're going to burn more calories than many professional athletes -- but, imho, there is a confusion in the Midwest and a large part of our society about too many large meals -- i.e., people are no longer farmers but the social conventions haven't caught up).<p>Also, final caveat. I'm just a programmer trying to figure things out. Probably I'm a hypodiscontinuist (i.e., I fear the discrete breaks in otherwise continuous systems).",1280081947

I've replaced them with fruits and veggies.

Plus I had very high scores on inventories that are used to measure anxiety and depression. Also, SPECT and fMRI studies show that people with depression and anxiety have very different brains than people who are mentally healthy, indicating that some people have a baseline level of resilience that's higher than others.  And tough love doesn't work. It's just another way to beat up on people who already feel beaten down.  I still agree with most of your points, though.",1280081005

This way you can stave off getting really really hungry which is usually the main problem in eating bad.<p>* Eat many meals with smaller portions. How I started doing this was to just eat half of whatever sandwhich, burrito I had bought and eat the rest after 3 hours. This is a good way to start getting into the habit of eating 6 small meals instead of 3 big ones.<p>* Start cutting down on processed food. Stick to meat, veggies and fruit. You dont need to be strict about it - just keep decreasing how much processed food is in every meal.<p>* Stop drinking anything other than plain soda, water, near 0 calorie drinks. The easiest way to do this is to get flavored seltzer water. 0 calories but still more ""fun"" to drink than water.<p>This will get you into a healthy state and keep you there. Losing poundage after this ""state"" is going to be harder but all it means is taking each of these rules to the extreme:<p>Ie only meat, veggies(the weird thing is you can eat as much of this as you want and you wont get fat) and fruits occasionally. Only water, seltzer. Eat every 3 hours with a bunch load of protein in each meal. This plus weight lifting will get you a six pack. Simple but not easy :).",1280080861

Nervousness, social stress, anxiety etc. So don&#x27;t feel bad, people who interview applicants a lot know this. It&#x27;s not a mark against you. If they are interested in you, they&#x27;ll find a way to learn if you have the knowledge/skills they require for the job.<p>If I don&#x27;t know the answer to a question or if it is ambiguious, I tell them. For example, I was once asked to describe how a TCP sessions ends. Well, that&#x27;s implementation defined. What OS? Are we talking FIN ACKs or do TCP resets count as ending a session too? The RFC may say this, but in the real-world, software sometimes does it like that. Etc, etc.<p>And, many times the questions aren&#x27;t made to be answered, but to draw things out of you (like the one above). And in these cases, you can turn the questions back on them. Put them on the answering end ;) and that&#x27;s OK, those exchanges tell both sides a lot about the other.<p>I do like a few black and white questions. Like, &quot;How many bits are in an IPv4 address&quot; or &quot;What data structure is a C++ set typically implemented in&quot; and if candidates have no idea on an answer, then I do have concern over that.

During code reviews? When you&#x27;re in the room with clients?</i><p>Of course not. Interview situations are very, very different than the others. Meetings and code reviews are with co-workers, whom you know and trust. Meetings with clients could be nerve-wracking for other reasons, but they&#x27;re unlikely to challenge your depth of coding knowledge.<p>For my own personal example, I once interviewed at a place where the interviewer wrote up some HTML on a whiteboard, and then asked me to write out the CSS next to it that would turn it into a horizontal drop down menu.<p>I don&#x27;t work that way. I sit with my editor in one screen and a browser window in the other, and I piece together the layout as I go along. I assure you, it works just fine. But the interview situation was so far divorced from any every-day working situation that it felt very unnatural.<p>I opted out of returning for the second round of interviews. The next place I interviewed I sat down, in front of a computer, with the interviewer, and we talked through code as I wrote it. I took the job.",1377104228

Instead of finding another job, I want to start a company of my own.<p>However, thanks to a few expensive things that recently happened in my personal life, I&#x27;m not sitting on a massive savings account and only have a couple of months runway.<p>I&#x27;ve read in multiple places that a CEO should not pay himself, and if he does, he should pay himself next to nothing until the company is comfortably profitable. I cannot live on nothing and my spouse is arguing for me to get another job rather than empty our savings account.<p>My question:<p>How big a problem is this, in terms of fundraising? If I got some funding (incubator, angel) and wanted to pay myself the bare minimum to cover my rent and other costs, would this be seen as a naive or un-committed move? If I told potential investors upfront that I needed a small salary, would I be laughed out of the room?<p>I would obviously focus on a startup idea that could bring in revenue very early on, but as you all know, this isn&#x27;t as easy as it sounds. I&#x27;m also learning about the lean startup approach to really try and get customer validation before I spend time building things.<p>The other options I can see are: to do some custom or contract work and turn it into a startup (the customer-funding approach), or to bring in income some other way (teaching, consulting) that complements it.<p>Thoughts?

I actually understand this issue -- I&#x27;ve been trying to switch careers into programming for the past year.  I&#x27;ve know several languages well (Python, JavaScript, some C), can use git, and have a few decently impressive projects on my Github profile.  I also contribute to a pretty well-known open source project.  As a result, it&#x27;s not hard for me to get an interview.  Nonetheless, I&#x27;ve discovered that despite being very good at interviewing in my prior (well, still current) career, I completely freeze when I interview for programming jobs.  Programming interviews seem incredibly confrontational compared to my current profession.  Interviewers seem to be out to trick you at something, or else to prove how much smarter they are than you.  So I predictably freeze in these types of situations, to the point where I blank on things that I can usually do, even under pressure.  It&#x27;s been a big shock for me, since I did very well in school and went over a decade without &quot;failing&quot; an interview (i.e., taking an interview and not getting an offer) before attempting to transition into programming.<p>But I love programming languages and software development, so I do contracts from time to time, which always go well. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve not yet done a contract that was actually for a company that was actively hiring employees (most were for small businesses with no full-time developers).

Do you mind if I talk through this problem with you as I would if we were working on the job together?&quot;<p>Short contracts can be great when you can afford them (ie, have time/are not currently otherwise engaged), but sometimes you have to work within the framework provided. Being your own salesperson is not all that complicated: manage expectations, build rapport, and under sell/over deliver.<p>A good recruiter can help fill in these gaps for you -- pre-setting the hiring managers expectations, coaching you up on interview strategy and tactics, and helping you understand a given company&#x27;s interview process in full so you can mentally prepare. Unfortunately, most recruiters are <i>not</i> good and dealing with them tends to be a pain. We&#x27;re building a better recruiter, online, at Mighty Spring (<a href=""https://www.mightyspring.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mightyspring.com</a>).

Otherwise I use\nsome scripts I&#x27;ve written in\nmy favorite scripting language.<p>To do this development I read through\nabout a cubic foot of books and \n4000+ Web pages of documentation, nearly\nall from Microsoft&#x27;s Web site.<p>For the development I struggle some\nwith &#x27;scope of properties&#x27; in CSS\n(which apparently is nearly never\ndiscussed) and much of the documentation,\nbut otherwise from the server farm\narchitecture to the\ncomputing to be done down to the lines\nof code and documentation, there are\nno problems.  E.g., for a single\nWeb page, say, X, there is a\nfile X.ASPX, and it has some \noptions, some static HTML and CSS,\nsome &#x27;event handlers&#x27;, e.g.,<p><pre><code>     Sub Page_Init\n     Sub Page_Load\n     Sub Page_PreRender\n     Sub Page_Unload\n</code></pre>\nsome Visual Basic\ncode, a lot of use of classes from\nASP.NET, ADO.NET, etc., and \nsome include files for CSS,\nfunctions, classes, etc.  Fine.<p>And I don&#x27;t have even as much as\na weak little hollow hint of a tiny\nclue what MVC is or why I should\nwant or need it.  The explanations\nof just why I should want MVC\nlook to me as burdensome and \ntotally meaningless\ndistinctions and constructions\nfor no good reason.\nSame for a\n&#x27;framework&#x27;.  Same for Nancy\nand everything else in the OP.<p>E.g., the OP talks about GET\nand POST &quot;methods&quot;.  I don&#x27;t\ndo those things -- IIS and ASP.NET\nhandle those for me.  If I want the\nactual post data, then it&#x27;s \navailable to me via some ASP.NET\nclasses.  But the code I write\ndoesn&#x27;t deal very directly with\nGET or POST.<p>And have I found no good explanation of\nwhy I shouldn&#x27;t just continue\nas I am.<p>I don&#x27;t have a clue what OP is\ntalking about.<p>My guess is that MVC, Nancy,\netc. are for programmers with\nbackgrounds in Web development on\nLinux who want to program\non Windows and there use programming\ntools and techniques they used on\nLinux instead of just the usual\nWindows IIS, ASP.NET, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve already read a cubic foot\nof books and 4000+ Web pages of\ndocumentation, and my work is going\nfine; why should I junk my\nwork to date, read a lot more\ndocumentation, involve myself\nin more overhead of tools instead\nof just going my real work?<p>More documentation can have errors;\nmore tools can take me farther from\nthe real data and can have bugs.<p>Am I doing something seriously\nwrong?",1377101687

Conflating the two, then asserting that civilians may not understand and are unequipped to discuss the two separately, is toxic to discussion and society as a whole.  It <i>is</i> an attempt to remove civilians from the discussion, a discussion that they absolutely <i>must</i> be apart of.<p>As much as some people may wish it, this ain&#x27;t <i>Starship Troopers</i>.",1377100929

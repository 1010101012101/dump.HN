The sad reality is that it seems like in my field of work the dependencies on others is enough to make such a move very risky.

Zach has a reputation for have a strong creative hand in film and tv projects which have had a very strong connection with fans, as his work on Garden State has demonstrated. The same goes with the Veronica Mars team. Had Rob Thomas or Kristen Bell tried to use Kickstarter for some non-Veronica Mars related project they may not have received as much enthusiasm, because Veronica Mars as a project and as an entity on its own definitely has fans and definitely engenders a significant amount of trust that they'll deliver a product that is worth the investment.<p>Also, I don't think you have any concept of Zach Braff's reputation or following, and I suspect this project will probably exceed its goal faster than the Veronica Mars project did.",1366811793

I stopped going to movies when I didn't need to find a place to make out with my girlfriend anymore and I stopped watching fiction movies when I got bored of seeing the same old stuff over and over.<p>He should list this in his discussion of risks, in that he never quite explains why its bad to put the financiers in editorial control of his movie, although they clearly do a good job of narrowcasting typical formulaic movies (to the small fraction of the population who likes that kinda stuff and therefore might not like his stuff).  Also as per the narrowcasting comment his movies now sound interesting to me although I got bored with movies and stopped watching a long time ago (like most people, looking at percentages).  So his risks section also needs a better plan to reach outside the usual movie going public than a kickstarter and maybe the Sundance festival.<p>He may get more money from the general public if he writes to a general public audience who has no idea who he is, rather than what appears to be indie movie fans.  I'm not asking for a major editorial content change, just add another 10% length explaining why would the average dude off the street who doesn't do the movie thing since he was a kid, care, much less send him some dough?<p>Note that I've personally sent/kickstarted Jason Scott the nonfiction documentary producer enough to buy a plane ticket or two over the years, this isn't a new idea.<p>Now this is assuming what I got out of imdb and kickstarter has any relation to reality.  Maybe Garden State is just another boring romantic comedy or teen fart joke formula movie.  Can anyone who's actually seen his movies, comment?",1366811445

Here is how I know:<p>There are news services that are dedicated to delivering important information that could affect markets as <i>quickly</i> as possible. I heard the news from one of these services directly before the market seriously dropped. The important question is <i>why</i> the markets reacted the way they did. There seems to be a sentiment that these sorts of moves are catastrophic and avoidable, but the reality is that these are movements reacting to real information from the environment that will affect the future state of economics. When bad news develops, more efficient markets drop faster in anticipation for this current or future event. This means that the information, or the bad event, has been diffused among the population.<p>With the AP situation, the news of such an extreme terrorist act would surely cause unbalance throughout Western economies; disrupting peace, supply chains, and many companies. This would have a direct impact on equities like the DOW. Within two minutes of the fake tweet, it was reported as being fake and the markets rebounded. In fact, I would guess that the <i>majority</i> of people hurt by this volatility spike were market making or algorithmic traders. They either were directly linked to twitter text feeds, selling on the way down and buying at the top of the retracement; or dump positions put on earlier in the morning. Of course, if the event happened, these traders would have been the winners.<p>The problem with this current situation is that the high-speed news delivery services spread this fake tweet without any verification (except trust that the AP feed is trust-worthy), and people with <i>direct access</i> to these services were most likely individuals with access to trading accounts, allowing them to drop a variety of assets, most notable the DOW or S&P.",1366811329

So costs are a crucial part of the equation.<p>And a lot of people say, So what? Well, think about this. Were lucky enough to get a 7 percent return on the market. That means it should not surprise anybody that investors as a group divide up 7 percent. Suppose it costs two percent  maybe a little bit high but in the ballpark  to gain that return. Then investors who grossed 7 percent will net 5 percent.<p>Now, when the markets going up, as it did in the 80s and 90s, at 17 percent a year, 2 percent doesnt seem like much. But its an awful lot.

(except 50% of nothing).<p>the same thing applies to options contracts or anything else.<p>What I mean is as an early employee you can SEE all this in writing.  As a cofounder, you also get to have your equity agreement on paper.  If it's 50% it even means something.  As a minority cofounder (e.g. if you're the 10% guy with the other two having 45-45) that would mean considerably less.<p>I just don't see how you can anywhere NEAR approach the level of trust as an early employee, that you need as a cofounder.  It's not even within three orders of magnitude of each other.<p>And that's part of why there are so many fewer cofounders than employees in the world.<p>I mean think about it!!

Game ""AI"" exist in a limited, artificial world; so they can get away with ""simple"" algorithms without any learning elements. General AI needs to operate in the real world (even if constrained to a particular domain), where the ""rules"" are too numerous and complex to program in advance; thus learning is an essential part of ""traditional"" AI.",1366809240

Indeed, automatic and stable generation is essential in case of big, procedurally generated scenes, and it would be in general a nice achievement for the field.\ngmaslov provided links that explain some common ways of generating navigation meshes, that quickly looked to me like improved/refined application of the ""flood filling"" method. I just wanted to point out that there is a very interesting way (imho) of generating a 2D/multilayered navigation mesh, which is, by computing the Generalized Voronoi Diagram of the obstacles and then by annotating the vertices (and thus edges) of the graph with information about the closest obstacles' points. This way, we have both a ""backbone graph"" and a subdivision (a mesh).

Currently ""we"" (for some definition of ""we"") are in a pretty intense melt-up era which is at the end of a growth period.  Low trading volumes, irrationally almost insanely high equity prices given technical stats, etc.  Meltups always precede meltdowns.  So the market is strongly prepared to drop and the slightest garbage news causes a momentary drop.  This isn't a ""story"" or a ""surprise"" its just part of the endless cycle.  Rather soon we'll have a real substantial drop, a moderately deep recession, then recovery, growth, etc.  Well, at least in the past we've always recovered so we probably will again, or even if main street never recovers (like last time) wall street surely will recover... eventually, at least nominally (aside from inflation).<p>Now if this happened at a different point in the economic cycle, perhaps near a market low, rest assured nothing  interesting would have happened, at least in comparison.  That doesn't mean certain unrelated things are suddenly less relevant like twitter social media or AP mainstream media or HFT (What does HFT have to do with this other than being the current bogeyman for the financially intentionally ignorant and/or rabblerousers?)<p>A tolerably good engineering analogy if you understand the 4-cycle internal combustion engine cycle, sometimes it pings under really intense conditions.

Do the same ""stuff"" during the intake cycle and you don't get a ping (please no bad analogies to old fashioned carburetor backfires).

Not only is it free and translated into numerous languages it is also searchable and interlinked. If I want to read about Aaron Burr, or the Second Congo War, or spherical harmonics it takes a fraction of a second to bring up an article. And that's been my habit for the last several years, to look stuff up, to find out facts when curiosity strikes. No doubt many other people have developed the same habit, how has it changed the nature of the world?<p>Meanwhile, I can discuss topics of endless variety and depth with people from all over the world. I have personal friends who live all over the US and other countries. When a friend of mine went to Australia for business recently the biggest problem in keeping in touch was merely the time difference.<p>I can loan money to people all over the world through microfinance sites like kiva.org. I can directly support the advancement of the developing world in a very personal, very concrete way.<p>The internet makes direct support of artists and artisans not just practical but downright advantageous for most creators. Whether it's amazon or a personal webstore or etsy or kickstarter or indiegogo, I can find people whose work I enjoy and I can put money directly in their pockets with much less overhead and intervening red tape than has ever been possible before. And this has led to many artists and creators being able to live off of their work and spend more time on their work who would never have been able to before the internet.<p>In the next 2 or 3 decades something quite remarkable and unprecedented will happen in our world. Our world will become connected. All of it. Not just the 1-2 billion people who have access to the internet today. Everyone. The developing world, people living in backwater failed states, everyone. From the arid depths of Mali to the mountains of Tajikistan to the hustle and bustle of Mumbai to the slums of Manila, access to computers and to the internet will be nearly universal. This may seem unlikely from the perspective of today but it's right smack on the path of technology and economics, it's pretty much inevitable. This alone will lead to a significant inflection point in the development of the poorest parts of the world, likely accelerating development in ways we can't even imagine today. But it will also lead to a profound change in character of the world, in the information that people have available, etc.<p>And it will happen not because of the diligent work of NGOs or of UN special offices or of foreign aid. It will happen because things like twitter, facebook, google maps, and so forth created an overall smartphone landscape which was enticing enough to cause the wealthiest people in the world to spend considerable amounts of money buying smartphones. And in the process subsidizing the development of the core technology of the most easily mass-produced and most intuitive to use computing devices in history. Smartphones and tablets are just a handful of chips, a battery, and a screen, they have fewer components than any other computing device and each component is immanently vulnerable to amortization of fixed development and manufacturing costs. The chips and screens of today that go into a several hundred dollar device will over the next few years and decades drop by an order of magnitude or more in cost, putting such devices within the grasp of even the poorest people in the world.<p>And we are only now at the very earliest stages of this revolution in computing and its impact on the world. This is a monumental event on the scale of the invention of agriculture, it is a turning point in human civilization.

24447,comment,24380,24380,0,0,dummypointer,,,"I personally think AdSense sucks. I was really fed up with those clingy, annoying ads and started using FireFox extensions. I even personally suggest my friends to do so. I'd prefer DoubleClik's banners instead. At least they have some aesthetics and creativity ( very few of them though.)Google has successfully fooled the advertisers. Don't you think so?<p>Its not just the stupid-looking ads but my privacy is also in their hands every time any Google Ad shows up on any website. I am assuming that you guys know how Google Ads work!<p>I don't think they will be able to make much money out of it in coming years. And,users will definitely rise up against Google to regain their privacy.",1180039898
24446,comment,24271,24271,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've built a business solo, and I'm now building one with a co-founder.  I can say, without hesitation, that the latter is better.  I'm a lifetime loner, stupidly independent, and I don't play well with others, but having a co-founder is still a major net win for me.  I'm lucky in that I've been working with my co-founder for years (I used to hire him for UI development work when I ran my previous company), so I know that our various skills and our personalities mesh well.<p>If you can't find a founder that fits well with you, and that you can trust not to screw you at the first opportunity, then going it alone is the only option.  But, I'd recommend trying to find a co-founder.  Sure, you can build a successful business solo...but it gives you much worse odds.\n",1180039841

Most folks working other languages would do well to pick the most popular CPAN module for a given area and re-implement it in their preferred language as a way to get a jump on development.

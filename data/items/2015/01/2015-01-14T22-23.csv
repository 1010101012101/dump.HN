I&#x27;ve had this issue before with other US banks and it was fairly trivial to get a Chip & Pin card instead.<p>So I spoke to Capital One&#x27;s CS, I explained I was going to Europe and needed a C&P card. They then read out this statement about C&P rollout in the US and how they would be replacing all Capital One cards within the next 12 months (or similar).<p>I told them I was leaving in just over a month, and that magnetic strip cards don&#x27;t work in much of Europe (which is true, a lot of places have physically removed magnetic strip readers now).<p>So they re-read out selective parts of the statement about the US rollout and said they cannot provide me with a C&P card and &quot;not to worry your card will work fine until then.&quot;<p>I was and still am flabbergasted. It is like they weren&#x27;t even listening to what I had just said. The worst part? This is a card which advertises itself as having &quot;No foreign transactions fees&quot; as a major perk, yet they don&#x27;t offer C&P for people who, you know, actually travel? Mind boggling.<p>I bet before this US C&P rollout they were providing C&P to people who asked for them, then they set up some internal process for C&P rollout for all of their customers but confused themselves and now think that they cannot provide it unless you&#x27;re rolled out to...<p>Regardless I just gave up.

Why is it so important that people should have the freedom to not participate in &quot;concerted, nationwide efforts&quot; to fund services that benefit the whole society, while you&#x27;re simultaneously acknowledging that those services should exist.  Taxation seems like such a straightforward, simple way to achieve what you&#x27;ve described, at the cost of a freedom (the freedom to not participate), which is a freedom we don&#x27;t want everyone to exercise anyway (as it means the collapse of the social service in question).",1421276063
8889703,comment,8877812,8884303,0,0,daughart,,,"I agree with what you say about pesticides -- note I said BPA is not comparable with GMO, not that BPA is not comparable with pesticide. In this case, the genetically modified organism would be safe, but chemicals used to treat the organism could be harmful.<p>> If for no other reason than they can produce a lot of a completely unknown and unresearched chemical.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. Metabolic engineering is really hard. In other words, getting an organism to produce a new small molecule is really hard. If it weren&#x27;t, we would have large scale biosynthesis of lots of stuff, instead of relying on chemical synthesis or isolation. Most enzymes have very specific functions. E.g. an enzyme will add a carbon at a particular location on a very specific substrate molecule. There&#x27;s not really the possibility for unforeseen byproducts.<p>What you describe isn&#x27;t really plausible, which is why biologists agree GMOs are safe. A plausible hypothetical for how something bad could happen, and then not be noticed until the product is fed to millions of people, probably doesn&#x27;t exist (based on the fact that one has yet to be proposed).<p>The only exception I know is allergenicity, but this is a general risk. People are allergic to stuff. Any new product is potentially allergenic. All of a sudden quinoa is in vogue.... people could be allergic to quinoa. No unique risk.<p>The toxicity of _Hedysarum alpinum_ is an evolved trait, like most toxicities, that confers some benefit to the host organism. It&#x27;s hard to accidentally create a beneficial new trait in organisms. It&#x27;s even an academic problem in the field--evolution of novelty.

8889652,comment,8887835,8889546,0,0,nyrulez,,,"Thanks - your answer is reasonable. What I was really looking for is a mechanism that demonstrates this:<p>&quot;Animals appear to be delineated by clear species simply as a function of our perspective from a single time slice. If we could observe gradual change over millions of years, we would see many splitting branches and merging branches, branches that get further apart and then seed an explosion of many smaller branches (i.e. when say land animals split from birds), etc etc.&quot;<p>The idea of gradual change is fine to me - and the term species seems to create too much confusion. But the fact that gradual change over time can create seemingly distinct states (lets not call them species) still boggles me mind when I try to conceive of the mechanism. Is asking that question a red-herring or completely unreasonable ? In fact that is the part I find most fascinating. The fact that the change was gradual doesn&#x27;t preclude from the fact that this gradual change did lead to states which were observed to be quite distinct. One doesn&#x27;t preclude the other.<p>To explain more of where I am coming from: As a person who writes reasonably complex software for a living, I am amazed by the &quot;software&quot; in the brain if you will i.e. its remarkable cognitive capacity for many tasks that we are still in the process of replicating in AI. I find it hard to understand how this could arise as a step by step gradual change purely aided by a favorable set of environmental properties. So something to that effect would be really cool to understand (And even emulate or copy in our software development practices). I am a bit disappointed that there are no simulations that can be done or we don&#x27;t understand the mechanisms well enough to do this.<p>For a very specific example, it would be cool to simulate &quot;This is how the eye came into being.&quot;. Not just enumerating the commonalities between eyes of different species - I find the &quot;commonality&quot; argument as being &quot;factual evidence&quot; of origin of the eye very weak personally. I know its been accepted as fact by most or everyone else but something that would demonstrate the underlying &quot;gradual&quot; principles at work to evolve an eye for example would be uber-cool and satisfying in my book.

I also listed information about the metropolitan regions with the highest officer, first-line management of officers, and software developer salaries.<p>I am unsure as to what your point is. Should I have included cost-of-living adjustments? That seems unduly difficult for the point I was trying to make, which itself was an order of magnitude above the written effort by Spooky23 in making those statements in the first place.<p>The numbers I reported already seemed tilted since I excluded the two highest paying states (California and Washington). Even then, software developers were still making 15K/year more than the 75 percentile of police officers (patrol and first-line). The full analysis would also have to define what &quot;hick&quot; means; I arbitrarily decided it was the bottom 20 or 30% of salaries. I strongly doubt this is true.<p>There are 954 people in the Deputy Sheriff Retirement System of West Virginia. this is essentially confirmed with <a href=""https://www.wvretirement.com/DSRS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wvretirement.com/DSRS.html</a> which says &quot;DSRS currently has approximately 990 active members and 299 retired members.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_wv.htm#23-0000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_wv.htm#23-0000</a> says there are 3,500 &quot;Police and Sheriff&#x27;s Patrol Officers&quot; for West Virginia, and 410 &quot;First-Line Supervisors of Police and Detectives&quot; with median wages of $37,830 and $54,910, respectively.<p>You can see that Deputy Sheriffs don&#x27;t make much ( <a href=""http://woodcountywv.com/page/page149.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://woodcountywv.com/page/page149.php</a> says Annual Salary $32,603, <a href=""http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Berkeley-County-Sheriff-West-Virginia-Deputy-Sheriff-Salaries-E205517_D_KO38,52.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Berkeley-County-Sheriff-West...</a> says $36K, <a href=""http://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/tri_state/west_virginia/berkeley-county-sheriff-s-deputy-resigns-another-reassigned/article_df152604-1c5c-546d-a713-07fecab09f94.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/tri_state/west_virginia/...</a> says $36,048.)<p>Thus it cannot be that most of the police officers employed in West Virginia retire in the Deputy Sheriff Retirement System because some 75% of the police officers are not deputy sheriffs.<p>As a further refinement of your numbers, <a href=""https://www.wvretirement.com/DSRS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wvretirement.com/DSRS.html</a> reports &quot;Active members contribute 8.5% of their gross monthly salary pre-tax and the Sheriff&#x27;s Office contributes an additional 12.5% of the member&#x27;s gross monthly salary...

On p187 it says that 1 pensioner made over $60K/year in pension, 1 made over $48K, and most (168 of 272) made under $24K/year. It also says that plan is set up to earn 7%/year. The math to see if that all works out is not something I want to do now.<p>Under my earlier numbers, I estimated a software developer salary of $93,486, which is about 20% higher than the officer salary of $77,683. With access to the same pension savings fund, doesn&#x27;t that make the two salaries roughly equivalent, and give the software developer a chance to retire after 20 years?<p>Of course, there are no software development unions in the US to oversee such a retirement fund.

You want a testable account of how any given species went from what we would call species X to what we would call species Y. There is probably never going to be such a level of resolution in our analysis that would satisfy even the staunchest naysayer. To really comprehend evolution requires an imagination capable of extrapolating a given set of principles into a framework that entails the very minuscule available data we do have under one encompassing theory. That theory is evolution. It is not something that can be fully understood in isolation.<p>This doesn&#x27;t directly answer your question, but this was a key insight that finally made the entire picture click in my mind. Your question of wanting hard evidence of cross-species evolution is a red-herring and a distraction to your understanding. The concept of species is not a biological reality. Any definition we can come up with for a species, we can find many instances that break the definition. What we see as a species is just groups of individuals who have exchanged genes in recent history. There is no demarcation to delineate a transition between one species and another: (in the case of sexual reproduction) at every point a child can mate with its parents, with no exceptions (except for degenerate cases). This is true for every species that sexually reproduces, going all the way back to the origin of sexual reproduction. The reason groups of animals that represent a unified gene pool look so different is that groups of individuals fall into stable states with their environmental niche, while other groups fall into other stable states for other niches. Animals appear to be delineated by clear species simply as a function of our perspective from a single time slice. If we could observe gradual change over millions of years, we would see many splitting branches and merging branches, branches that get further apart and then seed an explosion of many smaller branches (i.e. when say land animals split from birds), etc etc. But in reality, every individual is a single branch on this tree. What we judge as a species are just branches that are &#x27;close together&#x27; in this tree such that they look like a single unit.",1421274120

I think its clear that the standard bog PC or laptop where the end user has admin rights to modify it, install software from arbitary sources, etc just isn&#x27;t going to go away and that the mobile/touch format is extremely limiting outside of a certain use cases.<p>There were minority voices who called this. We said that mobile/touch is wonderful for consuming and trivial tasks, but just can&#x27;t compete with a big screen, big keyboard, big processor, etc.  I remember the Jobsian types yelling us down.  I think for all of Apple&#x27;s innovations, they are still really a consumer/consumption based company.  They&#x27;ll never crack the enterprise productivity egg. There&#x27;s something odd about seeing so many workers carrying both an ipad and a laptop to business trips.  This is also why I think the MS Surface might mature into something that bridges the gap as a single device.

Look at the current state of browser development and how hard it is to push standards like HTML5 or Ecmascript 6 and take a look at the differences on how and when browser vendors implement those standards. And what languages should be supported? Who provides the runtime environments? What about the different devices and their capabilities?<p>Sandboxing is hard, very hard. You would be afraid to even open a browser window if you know enough. If you like to have a strong sandbox, you cannot use plugins. You cannot even use fonts or render images - not to speak of video. Using fancy HTML5 APIs like to access file system or device sensors? Gone. WebGL, well...<p>Ajax made URIs more important than ever. Everyone started to speak about APIs (first Widgets) and a dissertation of a guy named Fielding became really important, because people had to (re)learn the basics of the web (and are still learning). WebSockets are for data streams and you cannot compare that to your typical browsing session.<p>For me, Single Page Applications are nice for Dashboards or simply pages which federate data and are open for longer sessions. I do not condemn them. What I don&#x27;t like are Single Page Applications which exist for the sake of a Fatclient-like experience. It creates so much more complexity when I have to work around the limitations of HTML. Angular, Ember or ExtJS are complex and it becomes a huge dependency/constraint. You have to duplicate so much business logic, because you cannot trust the client. You have to validate everything server-side. That&#x27;s why there are approaches like Dart, GWT/Vaadin or even NodeJS.<p>I like it the other way around - old school. Javascript to enhance, not to enforce. Take Gmail: I like to bookmark important mails. When I open that bookmark, I like to see the message. But Gmail has to boot first. And this is really optimized compared to your usual Angular application. Why can&#x27;t I just see my mail - rendered with plain HTML + CSS. And when I click one (mock) button (e.g. reply), the page becomes enhanced immediately (because it loaded the necessary script in the background). We could even be better at UIs, which do not try to put as much information on the screen as possible. Another good example is Atlassian. I really like their applications. Nearly everything can be opened in a new tab. On each page, I get the main information (the concern) first and when I need more, I can get that - even with heavy Javascript support. Everything that&#x27;s important uses Javascript unobstrusively. I like that. I can link/bookmark that.<p>If you want people or entire businesses to share links and information effectively, Single Page Apps are not the answer.",1421273947

If the woman had lost her sight getting this surgery, then our Monday morning quarterbacking would&#x27;ve been entirely different... or not even reported.

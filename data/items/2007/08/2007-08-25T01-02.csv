Why not just learn to hack? ...""</i><p><i>""Learning how to hack""</i>,  Is like trying to get someone with a <i>""junk food diet""</i> to become a <i>""gourmand""</i> by learning how to cook.  <p>Hacking is a mindset and while you can learn to be a hacker ~ <a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</a> I just can't help but think some are born with the hacking gene(s) (if there is any) and some are not. <p>It goes to the core motivation. Is it just the money? Or it it, hey I can also make money doing this? If you are not into technology, software, building there is always real-estate.<p>",1188006457

There's another factor there, it is that FB/MS profiles can be configured to suit in a determined job, so you may be hiring someone that tricked you.",1188006095

46464,comment,46400,46429,0,0,nickb,,,"I agree with your view as well. I am an employer and if i had an option about learning more about the candidate, I think I would take an option to learn more. Since you're constrained by law about what you can and cannot ask during an interview, learning more about the candidate would be a great way to see how she/he'd fit into the organization. If you're proud of your MySpace and Facebook and you want everyone to be able to see it, I don't see why you shouldn't look for the person on FB/MS.",1188005091

Outsourcing = letting a third party handle a piece of your production. ...""</i><p>Your mistake is equating development to production. Making software is difficult because designing upfront and then expecting the result to reflect <i>""what users want""</i> is an oxymoron. Instead think <i>""just-in-time""</i> design and creation of a software product in very close communication with users.  <p><pre><code>  '... total outsourcing leads to delayed and inferior products due to human factors and mis-communication ...'  
</code></pre>
The real <i>""value add""</i> here is being able to <i>""optomise employee face-time""</i>  with your <i>""unit profit generators""</i> (users) through <i>""space-time""</i> savings of costs per <i>""CSM""</i> (cubicle square meterage), delivering superior ""<i>user expectations</i>"".<p>Outsourcing in this context is just another business fad. Feel free to insert your own business <i>""Buzz words""</i> in place of place of the ones inserted.",1188003889

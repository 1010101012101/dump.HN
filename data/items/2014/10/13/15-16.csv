8449201,comment,8446232,8446232,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"(edited down for size)<p>Problem with this system: it requires input on a single device (the computer), removes an out-of-band authentication option (password), and pushes the requirement for authentication down the stack to a system without a secure connection (e-mail, SMS).<p>In this new system, the password becomes an optional secondary authenticator. Your primary authenticator is now moved to some pre-authenticated service, such as your e-mail (which you have already logged into, presumably with a password) or SMS messaging (which you have already logged into, presumably with a swipe or pin on your phone). On top of that, neither of these uses a secured connection, so MITM/interception are trivial, to say nothing of phishing+CSRF.<p>One of the major flaws with existing out-of-band authentication access is that we assume the user only has one form of input: the computer. If the computer gets hacked [via malware] the user cannot protect themselves. But the future is here, and we carry [networked] computers in our pockets! Turns out the most secure way we can authenticate is via two separate networks and two separate computers using two secured connections. Example:<p><pre><code>  Step 1. User requests to login to HTTPS Site A.\n  Step 2a. Site A prompts User for a password.\n  Step 2b. Site A sends an SMS to User with an HTTPS link to click.\n  Step 3a. User enters password on site.\n  Step 3b. User clicks link on SMS in mobile device.\n  Step 4a. Site authenticates password.\n  Step 4b. Mobile site reads cookie on User&#x27;s mobile browser.\n  Step 5. User is authenticated; both mobile device and computer have access to site.\n</code></pre>\nHere you have two different authentication factors on two independent devices which are combined to authenticate the user. The attackers now have to steal a cookie or auth token from two separate devices at once. This is of course completely plausible, but is a much more expensive attack than any currently implemented. Best of all, the user doesn&#x27;t have to remember the password if they use their browser&#x27;s password manager or a cookie is stored locally.<p>It would be trivial to add this dual-auth method to their existing system, so hopefully they implement that instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, of course, here&#x27;s an attack that could compromise that system. Attacker shows user a phishing password prompt page that uses a browser hack to steal a cookie. Attacker sends an SMS to the user (assuming they found the user&#x27;s phone number) with a link to another site which also exploits the mobile browser to steal that cookie. Now the attacker has the two cookies and can log in, assuming the site does not use an Authentication Manager that detects attackers who steal credentials (only large-dollar sites use these).",1413215739

But the video shows that there&#x27;s a massive amount of complexity under the surface of this model. For example, the wolves in Yellowstone changed not just the number of deer (their prey) but also their <i>behaviors</i>, which is one of the factors responsible for the cascade effect.

And this company is intended to be quite\nnew in some important respects.  The company is necessarily intended to be significantly <i>exceptional</i>.<p>Then, \nthere&#x27;s a nagging issue here:  The <i>best</i> that we \nwant and are looking for may not be much like the <i>rest</i> in either results or qualifications and approach.  So, looking at the <i>rest</i>, or even the ones accepted to YC, or even the best of the YC alumni, may \nnot be a very good way to look for the <i>best</i> for the future results desired.<p>E.g., starting in 1942 or so, can&#x27;t expect to get an A-bomb by drawing heavily on the lessons from the history of bomb making.  &quot;Q.  So, let me get this straight:  You intend\nto build a bomb with the explosive energy of 20,000\ntons of TNT.  And for your second time at bat, you\nwant a bomb of 1 million tons of TNT?  Just one\nlittle question:  What size airplane did you have\nin mind to lift such a bomb off the ground?  A.  Sir,\nwe were thinking of a B-29, and for the first bomb,\ntaking off from the Marianas.  Q.  But a B-29,\nthe whole thing, doesn&#x27;t weight anywhere near\n20,000 tons.  A.  Yes, Sir, we do realize that.\nStill, we believe that we know what we are\ndoing and will be successful.&quot;<p>Can&#x27;t expect to get the first good microprocessor by drawing heavily on\nthe history of electronics back to discrete \ntransistors and vacuum tubes.  Can&#x27;t expect to\nget an iPhone 6 by looking at telephones back to\nblack plastic with a dial and a four foot long\ncotton covered cord.<p>Instead, for such examples\nof exceptional success, need work that is powerful and\nsignificantly new, i.e., necessarily not visible in the\nrear view mirror.  Sorry &#x27;bout that!  :-)!",1413214906

Just in trying to remember tiny copters and things I&#x27;ve had in the past, it would be kind of amazing to me if the power supply and utilization has advanced that much.<p>Any new action-cam is going to be referenced against the ubiquitous GoPro, so I feel ok making a comparison. I have a GoPro Hero 3+, and filming at 1080 the battery only lasts a couple hours. Turn on the wifi, and that time takes a significant hit. As far as I can tell from the renders in the video, this would have a smaller battery than those in a GoPro, but would need to provide more power, since the thing is flying. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong about this, again, just eyeballing form the renders.<p>It&#x27;s a neat concept, and when I first got a GoPro I was surprised by how damn small the thing was, so I imagine camera boards will only get more intriguingly small and effective. I do wonder about the lens though, as it appears to be tiny. Perhaps more is explained in the video which I watched on silent.

If there&#x27;s enough demand for smart people that science and &quot;real technology&quot; companies will train talented generalists up into the specialties they need, then it&#x27;s good. On the other hand, genuine research and technology have been so under-funded that the culture has become parochial and unreasonably elitist (against talented generalists). I deal with a ton of PhD bigotry in machine learning. (I don&#x27;t have a PhD, but I read papers and I&#x27;m more current and, almost certainly, more effective than someone who stopped reading papers 5 years ago.)<p>For example, there used to be BA-level science jobs. There still are-- but they&#x27;re filled by PhDs. Real science has been under-invested for years and we&#x27;re paying a price because a lot of our brightest people don&#x27;t have any experience with real work, because they can&#x27;t get jobs on projects that actually matter.<p>In the 1970s to &#x27;90s, Silicon Valley wasn&#x27;t pedigree-obsessed and talented generalists could &quot;just fucking build it&quot; without having to acquire permissions and credentials. What happened later, unfortunately, is that smooth-talkers moved in, outcompeted us on social polish, and are now raising huge sums of venture capital on lame &quot;social media&quot; ideas and build-to-flip bullshit. Right now, the genuinely talented generalist engineer loses in both theatres. He can&#x27;t get a proper role in the Substance world (real science and technology) because he&#x27;s not a PhD with at least one paper per year since graduation, but he can&#x27;t get a proper role in the generalist&#x27;s promised land of Silicon Valley because the smooth-talking douchebags with lame ideas have taken it over. Between &quot;ultra-hard&quot; science that requires either 5+ year job tenures (to make it worth it for employers to train people up) or advanced degrees, and that typically involves a decade between innovation and profit; and the &quot;easy&quot; social media stuff that any idiot can do (scaling such services is genuinely hard, but tech talent can be back-filled later) there is a &quot;moderately hard&quot; space that is under-explored.",1413214042

However, this isn&#x27;t the case. Say I get a new laptop and throw my old one out or otherwise wipe its drive. Well that&#x27;s no longer part of the distributed network anymore. Of course, you can add to your file storage protocol by shifting files around as nodes go down, but that adds a lot of complexity.<p>Ultimately, the problems that are trying to be solved here are very difficult and I think a satisfactory solution via distributed computing is unlikely unless you are willing to make severe trade-offs (such as the ones I suggested, use trusted servers).<p>Now, making trade-offs doesn&#x27;t make it useless.

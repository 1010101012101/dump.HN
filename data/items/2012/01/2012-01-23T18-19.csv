Statistically, you may be able to determine which works better as a whole, but nobody will negotiate their salary enough times to render a proper sample. I'd guess that treating each salary negotiation uniquely will produce a higher mean salary than simply changing the ""who says $ first"" variable.",1327345192

If you SSH into a server, kick off a long running job, and get disconnected, it depends on a lot of factors whether or not that job completes.  Generally though, you can consider yourself screwed.<p>Instead, if you connect to a server via SSH, then launch screen, the session is pushed or persisted to the server.  You get disconnected, and you can log back in to the server via SSH and reattach to the screen.  Any jobs you kicked off are still running, and you're returned exactly to where you were before you were disconnected.",1327345115

A skilled negotiator will seize on this and anchor the negotiations in at a very low rate.  You need to know your number ahead of time, and drop it on them like it's the most natural thing in the world.<p>Your initial offer should be high but not ridiculous.  (Unless you really are <i>that</i> busy with work and you don't want the job anyway, then give them a ridiculous number, and see what they say.  Sometimes they'll say yes anyway).<p>The number could be 2x whatever you make currently, or 2x whatever you think they will pay, but the important thing is that it's high, and you say it with confidence and act like it's reasonable.

There is also google, stack overflow and a waltz of easily accessible information on how to do X in language Y that was not online then.<p>I am drawing a distinction between coding and programming. Let me explain - When I graduated from college in 1999 the career office was very assertive that I should use and describe my ability with the MS Office productivity suite. When and how it had become an important enough to include on my resume doesn't matter, it was an important skill to have for the types of jobs I was going to be applying for. So programming and programmers will always have to dive deep and be able to develop complex systems. I am using the word coding in the same context as what I started with: I worked in a laboratory and collected lots of scientific data. I learned how to automate the tedious parts of manipulating, formatting and emailing out the results to save my time and reduce the errors I made doing it manually. To me, this was a self taught journey to learning to code with vba and even back in the first half of the Aughts there were decent places to figure things our for VBA.<p>I think in the future, kids or prospective employees in general that are not programmers, being able to put ""can write JavaScript and VBA to automate repetitive tasks"" will not be required. But, the candidates who can will have a marketable skill that sets them apart from their peers even though they are both trying to get a job in Supply Chain or Regulatory Affairs.<p>And these days, JavaScript is very easy to get started with, fire up a modern browser, open up the console and type in your program on any web page. It's been a while since I worked with VBA but I assume it is discussed on stack overflow.",1327342716

But it should be noted that this does not indicate a change is societal attitude towards geeks.  Linus Torvalds is not a household name. Zuckermann is well known, but he is a business success and celebrated for his business (and yes, social), and not technical, acumen.<p>- The field, in my experience, is one of the most meritocratic in existence today in our society (which is the primary reason I continue a professional practice).  I would code for fun, regardless.<p>- But, it is certainly true in my experience that the workforce was and remains preponderantly male, although it seems to have improved (but see below).<p>The <i>summation of above considerations</i> gives support to a thought that is further reinforced by a consideration of the female colleagues I have worked with over the past 20 years:<p>Every single one was either an immigrant (1 Israeli, 1 Romanian, 1 Pakistani, 1 Brazilian, & recently quite a few Indian and/or Russian/Eastern European women), or, the designated brainiac social minority group that themselves celebrate cerebral members, e.g. Jewish and Asian Americans, etc.  In fact, my first female coworker (who happened to also be my boss/team-lead) was a Cooper Union grad and a Chinese American.<p>Finally, let me tell you a very simple human fact: most of us men in the field would probably be very happy to have a more balanced work environment.  So the thought that we would go out of our way to <i>discriminate</i> against women flies in the face of both personal experience (I interviewed and selected the Israeli and the Romanian as the de facto CTO of a startup in '89), and my general understanding of my fellow male geeks.<p>(Also, note that I made an effort to reach out to a fellow geek (female, of course) that I only know via her github projects.  She confirmed that ""agism"" was what concerned her most.)<p>None of this is to offer a <i>conclusive</i> explanation, but I am of the strong opinion that:<p>when the day arrives that (American) society adopts the same social respect/capital towards its cerebral members that it currently affords business, media, and sports personalities, will be the day that will see <i>young</i> cerebral women make the (intelligent and thoughtful) choice to enter into the field (and related fields, such as Mathematics) in greater numbers.<p>(End opinion)",1327342561

It's not pretty sight, but like a lot of other legends of the ""good old days"", Hollywood ought to understand it's time and place ...in the history! You see, it's not only the technology that is changing (which also happened before, and with some hops and trepidation the classic media industry managed to cope with), but an entire paradigm around it. People are not satisfied with the old ways anymore, and the old ways is what I'm afraid that Hollywood can't and won't get over.<p>Second, it's a power game. When you get so much money to afford paying millions per year to lobbyists, to afford to change the rules of the entire game in your advantage, well... What we see is not coincidence. It's what was expected to happen. It's what happens in other industries also - just rise you head and look around. When you have power, you use it. You must be a fool not to use it. Even if you had some altruism somewhere inside, power corrupts people and when you are so disconnected like you described, it's just a matter of time till you forget things that would otherwise matter. So, when it comes to make judgments and take decisions, honestly - what is there left for you to consider?",1327341993

If you're feeling down, or out of energy, for some reason, if you can manage to get yourself working hard on something, anything, you feel better. The task can range in difficulty from fleshing out that new start up concept, to cleaning your room. For reasons beyond me, this makes you feel better - even when you are dead tired, or super depressed. Sometimes this goes against what you would think follows rationally: if you are tired, a good work out and some rest should suffice. But it doesn't.<p>Similarly, I cannot come up with a good reason why waking up early works. For the past few weeks, I've adopted a new routine. I recently started a 9-5 after shying away from them for years. I wake up at 7, run for 45 minutes (about 4 miles), shower, and go to work. It is unbelievable how good this feels. I'm so addicted to it, that I look forward to my morning run all evening the day before. This is coming from someone who used to feel like shooting himself in the head whenever he had to get up before 9 and who has always suffered from serious sleep issues. (I should clarify that the benefit is not from exercising alone, I used to work out in the evenings when my day was shifted 4-5 hours)<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that you should give it a shot. The benefits go beyond what one can see written on a sheet of paper (i.e., x amount of productivity gained, y amount of sleep gained, etc. etc.) I eagerly await for science to help us understand our complex brains better to understand why these things are so.",1327341799

If your professional environment standardizes on a platform<p>Although employment and social circles DO limit your range of actions, you accept the tradeoff voluntarily in exchange for benefits. You can find a new job or people to associate with if the benefits do not justify the cost, without your employer or friends being able to legally threaten you with violence. On the other hand if you refuse to allow surveillance or investigation by the law, they are authorized to use as much force as is necessary to seize your property, imprison you, or execute you. It's completely voluntary in that regard.<p>""Voluntary"" can be viewed as an antonym for ""coerced"", where coercion implies an underlying threat of violence. Forced denial of an individuals life, liberty, and property can be construed as violence or coercion. Such properties do not presuppose the presence of another person or governing body, so may be considered intrinsic to the individual. However, employers or friends denying the deliverance of their property or empathy to you cannot be construed as violence or coercion. Such exchanges presuppose the presence of multiple people, and therefore cannot be considered the denial of a property intrinsic to one individual.",1327341681

How does a cyberlocker assert who owns copyright or not. Megaupload certainly was shady, but actually, in germany it might be perfectly legal to rip your sopranos DVD, upload it to Megaupload and share it with friends. We do have legal provision for sharing media with friends (actually, we pay a couple of cents for each empty CD or DVD we buy that is supposed to compensate for that). Sharing an episode with the rest of the world remains illegal, but how can the hoster know?
It's certainly clear that megaupload targeted those users, but actually, so does my cable provider. Practically 
noone needs 200MBit connections if not for filesharing.<p>> If a lawyer started posting here on HN or on a programming forum elsewhere claiming that obviously programming language X is better than Y because X has pointers and Y doesn't we'd laugh him/her out of the room too. Why do we think it's acceptable to do the equivalent to other fields?<p>Certainly not. If it were a lawyer who needs to be genuinely interested in my field of work because it directly influences his field of work, I'd be willing to put up with a couple of false statements as long as the general questions remain valid. And whether we like it or not, those lawyers that try to put the megaupload staff in jail may be after our own startup just as fast if we stray too close to the border to what interested parties consider illegal. And those interested parties push the border further and further deep into what used to be plainly technical territory. See SOPA/PIPA or other similar laws that try to push for solutions that are obviously (to us) not technically feasible or even damaging to the underlying technology. Thats why we as well need to try and understand what's going on on the lawyers side of things and why we need to assert how we think things may turn out. Certainly, we do make mistakes and may have incorrect ideas of how the law works, but I still think it's important to write that up and put it up for discussion. You're certainly right to point out errors, but that's just part of the process.",1327341643

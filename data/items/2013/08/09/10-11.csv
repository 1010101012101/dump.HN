And what if terrorist or people with evil goal or activity use this system ?<p>These types of services solve only a little piece of the equation.<p>I now also tend to think that people focusing only on privacy are individualists. A good example of individualism is defending the right to freely own and carry weapons. For rational, well balanced and honnest peoples, it sounds right and harmless as a mean of defense. Like privacy. But it is well know and demonstrated by the numbers that pople are abusing this right and using the guns for bad goals. The trust given to them, not only by the authority, but from nightbours and all honnest citizen as well has been betrayed. In europe where guns are banned and under very tight control, life is much safer. This is very counter intuitive. See ?<p>I now tend to assume, privacy is very similar. If we give up privacy we may become much safer. Of course there must be exceptions, but with tight controls as exist for weapons in europe. Privacy should be available to lawyers and doctors for instance.<p>Finally, a last missing piece of the solution is a feedback loop to control the controllers so that no one can abuse the system, and this includes the government.",1376045818

When you go to the beach and see people in swimming costumes, there isn&#x27;t really much left to the imagination.

(I just saw the Github repos, so I will examine this myself in a bit.)<p>The P2P is done over local networks only. It uses multicast DNS for service discovery. Bluepass syncs between your own devices only. As long as the devices occasionally share a (W)LAN, it will work.<p>> Why should I trust you? What have you done other than this project? Not to be increasingly blunt, but you are not the Mozilla Foundation and your Github repos do not show much other than work on co-routines and AD service wrappers. That is useful to me, but I would like to see more security work and knowledge of crypto libraries if I trust you with password manager code.<p>Well, everybody has to start somewhere. I do believe that I have enough experience with crypto to be qualified here. I&#x27;ve got a physics degree and did a lot of maths. And I read Schneier and Wenbo Mao&#x27;s book cover to cover. Also note that I&#x27;m not using any proprietary algorithms. This is all OpenSSL wrapped algo&#x27;s that I&#x27;m using from Python.<p>But in the end, what should give this the right credibility is that the source code is up on Github, together with my intention to grow a community that can review the crypto. If there is something not right, which can always happen of course, then it will get out sooner or later.<p>> What else do you work on? Your blog does not show me too much, and I cannot find much mention of you to warrant 60,000 USD for such a project. I am correct in seeing you a Marketing/Product Manager? Sorry to be harsh, but honestly I think most of HN would be worried about these points.<p>This is not related to my day job. I would say have a look at the code, and decide for yourself if you like the code.

The use of jQuery is questionable, the use of bootstrap even more so considering how simple the layout is.<p>The pubsub module that pushes new inbox data is pretty great though.<p>* Content:<p>The content pages look great. The little transitions are nice. I like the new copy as well; it helps cement the point that this is not a serious security product and it should not be considered as such.<p>Overall, while it&#x27;s a nice change, it may be a bit more flash than users are actually looking for. The massive assets package makes the actual email page <i>huge</i> - jQuery, Bootstrap, and Angular, just for such a simple page? Combined with web fonts, the total payload is well north of a half meg. Intro transition animations serve to make the perceived time to displayed content even longer.<p>A second pass with a proficient JS developer and a keen eye for readability would do a lot for this site.",1376043392

I don&#x27;t expect to see Rust in the pole position on the whole, but it could easily displace C++ at Id Software since Carmack has been shopping for an alternative, and elsewhere (especially if he runs with it first.)<p>But I think C++&#x27;s share is losing ground, and Unity is an impressive platform. The asm.js buzz seems to whisper promises about ES and browsers becoming a serious AAA gaming platform. If FFOS gets anywhere it may supply the necessary voltage. So the lay of the land is anyone&#x27;s guess, but all the variables eat into C++&#x27;s % share even if only by expanding the market around it.",1376043332

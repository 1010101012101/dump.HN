1124414,comment,1124331,1124331,0,0,mr_eel,,,"The Pixel Qi would go a long way on the battery life. I’m curious about the Tegra tho; the suggestion that it’s has better power-usage characteristics than Apple’s A4. I only know that both are ARM chips. Does it have any effect on performance of video and the like? I’m guessing Apple may be willing to sacrifice battery life for better performance animating the interface, video etc.<p>But, I don’t see how it can kill a product that hasn’t even been released — the iPad — especially when the details about the actual device aren’t exactly rock-solid.<p>From the article: ""…now they’ve sent over renders of what’s likely to be the final Adam design complete with some mockups of a SlashGear digital magazine.""<p>It’s a potential product at this point. It could be a killer, maybe not.",1266144574

1124404,comment,1124146,1124146,0,0,antileet,,,"I've seen so many benchmark comparisons that only focus on conciseness (that too involving lines of code), and speed. Yeah, they all re-affirm what is already known - C is fast, python/ruby is concise, C#/Java is somewhere in between and there are the ones which do well in both - haskell, clojure, etc. (And then there's APL)<p>All the benchmarks are algorithm and processor intensive, while quite a few applications are idling most of the time. How about a comparison regarding the standard libraries, ease of debugging, external tools, code readability, available support, external libraries, etc. In short - developer productivity.<p>I'm not saying performance is not important - it is quite critical, but there are other things code does as well (At least most of my code is mundane, and is just calling APIs, updating files, serializing objects, etc. Nothing too fancy.)\n</rant>",1266144184

If that's not happening, it's probably not the UI's fault.<p>Do an in-person usability test, where you can explain to the person exactly how to use the product (violating all the normal rules of usability testing). If they still don't like the product - either they are not a target customer or you don't have any customers out there. Do the test again - if the same thing keeps happening, you know it's the latter.",1223609434

At least that was my line until recently. Now I have stopped taking reporters' calls.""<p>While he could mean that he's now getting so many requests that he can't be bothered to return them any more, I wonder if instead he meant that he can no longer give the ""it can't happen again"" message. Lending credence to this interpretation I think, he goes on to point out the ways in which the problem could continue to worsen without drastic action.",1223608809

I don't know why you believe that they are panicking in a week that the DOW has dropped about 16%: this will weld the IPO window shut and limit the value of any acquisitions that occur. If their companies are cash flow positive then there is no reason to sell off assets, but if they need more funding to survive it may not be available. If they were to shut them down and return the funds to their limited partners that would be the end of Sequoia: their partners expect them to earn an above average return with the risk capital that they have invested. Some investment firms, Sequoia likely among them will find a way to earn a positive and above average return from their portfolio of investments. They can't do that if they liquidate all of their holdings.",1223608685

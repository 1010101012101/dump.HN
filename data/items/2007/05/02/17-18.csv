Although USA and other non-eastern-european countries are available to register under, you still need a Russian connection somewhere for it to be useful. <p>I also have issues with handing over too much of my info to a Russian company, as their track records aren't that clean.

18769,comment,18531,18531,0,0,stuki,,,"   Dudes, unless the silverlight demos was pure smoke and mirrors, and all involved blatant liars, this is pretty cool stuff. Especially coming from a bunch of dead guys :).\n   This is something I have been hoping for from MS for a decade: website like ease of app delivery combined with a non stone age client programming model. MS is the only one with the size and reach to have any kind of shot at pulling it off. Nice to see they are finally taking their 'monopoly responsibilities' seriously. Supposed monopoly or not, size really does matter when it comes to providing us little guys with assurances that decent codecs and runtimes are present on our target market's computers ( and phones, gaming consoles etc. ). How any developers not in direct competition with MS can not like being able to do rich clients in .net + assorted tools instead of the current mix of hacked together technologies is beyond me. This doesn't mean every app has to utilize a rich client, just that for the ones that do, we can build them in a modern development environment and expect modern runtime performance.\n   Now..... arc.net? Orders of magnitude faster than JS...",1178127394

18765,comment,18749,18749,0,0,willarson,,,"I wonder what the mindset is of someone who duplicates--exactly--not only the functionality, but everything down to the layout and color scheme.\nIt doesn't seem that this kind of venture is going to penetrate very far, especially outside of Russia. Then again, the recent article posted about Friendster mentions they are focusing on smaller Asian countries (Malaysia, etc). I guess this is the web equivalent of a niche company: trading potential success for potential market safety.",1178126985

The concept works, the entry barrier is low, being copied is inevitable unless you move very fast.<p>This isn't a bad thing imo though; the local dev teams understand local culture better. faceren and xiaonei both looked like carbon copies of facebook when I saw it on TechCrunch (or something). If you look at faceren now it's completely different.",1178126524

18760,comment,18675,18729,0,0,edgeztv,,,"Sorry if my previous question regarding the 50k salary & stock came out inelegant.  What I really meant to ask, is whether you're looking for a co-founder or a paid developer.<p>I'm employed as a developer right now and I'm almost ready to quit to start my own startup.  I have a few projects that I've been working on in my spare time, so I'm not sure that I'd want to join another company unless I really like the idea and would be a co-founder.<p>Hope that makes sense.  Once again, sorry if my previous posts sounded like criticism.  I did not intend it that way!",1178126053
18759,comment,18674,18696,0,0,willarson,,,"While the article certainly emphasizes that the non-technical board was a detriment to the company, I think that the fundamental problem is revealed in the quote We completely failed to execute.\nTheir product didn't work well, and this problem existed before the influx of money and board members. Blaming it on the board is conventient, but even the best board can't make a company successful if their product is broken.",1178125880

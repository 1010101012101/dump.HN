Then it was never used for that, and I remember a lot of the televisions going unused.",1216882395

I developed replacement firmward for the Archos handheld multimedia player a few years ago. You couldn't even get documents on the chip. The firmware was completely locked down, compressed+encrypted.<p>These things just make it more fun :)",1216882335

255142,comment,254395,254812,0,0,noonespecial,,,"We did just this. It worked out <i>wonderfully</i>. 200 disposable cameras (hey, it was 1999), 27 pictures each. This is a @#$%load of photos folks. 90% of them were total crap. 7% of them were way-cool novelties, 3% of them were pure gold that no wedding photographer could have captured. We had a traditional wedding potog take the usual pictures that no one looks at as well.<p>Pictures were taken at the wedding, the reception, and the after-party. At the end of it all, we mailed out cd-roms of the best pictures to everyone who attended. (These cd's had, incidentally, also been the invitations. Bring your invitation along, get photos of the event!)<p>I highly recommend it to one and all. Crowd-sourced photos rock.",1216881827

255140,comment,254260,255124,0,0,Tichy,,,"By that logic, Apple should lock OS X and make it impossible to install anything that doesn't go through Apple. I'd like to see how that would go down.<p>Also, I thought Apple promised to let basically every application into the store?<p>Without that, it would be mad to develop for the iPhone. It would be a huge gamble, spending maybe 5 digit sums or more only to hear that you did not live up to Apple's standards and can throw your application into the garbage bin.<p>Maybe there is another reason: maybe sales of mobile applications are a huge market, and Apple simply doesn't want to share.",1216881691

255138,comment,254352,254352,0,0,thwarted,,,"The quick description of Sys::Protect (and it's lack of documentation on CPAN so far) make it seem like an implementation of the Safe module with a preconfigured list of unwanted opcodes.  I'm interested in know why Safe wasn't considered or how Sys::Protect is related, if at all, to Safe (which I believe has been a standard perl module for quite some time).",1216881649

255135,comment,253984,254959,0,0,asdflkj,,,"With that reasoning, all human attributes are physical, so putting ""physical"" before ""attribute"" was redundant. But of course, it wasn't redundant--it had a clear message, and a different one from what you're now making it out to be. This after-the-fact damage control on your part is disingenius.",1216881280

Honestly, without knowing more about what I'm seeing here I don't think it meets News.YC standards. Would this an appropriate use of the 'flag' link?",1216880929
255132,comment,255052,255126,0,0,aristus,,,"Yes, but we can't because of the <i>fucking NDA</i>.<p>Apple makes all potential app developers obey essentially a gag order. Whether it's legally enforceable is an open question, but since they control the platform and app store, Apple have all of the cards.<p>That means: no books, no libraries, no websites, NOTHING because of a fear of being banned from the platform.",1216880924

255128,comment,254569,255064,0,0,unalone,,,"It's a matter of form follows function, always. But form includes the impression the end user gets. That's why big buttons don't always work.<p>For Knol, that feel ought to include a stately manner. Something large buttons don't convey well.<p>With Gmail, there's quite a lot of clutter. Google tends to have a lot of clutter. Curves where you don't need curves, visual tics that don't have to be there. the ribbon that highlights the Inbox. The bulkiness of the selector.<p>I noticed this on Windows, much more now that I'm on a Mac. Google wastes pixels not for functionality but for this idea of a design. They could smooth it out, add much more color contrast, make things more usable while still looking nice, without much of an effort. But they rarely do. Gmail and Google Reader are the two hugest offenders, I find; Maps and their actual Search are good comparisons, because very little space is wasted.",1216880523

The ideal execution of this idea would be much closer to a social game than a collaborative tool.",1216879995
255124,comment,254260,254776,0,0,unalone,,,"No, no. Apple INSISTS on quality products. They don't care if YOU would compromise. They won't let you.<p>I'm guessing you don't use a Mac, or keep close with Mac users. The attitude is entirely one-sided: it's all about quality, period. Many Mac users eschew Firefox for Safari, because the one is so much better-made, even if it doesn't let you use StumbleUpon and whatnot. Word 2008 is attacked by Mac users for feeling too much like Windows. Even the App Store is being attacked right now for being too LOW-standards.<p>Apple's idea is this: if your idea is too poor to be displayed on their store, you should design for something that isn't working with Apple software. That's not a disadvantage. It's a mindset that ensures top-notch design, time and time again. It's why most people will pick up an Apple product and assume that it works well. It's because Apple controls everything, and because that's a good thing.",1216879919

255122,comment,254523,254840,0,0,unalone,,,"Possibly - but I doubt it. Different mindsets.<p>Apple is all about focus. They hone in on little bitty details that require a single mind's perfectionist worldview. No compromises. And I can't think of any multi-man team that focuses that much, excepting the Coen brothers.<p>Google doesn't need airtight focus. Apple does.",1216879701

I know its not anything new, there is OpenID and what not. Although, I really like the facebook implementation. I think it will really help startups/companies in all fronts, easy implementation, support, security, data portability and even generate marketing.<p>Thoughts?",1216879626
255120,comment,254091,254155,0,0,Maro,,,"I meant: you don't show markers after search. (Only after click.) But I think that clicking is rare. Users tend to think that clicking moves them off the page, so they avoid it. In any case, after clicking a result, you only show that one marker right? But then, why is the map so big? It could be much smaller if you're only showing one thing on it, IMO.",1216879606

Rss feeds do this, but only to a certain extent.<p>Also, if it got successful enough they could hire their own reporters.  It would be great to do video clips as well as textual news articles as the site seems to imply, although this would involve a lot more work it seems.<p>In that same vein, I wonder how well a site that streamed talking heads doing news 24/7 could do if the anchors were professionals (i.e. at least up to the quality of cnn,msnbc, fox,bbc, not that they are always the best measure of quality).",1216879415

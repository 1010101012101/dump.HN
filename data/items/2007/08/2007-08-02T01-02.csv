For a typical early stage startup, their offer will be based on things like whether you seem smart and driven, and whether the project seems like it could be really big.",1186019940

We invest in social-media early-stage web startups, putting in between $100-$500k. We maintain specialist resources to help with SEO and Viral Marketing. We provide free office space to our companies, if they want them. We have a one-page no-hassle termsheet, where we buy something that looks a lot like common stock. We don't try to control the company. We help with future fundraising (see my blog at <a href=""http://www.venturehacks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.venturehacks.com</a>). And we decide very quickly.<p>PG pointed this out to me as a gap in the market for early stage web companies, and he is absolutely right.<p>See you all at Y-Combinator D-Day.",1186017988

It's very open (even allowing anonymous posts) but has  community rules that mostly reflect common decency. Over the years I've seen countless disrespectful newbies and trolls turned into contributing members of the community. The solution there has been to have long-time members volunteer to enforce the published rules in a consistent and fine-grained way. It requires implementing a user hierarchy, but we already have that here with the ""editors"". Publishing some rules and systematizing the editor controls would solve most of the problems reddit has faced.

Yes, I've read the book and know what kind of techniques he mentions but it doesn't fit for many businesses.<p>As an example. I could outsource my customer service to someone else, but then I lose that connection between the customer and I. I like having that connection, it allows me to see what my customers are looking for, what irks them, and allows me to further advance my business<p>Basically, I can't stand this book. :)",1208274945

Really, a few hundred thousand would take us miles, but we have to ask for 2M to get in any doors. And even then, we get lots of ""get back to us when you have more traction,"" just as the article states. Bad news, VCs: we won't need you when we get more ""traction,"" because we built monetization into our business model, as a lot of start-ups are now doing.",1208274662

I wouldn't be surprised if this is all just a well executed marketing plan by psystar.<p>The upside: Hundreds of thousands of curious people visit their site to see the company that's standing up to Apple. They may even buy the system to get OS X before it's taken off of the market. The company may even do some damage to Apple's PR by bringing the high prices and 1-1 comparisons to the attention of a lot of people.<p>The downside: Apple tells them that they can't offer this computer any more. There are some other negligible downsides like the cost of removing the product or if Apple sues then they might have to do some ""reverse advertising"" because of a court order.<p>I doubt that this company is going to go through an expensive and lengthy battle with Apple over this.<p>So in the end, I think that Psystar either has a brilliant marketing plan, or just got lucky by all of the coverage.",1208273950

164175,comment,163851,163851,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Somehow, I think the title of the article is a little overblown.  I grew up in Central America, and having had Amoebic Dysentery twice as a child, I know something about bad water. :)<p>Part of the problem is getting the water clean, but another big part of the problem is getting it to the people that are using it.  Growing up, I lived in a city of 1.5 million people that had a water treatment program.  The problem was water delivery.  We lived in a heavy seismic zone, and the water pipes were plastic and the sewage pipes were clay.  So, there were a number of cracks in both, and seepage went from the sewage systems to the delivery systems.  So, water treatment was needed at the kitchen faucet not at the village center.<p>Another issue is that people need to realize that the water makes them sick.  In many rural villages, you don't really think about water making people sick.  They just think that getting really bad cases of diarrhea is part of life, and they think that people just die young.  They don't correlate bad water with dying.  They really need education systems for that.<p>Also, systems are needed that are a lot cheaper than $1000-2000.  In many countries people make about $1 a day.  It's going to take a lot of people that realize that the water is making them sick before they buy something that expensive.",1208273829

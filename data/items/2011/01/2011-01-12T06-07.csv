2095275,comment,2093219,2094710,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"<i>But Google can support Flash and work towards openness</i><p>Here's the thing, though. Mozilla and Google, over the past year, have basically used the video-codecs thing as a publicity stunt. LOOK AT ME I'M SO PURE AND OPEN AND NOT LIKE THOSE VICIOUS CLOSED EVIL APPLE NAZIS (except please please please don't ask us about all that proprietary stuff we still do, <i>please</i>). It's hard not to see this as hypocritical.<p>So it's perfectly reasonable to, for example, call Google out on that. If they're really serious about openness, but need to make some compromises to deal with legacy proprietary stuff, why was <i>this</i> the specific compromise? Why not, say, keep H264 support in the <video> element while encouraging people to re-encode, and cut Flash? That at least gets you progress toward an open standard -- HTML5 -- if not a completely ideologically pure platform.<p>And especially given the fact that H264 has already literally won -- in the mobile market, in the broadcast market, in the home-entertainment market -- while Flash players which spool out H264-encoded video are essentially interchangeable with HTML5 <video> elements which spool out H264-encoded video, it's hard to see this as a genuine move in support of ""openness"".<p><i>It should be obvious that Google's hope is anyone using HTML5 video will eventually move to WebM exclusively.</i><p>This is the real point, I think. Google, I'm pretty sure, doesn't actually give a shit about openness; they care about getting people to use platforms they can control. See the requirements you have to meet to get the <i>actual</i> Android platform (you know, the one with the useful Google apps). See their ongoing spats with sites like Facebook, which are rooted more in Google not getting access to/control over data than any noble attempt to serve privacy. And see WebM, the codec Google owns, and which they're going to ram down everyone's throat via every channel they can use.",1294815443

This allows you to either request news sources manually or have them sent to you on a schedule e.g: Get me the New York Times every morning at 6 and mail it automagically to my Kindle - like having your dog fetch the paper automatically.<p>The site is currently neither beautiful nor comfortable. Please give it a spin and let me know what you think. Please be gentle when requesting many sources on a frequent schedule, this is quite computing intensive and may bog down or crash the system. If the site is down please check back a few hours later. I have upgraded the instance but I know the HackerNews effect can be brutal sometimes.<p>I chose to compile all the recipes on github.com (https://github.com/readbeam/recipes), for all git users out there, this may be helpful.<p>I am especially interested on your views about all the copyright or other legal issues I may face here. My current understanding is - basically - that the manual fetch should be ok, because one person is manually requesting a copy of a site - like when you request a site with your browser and maybe have an adblocker installed.<p>I hope the subscription service is legal as well, because not I am serving the recipes, but the user is. So my line of thought is: I am just offering a hosting platform with an API, you are programming it and doing something 'bad' (accessing e.g. the economist.com site, that is).

Android lacks basic usability touches; the manufacturer customizations don't make things any better. Battery life is dismal. Additionally the system pauses all the time when performing basic tasks.<p>Some of these problems, I think, are fundamental to using a virtual machine for everything. The performance overhead is exacerbated by the less powerful mobile hardware. The garbage collection causes noticeable pauses. And more battery is used to accomplish less.<p>The other problems are rooted in design. Whoever was doing the UI for Google did not understand good UI. Sorry. Impressive looking UI elements waste space, get in the way, and actually slowed me down for no reason. Little iOS UI touches like the elastic scrolling that let you know you're at the end of a list are absent, making you wonder if you're at the bottom of the list or if the device is just taking a break to collect some garbage. I usually scroll repeatedly just to make sure whereas on iOS I see the bounce and I know I'm done immediately.<p>You're on AT&T. As long as you're happy with the service stay there and stick with an iPhone for now. Personally, I would not even consider another Android device until after 3.0 fixes some of the UI problems. And even then I have serious reservations about Android's technical fitness due to the VM.<p>I realize lots of people have all kinds of confidence in Android's technical fitness. People far more accomplished than myself. But whatever. The emperor has no clothes. It might be a good design for a portable OS, but it's not a good design for a mobile OS.",1294814628

But some of dark pools don't necessarily keep quotebooks to be coy, they instead keep a book of ""IOI"" (indications of interests). So in an event where a regular trader get a better price at dark pool versus say BATS/INET, their order wouldn't get redirected to dark pool for execution at NBBO. But if a trade does happen between the participants in a dark pool, if a third-party exchange can offer better price then the pool is obligated to redirect to that market to fill at that price.<p>Your second point of RegNMS requiring exchanges to print all their trades. Dark pool report their trades in their own idiosyncratic way. Suppose a large block order went down, I and my counterparty could agree on a VWAP price and just slowly complete our trade over the course of the day or even several days to obscure the order from the market. So reporting might be done, but it might be done as slow and as obscured as possible.<p>And talking about Credit Suisse, CSFB and other banks used to have a suite of VWAP algo's for their customers but they have curiously not updated the algo in the past 4 years. Why not?

I think we crossed that threshold a long time ago and now we've gone way overboard into the other extreme; our current laws actively discourage creativity, which is the exact opposite of their purpose.<p>Why doesn't your post say, ""It seems many companies don't believe that those that purchase their hardware have a right to use it according to their own dictates.

2095199,comment,2092819,2094164,0,0,noname123,,,"Typical stock exchange is a lot of like eBay bidding auction. A full-depth of quote book is maintained for the best and near-best bid and offers. When a buyer's highest bid price matches with a seller's lowest offer price matches, an transaction is made. For those bids and offers that are below/above the current market price, they are kept on the books.<p>Now HFT algorithms, daytraders and market-makers all monitor this full-depth book for patterns whenever a large order is coming in. Suppose I'm a Fidelity Investment trying to acquire 5 million shares of MSFT for my $20 billion mutual fund, if I just put that huge order out there on the order book. Everyone else will jump in and buy MSFT; front-running me because stock market is like everything else, supply-and-demand; when there's a huge demand and you buy the supply ahead of time, you can charge more and make profit.<p>So to disguise my huge order, mutual funds prefer dark pools where the full-depth of books are not maintained. Instead, it's like shooting fish in the dark. A big mutual fund wants to buy 5 million shares of MSFT at 25, another big fund wants to sell 5 million shares at MSFT at 25. You submit your order to that market totally blind because there's no quote book and just have to see if your order gets filled. But the positive side is that no one could see where the market demand and supply is, so the mutual funds gets their orders filled and not front-runned. Dark pools also typically limit their participants to large institutional investors to limit the information because what HFT firms used to do is to ""ping"" the dark pools, send out random orders to buy 1 share of MSFT at a certain price to see if there's a ""whale"" order out there and then proceed to front-run. So lots of them got banned.<p>Now, the problem with dark pools is that there are sometimes not many people who trade on it because it's ""dark,"" kind of like egg-and-chicken problem, no one could see the full-depth of book and so don't put their orders out there. That's what's called lack of ""liquidity"". Exchanges want to have people trade, because the higher volume, the more people will come and trade on that venue and the more money they make. So this ""light pool"" tries to fix this problem by having ""displayed"" quote book but the market participants are still limited and regulated still to make mutual fund participants comfortable about not being front-runned.<p>Well, as the saying goes, ""it's never illegal unless you get caught""; so suppose if you are a huge fund or a bank with a HFT prop desk. You could register your mutual fund section with this ""light pool"" for its displayed liquidity. Now, you might even do some real trades on the exchange to make everything legit; but feed the market data section for your HFT prop desk which is registered with a totally different LLC designation, and have that fund execute orders on other exchanges based on information from this ""light pool"" (e.g., whale buy order on IBM on ""light pool,"" front-run IBM on BATS).<p>Now for liquidity rebates on these exchanges, exchanges are now locked in a bitter battle to see who can attract the most volume and trades (because it's a snowball effect, more volume, more interested traders who come on to trade, more money). So they offer ""liquidity rebates"" for traders who put orders out there on the full quote-book because the more entries on a exchange's order book means that there are greater potential for greater volume on a exchange. A more concrete example is, let's say I'm a liquidity rebate trader on Citigroup (NYSE: C); C is last traded at $4.30, with national's best bid at 4.29 and national's best offer at 4.30 (NBBO). So I could submit out a sell order for C at $4.30 on the exchange's quotebook (I don't have to physically own C, I could short sell the stock). Now although NBB was at 4.29, someone might come alone and they are really impatient and submit a market order to buy C at $4.30 and they hit my order; now they are ""taking"" liquidity that I put out there on the market. So they are paying the exchange for the liquidity for doing so, typically, $0.02-$0.05/100 shares and to encourage more liquidity providers like me, the exchange passes some of that profit to me, $0.01-$0.03/100 shares.<p>Now a stock like C is heavily traded, there are literally thousands of orders on C's quotebook just between $4.30 and $4.29; suppose that a bad/good news come out on Citigroup, many of the traders who have their offers to buy or sell C at these cents increments might not all cancel their orders to adjust the valuation of C to the new news. This is called ""low slippage,"" that in a high volatile event, you could trade out of your positions very easily with no ""slippage"" as trading in a small cap stock where in a volatile event, no one's willing to trade with you.<p>This is perfect for a liquidity rebate trader who literally goes around all day, offer to sell C at 4.30 and then buying back their short C shares at 4.30. They break even on the trade and get to collect $0.02-$0.05/100 shares liquidity rebates. So you do this over and over again on the market, generating higher volume on the exchanges and get to collect more rebates and everyone's happy at the expense of the liquidity takers. Now, with this exchange, the liquidity rebate is at $0.14/100 shares because they want to be attractive to the liquidity rebate crowd and generate lots of volume; and because the rebate is high, you could afford even higher slippage on C.",1294812927

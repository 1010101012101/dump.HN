99438,comment,97751,98108,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Worthwhile goal indeed, but I think it's a terrible way to try to achieve it. I'd opiniate that one will make much more money from a medium-paying job he's fully passionate about than a high-paying one he doesn't like very much (in the general case).<p>At the very least, you'll be much more happy in the former scenario. I think a good strategy for making a lot of cash is pursuing strategies that are at least moderately sustainable, and that won't result in a total waste if you don't succeed to meet your expectations.<p>For example, I have a startup of my own, and I put long hours on it because I enjoy it and learn a lot! Even if I don't ultimately succeed commercially, I'll walk away from that experience with a net ""profit""!<p>So, to answer your question, I think it's loser to pursue a career you don't really enjoy just to have a shot at winning the ""lottery"".",1200516801

The company I was working for then had an Oracle database and had just switched app-servers from Tomcat to Weblogic, so the idea of both coming under the same banner was not an unpleasent one.<p>Oracle's been doing a lot of acquisitions recently.

99425,comment,99351,99351,0,0,curi,,,"The more advanced aliens are, the more we can make reliable predictions about them. For example, they will have values and ways of thinking closer to what we call ""scientific"" than ""religious/mystical/superstitious/etc."" If they did not, they would not become advanced.<p>Wars are very expensive and destructive. It's hard to become advanced when you keep destroying wealth. On Earth, as we've become more peaceful, we've also become more wealthy, and more able to travel space. The same logic for why this would be so on Earth, applies elsewhere.",1200515522

Problem with SD! is that I would forget to plug my external HD sometimes and the backup would not go through. You can enable to backup TM to a HD attached to AirportExtreme (with a small hack) so that's my makeshift TimeCapsule and works well because I don't have to remember to do anything.",1200515064

I sat there for about 30 seconds deciding whether to vote it up or down.  Kudos!  (note - that was totally sincere)<p>At first I thought you were leaving out their smarts and technology, but speed and agility were because of the smarts and tech.

99419,comment,99218,99335,0,0,hollerith,,,"Agreed that the ACM's Digital Library is a total waste of a person's time and always has been.  Practically every important paper in physics and astronomy is available from a central location (arxiv.org) without restriction and with two clicks (one to specify the paper, the second to choose between PDF, Postscript, Latex source code, etc), and it is only a matter of time before computer science is the same way.",1200514841
99418,comment,99351,99351,0,0,eVizitei,,,"After searching for correlating articles, I believe that this article jumped the gun.  It's cool to speculate on what would happen if we made contact with an alien civilization, but it appears this is premature for the particular signal they're talking about.

99417,comment,99351,99371,0,0,jfoutz,,,"That's a pretty human-centric view of the universe. The thing about aliens is, they're alien. Maybe they regulate self replication, therefore the humans need to be licensed. Maybe they can't handle the concept of not being alone, like Kricket. No way to know up front.<p>I'd like to say we have things, therefore humans are slightly more likely to build stuff than destroy stuff. I'd hope civilization works that way everywhere, but there is no proof of that. Really, there isn't all that much evidence.<p>We'd share physics and math, and that's about it.<p>However, this particular article is nonsense.",1200514578

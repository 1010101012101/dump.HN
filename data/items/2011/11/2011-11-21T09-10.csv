The reducibility of society to the individual is a feature of <i>liberalism</i> - indeed, it's probably the defining characteristic. Once we try to make a collective a unit of polity, we run into trouble.<p>Smith's math was - for every dollar in profit ""p"" you make, you create  ""x"" dollars of consumer surplus, and ""x"" is always much more than ""p"" ( because people simply would not bother. The ""unconscious"" nature of consumer surplus, and the clear historical disasters wrought by large efforts based on intentions show clearly that we need discipline in our evaluation of what we do that does good. One was of doing that is price and profit.<p>There are the Adam Curtis films, in which he tries to use neocon logic to critique liberalism without being the sort of neocon one can spit on, but his films are problemsome. He at least asks the right questions, which are hard questions, and you can't blame him for being responsible enough to provide at least one answer.<p>Profit is little more than a ""qsort callback"" related to priority. it is a tool for the always difficult question of ""what shall we do now?"" There are certainly forms of gain which entail rent-seeking or despoilment which are called profit ( but are not, really - there are either economic rents or involve the creation of negative externalities ) but beyond that, Smith's read really is that of a moral philosopher first, and I've yet to see a really good counter to it that does not involve something akin to universe-building.",1321869265

3260559,comment,3260203,3260481,6,0,d_r,,,"Thanks for the reply. Definitely interesting to hear what it is like on the ""other side"" of the drawing board.<p>Android is actually an interesting case. Android applications <i>are</i> sandboxed. It's just that applications can request some very dubious permissions (""read all your SMS messages"") and users don't know any better and don't read the fine print. The flexibility does allow for some excellent customizations (e.g. Swype keyboard replacement), but the risk of shenanigans is also there.<p>TechCrunch says:<p><pre><code>    One of the most popular forms of trickery in Q3 was
    SMS-sending Trojans that collect personal information
    and steal money. Another new method of stealing user
    information is malware that records phone conversations
    and forwards them to the attacker.
</code></pre>
These are not classic viruses in the purest sense. These are not, say, buffer overrun exploits. These originate from apps the user downloaded that do other, sneaky things.<p>How do you protect the user from the user? The other flip side is iOS where almost everything is heavily locked down, except perhaps for the AddressBook API. The user is not very trusted, and essentially has no way of opting-in to anything really dangerous. This does severely limit the interesting cross-app interaction cases. But I can sleep safely knowing that my iPhone-holding non-techie family members can't download anything that would cause harm.<p>Since educating users across the board is likely impossible, does this mean the tough Apple approach is the way of the future (loosely speaking)?",1321868495

The USDA is using it for a couple of huge enterprise applications, for example.<p>Hobo is not an admin interface.   It basically is a system to enable smart re-use of components that's tightly integrated into your entire stack.<p>For instance, in Hobo you can type  `<input/>` and Hobo will do the right thing automatically: plop down a text input if the current context is a string, a fully filled out select box if it's a belongs_to or a datepicker if it's a date.  The name and default value of that input will also be automatically and correctly inserted.<p>Change the definition of `<input for=""Date""/>` and you can change the options on your datepicker or switch datepickers everywhere or just on that page or that section.<p>Beginners love Hobo because they can get an app up quick.

3260541,comment,3259713,3260102,3,0,roel_v,,,"What she's arguing for, and this is no secret in Brussels and even -dare I say- common sense, is better <i>enforcement</i> of copyright. The problem isn't with copyright itself, it's with the difficulties that those who want to use it to monetize content encounter when it comes to making sure people abide by it. Working DRM is impossible with current technology, I think everybody reading this agrees with that; so there are two ways forward: change technology so that it becomes prohibitively difficult for the average customer to copy content without a rights holder's consent, of a whole different business model all together that separates payment from copying. Both are very hard problems for which there are no real solutions in sight. In the short and medium term, the only realistic trend I see is a more active stance from the rights holders themselves in defending those rights - i.e. more lawsuits, without government involvement. (Criminal law is not the right tool for this issue anyway, it's a shame that we've wasted 15 years on going down that route now).",1321867626

This is almost certainly the case and even if it isn't at this second it will be.  How can we assume the people ""dispelling rumors"" even know the truth?",1321866594

See [1] for an example of how to use pyjs with mediagenerator.<p>You should be prepared for lots of subtle pyjs bugs, though. The translation isn't perfect. One problem is that the Pyjamas team is replicating GWT, so they only need a small subset of Python's features. They also don't use more advanced features for performance reasons. This means that many code paths are practically untested.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/blog/django/2010/11/Offline-HTML5-canvas-app-in-Python-with-django-mediagenerator-Part-1-pyjs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/blog/django/2010/11/Offline...</a>",1321866286

(Compromised websites were all set to be a strong third source, but Wordpress cleaned up its act and we haven't seen as much of that this year.)<p>AB+ takes care of the ads, which seems to be the biggest source of infections. Chrome seems to be pretty resilient to direct attacks against the browser so far, if statements from people at CanSecWest are anything to go by. (With at least one known exception [1].)<p>We make guesses about the source of the infection based on the type of infection, what we find in which temp folders, and the client's browsing history -- if they're OK with us looking into that.<p>edit: I should explain that we've seen the same results from Firefox w/ AB+.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-pick/googles-chrome-browser-has-finally-been-hacked-2011059/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-pick/googles-chrome-browse...</a>",1321866272

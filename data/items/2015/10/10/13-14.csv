Ok but you seem apprehensive about it.  Why are you apprehensive? It&#x27;s going to be expensive? We have a trade deficit with Mexico.

The rest is trivial.<p>However, using <i></i>someone else<i></i> vim is completely different!<p>You must keep in mind that vim is much similar to a programming language. You can remap keys all over the place. You can create exotic combinations that do wonderful and/or terrible things with few key strokes. You can install plugins that argument and alter vim behaviours.<p>Jumping into a well tuned vim setup is not unsimilar to starting to use a new programming framework.

Many of my friends in tech do have Twitter accounts, of which they make varying degrees of use (though I&#x27;m not sure how many of them would regard it as essential - probably not many).<p>Most of my non-tech friends in real life broadly do not have Twitter accounts, or if they do, they follow about eight people (usually including Stephen Fry) and have either never tweeted, or only tweeted about four times, usually starting with, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m on Twitter now. What do I do next?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m talking about people in their 20s and 30s here.

The younger generation definitely do use Snapchat and the like, but I think most people over about 25 have no understanding at all of it.

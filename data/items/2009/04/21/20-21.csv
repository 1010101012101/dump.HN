This is the more expensive cert, maybe $400 or more.  They make sure you have a D&B number, and ideally do a bit of auditing to be sure that you are legit.<p>So if you are one of those companies and you can make money just for selling a cert, and without having to do any sort of audit, why wouldn't you?  With such a basic cert you are mostly just allowing users to have ssl transport without an annoying browser message.  That is worth something.<p>There are even cheaper ones that use a second cert which I think is just a basic part of SSL.

572953,comment,572730,572730,0,0,briansmith,,,"This is at least partially a reaction to the Linux community's tricks to get fonts. Some people in the Linux community wrote a program to automatically download and install Microsoft's TrueType Font Collection fonts after installation. That way, Linux can use all the fonts that Microsoft spent millions of dollars designing, Linux itself isn't affected by the fonts' license, nobody in the Linux community has to spend resources to design decent fonts, and the user isn't hassled much.<p>All the font foundries saw that and said ""we will never allow that to happen again""--especially since the intersection between their customers and Linux users is nearly the empty set. Their proposed solution is to allow embedding only if the font files on the servers are covered by the DMCA. That is why there is a trivial obsfucation of the font information in the EOT specification. If somebody distributes a program to scrape a bunch of fonts of the web and install them onto a person's computer, they can use the DMCA to take the program down (just as the movie industry did with DeCSS). It isn't 100% effective, but it <i>does</i> help prevent casual piracy. The copy-protection bits of EOT are a lost cause in the long run. But, they will be somewhat effective in the short run. That is just like DeCSS--the first couple of years, it was difficult for an inexperienced user to find a trustworthy DeCSS program with a usable interface.<p>I support EOT because Microsoft already made it the de-facto standard in 1997, and Microsoft already said they won't implement TTF linking in IE. That means that if other browsers don't implement EOT, we will always have the hassle of having separate font files for IE and other browsers. That is silly. It is the other browsers' fault that they have been so lethargic to implement font linking. Now, 12 years later they finally implement it, but in an incompatible way. Then they turn around and blame Microsoft for having a 12-year-old implementation that is incompatible with their nubile mechanism. Who wins at that game?

I started ""thinking in sets"" and found that I was much more effective.  SQL got more work done in fewer lines of code in a simple way than hooking up my J2EE java junk via JDBC in more traditional programming.  But it took the direct use of SQL for a couple of years before the experience pushed my coding to the next level.  Much of this benefit was due to the fact that the apps I worked on were really data driven and ""fit"" the relational data model well, coupled with the fact that I was in a role that allowed me to do architecture design and low level implementation.  And tear the design and implementation apart to do it again after finding all the nuances in the app and data.<p>The switch from imperative programming languages to a declarative programming language to take advantage of SQL has made me curious about Lisp and functional programming.  I have an idea for a web app and I’ll use it as a vehicle to test out Lisp.  Worst case, I pick up a language that purports to have almost mystical powers (all hail the mighty macro).  Best case, a nice startup could grow out of the project.  But the real point is to get real hands-on experience with a more powerful language than the standard C, Java, Perl, and SQL stuff I’ve already done.  Plus, I’d hate to miss out on some key part of a hacker’s personal growth over that 10 year march . . .<p>That’s a lot of background to get to two simple questions.<p>Do any of the HN readers have any tips or advice on speeding up the transition to ""thinking in Lisp""?  I’ll probably be hacking away using Practical Common Lisp and On Lisp as my guides (SICP is probably somewhere in the mix).   Have any of you followed a similar path as you head towards a decade of hacking and did the Lisp (or other fp language) dance grow your skills in a big way (ie, now I’m a faster developer in general or better algorithm designer or communicator of code ideas)?

9365891,comment,9365198,9365623,0,0,pookieinc,,,"I agree with this post, but not with regards to the Kindle, but more Amazon as an entity.<p>Also, perfect timing to read this article, after just purchasing a Kindle Paperwhite and having it for a few weeks now.<p>As a casual reader, I find the Kindle Paperwhite as the perfect medium for my reading needs. I can hold it in one hand, I can read it any time of the day with adjustable brightness, and the e-ink is very clear and the font is fine. With respect to the article, I don&#x27;t think the typical person cares much for typography, as long as it can be read and understood. The justification notion, I would argue that the typical user may not notice it as much as the hardcore reader. This is where I disagree with the parent post here, as in Amazon may understand &quot;the customer&quot; in this particular case, or at least the majority. Everyone who I&#x27;ve come across absolutely loves, and heavily uses, their Kindle(s). Some people even collect them! All reviews love them and it&#x27;s a great experience.<p>The point of the article: Now, I&#x27;m all for making the Kindle the best reading device ever by adding all these cool features (justification, typography, different modes for different things like iBooks, etc.), but instead of targeting the Kindle as being deficient for most users, the article is targeting Amazon more so for it&#x27;s lack of pushing the product to all it can be and I think this can be extracted toward larger companies doing what they can to push the envelope with their product. This is where I agree with the parent post, Amazon seems to be lacking in this area. The blogpost written and the parent post both point to deficiencies in how Amazon looks to their customers and pushes their products to the best they can be.",1428897576

And that the article does address—it&#x27;s used as a metaphor for things that are pretty and peaceful on the surface, but which hide unpleasant details and histories:<p>Some excerpts:<p>> What are those pressing concerns, though, and what are the sources of this unsettlement? Clearly, the recent rise of the eerie coincides with a phase of severe environmental damage.<p>> Digging down to reveal the hidden content of the under-earth is another trope of the eerie: what is discovered is almost always a version of capital.<p>> Contemporary eerie culture is also drawn to the military and security infrastructure that occupies much of England’s land and air space, from Salisbury Plain to Otterburn to Foulness. This dispersed geography of conflict and surveillance has attracted the interests of ...<p>> Yet state surveillance is no longer testified to in the landscape by giant edifices. Instead it is mostly carried out in by software programs running on computers housed in ordinary-looking government buildings, its sources and effects – like all eerie phenomena – glimpsed but never confronted.<p>etc, etc.",1428897504

And I say that as someone who daily uses two languages that can&#x27;t be represented in USASCII.<p>The specific case described by the article was parsing internet protocol data for, say, SMTP or HTTP etc.  It&#x27;s best to consider it a special kind of binary protocol that some people can read directly.  One artifact of these protocols is that they are case-insensitive.<p>You can&#x27;t use this trick on user data (which includes domain names these days) and the author doesn&#x27;t say you should.  But for example if you&#x27;re parsing the response to an EHLO it should be perfectly fine to parse it this way.<p>Yes, it happens to be in English, but so what?

I&#x27;ve already started on my goal to be a healthy weight and have my blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol under control without medication by the end of the year. First step: Halve my caloric intake, not by starving myself but simply by reducing portion sizes.

Step two is walking at least a mile a day, gradually upgrading that to 2 miles, then jogging 2 miles a day once I&#x27;ve dropped enough weight that my knees won&#x27;t suffer.<p>If I make it to my weight and health goals by the end of the year, I&#x27;ll start working on building up some muscle to help keep the fat at bay at my sedentary job.

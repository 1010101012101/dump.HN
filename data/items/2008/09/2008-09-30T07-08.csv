319403,comment,318737,318951,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>Where is Saudi Arabia?</i><p>Saudi is most definitely an outlier. But that is to be expected. They are an unusual case. They are a physical religious hub (like Rome but more) because of the Haj & other reasons. And they did not reach current GDP levels by conventional means.<p><i>And where does Israel fall?</i><p>I think you might be surprised. Both Judaism & Islam are relatively easy to gauge because of the lifestyle demands they make. Most Jews considered 'religious' would probably observe, kosher (what you can eat), Sabath (No driving, electricity on Saturday), attend synagogue weekly, pray daily, etc. The percentage of Jews that adhere to these is probably around the 20% - 30%. A further 20% - 30% probably adhere to some of these. Not sure about Muslim population. Both are probably becoming more religious over time. Anyway, I think at 25k GDP pp, you could place it above the line, but not too far.<p>The correlation within Israel, probably works.",1222760886
319402,comment,319337,319337,0,0,sb,,,"though this is a nice project in itself--and i don't want, and neither intend to, to insult anybody, i think that this implementation is not actually well suited for anybody new 
to compilers to understand what's going on.<p>AFAICT, newcomers are much better off learning the art of simplicity w.r.t. compilers from niklaus wirth's book on compiler construction (the pdf can be downloaded from his homepage); it is an easy read, and pascal is also a worthwhile language to learn (IMHO, i sure did in the mid-90s and it was no waste of time). there is also much benefit in knowing the tools of the trade if you have to design something other than a simple language, i.e. knowing bison/yacc/cup/antlr/burg etc. is definitiely a plus.
finally, the traditional top-down-approach is also very useful if you're designing, say a DSL, yourself -- it can still be interpreted within the language of your choice (i.e. ruby, perl, python have all nice parser generators for that task) -- no need to directly get to ""shores of hell"" (again so mid-90s ;), ahem, code generation...",1222760878

I think in large part the problem with Windows Mobile phones is the driver quality/integration -- a problem that you can't separate from the hardware too far.<p><i>No one else makes a legitimate phone OS with all this support that can be tweaked down to the very roots. For one thing, I'm excited to be able to download an entirely different version of all of Android’s core applications if I don't like the default 1.0 versions—and that’s every app, everything from the dialer to the contacts manager—something that's technically possible in WinMo but often comes off more as an awkward re-skinning and not a top-down integration.</i><p>I know the good folks at Google have given this a lot of hard thought, but the fit and finish of those applications is critical to the reliability of the phone as a phone. Software that hook into those interfaces poorly or without good reason risks a lot of reliability for dubious gain. Anyone who used Mac OS pre-X or PalmOS with a lot of extensions knows exactly what I'm talking about.<p>That said, I'm more and more pumped about it as time goes on. The openness can't hurt, even if Apple isn't on board (and likely won't be for years if ever).",1222759762

If I were in The States, Obama's beliefs wouldn't worry me. Palin's might. In the very theoretical sense, they both worry me a little.

319378,comment,318737,319263,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>""The distinction is between people who, in that area of conflict, tend to give precedence to either belief or science.""</i><p>I think you're wrong here. I think few <i>give precedence</i> to science. They find a way to work around the conflict. Giving precedence is along the lines of 'I see a green sheep so I know they exist' taking precedence over 'I read on wikipedia that all sheep are white.'Generally, the latter set of believers interpret 'wikipedia' in a way that does not cause conflict or minimises conflict.<p>Obviously there is a practical distinction between various points on the scale between Obama & Bin laden (with Palin somewhere in between). But the scale is not about how they deal with 'conflict.' It's about how often the conflicts occur & where. That's the practical scale that affects what people do & how they vote.<p>On the more fundamental scale of how they deal with such conflict, the variations tend to be much smaller.<p>Edit: Clarification",1222758855

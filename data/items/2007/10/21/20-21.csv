70954,comment,70855,70943,0,0,qaexl,,,"Or maybe in the rush to imitate the Western styles, the Japanese at the time discarded their traditional arts. Until they gained experience in that new style, they could hardly create visually integrative designs. They obviously were able to create visually integrative designs when they weren't trying to imitate someone else.<p>I don't think the use of a visual language impairs that part of the mind as much as you seem to think it does.",1193000000

Life isn't always fair (not in the way that you want it to be, anyway).<p>Make it more extreme:  if you got rejected to a grad school, but Don Knuth called the chair of the admissions committee and <i>insisted</i> that you -- based on his intimate knowledge of your skills and talent -- were the perfect student for their school, wouldn't they be <i>idiots</i> to ignore him?<p>I don't want to preach at you, but if you're really disturbed by this small bit of favoritism, you're going to have a really tough time as you go through life.  The smart thing to do here is not to protest, but to take note of the phenomenon, and do your best to <i>exploit</i> it to your advantage.  Otherwise, you're just pissing in the wind.<p>(You can be as fair as you want when you run the show.)",1192999367

70943,comment,70855,70907,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I wouldn't call it native bias, but it may be an error of adjacency instead of causality.  While living in Japan (in the early 90's) it was very common to hear from Japanese that their mode of operation was to copy and then improve on the copy rather than to make any great new discoveries.  Also, at the time I was there, the educational system enforced strict conformity - common saying ""if you see a nail sticking out, you hammer it down.""<p>In any case, I was there as an architect, and I was amazed at how the building designs there, which were typically very strange attempts at copying other styles, were horribly integrated.  Sure, each part of the building was executed beautifully, but the whole was horrible.  I was among many foreign architects broght in to improve on the local design talent there.  This is primarily where my observation of lack of integrative ability/innovation comes form - the built forms .<p>For the kanji discussion, even though there are many idiosyncracies about pronunciation in spelling for English and other languages, you can get pretty far phonetically. With Japanese/Chinese, you can't get far at all without learning so many separate images (except for the few words using phonetic alphabets.)<p>As far as innovation, Toyota has revolutionized business processes with their lean system, but their car designs (the look) when they are good, are most likely done out of country.  (Many car design exteriors come out of California, including the  look of the Porsche Cayman and Boxter, etc)<p>I'm seeing a pattern in my post here: maybe the memorization of all those images makes it more difficult (but certainly not impossible of course) for the language user to create visually integrative designs?",1192998410

Randy Pausch claims to have been admitted to CMU because he knew someone powerful who could vouch for him, and that's actually quite common.  Most graduate admission committees consider a glowing recommendation from a successful researcher to be far more important than a standardized test result.<p>You can argue that this system was/is unfair, but most people would argue that the outcome is still a good one;  after all, Randy Pausch is an extremely successful researcher.",1192998027

My plan is to use VMWare and LAMP environment for the server-side because of scaling and licensing issues.<p>\nI'm a MS geek, though. Where's a good resource to get started with something like this? All I want to do is to connect to MySQL from a windows client, set up the IP of the box, and copy some files over to the proper directory for them to appear on the web. Seems like that shouldn't be a lot to do. Hey -- how hard could it be, anyway?",1192997260
70938,comment,70855,70871,0,0,cglee,,,"Chinese and Japanese are constructed via ""strokes"", which build into simple characters (like letters, if you will), which then constitute more sophisticated characters.  Chinese characters are not pictograms, in the sense that every character is distinctly unique. <p>Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding, but you seem to imply that Chinese and Japanese do not innovate or integrate ideas as well as Westerners?  If so, this observation seems to contradict reality.",1192997149

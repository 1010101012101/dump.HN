(Quite a complement, for any author!)<p>TF is a really eloquent distillation of what Forth has taught the author about keeping programs maintainable, well-organized, and concise. Most of its techniques (often called ""factoring"") are applicable in almost any language, and it often reads like a predecessor to Martin Fowler's _Refactoring_. (The ideas spread from the Forth community to Smalltalkers over the fifteen years between the two.)",1217594267

Only one is needed for great software. See also: Linus Torvalds' emails ;-)<p>p.s. As <i>I</i> read the OP, this was about a situation where editing the original actually changed the desired behaviour. So the example I would have chosen would be that a code reviewer, instead of firing back a question about the one-liner, changes it without any discussion. And breaks the application. Whereas you seem to be discussing a hypothetical case where changing something from one to six lines has no effect on the resulting functionality.",1217593116

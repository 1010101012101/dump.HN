This way Egison can do more complicated kinds of pattern matching such as matching patterns against graphs or other complicated data structures. I don&#x27;t see why any of these features could not be added to an existing Lisp. OTOH, it might not be about adding more features, it might be about doing it efficiently.

Native C code compiled with NDK is used all over Android core and it&#x27;s used regularly in apps to provide speed boosts. But it has practically no access to Android APIs (with exception of OpenGL/OpenAL some sensors and bitmap functions) so it&#x27;s totally unsuited for development of a full app in C or C++. It&#x27;s role is pretty much the same as C code in python libraries - to provide boosts for performance critical code.<p>Taking that into account, I really have no idea who acts like &quot;NDK doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;.

The testcases in one compiler&#x27;s regressions suites are usually reduced to the shortest program that causes a previous bug, and another compiler that does not share any source code with the first one will have no particular reason to contain bugs that are revealed by the same programs.

7925116,comment,7924441,7924752,1,0,HillOBeans,,,"I&#x27;ve been trying to sit this one out, but I&#x27;ve got to be blunt with YOU: how can anyone with a &quot;sufficient understanding of the philosophy of science&quot; draw the conclusion that evolution works?! Simply put, the scientific process is supposed to be: observe -> hypothesize -> test -> revise. If life is supposed to have arisen by purely natural processes, then the information-building, error-checking and correcting code system that is our DNA must have somehow constructed itself. I am not aware of any experiments following the scientific process that have demonstrated that such a thing is even remotely possible. Instead you have a bunch of &quot;just so&quot; stories about the distant past that are untestable ancient history that we are supposed to believe because we are told to do so by &quot;people who are smarter than you&quot;. Smacks more of religion than &quot;science&quot; to me. And don&#x27;t tell me about any experiments that demonstrate rapid speciation as evidence of evolution - that is NOT the same thing and is an equivocation I see proponents of evolution use all the time. They are instead examples of genetic isolation and information LOSS and are incapable of generating more complex, &quot;higher&quot; organisms. It is for this reason that some scientists have adopted the idea of intelligent design: information can only be created by an intelligent designer. I would expect a forum populated by people who write code to see that. I think that the idea of even a simple computer being able to construct AND program itself would be preposterous to most people here. And yet that is what the GTE proposes. Perhaps that points too much in the direction of a god for some people to accept, but the evidence seems to be clearly on the side of ID, IF you are truly following a &quot;scientific&quot; process.",1403362274
7925115,comment,7924582,7924582,8,0,toolslive,,,"I want to comment on one quote from the article:\n&quot;&quot;&quot;It&#x27;s impossible to be &quot;as fast as C&quot; in all cases while remaining safe&quot;&quot;&quot;.<p>C is not that fast. One of the major problems is that it&#x27;s close to hardware. 1970s hardware that is. Ken Thompson reportedly once said: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do nibbles. I have an 8 bit processor&quot;.<p>A good example of how bad it has become is that modern processors have a rather good understanding of the &#x27;string&#x27; concept, and offer instructions to process them. C offers a char*.<p>Another problem is that C has strict contracts on how parameters are to be passed through, and combined with separate compilation units, this hurts compilers when they try to optimize things.<p>I see greater potential for a safe higher level language to be able to align closer to modern day hardware than C. Some nice examples: Linear types can avoid garbage altogether, and coroutines can be expressed clearly and correctly using monads.\nOn the other hand, raw performance is rarely needed, and most cycles are burned interpreting things like python and php.",1403362252

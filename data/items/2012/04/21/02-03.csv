However, The homepage seems to be a little sparse in terms of specifics. Before implementing this as a core part of a product, I'd like to know:<p>- Pricing model?<p>- Seems free for now, but how about when it's out of beta? How are you going to ensure you stay alive without making me go out of business?<p>- How does this work? ""Magic scalability"" is mentioned, which sets a red flag for me. We process >1B requests a month (and growing), and we've found that even the best tools have to be used carefully. Black box software such as this is very scary.<p>- How is this deployed? Is it on EC2, which would mean low latency between our infrastructure and the bridge servers? Is there an installable version for people who aren't on EC2? Seems to be a requirement, since message / queues and internal apis require low latency to process things quickly. Especially if we're basing our entire internal service-oriented architecture on top of it.<p>I want to love this, but there's a lot of unanswered questions, at least from perusing this site.

3870628,comment,3868970,3869164,1,0,stcredzero,,,"Different definition of ""player?"" I don't think mruby is meant to compete with MRI. JRuby is said by many to be a fork, and I would understand it to be a competitor, but I don't think their intentional focus is forking the language. The same goes for Rubinius. I didn't think of MacRuby to be a language fork. IronRuby isn't a player.<p>MRI, JRuby, and Rubinius were or are running significant populations of web apps. I wasn't aware that MacRuby was widely used for other than building apps on OS X.<p>Contrast this with Smalltalk, which at one point simultaneously had VisualWorks, Smalltalk Agents, Digitalk VSE (merged with other vendor), Smalltalk MT, IBM VisualAge Smalltalk, ObjectStudio, Smalltalk/X, Dolphin Smalltalk, and Squeak, all of which were actively being used to build or maintain desktop apps, and all but two of which were running on Windows. On top of that, there were significant semantic and syntactic differences between all of them, which make the differences between Ruby implementations seem quite minor. (Really messy and fundamental differences like namespaces and what does one expect Dictionaries to return when you insert something?)<p>Back in 1999 or so, most of the Smalltalk implementations were commercial, and many of the companies had no incentive to interoperate and some incentive not to. In contrast, I think there's more incentive to interoperate and avoid language forks for the Ruby community.<p>Also, if one considers the population of Smalltalk devs back then compared to Ruby devs today, then no, I wouldn't say anomalously many per capita. BASIC and Forth seem to be in a different league for number of implementations. One would have to do some digging, but it might be argued that Ruby has relatively few implementations even for its relative age.",1334974337

To me, a well designed interface is one that invites you to play with it and learn its ins and outs, while making the experience memorable so that you'll find your way more easily in the future. It's best for the interface to be informative while doing this, but if you spray text all over everything, it does impede exploration.",1334974251

I can remember when I first started reading there were a lot of things that just weren't intuitive to me. I always wondered why a site for ""hackers"" and ""coders"" seemed so basic in features and looked like something from the 90's. Particularly, the login and password reset seems kind of difficult to use. Is there no RSS feed? How do I know when someone replies to one of my comments? Looking at my profile I have no idea what that stuff is for... ""Max visits"" ""minaway"" ""delay""... ?? I still don't know what that is. I get the speed and simplicity idea but I think there are some user experience issues that can be solved while still having speed and simplicity.<p>Maybe I'm the only that feels this way, but just my thoughts.

It's an integral part of UX, but only when considered <i>within the framework</i> of UX. The points value is now shaded in 3D: Why?  The rank is now an orange circle: How does this help the user?<p>The best visual design is always based on UX. Do users consult the rank often? If not, the orange should be reserved for something else more demanding of the user's attention. Are the point totals interactive? If not, the 3D shading should be saved for use as an affordance somewhere where there is interaction.

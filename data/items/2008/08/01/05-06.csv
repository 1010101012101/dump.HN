I punch out such a cracking piece of code that Guido himself wept on his first reading. A hapless QA engineer rewrites my punchline, a lambda compressing not less than six lines into one, back into a six line function.  (As to whether Guido would in fact weep at such code is topic for another discussion).<p>I fire off an invective harangue to the QA manager. He posts it on the intranet.<p>The other grey beards nod in agreement: ""Fucking QA engineers"", they mutter, ""'bout time someone showed 'em!""<p>Meanwhile the rest of the company thinks I'm a pompous, sanctimonious twat. With a single missive I've repositioned myself from wronged to wrongdoer. And perhaps simultaneously emboldened the stupid wretch.<p>Never underestimate the didactic value of a discreet word. (This is, mind you, a one time offer: Next time said QA engineer gets it in the neck.)<p><i>Let me add that I love Giles and have immeasurable respect for him as a writer and critic. He is easily the best fuckin' part of the fuckin' F-Word: He just over-cooked this one.</i>",1217569983

263797,comment,263711,263711,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think the rant about the check-in kiosk is somewhat off base.  They ask you for your destination as a ""security measure"", because anyone can make a magnetic card that has anyone's name on it, and then say they forgot their ID at security.  This makes stealing someone else's ticket slightly more difficult, although not all that hard, I guess.<p>It also would have helped if he input the correct airport code for San Fransisco instead of just making something up.  It's SFO, not SAN.<p>The rest of the article has the right idea.  Installers shouldn't ask questions.  Let the user change preferences later, just pick some defaults and get the thing going.  The problem is that there are too many meetings inside software development companies, and every idea is a good idea if it comes up in a meeting.",1217569755

263795,comment,263626,263666,0,0,ardit33,,,"""Those that don't like the terms don't have to get cell phones""  -- Well, cellphones operate in public space.  There is limited amount of spectrum available, and the companies that decide to use it, must obey to certain rules.  If these companies don't like the terms, they don't have to use the spectrum.<p>I'd like the goverment to get involved more into allowing fair access to devices, and allowing third party aplications to be installed in devices, without the need of the ""blessing"" of the carriers.<p>Imagine, if every piece of software you installed in your computer, have to be ""aproved"" by your ISP.   \nWell, that's how it is the current state in the mobile world, and that's why there is a lack of real inovation there.<p>There is no limit to the amount of greed.  In this case, there is clear tacit collusion between carriers, as all of them seem to have early termination fees.<p>When you have few players in a market (restricted by the limited amount of spectrum), there is a great chance that free market rules wont apply anymore, and just saying the goverment should not get involved, is a way to say let the companies rape the customer as much as possible.<p>ETF do actually hamper inovation on the device space.  All cellphones have to be bought and aproved by the carrier (who resell them at discounted rates), while hampering the adoption of inovative devices.  Everytime you pick a verizon phone, and look at the ugly UI the carrier forced the device makers to use, you know the market is not working right.<p>THe problem, is that the customer is still getting raped.  You end up paying higher monthly fees for voice/data/sms messaging, to make up for that device subsidy, yet the customer has less choices on the devices they use.<p>Look at Europe.  They have much more rules in the wireless space to protect the customer, yet usage and the industry is booming there.  A lot of inovation going on there  (even the SMS was invented in Europe, not here).",1217569552

Plus it gives you a chance to understand what your customers want, which is crucial to early development in an application.

Accordingly he pampers his victim into morbid and unnatural fatness; and, when it is in such a state that it would be sent away in disgust from any table, he offers it to the judges. The object of the poetical candidate, in like manner, is to produce, not a good poem, but a poem of that exact degree of frigidity or bombast which may appear to his censors to be correct or sublime.

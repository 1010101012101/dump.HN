Part of that can be mitigated with the things I outline in the post.  But I think more than anything finding that one key predictor of success is important.  For Viximo it was sites that had high DAU/MAU ratio.  We&#x27;d rather take a company with 1/10 of the total audience, a crappier experience, and worse business terms but a high DAU/MAU ratio.

(By &quot;break&quot; I mean the text runs off the right side of the screen or overflows into other elements.)  But then there is no way to work around the breakage without tediously going back into preferences or about:config, lowering the minimum font size, then raising it again when I am done with the problematic site.<p>In other words, the reason I do not set a minimum font size is that Firefox treats the minimum font size as a hard limit to be observed even when the user explicitly asks to reduce the size of the text (which, again, I would need to do whenever the site does not render sanely at my preferred font size).<p>So I find myself increasing the size of the text many, many times a day.  At least recent versions of Firefox allow me to add to the navigation toolbar a &quot;[-|+]&quot; widget that lets me increment or decrement the size with one click.  Also, Firefox often remembers the text size for the next time I visit the same site.<p>Hope that answers your question.<p>I seem to recall a few sites&#x27; breaking (becoming difficult to navigate or fathom) if the text size is even slightly larger than the default size set by the site, so I am curious as to why you do not have that problem.

6330434,comment,6329619,6329619,12,0,astral303,,,"Cassandra counters once were implemented as a blazing-fast vector-clock patch [1,2] that did not involve read-before-write on update. The biggest (IMO) downside is that it did not support decrements. So Cassandra tech leadership decided [2] to implement counters as &quot;read, increment, write.&quot; However, that came with two major downsides: 1) counter updates were now no longer replayable--so if you experience an update timeout on the Cassandra side under heavy load or due to a lengthy compaction or some network fluke, you just can&#x27;t replay it. You need to hope that it has made it over. Counters run on hope. But you can decrement them now. 2) read-before-write can severely limit performance in the case of a large number of counter writes (as the workload becomes much more read-intensive, unlike regular blazing-fast Cassandra writes).<p>1 - <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-580"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-580</a>\n2 - <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-1072"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-1072</a><p>However, in many many a use case for counters, you just don&#x27;t need to decrement. And if you need to decrement, you can often get away with two counters, that you subtract from each other.

We realized there were many business owners out there who struggled with the various template sites (Wordpress, Wix, Web.com) but didn&#x27;t have thousands to spend on custom development.<p>So we created a simple $99/month package which included everything clients needed (design, updates, and hosting) via Squarespace.

6330426,comment,6329041,6329424,20,0,haberman,,,"Just to give a bit of counterpoint, here are some trade-offs that Capn Proto makes compared with protobufs.  (Full disclosure: I work at Google and know Kenton from his time here; I have my own protobuf library that I&#x27;ve worked on for several years). I&#x27;m sure Kenton will correct me if I get anything wrong. :)<p>Capn Proto&#x27;s key design characteristic is to use the same encoding on-the-wire as in-memory.  Protobufs have a wire format that looks something like:<p><pre><code>  [field number 3][value for field 3]\n  [field number 7][value for field 7]\n  etc.\n</code></pre>\nThe fieldnum/value pairs can come in any order, and may define as many or as few of the declared fields as are present.  This serialization format doesn&#x27;t work for in-memory usage because for general programming you need O(1) access to each value, so protobufs have a &quot;parse&quot; step that unpacks this into a C++ class where each field has its own member.<p>Protobufs are heavily optimized so this parsing is fast, but it&#x27;s still a very noticeable cost in high-volume systems.  So Capn Proto defines its wire format such that it <i>also</i> has O(1) access to arbitrary fields.  This makes it suitable as an in-memory format also.<p>While this avoids a parsing step, it also means that your wire format has to preserve the empty spaces for fields that aren&#x27;t present.  So to get the &quot;infinitely faster&quot; advantage, you have to accept this cost.  For dense messages, this can actually be smaller than the comparable protobuf because you don&#x27;t have to encode the field numbers.  But for very sparse messages, this can be arbitrarily larger.<p>As Kenton points out on <a href=""http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/encoding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/encoding.html</a> , lots of zeros compress really well, so even sparse messages can become really small by compressing them.  To do this you lose &quot;infinitely faster&quot;, but according to Kenton this is still faster than protobufs.<p>In both cases though, the tight coupling between the (uncompressed) wire format and the in-memory format imposes certain things on your application with regards to memory management and the mutation patterns the struct will allow. For example, it appears that the in-memory format was not sufficiently flexible for Python to wrap it directly, so the Python extension does in fact have a parse step.<p>Other cases where you could need a parse/serialize step anyway: if you want to put the wire data into a specialized container like a map or set (or your own custom data classes), or if the supported built-in mutation patterns are not flexible enough for you (for example, the Capn Proto &quot;List&quot; type appears to have limitations on how and when a list can grow in size).<p>It&#x27;s very cool work, but I don&#x27;t believe it obsoletes Protocol Buffers.  I&#x27;m actually interested in making the two interoperate, along with JSON -- these key/value technologies are so similar in concept and usage that I think it&#x27;s unfortunate they don&#x27;t interoperate better.",1378328170

You&#x27;re right that no one in this thread specifically stated that these are brand new ideas, but you can&#x27;t argue that people are stating that it was bad in Android but good in iOS. It all comes back to the user choice vs walled garden argument. There&#x27;s the Android way of doing it, and the Apple way of doing it. You say it&#x27;s a significant difference; the difference is simply in Apple not letting people do something they could do in Android. The parts that overlap are almost exactly the same. Think of how many people believe that the iPod was the first MP3 player, the iPhone was the first smartphone, and the iPad was the first tablet. Do you think that&#x27;s by mistake, or because Apple really wants people to think that? How often on HN do I hear people making the claim that Apple beat Microsoft to the tablet and smartphone game? [1]<p>&quot;On Android can&#x27;t the app just run forever and decide on its own how often to poll the servers? This is a different thing. The OS decides when to schedule things if the app supports it. What may have been true years ago isn&#x27;t necessarily an issue anymore.&quot;<p>vs<p>&quot;When a competitor does it and Apple says they won&#x27;t, it&#x27;s the worst thing in the world. Once the competitor proves its worth and Apple does it, it&#x27;s now the best thing ever&quot;<p>Sure I&#x27;m using hyperbole, but I think I adequately summed up the argument. xutopia implied that Android&#x27;s battery life suffered from having background jobs running, and that this was a bad thing. Since Apple is only letting the jobs run at predefined intervals and all at the same time to save battery life, this is a good thing. That is <i>exactly</i> &quot;it was bad when Android was doing it, and it&#x27;s good when iOS is doing it&quot;. I accept that perhaps he didn&#x27;t know how Android&#x27;s background scheduler works, but that still says to me &quot;background tasks are a bad thing except when Apple does it.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re also conveniently ignoring that I called out just about everyone who had responded at that point, not just xutopia. xutopia&#x27;s comment was the least offensive of all of them, and I certainly understand his argument. Apple is doing it in one of the many correct ways. It&#x27;s <i>not</i>, however, significantly different from how Android recommends developers accomplish the same task. The only difference is, on Android this is discretionary and on iOS this is enforced. Neither of these are bad things.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6264617"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6264617</a><p>This is a discussion I participated in not that long ago where people were legitimately stating that Windows Mobile and Windows tablets don&#x27;t count because the iPhone and Android phones look different and have faster processors.

But with channels you get more flexibility:<p>- you can &quot;block&quot; on many channels at once using the &quot;chanalt&quot; statement. You can &quot;resume&quot; only one lua coroutine at a time.<p>- channels they can buffer messages (ie: channels can queue several values)<p>- many coroutines may &quot;send&quot; a value to a channel at the same time, many coroutines may try to &quot;listen&quot; (receive) a value at the same time.<p>- finally you can pass a channel over a channel<p>I find channels, as opposed to many other synchronization paradigms, to be composable and generally nice in use.<p>It&#x27;s a &quot;better&quot; alternative to synchronization locking and mutable data. But in Lua, of course, there aren&#x27;t multiple threads so why synchronization is useful? In the same way that coroutines are useful - they allow you to decompose a program into set of smaller programs. The example given by Russ Cox is the Eratosthenes sieve.

One of the most difficult things to convey, even to fellow South Koreans, is the fact that North Korea is as complex as any human society. For most people, North Korea is the very definition of the Great Unknown, and we tend to imagine such things as monoliths (it is incredible for instance how many outsiders seem to picture Africa as one giant mass of starvation, disease, and war, and are astonished to see anything that doesn&#x27;t fit the preconception like bustling modern cities with a thriving middle class).<p>It is easy to describe the lack of freedoms, cult of personality, massive prison camps, the <i>songbun</i> caste system and total lack of civil society in North Korea, leaving the curious foreigner shaking her head at the bizarreness and monstrosity of it all. But it is also easy to forget that this is a society inhabited by flesh and blood humans, not ruthless robots and their abstract oppressed victims. We don&#x27;t get to see much of this side of course. But in some ways in the last decade or so North Korea has been creeping towards something close to normalcy, albeit far from idealcorrupt officials, flourishing black markets, extreme disparities in wealth, and even cross-border trade with China. Nothing to portend a Soviet-style collapse of course, but even the slightest increase in openness is something we should welcome.",1378327861

When I said that it was not a possibility for poorly-behaved apps to drain significant amounts of battery under iOS 7, I didn&#x27;t mean that it was absolutely impossible <i>under any and all circumstances including system bugs, unforeseen architectural weaknesses, or gamma ray induced bitflips</i>.

But I&#x27;ll say this, the Christian relationship with money and with power is strange and counterintuitive, and the numbers don&#x27;t generally add up the way a humanist would want them to.  For example, the obvious argument -- that&#x27;s a lot of money, it could be used to help the poor! -- was tried on Jesus once, and didn&#x27;t carry much weight:<p><pre><code>    Matthew 26:6-13\n\n    While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the \n    Leper, a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very \n    expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he \n    was reclining at the table.\n    \n    When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. Why \n    this waste? they asked. This perfume could have been \n    sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.\n    \n    Aware of this, Jesus said to them, Why are you \n    bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to \n    me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will \n    not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my \n    body, she did it to prepare me for burial. Truly I tell \n    you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the \n    world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of \n    her.\n</code></pre>\nFor a more obvious example, take Jesus&#x27; death itself.  His ministry lasted a short three years -- imagine what he could have done, what he could have accomplished, had he lived a full life!  He could have overseen the founding of his church.  Made it as powerful (or not) as he liked.  Taught us so much more.  Healed so many more people.  He gave all of that up, for gains that are . . . suspiciously spiritual in nature.<p>But that&#x27;s God&#x27;s way.  It can seem sideways and backwards sometimes if you don&#x27;t know him, and sometimes even if you do.  He seems more interested in what the process of caring for the poor does to people than in absolute increase in worldwide living standards.  More interested in what being and seeing a martyr does to people than in saving his devoted servants from the flames.  More interested in HOW the problems of this world are overcome -- us AND him, not just one or the other -- than in how fast they are overcome.<p>That doesn&#x27;t excuse expensive cathedrals, but it may help explain why the argument about them isn&#x27;t straightforward.  Things are complicated, and not always what they appear. I know &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot; can be seen as an excuse not to explain <i>anything</i>, but honestly, just the documented ways we already know he&#x27;s worked are much, much weirder than building something beautiful to inspire key people.<p>If that all sounds like sophistry, I can&#x27;t disagree that it kind of is.  I myself am critical of robes and trappings and cathedrals.  It smells a bit too much like materialism for me, just as icons smell a bit too much like idolatry.  I know, Catholics would say it isn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m still suspicious.  I know, God might have his reasons, and he can tell you to do anything he likes, but I still wonder.  Are they acting on words of prophecy, or just habits and best intentions?<p>And then there&#x27;s the issue of appearances.  When the world looks at a $190 million church, do you think they see love for God, a tribute to holiness?  I guarantee you they see greed and pride.  That&#x27;s not something to take lightly.<p>So yeah, I don&#x27;t approve either . . . but it&#x27;s complicated.",1378327218

The idea around a &quot;lean&quot; startup being, that an MVP, or each new feature, or even testing a change to a previous feature is usually done in quick succession. This being testing with current users over a period of say, a week, and then from the results, changes can be made and the team have learned from the testing.<p>So really, Android allows for this quick succession of testing features and iterating as quick as possible, with even to a few hours turnaround. Also, that it would cost a lot in development time to get something &quot;just right&quot; for the App Store for it to be accepted, whereas with Android you can keep on iterating and pushing changes without having to spent a huge amount of time making everything look perfect, and be absolute minimal in terms of bugs.<p>I love iOS development, and yes, I agree with most people on here about the revenue from iOS, the people paying for apps, Apple&#x27;s process of helping keep out most malware etc. etc., but for the sake of a &quot;lean&quot; startup, spending extra weeks testing apps making sure it&#x27;s completely bug free and &quot;looking good enough&quot; for iOS, as well as the wait for Apple to accept the application (and then for users to download the update, in the case of iOS 7, this has been solved), Android is a much better dev option for these changes.<p>Of course, when the team knows that the app is something that people care for, and they have a decent knowledge of what users want, what features they use, and the kind of value that the mobile app brings to them, then they can go ahead and make the best possible iOS app.<p>TL;DR<p>Saving time, money and quick iterations, learning from customers and getting quick data for problem validation, is much easier and faster on Android, than the process on iOS.

Yes, the vast majority of the population has 2 arms, 2 legs, etc. that allow enable clothes manufacturers to follow the same template. But this definitely does not imply that this conclusion is extensible to education.<p>Have you ever worked in a software development company? You&#x27;ve probably noticed that some of your coworkers work better by being isolated and solving things on their own. Others prefer teaming up with a more experienced developer to guide their work. Some need a very detailed spec upfront, while others are fine filling in the holes as they go along.<p>Would you force the guy who thrives while doing pair programming to work on his own? Sure, he might get some work done, but he won&#x27;t be as happy nor as productive as he is pair programming.<p>And the kicker is that those things change throughout people&#x27;s careers.<p>Education is exactly the same. You can force everyone in the same mold, but all it will lead to is people performing sub optimally and becoming frustrated. Should education ignore that?<p>---<p>It&#x27;s even worth it to take a step back and ask ourselves what the goal of school education should be. The average parent or teacher will probably answer that it is to develop the child&#x27;s skills and knowledge in a way that will enable him to attend a good college, to secure a good job, and to live their life comfortably.<p>The more we advance in society, the more we realize that this definition was perhaps sufficient 50 years ago (when it was very common and accepted to stop your studies after high school), but it is becoming less and less so. As our society starts to be comfortable with notions such as minimum basic income, that many jobs can and should be automated, that there will inevitably be more able-minded able-bodied adults than there are jobs available in the future and so on, we need to revisit what the purpose of education from ages ~3-18 should be.<p>Things we probably want education &quot;of the future&quot; to be about:<p>- creating citizens that have the means and the tools to instruct themselves and understand the world and society around them<p>- enabling the children and teenagers to build & live a fulfilling and constructive adult life (we might have to accept at some point that some people are fine playing the saxophone 10 hours a day, while some are fine programming 10 hours a day - one is not necessarily better than the other)<p>- building the skills to relate to your peers and help them to work towards the previous 2 points. Having worked in educational settings (think boarding school style, with everyday life mixed with instruction) where teenagers would be in regular contact with younger children (for example helping them during programming workshops etc.), I&#x27;ve noticed how much good it does to everyone involved. The younger kids love having someone just a tiny bit older than they are helping them out, and a lot of teenagers appreciate being handed some responsibilities. The current school system is very much a one way street (teachers teach and enforce rules, students sit down and listen), and it&#x27;s far from ideal.",1378326633

If you intend to truly read and understand all of the material he has presented, then you&#x27;re in it for the long run. Unless you are very educated or a researcher in the field, this is probably years worth of work. This includes reading all the mathematics, understanding it, and <i>doing the exercises</i>. (Of course, not all exercises can be reasonably done by anyone, as some of them are actually open research problems.)<p>Because you&#x27;d be in it for the long run, cheap paper copies are a bad idea, unless you don&#x27;t mind pages falling out and deteriorating. Doing a semester-long course in some subject? Okay, that&#x27;s fine. But purchasing for personal reasons the opus magnum of one of the greatest computer scientists? That feels a little different.<p>Although you&#x27;ve already paid a measly one-tenth of the price already, I&#x27;d consider paying the full price, and take your first as just a tax on the lesson learned. In the USA, many of us would get a 5-10% markup anyway (sales tax), so it&#x27;s not all that devastating.<p><i>Edit/Addendum</i>: Lastly, one important thing. For anyone reading this comment: While there is prestige in finding errors, that should not even be remotely close to the reason you purchase the books. The checks, in their original intent, are small awards for finding mistakes, and only somewhat artificially have they turned into something more. The true reward, as clich as this sounds, is being able to read Knuth&#x27;s prose and learning from it.<p>If you believe that having such an achievement will slingshot you ahead in business or academia, this is almost surely false. While the award is nice to get, it won&#x27;t give you much in return. I own two checks, and they&#x27;re on my rsum, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve carried much weight, if at all, at the multitude of companies I&#x27;ve applied for and been at. I think I&#x27;ve been asked about them only once, and even that time, the interviewer wasn&#x27;t interested in hearing about numerical algorithms or boolean satisfaction.",1378325418

How many companies have imploded because their software was not maintainable? That&#x27;s the other half of this article (Joel only wrote half an article, I contend). You can no longer make competitive bids for work because your impossible to understand. It takes months for the simplest change. Your customers leave in droves because your code is endlessly buggy, and you are pouring money into the drain of bug fixes that just introduce new bugs. Or, it is just a long drawn battle, as your profit margins slowly erode away as each new feature becomes incrementally more expensive to implement, until you are at negative return.<p>I say again; we have massive empirical evidence that total rewrites of very large infrastructure works. If you don&#x27;t do it, your competitors will do it for you. And, of course, if you do it when there is no competitive need for it, you will be flushing money and/or your company down the drain.<p>(edited to fix some grammar and clarify a few poorly worded points)",1378324821

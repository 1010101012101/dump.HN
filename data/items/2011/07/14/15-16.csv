2763557,comment,2763133,2763444,4,0,wheels,,,"As mentioned, this is on a single VPS with 256 MB of RAM.  Each Apache process needs about 25 MB of (non-shared) RAM, so actually 8 is pushing it.  We're using mpm_prefork.  There's no additional proxy nor cache.<p>My point, specifically, was how low you can go with a cheapo VPS.  We hold up fine during an HN spike.  (We're B2B and not a destination site, so our usual load is trivial.)  Even during an HN spike you're getting tops of 2-3 visitors per second, which can be dished out reasonably well with 8 workers.<p>The monit thing kicks in after a 30 second timeout.  With the configuration above, we don't get that because of load, but rather when something else has gone wrong (specifically there's a wordpress plugin that our internal status blog uses that sometimes hangs).  But given the original poster's issue of apache getting so out of control that it took him several minutes to get a live SSH connection and a system load of 60, having monit kill things (and restart them) is a preferable stop-gap.<p>(Note:  Our actual customer facing stuff is quite different; there we're using multiple servers behind an nginx proxy and using a combination of Rails, Sinatra and Java services.  The basic web stuff is segregated off from those primarily for security reasons.)",1310658673

Some creationist makes a publication claiming that evolution is wrong-- should be amusing!""<p>You're right that science should be objective. You then say that evolution is an observable phenomena. Well then, how could a paper disputing evolution be objective?<p>They're welcome to submit such a paper, as long as it's good science. It's not threatening, it's just potentially misleading to people who read it and gives the author the chance to claim legitimacy through publication. That's what the peer review process exists for, to weed out bad science, so that the general public is not required to try to evaluate claims that require expertise they don't have. Again, it certainly has its problems, but it's better than outsourcing to non-experts. Peer review can also sometimes be politically motivated, but, at least in my experience, that's often the argument of someone who's angry because their paper was rejected for legitimate reasons.<p>The fact that you think ""AGW"" is simply and provably false is also a beautiful demonstration of why we need peer review. You have a ridiculously simplistic view of the issue and of the status of consensus because you're opining on a question that's outside your field. (I'm just guessing, but you're not a climatologist, are you?) There are a lot of ""experts"" like yourself making similar claims who have no idea what state the field is in. If you tried to get such a paper published, professional climatologists would say, ""hey, we're not idiots, we study this for a living and have taken basic physics and chemistry. Nice try.""

It wasn't nearly so difficult to get started with web programming with java prior to 2005 (and I'm starting to detect a movement away from all encompassing frameworks even in java).

Hint: it's probably a continuum between no inversion of control and total inversion of control (not ""reversion of control"" btw). Many libraries provide some inversion of control mechanisms and ""force"" you to work their way (tyranny!!!). Is JQuery a library with all its callbacks and the use of $?

It depends on where you are in the product lifecycle, where your competitors are, how many developers you have, what your core features are vs. what features the frameworks can provide, etc.<p>For example, imagine that you invented a new programming language.

All of the cues, feedback mechanisms, and communication channels inherent in human nature are in full effect, and these usually generate appropriate and efficient responses to changing circumstances in real time.<p>But once you've gone beyond a certain level of scale, those mechanisms no longer function, and the more natural, emergent social context no longer forms a consistent substantive base layer.  The rules and processes that originally existed as an abstraction layer instead become the lowest available level of complexity; and since these rules are the product not merely of design, but of design that originally took place within constraints that are no longer present, the formal rules are usually quite insufficient as a substitute.<p>Even those who recognize this problem at this point can do little about it, because there's no longer a workable context in which to generate and implement a solution.  It may only be possible to avoid in advance by being very deliberate in the process of scaling, and building the organization as a 'confederation' of smaller groups divided along natural functional 'seams'.<p>This phenomenon may actually be more evident in politics than in business.",1310656774

This is especially true if you're using WordPress, for which there are a multitude of caching plug-ins. All of which will offer orders of magnitude better performance than allowing the blogging engine to build the page from scratch every time.<p>In other words, caching is <i>always</i> a priority. It's not an add-on or an after-thought, it should be part of your design.<p>Consider a scenario where someone asks you to add up three arbitrary numbers:<p>123 + 456 + 789<p>Now, imagine you type those in to a calculator to add them up. It takes you a few seconds. The output is 1368. You can easily remember this number, so the next time someone asks you what the result of 123 + 456 + 789 is, you can just say 1368. Not caching is like keying the numbers in to a calculator every time, rather than just relying on your memory.<p>I know this is a rudimentary example, and I know that most people running a WP blog probably know how caching works, but even if you don't ""need"" it today, why would you leave your blog set up so that it's constantly re-building content that can be cached by simply installing a WP plug-in?<p>I implore you. Make caching the second thing you do (after security) when setting up or building your web app.",1310656426

This is a distinction between Sales and Marketing, and an important one.

In a marketing sense it means that your goal has been reached (which may also be selling something, but could be an action).<p>For getting an MVP out I think this approach could work really well.

I'm perfectly capable of understanding what you mean if I'd really invest the time in it that I should. But why do I need to do such (relatively) complex yet abstract thinking when I want store a README, undo a mistake and then share it all with a colleague?",1310655811

It could be used to find suppliers and maybe incorporate a rating system so that businesses know which suppliers are good and which ones aren't.<p>The site could be used to manage the supply-chain as well. Say a company has 4 suppliers. Instead of contacting each one through email and working in a disorganized manner, the suppliers would communicate directly with the company through this website. If there is an issue with a shipment, the suppliers can let the company know promptly and the website would help them find alternative suppliers.<p>I don't really know the first thing about business to be honest. Does anyone know of a site like this that already exists, or any reasons as to why this would not be a good idea?<p>Thanks.",1310655772

The first wasn&#x27;t really usable for &quot;typed&quot; letters and such -- and either would take much more time than on a word processor.

It&#x27;s about processing <i>throughput</i> and not just absolute data size.  A lot of processing jobs can&#x27;t use indexes (except for lookup tables) so a PostgreSQL 4TB db with a schema for OLTP workloads doesn&#x27;t solve the issue.<p>A 4tb harddrive might be cheap for $150 but at 100MB/sec, it takes 11+ hours to read.  However, a big data cluster with 10 nodes can each scan their local 400GB shard and the batch job gets done in 1 hour.  Even newer 10TB mechanical harddrives with 150MB/sec (and multi disks RAID to saturate a SATA3 interface) isn&#x27;t going to fundamentally alter this throughput equation.  On the other hand, a potential 4TB SSD with 1GB/sec might be the sweet spot if the processing is not cpu-constrained.  But then again, new technology enables the goal posts to move[1], and people will invent new workloads that require a 100-node cluster each having a 10TB SSD to solve bigger problems.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand</a>",1432212629

AMD is painfully aware that their drivers lack compared to Nvidia but they disagree with the reason.  AMD does not want to put nearly as many hacks into the drivers as Nvidia does.  They went quite far (by making Mantle) to make the drivers leaner and more predictable.<p>Nvidia traditionally detects misbehaving game code and patches it up with various degrees in the driver.<p>> AMD didn&#x27;t set out to do anything: once again they sabotaged themselves by not getting involved.<p>AMD made the right step and backed the only thing that will evolve the situation from the status quo: Mantle and now Vulkan/DX12.  Otherwise they would always end up playing this game of magical drivers that NVidia supports but nobody likes.",1432210002

(I know, it's easy enough to write a small preprocessor that does it, and it's just primitive string based macros, but having a standard way to do it baked into the building tools or the interpreter for an interpreted language seems ...neat ...even cool if some more ""magic sauce"" would be added to it to make these ""macros"" hygienic :) ).",1352537854

Violent murderers probably don't make great employees.<p>It's a shame that the less violent low-level offenders will also find it hard to escape the life of crime, and it'd be great if there was some Mexican legal cannabis co-operative that rehabilitated gang members.<p>The cartels don't have a distribution network that would scale to legal distribution.  Catapulting bales of cannabis over the border isn't useful for legal businesses.<p>While their networks aren't much use for a legal business they are useful for more illegal business.  People trafficking is a high profit business.  Gun running is high profit business.  Other drugs - heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, are all still illegal and unlikely to become legal any time soon.",1352537612

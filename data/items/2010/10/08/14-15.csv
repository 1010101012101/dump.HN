1771770,comment,1770435,1770435,0,0,Bostwick,,,"I think my main problem with the article is that the three big, meaningful problems it presents are so vague as to be virtually unsolvable.<p>Let's use facebook as an example. Here's a problem: The internet and modern society drives people apart and increases isolation. Facebook's effect has been to greatly decrease this problem, but it's not the problem that Facebook set out to solve. The web app that Zuckerman copied and extended was designed as catalog of who was in a dormitory (house) at Harvard. \nIt just so happened that adding on messaging features and massively scaling this over time created a startup that also helps solve a larger social problem.<p>The problems the author presents as ""real"" problems are so ill-defined that it is impossible for technology startups to solve them. But, for people who actually work in those areas, I'm sure there exist problems web-apps could solve.<p>Here's an example: the problem of ""Many Americans can't afford medical care."" The cause of the high cost of health care is complex, relating to R&D at pharmaceutical companies, patent law, government regulations, and market incentives. Programming won't solve that. However, a problem that programmers _can_ solve is ""electronic medical records suck."" To that end, there are programmers working on that, and, hopefully, their work will uncover smaller problems also solvable.<p>I see large, ill-defined problems like this as a bit like the beginning of a recursive problem. The big problem needs to be broken down into a large series of smaller problems, some of which we, as programmers and entrepreneurs, may be able to solve. The hard part is knowing how to break the large problem into smaller ones, and the acknowledging the efforts of those people working on the smaller problems.",1286548597

Microsoft has identified patents as the most effective attack against anyone seeking to profit from FOSS. Rather than attack FOSS directly, you dump as much money as you can in to littering the intellectual property space for a given product with patent mines. Step on a patent mine and all of the sudden you're paying Microsoft (or someone else) for sitting on their ass and building a patent portfolio rather than innovating with any real products.<p>Under the old rules of engagement, patents were the equivalent of nuclear warheads. No one really wanted to use them, but they were good for making sure that your buddies across the street didn't fire off a salvo of patent suits in your direction. The problem for FOSS is that software patents are ideologically reprehensible to most of the people involved, therefore patents are not sought, and the intellectual property battlefield falls in to the hands of the patent trolls and big corporations.<p>As things stand today, we're looking at a future where patents become a large market in and of themselves. Big corporations will push for international cooperation for patent enforcement, and up-and-coming companies who benefit from FOSS are going to face significant new risks. The biggest losers will be consumers. Virtually all of the new internet giants stand on the shoulders of FOSS. It's only matter of time before the patent trolls find ways to attack everyone using their ""IP"".",1286548568

Wings either use flaps or some mechanism that causes them to bend that alters how much lift they produce at a given speed, angle of attack, etc..  The thing is that the reference frame you choose is important.<p>If you have 0 lift, you're in free fall…a phenomenon that a lot of planes can do.  If you can push whatever that distortion in wing shape (flaps or bending) a bit farther, then you can dive faster than freefall, that is producing lift in the downward direction.<p>Now, just turn the plane upside down and do the same thing.<p>The freakier thing is that helicopters can theoretically fly upside-down.

Clark's notation rocks.\n* Some XML tools/libraries/whatever manage not to understand namespaces correctly.\n* It's backwards-compatible with non-namespace-aware parsers. This is what makes XML namespaces broken and lets people avoid understanding them.<p>They're not even hard to get, you just have to understand a namespaced name is a shortcut for a pair of (namespace-uri, local-name), and that a namespace is scoped to the node it's declared on. And you're set, you're done with namespaces.<p>But instead, you have numbskull who tell you ElementTree 1.2 is broken because it has a very good handling of namespaces but doesn't let you configure a default namespace or customize namespace aliases on serialization (it just sets them as ``ns\d``).<p>Oh yeah, now that I think about it there is one completely broken thing about XML namespaces (as far as I'm concerned): an element with no specified namespace lives in the current default namespace (``xmlns=uri``), but an <i>attribute</i> with no specified namespace lives min the ""null"" namespace instead.

The law allowed a huge industry to grow around information asymmetry, hype, and price inflation.

It's simply my hope that the top performers there will justify themselves while producing perhaps a new era of relevant work. Increased competition doesn't always involve complete steamrolling, just evolution.<p>(In fact, one evolution I could see happening is a design firm outsourcing some percentage of their own mock work to crowdsource sites.

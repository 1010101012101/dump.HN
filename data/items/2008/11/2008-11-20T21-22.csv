Overweight (92.5%) and obese (91.5%) women are significantly more likely ever to have had sexual intercourse with men than normal-weight women (87.4%).</i><p>Is this primarily due to the fact that women get fatter as they get older and hence the overweight/obese group is overloaded with the women at the high end of the (15-44) age range? Probably.<p>Also this bit:<p><i>When a man propositions a woman, she can respond in one of two ways; she can say “yes” or she can say “no.”  When a woman propositions a man, he can also respond in one of two ways; he can say “yes” or he can say “yes, please.”  He has no realistic choice to say no.</i><p>thankfully is <i>not</i> true.

315724,comment,315692,315692,0,0,shadytrees,,,"I'm noticing that some of the comments are one-worded or just off-topic drivel. Either there should be a stringent culture of down-modding those comments or moderators should actively communicate with those users and discourage that behavior. It's better to set the bar a little high at the beginning than too low since the level of discourse will inevitably decrease as more people join.",1222399175

The top part, ask could be the search input and make a bottom part for share, then have a scrolling list of things people are sharing (feeds, etc).  I noticed you have a couple of applications based upon sharing (photos, groups) so you are into sharing.",1222399066

That's why we haven't been back in 40 years.<p>The Mars rovers are the exception the proves the rule. Operational for years after a few hundred million dollars spent, while each shuttle mission eats over $1B.<p>Any reasonable manager would have scrapped the shuttle long ago.<p>The reason NASA does more is that we have more money than others, not because they are better.<p>The goal after all is long term benefit to the human race (or profit). Nasa hasn't done all that much towards that end. If anything, they were a good excuse to design ICBMs.",1222399021

I recently finished the book ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" which draws a lot of parallels between rats and humans (basically we have a lot of the same adaptations around eating).

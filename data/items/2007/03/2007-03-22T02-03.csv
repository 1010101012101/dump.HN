There are gaps in these lists but pretty much cover the <i>best</i> for both <i>programmers</i> & <i>business - types</i>. But the lists needs updating as I note pg's <i>'Painters & Hackers'</i> is not listed nor is Cal Hendersons <i>'Building Scalable Websites'</i> [3].<p>

I can't see if you are frowning or smiling as you read this, I can't hear if your voice is desperate or confident.  I would bet that much of that information contributes to ape-like creatures sense of well being and progress. ",1174531524

5580,comment,5482,5482,0,0,bootload,,,"good sociologist type q's raised here. <p>could this 'loneliness' be an indicator of 'personality' as well as being a single founder? For instance are you (anyone) <i>energised</i>  in the presence of crowds? (for me, no).  Variations in founder personality types come into play here.<p>could also be an indicator of how many 'related/non-related' social groups you inhabit. Do you meet others in other social contexts?  I mix in 3-4 non startup groups, thats more than enough.<p>There are definite advantages of working in groups of like minded. The sharing of knowledge, contacts, protection ~ I'm primarily thinking of how other ape-like creatures work/live, passing on knowledge & skills. Doesn't the web allow this kind of behaviour virtually?<p>",1174530683

5578,comment,5569,5573,0,0,danw,,,"It took a long time for most bigcos to adopt mobile phones too.<p>From what I've heard trying to sign a bigco up for anything is a lot of work, usualy far more than a small startup can afford to spend on a single customer. The company will spend so long evaluating your software that you'll have run out of cash before hearing a yes/no from them. Better to chase individuals/small biz at the start because they're easier to sell to. Of course there will always be exceptions (loopt and boost springs to mind despite not being an enterprise app).",1174530535
5577,comment,5523,5549,0,0,python_kiss,,,"If I were to tag this link, it would've been ""Guy, Kavasaki, Eric, Schmidt, Google, CEO, Interview"". There is a good chance Dan would have done the same. So tagging helps a lot.<p>Moreover, tagging leaves open the option to build recommender systems through collaborative filtering. I believe one of the reasons Reddit's recommendation tab was broken for so long (and still is) was because it was difficult to relate content without the use of tags.",1174530209

5574,comment,5572,5572,0,0,python_kiss,,,"About 14 months ago, I had little knowledge of how to execute a startup. In particular, I wasn't familiar with any online marketing tactics. The following books helped me a lot in that respective, and more:<p>
1. Positioning, 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing/Branding, Focus, Marketing Warfare<p>2. Purple Cow, All Marketers are Liars, Permission Marketing (I didn't like ""The Big Moo"", ""Free prize inside"" or ""Small is the new Big"").<p>3. Founters At Work<p>4. Wikinomics, Wisdom of Crowds, The Tipping Point (Blink! was alright). I am looking forward to reading ""The Long Tail"" and ""The starfish and the spider""...has anyone read them yet?<p>6. Why We Buy<p>7. Hackers and Painters<p>8. The E-Myth revisited<p>9. The Art of the Start<p>10.

It just means they won't get the big cos as customers till they themselves grow larger.

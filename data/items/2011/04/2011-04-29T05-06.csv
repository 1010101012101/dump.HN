One could argue there are enough resources and means of production on the world for everyone. It's just that the ""haves"" want more and more, and then throw it away and want even more.<p>Otherwise -- A Star Trek replicator would just speed up the treadmill of consumerism. You can have any toy you want instantly. In our current society, this would probably mean that fashions change every three minutes, and the rich part of the population will use so much energy that the have-nots will still be deprived of even basic living conditions.",1304056759

Now I understand that press-governemntal relations have gotten unusually cozy over the last few decades; with the press becoming almost an extension of the White House media arm.<p>At the same time, it is understandable for the President to be hesitant to allow such close access to their person, or to moments where things are said and done in a rather different manner than publicly presented. For example, if my girlfriend ever heard me say some things about her when I'm in beer-and-xbox mode with my closest buddies, I'd probably face a shitstorm.<p>Every once in a while when a politician forgets to turn off their mics and says something inappropriate, there's a kerfuffle about. But they need to be able to say those things in private. This pen-and-paper-only press-pool is a middle ground, so that the press can have some access, without having videos of inappropriate remarks or moments plastering across the 24/7 news media networks.<p>I see nothing wrong with this. Now on the other hand, if we are talking about the unusually cozy relationship of the media in restricting their criticism of the military, or military operations for fear of jeopardizing their embedded-access, then that's another story. Or the Washington bureaus cowardice in challenging the administration in the briefing room. I wish reporters would show more courage in those situations. But those situations are necessarily outside ones. They should gladly give up access, refuse to be cozied up to, refuse to go to those god-awful Correspondents' Dinners where they are wined and dined and bought.

Jeffries, Head of Legal Operations at Facebook, where I work with the team that handles incoming notices of intellectual property infringement.  I wanted to provide a little color about what happened in this situation.<p>As you may have heard, today we investigated a number of recent trademark (intellectual property) takedowns, and as a result of this investigation we restored four Facebook Pages.  We apologize for any disruption to those who posted content.<p>Taking a step back, abuse of DMCA and other intellectual property notice procedures is a challenge for every major Internet service, and we take it seriously.  In many cases, when we're put on notice we're obligated to take appropriate action.  We have invested significant resources into creating a dedicated team (including me) that uses specialized tools, systems, and technology to review and properly handle these intellectual property notices.  This system evaluates a number of factors when deciding how to respond -- and in many cases, we require the reporter to provide additional information before we can take action.<p>As a result of these efforts, the vast majority of intellectual property notices that we receive are handled without incident.  Of course, no system is perfect and we're always striving to improve our practices.  Rest assured that the dedicated team who handle incoming complaints from rights holders are equally devoted to protecting the interests of people expressing themselves on Facebook.  As part of our ongoing efforts to improve, we will be considering the results of our investigation into this matter as we continue to refine our systems and procedures.",1304053817

The community has definitely felt some growing pains, but it is absolutely not clear that hiding comment scores has helped.<p>Looking at the best comments page, no I don't think it looks particularly better (or worse) than it did a few months ago.<p>On that best comments page, look at how many of them are on threads (including this one) asking to bring scores back.<p>When pg put it to a vote, more people wanted to see them than not.<p>Since the community was the backbone and validity of the voting system, by taking away the visibility voting system we are taking away quite a bit of faith in the community.  If we don't think the voting system is valuable for viewable scores, why is it valuable for sorting the threads?  Adding to the fact that a significant majority wanted them shown, it doesn't really seem like we've got a lot of faith in the community as a whole.  And if we don't have faith in the community, doesn't that mean HN is kind of dead and we just don't know it yet?<p>I don't think it is, and I think the upvote system is imperfect but worked much better than nothing.

When a ""popular"" name is attached to a post it gets read more closely and frequently voted up.  If HN users were truly interested in letting the ""quality"" of the content stand on its own then comments would not have names attached to them and the content would <i>truly</i> stand on its own.<p>> when evaluating someone's comment it would be good to see other comments they've made that might provide insight into their biases.<p>In other words, let the popularity of a username influence the visibility of the content.  If you are suggesting that people (including yourself) actually go back and check out user comment histories with any frequency I think you are mistaken.<p>Karma is not just popularity, it is also a measure of perceived authority and insight that a comment provides to a discussion.

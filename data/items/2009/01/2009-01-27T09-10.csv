451866,story,,,39,54,RiderOfGiraffes,"Ask HN: Why do non-techies simply not ""get"" the idea of a wiki?",,"We here at work have been trying to reduce paperwork while simultaneously increasing knowledge dissemination.  For some time the techies have been using a wiki, and others are starting to get the point that when they ask a question the first response is ""Have you checked on the wiki?""  The answer until recently has always been ""no"", and the question now is answered about half the time by doing what they should have done in the first place.<p>It's like ""Let me Google that for you""<p>So we've moved the holiday booking system to the wiki.  Now people can say when they're away on site, working from home, sick, or on leave.  The leave days can be booked in advance and then confirmed by their line manager.  At a glance we can see who is in, out, available or away, and the system is really helping our planning.  Suddenly everyone knows when someone is on site and might need support, or on leave and unable to help.  The non-techies have themselves said, when shown it, that it's really useful.<p>But the non-techies just don't ""get it.""  They won't update the wiki, they still don't look at the wiki, they never add information to the wiki.  Instead, they insist on sending things by email.  Then in a few weeks time people are asking, and we have to trawl through email systems to find the information.<p>Except we (the techies) don't, because when we get information we put it on the wiki.  Then when the non-techies ask us anything we can say ""Have you checked the wiki?""<p>And they still don't get it.<p>Where is the mis-match?  How can we make a wiki as accessible/understandable as a Word document?<p>How can we help the non-techies attain enlightenment?<p><i>Can</i> the non-techies attain enlightenment?",1233049039

451855,comment,451432,451432,0,0,h34t,,,"Before I was overcome with a hell-bent desire to actually learn how to program, ExpressionEngine (EE) let me build relatively powerful custom database-driven applications without using any code except its template tags in addition to the obligatory HTML/CSS/Javascript. If that's the definition of what a CMS is supposed to do, then I think EE nails it.<p>I haven't used it since 2005, but it looks like they've been steadily improving (their dev team was really responsive) and I believe EE was used to run Change.gov.<p>It has a powerful templating engine. My inner designer is obsessive about fine-grained control over the end result of any project I do, and I don't remember a time when EE prevented me from achieving the design I wanted.<p>I also liked its custom fields and 'weblogs'. EE 'weblogs' can be thought of as custom database tables, which are easily created and modified by the EE graphical interface. You can then create as many custom fields as you want, and relationships between fields, and then insert your data however you want into your website using simple template tags.<p>So, for example, I made a personal website in which I could keep track of books I'd read, the authors, quotes that I liked, and my book reviews. Each kind of item was stored in its own table and I could insert all the relevant information for any book into a blog post by using a custom tag.",1233048340

In fact, I'd venture it would be much, much worse.<p>At least in the current system you're protected, and potentially rewarded - even if everyone thinks it's a bad idea (which is often the case for break-through innovations).<p>The current system is not well tuned to current technology. If you patent the steam regulator, the idea was that you would sell then far and wide... In the industry now it's used to lock up a technology for exclusive use.<p>Maybe a patent should coffer the rights to an invention - and the patent is also opened up for auction by the govt to ""n"" organisations (where n is somehow determined to maximise profit), with the profits going to the patent holder.",1233047817

There has been a trend to enable the original researcher to bear the costs of reviewing and making available their research but this can cost several hundred pounds and is rarely covered by grants.

451840,comment,451595,451595,0,0,kfb,,,"I agree with most of the advice given so far, but be careful that you do not interpret it too liberally.  You can't get around payroll by just calling your workers contractors and sending them a 1099. The IRS has pretty stringent rules about who is a contractor and who isn't. Furthermore, you can't get around paying payroll taxes by not taking a salary yourself. The IRS presumes no one would work for free so expects everyone working for the company is getting compensated somehow. If you are a valid contractor, it is fine to get paid as such.  But if you are working full time long term for the company I can't imagine there is an accountant or lawyer who will tell you it is ok to call yourself a contractor and skip doing payroll.",1233046986

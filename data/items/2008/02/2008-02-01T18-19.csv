It actually parses consumer reviews and quantifies what people are saying about a product (e.g., an IPhone has great screen but bad battery life). I'm very pleased with how it's turning out.<p>Unfortunately, PG turned us down last spring :(",1201892258

Of course everyone who still has Yahoo stock think that the price is too low--because everyone who thinks the price is too high has already sold their shares.<p>So everyone who still holds any given stock thinks that the market price is too low.",1201892170

I was trying to judge Arc entirely by the standards that Paul set for it in his foundational essays.<p>> what would it take for you to use Arc instead of Python for web programming?<p>At the very least better documentation :-)  There appear to be some really cool things in the Arc web infrastructure, but the only way to figure out how to use them at the moment seems to be to reverse-engineer the code.",1201891970

Too many to count...<p>But my plan is to continue to use CLISP until I become convinced that arc will help me in some way. I have almost 20,000 lines of CLISP I have developed and thus I am quite reluctant to even contemplate a switch.<p>I will put it bluntly, ""what's wrong with common LISP?""<p>If somehow people don't like all the redundancy, well use the subset you like. That's what I do. Sure it would be nice to have a language that forced some kind of uniformity and consistency in its nature. But these are abstract/fluffy terms. And like I said I have 20k lines of LISP that I am not interested in porting...<p>But if a crystal clear reason were to emerge, then yes I would do it. I do have an open mind.",1201891722

107948,comment,107771,107771,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"Some seemingly minor issues make me wonder how bad a situation Yahoo is in. Google has integrated their messenger into chat well enough that you can search through chats, grouped separately, as well as send messages of either kind to people you have contacted through chat or email. This makes a whole lot of sense, and I would think is relatively easy to accomplish. However, Yahoo's messenger is a bloated spam attracting monstrosity that seems like an estranged sibling to Yahoo's equally hideous email service; all the distressing genetic similarities but no conversation. Now how can a company that couldn't integrate two obvious candidates from their own bundle of services do in Microsoft, which isn't any better at integrating its own cluster? I don't see synergy.",1201890658

107942,comment,107771,107930,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"It's simple. Half of you will all be fired and Yahoo will merge with MSN to create a monstrosity web division. The overlap in web products will create 3 tiers of service, the windows-ized integrated Live products (Live Mail, Live Search), the consumer centric Yahoo products (Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Search), and the pro-sumer products (Inktomi Search, Flickr, Delicious). This will be so confusing and stupid that after 2 or 3 years of Google eating their lunch they're fire the rest of the Yahoo staff and shutter off the Yahoo branded products in favor of the Live products.<p>But also, let's not kid ourselves, Microsoft could give two shits about Flickr. What they really want is Yahoo/Overture/Panama or whatever. That's the expected growth and cash cow that makes this deal possible.",1201890178

We started out with a server much like that and were able to deal with a good techcrunching on it.  The first thing you'll want to do when you get more users, though, is get a separate database server so you can have more available ram for things like query caches, buffer pools, and etc.",1201889483

You seem to know much more about these things than I do, so I don't have much to add.<p>2. call-it: What's the problem with not knowing (+ 1 2) until run-time? Efficiency? Then I would argue that expressive power of the core language ought to take precedence. In an actual implementation, funcall could leave (+ 1 2) to be evaluated (or not) inside the function body. I would add funcall-normal-function to the language, which would amount to a funcall + (declare (normal-function f)). Both for documentation and for efficiency.<p>Of course, not knowing if (funcall x (print 2)) will print 2 is unsettling in a way, but that's the same basic argument that's made against macros. They disrupt the evaluation order.<p>I read about normal-order before, but it didn't make much practical sense. I'll Google your pointers and look it up.",1201889286

107935,comment,107623,107709,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I'm sure I'm not a good representative Lisping example, but I routinely use let to bind more than one variable, especially when extracting program state from a URL in multiple variables, and probably use the implicit progn in cond 70% of the time.  I can see the value of not allowing the implicit progn which would force creating more numerous and smaller functions, but in the case where I have only 2 expressions in a cond, a function just for that would seem a bit verbose.  But again, this is really no big deal as with ARC, one can write a macro utility to put the multiple option back in.",1201889122

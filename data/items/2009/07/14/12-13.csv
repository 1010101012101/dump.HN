703541,comment,703086,703358,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Does anybody actually read, let alone abide by these open source licenses?</i><p>Of course.  If you don't, you can't use the code.  Thousands of companies and millions of individuals are abiding by these open source licenses every day.<p><i>I can't imagine actually picking through one of them and making strategy decisions based on them.</i><p>Then you can't use the code.  You'll have to buy non-Open licensed code, or write it yourself.<p><i>Has anybody ever actually been called on it?</i><p>Yes.  Though it rarely comes to lawsuits.  The GPL is a pretty strong license, from a legal perspective.  The people who've tested it aggressively have suffered the consequences (SCOX, for example).  Some others (The Artistic License, for example) are more questionable and less strong from a legal perspective, but even the weak ones have proven to hold up pretty well in court (there is an ongoing trial involving the Artistic License, though sort of indirectly, but it seems to be holding its own in the eyes of the law).<p><i>Are there really companies that have open-sourced their entire product just because they use some random little GPL library?</i><p>You've already admitted to being willfully and proudly ignorant about Open Source licensing in multiple posts in this thread.  So, why are you being so damned pushy about sharing your ill-informed opinions on the subject?<p>You are assuming the GPL is intended as a trap to lure unsuspecting businesses into being forced to open their code.  It is not, and it's a symptom of your ignorance that you think it is.  It is a license that allows anyone to use the code, provided they share the results under the same terms.  In the event of a license violation (which is in no ones best interest), there are many possible outcomes, only one of which is opening of everything the code ever touched.  Law, including copyright law upon which the GPL (and all other software licenses) are based, has many shades of nuance.<p><i>I tend to avoid using 3rd party code, as it invariably ends up being garbage</i><p>This says more about the limits of your experience than about Open Source software or licenses, and is not relevant to this discussion.",1247574611

There are many many ways you could monetize the ability to communicate over the skype protocol. You could build cool plugin services. You could build something to make peoples voices sound like robots - disguizr.com or b2b stuff, voicemail, you could build your own skypeout competitor. etc etc etc you could build conferencing services ontop of it.

ZFS has it exactly right with the built-in checksumming on write and read - it can't stop a disk going bad, but it can tell you exactly what's affected and _when_ - corruption would've been caught the moment the mirroring operation tried to read back bad data (and would've faulted the process, rather then happily return bad data).",1364125537

The greater levels of unionisation in Finland compared to the USA tell us exactly nothing on their own.<p>Requiring master's degrees may improve education but probably not for the reasons most people expect: it encourages greater selectivity and filters out those with less commitment and desire to be a teacher. But, as someone with a little experience of teaching in high schools, I doubt that learning to teach outside of a classroom has any positive effect on teacher performance. Effective teaching is about understanding your pupils, knowing how to communicate and having the ability to effectively prepare materials, all skills that can only be learned through classroom experience. I would argue that the most effective form of teacher training would be to require prospective teachers to do several years as assistant/apprentice teachers in schools, and do away with all education degrees.",1364125174

5431744,comment,5431188,5431188,3,0,tokenadult,,,"I thought about this among my Facebook friends before replying here. I agree with the premise that children need plenty of time in their youth that isn't overly structured by adults. That's one of the reasons that my family homeschools rather than sending our children to our fine local public school system (which draws in students from all over the state through open enrollment). By test, and by verification through conversation with other adults who know our children, our children have no problem learning the essential information that children need to learn in childhood for independent adult life. But they learn more efficiently, because of the flexibility of homeschooling, and they thus have more time to pursue personal interests and creative activities. (The creative activities include short story writing for all our children, programming in a variety of languages for our oldest, and visual art for all the younger children.)<p>We do have our children in some external programs that structure some of their time. We particularly like our local youth soccer association because its coaching philosophy strongly emphasizes letting the young players make their own decisions on the field and not coaching from the sidelines. I never knew that there was such a thing as ""creativity"" in soccer until I watched dozens of games over several years and saw how each of our children expresses a different personality on the soccer field, all while coordinating effort with teammates. Soccer truly is a beautiful game when played by players who have played together for a decade and who know one another.<p>AFTER EDIT: I beg to differ with the comment quoted below,<p><i>There are great rockers from places nobody would remotely associate with great music (Bob Dylan and Prince are both from Minnesota, for instance).</i><p>from another top-level comment in this thread. I associate Minnesota with great music, because I live here. (Dylan and Prince are all right, but I'm not sure I'd even agree that they are the peak of what Minnesota has to offer in music. And Minnesota is by no means the most boring state in the United States, as my mother who moved here from elsewhere is glad to let people know.)",1364124481

</code></pre>
There is no equivalent of <i>rm -rf</i> in git. If you remove files being versioned and commit them, the previous version still exists and the commit can be reverted. If you remove the metadata, no sync can happen, you are immediately warned (assuming good monitoring was set up) and can restore from one of the clones. If the entire machine crashes and burns, you whip out your <i>git-server-create.sh</i>, which provisions a new VM and restores from one of the clones. There is no additional data to be backup up with git. Any single developer with a recent clone of the repos can setup a new master git server.",1364124402

Instead they simply count clicks on the search result link, and apply some mathematics related to the probability that you click that link, when it's so and so far away from the top.

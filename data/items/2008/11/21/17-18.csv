372144,comment,371227,372113,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"Community website operators do have a duty to monitor for suicides to some extent, just as they have a duty to monitor for other things.  But failure to meet perfection in the pursuit of a virtue is not morally the same as a vice.  Online communities have moderators in much the same way as real communities have police--they're society's protection against something going wrong with the social contract.  When they individually fail, they may (individually or collectively) bear some level of moral responsibility for the matter, but the buck stops there.  The only way moral responsibility can find its way to the top is if it is clear that the community in vastly under-equipped to deal with such problems to begin with, and there is an expectation that such things will be actively prevented within the social contract.  When a murder or suicide takes place in a physical town, neither the city (as a political unit) nor the mayor is personally morally responsible; a virtual town is no different.<p>I understand that you aren't necessarily saying that you entirely believe the views you're espousing; any debate in a public forum should be as much (if not more so) of a benefit for the observers as it is for the participants.  Clearly stating both sides of an argument helps everyone involved understand the precise nature of the issue.",1227290356

372124,comment,372046,372046,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Love this. Determining how these ""hidden metric spaces"" arise in neural networks during the course of evolution could have great impact on the understanding of the brain. Dan Dennett talks of consciousness as a ""meme machine"" made up of lots of little unconscious ""robots"" or neurons. Perhaps this is not the entire story though. Perhaps the neurons have evolved to maximize efficiency in communication by means of some hidden metric space. I wonder if associations of ""synchronicity"" could come into play here. Say neuron A wants to get a signal to Location L following some Input I. Neuron A doesn't know Location L but knows that Neuron B always fires when something happens in L. So it sends the signal over to Neuron B, which, sure enough, passes it along to L, therefore, Neuron A is able to get the signal following a certain input over to L without knowing exactly the topological connections to L. Of course words like ""know"" and ""want"" are used metaphorically, obviously this arises dynamically via blind trial and error. So Dennett's robots take on a new layer of interest: perhaps by being able to form associations between temporally or spatially related events, they can construct signal patterns via a ""hidden metric space"" for better efficiency. Figuring out how this additional efficiency comes about by figuring out how these hidden connections evolve could make artificial neural nets more efficient. Right now, I think neural nets are largely ""brute force"" - add more neurons for better results. But perhaps hidden metric spaces could help us get better results from the same neuron number. Anyway. Way cool.",1227289132

Other people don't really see them.<p>Because of that, I think Google can encourage the behavior where people are sending links relevant to themselves up to the their front page in an honest way.  If they click things up that have no relevance to themselves, they only screw up their own searches.<p>So if you have millions of people sending things relevant to themselves up the list, Google is basically gathering data about what the human 'gold standard' for a particular search query is (augmented by machine sorting first).<p>In information retrieval, one of the hard things is to know whether you've done a better job of returning search results or not, since a gold standard dataset is hard to come by and time consuming to produce.<p>Here, I think Google is simply using a mechanism where they're aligning people's self-interest to create accurate data they can use to compare their search algorithm tweaks.<p>All in all, a good thing.  Even better if you can 'merge' search results from others that you trust..say your friends.  I wouldn't mind merging my search results with _why's.  More complexity that way, though.",1227286833

He has given a very specific amount of money he&#x27;d be willing to pay to find that traction.<p>You, a self proclaimed expert in accelerating startups, then give him a rather bland and generalized &quot;internet marketing&quot; blog post.

When discussing flaws in his clan’s software he always took personal responsibility, yet when receiving praise for marvelous features crafted by him alone, he always gave credit to the entire team. Eventually word of the monk came to old Jinyu, Abbess Over All Clans And Concerns.<p>“So,” she said to her chief abbot, “this monk says &#x27;I failed&#x27; after the defeats of others, and &#x27;we triumphed&#x27; after his own victories?”<p>“So it is said throughout the Temple,” said the abbot.<p>“Bring him to me,” commanded Jinyu.<p>When this was done, Jinyu surprised all in attendance by striking the monk with her cane and sentencing him to thirty days’ hard labor in the data mines. After the stunned monk had been taken away the abbot nervously approached Jinyu to inquire the reason.<p>Jinyu struck the abbot. “Fool! Consider the monk’s algorithm. When he says &#x27;I failed&#x27;, what is most probably the truth?”<p>“That others have failed,” said the abbot, flinching.<p>Jinyu struck him again. “And when the monk says &#x27;we triumphed&#x27;, what does he most likely mean?”<p>“That victory was his alone,” said the abbot, wincing in pain.<p>The ancient priestess twirled her cane overhead, so fast that the very air whined in anguish, until with a thunderclap she brought it down hard on the floor in front of the terrified abbot. “The only thing praiseworthy about this boastful monk is that he has mastered the art of one-to-one mapping.

I know a couple of people who spent a lot of time volunteering for a cult in California. The leader was a genuinely dangerous psychopath and exploiter, but they don&#x27;t seem to mind because they never met him personally, most of the people they met were nice, and it&#x27;s where they met each other.<p>That may be unusual, but cults often collect curious, generous, and rather insecure people who are herded and abused by a few crazies. So it may not be that unusual to have a good experience, as long as you can avoid becoming a toy/servant/sex slave/cash cow for the leadership.<p>Creating all of the above is the true aim of every cult.

10306434,comment,10302879,10305137,0,0,twic,,,"Why Maven rather than Gradle? Gradle has all the libraries in Maven Central. Gradle also has an extensive set of useful plugins built in [1], and many more available externally [2]. In particular, there&#x27;s a plugin for making a fat jar [3], and even without a plugin, it&#x27;s a few lines of code [4]. Or you can also make something more exotic like a capsule [5] or a shell script [6], or my preferred format, a &#x27;distribution zip&#x27; file containing loose jars and a shell script [7] - which you can even make executable, because i wanted to troll my boss one day [8]).<p>And there&#x27;s no XML, it&#x27;s pretty concise (Groovy syntax, convention over configuration, sensible defaults), and although its raw speed is no better than Maven&#x27;s, it is smart enough to only execute tasks which are needed (rather than everything, every time, as Maven does), and can run as a daemon to avoid startup costs [9], so in practice it&#x27;s far faster than Maven. Still downloads the internet now and then, though.<p>But extension is an absolute joy - there is simply no comparison to Maven. There&#x27;s a very satisfying spectrum of ways to define your own tasks, from blocks of code right in the build script, to classes defined in the build script [10], to externally packaged plugins, all of which are easy to do and integrate fully with the existing machinery (task dependencies, handling files, inputs and outputs, and so on).<p>Then there&#x27;s the stuff you might not even notice until you get off Maven. Gradle builds are graphs of tasks, not sequences of lifecycle phases, so it&#x27;s trivial to add more tasks, rearrange, tasks, etc. Concrete example: Maven provides a single test task (surefire); if you want a second (say, for functional tests), you can use a plugin (failsafe); if you want a third (say, for external contract tests), you&#x27;ll need to write a plugin. In Gradle, you&#x27;d just make another instance of the test task. It&#x27;s a few lines of code.<p>Sorry if i sound like a fanboy or a shill, but Gradle, while far from perfect, is so much better than Maven in every way that it pains me to see a fellow human being suffering under the latter. Seriously, Maven is obsolete. Just use Gradle.

The job of creating a patch and merging it with the main expansion file is placed on the app developer. Additionally there can only be one patch to each main extension file. There is not a new delta generated for each new version of the expansion file.<p>I&#x27;m not at all surprised if most developers just ignores the patch option all together and just re-uploads a new main expansion file every time any content has changed.<p>Besides, while seemingly well documented[0], IME expansion files requires quite a lot of undocumented magic. Including patching Google&#x27;s own source code. Code that they recommend that you vendor into the app rather than include as a library.<p>Further the user experience is less than stellar. On many devices the expansion is only downloaded after the app is started the first time. So the app needs to work even while the file is missing, and at that time manually request that the system retrieves the file.<p>BTW, did anyone notice the fine print of this announcement? Only devices with Android 4.0 or newer supports 100 MB apk:s. If your app supports 2.3 - i.e. some 70 million Android users - you&#x27;re stuck at 50 MB and will have to keep using expansion files to serve those users.<p>[0] <a href=""https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.ht...</a>",1443641120

I was skeptical too - I was a physics major in college, I know all about potential vs. kinetic energy and rolling resistance.  But engines are not perfectly efficient: you&#x27;re going to lose some energy to internal friction within the engine, and to combustion efficiency, and to transmission losses, and to a number of other effects which vary based on speed, RPM, and torque.  Add in an engine computer that&#x27;s trying to minimize these effects based on inputs, and actual fuel efficiency will vary significantly from the simple &quot;chemical energy in = kinetic energy out&quot; model.<p>I&#x27;ve also observed the effect that the OP mentioned: in my Honda Fit, I get a fairly consistent ~45 MPG on 101 (completely flat highway terrain), ~40 MPG on 280 (rolling hills, highway), and ~43 MPG on 84 (across the Santa Cruz Mountains; ascends 3000 ft. in a series of tight switchbacks and then descends 3000 ft. in a wavy line).  My working hypothesis is that the descent on 84 is consistent enough that the engine computer can idle the engine for all of it, burning no fuel - this is consistent with the car being nearly silent on the downhill, and of the instantaneous mileage display being stuck at its max of 80 MPG.  Probably also helps that speeds are much lower, so there&#x27;s less air resistance.<p>Anyway, the point is that cars are complex enough that the simple models you learn in Physics 101 don&#x27;t really hold.",1443640108

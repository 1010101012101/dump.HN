No one believes Chandra’s story nor does it sound very plausible""<p>I don't really see any evidence to support this statement. At best it's 50/50 and at worst Mr. Arrington's reputation is possibly tipping it in FG's favor. Personally I think it's pretty obvious that a blogger/business man had little or nothing to do with the actual nuts & bolts development of the product. Entirely possible his money was involved but we don't know yet.<p>""If I were @arrington I’d be breathing a big sigh of relief. A $500 tablet is NOT what he envisioned.""<p>He started at $300, then it was $400. Now it's $500. It doesn't seem while he was involved pricing was working out exactly as he had envisioned. Perhaps this disparity alone explains the true situation. FG doesn't seem to be equipped to puke out millions of CrunchPads selling for a tiny margin. They can however sell a product with a higher margin to a smaller tablet loving audience. It's a much more realistic business model for FG. Once you hit $400 another $100 really doesn't really matter that much. As Apple said the iPod Touch and iPhone took off at $199. That's the price point a mainstream audience will pay. Arrington's business model for the CrunchPad was probably a little too pie-in-the-sky for FG.",1260237664

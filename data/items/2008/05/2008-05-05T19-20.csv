181732,comment,181368,181368,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I very much agree with this article.<p>Reminds me of the evolution of my lisp HTML compiler. At first I simply made a macro that transforms:<p><pre><code>  (:tag :attribute ""value"" (:p ""Paragraph""))
</code></pre>
into appropriate code to output the HTML at runtime. But the problem is that I couldn't inspect or transform my HTML; this macro-based scheme was way too brittle.<p>So instead I wrote another macro with the same syntax but that instead generates code to build a semantic representation of HTML at runtime:<p><pre><code>  (make-instance 'html-node :type ""tag"" :attributes (cons ""attribute"" ""value"" :children (list (make-instance 'html-node :type ""p"" :children (list ""Paragraph"")))))
</code></pre>
I then pass this representation to a compiler that first optimizes (""flattens"" the structure and appends contiguous strings together) and then compiles into an efficient tree of closures. I still have a version of the macro that generates efficient code to output the HTML directly that I use in my dynamic HTML generation functions, but I use that only when necessary.<p>The advantage is that now I can do all sorts of static analysis on my HTML (I use a similar scheme for CSS). Believe it or not, in a ""dynamic"" site there's TONS of static (as in, known before someone even tries to access the page) information. I even have a scheme to ""inject"" stuff into pages, for example the (page-sensitive) navigation is automatically ""baked"" into the appropriate pages.<p>Eventually I want to make a ""site debugger"" with all the semantic data I have about my site. I'll have powerful querying capabilities to answer questions like: ""What pages in my site have an A tag that links to page X and is nested in a container affected by CSS rule Y?"". Maybe I can even make some kind of advanced editor. Owning your data opens lots of interesting possibilities indeed!<p>So, I get all the semantic data <i></i>plus<i></i> the great speed. The best of both worlds. I think this really illustrates the importance of compilers and of languages like lisp that facilitate their implementation. I never made a low-level compiler and it will be some time before I'm knowledgeable enough to make one but lisp allowed me to make those high-level HTML and CSS compilers comparatively easily.<p>Another important thing is separating policy from mechanism, one obvious problem of the programmer that represented rules directly in code as depicted in the article is that he hard-coded policy into his program, but the thing is that policy is volatile so it really belongs in a config file.<p>I think this somewhat resonates with the quote: ""<i>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</i>"" Except programs themselves often want to read programs for the purpose of analysis or manipulation, hence the advantage of representing the most logic you can in a ""dumb"" language or data format.",1210015076

It's so obviously superior to the Cadillac that a child could tell it's better.<p>I performed an experiment when I read this article, comparing the two cars based on just the pictures. I had read the paragraph after the pictures, about telling good design from bad design, but not the paragraph before, saying that what each model of car was designed for. And I tried to compare the design of the cars based on just the pictures, seriously. At first, I thought that the 911 might be better because it is more aerodynamic, a criterion that it is objectively better at. But then I noticed that the Cadillac has more headlights in the front, which possibly might provide better light. And I saw that the Cadillac seemed to be a convertible, which is more a matter of taste and your goals for a car. I concluded that both cars seemed pretty decent in their own way. Thus, I was surprised to read the claim that the 911 has obviously superior design to the Cadillac.<p>Perhaps Paul Graharm is right about language design, but this failure of his claim to withstand an experiment lessens my confidence that he has examined the evidence <i>before</i> making his conclusion. Though as I am, in my opinion, a good programmer, I certainly hope he that is right, and that languages aimed at good programmers are the ones whose ideas will become popular in time.",1367739962

This can unlock the same kind of creativity as BI is supposed to unlock if a wide enough range of things is defined as ""work in the public interest"" (basically, anything except sit at home and watch TV / browse reddit) and falls under the scheme.<p>There are other advantages (and some disadvantages).

The USSR economy grew <i>faster and more consistently</i> over the entire period of communism than both the US (and other Western) economies, and also faster than the economies of less-well developed countries. However, because it started from a much lower base in the early 20th century, they still hadn't caught up when they finally lost this economic war.<p>Objectively speaking, communism worked better <i>for them</i> than capitalism worked for the West. They lost because they failed to call the US' bluff after both of them had <i>already</i> built up nuclear arsenals so large that any further arms race would have been moot.<p>That doesn't mean communism is universally better. In the direct comparison of West Germany vs. East Germany, which started from a comparable position after WWII, West Germany clearly wins, and many East Germans really did want to leave.<p>Still, this all suggests that you can't ascribe it all to ""communism bad, capitalism good"".",1367738454

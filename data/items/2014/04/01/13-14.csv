We&#x27;re currently looking for full-time software developers and designers.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.\n\n  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don&#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.\n    Recently, I&#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap),\n    Angular.js, QT and of course Ruby.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool tools and machines.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n\n  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,\n    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m a software craftsman on this awesome team.

He found that, though open offices often fostered a symbolic sense of organizational mission, making employees feel like part of a more laid-back, innovative enterprise, they were damaging to the workers’ attention spans, productivity, creative thinking, and satisfaction. Compared with standard offices, employees experienced more uncontrolled interactions, higher levels of stress, and lower levels of concentration and motivation. When David Craig surveyed some thirty-eight thousand workers, he found that interruptions by colleagues were detrimental to productivity, and that the more senior the employee, the worse she fared.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/01/the-open-office-trap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/01/the-o...</a><p>Edited to add: the study by Matthew Davis referenced above is behind a paywall; if anyone can actually access it, I&#x27;d be curious to know for sure if this summary is accurate/correct.",1396360700

7508175,comment,7507280,7507280,6,0,joeldidit,,,"Open floor plans came about originally to fit more people into a space, and to get more work out of them (which it fails at doing, but the idiot management theory is that if an employee is on edge, then they will always be alert and productive due to fear of being seen not doing anything). And beneath it all is the &quot;breaking down of barriers&quot; BS that permeates the business (sales in particular) world. BS that ends up being nothing more than a bunch of needy extroverted people setting things up such that they can constantly yap yap yap all day long to the point that all their needs are met (at the expense of everyone else).<p>People forget that this &quot;keep it lively&quot; (versus not negative, though they try to claim that&#x27;s all it is), &quot;smile and say hi when we cross paths,&quot; &quot;approach me and kiss my ass to make me feel good,&quot; &quot;always be open and approachable and available&quot; (read: always be there when I need something, then when I ask do it blindly and with everything in you so I get what I want, then nod your head acceptingly when I make up some BS excuse when asked to do something as though it was ever about anything other than me ensuring I get everything I want while ensuring you get nothing), and anything else that will avoid insulting me or hurting my feelings nonsense is something out of a Dilbert cartoon and should&#x27;ve been ancient history by now, not promoted as some sort of superior/modern/good approach.<p>I hate open plan offices. The collaboration argument is BS, because I can collaborate just as well when sitting in a cubicle as I would when in an open plan environment. And, as a matter of fact, the cubicle (or some other) setup would probably be better because we could huddle around someone&#x27;s desk as necessary to discuss anything that needs to be discussed, then go our separate ways to work on what needs to get done. All without the constant tension, anxiety, and noise of an open office environment that completely stalls out any ability to think clearly. The only things that really affect collaboration are proximity, and how well the group can collaborate (can they work well together, do they like each other, have they minimized the effect of any idiot managers and divisive employees, etc).<p>I hate cubicles as well, but I love silence, privacy, and the ability to uninterruptedly do my work. And the cubicle set up allows that more than open plan environments. Also, most open plan environments are setup such that everyone can see what you are doing (as in they can stand over your shoulder and blatantly watch for no reason, or can end up doing so unintentionally), and in a way that would leave everyone in a state of paranoia thinking you&#x27;re watching them. Anytime I see something encouraged that heightens fear/anxiety levels like this I start to smell BS. I start thinking that maybe this is exactly what they are up to.<p>Open plan environments are good for those that like annoying or squeezing others, who constantly need attention, who like sitting close to others, and anyone else that needs to discuss every single thing with someone else before they do it (but it&#x27;s really that they have an aversion to thinking, don&#x27;t know what they are doing, and would rather get someone else to do the work (while BSing that they are just being more open and communicative) then take credit anyway). These environments are also great for management, an entity in most companies that&#x27;s always looking for a way to underhandedly (something they can laugh about like they&#x27;re so clever for doing it) squeeze more out of people while making it look like they are giving them what they want, and are so nice for doing it. That is, it amplifies so many negative aspects that any good that it brings is overshadowed, and it seems like nothing more than gimmicky, self-serving, overly hyped, faddish nonsense.",1396360519

I live in Boston, Massachusetts so I know when I apply for a job I am likely going against people with degrees, maybe even some from colleges like MIT and Harvard. That hasn&#x27;t stopped me from applying and has not stopped employers from setting up interviews.<p>Of course especially in a college-filled place like Boston there are employers that will not even look at you without a degree. So having a degree will widen your opportunities and strengthen your job security but at the cost of going to college and time you could be doing other things.<p>My advice is to work on a project that generates some sort of revenue. I think the ability to show that you can make software that creates profit is very valuable. I would hire Jane that drop out of college and earned $10,000 from a SaaS application than Joe who earned a Computer Science degree by googling solutions to his Java homework problems.<p>Fortune favors the prepared mind. So pick up good programming books from the bay and try to read some chapters. It is normal for companies in an interview to test how well you know different data structures and algorithms so if you can&#x27;t learn that type of material on your own, you might need to go to college and let it be forced upon you.<p>Whatever software technologies you are passionate about learn it well and I truly believe in the long run the trendy new popular technology you bet your career on will pay off, you might be 22 before it happens though.<p>I believe in you!",1396360306

The reason was instructive: they felt they could learn more from their\n“officemates” in this kind of office. This makes sense, since in interviews a common\nreason for wanting to join a company was the opportunity to work with “great” people.\nHaving great people around, whom you rarely see and even more rarely talk to, is not of\nreal value. Respondents talked about the much greater learning opportunities in a more\nopen environment. Older respondents, in contrast, found it harder to concentrate and\nmore disruptive. It also seemed the case that older respondents were simply comfortable\nwith how they had learned to do things over a number of years, and did well.</i><p>Hmm, that&#x27;s one interpretation.<p>Here&#x27;s a simpler interpretation.<p>Younger workers generally aren&#x27;t going to know what they&#x27;re doing and need to ask questions, so being able to ask questions is important to them.

Having something with the same economic and legal standings but not called marriage generally seems fine by them.</i><p>The problem, I think, stems from the fact that we have mixed a religious and legal concept into one. I do realize that some people who fight against gay marriage do it with much vitriol and disgust for gay people, but has Mr. Eich done anything more than donated to a political cause he supports? I&#x27;m all for gay marriage, but we unfortunately have a complicated issue that cannot simply be painted as &quot;He hates gay people and wants to deny them their rights&quot; - Why? We don&#x27;t know his true beliefs as he hasn&#x27;t shared them with us, and he hasn&#x27;t demonstrated any further malice.

7507921,comment,7507470,7507574,3,0,nevvvermind,,,"Romania, eh? Well, let me &quot;enlighten&quot; you about this one. Romania IS a tech hub. I don&#x27;t know how much you&#x27;ve been in the field, but the market here exploded some years ago. We&#x27;ve become an outsourcing paradise. Good, cheap work. Demand is pretty high. So don&#x27;t worry - you&#x27;ll get your share. With or without college.<p>Now the not so cool part: just get that degree, one way or the other. Especially if it&#x27;s related to the field you want to work in. The govt has some strategies to facilitate graduates into the work market: as a graduate, your employer pays 16% less taxes for IT graduates. You&#x27;d LOVE the faces of the HR people when they hear you&#x27;re not a IT student/graduate.<p>The above is just one of the more &quot;direct&quot; implications of you having a degree. There are more. As employing goes, the &quot;upper-class&quot; languages (Java, C#, C++) tend to require it. PHP, HTML/CSS, Ruby - not so much.<p>Another advantage is that the employers here voraciously search for IT students and they grab them even from the second year. They invest in degrees, as those <i>at the very least, guarantees them a basic knowledge</i>, on which they can build, as the student is perceived as a long-term investment.<p>Then there&#x27;s the human nuances - future prospects, getting employed outside the country (if you&#x27;re into that), self-perception (if you&#x27;re into that, too).<p>Do you want me to continue?<p>You are passionate, I can respect that. But college is not about passion or destroying it - it&#x27;s about market placing (in Romania at least). Sooner or later, you&#x27;ll think about that. Oh and I heard that IT college can be a blast when it comes to same-minded people. My bet is you&#x27;ll find lots of passionate people in there.<p>I&#x27;m a Romanian ex-&quot;bum&quot; (wanna hang out?), philosophy and maths college drop-out, now a passionate programmer, having a hard time getting into a Java - mainly because of the degree.

7507847,comment,7507470,7507574,3,0,pyduan,,,"Here are two other arguments in favor for college on top of patio11&#x27;s:<p>1) While you may be worried about the <i>depth</i> of the content in your field, be aware that college is also a great way to acquire <i>breadth</i>: this is the best way to be exposed to ideas you wouldn&#x27;t have encountered before, and I&#x27;d encourage you to take courses outside of your field. Economics, philosophy, or  political science come to mind as topics that may not be directly useful to you in your career but do help tremendously in understanding the world around you and being a more complete individual in general. This is also a great time to live and study abroad, which is a great life experience in general. This will also be very useful if you ever decide to branch out and work in a different field, where you may feel your lack of degree much more than in tech.<p>In addition there is nothing wrong with getting &quot;extra coursework&quot; in college. Unlike high school, the goal here is to learn for your own sake and there is always the possibility to dig further if you&#x27;re interested in acquiring highly specialized knowledge.<p>2) A degree is not simply useful for convincing old-school employers. You work in tech, so I assume there is a probability that you may want at some point or the other want to check out the scene in the US. If this is something that interests you, be aware that it is tremendously harder to get a work visa to the US if you don&#x27;t have a higher education degree. Most work visas will require a degree or equivalent work experience; for the US bureau of immigration, &quot;equivalent work experience&quot; generally means 3 years of work for each year of school, which means you won&#x27;t be eligible for a H1B for another decade. I do not know how it is for other countries but I assume many have similar requirements.<p>tl;dr: a degree will allow you to hedge yourself against the future.

7507823,comment,7507470,7507470,1,0,juliogreff,,,"22 yo here, recently dropped out of college. I cannot tell you what to do, but I can tell what difference dropping out made to me.<p>To give some context: I lived in a small city in Southern Brazil, and I&#x27;ve been programming professionally since I was 16. Of course the money and the recognition were close to zero, because who trusts a kid anyway. Self-taught from the beginning, so by the time I got to university at 18 I was always the best programmer in the class, which made almost every class extremely boring. More or less 2 years later I started getting offers from big companies in Brazilian tech hubs like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Moving to another university meant losing almost 1 year worth of studies, so I decided to stay. But at this point I was convinced that I was worth something, and started working remotely for a company in Rio. I was in charge of a whole product, and the pay was ok for Brazilian standards. Since I lived in a small town, I was getting paid more than all my friends, even those that already graduated. I thought that I was on to something.<p>Last year I started working for an American company, and started getting paid a lot more. During the interview process, I wasn&#x27;t even asked about my education, they just asked me to demonstrate what I knew (I understand that this is not universal to every company). This, combined with the fact that I finished all the college subjects that interested me, made me take the decision to drop out and move out of the country. Remote work is fun and all, but I missed the social contact with other people. Berlin was my first choice, and I started applying. I made it clear in every application that I was dropping out, and it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference, because I was getting interviews and ended up getting hired. So professionally dropping out did not hurt me at all, because I had the skills.<p>But not having a degree did make me life difficult. It was absurdly hard to get a work permit. Not impossible, but it required HR to get creative. So you have to be prepared to hit roadblocks every once in a while. I thought of giving up and going back home a few times, because it&#x27;s really frustrating. In the end, everything worked and I&#x27;m more than one year ahead career-wise than if I had stayed and finished my degree.<p>So, should you drop out? Maybe, but be prepared for a slightly harder life overall. If you do decide to drop out, please do it as soon as possible, and don&#x27;t wait a few years like I did. I feel I could be even better today if I had dropped out a year earlier. But YMMV.",1396358078

7507783,comment,7504296,7505834,1,0,waterhouse,,,"I like your call to civility. Your questions seem like they could lead to an interesting conversation in the midst of all this, so I&#x27;ll bite.<p><i>What are the reasons you believe what you do?</i> Interesting question. &quot;What I believe&quot; is a rather broad category, and it would take a long time to answer all of that. Let&#x27;s see what the other answers provoke and come back to this one. --Well, I think I&#x27;ve usually included that in my answers.<p><i>What is the evidence that homosexuality is an in-born quality as opposed to a choice? How strong is it?</i> There is my personal experience that I started being attracted to humans of one sex without consciously deciding to. I gather that this is a common experience for people of all sexual orientations, and I haven&#x27;t heard of exceptions. There is also the logical consideration that if anyone was facing serious negative consequences for being gay and negligible benefits, and he could easily turn straight, then he would probably do it; I don&#x27;t have the literature in my hands, but my impression is that if you look, say, a few decades in the past, you can find a fair number of gay people who (a) faced physical abuse and ostracism, (b) were very distressed by all this, (c) were not getting emotional support from the gay community because it didn&#x27;t really exist yet, (d) could not plausibly be argued to have martyr complexes, and yet didn&#x27;t &quot;just stop being gay&quot;. Seems like strong evidence, though the underlying mechanism remains obscure.<p>That said, though, whether it&#x27;s a choice is really moot in my opinion, and in fact something of a distraction. Orson Scott Card, a believing Mormon, wrote an entire essay where he starts from the premise that homosexual behavior is immoral, because his religion says so, and criticizes those who protest that the desire for it is innate: just because people have innate urges to do many other kinds of immoral behavior (including violence) doesn&#x27;t make them moral. A fine argument <i>if</i> you agree with the premise, which his critics obviously do not. Since the entire point of contention is a matter of faith for him, it seems there is little to discuss with him, and the resulting debate is just awkward and embarrassing for all involved.<p>People have exclusive rights to their own bodies; they can form whatever voluntary sexual, emotional, financial, or other kinds of relationships, as far as I&#x27;m concerned; I would oppose anyone who would try to intervene by force, and would be wary of those who try to use shaming and other forms of social power to discourage it. <i>Why</i> people want what they want doesn&#x27;t enter into this.<p><i>What about concerns that gay people are promiscuous, spreading AIDS and other STD&#x27;s?</i> I don&#x27;t think promiscuity is a problem if you&#x27;re careful not to spread disease; let us use the term &quot;recklessly promiscuous&quot;. Let&#x27;s see. I think the statistics on that are indeed discouraging. What could contribute to this? I&#x27;ve heard anal sex is like the most reliable way to transmit HIV; that could be a factor. Next, I&#x27;ve heard of gay bathhouses where men basically recklessly have sex with each other; what I&#x27;ve heard could be exaggerated, but I think they&#x27;ve probably existed to some extent; that would certainly explain a lot of early spread of AIDS among gay men.<p>Why would gay men in particular do such a thing? Well, perhaps part of it has to do with the average behavior of males; there are reasons to think they would evolve a strategy of promiscuous mating to maximize offspring, and I think young men have a reputation for being reckless. Then there is another effect: When something is made illegal but some people do it anyway, it gets pushed underground; necessarily it all happens outside the eyes of the law, and for all who participate the barrier to entry for other kinds of illegality is reduced. When drugs and prostitution are illegal, you get toxic impurities, dangerous back-alley negotiation, gang violence, pimps, and disease; when they are legal, you get careful manufacturing, department stores, and weekly STD tests. To the extent that gay prostitution and bathhouses are illegal (and I imagine social stigma can have some of the same effects as legal punishments), it is unsurprising that they lack high health standards.<p>Anyway, what <i>about</i> those concerns? The situation is unfortunate. The solution is libertarianism--legalizing prostitution--and to make people in general more prosperous, so they can satisfy their urges less recklessly.<p><i>Is a gay household an unhealthy environment for children?</i> Inherently? I doubt it. The kids won&#x27;t have parental role models for heterosexual adults of either sex. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a problem, though; homosexual role models might do fine, the one deficiency they seem likely to have (not having children) is by assumption out of the picture. Kids might find role models in the adults they meet or those they read about; it seems certainly not a worse problem than that faced by, say, single parents, or families with other problems. And note that it&#x27;s entirely possible for a peaceful single-parent family to be better than a dysfunctional &quot;traditional&quot; family: there are a hundred ways families can be great or screwed up, and if &quot;gay parents&quot; is a factor, I would guess it&#x27;s a small one, almost certainly smaller than &quot;divorce&quot;.<p><i>To what extent is homosexuality associated with crimes like rape and pedophilia?</i> I haven&#x27;t heard anything about this. If there&#x27;s a small link, my first guess is to attribute it to social deviancy: if you&#x27;re already stigmatized and pushed into association with other stigmatized people, the barrier to entry for other kinds of deviant behavior, some of which may be criminal, is reduced. Then it&#x27;s plausible that pedophiles attracted to kids of the same sex are more likely to be gay. If there is a significant link that has nothing to do with the above, I&#x27;d be somewhat interested to see it.<p>(&quot;Somewhat interested&quot;: if so, so what? Let&#x27;s suppose childhood abuse of various sorts, the same kind that often causes people to become violent criminals, also often causes people to become gay, and therefore we observe a significant association. What then? Is the solution to outlaw gay behavior? [You bring this up in a &quot;pro&quot; vs &quot;anti&quot; gay rights debate, so I can only assume.] That seems mind-bogglingly stupid and counterproductive. Solution would obviously then be to try to reduce childhood abuse.)<p><i>Why is homosexuality traditionally considered morally wrong (e.g. Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible), a symbol of decline (e.g. the late Roman Empire), and even outlawed? If the millenia-old traditional viewpoint was wrong, why did it last so long?</i> I&#x27;m not so sure this &quot;tradition&quot; is universal. Observe the Greeks, particularly those of Socrates&#x27;s time. From what I&#x27;ve heard, pederasty was considered great, and openly indulged in by many men who were considered great. I think they&#x27;re not the only culture that was like this, although they probably are outnumbered by gay-hostile cultures.<p>The examples you cite appear to all come from Judaism and Christianity. Being a band of people who had to work hard to make their way, the Jews could easily see homosexual behavior (which cannot lead to children) as unproductive; the story of Onan is an injunction against refusing to father children when God willed it; an injunction against a non-reproductive lifestyle (ignoring adoption and reproduction-outside-marriage) seems not much of a stretch. So there&#x27;s a possible religion-based reason. Next, I could make up reasons to do with masculinity: let&#x27;s say a strong man is dominant, can only express sexuality through dominance, and it&#x27;s impossible for both men in a relationship to be dominant over each other. Therefore in gay relationships, at least one man is weak, and is a safe target for bullying. (As a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve heard that in some cases of male-on-male rape, the &quot;top&quot; isn&#x27;t considered gay, but the &quot;bottom&quot; is a gay sissy, despite the irony. The point, of course, is that the weak one is to be bullied.) The crowd gets habituated to bullying gays, and this can become enshrined in law.<p>As for being a symbol of decline: Well, if any behavior X is frowned upon and outlawed, and then society becomes chaotic and the law becomes weak to the point where people engage in X with impunity, then X can become a symbol of the decline, even if X is harmless or mildly beneficial. It might suggest these people have a good reason for frowning upon X, but I have examined that elsewhere.<p><i>Were the anti-gay-rights people always wrong, or has technology changed the picture (e.g. maybe STD&#x27;s are now less serious due to inventions like condoms and antibiotics)?</i> Or STD tests and general knowledge. Um... is it permissible to outlaw a behavior because many people are doing it recklessly and infecting others? How about outlawing infecting others? I guess it&#x27;s usually too much to expect that kind of precision from the law. But AIDS is a very recent development; I haven&#x27;t heard of homosexuality being associated with disease before the modern era. If it is, I&#x27;d refer to my previous comments on illegality, prostitution, and health standards.<p><i>Why do so many pro-gay-rights people try to advance their agenda by calling names and boycotting organizations, instead of simply patiently explaining their side of the story?</i> I&#x27;d guess that they enjoy siccing the power of an angry mob on people, especially if they think they&#x27;re justified in doing so. This may also be how they gain status in their social group.",1396357838

Getting your foot in the door is going to be harder at first because you&#x27;re young and you have no degree, but it seems you&#x27;ve worked at multiple places already. Get references from them, have them talk to your future employer on the phone. This is the strongest vote of confidence one can get and definitely matters more than a degree.<p>Make sure each new job you take progresses in some way: More responsibility, higher rank, more / different tech, more complicated project. For each job, keep track of your accomplishments on the job as easy to digest one-liners. Put these in your resume. Your resume items and progression should tell a clear story that you&#x27;re good (which is easy since you started so young) and you&#x27;re getting even better.<p>In addition, show that you&#x27;re not purely a cog. If you can reflect the fact that you also understand the business aspects and reason <i>why</i> you do things, that you can course-correct misguided top down policies from management, that you can serve not only as techie but also, say, marketer, that you can communicate with non-technicals, then that makes you doubly valuable.<p>Also, show that you have expertise. Go to conferences, be a regular in local user groups, speak in front of people, teach people.<p>Four years of progressing employment, combined with these bonuses should really negate the fact that you don&#x27;t have a degree in terms of getting hired (I think degree is valuable for other reasons, but let&#x27;s put that aside for now). The one exception is large employers like Google, MS, the Government, etc. which sometimes have hard HR requirements and just cannot comprehend bending them even if they like you. But anyway, I recommend that people with degrees try to do all this too. It really builds the idea of investing in you as a valuable asset and a person rather than buying a replaceable cog. Value-add matters.",1396357592

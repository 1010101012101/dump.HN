3130947,comment,3130733,3130733,3,0,kposehn,,,"Hi Manuel,<p>Speaking as a long-time affiliate (for better or worse), I'm glad to see you release this in the wild!<p>So, with that in mind, here's my thoughts:<p>1. Overall, I like your concept of making a powerful turnkey storefront for affiliates. I especially like your outsource-ready concept. However, there are tons of others across the world, and many of them are working the work-from-home-churn-and-burn scam and have a hell of a lot of money to burn.<p>2. A big difficulty is going to be content and keeping the storefronts valuable. You see, with SEO and PPC, you generally need to have a fairly unique site with some different content. Google will heavily penalize sites that are recycled data or affiliate links with little to no information in them. A good example is this HN post: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3099875"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3099875</a><p>Matt Cutts weighed in on this and his feedback was quite clear to that affiliate: ""You have an autogenerated web site that consists of practically nothing other than affiliate links to Amazon. You can make an infinite number of autogenerated pages on your site and each autogenerated page consists of literally hundreds of affiliate links stuffed with keywords for unrelated products.""<p>Remember that for search and PPC, the lifeblood of 99% of affiliates out there, content is king. You need to provide many ways for them to do this and site maps, tags and clean code don't go that far.<p>3. You're going to face serious competition from the very established combo of Wordpress.com + Skimlinks. It is very easy to make a content-heavy affiliate site using that combo, as blogging is fairly simple and Skimlinks makes the monetization almost instant. If you want to hit those guys, really work on some content tools for affiliates. Writing product descriptions really isn't enough and reviews have to be really verbose to get ranked, so the more tools you provide for that, the better.<p>With all this in mind, do you have a winner here? Not yet, but you <i>are</i> on to something. Really refine your product and add some core tools. I think you'd be best served by making a solution akin to WP+Skimlinks, but look more at what your users want because it is only my opinion :)",1319043057

Most of the Xers and (especially) later didn't work their asses off.  They worked at the grocery store in high school, not to help support their families, but to pay for gas in vehicles that they didn't really need that their parents bought them.  We're two spoiled generations.<p>> <i>I would argue that ""X"" hasn't ended. I was born in 1983 and I don't feel much of a generational separation between myself (1983) and people 10 years older. But I think there's a huge separation between people born in 1945 vs. '55, and also '55 vs. '65. This came into the clear at my wedding, when I could sense ""generational sameness"" in conversations among people of radically different ages (from 3 to 84). I feel like I'm ""the same age"" as people who are 23 (18's different, but that's because of inexperience) or 38, but age 55 and 65 are (generationally speaking) very different, even now.</i><p>That's because you're in the middle of that age range.  When you're around 30, someone 10 years older isn't really in a drastically different place in life.  They work jobs, they have kids at home, they live in fairly nice houses (they might even still be paying student loans).  Day to day there's very little different.  Ditto for 23-year-olds.  They are out of college and working a job, a few of them are having kids.  They're at an earlier level of career development, but not by that much.  You were there very recently.<p>On the other hand, you look at 18-year-olds and they seem stupid, because they are (so were we at that age).  And they're just starting college.  You can't really relate to that any more.  You look at 50-year-olds, and they've got kids in college.  And they're managers at work now.  And the age gap is large enough that it doesn't disappear into the background.  But there is no real generational divide.  It's a continuum.  Sure, you feel like you can relate to 23-year-olds and 40-year-olds.  You could date someone in either of those age buckets and it's not really weird.  The 40-year-old probably feels a lot more ""generational divide"" talking to a 23-year-old than you do.  The 40-year-old could be the parent of the 23-year-old.",1319042889

It's quite common for ordinary users to either not know that their data is being collected and used in those ways, or the extent of the data which is being collected (e.g. Location, Phone Identifiers, and sites visited across the web).<p>For another, opting out is generally designed to be quite difficult.

Photography has now been around for over 150 years. Sound movies are close to 100. Videos of average Joe and his family are coming up on 40 or 50 years.<p>What does that mean? It means that instead of just hearing stories from dad and gradnpop, we have pretty immediate access to several generations -- and we can hear them in their own words, when they were young. Not some kind of age-filtered reminiscence.<p>And guess what? All of them felt like they were the first to discover sex, or drugs, or protesting, or making a world a better place, or empowering the common man -- the list of commonalities goes on and on.

Unlike Apple, which apparently eschews formal user research, Google relied on ""ethnographic research"" to shape Android 4.0.<p>I definitely think this idea has began to take a life of its own so to speak. I've read that Apple doesn't do Usability testing, doesn't do market research or user research. All of the points can be summed up with the ""Apple knows best"" idea. But, I'm sure Apple does user research - just not with a consultancy, or by asking users what they want. They focus on users' behaviour and their needs and incorporate it into their vision.<p>I don't think Google's core approach this time around is that much different from (what I presume is) Apple's approach. Google is using their ethnographic research to figure out what users do and what users need. I'd wager that Apple's own 'research' has focused on that all along.",1319040228

Things like ioctl() calls, OpenGL/DirectX, and so on. Misusing these (or just encountering bugs in them) can pretty easily trash your application -- and sometimes even your kernel -- in really messy ways.<p>OK, but that&#x27;s why glium is so popular (quite possibly the preferred OpenGL binding in the community nowadays?), which has very low overhead while maintaining OpenGL safety.<p>ioctls have similar wrappers for the important ones.",1444280303

No one in my entire family tree has ever graduated high school, so I&#x27;ve never had any encouragement or mentoring for CS. I ended up in a very average university: is not in top 100 of USNews. It&#x27;s top 20 in Northeast.<p>In the school&#x27;s job fairs, we get only local, unknown companies (like 3 of them). Problem is I don&#x27;t live locally there, and they only hire locals and don&#x27;t assist with relocation. I&#x27;ve applied elsewhere, but yeah... I&#x27;m unemployed after 5 months.<p>I&#x27;ve had my resume checked by multiple sources, and no one&#x27;s had any problem with it. My non-school projects consist of websites. They&#x27;re not exciting with no &quot;xTreme-Framework-of-the-month&quot;, but I&#x27;m working on updating and integrating new features. I&#x27;ve also volunteered my programming skills and worked for an unpaid internship. I also have some related extracurricular.<p>Clarification: I have received many phone calls from unknown companies; zero on-sites. The problem is I can&#x27;t get past the phone calls since they always ask me exclusive, tricky questions about their stack. I never get any algorithm or data structure questions like I hear in other threads.<p>My big problem is since no one in my family has an education and sees the CS degree as &quot;a worthless piece of paper&quot;, they don&#x27;t want my sister to go to university.<p>So, I really don&#x27;t know how to find a job. I&#x27;ve tried the blackhole websites (e.g., dice.com); multiple 3rd party recruiters; school&#x27;s job board (at this second, literally only has one position posted for software engineer); my neighbors and family&#x27;s friends.

It assumes that the judgment to hire is on merit.<p>The assumption behind affirmative action is different; it&#x27;s that the judgment has been based on race and gender, and on the network of those in power (which, due to prior discrimination, is of one race and gender). I think that is much more realistic than the meritocratic model:<p>* If there wasn&#x27;t discrimination, why would 33% of the population (white males) still hold the great majority of power, wealth and opportunity. Certainly we know discrimination has been widespread and still is in many places.<p>* We all know that &#x27;who you know&#x27; and networking is far more important than &#x27;what you know&#x27; when it comes to getting jobs, business deals, getting into college (consider children alumni and big donors), etc. The current network, due to historical and current discrimination, is mostly white males.<p>On that basis, choosing the best minority options improves quality. For a simple but imperfect example, think of the integration of baseball: Before 1947, black and Latino players weren&#x27;t allowed to play in the Major Leagues.[1] At that point, if you hired the best excluded players based simply on the fact that they were excluded, would you improve your team? Certainly; there were Hall of Fame level players that were excluded, and the players they would replace, the ones you would fire, would be the guys at the bottom of your roster who would have been minor-leaguers if not for the discrimination.<p>[1] And after 1947, it took 20 years or more before the opportunity to play was equal. At the end of 1947 only 2 non-white players played. It took until 1959 for the last two teams to integrate. From what I&#x27;ve read, if you were black and hit like an all-star then you could find a job. If you were an average hitter, they would take the white guy.",1444279867

I don&#x27;t like it very much and many others in my community don&#x27;t like either, but we&#x27;re all stuck in this local maximum.<p>Moving to an entirely new language is impractical for any single project so all the new projects end up using C++ which in turn means the projects that come after them ending up using C++ as well. For a concrete example, look at something like ABC (<a href=""https://bitbucket.org/alanmi/abc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/alanmi/abc</a>). There is very little incentive to rewrite the whole thing in a safe language but if you&#x27;re doing new circuit verification research having ABC&#x27;s humongous library of transformations and verification algorithms will be a huge help in implementing new things.<p>There have been a few attempts to break away though. Some folks at SRI wrote the model checker SAL in Ocaml, a lot of CMU folks seem to like Ocaml too: for example the bitblaze project uses Ocaml.

Sometimes (more commonly a couple hundred years ago) the word also means “at the current moment.”<p>“Oblige” and “obligate” still have different sets of connotations, but I really don’t think your case is very strong here, since their main overlapping senses, in which they’re roughly interchangeable, have been in common use for several centuries, perhaps since the words first arose.

Could be a great suggestion. Could be a poor one. That depends on a lot of things.<p>For example, not using natural keys. Same as above.<p>For example, Enum over Varchar. Same story again.<p>A lot of these are 100% harmless if your table has 1000 rows. But, honestly, if your table has 1000 rows you'll get good performance from MySQL no matter what you do.<p>But take the Enum suggestion. Seems safe, right? But adding a value to an enum field forces a table rebuild. That's a blocking operation. And it could take quite a while on a big table.<p>Also, it will change the way your data is sorted. Enums are sorted by their position in the enumeration, not alphabetically.<p>So on, So Forth.<p>The guys at percona and MySql performance blog are super informative. Spend some time there. You'll learn tons.<p>And we've been using their storage engine in production on a write-intensive system for a year now and love it. Check it out.",1261402216

At my school, only students who stayed in the AP track from freshman year onwards were able to take the ""AP"" class, effectively making the AP requirement 4 years long. It was purely necessary: by 9th grade you know a little French, but the intensive vocabulary building, then reading simple books (The Little Prince), then graduating to proper literature and poetry -- it takes time to build up to that level. The program was hard but well worth it: the entire AP class (9 in total, starting from 30) came away with 4s and 5s.

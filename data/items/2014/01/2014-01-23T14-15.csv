Windows has always been a mess, long, long, long before CLR/.Net.  The phrase &quot;just work&quot; came from the macintosh world, to contrast the experience you&#x27;d get on a mac versus the mess you had in the windows world with even the most trivial hardware devices (plug & pray) or apps (dll hell).  I don&#x27;t know where he got the idea that DOS apps &quot;just worked&quot; on windows -- MS spent a lot of money and effort getting the big apps to work when running on/in windows, but that effort really only helped with the big apps.  Lotus 1-2-3 worked, but many apps wouldn&#x27;t without setting up DOS-box settings.<p>But, let&#x27;s put all that away.  Everyone&#x27;s guilty of looking at the past through rose-colored lenses.  OWL was actually quite nice.  MS&#x27;s response, MFC, was an awful bare-thin wrapper over the windows API -- and that pig needed a lot more lipstick.  MS was right to dump it.  The problem was, looking from in from the outside, MS had too many cooks in too many kitchens, trying to do everything as fast as possible.  In response, documentation was always pretty bad (there was lots of it, but the quality&#x27;s pretty low), the APIs were rarely clear or straightforward, and you ended up single-stepping your debugger to figure out what the APIs really did.<p>Frankly, I think the APIs were always awful enough to warrant fixing, but they were never organized enough to do the real work in fixing it.  It&#x27;s not something you can grunt through, it requires a cohesive set of patterns, abstractions, mechanisms, and conventions.  That kind of agreement just doesn&#x27;t seem possible over such a large and contentious organization.",1390489008

I find that most people&#x27;s thinking about stories like these latches immediately to whatever makes the most sense as a story. &quot;Snowden is a hero who was driven to leak exactly the right information by a system that was utterly disinterested in abuse reports and who will now lead the charge to abolish the NSA&quot;. Fiction. &quot;Snowden is an agent of the shadow Soviet government who was charged with infiltrating the US government so he could help sabotage the world&#x27;s last remaining superpower.&quot; Fiction.<p>Reality is almost always messy and incomprehensible.

This makes it kind of a pain to javascript devs who are not used to this sort of thing.<p>Coming from Java, I probably found it a little less annoying than most javascript devs. Although in Java (as I mentioned in a footnote) you have really powerful and mature tooling like Eclipse, which--whatever else you think of it--does really help with Java&#x27;s general verbosity.

I showed her everything I had, passport, taxes, etc. yet she wouldn&#x27;t relent and I couldn&#x27;t figure out any way to protest it. At first it didn&#x27;t really matter, until I got a letter from my bank that my car insurance was issued through, that I was Mohandas now, so far as they were concerned.<p>Then, when I went to get a license in my new state, they also insisted, though they were much more polite about it and raised the issue up to supervisors, etc. In the end they sent me to get a current copy of my social security card, which didn&#x27;t have Mohandas written on it. When I arrived at the SSA...they balked at the difference and issued me a new card with Mohandas in first, and my 3rd name dropped completely. That sealed the deal at the DMV, so now my social security number, my license, my bank statements, utilities, etc. are all issued to &quot;Mohandas&quot; which isn&#x27;t an identity I have any connection to.<p>Sorry for the rant, it&#x27;s just been a frustrating, strange couple years as I&#x27;ve watched my lifelong identity transform out of my control.<p>EDIT: Would also like to add that in the scope of the article and the very real suffering this issue is causing an already embattled minority, my issue is absolutely not comparable.",1390485935

Good luck telling a bunch of steel workers that they&#x27;re going to have to put in an extra 30 minutes, much less a 48-hour marathon and not get paid.<p>* Professional engineer is a licensed profession as opposed to technology where it&#x27;s often an entry-level title that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean anything.<p>I haven&#x27;t met a professional engineer who didn&#x27;t have some respect for and ability around process, planning and documentation. All of which are things which go a long way toward setting expectations and building / maintaining realistic schedules and fixing problems as they arise.<p>Meanwhile. we&#x27;ve all met software, network or systems &quot;engineers&quot; and had to support the code/infrastructure of people who were happy to just &quot;make it work&quot; and move on.<p>(Yes, yes, this is certainly arguable - I used to argue it against the professional engineers I supported all the time.)<p>* Software development tends wander much closer to the bleeding the edge than do other forms of engineering.

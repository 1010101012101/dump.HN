9715298,comment,9711367,9712418,0,0,ngrilly,,,"I agree with you that the lack of generics is a weakness of Go. Even Rob Pike agrees [1]. But some of your arguments are just plain wrong:<p>- `go generate` was never designed as a way to bring generics to Go.<p>- Most Go programmers are not &quot;ignorant of basic functional programming&quot;. They use FP in other languages, and even in Go which has first-class functions, higher-order functions and closures. But it&#x27;s true that the lack of generics severely limits the usage of FP techniques in Go.<p>- Go partisans don&#x27;t &quot;recommend&quot; to stuff everything in interface{} and use &quot;blind&quot; type assertions everywhere. They even recommend the contrary. Give me a link to the Go official documentation that recommends that and I&#x27;ll revisit my position.<p>To be clear, just like you, I sometimes miss generics in Go, especially when I&#x27;d like to use some FP techniques. But for me, it&#x27;s just an inconvenience. It sounds like for you it&#x27;s a showstopper and I understand that. But I don&#x27;t think that using words like &quot;junk&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; helps in making your point.<p>I hope, and I&#x27;m confident, that the Go team will find a way to add some form or type parametricity that fits well with the overall language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.golang.org/slices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.golang.org/slices</a>",1434297125
9715297,comment,9714323,9714323,0,0,zbuf,,,"You post is very broad but I understand the core question you&#x27;re asking. I have done some work with a streaming servers in the past on BSD and Linux and, whilst my knowledge could be dated, I&#x27;m currently sitting at home with a cold so let me share information that might be helpful.<p>Last I checked it&#x27;s true that on Linux there is no non-blocking API for disk I/O, and that read(), write() or accessing mmap() pages has no option but to pause the process in &#x27;D&#x27; state. Network I/O is non-blocking, with lots of options around epoll() for edge or level-triggered, so no worries there.<p>So if you are going to write a fully event-driven/co-routine program that streams from disk and out of a network, you&#x27;ll need to work with some options to do the disk I/O while the process continues to run.<p>There are some ways you can leave the main thread/process non-blocking and use several worker threads or processes doing disk I/O.<p>You can hand control of the socket descriptor to the worker thread for sendfile() which is likely to be simplest to develop and fastest if your application suits it.<p>Alternatively you can totally abstract away the I/O by having worker threads sendfile() data down a pipe, ready for splice() by the main event driven threads. Effectively the pipe descriptor now becomes your &#x27;async&#x27; disk I/O, and you can probably write your own nice API to it. This becomes effective if your main thread needs to do some nasty things like inserting extra data within the stream.<p>If you&#x27;re doing anything more than pure data movement then the main thread may be CPU bound, in which case a useful solution is to fork() a process per-CPU all of which are running accept() on the same socket. This assigns a client to a process on connection, and is a lovely cheap way to get nice concurrency for very little development.<p>Once you do have multiple forks, you may find that by having a few threads per-CPU and combining non-blocking network I/O with  blocking (sync) disk I/O is valid for your task; this will do good to minimise the &quot;average&quot; responsiveness of the server, but not the &quot;worse case&quot; responsiveness.<p>In some practical cases, you may be able to use a combination of mmap(), posix_madvise() and mincore() as a poor man&#x27;s solution to despatching lots of I/O into the kernel&#x27;s I/O scheduler from one process. But this comes with little guarantees, and there&#x27;s no way to be woken when the data is &#x27;ready&#x27;.<p>The suggestion to use a thread per client may be valid today, I don&#x27;t know. But threads have previously been a heavyweight solution (if most are to be idle at any one time, waiting on some I/O). Certainly it didn&#x27;t used to be advisable to use, eg. 100,000 threads because of the memory that takes up. Whereas these sorts of numbers can easily be accommodated using the methods above.<p>If the number of clients is small and they are all independent, then I would consider using a process per-thread for the additional crash protection it gives (over threads).<p>In general, I have seen such applications more as a &#x27;broker&#x27; which spends most of its time idle while it waits for data from either the disk or network end.<p>Oh, and maybe libaio will help, though I have not used this myself. It aims to be an async disk I/O API, but IIRC its implementation on Linux was as some form of worker threads.<p>I believe a good reference for this is: <a href=""http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html</a>.

It is not true when, for example, a Chinese* worker (who works 14 hours a day 6 days a week, eats in the company mess hall, and lives in a company dorm) makes a product that is sold in the US.<p>The Chinese government doesn&#x27;t protect these workers against overtime and similar abuses, so these workers receive very little for their labor.

From the article:<p>> Consider any English word with an apostrophe, e.g. <i>“don’t”</i>. The word “don’t” is a single word. It is not the word “don” juxtaposed against the word “t”. The apostrophe is part of the word, which, in Unicode-speak, means it’s a <i>modifier letter</i>, not a <i>punctuation mark</i>, regardless of what colloquial English calls it.<p>> According to the Unicode character database, U+2019 is a punctuation mark (General Category = Pf), while U+02BC is a modifier letter (General Category = Lm). Since English apostrophes are part of the words they’re in, they are modifier letters, and hence should be represented by U+02BC, not U+2019.<p>> (It would be different if we were talking about French. In French, I think it makes more sense to consider «L’Homme» as two words, or «jusqu’ici» as two words. But that’s a conversation for another time.

In the sentence &quot;That man&#x27;s pants are on fire!&quot;, this is usually considered a single word, the genitive case of &quot;man&quot; (personally, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of that approach, since the &quot;genitive&quot; &#x27;s attaches to phrases, not to words, but it is the mainstream position in linguistics).<p>In the sentence &quot;That man&#x27;s about to jump&quot;, on the other hand, the &quot;word&quot; &quot;man&#x27;s&quot; is two words joined by an apostrophe, exactly as in French &quot;l&#x27;homme&quot;. These clitics aren&#x27;t exactly rare in English.

My personal software designs tend to use single components for single functions, so the additional complexities of an IDE&#x27;s second compiler, second build tool, second VCS front end are less than appealing to me. That said, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use in the last 24 hours out of code refactoring the the IntelliJ debugger, so I think the honest answer is to use both approaches if you like.",1434294912

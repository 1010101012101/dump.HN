7780749,comment,7779100,7780630,2,0,panorama,,,"This is largely incorrect. NLHE can be more about &quot;bluffing&quot; because there&#x27;s greater variability between ones chance of winning a hand and the potential bet size. But it still comes down to a mathematical decision, just that it&#x27;s more difficult to accurately calculate the best play given the wide range of variables: your opponent&#x27;s likely holdings, the bet size, the pot size, your hand.<p>In Fixed Limit, the bet size and pot size are all controlled and can be pre-determined, leaving fewer permutations to solve. It&#x27;s easy to calculate that if a bet is a constant,  then you can profitably call with holdings from XY and &quot;higher&quot; in a given situation, but it obviously gets harder when the bet size can vary greatly.<p>To answer OP, Fixed Limit is considered solved (or close to it? Haven&#x27;t been following the news on this) from a mathematical and game theory perspective, and so AIs have been built to play game theory optimally. NLHE is still far, far from being solved, but there are bots that have been created to churn out small, albeit automatic, wages short-stacking (to mitigate bet-size variability) smaller stakes games where its tendencies aren&#x27;t as openly exploited.<p>Poker is very much a mathematical game. And physical tells, reaction-time tells online are pretty insignificant in the longrun.",1400705998

I don&#x27;t use/recommend Clojurescript outside a Clojure shop because frontend skillset+clojure is extremely rare and you do have to do everything yourself.<p>If you have a Backbone app, replacing your Backbone views with React is a pretty substantial win. The Backbone app structure works best if you can just listen for a change event and run your model through template code and slap it into the DOM but that gets complicated if you want to nest views, the DOM you&#x27;re replacing has state, or you have something like jQuery UI widgets. All these issues simply go away if your view code is React and everything just works. I don&#x27;t find the Backbone abstractions too useful so I&#x27;ve only done this personally when consulting and wanting to make the minimal set of changes to the codebase.<p>I was using Angular for two years before I switched over to React. React basically replaces directives and for that use it&#x27;s simpler, composes just as well, and scales better for both data size and dom node count. Replace the Angular DI stuff with browserify/webpack and Jest and there&#x27;s not that much left. The main reason to use Angular would be if you want to take advantage of the Angular ecosystem or if you plan on focusing mainly on directives to support a bunch of designers since non-directive Angular is super simple.<p>For other stuff, the main benefit in a two way databinding framework (or virtual DOM diffing) is that you can isolate your business logic from the DOM. That&#x27;s the major win and everything else is pretty much taste. The React approach results in the least amount of state in my code by a fairly significant margin so I consider it the best but having different preferences is completely reasonable.",1400705661

What you&#x27;ve been saying is exactly how it works in Common Lisp.<p>Again, I do appreciate you explaining the specifics here, so let me just ramble why I think you&#x27;re right and I still think &quot;Lisp has no syntax&quot;.  I did not take a Compilers course, but I call em like I see em.  <i>proceed at your own boredom</i><p>I guess my real problem is that I can&#x27;t write down the line between syntax in Lisp and semantics.  Many things are mere consequences of particular implementations, so I&#x27;ll just list 3 scenarios.<p>SBCL could, <i>ostensibly</i>, update IF to be a compiler macro (defined with, say, COND).  Gasp, I know.  Would that break any code?  Or would it just break the ANSI standard?  Speed aside, how much does it matter?<p>SBCL could also change IF so the true & false parts are swapped.  A criminally stupid move, sure.  Then it&#x27;s definitely not Common Lisp anymore.  They&#x27;d&#x27;ve changed the <i>calling convention</i>.  Note that the lexer wouldn&#x27;t change at all, just the parser (pretend there&#x27;s a separate lexer/parser, even though popular Lisps are all self-hosting).  This seems to me a change in semantics, though I understand why one might argue it&#x27;s a change in <i>syntax</i>.<p>SBCL could also do a third stupid thing: change IF so the test-case is wrapped with square braces, like (if [> 2 3] x y).  This would be a major change, of course, and it wouldn&#x27;t be Common Lisp.  But the reader could be rewritten to handle the new characters and all the source code could be changed.  This would definitely change the syntax.  Note that the lexer needs tweaking, but the parser remains exactly the same (you don&#x27;t even need new tokens).<p>If the syntax changes, the lexer changes.  If the semantics change, the parser changes.  The interface between the lexer and the parser is the List.  Presumably, one could write a Lisp program in & a runtime for JSON lists instead of sexp lists, but I fail to see the benefit.  Sexps are nearly the Ur-language for lists, unless you aren&#x27;t trying to be a subset of ASCII (e.g. binary encodings).  C-style arrays are no fun:<p><pre><code>    ----main.lisp\n    {&quot;defun&quot;, &quot;factorial&quot;, {&quot;n&quot;}, \n        {&quot;if&quot;, {&quot;>&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, 0&quot;},\n            {&quot;*&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, etc},\n            {etc}}}\n</code></pre>\nWhat a terrible syntax on such a beautiful semantics.<p>Anyhow I&#x27;ve been thinking about Lisp a lot today, and now my brain is kinda tired, so I&#x27;m going to go take my dogs for a walk.

This offsets that perceived benefit in terms of developer time.<p>You could argue that it&#x27;s good to spend this extra time because it makes your site more scalable. But if you ever reach the scale &quot;the App Engine way&quot; becomes relevant at, you are likely paying an order of magnitude more than you would if you bought dedicated servers. For all smaller cases, you are prematurely optimizing for scalability.<p>App Engine&#x27;s reliability is easily overstated. App Engine has had a long history of issues with their services like datastore. When datastore does not function, there isn&#x27;t any reasonable way to build a backup storage system because the platform is so restrictive. Frankly, backup services are cheap, and there are plenty of hosted database services if that&#x27;s all you need. Ones which don&#x27;t lock you in forever.<p>So, yeah, sites built on App Engine do go down for various reasons and still have to be monitored just like anything else. Except that you can&#x27;t use any of the usual tools because the platform is completely unique and the underlying software is proprietary and completely secret to you as a platform user.<p>App Engine apps realistically only run on Google&#x27;s servers. So even in the best case, you must have a lot of pure faith in Google. Because if you have reliability problems, problems with the platform&#x27;s restrictions, problems with the terrible support or if the price skyrockets again, or if the platform gets wound down... you will be absolutely forced to rewrite your whole project to move it off of App Engine.

(For instance, they use the word &quot;unprecedented&quot; without really saying what makes Arrakis different from previous exokernel-like designs.) I&#x27;ll try to summarize what I got out of skimming the paper[1]:<p>When you have multiple applications running on the same machine, you need some way to safely share resources between them; for example, incoming network packets are a resource. A kernel handles this by keeping a data structure mapping sockets to processes, and demultiplexing data that comes in from the network card. Hypervisors work the same way, except at the level of virtual machines rather than processes.<p>Arrakis does the same thing, but relies on hardware support in the network card to dispatch packets to the right process. This relies on a standard called SR-IOV[2] which allows the OS to configure a PCI device to present itself as multiple virtual subdevices. The kernel programs the NIC to dispatch packets to different buffers depending on the incoming MAC address; after that, packets can be dispatched with no kernel involvement at all. Similarly, you can tell a disk controller to present a particular extent of a disk as a new virtual storage device.<p>The blurb about memory protection seems to be a red herring, because as far as I can see they haven&#x27;t done anything to change that. There&#x27;s still a kernel, which handles requests for resource mappings, and processes are still isolated from each other. But once they&#x27;ve requested the mappings that they need, the normal execution path doesn&#x27;t involve any syscalls, and so there&#x27;s no kernel overhead. The real contribution of the paper is designing an API around this idea and proving that real applications like Redis can be ported to it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arrakis.cs.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/arrakis-tr-ver2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arrakis.cs.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://blog.scottlowe.org/2009/12/02/what-is-sr-iov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.scottlowe.org/2009/12/02/what-is-sr-iov/</a>",1400704984

Private banking enterprises within Switzerland have provided tax haven services for U.S. and European capital for many years, beginning in the post-WWI period when tax competition was minimal. The 1920s and 1930s were halcyon days for global capital fleeing the warring nations. Switzerland had a lightweight and liberal government, and banks had an appetite for alien capital when few others did.<p>Quoting Farquet 2012:<p>In a subordinate position before the war, notably with regard to the competition of France and Germany, Swiss bankers took advantage of the new international context to affirm themselves as figures of substance in the financial world at the beginning of the 1920s. Although, for example, the cumulative balance sheets of the major Swiss banks represented only 26% of those of their French counterparts in 1913, they subsequently amounted to 73% in 1929.<p>The Swiss financial centre was particularly renowned in the sector of cross-border wealth management. In fact, foreign capital flowed en masse towards the Swiss haven in the interwar years. According to a [League of Nations] report, owing to the importance of foreign assets, in 1929, Switzerland possessed by far the highest per capita total of bank deposits in the world. The lack of a reliable balance of payments, as much as the absence of the legal obligation for Swiss banks to publish details regarding their accounts, nevertheless prevent an exact estimate of the total amount of imported capital. Banking balance sheets indicate a general trend, but are inadequate sources.<p>A committee of experts working on Swiss history during World War II who, exceptionally, had access to the in-house archives of the banks, showed that holdings of securities, generally in off-balance-sheet bank custody accounts, represented, in the two biggest Swiss banks in 1931, more than three times their balance-sheet.<p>[<a href=""http://www.ehes.org/EHES_No27.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ehes.org/EHES_No27.pdf</a>]<p>End quotation.<p>Needless to say, the confiscatory tax rates in the U.S. during the late 50s and 60s made going after Swiss accounts attractive. But the Swiss were having none of it.<p>So are the two situations you mention genuinely at opposite spectrums? Or is Switzerland&#x27;s special brand the product of a persistently muscular political consensus that, after more than fifty years, may now be flagging?

Indulge me for a minute while I try to formulate what they might say in response: most of the complexity of an OS is device drivers.<p>You&#x27;re right, the basics of process isolation, scheduling, and resource allocation are pretty dull.<p>Maybe the UW project makes the move to userspace official? At 1,000,000 packets per second it is more efficient to put the whole network stack in userspace. Assume similar gains can be had for all types of hardware, and shared libraries eliminate the overhead of loading the whole network stack every time you run &#x27;ping&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s just a 30-second pitch for the idea. Userspace is not new (see: Mach). I think what is changing is the average lifetime of each process. Both desktops and servers are beginning to become a commodity to the point where the old reasons for not using a microkernel are starting to become irrelevant: e.g. message passing cost isn&#x27;t as much of a problem if the file server runs &#x27;smbd&#x27; 99% of the time and that is the only really performance-sensitive application. Likewise for a desktop, except the running process is &#x27;Chrome&#x27;, or for a tablet running &#x27;dalvikvm&#x27;.<p>Really it&#x27;s a move away from code complexity that wasn&#x27;t possible before but is becoming possible.",1400704588

This is as good an example as any on the phenomenon you mentioned, and it&#x27;s a good topic we all remember and may have been convinced by. My parents and I have already had a discussion about it, where they were convinced that marijuana was much worse than believed, and I remained open to the idea that there may be merit to the study they heard about. But this is an article many people were convinced by because it fed into existing bias well, which is exactly the kind of thing we need to expose.<p>We all know for example that FOX News distorts facts, but if you go into a conversation calling them out, you will lose many people who will claim you are biased. By first pointing out specific, provable stories that have been misreported by all media, you can get a person to believe that news is being poorly reported. Then, after you have convinced them of that, and that it is a problem, you can say &quot;hmmm... now I wonder who is most guilty of perpetuating this.&quot; You&#x27;ll find FOX news in there of course, but if you actually look you will find that all corporate-owned media has turned into fact-indifferent &quot;news entertainment&quot;.<p>Also, it isn&#x27;t irony to cover something specific instead of the broader issue.

I suspect pthread primitives are also careful to avoid coordination when none is needed.<p>I don&#x27;t actually see how a task queue would unschedule a consumer for each element if the queue is not empty. What is going to wake up the thread that is blocking on a non-empty queue? I guess I am spoiled by having queues solved well in a standard library.<p>Context switching is also something that comes up a lot as the sort of thing that is expensive. Context switching is only expensive if task size is small relative to the cost of a context switch which isn&#x27;t that large. My experience is that for small non-blocking tasks you can run thread per core to expose the available parallelism and everything else will tolerate context switching.<p>I am also perpetually hearing about the importance of hot caches and not switching threads. Caches are just tracking state for tasks, and unless you have actually done something to create locality between tasks there is nothing to make them stay hotter anyways.<p>If the state the cache is tracking is multiple thread stacks, well... the CPU doesn&#x27;t know the difference between data on a stack and data that it is chasing through some pointer.<p>The real problem is having a task migrate to a different CPU instead of waiting its turn in the right spot and that can be solved other ways.<p>Access pattern matters as well. If you are going to sequentially process buffers then prefetching will work and there is no benefit to a hot cache. That is where the emphasis on zero copy tends to show holes. Think about the difference in speed between RAM and a network or disk interface, and how much processing you are going to do beyond just the copying.<p>My main beef is that pushing this kind of performance thinking without providing measurements that show where it does and doesn&#x27;t matter encourages the kind of premature optimization that isn&#x27;t productive.",1400703976

While breadboards enable the reuse of all components due to the lack of soldering, attaching the wires to the breadboard for a complex circuit is messy and complicated and prone to human error.<p>Integreight has developed a new analog integrated circuit that sits behind the breadboard and can make connections between any two points through software configuration rather than through physical wires. We have also developed a software suite that enables electronic circuit design and optimizes the placement and ‘virtual’ wiring of components on the breadboard<p>Smart Breadboard is a multifunctional hardware kit controlled via computer software. The main concept of Smart Breadboard is to connect between the components of any electronic circuit without the need of using jump wires. As previously mentioned the old methods of wired connections arose the problems of complexity, inefficiency, unreliability, wasting time and effort. We offer a unique methodology of the solution for a real existing problem that is not offered by other solutions available in the market.<p>The breakthrough of Smart breadboard is that it combines between the simplicity and speed of software simulation, and at the same time provides realistic results as it is hardware implementation.<p>The following are results of using Smart Breadboard:\n\uF0B7 cut the time spent cutting, uncovering and placing the wires<p>\uF0B7 reduce the effort exerted<p>\uF0B7 reduce the technical errors<p>\uF0B7 User plugs Smart Breadboard kit into the computer<p>\uF0B7 He then opens computer software that has a schematic view<p>\uF0B7 He chooses the desired electronic components and draw connections between them virtually.<p>\uF0B7 After finishing the circuit design, he goes to the breadboard view, where he places the components on the virtual breadboard<p>\uF0B7 At the same time there are guiding LEDs on the hardware kit that lights the exact location of the selected component on the real breadboard<p>\uF0B7 The user then clicks the upload button to upload the connections on the hardware, and the circuit is completed.",1400703899

Thursday’s New York Times reports, “Federal regulators appear to share one view about so-called net neutrality: It is a good thing.”  While the battle is far from over, for sure, it’s perhaps the first positive sign that there’s hope for startups.<p>Why is net neutrality so important to startups? If CNN and Disney, Netflix and NBC can all pay Comcast and Verizon to “push” their content faster and ahead of companies without zillions, it puts any startup company at a severe, perhaps deadly disadvantage.  It’s classic “big money runs big government,” and as undemocratic as life can get.<p>Roughly 60 days ago, on the World Wide Web’s 25th birthday(March 14 if you missed it) Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of “www,” cried out for “net neutrality,” without the prioritization that a recent Federal court case suggested was totally ok. p>Remember January 2011, when Egypt’s struggling government actually turned off the internet to stifle protests? Or China’s choking internet pipes to stifle free speech?  Yes, founders, this is far more toxic than slowdowns of monthly users or page views!<p>To understand “net neutrality” just type “avc.com” into your browser, where Fred Wilson shows us exactly what happens.<p>We’re clearly not out of the woods yet.  All that actually happened yesterday was the FCC’s agreeing to “open the debate.”  This will bring big gun lobbying pressure that maims startups(not to mention oppressed folks striving to be heard. Their budgets are usually even smaller.)  As the Times says, “before the plan becomes final, though, chairman Tom Wheeler, will need to convince his colleagues and an array of powerful lobbying groups that the plan follows the principle of net neutrality.”<p>\nWrite Hon.

It was a side-node and I see how it could be taken the wrong way.<p>> To explain my side: third-party code tends to be of low quality and interact with other third-party code in interesting ways. When things go wrong, and they always do even with the best programmers and the best code, the more bad third-party code you have, the more you have to dig through to find and fix the fault. This objection largely goes away if you only use dependencies of extremely high quality<p>I already knew what you meant, this is not the first time I have this discussion :) But I should have been more explicit:<p>When we talk about dependencies that were created by a third-party, so _not_ dependencies per se, you are completely right and we are in full agreement. To quote from the blog post:<p><pre><code>    “Minimal dependency is not just about the number of libraries you use,\n    but also about the total amount of code you pull into your project.\n    Less code means less bugs.”\n</code></pre>\n> but to be brutally honest, there aren&#x27;t enough such projects out there to be able to make a mess from them<p>I doubt you checked all of them, but seeing as everyone makes mistakes in their own code, I think it’s fair to assume that there is a lot of code that could be improved.<p>Where we seem to differ, but tell me if I’m wrong, is that you in principle choose to not deal with any of them, probably because it wastes time (?). Whereas I prefer to choose a small one that does (almost) exactly what I need and (almost) is where I want it to be code-wise and then contribute to that project, instead of starting over.<p>To facilitate the mentality that I and many others have, it helps to have a tool and ecosystem that makes libs discoverable and ‘simple’ to build upon/together.",1400703559

7780520,comment,7779300,7779555,5,0,anigbrowl,,,"I don&#x27;t think a global wealth tax is practical, so questions of its desirability are moot. I don&#x27;t think that an endlessly progressive system of taxation is that desirable either, but on the other hand I think your idea of market constraints are also a bit facile. Of course some people misjudge a market and go bust spectacularly, but most people with a lot of wealth tend to accumulate more.<p>ISTM that Piketty is reaching for a global wealth tax because he doesn&#x27;t have anything in his economic modeling toolbox that would do the trick instead, so proposes reducing inequality by fiat. He&#x27;s right about the problem, without having a good solution.<p>the problem is not the existence of inequality <i>per se</i>. I am fine with some inequality and consider it is natural for Pareto distributions to emerge in economics, just as in nature the existence of whales and elephants is not the result of a conspiracy against plankton or ants. Indeed, there are abundant examples of unequal distributions in nature, from the lengths of rivers to numbers themselves, ie Benford&#x27;s law.<p>However, the distribution of capital is <i>not</i> an entirely natural process, and most people who think it is are handwaving simplistic economic models of perfect competition, infinitely substitutable goods, and so on, and forgetting that these perfect models only exist <i>ceteris parabus</i>, ie &#x27;all other things being held equal.&#x27; In reality capital flows through a complex contractual, regulatory, and legislative economic environment that treats different participants differently, interferes with default supply and demand (often for perfectly good reasons), and which in turn can be influenced by the infusion of more capital through political lobbying or plain old corruption. What we often end up with instead of a &#x27;free market&#x27; is a &#x27;superstar economy&#x27; where capital flows increase disproportionately towards people in the top 1%* of the economy, resulting in much <i>greater</i> inequalities than we would expect in a Pareto model.<p>There&#x27;s an excellent book on this trend ion the Entertainment industry called <i>Blockbusters</i>, written by Anita Elberse last year. Here&#x27;s a salient excerpt taken from  <a href=""http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2013/10/16/the-most-important-thing-you-will-read-all-day/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2013/10/16/t...</a> (~1000 wrods, worth your time) with this particular bit pointing out that Chris Anderson&#x27;s &#x27;long tail&#x27; model doesn&#x27;t seem to be panning out as he predicted or as a lot of <i>digerati</i> and creative types (including myself) hoped that it would:<p><i>The same patterns are visible in album sales. …out of a total of 870,000 albums that sold at least one copy in 2011, 13 album titles sold more than a million copies each, together accounting for 19 million copies sold. That’s 0.001 percent of all titles accounting for 7 percent of sales. The top 1,000 albums generated about half of all the sales, and the top 10,000 albums around 80 percent of sales. Deep in the tail, 513,000 titles or nearly 60 percent of the assortment, sold fewer than 10 copies each, together making up half a percent of total sales.</i><p>tl;dr while we expected a power-law distribution in economics because we&#x27;re so used to them from nature, the way our economic system is actually calibrated results in a much more extreme distribution that almost disappears into the axes of the demand graph.<p>Now this sort of thing is a problem for a lot of creative types, because while we can all leverage the incredibly low marginal costs of digital distribution (hooray), there are often significant fixed costs too, and if you can&#x27;t spread those out over a sufficiently large number of copies then You Are Fucked because you won&#x27;t be able to get enough capital to pay those fixed costs.<p>On the positive side, this works out well for writers: writing is of course time-consuming, but since computers are so cheap these days and most people in the developed world have one anyway, the non-labor cost of producing a literary work is very low. So you can have a runaway hit like <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> where the author typed up a bunch of sexual fantasies, released the result as an e-book (which turned out to be a great move because it&#x27;s hard to tell what people are reading on a Kindle, compared to a peperback novel with a lurid cover), and made a fortune. For musicians, it&#x27;s a bit different; some people are blessed with musical talent, others work hard at it as a craft. But then musical performance has to be recorded or brought to the public, and while that&#x27;s far cheaper and easier than it used to be thanks to digital technologies, it&#x27;s not free or super-easy and so you see a lot of people raising money from fans on Kickstarter to record albums or launch a tour (depending on whether the artists are better skilled/equipped to play live or record themselves). These artists need an extra capital infusion because launching a new musical product has some significant fixed costs which are otherwise tough to accumulate from normal operating revenues.<p>Then there&#x27;s movies, the field I work in. This too has been affected by digital technology; in that there&#x27;s no need to shoot on film any more thanks to digital cameras, and you can also do amazing special effects that would either not have been achievable with practical (physical) methods or which would have been prohibitively expensive. Yay digital. However, the cost of film and the inconvenience of film cameras are only a small part of a typical film budget. You still have to pay for things like actors, propers, locations, food, transport and so on, and where effects are concerned people&#x27;s expectations of spectacle increase to match the processing power available, so the public wants ever more elaborate effects and ever-higher production quality (eg color-grading that requires a <i>much</i> greater degree of visual consistency through the whole film than used to be the case a few decades ago). So the cost of manufacturing a film product that meets normal commercial expectation is still in the hundreds of thousands, if you get lucky; if your business strategy is to sell it rather than hope for awards and then sell it, you need to spend at least $1 million, a sum which does not grow on trees.<p>(There are many famous instances of hit films being made on tiny shoestring budgets of only a few thousand $. And occasionally that happens, but: a) they&#x27;re vanishingly rare; b) they usually take many years to produce; c) the actual cost to get into the theater is <i>always</i> far higher - the low number is what the producers had spent before a movie executive wrote a check to pay for commercial-quality post-production; and d) the shoestring film almost always involves a <i>ton</i> of freebies from friends/relatives/industry insiders. The odds of making a hit film for a few thousand are about as good as the odds of you outdoing <i>Flappy Bird</i> this weekend, ie virtually nil.)<p>Now getting back to economics, this is a problem for filmmakers because unless you start out rich or have good social capital, it&#x27;s not that easy to get your hands on $1 million in the first place, and it&#x27;s more difficult to do so when more and more consumer spending on tickets/DVDs/rentals goes towards blockbuster movies, as there are fewer unit sales over which you can average your fixed costs. This is not to suggest that the pie of consumer movie spending is completely fixed such that if someone who watches my film will necessarily skip yours; but the pie isn&#x27;t infinite and (more to the point) the acceleration of revenue concentration around blockbusters is greater than the overall sales growth, so blockbusters get larger and larger shares of a slowly-increasing pie. The overall increase is <i>not</i> sufficient to maintain sales growth or even parity for less popular/populist offerings. B-movie film god Roger Corman summed up the problem succinctly here: <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/09/18/film-school-roger-corman-explains-why-b-movies-vanished-from-theaters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/09/18/film-school-roger-...</a><p>What happens in practice is a race to the bottom; because it&#x27;s increasingly hard to raise funding for a venture of uncertain commercial prospects as the demand tail shrinks and the (externally) <i>perceived</i> costs of production and distribution fall, that exerts downward pressure on wages as a factor of production for films that are not well-budgeted, such that the extremely bimodal distribution of film sales in reflected in wage scales. Rather than resulting in equilibrium (because goods in this market are not easily substitutable), it&#x27;s far more likely that less successful participants will simply exit the market, which further exacerbates and accelerates concentration.",1400703365

7780445,comment,7779231,7779231,4,0,jcrites,,,"> Imagine a world where all system calls are asynchronous, all events and system calls return values are posted onto a message queue and you could drain the message queue with a single interaction with the kernel.<p>Interesting idea. Have existing OSes explored this? What are the major technical challenges and proposed solutions? Questions and ideas:<p>One option is to design every such API so that it can accept a batch of work. An array of structures representing the parameters to individual logical API calls. Invoke a single API call to hand off the array. Perhaps that will provide most of the achievable benefit, since I imagine these performance-intensive applications are bottlenecked on high volumes of calls to small numbers of APIs.<p>It would be a pain to modify every API interface in this fashion, and I imagine it will be difficult to implement those APIs.<p>Could the kernel provide a single batch facility accepting as input an array of structures representing API calls? The goal would be to make it possible to implement those APIs mostly like normal, such that the kernel takes responsibility for fanning out the batch into individual API invocations, in the simplest case by executing them sequentially; though the implementation of the API could also take advantage of batching as well.<p>Success of the calls would need to be determined through an API like select, or alternatively through IO events on the individual file descriptors being worked-on. There will need to be a canonical format for specifying the API to invoke (function pointer?) and its arguments (calling convention). I imagine this could be quite challenging to implement in general; all state will need to be managed explicitly. For example, you could not use a calling convention where the caller is expected to use another API to get details about why the last call failed (like Windows `GetLastError`), since the state will be clobbered by subsequent calls in a batch.<p>In terms of a mechanism, could the OS and applications communicate through concurrent data structures like the disruptor pattern rather than by direct context switching? It seems like this would potentially require passing input/output through main memory (if crossing CPUs). Unsure if this would provide a net benefit.<p>From a naive perspective this all seems feasible, but also sounds like a huge amount of work and the primary benefit would be for the highest of high-performance applications. Though I wonder how much overall performance would improve for typical applications if we can minimize context switching.<p>Potentially relevant: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7679822"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7679822</a> - Linus Torvalds on the high cost of page faults, which are more likely to happen under frequent context switching.",1400702486

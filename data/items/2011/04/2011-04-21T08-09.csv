2469826,comment,2469669,2469776,4,0,robertk,,,"Right. The best thing you can do is say the numbers are an element of the set of tuples {(x, 6-x) : x \in R}. And that's only if you restrict to reals. Consider the fact that the ""average"" of i and 6-i is also 3. In general, you replace R by k, where k is your field (or even any unital ring where 2 = 1+1 is invertible). Thus, in the finite field F_5, the possible numbers are (0,1), (1,0), (2,4), (4,2), (3,3). More cleanly, you can take the k-points on the variety x + y - 6 = 0.",1303375019

Nobody would imagine that owning a single bookcase stocked with books is equivalent to the operation of a brick and mortar bookstore. Yet here we see Friedman making the same error in comparing amazon with a one man operation.<p>In a sense they are comparable, and that's one of the things that makes the web so wonderful, it's possible for very low overhead business to exist on the web, and it's possible for them to look very professional. However, underneath they are as different as a home kitchen and a commercial restaurant line. Just because you can cook doesn't mean you can be a chef or run a restaurant. Just because you can pack, label, and ship boxes doesn't mean you can match the logistical capabilities of a company like Amazon.<p>Certainly many companies tried. Amazon built itself up quite rapidly with a heavy focus on logistics at scale and product fulfillment. A lot of companies mistakenly believed that you can get away with unorganized chaos and just putting together a bunch of guys with a bunch of boxes in a room and you'd get the same results. Those companies were very wrong, many of them have gone out of business.<p>Amazon, even going back to 1999, has several unique qualities which put it ahead of its competition, not least of which have been melding a high-tech web store on one end to an equally high-tech logistics and fulfillment process on the back end.

Friedman offers a lot of goofy predictions, phrasings, and oversimplifications with an easy, unearned confidence.<p>But some of this is the fault of the form: NYT op-ed columnists have to spit out something at least mildly discussion-worthy and topical, fitting neatly into 800 words, with an authoritative tone befitting the Gray Lady, like clockwork multiple times a week. So all the columns can't be gems, or even fully-baked.<p>(We're now spoiled by blogs, which can vary in frequency, length, and tone with the topic matter, and speculate and self-correct via rapid iteration with readers and other correspondents.)<p>To Friedman's credit, he reported Positively-You's failure  despite the boost of NYT coverage  almost exactly a year later:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/03/opinion/foreign-affairs-saga-of-an-online-pioneer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/03/opinion/foreign-affairs-sa...</a><p>Though, the lessons he draws from the failure are a mixed bag, and mostly boil down to: they couldn't afford advertising once their free media wore off.",1303373672

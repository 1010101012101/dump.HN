10562673,comment,10556731,10561959,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"The money that moves from investor to business is given in exchange for an equal amount of ownership in the business.  That does not, in itself, generate any beneficial economic activity.<p>Here is the degenerate case.  Someone creates a corporation.  They take $1000 from their pocket, put it in the corporate strongbox, issue 100 shares at $10 each, value the corporation at $1000, and put the shares and the key to the strongbox back in their own pocket.  There is a lot of movement going on, but nothing has really changed.  The corporation still doesn&#x27;t <i>do</i> anything.<p>Now suppose that another investor joins in.  They add $1000 to the strongbox, and take 100 shares.  The value of the corporation is now $2000.<p>Really pile it on, now.  98 more investors each add $1000 to the strongbox and take 100 shares.  The corporation is now worth a whopping $100k, with ownership split 100 ways.  This is still a null entity to the larger economy.<p>Now let&#x27;s have the corporation buy a moneymaking machine that costs $100k up front, and makes $100k per year.  The investment $100k goes to the manufacturer, who now gets to spend it.  The corporation hires a machine operator at $50k/year and spends $4k/year on insurance.  The employee gets to spend half of what he makes with the machine.  The corporation is now accumulating $46k in profit per year.  The owners are sitting on ass, cashing fat checks, and the employee is dutifully sending out those checks.<p>That&#x27;s fine.  Without their pooled investment, none of them could have purchased the moneymaking machine alone.  But the benefit does not come from the investment.  It comes from spending money and doing actual work.  Without that, you&#x27;re all just building a new box to hold your money.<p>Now here&#x27;s an alternate scenario.  The person who would otherwise be the machine operator employee borrows $100k with 12 $3k quarterly coupons, and principal to be repaid after 3 years.  (That&#x27;s about 10.8% annual interest.)  Each quarter, he makes $25k with the machine, pays a $3k coupon, spends $12k in living expenses, socks away $9k to pay off the principal, and $1k to insure the machine.  After those 3 years, the operator can now spend that extra $12k/q on something other than living expenses.<p>Now we&#x27;ll go one step further, and instead of getting that $100k from borrowing on a bond, the operator rents the machine from the manufacturer for $4k per quarter (insurance included in lease), and buys it outright after 3 years.  Why would the manufacturer even consider that?  Answer: he can&#x27;t build the machines and operate them at the same time.  The machine that builds the moneymaking machines must necessarily make more than $100k worth of machines per year, after all.  If demand keeps up, the lease-to-own option could be bringing in more income than cash-and-carry sales.<p>So what do the investors really add, here, from the perspective of the machine operator and the manufacturer?",1447451887

The Great Depression was followed by WWII, the decline toward the end of the 60s by the hottest period of Vietnam, the dot.com crash by 9/11 and Iraq, and the 2008 crash by the Ukraine crisis and what seems to have been a near miss between the USA, Russia, and possibly other powers. 2008 was also followed fairly shortly by the rise of ISIS and a re-heating of Iraq and its general region.<p>We&#x27;re hearing a lot about an impending emerging market debt crisis, and we know China has gone to &#x27;heroic&#x27; efforts to backstop its stock market and real estate markets against the first stages of what appeared to be an unfolding crash. It&#x27;s entirely possible that another economic crisis is brewing in China and other &#x27;emerging&#x27; markets, and it could be a bad one. If that&#x27;s the case at some point it will exceed the ability of even China&#x27;s autocracy to prevent it with currency and market manipulations.<p>As I led off with above, I doubt that there&#x27;s an overt <i>decision</i> that happens. I doubt anyone says &#x27;well, the economy&#x27;s down so we better have a war!&#x27; Instead I suspect it&#x27;s a bit like tectonic plates. When an economic crash happens it exacerbates stresses that are already present in the system and quite likely pushes some people and/or state actors over the edge. People often behave more desperately and irrationally under economic stress; you can see this in the willingness of former Soviet officials to actually distribute such deadly material during the waning days of the USSR. Not being able to eat is a powerful motivator.<p>Edit: not deleting this, but I hate to have posted it hours before hearing about Paris.",1447451741

The HIPAA security rule is way more vague about actual controls than a rational person would assume; much more than analogous regulations on financial data (e.g. PCI-DSS). The HITECH amendment added a lot of breadth regarding which parties must comply, but did little to proscribe specific controls. Most providers, contractors, etc. use a framework called HITRUST that attempts to identify and map actual security controls to HIPAA, but even that is not super actionable.<p>One of the hardest problems to solve is the immediate criticality of patient data. You absolutely cannot have someone die because a nurse or doctor forgot their password and couldn&#x27;t look up medical history.

In cases where they are practiced and calculated, they actually convert better than slides. I don&#x27;t have any hard numbers on hand to back that up, but I worked as a developer evangelist for SendGrid for a couple years and I&#x27;ve probably spent too much time thinking about and attending Hackathons, so I feel ok speaking from experience. At any given Hackathon getting 10% of teams to use your product or API is impressive. Whenever someone has a polished live code, interactive demo I can assume it&#x27;ll easily hit that mark. Being able to demo you API live in 5 minutes is a pretty strong guarantee that it&#x27;ll be easy enough to implement during the weekend. Plus, developers love to see code and understand how other developers think!<p>I wrote about how to give a great API demo a few years ago.

Since certain aspects of aging\nmay be primary cause of AD, we hypothesized that J147 would be effective against AD‐associated pathology in rapidly\naging SAMP8 mice and could be used to identify some of the molecular contributions of aging to AD. An inclusive and\nintegrative multiomics approach was used to investigate protein and gene expression, metabolite levels, and cognition in\nold and young SAMP8 mice. J147 reduced cognitive deficits in old SAMP8 mice, while restoring multiple molecular markers\nassociated with human AD, vascular pathology, impaired synaptic function, and inflammation to those approaching the\nyoung phenotype. The extensive assays used in this study identified a subset of molecular changes associated with aging\nthat may be necessary for the development of AD.",1447450614

Observe that the factors of 60^2 all have exponents that are greater or equal than those of 18, so we can multiply 18 by the required factors to get (60^2). This way: 60^2 = (2^2 * 3 * 5)^2 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 18 * c = (2^1 * 3^2) * (2^3  * 3^0 * 5^2)= 18<i>200, so we need to multiply by 200 the numerator and denominator of the initial fraction to get a new fraction whose denominator is a power of 60. Now 7/18 = (7 </i> 200)/(18 * 200) = 1400/(60^2) and 1400 = 23 * 60 + 20.<p>Finally 7/18 = 1400/(60^2) = 0.2360 in base 60.<p>We use the notation 00,01,02, ... 59 for the digits of base 60, so 2360 is a two digits number in base 60.<p>The asterisk used for multiplication is not shown in HN, don&#x27;t know why.",1447450464

10562530,comment,10556332,10556332,0,0,jcrites,,,"The Pomodoro Technique, which is mentioned on the page, has been helpful to me when I need to concentrate on solo work privately. I&#x27;d recommend it. It&#x27;s an effective technique, and the only one I&#x27;ve discovered that&#x27;s been significantly helpful.<p>To summarize: When you start on a task, set a timer for 25 minutes. Work exclusively on that task for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break and repeat. That unit is &quot;a pomodoro&quot;. If any interruption occurs during the task, either an internal interruption like you find yourself reading email instead, or an external interruption like someone comes to your office, then you <i>cancel</i> that task and reset the 25 minute timer. Keep a record on paper of each pomodoro completed successfully, and each that&#x27;s interrupted.<p>One of the primary values of the Pomodoro Technique is that it helps you be realistic about how much useful, productive time you can commit towards your tasks. Upon trying the Pomodoro Technique, a number of colleagues and I have discovered that one&#x27;s reserve of fully focused time is typically around 2-4 hours per day when first starting to use it. (The remaining time per productive day is typically lighter work, like communication and coordination, and interruptions of various sorts. It&#x27;s still work, but it&#x27;s not fully focused work applied to the task you&#x27;ve chosen.) Over time you can adjust your schedule and manage your commitments to squeeze out more solo focused time, if that&#x27;s what you desire. Some types of responsibilities naturally involve interruption and are not well-suited to this kind of solo focused work; however, whether that&#x27;s the case or not, Pomodoro can help you be conscious about how much time you actually have available.<p>The Pomodoro Technique does not fight distraction directly. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re supposed to slap yourself when you cancel a pomodoro. Rather, you just keep track of it. This conscious awareness of your productivity engages a new part of the mind that helps rein in the short-term-rewards part. When you waste a day by doing work off and on while mostly procrastinating, it&#x27;s sometimes easy to miss how much productive time you <i>haven&#x27;t</i> spent. When you measure your productive time as &quot;completed pomodoros&quot;, you can be realistic with yourself about your output, and make changes accordingly. It engages something new in your mind and enables metacognition that notices when you get distracted; when you are supposed to be <i>completely</i> focused on your task, and that notification pops up saying you have new messages, this metacognition will help remind you that you need to ignore it and turn it off, or else cancel the pomodoro. The long-term-rewards part of you that&#x27;s powering the metacognition wants to complete the pomodoro. The act of <i>recognizing those distractions</i> will fight them. I suppose you could call it the Copenhagen Theory of Time Management. :-)",1447450306

But in my opinion, an OS has larger responsibilities when it comes to improve inter compatibility, instead of breaking things to have developers who stay loyal and ending up with apple-exclusive software. I really wonder about the value objective C brings, especially since NextStep did not work as a project. You can&#x27;t always put the fault on library devs.<p>What boggles my mind, is that OSX is an unix underneath, so I don&#x27;t understand why it would do anything different and force developers to learn new habits. That&#x27;s not how you attract devs. Apple has made an habit to break backward compatibility, something neither linux nor windows tend to do.<p>I think it&#x27;s not so much to think that OS manufacturers should not to be different than their competition by separating even how their development tools work. The only objective of that is to have developers who stay loyal to apple because they can&#x27;t have their app running on both windows and mac. Not to mention I had to re do everthing at each new XCode version.<p>So in the end, having my project run on both XCode and MSVC, was too much time lost, so I just sold that aging laptop.

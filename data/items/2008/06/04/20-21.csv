Either way, there's plenty to see & do, and really, they're only an hour apart on a boat (it might save you some money though).<p>The west coast stays pretty temperate year-round (even up here in Canada), but heading south is never a bad idea.  You might want to drop some Mexican destinations in there at the end (beaches never hurt)<p>Another idea might be to see if you can lease/borrow/buy an RV.  Sure, the gas issue sucks, but there's a ton of nice camp grounds up and down the coast, and it will help with your budget.<p>If you do make it up north, I'm out in the Southern Gulf Islands (Mayne Island, Google Map it).

Wonderful, link away.<p>You were complaining that ""otherwise useful"" students were doing poorly in school rather than working minimum wages jobs, specifically mopping floors or flipping burgers.  The poster was complaining especially that they were ""wasting your money.""<p><i>At what point is joining the work force 'giving up'?</i>\nYou are “giving up” at the point when you “give up” on doing better than a minimum wage job with no high school degree.  It’s very hard for a person of average or below-average intelligence and ambition to move beyond this—and these average people are the people we have to consider.<p><i>And how recently did this become the case?</i>\nThis is a flippant question, but here’s an answer anyway:  Around 1870 public education became universal.  Prior to that, we weren’t even trying, and hence, could not “give up.”<p><i>Also, do you not think there are any jobs that don't require at least a high school education, or do you think that a high school education is important even if we know in advance that the person who gets it won't be using it?</i><p>There are many jobs that do not require a high school degree.  In fact, there are examples of people without a high school degree doing almost every kind of work there is, and getting paid all sorts of different salaries for it.  But we’re not talking about exceptions here, we’re talking about average people.  And a high school diploma is very valuable for most people. <a href=""http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/site/c.kjJXJ5MPIwE/b.2060901/k.1D47/Value_of_high_school_diploma_underscored_by_international_report.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/site/c.kjJXJ5MPIwE/b...</a><p>I believe that a high school education is valuable in itself, beyond financials.  If we’re going to have a democracy, it would be nice to have voters have some idea of what’s what.  It’s also valuable in parenting.  These concerns, however, are really not necessary to show the value of a high school diploma.",1212611852

209357,comment,208736,208906,0,0,william-newman,,,"I agree that Crichton's analogy to eugenics is really inflammatory and offensive, and even that that's likely part of his reason for choosing it. But in his defense, it might not be the main reason. Consider: How many examples of bogus expert consensus are still remembered today? It seems to me that in order to be remembered, such examples need to be pretty horrific in one way or another. For example, we still remember that doctors bled patients for centuries. If Crichton had tried to draw an analogy between global warming and the long history of bleeding medical patients, wouldn't that've been offensive too?<p>So what about choosing less-well-known examples, then? E.g., in principle he could have talked about the 1960-era political and academic bogus consensus that the long-run Philips curve allowed governments to reduce unemployment in a usefully stable and predictable way by printing more money. (short form of the last chapter of that story: 1970s stagflation) That analogy would probably've been less offensive than eugenics or bleeding, but it also would've required teaching most people the whole story from scratch. That's a pretty high practical price to pay for being able to use a less offensive example. He might increase his audience by not giving his audience the ""he's just being offensive"" excuse to ignore him, certainly. But people who disagree with him are unlikely to want to trust him, which makes it hard to tell the story convincingly. With the eugenics story he can keep appealing to things that people already know independently, and so can convey his points about the story even to people who're looking for excuses to ignore him.",1212611536

It's too bad that the extreme popularity of many PHP4-based apps is what prevented hosts from upgrading, thus giving developers little incentive to upgrade.<p>The good news is that the popularity of Rails and MVC has inspired a broad selection of excellent MVC frameworks for PHP5 (ZendFramework, KohanaPHP) and with PHP6 on the way and new web hosting architectures on the rise, there may very well be a resurgence in PHP.",1212610538

Itinerary should be whatever you want to see.  You'll never have a better time for traveling than now...young, single, plenty of cash.  Just take your time, and travel <i>light</i>.  The increased stress of moving and keeping up with lots of stuff isn't worth the benefits you get from having the lots of stuff.  If after a few days you really wish you'd brought X, you can probably buy X for less than the hassle of having X, Y, and Z ""just in case"" is worth.<p>2. $1200 is low for anywhere in the bay area, not just SF.  Otherwise, I guess it's probably right (though I haven't shopped for housing anywhere outside of the bay area).  Though I have seen a few good short-term deals on Craigslist.  You might try lining something up a week or two in advance of your trip to any of the high demand areas, since finding something on short notice may be hard.<p>4. Safety net:<p>- Health insurance (from a national provider, preferably)<p>- $200-$300 cash tucked someplace safe - if your wallet is lost, you still want to be able to get a hotel room or something for a night or two, and eating is not optional<p>- Bank account that has ATMs and branches across the range of where you're traveling (BoA, WaMu, Wells Fargo, I guess?)<p>- Good credit card for car rentals and airline tickets (because of the extra ""travel protection"" services they provide...it's trivial, but probably worth getting anyway, as even a small reduction of stress when traveling has a very high value)<p>- Emergency contact names and numbers on a card in visible location in your wallet<p>I agree with Einar.  Trade in the pickup for a small hatchback (though, for reliability, I'd recommend a good Japanese car over a VW, even thought my girlfriend has an 07 Rabbit that's tolerable).  It'll give you more freedom of movement when weather is bad, more security for your stuff, and it'll offer a moderately nicer place to sleep than the pickup if you get stuck somewhere overnight.  It'll also get significantly higher mileage per gallon.  The tradeoff is that it won't hold quite as much, but if it won't fit in a hatchback, you're probably taking too much stuff.<p>I suspect you won't have a hard time getting some HN folks together in the Bay Area.

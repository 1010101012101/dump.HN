Pretty much all Schwalbe commuting/city tires have huge bands of retroreflective material around the sidewalls that make your bicycle quite visible to anything beside you with a light.  (They're really good tires, too.)<p>Most bicycle lights also intentionally spit out a little bit of light to the side to also make you more visible.  I'd recommend investing in a good front light and good rear light (with built-in reflector) before bothering with wheel lights.  Wheel lights are cool if you're willing to maintain twice as many lights as you need (batteries, remembering to turn them on, etc.), but I prefer ease of use and so will not be getting these.  (My rear light automatically turns on when there is both darkness and vibration, and it's a reflector, so there are few cases when I ever need to think about it.  I keep my front light with me at all times and just need to press one button to turn it on.  And I carry spare batteries, just in case.)",1350172520

Maybe this article cycles back around to HN every year or two?<p>There <i>are</i> large populations of users who are <i>forced</i> to use IE6.  Still.  In 2012.  They are not allowed to upgrade their work computers <i>even though they may hate IE6 and use a modern browser at home</i>.<p>The reason is usually that their corporation, hospital, organization, agency, etc. paid lots and lots of money many years ago for custom software that cannot run on newer versions of IE, or is not certified to be reliable/secure/accurate/etc. on newer browsers, and so those organizations must either force their users to use IE6, or pay lots and lots of money, <i>again</i>, to replace/re-certify custom software that is <i>still working perfectly well</i>.<p>So the business case for forcing your employees to stick with IE6 is still very rational in some places, even today.<p>If you're developing a new way to tweet facebook likes or something of that ilk, that's just fine; anyone using IE6 in your userbase should be encouraged to stop.<p>But if your users might include any of the sorry souls who are <i>forced</i> to use IE6, at the very least you should be kind when you tell them they aren't going to be able to use your site.",1350172332

4650129,comment,4649966,4649966,5,0,Alex3917,,,"Honestly I'd say at least 95% of gamification companies were seemingly run by con artists to begin with. Extrinsic motivation completely kills intrinsic motivation, a fact that virtually none of the gamification companies take into account in their design even though presumably most of them know about this since it comes up right away in any decent book on the topic. This means that basically none of these companies had a chance in hell of working. Yet there are tons of investors who've probably never taken more than psych 101 who see these companies and throw tons of money at them without any due diligence, because they intuitively seem like great ideas if you don't understand that they're contraindicated by the academic research. So it just encourages more people to come along and do the same thing.<p>Note to investors: find someone who understands psychology and the other social sciences to help with your due diligence. And not just normal psychology, but also specifically Internet psych. (Which is actually a field.) For basically all businesses you should be looking at whether they're consistent or inconsistent with what the social sciences suggest will work, work great, or be completely non-viable.<p>(Also, it should be noted that there are startups that use gamification to good effect, like Squidoo and Ginzametrics, but these are very rare.)",1350172082

Show me the words that implied that in my comment?<p>(Others have of course - I didn't say ""yeah I agree"" either.) I asked you a question and gave you an opportunity to detail ""why your advice is so valuable"" and I gave you my reasons (before asking that) why I was skeptical.<p>""I have a ton of testimonials from people thanking me for helping them raise their rates. If you email me, I'll send them to you.""<p>If you have a <i>ton of testimonials</i> there are certainly ones (a percentage of the ton) that you could get the people who gave you the testimonials to allow you to post publicly, right?  Isn't that basic marketing? (It is.) So why did you not post some? By the way the use of the word ""testimonial"" implies to me more than someone thanking you by email. I can understand why you wouldn't post a snip from an email that someone sent you. But you called them ""testimonials"" not an email thank you. Either way it would seem that if they are happy they would allow you to use the testimonial - even firstname, last initial and type of company (if not full info).<p>Sorry you take offense to the ""BS"". I gave an example of how I BS'd and got somewhere with it. Donald Trump and many successful business leaders have used ""BS"" to get ahead. So have politicians. BSing is not the same as lying. I understand that hackers have some issue with puffery. That is their choice. (By the way I've also observed over the years how lack of ability to BS holds you back in business.)<p>""I'd be getting refund requests."" Why not post the percentage of people who request refund? Is it 2%, 10%, 0%. Seems that would be a good marketing angle if you were able to get up into the 90's, right?<p>""guessing you're older, and there's ageism at play against me""<p>I would do the same thing to someone who was older.<p>""what degrees or credentials""<p>I didn't raise any issue with degrees or credentials at all. If you had a degree from Harvard I wouldn't have accepted that as anything given what you were trying to sell. I merely wanted backup for what you were doing.<p>""as long as I deliver on my promise""<p>If you reread one of my replies to you will see that I said this:<p>""If I challenge you it's for discussion. Also to point out that others might be thinking the things that I think (at least some people) but not raise the issue. And you could loose business from them.""<p>I have learned much about people's reaction to what I say on HN. I am pointing out to you (I think in a relatively nice way) the impression that I had and then asked some questions. You can take that info into consideration when you go and try to sell to the world of ""older people"" -or- people who don't spend time on HN.  Because you will need it. I'm not selling anything to people who read HN so I will speak my mind as to what I think.<p>Here's the thing also to remember. Selling to people, a wide range of people is not the same as ""getting a job"" or ""finding a girl/guy"". You can be ""slightly crazy"" (as I was just called by someone) and still do fine if you only need 1 wife or 1 job. But if you are selling to many people you have to take into account how what you do might alter what they think.",1350171749

Someone, somewhere in the depths of MS clearly believe they understand HTTP better than you do.

4650087,comment,4649494,4649526,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"""devs aren't gonna have to worry about it""<p>Yeah, out of context but I think this is telling. I know a lot of devs who ignore one browser or another or ignore mile or ignore desktop or only do responsive design as opposed to building out a mobile only site and vice versa. In most cases they do some mental gymnastics to convince themselves they don't need to worry about a certain segment of the market. I think is is dangerous in that it can cost you a lot of money. Many times these decisions are made because they don't want to pay for supporting X or don't want to learn how. Then they justify it by saying that market segment X is too small to support. Instead of being based on reality it instead is just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Market segment X doesn't use site Y not because they're so small but simply because X is not supported. Imagine HN launched today. Today is HN's first day and for some reason PG said we won't support IE because HNers are all using ""better"" ""modern"" browsers. Then he checks the logs and sees a very small portion of IE users that steadily shrinks. Is the portion small because Hackers who use IE are few and far between? Maybe. Or maybe it's because people who visited HN on IE couldn't access the site and so they didn't spread word to their friends who may also use IE and of course they never return because the site never worked for them to begin with and so the number of IE users remains small enough to be ignored. But in reality we know that there are definitely enough HN users on IE to justify supporting it. I know because I see my own logs from HN referrals from posts I've made in the past or people reading my profile. The percentage is lower than other browsers but definitely more than a trickle and surely not low enough to justify not supporting IE if I ever had to make that decision.<p>My whole point is that I think it's dangerous to make assumptions about your audience because they often become self-fufilling prophecies. You can't say a certain platform isn't worth supporting until you have data to show it and you can't get that data (at least not accurate data) unless you support the platform in question to begin with.<p>I do agree with you about Windows phone though. At this point, at least in the mobile space, I think companies would be smart to make their mobile browsers compatible with what's out there now rather than releasing a mobile browser and expecting developers to cater to it. I wonder if the iPhone would've taken off like it did had they decided to release a very stripped down version of Safari and expect devs to modify their sites to support it.",1350170870

(And got some level of unintended fame by calling them ""loony"" on my blog, and having that picked up by BGR. I'm surprised Nokia didn't hire me back at that point just so they could fire me again.) While I think MeeGo was fairly unusable at that point, it seemed to me that in 6-8 months with serious work it could have been awesome. And, apparently, in the shipping N9 it was.<p>The specific ""what if"" question I've thought of that parallels yours is whether they could have gotten, say, <i>two</i> MeeGo devices out in 2011, and three more in 2012, which would have put them in roughly the same place they're in with Windows Phone, but with an OS that was entirely theirs and with what might well have been a larger ecosystem.

4650054,comment,4649494,4649494,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I used to rail against IE. I even bought 2 domains that I planned to use as a totally cliche ""IE sucks"" website. In the past six months I've changed my attitude towards IE. It still leaves much to he desired and versions 6 - 8 are still worth complaining about but I must say the IE9 has been a huge improvement to the point where I've stopped my grumbling. The amount of work it takes to get JavaScript and CSS working consistently across browsers is still more with IE9 but the amount of extra effort is so trivial that I think what I perceive to be harder to get to work in IE compared to Gecko and Webkit is actually an illusion based on a bias towards hating/loving to hate Internet Explorer pre-IE9 and that it's actually not all that difficult at all. At this point I think my (and many other) developers' disdain for IE says more about my own skill at the time than it said about Internet Explorer. And even now when I have a troubling time with IE and curse it to hell I think it's only difficult for me because I've invested so much time into learning the quirks of Gecko and Webkit but always ignored/avoided learning about Trident and IE because of my prejudice. Many times I had a case of ""my code is right and this browser is wrong no matter what"".<p>Now I have to say I was wrong about IE. It's not the awful monstrosity of a browser I've learned (or rather been taught as the case many times was) to hate. There's no disputing the fact that Internet Explorer from v6 to v8 got stale, held the web back, and was a pain to work with. The IE team got so used to creating the rules rather than playing by them that they seemed to think their reign would last forever and they seemed to ignore all standards for a time (in the case of the Trident CSS box model I have to admit I think that makes more sense). However this is not then. Today's Internet Explorer has a bigger problem with prejudice and it's reputation than anything technically inferior.<p>There's still a lot left to be desired from IE like a shorter release cycle that adopts new specs and standards like the Webkit and Gecko browsers are doing but despite that there's still not very much you can do in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera that can't be done with roughly equal effort in IE. And with IE10 the gap is closing even more. Sure, Microsoft has made some intentional decisions to support or not support certain features or purposely implement them differently but both Firefox and Chrome make similar decisions and are applauded for them or at least don't get chewed out by the techie crowd for it. I've learned that IE users as a whole are actually a different kind of user altogether with different needs and competency levels than are users of other browsers and I'm talking about those users as a whole, not just the ones working on corporate networks. That considered, I think IE has done a great job of walking the line between keeping up with the pace of the web and serving those users.<p>This is all coming from a reformed IE hater. I learned that in most cases the browser wasn't the problem, it was my laziness or lack of skill that was. That was hard to admit. To all the people thinking of dropping support for IE or hating on it as its so easy and trendy to do, I'd tell you to really give it a shot and learn how to support it. You'll be a better developer for it and you'll find it's not as bad as it was when you swore it off all those years ago.<p>Edit: Spelling and brevity (tried my best to shorten this, sorry)",1350169680

So the price differential doesn't seem that great to go from takeout or eat in to delivery. This is why pizza delivery seems so cheap ($4-5 depending on how you tip).<p>When you're ordering delivery of something that wasn't already priced as on-demand, you're going to find the price dramatically increases and you really don't want to pay 2x the normal price for your toothbrush and 12 pack of soda.<p>There's also the economies of scale that aren't set up yet--those will help somewhat once same day delivery is widespread.",1350169202

You see 'hacking it' would imply just getting it to work, I expected to see something, well hackish, like replace the format specifier with %s and then wrap the number in a function call to something which read an environment variable to figure out how to print the number. <i>That</i> would be a hack, what Greg is doing is <i>engineering</i> a change to ls(1) which allows for  pretty printing the numbers. So to my way of thinking the title is wrong, it sets the expectation of a hack and leads to an engineering exercise.",1350169201

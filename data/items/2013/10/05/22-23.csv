That&#x27;s one of several reasons the siloed equivalents of RSS (Twitter, Facebook, etc) &quot;won&quot;.

6502365,comment,6501726,6502213,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is true, but mobile contracts are much murkier than mortgages, and this is by design of the phone companies.<p>Consider how much different things would be if people had month-to-month service contracts and they financed their phone upgrades separately (though the payments were rolled together). Imagine if people could just pay off their device debt, cancel their contract, and move to a new carrier. Or imagine if people could pay off their device debt in advance to avoid the interest payments. Or imagine if people could roll their old device debt into a new loan for a new device, and then carry that forward. It&#x27;s funny how a phone company will give you $500 in financing for a new phone no problem but they outright refuse to give you $550 or $600.<p>I imagine most consumers would probably prefer a more transparent system like this, but the problem is that then they would see how much they are getting shafted. People are locking themselves in to $2k commitments when in reality they should only be committed to $500. Sure there&#x27;s also service attached but a lot of people don&#x27;t use a lot of cell data or make many phone calls. Most people could probably get buy on the cheapest virgin mobile plan, for example, which is just $35/mo.<p>So let&#x27;s do the math. People who are locked into phone contracts due to their device upgrades are locked into about $1150 of extra payments. That works out to an effective APR right around 99.8%!<p>It&#x27;s no wonder that phone companies like things the way they are, confusing and complicated. It allows them to charge usurious interest rates on device purchases without their customers fully realizing.",1381013215

6502352,comment,6501769,6502093,14,0,tptacek,,,"My first impression of it was that it was like a cross between Java and Python. It is unmistakably similar to Java conceptually and syntactically; they are sibling languages, both designed to streamline, simplify, or modernize C.<p>I&#x27;m a Java-literate C/C++ programmer. I would avoid writing straight Java code at all costs; I find it immiserating. Here are some reasons off the top of my head that Golang is more pleasant to work in:<p>* The syntax is deliberately streamlined, including implicit declarations, semicolon insertion, lightweight expression syntax, the capital-letter-exports-a-symbol thing<p>* It has fully functional idiomatic closures<p>* Interfaces get rid of adapter class BS<p>* The table type (maps, in Golang) is baked into the language, like Python, not a library, like C++ and Java<p>* Clearer, more direct control over memory layout; data structures in Golang feel like C<p>I don&#x27;t know if Golang&#x27;s standard library is that much better than Java&#x27;s, but it was obviously designed carefully by and for systems programmers, so I find it remarkably easy to work with.<p>It also feels like a much smaller system than Java. Almost every time I write a significant amount of Golang code, I find myself answering questions by just reading the standard library source code. It&#x27;s easy to get your head around.

Even if I&#x27;m pessimistic about a successful vote.<p>I want to mention a side-point which I haven&#x27;t encountered so far:\nIn the &#x27;problem of lazyness&#x27; (i.e. &quot;who will do the boring work if you are paid anyway?&quot;) one answer that often comes up is automation. Menial/low-skill jobs will be done by robots.<p>It&#x27;s a common image that in the future robots will clean our toilets and grill our burgers while the humans have ample time to enjoy life, build rockets and do fulfilling work.[1] However, if AI research has told us one thing it&#x27;s that this view is quite wrong - the opposite is true. Things humans think of as &#x27;easy&#x27; like walking around or doing laundry are actually very difficult engineering problems and &#x27;hard&#x27; stuff like playing chess or doing rocket science are easier in an absolut sense.<p>The reason behind is simple: Evolution had millions of years to perfect walking on legs and interacting with the environment. Our bodies almost literally have an walkTo(Place) API, so the only thing &#x27;we&#x27; (our conscious self) have to do is to call it. Abstract thinking is something new and our brains have to do it manually. It takes you less time to run over debris than to multiply large numbers and so we have a distorted picture of what is hard in an absolute sense.<p>The picture is true for humans but it falls apart when we want to automate it. We are still decades away of beating humans in soccer but Jeopardy is a solved problem.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that &#x27;low&#x27;-skill jobs are the first to fall into the hands of machines. [2]<p>---<p>[1] Ignore for the moment the fact that unclogging toilets can also be fulfilling.<p>[2] This is of course a broad argument. We still have no clue what Intelligence or Creativity actually <i>is</i> - It may still turn out to be very complicated.

I assumed that this meant that Netflix subscribers would be able to legally and conveniently download as many movies as they like during the period of their subscription.

Netflix certainly think that such a model wouldn&#x27;t work for them, and I&#x27;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

It is impossible to write high-level code without dealing with (and often getting bogged-down by) low-level issues in C++.  Why should I be <i>forced</i> to choose between different &quot;smart&quot; pointer types?  Why should I be <i>forced</i> to decide how variables should be captured by a lexical closure?  Sure, such decisions might make sense when you want to squeeze out a constant-factor improvement in performance, but they do nothing to help you <i>get things done in the first place</i>.<p>2. Error handling and recovery is needlessly and pointlessly complicated.  You can throw exceptions, except for the places where you cannot, and once caught you there is not much you can do to fix the problem.  It is so bad that the C++ standard library actually requires certain errors to not be reported at all.<p>3. Extending the language is impractical.  Look at what it took just to add a simple feature, lexical closures, to the language:  modifications to the compiler.  At best C++ gives you operator overloading, but you do not even have the ability to define new operators.  Lisp, Scala, and numerous other high-level languages give programmers the ability to add new syntax and new features to the language without having to rewrite the compiler.<p>I am not familiar enough with Go to say that it addresses any of this, but I know why I stopped using C++ and why I have not regretted that decision.  All the above make writing reliable code difficult.  I actually switched away from C++ when I needed my code to scale <i>better</i>, because improving the scalability required a high-level approach and I did not have time to debug low-level problems.  Even C++ gurus wind up having to deal with dangling pointers, buffer overflows, and other needless problems with their code -- that takes time and mental effort away from important things in most cases.<p>&quot;When I think about C++ I know that a code written in C++ will take me 100% of the way - even if it takes longer to write.&quot;<p>The same is true of any programming language if the amount of time spent on the program is irrelevant.  I am not sure what sort of work you do, but for what I have been working on, getting things done is considered higher-priority than squeezing out a constant factor improvement.

Besides, things like what you suggest, even if helpful, they complicate the government even more, with more laws, more incentives (which I think distort the reality, sometimes causing more problems than solving them), and another aspect that I like of Georgism is that it simplifies things a lot (there would be only a single tax).",1381011226

Over the years I&#x27;ve grumbled and complained about various cell phone companies policies, dealt with contract obligations, bad service, horrible experiences with switching plans, etc., etc.  The worst of the worst was moving to the bay in late 2007 and having to use AT&T on an iPhone.<p>Last year I bought a Nexus 4 from Google and signed up for a prepaid T-Mobile plan.  A few months later they switched over to offering no-contract plans and I followed suit by putting both my kids and myself on a single plan.  My entire experience with the company since signing up has been nothing short of stellar.  Great customer service, low wait times while calling in, friendly faces in the stores, and always a willingness to do whatever it took to make me happy with my service.<p>My contract, with my two kids tacked on, is about what I paid Verizon a month for an iPhone.  About the only complaint I have with T-Mobile is that I can&#x27;t really surf the net while I&#x27;m in the BART tube under the Bay on the way into the city.  Other than that, it&#x27;s been a great experience!<p>It just goes to show that one person at a company, with the power to make real changes, is what it takes to change an entire industry.

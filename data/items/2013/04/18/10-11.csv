I allege the whole thing is a philosophical artifact created by the idea that unregulated free markets can solve every problem: ""just let the workers fight over it, the best will get the most!""<p>Interestingly, a wide variation is skill is <i>not</i> something that is addressed at all by this don't-ask-don't-tell lottery scheme. If anything, it is <i>based</i> on the idea that two given people with the same skill set end up getting disparately compensated. In what world can that look right to anyone? People wonder why women and minorities get paid less than white males: that is the reason why right there.<p>The truth is, I'd rather rest well <i>knowing</i> I get the same compensation as a coworker than spending energy wondering whether I'm getting ripped off or not. And here's the shocker: I don't want my coworker to get ripped off either! Now if a team member happens to be awful, and he keeps on failing upwards through the ranks of the company, I prefer to have some visible indicators for that as well. You say you prefer to make twice the salary as that guy, but under the system you're advocating you couldn't even <i>know</i> whether that is indeed the case.<p><i>> I (and likely you) don't want to be lumped in with whatever the ""average"" worker of my years experience and skillset is making. </i><p>That really depends on the company and the kind of colleagues you are dealing with. I'd prefer to work in a team where I'm not above everyone else. I like being surrounded by people who inspire me and whom I can maybe inspire in turn. Being lumped together with comparatively untalented coworkers is not just a compensation issue, it also creates an environment where one part of the team has to constantly shoulder additional workload and carry the underperformers (who by the way are almost always better at politics).<p>Getting back to my levels proposal: it already works elsewhere, it's just not used that much in our industry for cultural (and probably philosophical) reasons. Yes, skills vary, but the negotiation-based system addresses this in an even worse way than compensation levels do. My experience with running a level-based system has been overwhelmingly positive. It was pleasant from an administrative point of view, and it created zero contention among employees.",1366281553

That isn't a laughable consideration: ""A security problem in customer's code?  Fire them as a customer!"" Would indeed be effective at reducing their exposure but is not in their interests and has certain drawbacks with regards to one's odds of remaining employed as a security professional.  Many apps - probably most apps - are not under active development, because the customer believes them to work.  Sudden breaking API changes are bad news for them, possibly irreversibly bad news if e.g. the original developer can't be located to fix the problem.<p>A more sensible resolution to this issue, as a hypotherical security professional at an API company, would be moving more of the burden for security onto the company rather than the API consumer, by e.g. limiting the downside risk of a credentials compromise.  (Similar to how banks don't say ""The bad guys got your password?  Sucks to be you, your balance is now $0"", one would be well-advised to eventually have something on the roadmap to e.g. disallow unauthorized or poorly considered code from causing business catastrophe prior to getting a human in the loop.). You'd also want to e.g. make sure your sample code is secure of of the box, and write your first-party libraries to ""just work"" to the maximum extent possible, such that greenfield development would tend to be secured by default.<p>That's being pretty generic, but it's my understanding that many API companies actually do put quite of bit of work into internal anti-abuse tooling, for this and related reasons.",1366280986

In either case, the client's not following the spec. So which way to look at it is correct?<p>My view is that cURL not a client. It's a lowish-level library and command line tool that can turn input into a format that an HTTP server can understand. Of course what puts a kink in this view is that it does things like follow redirects. A convenience for the user if anything. But in the end, you use cURL to build HTTP clients. It's not a client itself.<p>Regardless, you're right. It's a problem with the client not following the HTTP spec. However, I don't think many developers really follow the HTTP spec to begin with. For most, HTTP is URLS, headers, and a limited number of methods. I've certainly been guilty of viewing it as such in the past.<p>So in Platonic heaven, it's the client's fault and by extension the developer's fault.

This is not because mainstream economics is intellectually bankrupt or anything, but it's because economics is <i>extraordinarily complex</i>. A million variables affect the economy of any nation. Similarly, inflation and deflation do not exist in a vacuum; the currency is not the only variable influencing inflation; thousands of other variables can affect inflation; ditto for GDP.<p><i>Inflation does not directly lead to or cause higher GDP, unlike what you seem to imply.</i> But it's generally agreed that moderate inflation is necessary and unavoidable for growth, and is preferable to the consequence of tightening monetary policy, which is lower GDP growth.<p>The textbook example for one (out of hundreds) of the possible reasons for stagflation is a rise in commodity prices. For example, the US experienced a long period of stagflation in the 1970s because oil prices skyrocketed - not because of inflation, but because several Middle Eastern nations stopped/curtailed oil shipments. This is called a ""supply shock"" in economics, and it causes inflation by increasing prices, while decreasing GDP by making it more expensive to buy the resources (e.g. oil) necessary for production. Another ""textbook"" reason (again, I have no idea whether these actually apply to Brazil) would be a loose monetary policy (high inflation), coupled by heavy government regulation (low GDP).",1366280760

Shortly afterwards the team dissolved, they gave back back most of the funding because they agreed with the investors that it was never going to be big and the shoestring team that remained reinvented the site as (as far as I can see) a niche, subscription site.<p>I also think there are some warning bells in the Techcrunch article:<p>>""Internet porn sites are still shameful artifacts of a decade past  from when the Internet was a collection of websites featuring low-resolution images and oversized banner ads""<p>You should always be very careful when labelling a sophisticated and fast-moving industry as out-dated as the accusation can come straight back at you. The current sites could be better designed but frankly they are not bad and represent huge technical feats, streaming massive amounts of video to huge numbers of people. Since what they give out is free and they've been going for as long as YouTube I think it's fair to conclude that they're  monetising that content effectively via advertising.<p>I'd be very surprised if this is an industry which can be won by design improvements. I think there are largely two types of company 1) the free sites who generate most of their cash from lead gen and advertising 2) the subscription sites who create content that's sufficiently high quality or niche that people will pay for it. The latter sites are the revenue stream for the former.<p>Paintbottle looks to me like it's going to catch itself in between these two models. I would guess it's going to struggle as a free site (since it doesn't have any ads) and will also struggle as a paid site because it's not sufficiently niche and its funding expectations may preclude the types of revenues it could viably make.

According to the spec:<p>> HTTP provides a simple challenge-response authentication mechanism which may be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information.<p>The client should make two requests. The first with no credentials to see if the resource is protected (the challenge part). The server will then respond with a 401 Unauthorised status and a WWW-Authenticate header indicating what authentication to use. The client will then make another request with the given authentication.<p>The insecurity is caused by curl not doing this challenge response, it is just sending the credentials straight away.",1366279804

5569701,comment,5557985,5568186,2,0,1amzave,,,"OK, bear with me as we get slightly contrived here...(and deviate a little from my earlier, somewhat less thought out example).<p>Say your workload has some inherent requirement for random (throughout its entire execution) access to a dataset of size N.  If you run it on a single processor with a cache of size N/2, you'll see a lot of cache misses that end up getting serviced from the next level in the storage hierarchy, slowing down execution a lot.  If you add another processor with another N/2 units of cache, they'll both still see about the same cache miss rate, but cache misses then don't necessarily have to be satisfied from the next level down -- they can instead (at least some of the time) be serviced from the other processor's cache, which is likely to be significantly faster (whether you're talking about CPU caches relative to DRAM in an SMP system or memory relative to disk between two separate compute nodes over a network link).<p>For a more concrete example somewhat related (though not entirely congruent) to the above scenario, see <a href=""http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece845/docs/lardpaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece845/docs/lardpaper.pdf</a> (page 211).",1366279718

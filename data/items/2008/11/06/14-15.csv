His predecessor who decided that Yahoo should be a media company (ala AOL) rather than a tech company (ala Google) screwed it up.  So, the technology languished as they tried to throw poorly construed media at people.  Only problem is that isn't profitable.  Tech is.<p>So, now Yahoo either has to spend a ton to catch up with a company (Google) that shows no signs of slowing down or combine forces with another tech firm (Microsoft) who might be able to eek out something.

Don't think of this as the ""wussy"" path: as repeated in the article, learning how to make even the simplest games on your own is a humongous time investment.

355711,comment,355627,355627,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, there are a few things to consider.<p>First, how much work will the new owner need to put into it?  $15,000 worth of work per year?  Remember $10k only pays for about 5-6 hours of work per week.<p>Second, how likely is it that someone can de-seat your site?  That makes it much less likely that the site is worth so much.<p>Third, would a competitor, given a decade, be able to build what you have built with relative ease?  This is key to how long you would run a regression.<p>So, if you assume that the site is good for 12 years, a simple regression would give you about $200k as a valuation.  BUT, that assumes they won't need more than 5 or 6 hours a week of work on the site.  AND it assumes that it can't be easily built by a competitor.  AND it assumes your site will stay that profitable (which is usually true in something like real estate, but not in technology which is constantly changing).<p>Even if you think the site will stay relative for the next 25 years, it's value wouldn't top $300k simply because future dollars aren't worth as much as present dollars in a net present value calculation since there is an opportunity cost to tieing up your money.<p>However, your site may be growing.  In that case, it might be worth more.<p>So, if your site needs a full-time programmer, it's worthless.  I mean, it's worth something to you because it can be your income.  However, it's not worth anything to an owner since they'd be paying all of the income to a programmer (yes, even if that's themselves since they aren't getting the site for free).<p>So, it's really dependent on how much work goes into keeping it alive/competitive.  This might be your job/income.  That's good for you, but worthless to an owner purchasing it.  If it requires about an hour of work a week to keep it competitive and it will be that way for a decade, it's probably worth north of $200k.",1225982784

355688,comment,354802,355663,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I don't think it's true that the predictive accuracy of a model is always as accurate in one parameter as it is in another. I think that only holds if the model is believed almost for certain. In reality you have a distribution of models that you might believe. Suppose you impose some smoothness assumptions on the system: that the response isn't too wild anywhere that you're looking. Then you can make the successive approximations: first you assume that, in this domain, asymptotically, these are linear, separable PDE's. Then if you spend all your time jiggling one parameter, it gives you a bunch of information and constraints on the response for the one parameter. If you jiggle it still further, you might be able to ascertain some glimpse of the nonlinearity, and nonseparability of the system. So for example you might know a fair amount, might have constrained the space of possible models for CO2 - NO2 coupling, or CO2 - water vapor coupling, or CO2 - SO2 coupling. You might see some of the homogeneous CO2 nonlinearities. But you'll know way less about SO2 - acid rain coupling. That's much higher order.<p>Regardless, my point is that if we stay within the phase space that we know, it's a lot safer.<p>You need different levels of confidence depending on the choice you're considering. If the prediction is ecological disaster, 90% confidence is good enough to convince me not to try it. If the prediction is a 90% chance of it being okay, that has to be weighed against the much more confident prediction we have that if we gradually turn down the manmade forcing on the environment, things will stay pretty close to alright.<p>So it's less like your glider example than the reverse. Someone shows you a videotape of a large body, of mostly known shape, traveling through a fluid of unknown density and viscosity. We know that most things fall. We know that most gliders are unstable. Yet we are climbing this mountain and approaching this cliff ledge. And I think it's prudent to say, look. Ground is good. We had better be a lot more sure than this if we want to fly this thing. We shouldn't fly the climate recklessly.<p>[ps, I am going to sleep now.]",1225981301
355687,comment,355576,355576,0,0,kxt,,,"Seeing benchmarks conducted by Phoronix always fills me with emptiness on the inside. While I really welcome the idea of benchmarking Linux, their methodology always seem lacking for me.<p>All we get are a bunch of numbers, without any actual investigation of what those numbers should represent, what can be the reason of the outcome, and sometimes the measurements make simply no sense.<p>For example, according to these benchmarks, Ubuntu 7.04 reads memory twice as fast as newer versions. There is no possible way it can be a valid result. At least assuming that the exact same compiled code was used on every installation. Which brings us to another problem: no information on the tests. All we get is a software name, a version number and the result numbers. Which would be almost fine if they were prepackaged binaries, but with FOSS different compile time options and compiler flags can make quite a difference in the results too.<p>About the nonsensical tests: RAM speed should be the same regardless of the OS. So dedicating a full page to RAM speed tests should be senseless. No. It's actually a nice control to the tests, and the numbers show that there's a problem somewhere. Either the tests, the measurements are off significantly, or there is something flawed in either the 7.04 configuration or the others that cause almost 50% difference in such test.<p>Also, measuring compile times. They managed to measure the time it takes to compile 3 software written in C using an unspecified compiler with unspecified options.<p>At the end, no conclusion were drawn, just the results summaried in English instead of plain numbers.

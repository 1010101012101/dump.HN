If you get a response, then you can ask further questions and provide help.  If you get no response, your next move is to use first aid skills and call emergency services.  If you are trained in CPR, proceed.  Your loud voice might also catch the attention of someone with the appropriate training, or someone who can call emergency services while you administer CPR.<p>... But this wasn't someone collapsing at a mall, on the street or somewhere else where they might not be noticed.  This was someone collapsing on stage.  Standing up, rushing the stage and attempting to help could just as easily have caused a riot of well meaning folks and could have gotten in the way of staff who should be trained to deal with this sort of circumstance.  I'm not accosting staff for not being prepared, I'm just defending those in the audience who didn't rush to help.  As a child, I did a lot of community theater (the sort where you pay $5 to participate and your mother may need to sew your costume), and there was always someone with the appropriate training to handle a circumstance like this (usually our lone director, or a member of tech).  Thankfully, we never had an incident, but this makes me wonder ... would they have responded within 15 seconds or waited to see if I tripped and could ad-lib my way back into character?

But spending time with strangers and just asking things like how do they view things and do they do can lead to many opportunities and improvements in your ideas.<p>Additionally randomly hanging out with people is sort of like Social Bread-first search versus Depth-first search. If you think about it it actually increases the opportunities you have by knowing by definition a larger 'breadth' of people.<p>Good luck guys.",1290038464

You can have co-workers who you enjoy working with, respect, like, but they still might not really be your friends.<p>But I think LinkedIn's success is partly because Facebook hasn't solved the social context issue.  Work vs. friends is very important, but there are also differences in how we act with close friends vs acquaintances, friends vs. family, or even close friends that we met at different points in our lives.  That would be a very difficult problem to solve cleanly, are there any social networks that are trying?",1290038451

They are about as far from being a hoarding patent troll as one could imagine yet that is how they seem to be portrayed in some parts of social media.<p>Even if you strongly disagree with their approach to suing competitors, I would have thought the real innovation and change Apple has brought to the scene would count for something and result in some more balanced coverage.<p>I think some of the specific patent cases Apple is pursuing against Samsung are a bit ridiculous (rounded corners), but I also think when you look at what Samsung has done <i>as a whole</i>, it is pretty clear they were ripping off Apple designs for a while (try and play spot the difference between a Apple 3GS and a Galaxy S1). Maybe Apple had to pursue the more silly specific patent cases because there was no way to patent the overall look-and-feel of a device (no lawyer here).<p>Anyway just my 2c",1351241906

If you use markdown, and wish to propose a better markdown than markdown, go for it, I'm sure lots of people will be pleased, but bear in mind that lots of people will whine about any bugs as well, and expect you to work for them for free and spend significant resources and time fixing edge cases which don't matter to you personally, just because you released the source.<p>If you're ready for that though, of course go ahead and create a better markdown, or help with this proposed spec, Gruber certainly can't stop you. It doesn't really matter what Gruber says, what trolls on a mailing list say, or what you say on this forum about his responsibilities, whether he is self-appointed dictator for life etc (though I'd dispute that), what counts is putting the work in, which is often surprisingly  difficult - far more difficult than criticism.",1351240461

Why should I need to figure out how to use a chisel? What if the gnome is very fragile so I can't do it without breaking it?<p>Just as carving a garden-gnome is not intended, manufactured, or expected behavior, there's absolutely NO reason for a phone manufacturer to go out of their way to offer jailbreaking tools. Your statement is completely illogical. Just because it is legal for a user to do something does not mean a company should have to do it. Even if it is legal for a user to do something doesn't mean that they must be able to reasonably do it, it just means if they do there won't be legal ramifications. Your post reeks of self-entitlement and a deep misunderstanding of the actual issue in question.<p>Another ridiculous example to round it out: Since it is legal for me, as a user, to attempt to install visopsys (an operating system made by one man which is obviously incompatible with everything)  on my macbook apple provide drivers and support for installing this OS even though supporting it would likely take thousands of developer hours and gain Apple nothing. Users likely won't be able to install it on their own and developing drivers for it is probably near impossible.<p>See how your argument is exactly the same as the above? Jailbreaking, just like that OS, is the product of users and as such need only be supported by users. If a company wants to support jailbreaking, such as google allowing chromebook unlocking, that's their prerogative, but there is NO reason to expect or insinuate that a company should actually provide support for some random operation a user has come up with that in fact is to the company's detriment.<p>Honestly, considering the quality of your argument, I question your ability to function in society.

Each download would cost them about $4000 in bandwidth fees.<p>They already know how to store massive amounts of data, and how to send it over the network. Assuming $100/TB for their own media means it would only cost them about $4000 to store it themselves.<p>Assuming you have 1Gb/s connection rate, that would take you over 7 days to download. It's probably both cheaper and faster to write the data to disk and ship the disk then to an S3 download.<p>It reads more like they don't know if or how people want to use this.

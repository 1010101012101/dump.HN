There's no technical fix, there's a mentality fix. The act is as old as the hills, and they provide balance to the debate. Trolls are a form of court jester.<p>I am therefore pro-troll and anti troll-victim.",1218527176

273798,comment,273240,273240,0,0,sharjeel,,,"Also, if your scripts have any dev mode features for testing (such as cleaning up some database values and regenerating, removing some files etc), make sure that you are unable to execute them on production or some sort of confirmation is required.<p>I had a script on my server that did clustering of stories from different news sources. The script also had some test methods which deleted all the clustered data and rebuilt it. I once accidentally ran the ""cleanup method"" on prod server and that created disaster because somehow cascaded deletion took place. I had to refer to replay log to get everything back and took hours of efforts plus a lot of pressure. From then onwards I placed a check on each of my script to get a confirmation twice before executing any such test method on prod server.",1218525306

It seems to have all the features I want, and the processor looks <i>beastly</i>.

I like OS X, but the lag kills me compared to my primary server/desktop machine with quad xeons and 4 gb of ram :\<p>Sigh. I'm not paying what apple or second-hand sellers want for a mac. Period.

273794,comment,273034,273250,0,0,wensing,,,"It's not only because it's different than Google, it's because it's not explained, i.e. they make a poor assumption: namely, that the interface they're presenting contains enough information for me to make a good decision.  I don't find that's the case.  I find it hard to choose between ""Web Screenshot View (Searches Yahoo)"" or ""4 Sources View (Searches Ask, Google, MSN, Yahoo)"".  I really have never thought about it.  Just give me the results in your best guess format, and I'll take it from there if I'm unsatisfied.<p>Also, the need to move really far through horizontal space to explore all the different views is ungood.  Small multiples, if you want to call these that, should be placed in a grid, not a long single-file line.",1218525021

273792,comment,273529,273529,0,0,rcoder,,,"I have a BlackBerry Curve on T-Mobile, and generally think it's the best mobile email client I've ever used. There are a decent number of downloadable apps, and OTA J2ME provisioning is actually pretty awesome. In terms of ""hackability"", it's tough to find anything better than a full-featured, reasonably-fast Java stack, since you can do development and deployment from your choice of platforms and hosting providers.<p>However, the Curve firmware (at least at OS version 4.3) has two major flaws. First, it's intermittently crash-prone and slow when using 3rd-party applications. Second, it locks up after a few minutes and has to be hard-rebooted when I try to use it as a Bluetooth modem for my Mac, which is especially annoying since a full restart takes more than five minutes.<p>Regardless, I still think I made the right choice in selecting the Curve over an iPhone, for one simple reason: UMA. Being able to pay $20/mo. for unlimited calling over any WiFi network has already paid for itself many times over when I've been outside the US (or even in rural parts of the US) and avoided having to pay roaming fees.",1218524861

273788,comment,273625,273625,0,0,pierrefar,,,"I think there are two questions here we need tease out:<p>1. Are enough science stories being submitted? If not, why not?<p>2. What happens to the science stories when they are submitted?<p>I can't answer the first question (anyone got data?) but from experience submitting a few science stories is that they get a couple of votes and die. This, I think, is an interesting observation.<p>The hint of an answer also comes from my experience: I get my science news fix elswhere. HN, to me, is about things that make me think harder/better or see the world in a new way. Granted that's not always the case, but the gems here outclass any gem elsewhere I've seen.<p>So what think is happening is that we don't care for mainstream science news. I think for a science story to survive here, it needs to be a slightly off the beaten path subject with a very clever title - hackers are humans after all and headlines can affect them emotionally to get them to up vote.",1218524483

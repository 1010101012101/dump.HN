And that the review started, by a big-name journal, in Dec. 2014 - over 9 months ago. While the newer paper was reviewed and published, by a no-name journal, in under a week.  The discrepancy is huge - professionally, and scientifically. There is no reason a discovery needs a year in review - that is simply laziness on the part of the big prestigious journal. And that they&#x27;re now being scooped by a competitor puts them in a poor light. This seems as much about the various journals as it is about the authors, and the universities.<p>The new journal eLife is a wonderful happy medium - month-long high-quality reviews for a high-quality paper.",1442937537

In various low-volume industrial stuff there are heaps of Atmel made &#x27;51s, but only reason for that is familiarity (and to lesser extent AVR-compatible ISP).<p>Another thing is that Atmel is prone to supply chain problems.

You wouldn&#x27;t think this a big annoyance, but it gets annoying after several hours.<p>- Amtrak cars can have issues - I spent 12 hours in one with a door that kept opening and closing making a huge &#x27;clunk&#x27; noise every 30 seconds. A passenger finally figured out a way to make it stuck open.<p>- Watch your stuff, Things can and will get stolen - particularly in areas where there&#x27;s multiple close stops (e.g. the stops near seattle) - last time the person in the seat in front had their smartphone stolen while they took a brief break in the snack car.<p>- The co2 savings compared to flying depends on the actual route and timing - I have to point this out because amtrak does market themselves a bit on co2 savings - I calculated this once between flying and taking the train from seattle to spokane, and after factoring in the need to stay at a hotel an extra night for the train along with it&#x27;s non-direct route, the co2 difference was negligible. Here&#x27;s my math for those curious: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/zTHfSB8.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/zTHfSB8.png</a><p>- Certain trains are historically, tragically slow - 
amtrak has a website logging the timeliness of trains, typically 70% on time for a long train is on the good side.<p>This said, I do want trains to be more of a thing here - I&#x27;ve had great experiences with the ones in europe, wish the pioneer train ( <a href=""http://pioneertrain.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pioneertrain.org</a> ) and ski train ( <a href=""http://www.skitrain.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skitrain.com/</a> ) make a comeback, and prefer taking the business class amtrak trains for shorter trips over flying or driving.

Something is more efficient if you are able to do more of a desired activity at the cost of fewer resources. The resource in question varies.<p>Yes, one often in computer science focuses on algorithmic complexity as the resource to be economized on. But time and power are also perfectly reasonable resources to have in mind. In fact, they are the resource that most audiences will naturally assume when they see the word &quot;efficient&quot; standing along, without further explanation.<p>I think GP is probably wrong to criticize as well -- making code more efficient [or, if you insist, fast] makes it easier to support more users that it could support otherwise. Is the ease with which a system can support an additional user not the very definition of the word &quot;scalability&quot;?<p>Of course, there are more powerful, and more specialized techniques for improving scalability, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the author is wrong to suggest that speed improves scalability.",1442935420

For my first 2 years out of college I worked on an Android app at a Big Company that you are probably familiar with. During that time I made a lot of big features and got to work on support related infrastructure like automated testing. We also had a lot of people using our app which was a great feeling. I learned a lot about app development and really enjoyed it.<p>About a year ago I started getting bored at my job and quit to pursue freelance app development. Since then I have worked on 3 pretty big apps. It has been fun but I discovered something disturbing. For each app I work on I find about 50% of my time spent developing is interesting and creative. The other 50% is well... I feel like I am constantly reinventing the wheel. Once again I am getting pretty bored.<p>I considered switching from Android dev to something else like web development or maybe even iOS. But I have a strong suspicion that I would experience the same issue. I have a feeling that I am just not that into developing consumer facing apps.<p>Given my position as a freelancer I am able to spend a good amount of time on self education while still being able to maintain my relatively inexpensive lifestyle. I find computer security and AI to be incredibly interesting but I have no relevant experience in either of those things. Even if I read a bunch of books on it, how would I get hired?<p>I guess what I am asking is, has anyone here jumped from one genre of programming to a completely different one? What was your experience like? How did you get paid once you made that switch? Were you able to maintain your current level of income or did you need to take a pay hit? I really can&#x27;t go back to school so I would like to hear about the DIY approach to doing this specifically.<p>Would appreciate any stories etc.<p>Thanks!",1442935292

For example, I just used a Groupon for a local new Mexican place in my area. Turns out the reason their gorgeous restaurant is mostly empty is because the food sucks. There&#x27;s a Mexican place down the road from them with low budget hand-made booths that&#x27;s exploding with customers, the difference is that their food is good.<p>I&#x27;d say I probably stick with less than 10% of the new places I find through Groupon. I&#x27;d probably be willing to pay more to try new things...but not a whole lot more. As a consumer I have to change my basic behavior patterns and maybe travel out of my way to try something new, I feel like I&#x27;m meeting the place halfway. Sometimes I have to travel someplace I&#x27;ve never been before, and after getting there I&#x27;ll know if it&#x27;s reasonable to continue coming out there. The horse lesson I took I enjoyed, but it&#x27;s also an hour of hard driving to get there, while I live right on the edge of plentiful horse country. Now I know I had fun taking a lesson, I might give a go at one of the local places, but I&#x27;ll probably not return to the place I used the Groupon with.<p>There&#x27;s also places, like a zipline center I Grouponed at. It was cool, I&#x27;ll return. But it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s an every week kind of place. So I think businesses also have to consider their model. I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it without the Groupon, but it acted more like an advertisement would.<p>I also went to a high-speed gokart center on a Groupon. Turns out they already have lots of business, but it&#x27;s all dedicated racers who knew what they were doing. When I went there I had to sit through a half hour of safety training videos, and when I got on the track it was terrifying because everybody else was hardcore and very aggressive. It could have been fun if everybody wasn&#x27;t taking it so seriously, or they bundled all the Grouponers into a beginner league or something. So I don&#x27;t think it worked as an expansion of their basic business.<p>I think business issues with Groupon are more complicated than people give credit for.",1442934235

you can definitely get 8% interest over the long run with a good liquidity on your cash deployed. To me, it&#x27;s totally worth it for money that you don&#x27;t need in the really short term",1442934030

My contention is that there exists a information-theoretic lower bound on the amount of energy it takes to transmit a given amount of information a given distance.  Like a heat engine, at some point you can no longer make generational improvements in efficiency.  You get asymptotically closer to the bound, you can&#x27;t ever beat it.  And wireless power tends to dominate the power budget of anything that uses it.<p>High-bandwidth signals require more power to travel a given distance, low-bandwidth signals go farther on less power but transmit less information.  Intuitively this is why you can go worldwide with CW (Morse code) on just a few watts of power, while a SSB signal on the same frequency doesn&#x27;t go far at all.  But I think you can mathematically support this by playing with the bandwidth+power terms of the Shannon-Hartley theorem.<p>If we want to transmit a given amount of data per time unit, there are two natural extremes.  We can either transmit it at the average data rate necessary, or we can race-to-sleep by blasting it out as fast as possible.  I&#x27;m not sure which is more efficient given that SNR is inside the log2 of the S-H theorem, it depends on the relationship between SNR and bandwidth as you spread a given quantity of RF power thinner and thinner.  Based on the log2 I would think this is an inverse-square kind of thing, making it an equivalent tradeoff.<p>Showerthoughts: because of the Inverse Square Law, it&#x27;s probably more efficient to make a mesh of multiple small hops than a single long shot.  As the spacing of the mesh decreases to zero, you end up with a wire.<p>Also, check out the ESP8266 chip, it doesn&#x27;t have a BTLE onboard but it does handle the &quot;SOC with low-power wifi&quot; thing.",1442934025

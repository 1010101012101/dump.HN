Long story short: They chose to use the downtime to power down and move both Dell SAN boxes across the aisle (&quot;to make the wiring neater&quot;)- neither of them successfully powered back up (with ~72hr of fingerpointing before Dell admitted no data was going to be recovered). Turns out hosting company had been storing all VPS snapshots _and_ daily filesystem/database backups on those two SANs. ~150 websites ended up being restored from weekly backups (which, of course, were 6 days old - or almost 8 days by the time the &quot;waiting round on Dell to recover the SAN data&quot; plug was pulled).<p>It&#x27;s hard to tell if we were lied to, mis-lead, or just allowed to make untrue assumptions, but we were certainly not expecting both the dailies and the VPS snapshots to all vanish with the same hardware failure...

Some of the points will really hit hard:
&quot;This is still America.  Cash!&quot;
(from the movie &#x27;Seabiscuit&#x27;).<p>Long ago Google was getting more revenue
from outside the US than inside; so,
the article outlines in effect how Google
is in line to take a torpedo in 1/2 + of
their revenue.<p>If my start up works, then I, too, will
have international users.  Chuck Schumer,
listen up:  We&#x27;re talking $ for NY.<p>Here&#x27;s what I think will happen:<p>(1) Nearly
all politicians will run for cover and
keep their heads down, issue cliches and
platitudes, and do nothing important.<p>(2) Legal cases are and will be brought.
E.g., apparently Google is bringing a case.
By now there have to be a lot of people
with &#x27;standing&#x27; to bring cases -- how
about 130 million or so Verizon 
customers?
A standard claim of those cases will be
violation of at least the Fourth 
Amendment.<p>(3) The cases will make it to the
SCOTUS (Supreme Court of the US)
which will accept some of the more
important cases.<p>(4) Whatever opinions the SCOTUS
hands down, bet your last penny that
the SCOTUS will, as a no-brainer,
have
the Constitution and the Fourth
Amendment come out 100% 
iron-clad whole.  For the NSA
behavior, the FISA &#x27;court&#x27;,
the &#x27;Patriot Act&#x27;, expendable!<p>Then all the politicians can
come out of hiding and blame
the SCOTUS and otherwise
philosophize, 
posture, pontificate, genuflect,
etc.<p>But it <i>does</i> help that a <i>lot</i>
of ordinary citizens, at HN,
<i>The Atlantic</i>, EFF, ACLU,
etc. agree with the OP.<p>It also helps that little
Ecuador just told the big,
bad, mean US to take their
NSA and stuff it up their
wherever and, besides, 
stuff the &#x27;trade agreement&#x27;,
and, besides, here&#x27;s $24 million
apparently the US needs to
educate its citizens on the
Constitution.<p>I&#x27;m a fully loyal US citizen,
but I do remember<p>&quot;Amendment I<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the
right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;<p>So, I&#x27;ve got &quot;freedom of speech&quot;.<p>And I don&#x27;t
have to agree with 
some of the worst of W, Cheney,
Obama, Hillary, or, now, 
the guy, what&#x27;s his name,
you know, the one supported
by H. J. Heinz and its 57
varieties, our current
Secretary of State, 
the little hyperflexible
invertebrate
John Kerry,
and to think I voted for that
twit for president.<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you
SCOTUS, the Constitution,
and the founding fathers.
Now we learn again how much
we need you!<p>Jihaders, expect no comfort,
and you will have none.  The
NSA people were never the brightest
bulbs on the tree, and we don&#x27;t
need their new work since 9/11

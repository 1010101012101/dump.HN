I figured for a dataset of that size, the main bottleneck might be not indexing -- maybe RedShift stores row data in a higher-latency medium while keeping indexes in-memory. Curious, I checked the documentation[1] and found this:<p>> Amazon Redshift doesnt require indexes or materialized views and so uses less space than traditional relational database systems.<p>Reading through the rest of their FAQ, it sounds like they echo your conclusion -- RedShift shines the most for use-cases where the dataset is large enough that, to use PostgreSQL, you'd have to shard out multiple instances.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/faqs/#0030"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/faqs/#0030</a>",1360969117

Why do I say this? Well, Twitter's bread and butter is in 140 characters, if they wanted to look at branching out into micro-blogging they wouldn't need to acquire a company, of whom the majority of their customers already use Twitter. (It was borderline a zero-value gain for Twitter if you take out Posterous' talent)<p>As it stands now, Tumblr clearly won (Although there has been a few emerging startups of insignificant size. Soup.io is one that springs to mind that is currently in an accelerator). If you are looking for hosted solutions for your startup's blog (or you are at all technical), I'd <i>genuinely</i> think about using GitHub. Start to pull your posts from Posterous and use a static content generator. Jekyll / Punch / Middleman / Hyde / Korma / nanonc / Frank + (any of the other 10 static generators)..<p>The operative point from using services that generate static content is that you are <i>always</i> in control of your plain-text content. Just push your new post and GitHub will handle your site. If you are worried about traffic on your site or extended build periods (I believe GH does rate limit static sites, and as a comment below mentions, on infrequent occasions builds can take upwards of several hours) then you can still use any other solution... Push to Amazon S3 and proxy through Cloudfront, then you will have probably one of the fastest, geographically distributed blogs on the internet.<p>This was always happening... Especially when you consider that for the last 12 months I haven't seen a single new feature since they were acquired. I've logged in, see the same ""Posterous has been acquired"" header for the last 12 months.<p>Move on, and safeguard your future content.",1360967359

We'll even imagine that we have the ideal spec sitting in front of us, which does everything that anyone will ever need (which isn't going to happen).<p>How can we possibly get there from where we are now? Basically, we can't, for various reasons.<p>Anything that doesn't work on existing deployed web browsers is dead on arrival. If the VM won't work on the vast majority of deployed browsers, then I can't use it. It would take years for JavaScript-only browsers to die off enough that I can use the VM, especially Internet Explorer and various phone / tablet browsers (Android being an obvious problem, since most manufacturers do not release updates, or release them years late).<p>So, if I wanted to use the VM before 2020, I'd have to have a JavaScript-only fallback. I just don't have any other option, because I certainly can't use PNaCl (Chrome-only) or Flash (effectively desktop OS only). If I have a fully functional JavaScript-only solution, which works right now, in all existing browsers, what do I need the VM for?<p>That's assuming that we could possibly get any agreement on a VM. That's never going to happen, for a number of reasons.<p>The only browser manufacturer actually interested in a VM is Google. Hence, they're working on PNaCl. Microsoft, Apple and Mozilla are all against the idea for various reasons, ranging from pragmatic to idealistic.<p>There are far, far too many different ways to do a VM, which depends largely on what languages you want it to run. A VM designed for C / C++ code (which asm.js pretty much is, as is LLVM) is very different from something like the JVM or .NET CLR, which is different from the kind of VM a JavaScript implementation has. Different groups of people want completely different things, which are often diametrically opposed to one another. The kind of VM a game developer would want is completely different than the kind of VM you'd want for developing business applications, and either VM would be essentially useless for the other group.<p>Besides that, what's the point? Modern JavaScript JITs are stupidly fast, even when they have virtually no information about the code they're running (types, in particular). You can already cross-compile a number of languages to JavaScript, which often treat it as a low-level target.<p>Remember, the web is a huge collection of different systems (browsers, servers, websites, development tools, and so on) which really can't just be upgraded in one pop. It has to evolve, and it has to work at every step of the way. If something doesn't work, or isn't usable, it tends to die, even if it was a really good idea.<p>There's one possibility, though:<p>People start using JavaScript as a compilation target. Improvements in JavaScript engines make this approach viable, and reasonably fast. Compilers tend towards using JavaScript in a certain way, which is kind of predictable. Browser manufacturers notice this, examine the subset, and come up with a spec describing it, and a plan for optimizing it. Compilers start producing the standardized subset, and JavaScript VMs gradually start adding optimizations for the subset. Browser vendors start competing with one another for performance, pushing the optimized VM close to native speeds.<p>Then, eventually, someone might take what those browsers are already doing, write a bytecode implementation of it, and a JavaScript shim that turns the bytecode back into JavaScript to support existing browsers. If there's any advantage to it at all, this bytecode would be trivial to adopt in a browser (it's close to what they're already doing), so there's no reason for browser manufacturers to resist it. If there are no advantages to it, nobody will bother.<p>It'll probably end up being a perfectly reasonable feature, based on a design that would be completely insane if you designed it from scratch, but works anyway.",1360966358

The web code can instruct the browser to store that offline, without exposing its implementation-specific details to the web code. The web code can then, in a later session, retrieve that optimized code from storage as another FunctionBlob, which it can then convert into a Function. This is no different from just storing the asm.js source code in offline storage, except it avoids redoing the work of compiling and optimizing the source. (It'd still have to be stored in position-independent format and there might be some back-patching necessary when reloading it.)",1360965656

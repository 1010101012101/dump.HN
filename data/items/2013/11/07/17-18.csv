6691017,comment,6690126,6690737,7,0,calinet6,,,"The answer to your pains, and how it relates to the article and its insights, is that <i>culture is a system.</i><p>In fact, I&#x27;d go so far as to say culture is the root of the organizational tree. It&#x27;s underground and most organizations sort of ignore it, or worse, treat it like it was a hypothetical illusory nuisance they have to lie about to attract rockstars. Ugh.<p>So culture is the root of the system. It defines how people work together, and how people and work are treated. Culture defines the unseen and unmeasurable motivations people rely upon, without which you get exactly the problems you describe: lack of common purpose, lack of knowledge of process, lack of improvement, infighting, game playing, reward seeking. These are all cultural problems.<p>I wholeheartedly agree that this is a sign of major problems in perspective in the US. The anti-pattern here is individualistic-dominated thinking, which doesn&#x27;t accurately describe or solve the problems of an organization of more than one person. It&#x27;s actually painful to watch corporate culture in this country if you have an understanding of systems design and process control, and especially if you apply it to the human systems of which we are all a part. Science has the answers, but no one cares.

This doesn&#x27;t mean Angular doesn&#x27;t scale, or that it can&#x27;t be used to build large apps, but it does explain why it&#x27;s common for different teams to build large Angular apps in totally different ways, using different patterns, etc.<p>Ember on the other hand sets out to establish way more conventions, built right into the framework, for solving problems common to most web apps. These patterns are rigorously battle-tested since everyone is using them, and as such, it&#x27;s easy (once you&#x27;re past the learning curve), to drop into someone else&#x27;s Ember app and know exactly where to go to diagnose a problem. That being said, when these patterns aren&#x27;t helpful for an app&#x27;s specific needs, most of Ember&#x27;s patterns/abstractions are, like Angular, built upon composable primitives that you can use to assemble your own data structures, custom classes, etc., to tailor to your app&#x27;s needs.",1383847082

What is the argument against that from people who still support this legislation?<p>That what you see is not representative, because along with those I see plenty of people that could not get private insurance at <i>any</i> price (e.g., for whom the cost was infinite) due to preexisting conditions that can get health insurance because of the ACA.<p>> Is it denied that prices have gone up in general<p>For like benefits, costs have gone <i>down</i> since the ACA was introduced, in part because of parts of the ACA that went into effect earlier, like the limit on profits which required refunding excess premiums (because health insurance, even prior to the ACA, was not an ideal competitive market but an oligopolistic one in which rents were being extracted, and this was a limit on the rents that could be extracted.)<p>With the minimum benefit levels effective for non-grandfathered plans some low-cost, low-benefit plans are going away. This, on its own, would increase the minimum price of private insurance after this stage of implementation of the ACA above what it was prior to this stage of the implementation. In addition, changes to rules on what factors can be used in price setting have shifted costs so that, compared to what they would be without those rule changes, prices for plans for young, currently healthy individuals have gone up, while prices for everyone else have (again, considering only the effect of that rules change) gone down.<p>Expanding the size of risk pools as the mandate does <i>should</i> slightly reduce overall prices, but that may be a lagging effect since it can&#x27;t be factored in fully without a clear picture of the magnitude and how many people will opt out in favor of paying the penalties for non-insurance.<p>Additionally, subsidies have been made available to people at the low end of the scale to which the individual mandate applies; this doesn&#x27;t help with total costs (ignoring the effect that coverage vs. non-coverage has on total healthcare costs, which is significant in the long term, but not necessarily the short term) but does help with affordability.<p>Even moreso, except in states that opted out of it, Medicaid expansion means a lot of people are getting coverage with no out-of-pocket cost that could not afford any coverage before.<p>But, yes, the people that could afford insurance and who paid the least for the coverage they were getting because of youth and current health are often going to be paying more.",1383847042

But your comment just goes to show that no one has a clue about what the ACA actually does, and it drives me crazy.<p>The ACA <i>does</i> remove that tax exemption, albeit partially. Every dollar above $10k or so ends up being taxed now. And not a small amount, either: the tax is to the tune of 40%. And since the cost of healthcare will continue to rise faster than inflation for the foreseeable future, more and more employer health plans are going to be hitting that number.<p>I&#x27;d certainly prefer the tax exclusion to disappear entirely, but the ACA is nothing if not an attempt to offer coverage to the poor and people with pre-existing conditions while doing the minimum possible to disrupt the healthcare market. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a bit of a Frankenstein: no one in their ideal world would have chosen the ACA as their ideal policy. But given the set of institutional actors and the setup of our government, it may well be the best that was possible. That&#x27;s how the Obama administration thought of it, at least.<p>IIRC that tax was actually a pretty nasty fight between the Obama administration and labor unions, who get their members relatively good benefits and will be hit disproportionately by it. And you know what? The tax-free cap may well have been significantly lower with Republican input. But they chose to put 100% of their efforts into making a mediocre law fail than trying to turn it into a good or great one.<p>Apologies for the angry rant.",1383846913

In it, we&#x27;re all equal individuals; power is used situationally, in a bottom-up fashion, by those who are currently accomplishing something for the common good. In those contexts, top-down exercise of power feels very interfering.<p>The US&#x27;s history includes a strong dose of that, plus a strong sense of individual liberty. Our country was born in rebellion to some far-away people who wanted to boss us around. Almost everybody here is descended from somebody who said, &quot;Fuck this country; I&#x27;m outta here,&quot; and moved to America. One of our central civic documents, the Bill of Rights, basically lists all the things the federal government can&#x27;t do. A giant chunk of our national mythos is bound up in westward expansion, where in a thinly populated frontier, the cowboy-hero did what he wanted and bowed to no man. Never mind that the era was short and the story more complicated; it&#x27;s the idea that lives on.<p>Most  of us who live in cities have long ago accepted the need for modest civic organization and collective action. We live too close to one another to be able to pretend that every man is an island. But even here, we tend to jealously guard our independence. Much more so in the suburbs and in rural America, where interdependence is harder to see.<p>Given all that, a demand that you buy health insurance can easily seem like (or be made to seem like) a crazy imposition from a far-off bureaucracy. Most other tax in the US is based on income, assets, or expenditures; if you aren&#x27;t making/owning/spending anything, you don&#x27;t have to pay. To some this feels like being dragged into participation in a society that they never particularly wanted to be part of.<p>All of that is intensified by several factors. A big one is the Republican party&#x27;s strong shift rightward [1]. There is also a large segment on the right that has decided that the black guy with the funny name is not an American [2], making anything he does seem more like an imposition. Plus, there&#x27;s a long tradition [3] of painting this as &quot;us&quot; (that is, white people) paying for &quot;them&quot; (black and brown people), even though the federal government actually shifts a lot of money from liberal states to conservative ones [4]. There are also strong streaks of anti-intellectualism and fundamentalist religion that play into this.<p>All that said, I agree it&#x27;s kinda crazy when you take the bigger picture into account. America&#x27;s health care system is a mess, costing way more than anybody else&#x27;s, and leaving millions with little or no service. Something has to be done. This solution was actually a conservative one [5], and it&#x27;s not like the American right has proposed anything better. It&#x27;s not the solution I would have picked on my own, but given current American politics, I think it was the most achievable option.<p>Ok.

Then Twitter has demonstrated value for &quot;normals,&quot;<p>Look there are people that watch the nightly news every night. Enough people and enough value to advertisers that there is the nightly news. Forgetting though that that market is declining they have a monetization platform in place (partly by legacy because they were the only source of information so it just lives on) and partly because the format is such (tv commercials) that it provides value for advertisers.<p>The question with twitter is simply how much value can be delivered long term to people that follow (as one example) breaking news. And how much that can be monetized and become a profitable business model.<p>By the way part of CNN is the entertainment value that can keep an audience captivated for hours watching every last minute of storm or conflict or invasion coverage.

You&#x27;ll be surprised how often stuff gets in there that you don&#x27;t remember liking (you may be an exception and keep it very curated, most people do not).  Facebook can target you based on any one of the pieces of information on your profile, which includes everything Twitter tracks, plus the additional fields.  This doesn&#x27;t even go into Partner Categories, which you cannot avoid being a part of, Custom Audiences from companies whose email list you are on, and Lookalike Audiences where you show up as similar to customers on another companies email lists (none of which Twitter offers).  While you can target users on Twitter based on what they tweet about, something I don&#x27;t believe Facebook offers yet, that is something that I would be shocked if Facebook doesn&#x27;t roll it out.  From my experience using both platforms, the one major targeting option Twitter offers that I&#x27;m not sure if Facebook is near being able to offer is sentiment analysis (you can target based on positive or negative feelings on a given topic).

They were in YC and I think they are a great choice for the flow you mentioned. We&#x27;re quite different from them (while we&#x27;re still addressing the same problem).<p>The address_line 1 is not necessary to get an accurate quote. However, it is necessary to generate a label that you&#x27;ll need for sending the package. You&#x27;ll have to be careful to enter the correct address. FedEx charges extra afterwards for address corrections. Our goal was to build an API that allows you to get accurate quotes without having to enter a lot of data. However for the final label purchase the exact address will be necessary.<p>UPS/FedEx etc. don&#x27;t allow you to pass on your account to people that are not directly connected with your business. I assume that is what you meant by &quot;messy.&quot; If you still want to do that stripe connect is certainly a good choice. This is exactly what we&#x27;re working on - to get contracts with courier services to eliminate this problem.<p>About the flow that we had envisioned for our service:\ncustomers choose the product they want to buy -> tell us in which country they live -> we show them all available courier services -> they chose the servicelevel that suits their needs best (fastest, cheapest, whatever) -> check out -> the label is directly sent to the vendor -> vendor sticks it on the package -> brings it to the post office/gets pickup (vendor can specify if only pickups are allowed & which day is best for pick up) -> done (all through API)<p>Just email me at laura(at)goshippo.com if you have any more questions.

Some were rails, some were not. We wanted to add memcached to the rails apps via cache-money[1]. That&#x27;ll handle read-through/write-through caching for vanilla rails stuff, but we had to somehow invalidate the cache for updates that happen outside of ActiveRecord::Base#save (e.g. update_all, or a write from a non-rails system). In the end, we settled upon the same approach[2] as in the article.<p>The trigger-backed cache invalidator was also written in ruby, and knew from rails/cache-money what key(s) needed to be invalidated when it got a notification. IIRC you didn&#x27;t need to do anything special when you added a new cache key (e.g. cache user lookups by username), since the invalidator would just know what to do.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/nkallen/cache-money"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nkallen/cache-money</a><p>[2] This was actually on 8.4, so unfortunately there was no NOTIFY.

6690768,comment,6690126,6690126,2,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"I definitely agree with all of the sentiments in the blog post.  With the exception of daily scrum (we do twice weekly), we try to follow all of these habits.  There always seem to be two things which we run into though;  superficial code reviews and haphazard integration.<p>On the code review side, I find that most engineers look for trivial crap that could normally be picked up by running lint.  It&#x27;s nice to have similar lint-y style, but for me, the most important things to look for are whether the code is going to break with unexpected input (ie. is the logic sound and are the unit tests good enough), and did the engineer write in an idiomatic style which would be easy for other engineers to understand.  I don&#x27;t mind comments like &quot;maybe use this other variable name&quot;, however using recognizable patterns which allow other engineers to easily follow the logic is much more important.  Often it seems like people get lazy during reviews and write really superficial comments instead of taking the time to really get down and dirty in another person&#x27;s code.\nAnd why would they?  They&#x27;ve got their own code to write.<p>The other thing I feel like I&#x27;m always up against, particularly with younger engineers (sorry younger engineers!) is not thinking through all of the integration points when your code needs to work with other code which is being developed concurrently.  One engineer will say something like &quot;Oh, just call function X&quot;, which when you do, doesn&#x27;t provide the functionality which the other engineer was claiming it had.  That, or there was some additional step which one engineer wasn&#x27;t being explicit about and there was an assumption that you were going to take care of it.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than finding this out on the last day of the sprint when you&#x27;re trying to button everything up.",1383845415

6690650,comment,6688842,6690225,3,0,Bostwick,,,"> You can&#x27;t write cli applications in a JVM language because the start-up time is too slow. Which means you can&#x27;t compose scripts that call Java apps.<p>You&#x27;re right. In the case of small, fast applications designed to be called as part of shell scripts, the JVM does suffer start-up costs. Some testing on my personal machine shows the JVM to be 2x to 8x slower than a comparable Ruby or Python script in startup time. [1] Depending on the script, that startup time may or may not acceptable, and if the script runs for longer than a second, which is entirely possible for anything that goes beyond the local machine, the JVM will get progressively faster.<p>> This is not just 1 type of application, it&#x27;s the most important type of application by far.<p>This needs more explanation. I&#x27;ve used Unix for many years, and I&#x27;ve definitely bought in to its philosophy of small and composable; It&#x27;s a philosophy that in many ways mirrors functional programming. However, in my opinion, the most important type of application varies considerably by person. For you, the small, single-purpose \napplications may be what you use most.<p>And I agree, if you&#x27;re programming for the Unix platform, the JVM would not be the best choice. Unix was built on C. A program that builds on that platform is probably a better choice.<p>But there are many more applications out there, and for any command-line program that operate in a time domain longer than 10 seconds, the JVM startup costs are mostly eliminated. This time-domain is very plausible for a command that operates on medium-scale databases or anything with network connectivity.<p>It&#x27;s silly to completely dismiss an entire platform because it is not the absolute best choice for a single domain of programs.<p>I&#x27;m curious: What do you do where the short-lived, composable Unix functions are the most important programs?<p>[1] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/bostwick/8ee1d4df9c7743f9efed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/bostwick/8ee1d4df9c7743f9efed</a>",1383844653

If the table is empty, I can easily recreate the data, so I don&#x27;t care about any kind of WAL logging or replication. If the table&#x27;s there, perfect. I&#x27;ll use it instead of a ton of joins and an equally big amount of application logic.<p>If the data isn&#x27;t there, well. Then I run that application logic which will cause the joins to happen. So that&#x27;s way, way slower, but it&#x27;ll work the same.<p>The advantage of using an unlogged table here is that it&#x27;s cheaper to update it and it doesn&#x27;t use replication traffic (unlogged tables are not replicated).",1383844314

I&#x27;ll probably be integrating with EasyPost to start.  Here are some thoughts:<p>I need an API so a vendor can print labels from my site. I want one-click shipping so that they get 1) a label 2) billed 3) pickup.  Speed is important to my vendors.  Most of them bill hourly and think of their time that way so anything that reduces time per job is a big deal.<p>My flow looks like:<p>Customer enters specs and shipping info for a price quote -> Vendor responds with a quote including shipping<p>If all goes well, I&#x27;ll also do instantaneous pricing for certain machining processes.  Unless I missed something in the docs, EasyPost apparently does not do quotes based solely on zip/dimensions/weight and I never got a response from support when I asked.  For me, this means that to get a shipping quote, customers also need to enter at least an &quot;address_line1&quot;.  There may be a business/technical reason for this, but I&#x27;m worried that having to enter that additional piece of personally-identifying info on my site will be a dealbreaker for first-time customers while I&#x27;m starting up.<p>For my use case, I&#x27;d like to see Stripe Connect functionality for shipping: vendors sign up for shipping through OAuth and then I interact with the shipping service on behalf of each vendor.  On EasyPost, it appears that a UPS/Fedex/USPS/whatever\naccount is tied to the EasyPost account.  It was suggested that I bill vendors for shipping and go through my own carrier accounts, but this seems messy.<p>If you could address some concerns for marketplaces in the future, I&#x27;d be pretty happy.",1383844194

This wasn&#x27;t an unfortunate bug, &quot;oh we meant to do all we could to keep your data safe&quot; it was a deliberate design decision.<p>Dishonesty and shadiness was the problem. When finally they started shipping with better defaults, did we see an apology? Was anyone responsible terminated? Nope. Don&#x27;t remember.<p>Now, it could all be a statistics fluke and people randomly all decided to bash MongoDB, say, more than Basho, Cassandra, PostgreSQL, HBase and other database products? Odd isn&#x27;t it.  Or, isn&#x27;t it more rational, that it isn&#x27;t quite random, there is a reason for it.<p>When developers sell to developers, it is expected a certain level of honesty. If I claim I am building a credit card processing API but I deliberately add a feature that randomly double charges to gain extra performance, you should be very upset about. Yes, it is in the documentation, on page 156, that says in fine print &quot;oh yeah enable safe transaction, should have read that&quot;. And you as a result should probably never buy or use my product and stop trusting me with credit card processing from them on.<p>The bottom line is, they are probably good guys to have beers with but I wouldn&#x27;t trust them with storing data.",1383843807

Because the stakes are much lower the home-builders will hire smaller contractors.<p>On commercial work-sites only large contractors ever get any jobs because of the guarantees they bring.<p>Also take a look at statistics, immigrants are more likely to start a small business than white people.  Their tendency to start businesses would automatically steer those who do go the construction route into the residential sector.<p>Anecdote - I had a friend who started his own construction business doing a specific subset of drywall (which also happened to be dirt simple), and made well over 6 figures within a year by simply doing it very efficiently.<p>Further, having at one point in my life (when I was much younger) done construction in both residential and commercial, while commercial does pay better than residential if you&#x27;re an employee, the potential in residential is huge if you become a contractor.",1383843675

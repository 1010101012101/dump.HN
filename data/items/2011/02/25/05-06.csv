That usually meant an Oracle database, and Oracle would only really scale vertically, so you had to spend even more <i>up front</i> on hardware that was powerful enough to scale.<p>Implementing Oracle on Sun wasn't something that most people (even good programmers) could do themselves, so they hired consulting companies, which cost even more.<p>Now, you <i>might</i> pay $5-10K to outsource an iPhone app. Then, you'd easily pay $100K just to get your database implemented, and easily that again for licence fees for your web software (Vignette anyone?).<p>Now, you pay $20/month for a basic EC2 setup, knowing you can scale it out horizontally. Back then you'd pay $50K <i>up front</i> for Sun hardware that would support the traffic you might get.<p>I don't know anything about the example given (DealPilot.com), but I do know that now days something that could run on shared hosting in 1997 could be hosted for close to free [1] now. That's still more than 10x less that $100/month.<p>I would also point out that developing an app for the iPhone costs $99 if you do it yourself (which appears to be how they built DealPilot.com), so that is <i>still</i> more than 10x less than $100/month over a year.<p>Lets compare costs for a year:<p>1997: $100/month = $1200, plus $3000 for server = $4200 (I assume there were hosting costs for the server, but I'll assume they were similar to the $100/month for shared hosting)<p>2011: $20/month for EC2 hosting (being conservative here - EC2 would let the company start off a lot cheaper than this and scale expenses as revenue grew) + $99 Apple fee = $339<p>[1] Free hosting examples include: Google AppEngine up to its free tier, Amazon's free EC2 offer.

I know you weren't speaking for other countries, but salaries are a lot 'flatter' over here.<p>Contractors will be earning at that level without too much difficulty but for a typical full-time employee to be earning $100K in London, say, they'd need to be an experienced manager or be into the 15+ year point of their career in my experience.

Still, I can't help but think that while these refinements limit the trips made wandering about the heap, there still are a good number of times when all of those gigabytes of pages still have to be marched through CPU caches displacing active work to check on things that haven't changed status.  Perhaps with enough cores, some of them are simply left alone that vast majority of the time to do productive work with data in cache.  I'd like to see some measurements of this, and how the effectiveness is affected by worker threads vs CPU cores available, as well as how many background GC threads there are.  Data, anybody???<p>At any rate, the defaults for Java are slower than those for Perl when doing many string operations on a single thread.

Top firms have cut summer programs or significantly scaled them back which has a trickle down effect--the top candidates usually took jobs at top firms.

Sometimes, because of Wikia's often-abusive policies, communities will decide to move their wiki off Wikia and host it separately.<p>But Wikia will refuse to remove the original wiki even if all the contributors want to move it, in order to maximize advertising revenue.  This means that it's nearly impossible to get the new wiki to rank highly on Google, even if all links across the internet are changed to point to the new wiki, because Wikia's pagerank is so high that Google deems the new one to be a ""copy"". <i>This is why Wikia moved all their wikis to subdomains: in order to piggyback on the pagerank of the main site.</i><p>As a result there are a ton of long-dead wikis on Wikia that still get more search traffic than the active equivalent.  Obviously this hurts users, since they get long-outdated information as a result.<p>In short, once a wiki is placed on Wikia, it's basically impossible to ever move it anywhere else because of Google's anti-duplicate biasing.<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikia#Controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikia#Controversy</a> for more info.",1298610534

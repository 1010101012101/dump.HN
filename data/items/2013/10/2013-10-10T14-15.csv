If your eyes are telling you that you are falling but your stomach and ear canals are telling you that you are still sat on your arse in your mom&#x27;s basement then you just might start feeling sick. Improved gyros in the headset are not going to magically create some anti-gravity field for you, are they?<p>As for the &#x27;you have not tried this particular brand of VR headset and therefore you don&#x27;t know what you are on about&#x27;, line of argument, true I have not tried these particular VR headset novelty devices yet. However, I have also yet to try a 2013 model 3D TV but, from having seen how the 2010 3D TV&#x27;s had their failings I can fairly predict that the 2013 3D TV&#x27;s have not addressed the fundamental failings that the 2010 models had and are therefore unlikely to take the market by storm.<p>I am merely sharing the same level of scepticism that the BBC had regarding this particular product:<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23877695"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23877695</a><p>We have seen it all before and people just don&#x27;t want to wear some clumsy headset in their living room, whether that is to watch a movie, to be &#x27;in&#x27; a game or anything else.

IIRC, they wanted metadata from his communications: email titles, recipient email addresses, time of transmission, etc. Lavabit was designed in a way that this was impossible. Levinson would have had to implement a system that flagged particular users and then saved metadata before encryption.<p>In a production, business environment, this isn&#x27;t just a one-liner.

6528061,comment,6526098,6526968,2,0,claudius,,,"> You&#x27;re right, but as you point out that&#x27;s not standard. It&#x27;s not usually directly integrated in your mail client. It&#x27;s just a hack. NNTP clients have all that baked in.<p>While not standardised, I expect any decent e-mail client to handle mailing lists mostly automatically at least in that regard, e.g. Claws-Mail builds a nice menu from List-* headers. It is true that one usually needs to manually add filtering on the server side (in Sieve, maildrop or whatever you use), which is not as nice as the standard handling of news, but you can even automatise that if you’re willing to have emails containing random headers create the corresponding folders (which, of course, you shouldn&#x27;t do).<p>> I don&#x27;t think NNTP requires more infrastructure on the server side (installing mailman vs. installing a NNTP daemon) but you&#x27;re right that it does require installing a client on the client side (since everybody already has a mail client anyway.<p>Most email clients also have NNTP support baked in, so the client side is not really an issue. However, newsservers have to keep at least a rolling archive of messages and possibly federate with others, whereas a mailman installation is mostly stand-alone and doesn’t even have to keep an archive if you don’t want to.",1381417055

It (theoretically) keeps costs down and makes the contractor more appealing for future work.  It skews the actuals all to hell, though, because on paper it looks like a project took X hours when it actually took 1.2X hours because everyone was working an average of 48 hours a week but only billing 40.  In some cases it can skew even worse.  I had a couple workaholic co-workers who regularly put in 25+ unpaid extra hours.<p>The government doesn&#x27;t particularly like this, but they usually don&#x27;t clamp down on the practice.

6527979,comment,6527104,6527557,5,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;I had some exposure to Lisp in school way back when, and had to do some work in Scheme. I hated it. Strong dislike! So what was I missing? It seems these have a strong following compared with how widespread they are.&quot;<p>I can say that Lisp made my current project possible, given the timeframe we had and the requirements.  Here are a few things that make Lisp fantastic:<p>* Flexibility/expressiveness:  you can compose things as needed, without being held back by syntax rules.  Here is a simple example, which is a bit silly but which illustrates the point:<p><pre><code>  (if (defun foo (x) (+ x 5)) &#x27;yes &#x27;no)\n</code></pre>\nThat is an &quot;if&quot; statement that follows the &quot;yes&quot; branch if the function is compiled without errors, and follows the &quot;no&quot; branch if there is an error.  A bit pedantic, but let&#x27;s put it this way:  good luck doing that in C, C++, Java, or even Python.<p>* Error handling:  What happens when you are writing to a file, but you run out of disk space?  In Java and Python, you are out of luck:  an exception is thrown, and now you have to pick up the pieces.  In C or C++, your code needs to be littered with conditional statements that check if your I/O operations are successful.  In Common Lisp, however, we have the <i>restart</i> construct, which allows the <i>thrower</i> of an exception to set up recovery routines that the <i>handler</i> can invoke.  The top-level exception handler can present the user with recovery options, so for something like running out of disk space, the user might delete some files and invoke a restart that continues the I/O -- and the programmer need not clutter his code with routines for restarting the operation.<p>* Serialization is free.  Kind of a pedantic point when you have things like Pickle, but it is even easier in Lisp -- no libraries needed.  The caveat, though, is that <i>some</i> data cannot be serialized so easily, like objects in CLOS, but the metaobject protocol in most CL implementations solves that problem (A MOP are strangely absent from the Lisp standard, but most implementations include one anyway).<p>* Macros.  When all else fails, macros are a lifesaver.  Macros in Lisp have all the power of the Lisp programming language itself, at compile time -- so everything mentioned above is equally applicable.  There is a strange recursive phenomenon to this argument:  when all else fails in macro writing, you can create a deeper level of macros (it&#x27;s macros all the way down).  Macros are the reason for Lisp&#x27;s unusual syntax, by the way:  Lisp programs are written in a way that makes it easy for a macro to operate on a Lisp program.<p>Now, there are certainly things I do not like about CL, like the lack of any portable support for static typing (even an optional static type system), the poor collection of standard data structures, and the lack of support for modern things like sockets, threads, etc.  Fortunately there are a lot of freely available libraries for such things, but a new standard that included them would be nice.",1381415966

Look at the sheer number of patents the company holds; we can debate patent law until the end of days, but in the meantime, it is worth looking at the things that Microsoft brought to market.  And then look at Microsoft Research, which produces literally thousands of peer-reviewed academic papers every year, dealing with numerous advancements in technology.<p>Ford is an interesting example.  Arguably, without Ford&#x27;s advancements in manufacturing, automation, and mass industrialization, we don&#x27;t get the modern car, which unquestionably has made nuclear power possible.  In a very Civilization way, you can&#x27;t get to nuclear power without modern transportation.<p>So what you seem to be suggesting is a counterfactual world where some other software (let&#x27;s say Apples, for argument&#x27;s sake) rose to prominence instead of Microsoft.  It is possible that they might also have done an amazing job of putting a PC on every desk.  But we have no way of knowing that and what we do know, in the reality in which we currently live, that Microsoft did an excellent job of pushing computing out of the lab and into the home.<p>And there seems to me to be decent evidence that we&#x27;ll continue to make those sort of innovations that push technology forward.  While you&#x27;re welcome to call me &quot;silly&quot;, I think saying that Microsoft has introduced absolutely no advancements to the marketplace is silly.

If I call add(get_number(x), get_number(y)), I know that a and b are going to be ints, but the compiler might be unable to infer this, depending on how complex get_number is.

It fits a convenient size suitable for the medium (1-10 paragraphs). Rather than responding to the substantive point of the post, critics nit-pick some obscure point which the author glossed over precisely because more detail runs at odds to the medium. To wit: the criticism amounts to demands for peer-reviewed scientific process with rock-solid presentation & references, when said critic would in no way actually read such material.<p>Gladwell&#x27;s (and many other writers&#x27;, ex.: <i>1491</i> and <i>A History Of The World In Six Glasses</i>) works are like this. The books are not weighty tomes, they are not peer-reviewed, they are not scientific papers with rigorous analysis of the material. They are lightweight overviews of interesting insights, appealing to many people (enough so that some expend energy loudly criticizing the works), and providing launching points for those so motivated to further pursue the subject (such as the would-be pro golfer testing the &quot;10,000 hours&quot; theory by <i>actually doing it</i>). If Gladwell et al wrote books the way critics demand, critics (and pretty much everyone else) would <i>never</i> bother reading them.<p>&quot;<i>the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.</i>&quot; - Ratatouille",1381414724

Plus, the &quot;Handles&quot; keyword makes coding event-driven OOP objects quite pleasant.<p>My only problems with VB are the non-short-circuiting Boolean operators (so you have to write AndAlso and OrElse for short-circuit instead of And and Or), the bizarre +1 array sizing (but you should be using lists instead of arrays anyways so it doesn&#x27;t matter) and the anachronistic Dim keyword.

To match Russia (accounting for population), the 200 richest Americans would have to own $19 trillion in assets, the average wealth would have to be about $100 billion and you&#x27;d see some trillionaires.<p>Looking at the net worth of the bottom 40% of the American population doesn&#x27;t tell you much about the level of oligarchy in American society. You would expect a big chunk of the population to not have much in the way of assets, simply because the trajectory of peoples&#x27; lives is to build up assets as they age over time.

We know our brains were initially created entirely by biological evolution; what&#x27;s not clear is how direct or indirect the influence of evolution has been on our psychology. That is, does evolution hardwire relatively complex behaviour (as it does in many animals) or does it merely specify high-level learning algorithms? This appears to be the case with humans - we don&#x27;t have many instinctual behaviours compared with other animals, but we do have an instinctual ability to learn new things. It&#x27;s interesting to speculate how this ability might have arisen; the ability to learn new things and to spot patterns must have been useful to our distant ancestors, as they&#x27;re such fundamental traits of human cognition.<p>This is also why the &quot;nature vs nurture&quot;/&quot;biology vs culture&quot; debate is a false dichotomy: the foundation of human culture is our ability to learn, which is itself a genetic adaptation.",1381414066

We learned to avoid certain PHP features or built workarounds on top of them. Therefore I still hate the PHP for that. &quot;extract&quot; function anyone?",1381413694
6527712,comment,6527104,6527482,0,0,homersapien,,,"PHP haters are hysterical, I mean that in the clinical sense.  It is powerful, flexible, blazing fast (relative, I know), and arguably the easiest (or at least most accessible) language to learn.  Its flexibility is what generates most of the hate.  It gives you the freedom to create some really bad/stupid code, which noobs inevitably do.  But hating it because it will let you hurt yourself is like hating a table saw because it can cut your arm off.",1381413665

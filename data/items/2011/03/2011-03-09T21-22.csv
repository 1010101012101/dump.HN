2306689,comment,2305353,2305705,0,0,not_me,,,"Thomas,<p>You're sorta not understanding what goes on in a verifone device. I would advise actually constructing and inserting a rogue verifone PED, it is non-trivial.<p>First, understand that when you swipe your card at mcdonalds, you're not trusting the guy behind the counter, the manager, the district or anyone else physically present or even mcdonalds. you're not trusting their malware laiden office computers, nor their network, et cetera. You're trusting the terminal. And the terminals, depending on model and service/etc, all have cryptographic MAC addresses ""that are burned in"" (lol), and they're externally by verifone. So first hurdle is that you can't just get a job at mcdonalds and ebay your way to a better life, when you switch out the device, it gets detected and blocked, and i imagine once the burger flippers figure out that its not broken and someone tried to own them, they pull the cameras, et cetera.<p>Next, the device has a myriad of tamper-detection qualities which make it non-trivial to get into and still have the damned thing still function. This is again, dependent on which device is in play and so on-- getting in successfully obviously can be done, but you're getting sorta specialized. Next, the card details/pin/etc all get encrypted at the device never to see plain-text again until it's ""safely in the cloud"".<p>That's the theory anyways, there's some problems but it's not that joe bubblegum is gonna download an 'app' and extract my credit card details from his employers iphone. If pressed for an opinion, I'd say the entire idea of getting people used to paying by swiping their cards through some guys phone is maligned and going to be horribly problematic. This is sorta like SSL, there's another maligned trust heirarchy that exists and makes sense sorta.<p>So, basically my point is, verifone is not entirely incorrect here. It's not that ""a little white card skimmer dongle is trivial to construct"" or any other hyperbole. A PED or other input device that I can dump my card info from is a problem.<p>There's another entire trust relationship going on here which everyone seems to skip: the most common use-case of dealing with a representative of a third-party who is less trustworthy than the third-party itself ('Alice meet George, embassary of Bob, don't mind the collasped veins, he's legit!').",1299707970

Is there any precedent that would lead you to think we would want names & emails, or have any intent of spamming anyone for that matter?  The reason the 3 of us choose to join forces on this project is because we all try and engage with entrepreneurs, not market at them.<p>I am sorry if you have had a negative experience in the past with sponsors, but this offer my friend is a genuine one.  Last year we attended multiple BarCamps and had an absolute blast, the feedback that we got from the communities was overwhelming appreciation and hope that we would come back again next year.<p>We are not asking for everything, in fact we only want to be involved with what you need help with.  I think its so AMAZING that you have such overwhelming support from sponsors in your community, but in our experience there are still tons of barcamps struggling to solve a few pain points. Or in some cases (like BC Charlotte), they don't even want our monetary support but just wanted us to come participate and meet their community.<p>The bottom line is, this is something new and we are going to make mistakes & learn as we go.

The amount of money they will make out of this will be peanuts, far less than they will need to spend in marketing to developers to keep them off new and rising platforms.

A subscription web service is easiest and simplest for me, but if I go that route I would have to charge much more than I would for, say, an iPhone app with similar functionality (since the web app calls the user's phone, potentially many times per day, and a local app would probably not have so many ongoing costs).<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts on 1) whether this idea is worth pursuing and 2) if so, in what format?<p>Many thanks!",1299707350

This was a great way to discover new movies, but according to them only 2% of their userbase cared.  So a few months ago I built this web app to recreate that and more.<p>My goal was for sign-up to be as simple as possible.  I don't even ask for your email (maybe I should though?).  When you connect your Netflix account it pulls in your ratings/reviews.  When you connect your Twitter and/or Facebook, it'll find your friend's profiles and follow them.<p>This was my first attempt at creating something in Python on Google App Engine.  Having to denormalize everything was a challenge, but it seems to be working and the Task Queue came in handy.  Supposedly it will now scale to millions of users.  Good ol' premature optimization.<p>The Netflix API is kind of a pain, in that they don't provide a direct way to get all your ratings.  For the initial import, I have to check every title you've ever  rented/watched/queued to see if it has a rating.  There also isn't any date information associated with your old ratings :(<p>I hope to find better ways to encourage people to share the site with friends.  So far hardly anyone follows anyone, merely using it as a backup.  This site is a lot more interesting with friends.  I even have browser extensions that show your friend's ratings within Netflix.com<p>Any suggestions/feedback is appreciated.  Thanks!",1299707148

As a CTO who had decided to build everyone on top of free software, they wanted to know what it take to make me to switch to a Microsoft stack.  I told them they were 10 years too late.  You see, I made the decision to use LAMP stack not because it was cheaper, but because it's what I knew.  And the reason I knew LAMP stack was because that's all I could afford when I was 15.  The question for Apple isn't whether businesses or experienced developers can afford their development tools, it's the teenagers they should care about.  And while, $5 is still well within the average teenagers reach, it's still a lot more friction than free.  This decision seems short sighted to me even if the effects of it aren't immediately apparent.",1299706651

From what you describe, it seems to me that the use cases for monads and macros have some overlap.<p>Take the OP's example for the Writer monad, in which several functions needed to return a debug string ""<function name> was called"" in addition to their main return value. If I had these two functions+:<p><pre><code>  (def sine (x)
    [(Math.sin x) ""sine was called""])

  (def cube (x)
    [(* x x x) ""cube was called""])

I might write a macro like the following (rather than a monad) to abstract away their common pattern:<p><pre><code>  (mac defWriter (name parms body...)
    `(def ,name ,parms
       [,@body (+ ,name "" was called."")]))
</code></pre>
And then each function's definition could be written more concisely:<p><pre><code>  (defWriter sine (x)
    (Math.sin x))

  (defWriter cube (x)
    (* x x x))

It turns out that he'd had a bug in his code, and the music we'd been hearing was the program playing itself: interpreting its own code as music data.<p>What was surprising, though, was how coherent it actually sounded as music. There was, for example, a perceptible beat. We always wondered whether this was due to the structure of the executable code, or because of the way the program interpreted its data. Unfortunately he was never able to reproduce the bug in quite the same way.<p>[1] ""RealTime"" for the Atari ST, see <a href=""http://tamw.atari-users.net/realtime.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tamw.atari-users.net/realtime.htm</a>",1299705832

2306392,comment,2305001,2305874,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"Agreed. The OP conflates <i>significance</i> and <i>urgency</i>. There a many things that are extremely important, yet there is no need to attend to them at a given moment.<p>The OP defeats a straw man. He argues against complete deprivation of sleep, yet his conclusion is based on sleep that isn't <i>limited</i> at all. Proving that something can't be done without entirely is far removed from proving that we can't cut back a bit.<p>He might be right, but for an article intended to be persuasive, he does a bad job of supporting his thesis.",1299704650

Whenever I pushed the issue, he would always fly into a panic, and then seized by some mad other-worldy inspiration, delete all his code and start over <i>only much better this time</i>.<p>Due to all sorts of psychological quirks that I suspect are more common in programmers than the general population, the kind of synergy described in the article is rarer than you might think.",1299704478

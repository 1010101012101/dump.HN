5172470,comment,5171957,5171957,3,0,tristan_juricek,,,"Using syncing as a developer makes sense to me because syncing or backup is not versioning.<p>Versioning (using git) is about marking state at a period of time. Such that, in the future, you can go back to that important state, and that state means something.<p>Backup, syncing, they just solve different problems. They might have backups, but those backups rarely mean something. Other than, ""well I thought it worked tuesday"".<p>I see this is as ""different by design"". I want Dropbox to make the same shit show up everywhere. I want git to manage versions and streams of work, often coordinating with other people. Using the dropbox workflow with other people sucks if people make changes (I have to often ask, ""hey wait, what did you do"".) Using the git workflow to sync with other devices sucks because I have to remember to tell it what to do.",1360090767

When I left Sun in '95 to do a startup (GolfWeb) one of the things we were planning on doing was a custom currency so that you could ""subscribe"" to the online magazine, and we'd deduct currency out of your subscription for each article you read, and tag it so that you could go back an re-read it whenever you wanted. Then when you currency got low you could 're-subscribe'. We felt it would be cool because you could make it the Golf Magazine you wanted to read rather than what an Editor-in-Chief decided to put in the issue that month.

I remember saying ""Wow, 20 years from now this is going to be something cool.""<p>And here we are. In 2011 a number of David Chaum's patents expired. Of course there are interesting new patents that Amazon just got  like this one: <a href=""http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=2&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=digicash&OS=digicash&RS=digicash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sec...</a><p>But Amazon has been aggressive in their patent defense for years.<p>Creating their system to be one coin == one cent is also interesting as it effectively kills off the remainder grab [1]. Especially true since the balance apparently combines in your account. Basically you 'top up' with coins when ever you want. So really it has utility of shifting the payment processing charges around. It also touches a grey area of taxation, which is when you buy something for ""points"" how much tax to do you pay and to whom?<p>[1] Pre paid phone cards that can't be re-filled would not make a call if you had $1.00 or less on the card so they became worthless with up to a $1 of un-spent value on them.

Yes, a lot of this being overseas, but that's much less problem for a private company than a public one. So we're really paying $13.1 billion for the assets.<p>Assets which in 2012 produced a 7.3% un-levered ROA (earnings before interest after taxes / assets) and are levered only 5x (assets / equity) in historically low rates (Lenovo is 6.7x). Not to say this is anything close to a slam dunk. But the pressure of working to make the next interest payment isn't so dissimilar from slaving to your next fund-raise.<p>Note the difference between capital and money, assets and liabilities, stuff and claims. Companies are arrangements of capital, physical and intellectual. If the value of that arrangement is zero or negative one liquidates, i.e. shuffles the capital around without changing its value while marking down the claims to show the presumed valuable arrangement has vaporised. The inverse of liquidation is entrepreneurship, i.e. shuffling capital into an arrangement of value. When this is successful the claims are marked up to reflect the arrangement's value.<p>Capital has inertia - shuffling it around takes energy, e.g. recruiting costs for intellectual capital. ABCD -> AB + C + D takes less effort than E + F + G + H -> EFGH. We only liquidate when there is nobody willing to pay for the arrangement. Similarly, we only build when there is nobody selling it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/826083/000082608312000019/dellq3fy1310q.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/826083/00008260831200...</a>",1360089540

With a pure git solution I'd have to push changes that may or may not be a fully coherent change set each time I switched machines.<p>Anyway, my point is that all of the OP's arguments are still valid when you are using git+dropbox, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to expect to do.<p>FWIW, all of the major sync systems have issues here (my biggest pet peeve with Live Mesh was that it would hold locks on files for an abnormally long time which would stop me from being able to compile while .o files were being synced, for example).  But Dropbox's probably are the most annoying since you have so little control over what does and doesn't sync beyond the root sync directory.",1360089346

They weren't the answers you like in hindsight, but they were correct insofar as the model was vetted & the input was correct.<p>I can't believe you are seriously arguing this.  According to you, ratings agencies have no responsibility for the accuracy of their models as long as they fit historical data.  By this logic, it's ""correct"" to rate Greek bonds at AAA right now because they have never defaulted before (this is a simple and completely accurate model that fits past data).

When those predictions are wrong, it's on them.  It's not reasonable to give a AAA rating that is based on an assumption that housing prices will rise at 10%/year forever, just because they have for the last ten years.<p>Rating agencies aren't paid to be a cultural zeitgeist that analyzes and summarizes the way financial markets are <i>right now</i>.  They aren't paid to ""go with the flow"" and accept assumptions uncritically.  They are paid to predict what <i>will</i> happen in the future, and to make especially sure that the most confident ratings (which grannies depend on to make sure they don't lose their retirement) are only given to financial instruments that make the most conservative assumptions.<p>I'm just astounded that you so freely deflect blame for this onto the public.

Both cases require a significant outlay of resources and talent and I have respect for the work that went into each.<p>And this gets at a bunch of people, including yourself, claiming that HFT somehow defeats the ""purpose of the market(tm).""  But if I look this up on Wikipedia, I get the notion that it exists to help corporations raise money and secondarily to provide an indicator of the general economic mood.  I fail to see how HFT goes against this.  That said, I'd support everything Mark Cuban suggested short of the trading tax (because I believe (without proof) that it would have unintended negative consequences far beyond HFT).<p>Mark Cuban aside, I mostly see various people who, to quote an Amazon review of ""Broken Markets: How High Frequency Trading and Predatory Practices on Wall Street are Destroying Investor Confidence and Your Portfolio"", sound like the reviewer's grandparents explaining why they don't use computers.  No hard proof - just lots and lots of fear-mongering.<p>So much so that I'm starting to believe that the underlying issue here is resentment and jealousy that they didn't pull these hacks off themselves and walk away with the big bucks.<p>Finally, how is HFT worse than the ""good old days(tm)"" where major brokerages all had seats on trading room floors from which they could manipulate the bid/ask spread with impunity?  I'd counter that it's actually better now that <i>anyone</i> capable of getting the cash and talent upfront can get into the same game that's been played since the very beginning, except that the pace is continually accelerating and those left out in the cold are succumbing to future shock.

When I call read on a socket, the IO manager handles saving my context, doing the async read, yielding, and then restoring context and resuming when there's data to be read.<p>Doesn't this make it harder to reason about cases where multiple userland threads need to mutate the same state? You can't tell by inspection whether the function you're calling is going to yield somewhere deep inside.<p>With single threaded callback style you know your thread is the only thing that is executing and won't be interrupted. (Sure, other code can run between now and when your callback is invoked, but in practice I find that to be pretty easy to deal with.)",1360087982

Remember how popular it was to malign Java back in the late 90s?<p>And it's also true that the CLR really is technically superior to the JVM on a whole slew of points.  It has runtime-level support for generics (meaning C# lets you do all sorts of nice things with them that Java doesn't support).  It has user-defined value types. It supports coroutines (i.e., 'yield'). It supports anonymous functions and closures.  For those who just can't leave pointers alone, it even has unsafe blocks.  And so on.<p>So while it's definitely not ""proven"" in a sense that will impress your average PHB, in terms of technical merit I don't think there's really any comparison.

Blocking I/O operations using the Akka dispatcher will block that thread while the command executes. Doing this too often will cause all the akka threads to be blocked, stopping the dispatcher from processing more events. Therefore, one should avoid performing blocking operations on akka threads.<p>In my experience, one of two things will happen in practice:<p>1) You use an asynchronous library for I/O calls, which will maintain its own threadpool. This is no problem, because the I/O threadpool is independent from the akka theadpool.<p>2) You want to use a synchronous library that performs I/O operations using the caller's thread. If you must do this, you should use a separate threadpool (ExecutionContext).",1360087847

It took 1 week to figure out why all the crashing, and also to make Google Drive not conflict with some other stuff, hardlinking was required, and took more 3 days to undo the hardlinks.<p>Thus, lesson: DON'T, JUST DON'T.<p>But sometimes a person might nag you to do it, then by all means do it, it will fall on their head and they will learn (of course, if it is a intelligent person, if you have a dumb boss, then I fell sorry for you).",1360087539

This shows that you can do some consumer facing and software development around an outdated commodity platform and release it. That is nontrivial and the Ouya team certainly deserves credit for it, but it is not on the same level as what Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo do to produce their consoles. And it shows in the final product.<p><i>Also what makes you think that someone won't buy a console just to play one (really good) game?</i><p>I feel like you're wishcasting, which seems to be commonplace in Ouya discussions. What ""really good"" game is going to be a killer app for Ouya? The platform has very small reach and I can't see anyone with a truly promising title making it an Ouya exclusive.",1360087342

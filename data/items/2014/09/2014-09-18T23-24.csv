8338336,comment,8334442,8338224,1,0,decentrality,,,"Thanks a lot for your very detailed reply, especially digging into the semantics debate of you and Beard vs. Gardner.<p>Since I began this thread, after I invited Ries to weigh in, I wrote this on Medium to expand further on where Beard&#x27;s ideals lead me, as I think through The Lean Brand. I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you could weigh in on that also ( here or there is fine ) when you have another moment:<p><a href=""https://medium.com/@DonovanKeme/brand-as-relationship-vs-influence-376e8b6dce95"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@DonovanKeme/brand-as-relationship-vs-inf...</a><p>In the meantime, since you and Gardner both obviously spent a small eternity each on thinking through a definition or contemporary usage of the word Brand, it seems like that comes through most of all in your reply. As someone who appreciates etymology deeply, which I always keep in mind -- I&#x27;ll continue searching for a framework and language for Brand, thinking out loud about your definition, for you to respond on also. I feel very fortunate to have an author of one of the two books who seem to be vying for the term itself here!<p><a href=""http://etymonline.com/index.php?search=brand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etymonline.com/index.php?search=brand</a><p>Circa 1400, the word, used as a verb, included the meaning of &#x27;to stigmatize&#x27; and by 1600 included the meaning of &#x27;mark property&#x27; and &#x27;mark criminals&#x27; both as verbs; then as a noun, before the 1550&#x27;s its meaning included being a piece of burning word, then &#x27;mark made by hot iron&#x27; which expanded to &#x27;a particular make of goods&#x27; ( which coincides to what I read in The Lean Brand, taking about the Golden Spike in 1869, where Gardner claimed the current use of the word Brand is still at that point, which you seem to sustain? ). Only in 1992 did it include the meaning &quot;brand name&quot; which is itself a sustainer of the 1869 usage also.<p>My point is, words change dramatically in meaning, especially considering circa 1400 the verb usage was the exact opposite of what we mean now, like many other English words have done over time. So in searching for a language and framework as a standard, the existing definition, or the loudest shouted definition doesn&#x27;t necessarily answer what I need. If this were 1868 and we had never seen a train traveling across the continent, we wouldn&#x27;t even need the existing definitions you listed -- so as we stand at 2014 at the threshold of Alibaba vs. Amazon, and The United States Digital Services, plenty of totally free services such as this one, Hacker News and Twitter where you joined from, there is quite possibly an entirely different context for the word now.<p>I didn&#x27;t anticipate so much depth coming to my question so fast, otherwise I&#x27;d have mentioned that my personal situation as an innovator is the development of transmedia technologies, meaning that ( for perspective ) I come from a world where hackers in high school at the same time with me, are now 10 years later creating global organizations whose brands involve literal billions of individuals, and are valued at literal billions, whether created in their garage or in a skyscraper or bunker underground. There is another context for the word brand now, and if one or a few people began from the premise of influence as Beard seems to say, and as you seem to sustain, there would be a problem I feel, in my approach to the question: why would I need to persuade the entire world of something? Why would I want to? Wouldn&#x27;t I want to work within a sub-set of that world, and invite that sub-set into my offering? I cannot and would not want to scale to the size of accommodating the planet, unless my brand itself is to provide something intangible or automatic. Even then, the relationship rather than the influence would be my focus, because as we see over and over with the Google complaints and a litany of others regarding privacy, influence is the exact thing being purged from the groundswell definition and usage of Brand. For me, until I read The Lean Brand, the word Brand was heading back to &#x27;to stigmatize&#x27; in my feelings about it.<p>So with all that said, I am very curious to hear your reply to my musing on Medium linked above.<p>And from what I gather, Gardner is out of the country, and from what I&#x27;ve heard, his book is being released October 8th, so he probably will be hard to get, but Brant Cooper seems to be in the United States and might be available. I hope one or both of them can come address your thoughts and mine. Like Beard and Wilkins said, this is an extremely important topic, and I am so glad for your time.",1411084713

8338310,comment,8335010,8338070,3,0,pacala,,,"Great comment, provides good food for thought.<p>The core FP idea <i>is</i> to focus on immutable data and data transformations. This <i>is</i> the minimal set of concepts one needs to juggle to get computations going. When modules communicate, they need to pass data and identify the transformations, so there is no dichotomy here between FP and OO (!). Especially if you think of method tables as data.<p>The String / Data.Text split in Haskell is an artefact of Haskell&#x27;s ecosystem. It is not a conceptual hurdle, but rather an implementation detail. It is not too hard to imagine a different FP ecosystem where one can readily substitute different implementations under the same immutable data structure API, all with very explicit parametrization of the data transformations. All of (1)immutability, (2)simple data API, (3)polymorphism and (4)explicitism are important. Note that OO systems encourage (3), while FP systems encourage (1), (2) and (4).<p>Code as if you have immutable data and apply data transformations, tune performance by using the best implementations under the common simple data API. The question becomes how to build a system where all of them are ergonomic to use. IMHO, Haskell is not quite it, rather places like Dart / C# offer better ergonomics.<p>The other example is also thought provoking. In a system with polymorphism support, it&#x27;s relatively straightforward to supply one&#x27;s favorite String implementation, including one that prints a log on every String construction. The question is how to provide the new module to clients, which is reminiscent of dependency injection, but concrete implementations of DI are magic bad. In an explicit style, this would be realized by making modules functors of other modules and explicitly passing in the method tables:<p><pre><code>  function Foobar(string) \n    return {\n      foo: function(x) \n        return string.concat(x, string.new(&#x27;abc&#x27;)) \n      end\n    }\n  end\n\n  function main1()\n    string = String()\n    foobar = Foobar(string)\n    foobar.foo(string.new(&#x27;xyz&#x27;))\n  end\n\n  function LoggingString()\n    return String() + {\n      new: function(x)\n        print(x)\n        return String.new(x)\n      end\n    }\n  end\n\n  function main2()\n    string = LoggingString()\n    foobar = Foobar(string)\n    foobar.foo(string.new(&#x27;xyz&#x27;))\n  end\n</code></pre>\nBut it takes discipline to write the above and not sprinkle the code with String().new(...) everywhere, which defeats the purpose.",1411084005

I know I did. The sample code did silly things like sort integers. Everything was simple, trivial, academic. Where&#x27;s the real code? I would wonder. I&#x27;d read three books and we&#x27;d never get around to building a system.<p>Looking back, what I missed was that I was already looking at the real code.

This is obviously an interface, we should always use SOLID, and on and on and on and on. I had a feel for what good OO looks like. It&#x27;s a beautiful, rich thing. Love it.<p>But this kind of thinking not only was not useful in solving FP problems, <i>it consistently led me down the wrong path in structuring FP solutions</i>, which was weird.

8338298,comment,8337499,8338219,2,0,rotw,,,"I read somewhere (forgotten the book title sorry, I&#x27;ll try and get back to you on that!) that our patriarchal society&#x27;s gender roles (and thus the games children play at a young age to educate them about these) differ for men and women in terms of how they relate to people: For men, competition is emphasised, meaning that <i>independence</i> and <i>dominance</i> is the prime goal, while for women, <i>connection</i> and <i>bonding</i> is the overarching ideal.<p>To this end, having stereotypes and games like girls playing with dolls while boys build things and play more combative games instills different behaviours in children, which fundamentally change how they relate to others. You can still see it reflected in stupid things like &quot;Be a man&quot;, which is essentially a shaming shorthand for &quot;assert independence and dominance, thus showing less vulnerability to those able to dominate you in a competitive social hierarchy&quot;.<p>This obviously also reflects on the way people relate to obedience; independence being a supposed virtue, obedience can be intepreted from this masculine framework as an attempt by someone else to dominate. Emphasising co-operation and connection, though, means a greater willingness to engage. These are obviously only broad trends, but they are noticeable.",1411083757

The core business could be worth $8 a share and its cash and Yahoo! Japan stake could be worth another $8 a share (assuming a full tax bite on the sale of Yahoo Japan). The 140 million shares of Alibaba to be sold in the IPO should net after taxes around $6 billion, or $6 a share. That totals about $22 a share.<p>> So, Yahoo&#x27;s share price direction probably hinges on the value of the remaining Alibaba stake—based on the Alibaba share price—and the tax treatment of the likely sale or disposition of that stock.<p>> Bulls argue that Yahoo&#x27;s shares could trade into the $50 range if Alibaba appreciates sharply after the IPO and Yahoo can find a way to get its remaining stake to holders in a tax-efficient way. This also suggests that Yahoo shares could find support around current levels given the value of that Alibaba stake.",1411083756

8338224,comment,8334442,8334442,1,0,laurabusche,,,"Thanks for opening this fascinating discussion @decentrality. Sean&#x27;s structure (which has clearly emerged from practice) coincides with the Lean Branding book&#x27;s perspective on brand building, measurement and learning.<p>I wanted to share how my perspective weighs in on the &quot;semantics debate&quot;, and it is a product of both my academic and consulting experiences. I studied business (undergraduate), design management (graduate) and psychology (doctoral) to arrive at an integral definition of brand that would incorporate both business objectives (which in the startup world often translate to traction and conversion) and consumer psychology. After looking at these definitions theoretically, I began doing consulting work for politicians, government institutions, and companies of all sizes in South America. In particular, I led a Lean Branding program for 303 entrepreneurs (97 tech startups) over the last 3 years to arrive at a framework that would effectively help practitioners &quot;that need this muddy water cleared to be able to aggregate their values&quot;(like you pointed out). After all, it is a matter of pragmatism: we need to understand this in order to capitalize on it. That&#x27;s exactly why I wrote this book.<p>These experiences shaped my definition of brand, which is described in the book as &quot;the unique story that consumers recall when they think of you. This story associates your product with their personal stories, a particular personality, what you promise to solve, and with your position in relation to competitors. Your brand is represented by your visual symbols, and feeds from multiple conversations where you must participate strategically.&quot;<p>There are four key aspects to the definition that the Lean Branding book proposes:<p>- It embraces consumer co-creation: your brand does not exist in isolation. It is shaped by consumer perception.\n- It is story-centered: consumers recall your brand as an holistic story- the sum of both experiences AND symbols. (Coinciding with Sean here)\n- It highlights empathy: consumers look for your brand because of what it can do for them (how your value story connects with THEIR personal stories).\n- It allows for iteration (a dynamic brand): the brand feeds from multiple, ongoing conversations (about its value).<p>The most commonly known definition of brand comes from the American Marketing Association: &quot;A brand is a name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller&#x27;s good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.&quot; As you&#x27;ve probably noticed, it is focused on identity and assets.<p>The Lean Branding book&#x27;s definition is closest to Seth Godin&#x27;s, which is: &quot;A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another. If the consumer (whether it’s a business, a buyer, a voter or a donor) doesn’t pay a premium, make a selection or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions via Twitter (@laurabusche, @leanbranding) or email laura@laurabusche.com<p>Lean Branding is out now (Amazon, Barnes and Noble & O&#x27;Reilly) and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts.<p>Thanks for opening this thread.<p>My very best,<p>LB",1411082572

You can see it all the time in OCaml: a module signature will declare an opaque, possibly parametric, type, as well as a set of operators over that type.  <i>The internal structure of that type is never exposed.</i>  All creation and use, and ideally comparisons (though it is unfortunately not enforced in OCaml) must go through the module&#x27;s API.<p>(Module signatures, it should be noted, may be shared by multiple implementations, permitting compile-time dispatch.)<p>Yet while maintaining opacity, I am free to dispense with the excess baggage an OO class entails: run-time dispatch; a single &quot;self&quot; (i.e. the &quot;friend&quot; problem); that abomination known as inheritance; all these things I need no longer worry about, and my code can be cleaner and more efficient.",1411082217

Had I known back then that I would have been better off doing an internet startup and then later do a fusion startup with the petty cash fund, I would obviously have chosen that route.  But like most founders, I thought I could actually succeed, or why else try?<p>The real issue with incentivizing long-term investment is one of distributing risk and reward over both participants and time.  The great advantage of the web startup space is the quick time to expand the market - even if working fusion were here today, it would not have the growth curve typical of successful web companies.  Add this to the long and risky development time for things like fusion (or AI, or space launchers, etc.), and what you say seems obvious.<p>So, why did I choose to follow the risky route rather than the more assured Big R&D route?  Well, competition is the main answer.  Big R&D projects often start with the idea that developing something is expensive, and since you can&#x27;t afford to build more than one, this idea morphs into the One True Design (e.g. ITER/Tokomak in fusion). Then big R&D turns its back on other, possibly cheaper development paths.  Taking the VC route may put the risk on to the participants, but at least it is open to new, cheap ideas which may be able to bypass the big R&D route.",1411081956

Today, we have an infrastructure similar to what Certificate Transparency is said to produce -- without collusion or support from the CAs. Bitcoin and other blockchain based technologies have an economic incentive to continue to propagate. I fail to see why anyone other than the CA&#x27;s would have an incentive for the Certificate Transparency blockchain to propagate.<p>I proposed an alternative model which i called &#x27;UTXOC&#x27;. I wrote a paper and published some python scripts to generate certificates based on a prior bitcoin transaction.\nA certificate validity can be determined by some bitcoin-like value left unspent. If the value is spent, the cert if invalid.\nIf the private key is compromised, the attacker has an economic advantage in &#x27;cashing out&#x27; the value; thus invalidating the certificate.\nI propose that also adds to the cost of key substitution attacks on TLS; an active MiTM would need to spend at least as much cryptocurrency in order to successfully fake a certificate, even with a trusted root in the client.<p>It could go either way -- with CA support for such things, or a self-signed &#x27;cryptocurrency bond&#x27; style model where TLS operators hold cryptocurrency in order to maintain the validity of their certs.<p>This is published here: \n<a href=""https://github.com/MiWCryptoCurrency/UTXOC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MiWCryptoCurrency/UTXOC</a><p>Very interested to hear opinions on this, its a work in progress.

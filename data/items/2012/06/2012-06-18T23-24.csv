I gave two examples of the kind of art people here appreciate perfectly well.

What I do have is have some notion of why people appreciate it.<p>I at no point said, ""Gosh, you can understand all art easily after 3 sentences of explanation"". Which you should have gotten by analogy; a layman can't get one of the IOCCC entries after a short explanation, and a non-gamer won't really appreciate Upgrade Complete if it's the first game they've ever played.

4129277,comment,4128497,4128869,2,0,jshen,,,"You highlight one of my greatest frustrations with android. I have an android phone, droid x2, that is about a year old. I can't get 4.0 on it!<p>""I guess I just fail to see how ""it's more intuitive"" is anything more than ""I'm used to it"" these days.""<p>If a 2 year old can use iOS easily, and not use Android, then it is much more than ""I'm used to it"". Right? Regardless of whether I am a two year old, that is strong evidence that it is more intuitive.<p>""Even multitasking is more intuitive in Android.""<p>Not on my droid x2. I have no idea wtf it's doing. When I hold down the home button it shows me about 5 apps. It thinks it is showing me the most recently used, but I have no idea how it determines that. It usually shows me the ""Home"" ""app"" which apparently gets used often. All this ""app"" does is take me to the home screen. The next app it always shows me is the google currents app. Apparently every time it fetches more content in the background it counts that as ""recently used"".<p>I can go on and on and on like this.<p>""I mean this in a humorous sense, but are you a 2 year old? And even then, what user experiences vary so much across them that there's a discernable difference?""<p>Tons, but I don't feel like taking the time to type them out. I'll give you two quick examples. I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old. The 4 year old had an iPad when she was 2 as well so I've watched two kids use iPads and one of them use android. They learn by pushing buttons/icons and remembering what happens. My android phone is sleeping, how do they wake it up? There are 4 buttons instead of 1, that confuses a two year old for a while. eventually they can remember which one is which, but it takes a while. So that's one thing. Now once they get the screen on and they want to unlock it, there are two sliders instead of 1. The second slider turns the sound off and on. That's the second thing. Ok, I'll add one more, widgets. When you look at an iOS screen there are only icons for apps or folders so all you can really do are open apps or open folders which shows you apps. On android you don't know what you're looking at or what will happen when you click it. Maybe it will call the person in the picture, maybe it's a text box to enter a search, maybe it doesn't do anything and is just some informational widget, and maybe it's an app and will open an app. There's another.<p>Ok, one more. Many apps, even ones for kids, depend on the back button. This confuses the hell out of a 2 year old, yet my two year old has no problem figuring out how to navigate around the coloring apps on iOS which have buttons in the app for navigation.",1340063679

You can view it using the 'netstat' command on Windows and Linux.<p>Bittorrent tends to create several entries in the state-table (since you're typically connected to hundred of seeds/leeches), which are each stored in memory, and uses up CPU resources to setup/maintain/teardown.<p>So if you were downloading a file via, say, Rapidshare, there'd be probably 1 TCP (you can configure your browser to use more) connection for your router to track, and do the necessary TCP handshakes, acknowledgments, RWIN scaling etc. Multiply all that's necessary for 1 TCP connection by N, where N is the number of peers you're connected to, and the limited resources on a $60 router get used up fast.<p>Early models of the now-famous Linksys WRT54G could reliably be crashed by torrenting while using stock firmware. A power-cycle was necessary to get it running again. Fun times.<p>However, all this only applies if you're running the router in NAT mode, which means the router takes the IP address from your ISP, and acts as the endpoint on behalf of your computer. If the router is running in bridged mode, then your computer acts as the endpoint, as much more equipped to handle large numbers of TCP connections.<p>Edit: Formatting, Grammar.",1340062792

My main concern is securing my right and profits in the startups. I would like to partly cash-out on some investments after several months without waiting 3-5 years. One way to secure my interests is to insist to generate new shares in a startup for following investors by share splitting. This way I can secure my % share for some time but the fact is that probably most founders will not accept that way. The standard thing is issuing new shares with existing shareholders dilution.

Sorry to ask more questions but you're offering a truly valuable and different perspective to other feedback.
I'm curious to hear more on your view that you wouldn't use it for assets and you don't think most designers would.<p>Interestingly some other designers have said that they're looking for 'building blocks' or components to save time in the design process. Do you feel that's an exception rather than the rule and therefore you design absolutely everything from scratch without borrowing inspiration or gathering assets to speed things up? This is really what I'm interested in knowing more about as it's really this insight that to speed up design downloaded assets that are still in layered art format (i.e. a PSD) can help to speed things up?

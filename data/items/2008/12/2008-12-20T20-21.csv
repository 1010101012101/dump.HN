404811,comment,404581,404790,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>The ""S&P 500"" is not the same as the ""investment industry""</i><p>It's a big part of it, and the rest of the industry was operating in much the same way.<p><i>Buying an asset with the expectation that it will increase in value...</i><p>People expected the asset to increase in price.  The only way an asset can increase in price is if new buyers are willing to pay more money for it.   If this increase in price corresponded to an increase in the underlying cashflow, that would be healthy.  But the price of stocks  were increasing at a far greater rate than dividends were increasing.  Therefore it was not healthy at all.<p>Another way of putting it: if you bought a share a S&P 500 ETF, and knew you could never, ever sell it, what kind of dividend yield would you demand?  I would demand at least a 5% dividend, maybe more.  By that metric, the S&P in 2007 was overpriced by about 70%.  That premium is based on the idea that someone else would be willing to pay that price or more.<p>The S&P is not really a ponzi scheme.  When a ponzi scheme is big enough, and it is legal, we have a new name for it: money.  S&P stocks were essentially trading as private currencies.  See my longer comment on this here: <a href=""http://www.newmogul.com/item?id=2587"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newmogul.com/item?id=2587</a><p><i>It is important for everyone to understand that Krugman is the worst kind of shill.</i><p>He is a shill, but it's important to criticize him for the right reasons.  The elephant that Krugman misses is that from 1995-2008 the dollar was diluting at ~10% a year.  When that happens, holding any asset other than the dollar - stocks, real estate, gold, oil - starts looking like a great idea.",1229806615

Buying an asset with the expectation that it will increase in value is not the same thing as a direct system of payments between clients with no underlying assets. You're not really addressing my comment or Krugman's article.<p>But that's not the point. The point is that Krugman's objects of comparison share almost no correspondence. Even Lehman Brothers was substantially profitable when brought down by one class of securities, the creation of which was largely a government affair.

404789,comment,404707,404707,0,0,bigboote,,,"James cites the law as a good example of drawing fine lines around difficult issues, citing the definition for amounts of LSD. If you don't know about this, 500 micrograms of LSD is a dose, but you can't see anything that small so it's normally distributed on a chunk of blotter paper weighing 1000x as much. So when the law says that possessing X amount of LSD is a felony, does that include the blotter paper? The courts have said it does. Is this a triumph of the law drawing fine lines around difficult issues, or were lawmakers just ignorant of basic measurement techniques, prosecutors greedy, and judges easily fooled?<p>An example consequence of this interpretation: having 0.5 oz of pot is a minor crime. But if you mix it with 10 lb of lawn trimmings, you now have 10+ lbs of material with a detectable amount of a controlled substance, and you're theoretically guilty of a major crime. This is not a law written by science majors.<p>Giving credit to the legal system for sorting out such a broken law is like giving credit to Vista for having a stylishly designed BSOD.",1229805117

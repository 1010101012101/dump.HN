He hates the minimize-to-dock effect in OSX, saying it ""wastes time"". I just hit the minimize button and it took all of <i>one second</i> - one second in which my hindbrain was given a strong visual cue that <i>I am switching out of one context</i>. I use it regularly and I've never stopped to think about it.<p>I mean, a lot of the stuff he's saying feels ""condescending""? It's all stuff that has preferences. You can change the size of icons. I mostly navigate my Mac's filesystem in the 3-column view.<p>He's bemoaning the fact that the OSX menu fades out when you leave it versus the System 3ish menus that just popped in and out. And honestly I can't say I notice the fade consciously either - but subconsciously I <i>like</i> it. It's instantly responsive when I ask for it, and it's got a nice slow visual effect as I'm done with it.<p>But then again, for all that I'm an artist with a bent towards minimalism, the OSX address book really doesn't bug me either. I quit using the iPad's calendar - but that's because it had a design directly taken from the revised OSX one, with that unusable-on-tablets row of tiny buttons for changing weeks. I really don't <i>see</i> supposed horrid UI sins like Calendar's torn page, it's just chrome that's vanished into the background.<p>He basically seems to be saying that all modern polish is crap and we should be happy with the looks that were pretty much required back in the 90s due to limitations. He disses new experiments like Metro as well, but really doesn't manage to articulate what his dream UI would be. Besides ""oh god I wish I could use BeOS"".

In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

For example, I can watch videos in the Facebook app, but not Facebook home (a little strange). Similarly, you can't share webpages, etc. His whole thesis was that it took over too much of the phone while simultaneously not providing enough Facebook features.

To see facts without opinion is one thing, but to have opinions about facts is totally another. It is one thing just to see the fact that a whole people are caught in superstition, but quite another to see that fact and condemn it. Opinions are not important, because I will have one opinion, you will have another, and a third person will have still another. To be concerned with opinions is a stupid form of thinking. What is important is to see facts as they are without opinion, without judging, without comparing.<p>To feel beauty without opinion is the only real perception of beauty. Similarly, if you can see the people of India just as they are, see them very clearly without fixed opinions, without judging, then what you see will be real.<p>The Indians have certain manners, certain customs of their own, but fundamentally they are like any other people. They get bored, they are cruel, they are afraid, they revolt within the prison of society, just as people do everywhere else. Like the Americans, they also want comfort, only at present they do not have it to the same extent. They have a heavy tradition about renouncing the world and trying to be saintly; but they also have deep-rooted ambitions, hypocrisy, greed, envy, and they are broken up by castes, as human beings are everywhere else, only here it is much more brutal. Here in India you can see more closely the whole phenomenon of what is happening in the world. We want to be loved, but we don't know what love is; we are unhappy, thirsting for something real, and we turn to books, to the Upanishads, the Gita, or the Bible, so we get lost in words, in speculations.

If I did, I'd be in the next class of the local incubator. Not looking to work 60+ hours a week for next few years. I need the flexibility to work remote.

We'll probably fail the first few times, but we'll get an idea off the ground eventually, and make money. I imagine several sites/apps at a time would be required to make good money. Me: front-end developer (backbone.js, knockout.js, etc.) with back-end experience, with a couple different python back-end frameworks. (django / propriety back-end) 
I work my ass off, and I am dead set on making this happen. I'll do whatever has to be done to make this goal a reality. The goal is to make $500 a month within 3 months of working together, within 1 year to make our full salaries! This is possible  only with hard-work, dedication, and being crafty. I can't do it alone, I need help: back-end, design, and maybe a good marketing guy/gal. We'll have to work our asses off at first, but the goal is ratchet it down, and only maintain, build enhancements, bug fixes, and make money.

You either charge batteries or you dump the power into a load like an electric water heater.<p>In almost all grid-tied scenarios though, you want to sell the power back to the utility. I'm not familiar with commerical operations, as they would fall under power purchase agreements (PPAs), but with residential installations your meter quite literally does spin backwards or a separate meter is used to determine how much power you've sent back to the grid. This is dependent on how the utility compensates you for the power you generate (spin the meter back if its a credit or the same price as what your purchase it from them at, separate meter if the pricing paid to you is different than the retail rate).<p>As the article states, we don't have the issues in the US that Germany has yet, because Germany produces so much more solar energy than in the US. At some point though, questions will need to be answered about who is going to pay for the spinning capacity (likely natural gas generators) that isn't used except for those rare times when the wind isn't blowing, the sun isn't shinning, and you can't drag enough power in from another geographic region over HVDC transmission lines.",1365884369

This increases the wages of workers in Trade B in Florida-America by 200% due to the shortage of Product H. The net-gain here is Zero for The United States of America (assuming workers in Trade B and X are same in numbers, thereby cancelling each other's net loss/gains out).<p>Ought not the American government allow the immigrants on the basis that, overall, it is increasing the wealth of the world economy; the world of which the United States of America is very much a part of?<p>I suppose the argument can be made that fundamentally the government only cares about its own Prosperity even in this case, and that a ""rising tide lifts all boats"" scenario outlined above merely falls into that category.",1365884368

In fact, being born into the middle class is a privilege, and there is a vast range of privilege within the middle class.

There's high unemployment. The government encourages people to hire domestic workers. Checking now the rates are about US$ 1/hour. These are maids/domestics, gardeners, childminders, caretakers for the sick and elderly, and so on.<p>I grew up on the US, and from my family learned a strong moral principle that it's best to do everything yourself, rather than have 'people cater to my every need' at home. As an adult, I followed that same moral principle.<p>Then I bought a house. With a garden. A quite beautiful garden that I wanted to keep. I couldn't do it myself. More importantly, my rates as a software developer were more than 8x that of a gardener. I fought that moral training and realized that it's little different than regularly going to a mechanic to maintain my car.<p>The position of the South African government is similar. If you have the money, then why not use it to hire people to help around the house? Living in South Africa for a short time, I learned about some of the advantages of having someone who would do laundry, including ironing, sweeping, or mowing the lawn. None are tasks I enjoy.<p>As you (and the essayist) point out, that's fraught with difficulties. At what point does that turn into a sense of entitlement? How can abuses in the workplace (that is, the home) be monitored and reduced?<p>You can read some of the difficulties and different viewpoints at <a href=""http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/473.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/473.1</a> .",1365883209

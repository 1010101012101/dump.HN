RBCC is not a catchall. This is a refinement of the Liquid Air Cycle Engine concept that was researched by the US military in the 60's and the british in the 80's. The principal british investigator was Alan Bond, who is also the principal in Reaction.<p>It is appropriate to distinguish it from both jet engines and rocket engines because in the Brayton Cycle compression is adiabatic rather than diabatic in SABRE.

4845527,comment,4844417,4845489,2,0,_delirium,,,"Sure, some of those are outliers, but they're merely the <i>most</i> outrageous outliers from already quite right-wing ""mainstream conservative"" positions. I've been observing Republicans fairly closely for a while, because I first started voting in a rather GOP-heavy district of Texas (southeast Houston), so in some cases voting in the GOP primary was the only way to have any impact at all, by voting for the more-moderate candidate. And the people I've seen are, by and large, shockingly unacceptable. When I was in high school (late 1990s), they opposed repealing Texas's anti-sodomy laws, which made it a <i>criminal offense</i> to engage in ""immoral"" sex. We're not talking about same-sex marriage here, but about actually being arrested for having sex in one's own house. When that law was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2003, the state GOP was outraged, and put into its platform a condemnation of ""activist judges"" and the ""homosexual agenda"", and a demand that homosexuality be somehow re-criminalized. Not just a few fringe representatives: that was the consensus position of the statewide party. That specific demand was finally voted out of the platform just this year, in 2012, though my own local congressman (TX-36) still speaks darkly of ""homosexuals"" more often than you might think necessary, along with ""anchor babies"" for good measure. I don't see how I could possibly find that kind of rhetoric appealing.<p>As far as rape goes, what was sort of surprising is that Akin <i>wasn't</i> even the only outlier among Senate candidates in this election alone in having a ""rape-comment scandal"": Mourdock in IN also somehow found it necessary to mention that pregnancy from rape is a ""gift from God"".",1354146909

I'd hope it's not too controversial to posit that (a) most university humanities cultures are more similar to Harvard than West Point, and (b) it is obvious that Harvard's math dept. teaches objective truth, and not so much for Harvard's history dept.<p>Many, perhaps most students care primarily about a job and won't read history on their own time. So in order to get a job they get that technical degree, and receive the humanities content alongside. They never feel the urge to uninstall that humanities content, or to check it against Google Books primary sources. It's just the default.<p>The default today is heavier on the Nazis than the Gulag, as one example, and this difference in emphasis has many downstream effects. Weimar is less likely to be studied than dependencia theory, for another example.<p>With MOOCs, this package deal of tech + humanities is going to end soon.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that English is a Scandinavian language proper, but it was very easy to learn growing up.<p>Even as a kid growing up in Denmark, with all the British/American shows on TV (not dubbed) it was easy to learn a lot just by reading subtitles and following along. I give Saturday morning cartoon re-runs a lot of credit for helping me to learn. I remember sitting on a train with a friend of mine and us both realizing that we both knew a lot of English a year before we were going to start learning it in school.<p>I've found that most Scandinavians (or at least Danes) have a pretty easy time with English. Because the sentence structures are so similar, you're mostly plugging in English words that you're already familiar with and using the same sentence.<p>That said, on a deeper level, English is a very different language. That's most likely because it is such a cross between other languages.",1354145341

The idea is that original SOV speakers of saxon were put under the heavy influence of the SVO languages of the danes and later (post 1066 - battle of hastings) that of the SVO normans. It would make sense, especially since even OE was not a truly pure SOV language and allowed a much freer word order due to the inflection system, which upon dying out forced word order to take on a much stricter form.<p>As an interesting side note to show just how big of a hack mixed up jumble of everything modern english is, the usage of the verb do, in elliptical sentences and questions such as ""do you want some coffee?"", is very rare in indo-european languages (only found in celtic langs such as irish) and thought to have been picked up during the time in which saxon speakers and celts were sharing the same island.",1354144280

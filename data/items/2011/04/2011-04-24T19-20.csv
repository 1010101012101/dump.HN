2479454,comment,2479287,2479423,12,0,mattmanser,,,"I used to work for one of these business and it's nowhere near as nefarious as you make out. In their case at least it happened accidentally and gradually.<p>For example the product starts out simple but grows in complexity, so suddenly you notice the 1 hour install that your consultant used to start his usually 4 day client customisation work with has turned into a whole day and you're now charging for 5 days of consultant time. This leads to the perverse economics that writing an installer, which costs you money in dev time and impacts the development schedule, will actually lose you money. So the installer never reaches the top of the priority stack until it's a real pita as you can recoup the costs compared to the lost opportunity of not working on a new client module.<p>Also it's the client themselves that demand the extensibility of software. It's almost impossible to perfectly model someone's unique workflow in any non-trivial system.<p>Say a client has a risk rating they give every new project. Obviously they want to be able to record that rating in their project management software. And then they want particular directors emailed when that project is moved from tender to won. And then they also want accounts notified. And then they want a team auto-assigned. And then, and then, and then.<p>Enterprise software has to be flexible and extensible for many businesses. Because virtually every business is different.<p>We may mock it, but getting it right is very, very difficult. And many of these businesses end up with consultants just to manage extensibility and tailoring because getting it wrong severely impacts the usefulness, and thus ROI, of the new software.<p>I don't think there's any greed motivation as you seem to paint it, I think a lot of enterprise software started with a good, simple product and then gradually got forced into complexity by client sales requirements, big support contract clients and over promising in sales (quite often by accident).<p>The directors of the company I worked for were proud of their product and genuinely wanted to deliver value to their customers. They did, growing amounts of consultant time was not caused by greed but because every client ran their company differently and so wanted their software to be slightly different. Maybe the 37signals type approach is better, but don't mistake it for a nefarious desire to constantly grow the billable hours.",1303673866

2479444,comment,2479053,2479262,2,0,Mz,,,"<i>Actually, food is the only problem when it comes to whether or not a population is sustainable. Enery and resource usage determine if a particular lifestyle is sustainable for a given population.</i><p>Food needs aren't static:  They vary considerably from person to person and can be changed for a particular individual who sets out to change their lifestyle.  Also, a lot of the energy that is currently being expended for transportation could be readily replaced by human energy if walking and biking became more popular -- which is both an energy issue and a lifestyle issue.<p>I currently live without a car and I have a medical condition that typically causes one to have a very high calorie need.  I've worked hard on getting myself healthier and my calorie need has shrunk dramatically.  In some ways it is counterintuitive, but living without a car has turned out to be an asset in that regard.  Doing a lot of walking is one of the things that has helped me get healthier and shrink my calorie needs.  Obesity is epidemic in the US and we do not have a very pedestrian-friendly environment.  Most Americans seem unable to imagine living without a car.<p>So this assumption that energy and some kind of non-food fuel are separate from food and people just doesn't quite compute for me.  They aren't totally separate issues.  If people walked more and drove less, it would leave more gasoline and other fuel sources for other things and, at least in America, likely substantially lower food needs as well.",1303673429

It presents exactly the attitude and frame of mind that I've developed over the last year with my service business.<p>A year ago, I was getting impatient. I wanted to find some funding so that we could more quickly develop the products that we were ready to develop. What I found instead is that businesses like mine are the bastard children among entrepreneurs: it doesn't scale, it probably won't make millions <i>next year</i>, it's not sexy, nobody cares.<p>So, then I decided that the next best thing would be to talk to a bunch of business advisers, and see if there was a way to ramp the business up more quickly. All of them save <i>one</i> failed to ""get"" what the business was about, and gave us advice that amounted to, ""don't do what you're doing, do it the way everybody else does instead.""<p>I went through a short period of disenchantment and self-doubt, until I started looking at where the business had started and how far it had already come in just a couple of years. I took a second look at things like advertising and realized that, despite throwing a lot of money into marketing and the like, word-of-mouth had continued to be the number one source of new customers by far. So, the advertising and marketing budget got slashed to close to zero, and we doubled-down on what we were good at: taking care of our customers. I picked up another person who brought some more really great talent with him, and things are pretty great all 'round now.<p>I'm OK with slow growth now, and not getting a piece of the sexy SV action. I think we're growing like a freight train: r-e-a-l-l-y slow to start, but almost unstoppable once we get going.<p>In a few years, maybe I'll be able to do some seed stage funding of my own. That would be fun, and I'd love to focus on the people that so many others are ignoring: those that are passionate about their business, and want to reach as many customers as possible, without giving up all of the qualities that makes them unique.",1303673209

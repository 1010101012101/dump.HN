The AT is physically more difficult than the PCT.  Both are long distance hikes where, once initial physical issue have been conquered, become more of a mental challenge than physical challenge.<p>The PCT seems to be more hostile to feet than the AT.  Lots of hikers have a difficult time figuring out the right combination of miles, shoes, socks, and so on during the Southern California part of the PCT.  Blisters are very common.  The AT&#x27;s ups and downs can be more hazardous to ankles and knees.  Hiking poles are common and useful on both.<p>Resupply options on the PCT are less frequent than the AT leading to longer sections between resupply than on the AT. There are only three or four shelters on the PCT so camping locations must be thought out in advance (i.e. consulting maps to identify level ground) or discovered en-route.  You have to be prepared to dry-camp as stopping for the day at the last water source will cut into your daily miles too much.<p>Weather can be challenging on either trail but the &#x27;season&#x27; for hiking is much longer on the AT than the PCT.

Most companies don&#x27;t want the hassle. It is not only taxes, but for example a US company is open a really expecting a fast turn around time from a country that has a national holiday.<p>Plus it takes substantially more time to find qualified people on the other side of the world. Many of the remote workers I know used to work at headquarters for a couple years and THEN moved. It much less risk.",1430449834

Do you really believe no indie artist has ever collected royalties on their music?<p>Yes, I do understand how licensing works. The RIAA collects royalties on all music, whether or not the artist is signed to one of their labels[0].<p>Then, the artist has to register with the RIAA (technically, SoundExchange) to get paid, and if the RIAA is in a good mood, they may decide to pay the artist. Or they may decide to keep some or all of the money they collected on behalf of the artist[1].<p>Again, this applies not just to artists who are signed to a major label, but to independent artists who have <i>no association with the RIAA whatsoever</i>.<p>Meanwhile, the RIAA files lawsuits on the grounds that the artists (read: the RIAA) is losing money due to filesharing, and when they receive a settlement, they pay literally <i>none</i> of that money to the artists they claimed were harmed, and instead spend that money on... more lawsuits[2].<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/04/24/327063/-Is-the-RIAA-Pulling-a-Scam-on-the-Music-Industry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/04/24/327063/-Is-the-RIAA...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2014/05/08/soundexchange-screwing-me-out-of-money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2014/05/08/soundex...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2008/03/17/riaa-pockets-filesharing-settlement-money-doesnt-pay-artists-whose-copyrights-were-infringed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consumerist.com/2008/03/17/riaa-pockets-filesharing-s...</a>",1430449799

You could have:<p><pre><code>    response <- findTopic &quot;tide-pods&quot; [(Gender, Male)] config

Maybe make the common operations available in a strongly typed api, but allow users to use strings like this as a fallback. Then you can better guarantee &quot;correct if it compiles&quot;.",1430449653

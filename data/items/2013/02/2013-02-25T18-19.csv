5280897,comment,5278133,5280207,5,0,caxap,,,"At the moment, I am writing some computer vision code in VHDL. A part of the circuit will perform connected component labeling (CCL) on incoming images, because I want to extract some features from some object in the images. And CCL is actually a union find algorithm. The algorithm can be written in a normal programming language like Racket or even Java in a couple of hours. However, the same algorithm will take me weeks to work out and test in VHDL!
I have done some nontrivial work with FPGAs, and every single time it was hard, because every low-level detail has to be considered.
Maybe it is so hard because on FPGAs you are forced to optimize right from the start, whereas when using programming languages, you can develop a prototype quickly and then improve upon it?
How is your experience with developing stuff on FPGAs?",1361818773

5280886,comment,5277085,5277085,1,0,evebrow,,,"There are people with celiac, and then there are those with wheat allergy, gluten intolerance, and gluten sensitivity. The celiac people do everyone else a disservice by making light of anyone in the other categories. My mom, myself, and 2 daughters all have tested positive for gluten antibodies, after dealing with Hashimotos, Parkinsons, Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, chronic sinusitis, and bipolar in our family. Friends with diabetes, osteoporosis, gall bladder problems,  and out of control children have tested positive for gluten antibodies, with a range of different doctors and tests. None of us have had an invasive, risky, expensive biopsy, which is the only way to ""prove"" celiac, but going gluten-free has changed us all for the better, and cured the easier sicknesses including the bipolar. This is a silent and much more widely reaching epidemic than most people realize, and causes serious health problems, which drive our collective healthcare costs up. No one needs bread to survive, more people should see if gluten ails them, too. Celiac is just the tip of the iceberg, subclinical gluten intolerance affects up to 30% of Americans. I could quote dozens of legitimate research studies that back this up, having researched this issue over the past 5 years. Learn the facts - this is not quackery. Thank you New York Times!

Bingo. I think that for programming languages where clarity is already a common virtue (think, Ruby, Python, Clojure) -- folks already need to be writing clearly when they program: making the code clear to read, naming variables and functions very well, doing logical ordering of sections of code etc. That's already about halfway towards what you would do if you were accompanying the code with a bit of essay.

This might not necessarily be a good mental state since it diverges one's attention depending on the current social context one is in.

I don't know any parent that _want_ their kids eating junk, but fresh fruit and vegetables are actually quite expensive and far more difficult to keep than your average junk snack.  That's the hard part: justifying the higher cost and spoilage when you're just barely making the bills.<p>Most of my childhood was spent right at the government assistance threshold.

People form short- and long-term relationships through all sorts of initial meetings.<p>I don't see any women saying ""all flirting all is wrong at a conference"". I see them saying they don't want to be harassed. The two things are not the same. I've talked to women at length about these issues and I've championed the adoption of strong anti-harassment policies at conferences I speak at (<a href=""http://blog.urth.org/2011/09/05/conference-code-of-conduct-considered-crucial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.urth.org/2011/09/05/conference-code-of-conduct-c...</a>).<p>Maybe we just have different definitions of flirting. To get back to the original article, the Twitter exchange that it highlights is not flirting. It's just a man being an asshole. I also note that the article makes no mention of the word ""flirt"". It talks about ""harassment"", ""groping"", and ""sexism"".",1361817932

Think 'Intro to smartphones' as an hour long class at a common area in the local retirement community.<p>This has three big advantages over a traditional job.<p>1. You set the schedule. So it doesn't conflict with school/study.<p>2. Excellent monetary return on time. $10 a head and a class of 10 people is $1k. It's a good deal for them and you.<p>3. Doesn't generally require a huge level of knowledge/experience like professional development or sysadmin type work.<p>A less visible advantage, is that it broadens your network. All of your students will have your name handy if someone is looking for an intelligent IT guy.

Takes a position returns a list of ranges, applying the list of ranges to an operator produces an edit. The jump from there to regions is pretty straightforward. The system also provides a clear path to how keyboard mapping would work (along with stealing the context ideas from ST).<p>I'm unaware of an editor that works this way but I find it difficult to believe I'm the first person to think of this. If I can successfully maneuver my job into building web development tools, I expect to gut Codemirror and replace the core operations with these primitives as a top priority but I haven't gotten there yet.<p>For context sensitive stuff: You can do clever stuff with it. As an example, if you're in a JSON file, after an identifier, and you type a : the editor can automatically put quotes around the key if it's not already quoted.

5280653,comment,5275266,5275266,2,0,nayefc,,,"Here's what I've learned from talking to many startups:<p>1- First step would be a casual phone call to learn about each other. Make sure you also learn about them and ask them tough questions about their business. Both of you are interviewing each other: it's not just that they're interviewing you. You don't want to suck up to a startup which you don't believe in and end up signing an offer there.<p>2- If all goes well, most will schedule a Skype coding interview. You just have to be prepared for those and that comes from experience (which you should have from your open source experience). Don't pull an all-nighter learning algorithms as they will almost certainly ask you a question that you couldn't cover the night before. Hints: learn a dynamic interpreted and use it (Python, Ruby etc...). I made the mistake of doing those in C in the beginning and got stuck on the details / writing more code that they wanted in an hour long interview. Some were impressed by my C skills, but that's not exactly what they're testing here. Instead, most are looking at the bigger picture at this point. i.e: they're seeing if you can you write a quick draft solution, and optimize it later instead of seeing if you can properly allocate a struct in C and place different struct types in one list. (Writing such an array takes quite sometime --> they might be interested in how you'd design it instead of actually doing it at this point).<p>3- Then comes the onsite interview. This is where you get to meet the team, see the office, the location and experience a day at that startup. This is very important. Your initial gut feeling is more important than you think. If you don't feel comfortable, then do not sign an offer. You'll be at that office at least 40 hours a week with the same people. You MUST be very comfortable working with them.<p>Startups will often interview you for at least a few hours on different areas. Design, coding, algorithms etc... Just do your best and the single thing that they care about here is that you can actually write code that works and make good decisions. It does not have to be perfect, but it has to work. They're looking for someone who can build something roughly in a few hours, and then explain the shortcomings (so that it can later be optimized). Someone who can get things done, and perhaps become a leader later on. Since you've contributed to open source, you should have absolutely no problem here.<p>Good luck!",1361817069

One can reasonably expect that much of this work will surface in Meaningful Use requirements (since one of the primary objectives of MU is interoperability) and thus would force vendors, including Epic, to comply. The platform here would do the ""hard work"" of integrating under the S&I frameworks to multiple endpoints and exposing the integration through developer-friendly APIs, similar to what Eligible has done on the administrative side. We see this type of ""easy"" integration leading to more modularity for EHRs (which is supported by Meaningful Use requirements) and ultimately better end products for hospitals and patients.<p>[1]<a href=""http://wiki.siframework.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.siframework.org/</a>",1361816756

Data moves around a CPU based on the program that is executing. The control logic of a CPU is the equivalent of the routing logic of an FPGA.<p><i>On FPGAs, the routing is highly variable and must be re-negotiated at nearly every compile cycle.</i><p>The 'routing' of a CPU is the same. The compiler has to perform register allocation afresh on every compilation. There's obviously a tradeoff between fast compilation vs most efficient use of resources.

Previously, you said ""FPGAs always have to match that dense silicon through configurable silicon"".<p>Your next paragraph talks about toolchain issues. This is hardly an insurmountable problem.

HIPAA sets really harsh penalties for violations that can occur much more easily if hospitals and doctors provide open access to other facilities. Organizations are also often reluctant to provide their data to other facilities because of a perception that it will lead to a loss of competitive advantage.

You can benchmark this by timing a null build (running 'time make' after building everything). Some examples from my machine are the Linux kernel (28 seconds), and Firefox (1m 23 seconds). Some of this time is from unnecessarily recompiling things, but that is a separate issue from the inherent lack of scalability in make.<p>Suppose I want to change a single C/C++ file in one of these projects - the total turnaround time from when I type 'make' to when the build finishes can be described as:<p>T(total) = T(build system) + T(sub-processes)<p>Ideally T(total) would be zero, meaning we get an instant response from when we change the file to when we can test the result. Here, T(build system) is the null build time, and T(sub-processes) is the time it takes to run the compiler and such. Using the Linux kernel as an example again, compiling fs/ext3/balloc.c takes 0.478 seconds. In comparison to the null build of 28 seconds, there are significant gains to be had by optimizing T(build system).<p>Amdahl's Law is a little tricky to apply since tup is not parallelizing T(build system), but rather changing it from a linear-time algorithm to a logarithmic-time algorithm. So you can set P easily based on the relative values of T(build system) and T(sub-processes), but S is not a simple ""count-the-cores"" metric. The speedup is effectively N/log(N), where N is the number of files. This is much better than simple parallelization - T(build system) for tup with these projects is only about 4ms. The total turnaround time for the balloc.c file in the Linux kernel is 1.1 seconds (which includes compilation and all the linking steps afterward), in comparison to make's total turnaround time of 29.5 seconds.",1361816128

The incentives there percolate back up the research chain to ensure that few people work on genuinely groundbreaking things, or on things that are intended to do something other than treat late-stage conditions in marginal ways.<p>Yet this is an era of plummeting costs and soaring capabilities in biotech - so much can be done now with a grad student and a few tens of thousands of dollars that 20 years back would have taken tens of millions and a whole lab, if it could be done at all. In recent years I've been privileged to watch the Longecity community work through the process of crowdfunding small research projects like microglia transplants in mice to evaluate prospects for neurodegenerative treatments [4], to pick one example. That is exactly the sort of thing we'd like to see better frameworks and a broader audience for.<p>In other words, work taking place in niche fields that are important but underfunded and underappreciated, but nonetheless have strong communities with a willingness to step up and help out.<p>But as I've said, it's really, really hard.

For example, there is a non-zero probability that the murderer on the security camera is merely a person with an amazing physical similarity to the defendant. If we could develop an accurate mathematical model of human physical features, we could even estimate the probability that we're looking at a double and not the defendant.<p>Likewise, when a DNA match is used in court, the forensic scientist typically testifies to the probability of a false match. Once again, the evidence is probabilistic.<p>In both of these cases, the probability of a mistake is low. But it is non-zero, and it can be quanitified--if not with current technology, then at least in principle.<p>So, you will never get away from deciding cases probabilistically.

The flawed thinking, that calories burned by the body is a fixed amount that doesn't vary based on calories consumed, is simply wrong.  The key is that energy expenditures only rise when the calories consumed are not being partitioned for storage.  Elevated insulin levels cause storage of fatty acids, and inhibit release of fatty acids from fat cells by triggering them to be bound up into triglyceride molecules.<p>I'm not some hardcore paleo/keto/Atkins dude, but reducing carbohydrate intake (particularly refined carbs) makes appetite control much easier, by virtue of several obvous and not so obvious reasons.  The obvous is that proteins and fats fill you up more (satiety), and that could be accomplished with diets that aren't high in fat by simply upping protein intake, of course.  However, the less obvious is the energy partitioning going on with low insulin levels.

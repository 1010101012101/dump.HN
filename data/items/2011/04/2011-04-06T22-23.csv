2417361,comment,2415243,2415570,10,0,krschultz,,,"Actually, that idea is employed by every single US Navy (and I assume their foreign counterpart) submarine. The bow & stern planes combined with forward motion do almost all of the up and down depth control after you are under water. The ballast tanks are only really for changing whether you are a surface ship or a submerged ship.<p>The main disadvantage of not having ballast tanks is that on the surface, you won't float that high (I assume you will be  slightly positively buoyant, because requiring power to get back to the surface is crazy, and perfectly neutral buoyancy is nearly impossible to achieve). This doesn't matter for a little thing with a tender, but for anything on its own, I'd rather float a little higher. Also, you have to keep moving to keep lift up. That just doesn't make sense for a boat that you spend a lot of time stalking around with as much stealth as possible.<p>As for ""the most dangerous thing an attack sub can do in combat is launch a torpedo"", that's just not true. The majority of the missiles launched against Libya this month came from US subs (SSGN). And there are a lot of capabilities that are secret or borderline secret.

Based on the composition, they believe the particles are from radioactive steam, not burning fuel, which is kind of interesting.

The very interesting small molten salt breeder design FUJI MSR <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuji_MSR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuji_MSR</a> is designed to survive complete external cooling loss by shutting down fission (either under control, or by the heat physically destroying the neutron mirrors required for it's operation), and then dealing with the decay heat by conductive transfer to the environment and simply letting the reactor heat up.<p>The fact that the core is molten in normal operation, under no pressure and entirely chemically inert even at elevated temperatures makes passive safety somewhat easier.",1302130540

As you go deeper and deeper the water gets denser and denser which means the buoyant force becomes greater, which means that you have to exert a greater force to keep going down. If you rely purely on wings to exert that force, you will have to move with a pretty high velocity in order to exert sufficient force. It seems much simpler to just take on ballast and rely on good old gravity to pull you down.<p>If this thing works at all, my guess is it will have to go pretty fast, which would make it kind of dangerous and kind of hard to do exploration with.",1302130458

Not a bad UI font, I think, but it has a narrow glyph range (about 400) and only includes Latin.<p>Moving to the larger picture, my impression from the Gnome Shell desktop up to now is that it is an interesting experiment, trying to rethink as it does a lot of stuff that we have grown to take for granted in desktop environments. But it is not necessarily a good desktop experience. Up to now (I have used it for about 40 hours in total) I find it tiring and distracting, rather than distraction-free. Switching between app windows, e.g., is not a pleasant experience for me, with all the action I see on the screen and that I have to take myself each time I want to switch. (Alt-tabbing avoids all that, but I don’t always switch windows with Alt+Tab.) Another thing that does not help me, and that I find strange as an design decision, is the position of the clock right in the middle of the topbar. It causes me stress; I feel like time is hunting me.<p>In general, Gnome Shell seems to me to offer an experience more tuned to small rather than large screens. In a 2560*1600 screen, say, and if you prefer using the mouse rather than the keyboard, the distances you have to travel are ridiculous.<p>I expect the whole thing to improve in the next couple of years or so, but I am curious to see how much it can improve given its basic design principles.",1302129880

I started my own business! For about 7 hours of my life I didn't know what I was going to do if I couldn't bloom at 37signals, and then I told David and Jason I was starting my own company, CoSupport.us.<p>True: I left 37signals because I really wanted to do more support-wise, and the needs of the company didn't mesh with my ideas. They need people full-time on support, they don't need someone who's not there responding to tickets. After 4 years of answering 100+ emails a day, I wanted to do other things. Needing me on tickets interacting with customers is what Jason means when he says they can't have people working on a team not doing the work <i>of</i> the team.<p>True: David and Jason may sometimes come off a bit stiff, perhaps even cold, when it comes to how they manage their business, but that's the unfortunate aspect of print, edits, etc. In truth, working for them was the most challenging, educational, inspirational time of my career so far. They are the opposite of cold when it comes to their employee's ambition, ideas, talent and goals.<p>True: My experience leaving was equivalent to a professional football player saying to his coach, ""Hey I think I want to try being a referee!"" The player isn't on the team to be a referee. If he wants to be a referee, he needs to go to referee school and become a referee, not say, ""I'm going to stay on the football team and be a referee, too."" That's not how it works in football, or at 37signals.<p>False: I was not at all ""rewarded"" for my ambition by being shut down, put down, held down, or in <i>any</i> way shuttered by David or Jason. I was rewarded by them telling me I had too much ambition to be contained there, and by them supporting my new company as best they can.<p>False: I actually did my first job for 37signals in 2005, and started full-time in March 2007.

Having a good ride database is definitely cool, but there are existing ride databases out there (EveryTrail, RideWithGPS).  What there isn't though, is an adhoc notification system for going on rides.  What would be really cool to have is a mobile app that notified me when someone was going to start a ride in my area.  As a motorcycle rider myself, I don't often plan on going riding a couple days in advance, I just get the itch to get out and go and will usually take off within 30-60 minutes from getting that itch. If I could, using my phone or the site, declare I was leaving on a ride and have that published, and anyone in the area also subscribed to the area could consume it (be notified automatically), that would be really cool.  I would focus more on connecting people than on mapping.  From my experience with ridewithgps, motorcyclists are more social hungry than data/map hungry, so I think you'll find better traction with this approach.  Obviously you want to keep up with the mapping portion so you can have your marketing ideas work out, but I wouldn't make it the foreground of the user experience.",1302128665

They just need to be readily convertible to plaintext when they pull your data. I'm thinking about a system where credentials are encrypted and access to the keys are locked down (either via software or hardware) so that engineers and operations don't have unimpeded access.<p>> Just change ""Yodlee"" to ""your bank"" and the same exact problems happen. There is nothing special about Yodlee here.<p>Two things:<p>1a. Like I already said, many banks protect their users from losses incurred if someone gets hacked while using the bank's online portal. They'll bail me out if someone gets access to my account and takes all my money. Will they bail me out if Yodlee is used as an attack vector? That would be nice but I'm not convinced that banks/brokerages/etc. will step up and help me out in that situation. Ideologically I don't even know if banks should be <i>expected</i> to.<p>1b. Will <i>Yodlee</i> bail me out if an attacker uses them to steal all my money? Nothing on their website indicates that they will. Even if they did, implementing these risky features just adds more risk and uncertainty to their business for a feature which isn't ultimately that worthwhile.<p>2. Yodlee is special because they're an aggregator. That makes them a significantly more valuable target than one bank alone. I have various accounts at various places, if someone got access to one of them at least the damage is contained. With Yodlee they get everything at once.<p>> And when Yodlee asks them for their bank's password they don't realize what's going on?<p>You'd hope so but can't assume, you're not just selling to technical and security-conscious users. Most of Moneycenter is looks like it's dedicated to read operations. There are just a few innocuous-looking links in the account management section which opens up this whole can of worms. I came to Yodlee from Mint, who doesn't expose <i>anything</i> in their UI which would allow writes. That was my expectation because write access via this kind of service is unthinkable to me. After I explored a bit and realized this I removed all my accounts.<p>> It's exactly the opposite of what you think - by letting you know they have the password you will be more security conscious with them. If that feature did not exist you might think that they were a ""read only view"".<p>I get where you're coming from but I think this is a stretch. If they're really trying to be upfront with their users about what can and can't be done they would be more explicit than two links for ""auto-login"" and ""show my password"".<p>Maybe the disconnect is that I want a read-only financial aggregator (i.e. Mint) whereas Yodlee tries to do more... but from my brief experience with Yodlee I didn't really even see many things that directly did writes. Most of the value I saw was in the reading/reporting.<p>> Do you think it works by magic? How do you think it logs you in to the other site? It uses your password! It makes an auto submitting form that has your password in it, in plain text, right there in the javascript!<p>Sorry, I wasn't really clear in my haste to edit the last reply. I know auto-login is only trivially and superficially different from showing a plaintext password. That's why I didn't even mention it at first.<p>EDIT: Actually I think the current implementation of auto-login may be worse than showing the password in cleartext. IIRC the user doesn't have to provide Yodlee credentials a second time like they do to view their bank password.",1302127327

2417181,comment,2415160,2415160,1,0,slee029,,,"While I completely agree that flat vs a vertical hierarchy should be assessed from organization to organization, I tend to prefer flat structures mainly because they allow for the culture to mold perception of progression over an existing structure itself. What I mean by this is that if you have a structured way for internal progression (usually vertical) people mold their perceptions around that ladder no matter how much you try convincing them otherwise.<p>You can clearly see this being played out within the big 4 accounting firms (I recruited for them and from them). Within the firms its extremely vertical in that progression is dictated largely by how long you stayed until you hit partnership where its strictly vacancy. Thus, you're basically looking at steady yearly promotions until you reach being a senior manager after 6-8 years within the firm.<p>This is where I was able to take the most senior people usually in a seasonal manner pretty easily. This is because after being a senior manager you really have only two trajectories within the firm, associate partner or partner. The AP is basically a position they created to please senior managers who sounded too old and weren't good enough to be partners. So what you generally see is 3-4 hotshot senior managers all vying for the 1 partnership position that will be available that season/year. Inevitably I'll have 3/4 partner potential senior managers leaving because they know they're better off leaving the firm and going to an industry position or worse a competitive firm. They already know the stigma of being an AP.<p>Thus, you don't simply see attrition at the top level, but the attrition of the very best at the top level and the rest being APs. What's worse is those guys who are the best usually have a loyal following within the firm. Well guess who gives me a call after placing that senior manager as a hiring manager where they're building a team? Now you see an attrition of even better people who you were probably underpaying at junior positions leaving the firm for better pay and better hours. The only guiding light there is you're hoping that senior manager becomes their client in the future.<p>Thus, you see a system where the highly vertical nature of the structure led to a culture where attrition was the norm. While it might be naive to think so, I think being a flat structure might give a better chance for the culture to shape that perception of the promotion and have them ""feel"" it rather than perceive it.",1302127269

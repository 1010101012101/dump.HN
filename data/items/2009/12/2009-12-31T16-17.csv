We have a variety of options for building and deploying apps and a wide range of pricing. From 3 cents per minute in the cloud to enterprise apps with SLAs that run the voice applications for some of the world's largest companies.<p>For our enterprise customers, many of them prefer to use the w3c standard VoiceXML to avoid vendor lock-in. Some of them also use our proprietary CallXML, a simplified language for building apps. These apps run on our carrier-grade hosting facilities in the US and Europe or at the customer's data centers.<p>For web devlopers, we have Tropo.com, a cloud service offers APIs for popular web programming languages. Build in PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy, or Python, with more options coming shortly. Pay as you go, develop in your native language, and run your apps in a cloud on top of the same infrastructure our enterprise hosting customers use.<p>It's more than voice. Using one code base, your app can not only make and receive phone calls, but also send and receive SMS messages and interact over IM and Twitter.<p>As rjurney mentioned, we're developer friendly. You can create an account on either Tropo or on our enterprise hosting for free and run there as long as you need to without charge. We don't put any artificial limits on our dev platforms. We'll give you a dedicated phone number for your app. We'll also give you Skype numbers, SIP addresses, an XMPP address, and a toll-free number. Build and test your app, hand it to your friends to try out. When you're ready to move to production, let us know.",1262278737

1024510,comment,1022430,1022430,0,0,jamii,,,"The arguments here all seem to assume that you're writing the code yourself. I think the best argument against rampant global state is when dealing with other peoples code.<p>An example from a couple of months back. I was using an open source library for parsing LaTeX code before it was added to a search index. After getting the alpha version up and running I ran into a subtle bug - malformed input such as ""$$ \dot{C}O_2"" would break every future parse of any mathematical input. So somewhere in this 20k loc library a global variable is not being reset after parsing. Since this is an imperative language there is no way to figure out which part of the call chain is calling which global variables so I potentially have to read every line of code of find it.<p>After two days I managed to track it down by writing a script that reads the source code to identify every static global variable in the code and tracks their values between calls. This is not the ideal way to find bugs.",1262278468

I don't think that follows, and the knowledge that if you post something, the reply is unlikely to be a one line attempt at humour encourages longer more thoughtful comments.<p>> Maybe that's the goal, I don't know. But it makes for boring reading and conversation.<p>No, it makes for very interesting reading and occasional actual conversation rather than banter.<p>> The opportunity to have some interesting discourse on that topic is now dead.<p>Dead here. You could post it at reddit and see what happens. You seem to be present at HN, so presumably you like it, yet only be in favour of downvoting spam and offensive stuff. If you do that, it's not HN anymore it's a general news aggregator. It can't be at the same time about a restricted set of ideas and topics selected by the votes of the people who are here, and also open to everyone to comment anything on any topic, that's contradictory.<p>> I perfectly understand your desire to seek out interesting and relevant discussion to your particular areas of interest. If something doesn't fit your areas of interest, feel free to not participate, don't penalize us that do want to participate.<p>Or, you could find somewhere else where LOLprogrammers comics are relevant, and don't penalize 'us' who don't want to participate by trying to change here so that is relevant here as well.<p>Given that not-everything is OK here, there will be people who don't fit in, don't like what is posted and don't like what is excluded. If that's not what you want, the choices are to find or start somewhere else where the limited subset of things more aligns with you, or to break open every niche and limited site until everywhere has everything as an allowed topic.<p>I'm not trying to say that everything I like should be allowed and you should go away, I'm trying to say that people who are present are shaping HN with votes and sometimes I agree and sometimes I don't and if and when I disagree more than agree it will be time for me to change or leave.

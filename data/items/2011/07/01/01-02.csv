Right now we have something like 95% of all app purchases done from OS 5 and OS 6 devices, so going back to OS 4.6 has not been considered worth it for many developers for some time now. I do it just to be nice to my users but I get less than 2% OS 4.6ers coming in.<p>In general RIM has been really good at pushing users to upgrade their devices so in practice you would see most 8900 buyers come out with OS 5 on their device.",1309485494

He is familiar with technology I have designed. He has an idea to enhance it with new functions, combining it with another technology he has licensed and market the combined product. He already has 10 employees, an office, an incorporated company, a working prototype board, and a reasonable contract. Before the end of the week we have signed a contract, which I had no concerns about, and he has written me a check for $1.2 million. I then ramp up, hire, expand and integrate my designs with his, and a year later the product is demonstrated at trade shows which leads to sales.<p>Here is an example of an incompetent idea guy. He wants to make umbrellas, briefcases, and hats that are made out of fabric which is a combination solar array and video screen. They will be self powered and show video advertisements which are downloaded wirelessly and which create income for the umbrella user. He has no technology for any of this, but that is my job. It should be a simple matter since solar, wireless and screens are all mature industries. I am to fund all development and manufacturing in return for 5% equity in his new concern.<p>That one is probably the most coherent and well developed of the ""ideas"" I have heard over the years from these characters. Don't worry, he has contacts in the industry, connections that will make UmbrellaScreen Ltd a guaranteed billion dollar company. It can't possibly fail.",1309485415

They provide a lot of insight and perspective that a techie might not have. They see the world in a very different way and can provide ideas we might have never thought of. Not to mention they will most likely be better at sales and marketing than any of us. However, the ultimate resource they can provide is time. Since they cannot sit down and code the product, they can spend their time working to build buzz and find customers so that when it is launch time you already have a customer base lined up.

It works like Livejournal friend filters. The groups are relative to whatever you define and it is not global across the entire domain, unlike with Unix groups.<p>To implement circles/friends list as Unix groups, you would have to introduce the concept of namespaces in which the set of groups is scoped within a namespace. Then you attach individual namespaces for each person. In other words, named sets of named sets. The named sets themselves are not global, even though the members are.<p>So I just checked again.

Unlike social networking where the other person has to accept your invitation and become a part of facebook before he/she starts receving your posts, google+ does not mandate it. You can add a person to circles even if he does not have a gmail id or google+ account and still make them respond to your posts. Google seems to be banking on the popularity of gmail, people who use gmail are generally very supportive of google and like google, so many of them will give it a try atleast. These 700 million number thrown about is not very usesful or won't matter much. The fact is most people have around 10 close friends and 50 people they care about, rest are just noise. 700 million is a worldwide number, Google does not need to care really about worldwide numbers initially.

2716529,story,,,8,10,jim_h,"ASK NH: What are your thoughts/experiences with 'unlimited vacation days'?",,"I recently got introduced to the concept of 'unlimited vacation days'.  It was a big surprise, but after thinking about it for a while I'm a bit skeptical.  I did some research on it and in particular read an NPR article.  The articles gives a few examples of people taking a few vacations, but they're relatively normal lengths.  Each individual's example were 6 weeks for baby, 1 month vacation, 3 months (after NO vacation for THREE years).  The length of the vacations are not extreme or too out of ordinary considering the situations, especially for the new baby and never having taken a vacation for 3 years.<p>I can see the advantage for someone who currently has 2-3 weeks of vacation to increase to 'unlimited vacation days' and then take 4-5 weeks in a year.  However for people who already have an above average number of vacation days (5 weeks or more), it doesn't seem like an advantage to have 'unlimited' vacation days.  In a field of people all with 'unlimited' days, it seems like you would be an outlier  if you attempted to take more days than the rest.<p>What are your thoughts or experiences with this concept?  Also, how many days have you (or someone you know) actually taken with unlimited vacation days.",1309482696

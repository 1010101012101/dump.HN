What does this imply about what a piano looks like?  Or a stereo system?  Or a flashbang?<p>It even only <i>extremely slightly</i> implies how sound-creating things function, given that they could inject themselves at any point in that process.  They could vibrate air.  They could vibrate our jawbones.  They could cause electrical impulses directly.  And this discounts future creations - maybe we discover a way to induce momentum, vibrating our eardrums without doing so by vibrating the air.  And it <i>entirely</i> ignores synaesthesia, whereby we could create sound by looking at a light or smelling a cookie.<p>Or lets take the programmer approach: the spec is an interface.

2122224,comment,2120805,2121169,0,0,russell,,,"The Drake Equation has so many fuzzy unknowns that you cant get meaningful information out of it, if rephrased right we could get some meaning variables to play with.  If we want to know if there are possible communication partners right now, we can figure out some of the unknowns.  First the definition of an earth like planet.  It has liquid water and dry land.  Liquid water, because the only kind of life we know of developed in liquid water. Dry land because developing a communicating technology requires an abiulity to isolate your experiments.  I believe there are so many impediments under water that a technological civilization would never develop.  So a technological civilization requires 4B years to develop from the birth of a star.  The habitable zone of a star is where water is liquid roughly. An earth-like planet must have inhabited a continuously habitable zone for 4B years.  A flare star may not have a continuously habitable zone.  An M star's habitable zone may be so close to the start that the planet is in a tidal lock with the star.  An enterprising astrophysist can probably estimate the probability of a sufficently large stable habital zone for a given class of stars.  We dont have enough \ndata for estimating the probability of a water/dry land world being there.<p>Given life and enough time, what is the probability of a technological civilization arising.  1.0 or so small that we are alone.  We are probably at the age and interconnectedness that we will survive a very long time.  I \ndont wory about nuclear war, but I do worry about  bio-terror and nut cases.<p>I think the big constraint is patience.  I dont think any civilization is ready to invest the time and energy to wait 1000 years for a reply.  I think the potential partners will be limited to a volume of 100 light years. \nMaybe 5000 stars, not all that many.",1295488608

Kongregate can distribute it's app outside the app store, though I hear you guys about AT&T blocking apps outside the store. I might take this off my list if Google starts doing more evil down the road.<p>2. The main reason: Kongregate is free to bundle each of those games as a separate app and put them on the store. The lawyers can argue all they want about whether the Kongregate app violates the TOS by being an app store, but certainly it violates the agreement in spirit.<p>Has anyone here dealt with the WildTangent client? It does roughly what the Kongregate app is designed to do, but on Windows. It lives in memory and tries to download new games at regular intervals.

I'm guessing 2 or 3 T-bones and about 4 hours clearing up an intersection.<p>For this system to work, all traffic lights will need to be reliably broadcasting their status and how long they're going to be remaining in it so that either the fleet can stop, or so that some of the cars can drop out to avoid running a red.<p>It would also need to communicate with other vehicles. I can turn right (or left in some occasions here in Canada) on a red if I've got the room, but how do I tell if my fleet has the room? If the truck driver becomes liable for risking my vehicle then he's only ever going to move on his light and when he knows he has the time, which will only cripple intersections with congestion.<p>It's a great idea and I can't wait for the day, but our road system is overly complex as it is and these systems will need to be equally as complex to guarantee safety.<p>Edit: Also the driver of the fleet vehicles would need to know the destination and what exit the lead is taking. If I'm going to Montreal, I don't want to end up in downtown Toronto and spend forever trying to get back on the highway. Similarly, it will be especially dangerous if I'm just 'dropped' from the fleet due to a communication problem or if my vehicle doesn't follow because the lead is exiting before my destination is set to.<p>IMO this system would do best as an advancement of an auto-driver system that can read lights and signals, etc. itself without endangering the driver.",1295487445

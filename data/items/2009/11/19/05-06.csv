They send occasional emails with a ""Login Instantly"" button which contain an authentication token.<p>In general, if someone can read your email, they can steal almost any of your accounts. Are email accounts generally that insecure? I trust any major Webmail provider to not steal my bank account, but is trust the only thing really keeping our bank accounts secure?<p>If we really are that insecure, then people are probably going to attack your bank account long before they attack your random web-app account. If your site isn't guarding valuables, it's probably perfectly ""safe"" to send authentication tokens in mail messages. No?",1258610089

(Presumably people don't admit to being pedophiles, so you can't find a random sample of them to study. You can study pedophiles who get caught, but presumably those are the least intelligent pedophiles, so you can't draw conclusions about pedophile intelligence from them. I think it's safer to assume pedophiles have a normal distribution of intelligence.)",1258609509

You can't get more corporate than that.<p>I had a co-worker say this to me last week - ""I just feel like [our manager] treats people like resources, batteries if you will.""<p>He complains a lot and his department transfer is going poorly, but I couldn't help but agree with him here.<p>To say that its creative writing, painting, or composing is frankly dead on. I don't have to convince our audience here that is true, especially anyone who has seen a <i>truly elegant solution</i> to a problem.<p>Corporate software definitely sucks as a rule, I believe, because the passion and motivation for excellence has been sucked out of them. I was discussing design philosophy (as related to a structure/organization question) with my <i>technical team lead</i> and he said something to the effect of (not far from verbatim), <i>""Yeah, I'm not really passionate about [design philosophy], I usually follow whats there.""</i><p>This is a guy that supposed to be leading a group of developers. Over a year and a half I have determined that taking a diplomatic approach to design and programming issues isn't always the best solution. It leads to disconnected and mangled code.<p>Apple is different in this regard because the CEO was, and at heart (hopefully), still is a programmer (despite app store mayhem - everyone makes mistakes). The market has noticed and felt the difference. <i>(Also notice how Apple doesn't do a lot - if any - corporate level development.)</i><p>I agree with your stance completely and am willing to make the bold statement that the only person that should lead an organization that produces software as a direct product for consumers should be someone that has developed before and still has the passion about the <i>art</i>.<p><i>(Edit: a quick side note to all of this - I have friends that are in the Silicon Valley area and quit IBM way before I contemplated it. At first I thought they were whiny because they didn't get to write python code but what it comes down to is they understood and accepted the fundamental breakdown between organizational behavior and the art of computer science.)</i>",1258608052

Foul play was suspected.  It turns out that the values in the DES s-boxes were very resistant to differential cryptanalysis, much more than they would have been if they were selected randomly.  Either the NSA knew this technique back in the 70s or the IBM researchers figured it out and agreed to keep it secret (both claims have been made); it was not until independent discovery in the 90s that we all learned why the s-boxes had those specific values.",1258606934

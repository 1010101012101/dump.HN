A full blown anarchy, massive revolutions? It seems to me that there is no reasoning with this people and that riots (or something such) are the only was to go here (if it comes that far).

3616039,comment,3615099,3615099,1,0,bravura,,,"In short, GraphLab is a parallel programming abstraction. It is slightly low-level than MapReduce. Many algorithms can be written in a scalable way in the GraphLab framework that, were they written in MapReduce, they would not scale correctly. Which is to say that MapReduce is too high-level to implement many useful data processing algorithms, but GraphLab is at the appropriate level of abstraction.<p>I asked about GraphLab on MetaOptimize, and the authors of GraphLab gave some high-level information:<p><a href=""http://metaoptimize.com/qa/questions/285/when-should-you-prefer-graphlab-over-mapreduce-and-vice-versa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metaoptimize.com/qa/questions/285/when-should-you-pre...</a><p>Note that this Q+A was done before the paper was published (but was based upon the camera-ready). I believe that the code has matured since then, but it might not yet be ready for production.<p>Joseph Gonzalez: ""MapReduce is good for single-iteration and embarassingly parallel distributed tasks like feature processing, while GraphLab is good for iterative algorithms with computational dependencies or complex asynchronous schedules. For instance, we find that GraphLab is highly suitable for Gibbs sampling, EM-style algorithms and some classes of optimization algorithms. Programs which fit well on a systolic abstraction (such as PageRank on Pregel) will also work well with GraphLab. There are probably a lot more algorithms that will fit well in the GraphLab and we are still exploring the capabilities and implications of the abstraction (and whether further extensions will be needed).""",1329821836

There are very few in the world at this age who can speak 10+ languages.<p>Are you speaking from authority as a polyglot yourself? Because I haven't heard this opinion before. The uniformity does ease the burden slightly of learning a language but it's a small role in achieving fluency.<p>I think you could go from zero to having full command of the Spanish grammar in a couple of weeks. I did it self taught in a month or two with a Michel Thomas CDs in a single grammar thin book. If you have the mind for it, learning language structure of a Romance or Germanic language is not too much of a challenge.<p>What then takes _years_ is vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, pronunciation, idiomatic usage, and the fast application of the grammar you've learned. For me, what took a long time was training my brain to think fast enough that I could decode the target language fast enough to hold fluent conversation and, later, get my brain fast enough thinking in the target language. This is hardly ""learning local variations and nuances"", it is what takes up 90%+ of reaching a ""fluency"" and it's something every language learner must go through, whether they already speak 1 or 8 languages.<p>I am starting learning German, and i'm going through the same process as with Spanish. It's really not hard to laern the principals of the language, the sentence structure and verbal agreement, gender etc. But _using it at a natural speed_ so you can conversion in German - that's a mammoth job and takes months or years.<p>Perhaps your programming anology holds, but reaching a ""fluency"" means you can go hours or days of coding without ever reaching for a reference document. Sure took me a long time to get there.",1329821702

Published by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), the report is blessedly free of educational cant. Heres how it begins:<p>Grammar is important because it is the language that makes it possible for us to talk about language. Grammar names the types of words and word groups that make up sentences not only in English but in any language. As human beings, we can put sentences together even as childrenwe can all do grammar. But to be able to talk about how sentences are built, about the types of words and word groups that make up sentencesthat is knowing about grammar. And knowing about grammar offers a window into the human mind and into our amazingly complex mental capacity.<p>People associate grammar with errors and correctness. But knowing about grammar also helps us understand what makes sentences and paragraphs clear and interesting and precise. Grammar can be part of literature discussions, when we and our students closely read the sentences in poetry and stories. Knowing about grammar means finding out that all languages and all dialects follow grammatical patterns.",1329821242

3616003,comment,3615884,3615972,8,0,swombat,,,"Disclaimer: Pure opinion. I only speak 3 languages reasonably fluently, and have a basic to moderate understanding of a few others. It's not like there's any scientific backing for this method, though.<p>Step 1: bootstrap. Before you can really learn the language, you need to set up some basic structures in your mind for that language. You need a basic understanding of grammar, a few useful sentence patterns, etc. You need those to be wired in so that they can be called upon in conversation, so just reading is no good - you have to both listen and speak. I've found the Pimsleur courses to be excellent for this bootstrapping, especially those that have 3 sets of lessons (3x30 half-hour lessons = pretty solid bootstrapping), but even with just one you get some solid basics like simple sentences, numbers, basic grammar, etc.<p>Step 2: grow basic vocabulary. Even after bootstrapping, you'll still have a vocabulary that's way too limited to engage in meaningful conversation (though at least you can have uber-simple conversations like asking for prices, directions, and being polite). At this point you need vocabulary - a lot of it. The best way I've found to build this is to read, with a good dictionary and (if the language needs it) verb conjugation book handy so that you can actually understand things. Basically, take beginner-level reading materials, and, with a pencil in hand, read, paragraph by paragraph. While you read the paragraph, underline words you're not 100% sure about (but don't stop reading until you get to the end of the paragraph). Once you're finished with a paragraph, look things up and write the definitions in the margins. By the time you've read 2-3 beginner books like this, you can probably handle a simple conversation about a topic other than the price of a train ticket.<p>Step 3: total immersion. This is the key step, and you can even skip the previous two if you're in a rush, and go straight for that, but then it'll be very hard and you'll waste a lot of ""prime time"" (i.e. time spent surrounded exclusively by native speakers) learning the basics you could have learned at home. In this step, you need to speak only that language for at least a few weeks, ideally three months or so. Stay away from people who speak your native language (i.e. don't hang around with exchange students or whatever, however ""safe"" that may seem, since it will destroy the main benefit of this). Speak only the target language, and within a few weeks something magical will happen: you'll switch from thinking in english and translating, to thinking directly in the target language. This is the holy grail. At this point, you can speak. You may still have a LOT to learn (depending on the language... e.g. with Chinese, well done, you can speak - now you can learn to read ideograms, which is twice as hard), but you've got enough of the building blocks that you don't need a deliberate system other than speaking to people in that language and reading stuff in that language. The more you speak/read, the better you'll get.<p>Have fun!",1329821173

Frankly, I've never been good at languages.<p>English is the one single language I learned and feel comfortable with, everything else failed (most notably I tried several times to learn Italian, now I'm in Israel and start to doubt if I'll ever have a conversation in Hebrew).<p>Maybe you are right about emerging patterns, and in fact that is exactly what the guy claims in the BBC video at the end: It becomes easier the more languages you learn. But still, I'm honestly impressed by speaking a large amount of languages fluently (i.e. no stuttering, freely, without a hard accent - and without starting to mix languages due to context switches).<p>""All similarly structured"": I guess I have to take your word for it. Coming from Germany I haven't found a language that feels like a good match so far (disclaimer applies again of course: I suck at languages). To me, Russian and Dutch/Afrikaans kind of don't mix.<p>And the final, most impressive feat for me is: Handling the conflicts, not the similarities. A chair - does it have a gender in the language at hand? Which one? What are the consequences? Are you talking to a male or female person? Does this change your sentence? What are the languages ~basic~ irregularities (think numbering, for example).<p>Some of these examples are things that I'd imagine being hard learning German. Some are issues that I have with learning Hebrew. I'm impressed.",1329820809

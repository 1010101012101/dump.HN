2967908,comment,2967578,2967672,13,0,jerf,,,"I'm not sure the fact that kids can ""learn"" language X proves much, because generally we're teaching kids language X so they can take some kid-friendly subset of the language and do kid projects in it. This is great on its own, but showing that kids can learn Scala or Haskell doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to be able to <i>program</i> in it.<p>Here's a group using Haskell: <a href=""http://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/09/03/haskell-for-kids-week-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/09/03/haskell-for-kids-wee...</a> Are they choking and dying because Haskell is just too magically difficult for children to learn? Goodness, no. On the other hand, does this prove that Haskell is never confusing when you're three layers deep in monad transformers trying to use a parsing library and you get a twenty-line error message about a failure to unify types with type signatures bigger than Twitter will let you post full of ""a"" and ""t1"" and ""t2"" and ""t3""s?<p>I mean, let's be honest, that just doesn't happen when you're using Python or Perl. (It can in Java, but still a lot of times it's just <i>verbose</i>, vs. Haskell's actual <i>complexity</i>.)",1315357140

The alleged practice has been linked to mass graves where the remains of more than 400 people have been unearthed in recent months.<p>""We've been given several suggestions that this kind of activity happens,"" a source at the US Drug Enforcement Agency told The Times.<p>A source with links to the drug trade said he had heard detailed accounts of the new blood sport. ""The violence has reached such a level, even the gangsters are getting sick of it,"" he added.<p>Mexico's northern border regions have suffered an explosion of violence as government forces battle the Zetas -- a drug gang formed in the 1990s by former soldiers -- and their former bosses, the powerful Gulf cartel, in a three-way war.<p>The conflict has claimed nearly 35,000 victims in the past five years, according to official figures, but the true toll may never be known. Since 2006 at least 5,300 Mexicans have disappeared. Witnesses have reported seeing large groups of people being snatched from intercity buses by gangs who appear to act with impunity.<p>Some kidnap victims have had one hand handcuffed to a car steering wheel, and a gun placed in the other, to be sent on murder missions. Others have been found hanged in the streets. Most of 200 bodies discovered in mass graves in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas were of victims apparently killed with sledgehammers or burnt alive.<p>A report in the Houston Chronicle, which drew on an account from an anonymous drug runner, said: ""The elderly are killed. Young women are raped. And able-bodied men are given hammers, machetes and sticks and forced to fight to the death.""",1315356825

When I encounter a library or language that makes a big deal about being ""declarative"", I now consider that a black mark against it, not a feature, because what that translates to is usually ""You still have to tell it how to get the thing you want, but since we thought we could abstract away all such performance issues, we've made it impossible to introspect or fix any performance issues you may encounter, and the language will require bizarre contortions to get acceptable performance.""<p>Example the first and one of the biggest: SQL. Sure, it's a declarative language... after you learn how databases work, after you learn how indexes work, after you profile your biggest hitting queries and work out how to rewrite them into semantically equivalent queries that perform orders of magnitude faster, after you learn how to deal with sharding, after you learn when to denormalize and when not to, after you learn the necessary performance hacks that trick the indexer into doing what you need instead of what it thinks is correct, and after a few more things I could go on about, it's a declarative language where you don't have to worry about performance any more. Yup, totally declarative.<p>I like Haskell, but only because I can <i>mostly</i> (although not entirely) see through it.<p><i>""The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong, it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair.""</i> - Douglas Adams<p>Anything that claims to be declarative is lying. All declarations in some given environment entail some process that will be used to obtain your results, you will not be able to get good performance if you don't know that process, and actively obscuring those processes only makes it harder.<p>You can't afford to ignore the side effects of ""pure"" functions.",1315355881

They are more often a way for city employees and the city to make some money, and often the city architects/building inspectors are in on the game. It is the only form of outright bribery I've seen firsthand in this country, but for my contractor friends it is a part of everyday life. Typically you pay some fee for the city to look at drawings before you do anything and then if you want the building inspector to actually show up and rate it well you might be asked to grease the wheels to speed up the process. It's pretty unfortunate and I didn't think these types of things happened but they definitely do.<p>My properties are in Chicago and Pittsburgh and that is certainly the case in those cities (much worse in Chicago), not sure if it's the case in SF, but I would be willing to guess that it is.",1315355362

When data access paths are not pre-defined e.g. URL, slug, tag, etc., a systematic way to organize and query is required.  Three examples: (a) not knowing what user may query, text indexing today almost index every words.  (b) given predefined access path, NNTP have used mostly files.  (c) mail servers have both.  IMO, in general, addressing domain specific requirements, database systems (relational, logical, network...) are not slower, harder to update/ backup.  As pointed out in another comment, disk IO is slow.  Both file and database systems feature various ways to speed that.  Understanding requirements, then architect, design, and choose a solution stack carefully.",1255478183

If I made a Twitter comment saying that I hated New York City, while I was head of a PR firm for the New York Stock Exchange, I would not expect to get a similar response.<p>> <i>many of my peers and I question the expense of paying Ketchum to produce the video open for today’s event; work that could have been achieved by internal, award-winning professionals with decades of experience in television production.</i><p>This seems more like the crux of the issue. Someone pissed off that the company didn't use him or his working group and instead outsourced the work.<p>> <i>Not knowing exactly what prompted your comments, I will admit the area around our airport is a bit of an eyesore, not without crime, prostitution, commercial decay, and a few potholes.</i><p>He even admits that it's possible the @keyinfluencer had a bad experience with the town. So @keyinfluencer's comment could have been totally acceptable within the context of the experience that he had had with Memphis at the point.<p>This whole 'response' comes off as a gross over-reaction. Much in the same light as the guy that writes a 12-page essay in response to an off-hand comment that there are 'many inconsistencies' in the Bible. The guy writes the letter/essay not because it is justified, but because someone has hit a sore spot and he feels a need to 'react' to what he views as some sort of 'transgression.'<p>In this case, I feel like the 'transgression' is probably not 'insulting my city' so much as 'he took mah jerb!' But he couldn't outright say something like, ""this guy's an assclown and I don't like him,"" so he used this off-handed comment as an excuse. Notice how he CC'd this to <i>all</i> the FexEx upper-ups. He clearly is trying to give them the impression that they need to drop this 'outsourced' company and bring the work back in-house.",1255475779

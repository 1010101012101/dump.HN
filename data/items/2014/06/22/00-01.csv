Same problem in C++. You can make a lot of optimizations to assembler if you can guarantee a value won&#x27;t change, or if the relative location in memory needs to remain static because anything can rip the address and do awful pointer arithmetic with it.<p>I like to compare to asm.js - it is a reduced language in that it restricts the environment from doing things it can&#x27;t easily optimize away, except in that case its to assembler. Reduced set versions of C exist to do the same already, but it would be nicer if you just had a fast language default with straightforward rules with ways to just declare wonderland functionality that can mess things up that means the compiler needs to preserve the machine assumptions rather than the language structures.",1403398154

Though I would argue it&#x27;s worth using something like UITabBar to switch between log and charts if charts is something you use a lot.<p>* When tapping on a transaction to bring up the context buttons, consider allowing tapping anywhere on the screen to dismiss it, not just on cells.<p>* Consider a custom input view for the amount field, here&#x27;s an example of what I did for my app (<a href=""http://imgur.com/yp27cxK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/yp27cxK</a>), gets rid of the ugly &quot;dialer&quot; style ABC/DEF/GHI annotations. More maintenance though.<p>* Understand its for you mainly, but tag editing would be nice :)<p>* When you have a couple of thousand transactions in there (I had 20,000), being able to quickly whip up some adhoc queries for interesting stats becomes a lot easier if you have an SQL backed data model, and I used SQLite+transactions just because I was paranoid of some stupid bug corrupting all the data. Knowing myself, I would delete an app the first time it lost any data.<p>However, long term, I think the solution for this kind of app is direct integration with banks (one of the reasons I lost interest, because I started getting super tired of typing in the data on a phone)!<p>Best of luck, and keep on iterating!

7926482,comment,7925493,7926396,2,0,bunderbunder,,,"> The models don&#x27;t tell us why the planet was warm and then it was in an ice age, they don&#x27;t tell us why it stopped being in an ice age in the first place, they don&#x27;t tell us anything how our actions (or inaction) could cause the climate to change in a way that we wish it to change.<p>This criticism is somewhat akin to trying to challenge the theory of relativity because our orbital models can&#x27;t tell us exactly how the planets got arranged how they did.  The reason they can&#x27;t isn&#x27;t because the models are broken; it&#x27;s because there are many plausible hypotheses that could give rise to the outcome we see, and representing various possible combinations of historical parameters.  And we can&#x27;t necessarily know which set of parameters without the aid of a time machine.<p>Similarly for the climate models.  They can&#x27;t tell us exactly how every historical change in the climate happened because there are many climate forcings that simply aren&#x27;t recorded very well (or at all) in the historical record. So we can use the models to come up with various plausible scenarios, but we&#x27;d need a time machine to figure out which one is the correct one.<p>To take another analogy, this criticism&#x27;s akin to when creationists complain of the relative fuzziness of our knowledge of the history of life in the precambrian to argue that evolution cannot account for the major taxonomic divisions in the tree of life.  Again, the truth is that the model is fine, what&#x27;s inadequate is our knowledge of the historical conditions we would need to feed into that model.<p>The distinction between those two sorts of knowledge gap may seem pedantic and hair-splitty, but an understanding of the nature and implications of that difference is one of the boundaries that separates science from pseudoscience.",1403397367

I feel that PD is an excellent learning tool if you want to learn about synthesis or DSP more generally, but as a musician&#x27;s tool it&#x27;s just not ready. A lot of the music made with PD is pure crap, or even a type of anti-music, or puts forward some kind of alternate musical theory of its own which nobody can understand. PD music is usually too detached from normal conventions such as 12 TET, harmonies and progressions to be listenable. Typically the PD user will produce something with weird bell sounds, stuttering percussive noises or massive pad washes going in and out. Not conventional music. The reason is that PD doesn&#x27;t provide enough built-in function shortcuts. If you want to make music, PD is a practically useless interface. By the time you&#x27;ve programmed a very basic synth, any inspiration has long gone. An instrument is something that should need no foreplay beyond just turning it on and picking it up, before actually playing it. If you want to make something recognizable as music with PD, you will need to first download someone else&#x27;s synth patch or copy a subtractive or FM synth from a book first.

Regardless, I appreciate you taking the time to better explain your position.<p>With that said, I still disagree with your conclusion that Sun and Oracle has no &quot;cultural tradition of taking toolchain usability seriously&quot;.  Again, I strongly disagree and believe that does not apply to all products or projects.<p>Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t apply to the degree that you want, but you are claiming that it doesn&#x27;t exist at all, and I can assure you that was / is not the case based on people I know that have worked on many of those projects.<p><pre><code>  At multiple employers, having spent 6-8 figures on Oracle\n  database or enterprise business applications, we used to\n  get things like critical security updates delivered as a\n  ZIP file with instructions for where to copy files and\n  what permissions to set them. Sure, it&#x27;s not that hard to\n  roll a pkg, rpm, etc. but why should every customer need\n  to do that?\n</code></pre>\nI completely agree that there should be a better update system; Sun was already working towards a better one which was first introduced in Solaris 11: The Image Packaging System.  It was a new packaging system intended to simplify software updates for all of Sun&#x27;s Solaris customers.  The Glassfish team also chose to leverage for their product, distributing updates for Glassfish on Solaris, Windows, Linux and even Mac OS X via IPS.<p><pre><code>  Sun wasn&#x27;t ... it took 20 minutes to have the systems in\n  production running Debian Linux and we spent less time on\n  OS support over the life of hardware than trying to get a\n  core feature to work once.\n</code></pre>\nI sympathise, but again, this is why a completely new packaging and installation system was introduced in Solaris 11; to avoid problems like that.  It helps ensure administrators have easy access to updates and always performs OS updates in a way that can be easily reverted if there&#x27;s a problem.<p>If that&#x27;s even mildly interesting to you, there&#x27;s a website where both the FOSS source code for the new packaging system and the reasoning behind it is available:<p><a href=""https://java.net/projects/ips/pages/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://java.net/projects/ips/pages/Home</a><p>The &quot;Background Reading&quot; section on that page has several helpful links that talk about the reasoning and philosophy behind it.<p>Solaris 11+ has a great update story compared to pretty much any UNIX-like system out there today.  To update to the next release of the operating system, it&#x27;s generally as simple as:<p><pre><code>  pkg update\n</code></pre>\nNow behind that simple command lies an entire set of processes that happen each time it is executed:<p>1) newest &quot;package catalog&quot; is retrieved from the configured package repositories (local and/or remote)<p>2) determines which packages are installed, and what all of the newer versions of those packages are<p>3) parses dependencies of all packages involved to establish the transitive closure of the dependency graph<p>4) transforms dependencies into a set of boolean statements that can be evaluated by minisat, the boolean satisfiability solver that&#x27;s used<p>5) takes the solution (if one is available) provided by the solver and then maps that to the equivalent set of packages<p>6) retrieves package manifests for all packages that will be upgraded, added, or modified<p>7) determines differences between installed version and target version ensuring that only files that have changed between package versions are retrieved and only files that need to be updated, installed, or removed are modified<p>8) organises differences based on the order they need to be executed as a single set ignoring package boundaries, performing reference counting and conflict checking<p>9) retrieves only the files that will be upgraded or installed as part of the operation<p>10) determines if the operation can be safely performed on the live system, if it cannot, it will create a snapshot of the root filesystem and clone it, otherwise, it will take a snapshot of the filesystem as a precaution before execution<p>11) executes planned operation, executes commands that prepare new boot environment for use, etc.<p>12) if operation succeeds, new boot environment (if applicable) is activated<p>Or put more simply, when you execute &#x27;pkg update&#x27; on Solaris 11+, generally only a copy of the system is updated.  So if the update fails, you can just pick an older boot environment from the GRUB2 menu and be right back to a working system in moments.<p>The other big difference from all of this, as an example, is that the package system is capable of upgrading from any older version of Solaris to any newer version of Solaris.<p>There are no patch readmes or zip files; administrators just update from one version to the next -- the system figures out the rest.  It even knows when upgrades require a firmware update.",1403395969

For examples, laws like Sarbanes-Oxley. These are laws under which the government initiates force against market participants to try to force a desired outcome.<p>Proper laws merely <i>protect</i> individual sovereignty. For example, you can&#x27;t use force against someone, whether physically or through possessing something that violates a contract with them (which is fraud). Only the government can use force, and only in retaliation to protect sovereignty.<p>The ethical basis for this distinction is that it is in everyone&#x27;e self-interest to be protected from the initiaion of force in general, while it is against everyone&#x27;s self-interest to be vulnerable to the initiaition of force, in general.

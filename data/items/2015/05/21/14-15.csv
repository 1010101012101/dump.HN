Reads are plenty fast, it&#x27;s writes that are a problem. Certainly, it is a pathological problem with the disk subsystem that makes it suck, but it does suck, and if I could flip a switch and say &quot;stop waiting for the disk, write it whenever you can&quot; without risking breaking consistency on crashes, I would do so.<p>It seems like, from another comment, that setting innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit to a non-1 value is roughly what I want, though it still flushes every second, which is probably more often than I need, but may resolve the problem of the application waiting for the commit to disk, which is probably enough.",1432220397

I wish people in America would be taught this, I&#x27;m amazed at how often light traffic I encounter is from a few people meandering in the left most lanes and then everyone behind just matching their speed. Obviously does nothing about major traffic but still annoying. Besides that, people need to stop thinking of driving as a competition and let others change lanes and merge. I&#x27;d like to think those 2 things would help the situation a bit.",1432220368
9583141,comment,9582078,9582929,0,0,moron4hire,,,">> I don&#x27;t know about economy and such, maybe it really is beneficial for most people in the economy to borrow money and live way above their current means, but on a personal level taking on a debt looks like an economic suicide.<p>If your view of a healthy economy is one that siphons money out of the working class and into the coffers of large corporations in an ever growing spiral of consumption, then yes, taking on debt &quot;makes sense&quot;. If the amount of money being spent and the market capitalization of your largest firms are the only way a country knows how to measure its wealth, then it will clearly prioritize spending over all else.<p>Personally, I think a healthy economy is one that meets the needs of its citizens. Why should 150 million people be &quot;stimulated&quot; and &quot;incentivized&quot; to spend money they don&#x27;t have to make sure they all have new iPhones so Apple gets richer? Wouldn&#x27;t it be better for those people to save their money and spend it on things that are actually important to them? Half those people spending half that money in their home towns probably goes a lot further.<p>I was poor too, when I was a kid and entering my career. I fix stuff around my house, too. Why am I going to spend $1000 on a new TV when it&#x27;s a $2 capacitor that is the problem? Maybe that&#x27;s what it is. We don&#x27;t trust a system that wasn&#x27;t there for us. The modern era of data-fueled, giganto-corp protectionist capitalism is all about making sure the richest get their due before the rest of us.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I believe in capitalism. It&#x27;s how small businesses work. I&#x27;d much rather give my money to a local shop ran by people in my own community, people I know, friends even. I know I&#x27;m helping them out, they know they&#x27;re helping me out. That&#x27;s healthy.",1432220364

9583117,comment,9580547,9581453,0,0,bryondowd,,,"I would think that active coordination could be beneficial, when not guaranteed. I&#x27;m sure most people have been in a situation where they are waving or gesturing with another driver to coordinate something in a friendly way. Maybe you need to move into their lane, so you point and make a questioning face. They nod as if they understand and make room for you. You move over.<p>They didn&#x27;t need to back off, and in that case, you would have just waited for an opportunity to open up, or a friendlier driver to be next to you. Even if they nodded, but didn&#x27;t back off, you&#x27;d just assume a mis-communication and not try to merge in.<p>So, self driving cars could do this on a much more regular and reliable basis, while still not relying on it or trusting one another. They broadcast that they want to get over, and if another car happens to get that signal and happens to be willing/able to comply, it opens a space. If the first car sees a space, it moves over, which is what it would have done anyway, regardless of whether the space is coincidental or intentional.<p>Could also be handy for determining right of way in edge cases where humans often get confused and play the you-go-no-I-guess-I&#x27;ll-go-no-wait-now-he&#x27;s-going game. Two computers might be playing the same game, but they can resolve it in a tiny fraction of a second. Of course, the flocking birds example works well here as well. If the rules are clear enough, the cars will just know who should go.<p>But yes, no matter what, a car couldn&#x27;t trust what another will do, and should be prepared with an evasion strategy for every possibility, thus not doing anything that would leave it no way out if another car did something stupid or there was a mis-communication.",1432220189

So the total price is $28k.<p>Yes, and the sentence you quoted specifically said the $98,000 figure was using <i>Tesla&#x27;s</i> batteries.<p>> 62 kwh is over two full day&#x27;s worth of electricity usage for the average US home. I actually think that&#x27;s probably quite a bit more than you need. Two of Elon&#x27;s batteries is 20kwh, which is about 2/3 of an average day&#x27;s usage - enough to last most people the night, right?<p>Wrong.  An off-grid PV system requires a buffer to supply power during days with little to no sun.  Two days is about right for most of the country; in some places I would size it larger because they are prone to multiple days of overcast conditions at certain times of year.<p>Furthermore, you completely ignored that I stated, supported by the link I provided to the Tesla page, that you are not supposed to use the 10kWh batteries for daily drain applications.<p>> $98k was in California right? According to this, Los Angeles gets 5.62. Manhattan gets 4.57.<p>I didn&#x27;t look into where the $98,000 was supposed to be located.  I assumed they took the least-favorable location in the country.<p>> Why not pick 3.9 and assume that everybody gets as much as Fairbanks, Alaska?<p>Because the vast majority of the US gets in the range of 4.2 - 4.5?  I could have used 4.5, but that would only move the total cost down by about $4,000.  Still, that is the average.  An off-grid system needs to be designed for the low on that chart, or there will be times of year you have little or no power.",1432219853

We do make quite a lot more than most people in the country, say nothing about the world, and we spend it <i>all</i> (in different ways, including on our retirement), but how we spend it is important.<p>If you want to have a fun lifestyle, you have to cut your living expenses. Housing is pretty much everyone&#x27;s biggest expense, which is silly because houses aren&#x27;t &quot;fun&quot;. I don&#x27;t know anyone who has parties often enough to justify large living spaces. I do really like hosting parties, but I can do that in a park or a private room in a restaurant more easily than at home, and it&#x27;s a hell of a lot cheaper than keeping a large dining room and living room all the time.<p>I also think of it as being brutally honest and pragmatic with yourself. You have to decide for yourself how you will live your life and not let other people&#x27;s expectations decide for you. Want to be a literal rockstar? You can do it if you give up on the same sort of vacations your coworkers are taking. Don&#x27;t want to give up on vacations? Admit to yourself you like vacations more than being a rockstar and give up on spending money on being a rockstar.<p>I think a lot of people distract themselves with spending money on things that they think they are supposed to want, but ultimately aren&#x27;t actually what they want. For example, despite what they might say out loud, a lot of people really just want to sit at home and watch TV. That&#x27;s absolutely fine. Just admit it to yourself and stop spending money on fishing equipment that you never use. Then you&#x27;d be able to sink the money into a massive home theater system instead, something you&#x27;d actually get to enjoy on a regular basis.<p>If you try to do both, you&#x27;ll end up in over your head in debt and not getting to fish <i>or</i> have a big home theater.<p>We have friends who are trying to &quot;do both&quot; on travel and a large house.

We didn&#x27;t have quite as many people, but I think that also made for a better party. They don&#x27;t make any more than we do, they are constantly in debt, it&#x27;s ruining their marriage, and now she just got pregnant so their income is about to get cut in half. He just took a job he hates because they will need the money.<p>If my wife gets pregnant, our options will be to... stop booking international flights. And that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re planning on. We&#x27;re actively planning on shifting how we enjoy ourselves to accommodate our means. Luckily, we both really like board games. I&#x27;ve personally put off playing games over the last few years so I could focus on travel, get the most out of it, then switch to gaming together when we settle down.<p>Whatever it is you do, do it completely.

Sometimes you don&#x27;t realize any savings from a move for many months or in some cases, years... and if you&#x27;re unlucky, you don&#x27;t realize any savings at all and in fact, hidden costs that you hadn&#x27;t accounted for can end up costing you money or sinking you into a hole. So moving can also be a risk, sometimes, it&#x27;s better the devil you know than the devil you don&#x27;t.<p>Moving cheaply requires good timing, a handy amount of free labour (i.e. friends that own trucks and owe you favours or like you enough to help just out of the goodness of their own hearts), a little good luck, a keen eye on available real estate and good negotiation skills.

9583019,comment,9581572,9582682,0,0,oggy,,,"But the black magic lies exactly in the handshake. You need to generate the RSA key (or more broadly, an asymmetric key) in order for the handshake to take place.<p>An analogy I like to use are boxes with locks. Imagine that, given a lock design, I can produce a bunch of boxes with the exact copies of the lock and keys for the lock. Symmetric crypto corresponds to everyday locks: if you have the key for the lock, you can open or close the lock as you wish. Asymmetric crypto corresponds to a special kind of lock, which comes with two keys: one kind for locking the lock (the public keys), another for unlocking (the private keys).<p>Now if somebody wants to communicate with me securely, the choice of lock affects the key distribution significantly. If I have just symmetric locks, for each person I want to talk to, I have to create a new box with a separate lock, and make sure they are the only ones having a key for this lock. The latter I have to in person. Meaning, if I want to talk to somebody on the Internet, I first have to meet them in person (that is, out of band), before we can communicate securely. This doesn&#x27;t scale well. With asymmetric crypto, however, I can just leave a bunch of open boxes and corresponding locking (public) keys lying around (the keys for the different boxes can be same or different, doesn&#x27;t matter). If Assange now wants to send me a message, he writes it on a piece of paper, puts it in one of the open boxes, and locks it with the locking key. I&#x27;m the only person with the unlocking (private) key for this lock so I&#x27;m the only one who can read the message. This is just basic asymmetric crypto.<p>Another thing Assange could do is, instead of leaving a piece of paper with the message, to leave a piece of paper with a fresh design of a symmetric lock. Now I can safely create my own symmetric box according to the design, put messages inside, lock them and leave them around for Assange to pick up. This is secure since he&#x27;s created the design and he&#x27;s the only one apart from me who can open such boxes.<p>This is a 10,000 foot view of how to do the switch from asymmetric to symmetric crypto, but there are many other questions that need to be addressed to get an actual protocol. Thes include &quot;how does Assange know this public key belongs to me&quot; (answer: certificates and certificate authorities), &quot;how do I know the message came from Assange&quot; (answer: digital signatures), &quot;what purpose does this message serve&quot; (tagging and nonces), &quot;what kind of designs I can produce locks for&quot; (ciphersuite negotiation) and so on. Additionally, there&#x27;s all kinds of things that can go wrong when implementing this - basically, even though we know how to check the security of a high-level design of a protocol using formal methods (the so-called &quot;symbolic verification&quot; tools), we don&#x27;t really have a systematic way of translating these designs into actual implementations while preserving the security guarantees.<p>Also, there are direct key-exchange protocols (such as Diffie-Hellman) which work differently than the basic idea above.",1432219343

Smart encoding of the data and a clever search strategy allowed the identification of &#x27;candidate&#x27; records for matches with fairly high accuracy, fetching the few records that matched and checking if they really were matches sped things up two orders of magnitude over their SQL based solution.<p>Right. But you&#x27;ve still not made a compelling argument that the &quot;smart encoding of the data&quot; and &quot;clever search strategy&quot; couldn&#x27;t be done with/in SQL. I&#x27;m quite sure you could probably get a magnitude or two of improvement by diving down outside of SQL -- but there&#x27;s a big difference between using the schema you have, and setting up a dedicated system.<p>I was perhaps not clear, but I was wondering if it&#x27;s not often the case with real-world data, that you could create a new, tailored schema in SQL, and do the analysis on one system -- especially if you allow for something like advanced stored procedures (perhaps in C) and alternate storage engines.<p>I suppose one could argue when something stops <i>being</i> SQL, and start becomming SQL-<i>like</i>. But the initial statement was that &quot;For some problems SQL would already be way too much overhead.&quot;. The implication being (as I understood it, at least) -- that you not only have to change how the date is stored and queried, but that SQL databases are unsuitable to that that task -- and that by going away from your dbs, you can suddenly do something that you <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> do on a system with X resources.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s wrong -- I&#x27;m just asking if a) that&#x27;s what you mean, and b) if you can quantify this overhead a bit more. Are using bitfields or whatnot with postgres going to be a 20% overhead, or a 20000% overhead in your scenario?

I told myself long ago that if any of my little side-projects takes off, I&#x27;d make a real effort to implement the 6 hour workday.  So far, no luck, but I feel its feasible.

I&#x27;m 29.<p>There are a couple of things I would like to build (scholar notes manager, complex Hebrew typesetting software with an extensive critical apparatus support, a space flight simulator education game for teaching math) but I cannot decide what tools should I use for that purpose. Again - I am not doing this for money, nor as a business, and my main focus right now is academic and completely outside of IT.<p>I have a strong self-thaught foundation in JAVA, MySQL, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of C++ and Python (I have not build anything useful yet, just bits and pieces for fun, at most 200 lines of code). I know nothing about algorithms except for a couple of cooking recepies and nothing about design patterns except that they exist.<p>It&#x27;s high time to start these 3 projects I mentioned above. But when I did the first version of the scholar notes manager in PHP, I was ridiculed by my brother and some other friends when I shared this idea, because PHP, as they argued, is an embarrasingly outdated technology of the previous decade. So I swiched to JAVA, hoping that it will be a more universal, portable, enerprise backed (and therefore long lasting?) tool, that would also be a better ornament to my CV than just PHP and HTML. So I&#x27;ve spent the last 5 months going through an old Head First book, learning SWING, which also appeared to be obsolete.<p>Please help me decide - should I abandon these languages and swich to Python+Qt? I don&#x27;t mind that (I love to learn), but it again means postponing the actual production by at least 6 months.

He answered without a shred of hesitation that such people should borrow money from somewhere, effectively becoming indebted to some bank for the rest of their lives.<p>It&#x27;s a very common mindset, people are being trained to believe that living with a huge debt is a perfectly normal thing. It isn&#x27;t. Just as you say all you need to do is to live within your means and rationalize your spendings a bit.

Instead of borrowing money I&#x27;ve learned to live making around $200 a month. That&#x27;s of course another country, another currency and another economy, but to put things in perspective: that&#x27;s less than one tenth of average income here. I learned to fix things that broke, learned to make things of my own, learned to recognize when something is worth its price and when it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m almost 30 now; I earn twice the average salary now, but I still make (some) furniture of my own, I still repair things around the house myself and I still don&#x27;t buy the most expensive things &quot;just because&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know about economy and such, maybe it really is beneficial for most people in the economy to borrow money and live way above their current means, but on a personal level taking on a debt looks like an economic suicide.",1432218576

That drops most of the US to 2.8.  That means the median house would need twice the number of solar panels in that set to cover all times of year.<p>Combined with the actual cost of Powerwall batteries, we are at $67,344.

(You can&#x27;t drive 80 miles per hour bumper-to-bumper.)  So if density is say, 50% (one carlength of open space per one car), you have to drive a speed such that a carlength is 1-2s, in other words 10-20mph.<p>But traffic distribution is not uniform, there&#x27;s exits and entrances, and cars do occasionally need to change lanes.  If traffic is going 10-20mph with 1 carlength of space between cars (steady state), and I change lanes, the guy I merged in front of now has to slow down more to leave more room, and this <i>will</i> cause a traffic wave behind him.  What happens at an exit when half the cars change lanes?  Standstill.  No change in driving technique on anyone&#x27;s part will help this.<p>I think the only times where the way you drive matters is when the density is kinda sorta high but still low enough for a safe following distance at reasonable speeds, at which point &quot;smoothing out waves&quot; becomes a common sense matter of &quot;don&#x27;t follow so close&quot;, which is effectively the same thing, and something everyone should be doing anyway when the density is low.",1432218287

As you can see, only Compressed Air is competitive with Pumped Hydro as far as energy storage (w-hrs).<p>It looks like Compressed Air is going to be the golden standard a few years from now. There was a relatively cheap compressed-air plant created out of abandoned mine tunnels that was hundreds-of-Megawatts in scale.

So California&#x27;s low-water situation may prefer compressed air storage systems.<p>Redox Flow batteries look to be the most promising technology at utility-scale chemical. Chemical solutions are needed for their versatility... but &quot;long-term&quot; energy storage (such as day-night load balancing) will likely be handled by Compressed Air and/or Pumped Hydro.<p>Currently, over 95% of the US&#x27;s energy storage capacity is in pumped hydro.",1432217650

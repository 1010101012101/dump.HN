9199991,comment,9198092,9198092,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Lucene is quite fantastic and Elasticsearch makes it a joy to use.<p>Still, I wonder what the overhead of Java is adding in this case. Even minor things like integer decoding can be done very fast with SIMD... but such approaches don&#x27;t seem amenable to Java. I see that Elasticsearch exposes quite a bit of GC metrics, which must be a problem at times. And one of the Lucene devs wrote a post on how he replaced some parts with C++ and saw massive gains (but with a disclaimer that this was in no way indicative that Java wasn&#x27;t fast).<p>I&#x27;ve considered trying to implement something like Lucene in, say, Rust, but then I see just how utterly massive Lucene is. Just the fuzzy search part alone required implementing code to generate code from a Russian PhD thesis they didn&#x27;t fully understand.[1] So, no matter how many cycles the JVM is needlessly burning, Lucene just seems to advanced to write it without the overhead. (And maybe my intuition is just wrong and the overhead is only a few percent.)<p>1: <a href=""http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/03/lucenes-fuzzyquery-is-100-times-faster.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/03/lucenes-fuzzyquery-is...</a>",1426280261

GPS drift would make it impossible to tell if someone is moving in their house (Normally looking at GPS points shows a clustering around the house and sometimes as far as a 50+ meters outside their house.<p>As to those asking how he got it off, the article says it was &quot;sliced&quot; off so my guess is he cut the strap (then lied about the fall) which cut the fiber optic cable in the bracelet, he then reattached the fiber optic cable and taped it up. The police SHOULD have been sent as soon as they got a strap tamper alert but it appears they believed the fall story. Note most of the time police don&#x27;t talk to the participants when this happens, rather a monitoring company staffs a call center then send recording of the call and notes to the user&#x27;s supervisor who then can choose to alert the police. Apparently there is another way to get these off if the bracelet is loose enough that involves a plastic bag and sliding it off (a co-worker mentioned a video going around of it but I&#x27;ve never seen it) but due to the fact this article mentions they were alerted to it being tampered with I doubt that is the case.",1426280161

9199973,comment,9197873,9199837,0,0,Ovid,,,"This is correct. I was doing well in my career before the book, but it really took off after the book. However, I was already co-author of one book before that, and I blog prolifically, so that skews this.<p>The way it works is simple. Publishers hope to sell about 5,000 or so copies of your typical tech book. That&#x27;s enough to keep the publisher going, but not enough to really make money for them. The publisher keeps those &quot;filler&quot; books going to keep up street cred and hopes to sometimes land the &quot;killer&quot; book that makes them a nice profit.<p>I can&#x27;t share the sales info for my book, but let&#x27;s just say that I think the book is doing better than one might expect for its category.<p>If you want to write a tech book, you want to go with O&#x27;Reillly. My advance was much larger than what O&#x27;Reilly would offer, but they sell more tech books in the long run. However, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Perl book section is saturated and they generally don&#x27;t take new authors.<p>What I did to reposition my book was a strategy I wish more tech books would take: I focused on jobs. Instead of teaching every esoteric niche of a language (though I covered it well), I focused very heavily on skills that employers look for. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a long, long time and am very familiar with employer needs, so I was well-positioned to do this. That has led to my book doing better than expected: here&#x27;s what you need for a job!<p>I now have a successful Perl consulting firm (<a href=""http://www.allaroundtheworld.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allaroundtheworld.fr/</a>) and that book, while I can&#x27;t prove it helped, definitely didn&#x27;t hurt.<p>Oh, and my publisher has spoken to an Amazon rep and a contact I have in Amazon tells me that they&#x27;re aware of the situation and are looking into it.

9199965,comment,9199500,9199500,0,0,russnewcomer,,,"In episode 60 [1] of the great (and sadly, ending soon) podcast Pragmatic, John Chidgey talks some about the history of programming and more specifically some about Turing, arguing that Turing is overrated.  I largely agree, and since I send John feedback after every episode, I sent him a longish rant, reproduced as follows:<p>When talking about the history of programming, there&#x27;s always a difficulty because of the difference between computing and programming.  It&#x27;s nearly undeniable, for example, that Vannevar Bush had a greater impact on computing than did John Von Neumann (I&#x27;ll take the haters on with that).  As We May Think is more important than Von Neumann&#x27;s draft, because what Von Neumann was talking about had already been created and codified, whereas As We May Think was much more of a visionary work.  Maybe put another way, I think Von Neumann was a brilliant synthesist, bringing together the ideas of many into the next step in the evolution of whatever he was working on at the time.  Bush, on the other hand, was a management/strategic level thinker who saw the revolutionary step ahead of whatever he was working on.  But, Bush was not a programmer in any way, and his impact on programming is limited.  Similarly, I think that Turing is overly lionized for his programming contributions because of the Turing test and Eliza.  He provided a lot of the theoretical underpinnings, but I would argue that C.A.R. Hoare&#x27;s contributions have a greater reaching practical impact than did Turing&#x27;s.  I suspect that Turing and Von Neumann had political connections in the ACM and IEEE that led to their improved historical standing. But as always, historical/political credit is almost as much a function of who you know/where you are as what you&#x27;ve done.  (I&#x27;m a huge fan of Shannon, Mauchly, Adm. Hopper, Hoare, and Dijkstra, over others like Turing and Von Neumann).<p>It&#x27;s also very difficult, when just surveying computer history, to give proper credit to Zuse, Lebedev, Scherbius, Rejewski, etc, due to the lack of English Language resources on their accomplishments, and lingering bias against the governments some of them worked for.  One could make a very compelling argument for Scherbius as having created _the_ most pivotal invention of the twentieth century, because Enigma drove the large investment into cryptanalysis, which led to the large investment in devices that eventually became the general purpose computing machines of today.<p>There&#x27;s also a large, long discussion to be had about the impact of figures like Marvin Minsky, Bill Gosper, Richard Greenblatt, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, Brendan Eich, Donald Knuth, Peter Norvig, or Alan Kay had on programming, and also on the impact figures like Jack Goldman, Doug Engelbart, Steve Wozniak, Thomas Watson, Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, David Packard, Bill Hewlett, Steve Jobs, Nolan Bushnell, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, Vint Cerf, or Jim Clark had on computing.  Few of those guys cross over from programming to computing or vice versa, yet each have critical contributions to be discussed and looked at.  I don&#x27;t know of a lot of good books or resources, though, that really tackle this.  Steven Levy&#x27;s Hackers is the canonical example, but it is heavily biased toward the AI Lab crowds, Lisp hackers, and the early Unix pioneers, without touching on the big industry/engineer types more than tangentially or even scornfully, and almost completely ignored the military/NASA.  I also really appreciated Peter Siebel&#x27;s Coders at Work, which was more inclusive but not really a history, more of a set of conversations.  I&#x27;m told Petzold&#x27;s CODE is good, and of course deeper into history there&#x27;s the Godel, Escher, Bach: the Eternal Golden Braid, which I have on my bookshelf and have to admit not getting to far into because I don&#x27;t really like math.  Either way, as I&#x27;m sure you know, there is a wide, wide history of programming and computing that could be explored more, and I find it a shame that no one has done so with the historical rigor that I would like.  (Such a book would probably be $100+ because sales would be so small since few people would be interested, and it would discourage others from taking up future projects)<p>[1] <a href=""http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/pragmatic/episode-60-or-was-that-doctor-sbaitso"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/pragmatic/episode-60-or-w...</a>",1426280006

Over the 21st century the countries that will contribute greatest to the cumulative greenhouse emissions over that period are those which are today in the &quot;developing&quot; world. CO2 emissions from Asia already vastly outstrip those from the USA, for example. If every single G7 country stopped producing CO2 completely tomorrow that would provide a comparatively minor change to the estimated total global CO2 emissions for the 21st century.<p>Many people believe as you do, that the problem is primarily with the rich, developed nations of the world, that they are big, ugly polluters who are making the world worse for all of the poor folks in the world and if they&#x27;d just accept a different scope for their lifestyle it would be possible to clean up this whole mess. That&#x27;s a gross misunderstanding of the issue. The crux of the problem is that over the next few decades literally billions of people will climb out of poverty as the developing world becomes developed, and they will do so largely via industry powered by fossil fuels. They will become healthier, more well-fed, more productive, and wealthier almost in lock-step with their increase in energy, energy produced at the cost of CO2 emissions. Make no mistake, there is a tremendous amount of good that will come of this, billions of lives will be vastly improved and there will be new opportunities for artistic expression and cultural exchange which have not existed yet. But currently we know of no way to enable that transition to the developed world without such a heavy reliance on fossil fuels.",1426279239

Often used for gaming in a group (like Teamspeak or Ventrilo).  It has the idea of channels (rooms, offices, etc) is very high quality, low latency and low bandwidth installed on your companies servers in minutes, always encrypted... and clients are available for linux, windows, os-x, android, ios, etc.<p>So you can have channels like &quot;Bob&#x27;s Office&quot;, &quot;Working on XYZ problem&quot;, etc.  People can come into these channels to speak to you and can leave them.  It feels a bit like an office environment, I can pop into Jay&#x27;s office, talk to him about an issue, and go back to my office.  I recommend people setup Push To Talk, which really helps create a silent non-annoying environment.  Basically, me and another developer can be working on an issue, but maybe not actively talking, but in the same channel -- and there is blissful silence... I don&#x27;t hear the fan, the cat, the fact that his wife came into talk to him for a minute, etc.<p>When I start my work-day -- I start it by logging into the mumble server (or more accurately, moving myself out the AFK channel) -- and when I end it, I move myself back into the AFK channel.  This is a realtime communication system, async work still happens... well, everywhere else.<p>It is easy to be on all day as an &quot;in-office&quot; experience... when I am eating lunch, I create a &quot;eating lunch&quot; channel under AFK and put myself there.... We find it works so much better than video chat (or really anything else), is far more casual (like an office) and far more fluid... it is like having an open door policy.  Sometimes I might be in a channel that says &quot;Debugging Race Issue Go Away&quot; -- but it technically doesn&#x27;t keep anyone out, it is a request.<p>Using mumble day to day basically changed the experience from mediocre to great for us.

There were co-workers who really <i>preferred</i> only ever working in the same location as the rest of their team, so we structured teams that met that preference.  There were other co-workers that were perfectly happy with completely remote work (in fact, I never met, face-to-face, three of my regular co-workers).<p>By and large, it really did boil down to preferences, although I did note that my co-workers that preferred in-person projects were the ones most likely to interrupt me - and be completely oblivious to the fact that they were interrupting me!

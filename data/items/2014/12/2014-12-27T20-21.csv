8803904,comment,8803118,8803503,0,0,Bud,,,"Most of the criticisms of brand-new OS updates being &quot;slow and bloated&quot; are from extremely impatient users (or professional clickbait critics) who don&#x27;t even have the good sense to wait a few hours or a day or two for the processes that can make major upgrades a bit sluggish on ALL devices to complete, such as rebuilding databases, the fact that OS updates often result in dozens or even hundreds of app updates that have to download and install and in some cases update their own databases, etc.<p>Certainly, they do not wait for the first x.0.1 release, or for the release that usually closely follows the initial release and which is specifically intended to optimize performance on the oldest devices that can still support the latest OS. This was seen for iOS 7 and once again for iOS 8.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a valid comment, or a comment made in good faith, to say that iOS updates are a &quot;bait and switch&quot;. That&#x27;s just silliness and flies in the face of all the facts. The facts say, very loudly, that Apple supports its older devices MUCH better and for much longer than any competitor. It&#x27;s not even close.<p>Now, if you are unable to acknowledge reality, and expect that a brand-new OS, designed to take advantage of devices that are about 10x as fast as three-year-old or four-year-old devices, isn&#x27;t going to be quite as snappy on older devices, then in my opinion, that is on you as a user. Blaming Apple for trying to give more features to users on new hardware is ludicrous. Apple expends considerable engineering effort keeping those devices working as well as possible. The iPhone has been out for seven years. There&#x27;s now more than enough history out there for users to know that if you install major iOS updates, you cannot easily downgrade. (It&#x27;s not impossible, it&#x27;s just a huge pain.)",1419713972

Since Moore&#x27;s Law has largely faded, and we now gain speed by putting more CPUs in each server (rather than having the individual CPUs be faster) concurrency is an increasingly unavoidable aspect of programming. Joe Armstrong (Erlang) and Rich Hickey (Clojure) have both spent an enormous amount of time thinking about how to support concurrency in a programming language. Armstrong talks about a paradigm that he calls &quot;Concurrency Oriented Programming&quot;. Armstrong&#x27;s thesis is surprisingly readable and I recommend it:<p><a href=""http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf</a><p>Rich Hickey&#x27;s video presentation &quot;The value of values&quot; is also a good overview of some concepts that are important to Functional Programming:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM</a>",1419713677

The following might be a helpful starting point regarding NFP:<p><i>Birth Control and NFP: What&#x27;s the Difference?</i><p><a href=""http://www.priestsforlife.org/library/4741-birth-control-and-nfp-whats-the-difference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.priestsforlife.org/library/4741-birth-control-and...</a><p>&quot;NFP is not just a &#x27;method&#x27; based on physiology. Rather, NFP is based on <i>virtue</i>. It is based on sexual self-control, which is necessary for a healthy marriage. There are times in any marriage when spouses have to put aside their desire for sex because of sickness, fatigue, travel, or other reasons. In a healthy marriage, love is shown in many ways, and not all these ways of showing love are physical. In fact, to refrain from sex when necessary is itself an act of love. Why? Because in effect the spouses then say to each other, &#x27;I did not marry you just for sexual pleasure. I married you because I love you. You are a person, not an object. When I have sex with you, it is because I freely choose to show you my love, not because I need to satisfy an urge.&#x27; Using NFP requires abstinence from intercourse during the fertile days if a pregnancy has to be avoided. This actually can strengthen the couple&#x27;s sexual life. When the spouses know that they can abstain for good reasons, they also come to trust each other more, and avoid the risk of treating each other primarily as objects of sexual pleasure rather than persons. Artificial birth control, on the other hand, gives free reign to the temptation to make pleasure the dominant element, rather than virtue. It encourages couples to think that sexual self-control is not necessary. It can encourage them to become slaves to pleasure.&quot;",1419713374

It doesn&#x27;t attempt to make harassment impossible or illegal. It&#x27;s a social strategy: you can choose to harass people online, or you can choose to be friends with the Tor developers, but you can&#x27;t do both.<p>For that matter, harassment is <i>also</i> a social strategy to discourage unwanted activity: you can choose to be a high-profile woman online, or you can choose not to have tons of strangers hate you, but you can&#x27;t do both. So if this Tor statement somehow <i>was</i> censorship, harassment would be censorship as well.<p>And so would lots of other things people do every day. We&#x27;re social animals; we do things to encourage or discourage social participation that we like or don&#x27;t like. If you have stinky shoes, we stand farther away. If you say shitty things to women, you can&#x27;t be friends with the Tor developers.

8803802,comment,8802454,8803081,0,0,ericssmith,,,"Yes. Continuing beyond monads to learn about category theory is mostly because it is interesting. It is definitely not a prerequisite.<p>The historical relationship is that Eugenio Moggi wrote a paper in 1988 &quot;Computational lambda-calculus and monads&quot; <a href=""http://bit.ly/1x9uUHQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1x9uUHQ</a> that used ideas from category theory to handle the semantics of programming language features. His problem was that the lambda calculus itself failed to adequately handle certain &quot;notions of computation&quot; such as side effects and non-determinism. This inadequacy goes way back to the origins of programming language semantics, starting with Peter Landin&#x27;s 1964 paper &quot;Mechanical evaluation of expressions&quot; <a href=""http://bit.ly/1rrBit3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1rrBit3</a>. He described a virtual machine (SECD) for evaluating lambda expressions, but had to add special constructs for handling assignment and jumps. In case you don&#x27;t know what semantics is about, imagine that you had two small programs written in two different languages. How would you determine if they were the same? One way would be to demonstrate their equivalence to a common, mathematically sound, language. That&#x27;s what Landin used the lambda calculus for. But it&#x27;s only good for a subset of what we understand computation to be (particalurly what a Von Neumann computer is capable of doing).<p>That&#x27;s what prompted Moggi to look to a more encompassing branch of mathematics -- category theory -- to describe semantics. In 1991, he wrote &quot;Notions of computation and monads&quot; <a href=""http://bit.ly/1viXT6z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1viXT6z</a>, which is much shorter and more accessible, but essentially the same as the previous paper. Philip Wadler, one of the original authors of Haskell and long-time functional programming researcher and educator, was inspired by Moggi&#x27;s work to write (several times) a tutorial showing how Moggi&#x27;s &quot;monads&quot; could be applied to the restrictions of functional purity. For example, to simulate the incrementing of a global variable representing a counter (of some operation), one could use a &quot;state&quot; monad.<p>The monad of Wadler (and Moggi) is really pretty simple. First, you need a way of representing one of these notions of computation. In a programming language, this is done with types. Or to be more precise, a &#x27;type constructor&#x27; since you will want the computation to be general. For instance, if your computation changes state (eg the counter above), you might want to construct a function type that given a value, takes a state (eg integer representing the counter variable) and returns a tuple consisting of the value and some new state. I should point out that my last sentence is what makes monads so confusing and challenging in languages other than Haskell. They don&#x27;t have a nice way to represent what I just said. To use Wadler&#x27;s notation:<p>type T x = S -> (x, S)<p>The second component of a monad is a function that takes a value and returns a &quot;computation&quot; (ie, the type described above). And the third component is a function that takes one of the computations and a function from a value to a computation and returns a computation. That&#x27;s a mouthful, and it requires the language to support polymorphic types and higher-order functions. If your language does not or doesn&#x27;t provide good syntax for them, then monads will be an elusive and difficult concept. But as you can see, a monad is just a pattern made up of these three things. That&#x27;s all ... almost.<p>Because of the relationship to category theory, a monad (consisting of the three components) must also obey certain rules for how these operations are expected to behave when combined in certain ways.<p>In fact, monads are pretty cumbersome to implement, especially when there isn&#x27;t good syntactical support in a language. But they provide a general solution to certain kinds of problems which is functional in nature.",1419712051

When, even with extreme repetition, you&#x27;re sending single digit kilobytes per second over the Internet, it&#x27;s unlikely that your stream itself is substantially contributing to congestion, unless you have some completely broken/saturated link that nobody wants to play on anyway.  (One might want to send enough bytes per frame that such a buffer would start to bump up against packet size limits, but 120 frames is ridiculous.  I&#x27;m not even sure where he got it from, since 60 * 5 seconds timeout = 300, not 120 - and you don&#x27;t really want to time out after 5 seconds, since transient total outages happen when accidentally going out of range of a Wi-Fi network or whatever.  Layer the opportunistic resending on top of a TCP-like slow resend mechanism for the worst case, and then there&#x27;s no point sending each packet more than a handful of times.)<p>I implemented opportunistic resending last year for netplay in a branch of the Dolphin emulator.  The target audience was a group of people playing a fighting game (Super Smash Bros.) at a semi-high level, so it was essential to keep latency to an absolute minimum.  Even a few frames of lag is enough to substantially impede high level play (might be mitigated by prediction/rewinding if I ever implement that, but since fighting games are based on very quickly responding to others&#x27; actions, there&#x27;s only so good it can get); the 100ms from the article, for example, would be totally unacceptable for anything serious.  Even if it were feasible to implement client-side smoothing in an emulator, it would still be much superior to actually get the real data in time.<p>The question is then whether packet loss is common/significant enough in practice that opportunistic resending&#x27;s effects are visible in any significant way.  For Dolphin, the main advantage of using UDP over TCP is actually NAT traversal, so there is no reason not to do it, but it would be nice to know whether it helped.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have data here: I didn&#x27;t include code to explicitly record packet loss statistics or anything, and I haven&#x27;t had the time to actually clean up the code enough to promote it to master, so there aren&#x27;t many people using it anymore.  Anecdotally I implemented opportunistic resending, there was feedback that it was a noticeable improvement; there would certainly be some confirmation bias in there, but the feedback was positive enough to convince me it was likely a real effect.  They didn&#x27;t necessarily have to be losing a lot of packets; as the article mentions, with TCP a single packet lost makes you wait something like 2*RTT, which is certainly noticeable if your input buffer is set to the lowest possible value that produces smooth play under normal conditions.",1419711865

Maintain a list of tasks you can work on, and make it good enough that you can blindly pick one up and start working after a switch.<p>. Saving context via documentation/text/workspaces as japhyr mentioned helps me a lot. Whenever i come across an issue that i cant handle at that time, i throw it in a text file. At the end of a session, i organize the list. When i come back to task X, i just look at the list and start working on it. Just going through the list, seeing what I did and what remains is the fastest way ive found to warm up and get back in the flow of a project.<p>. Optimize your workflow. With a tiny chunk of time like this, 5 minutes setting up a workspace or even re-reading an article is too much.

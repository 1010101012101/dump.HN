In mose cases, we're able to get 1K+ Tumblr followers in < 3 months (not counting ""regular"" RSS subscribers). (And none of the projects are famous/have famous founders/services/products) To get the same amount of regular RSS subscribers is much more difficult.<p>Tumblr is comparable to Twitter in that it's a common <i>place</i> to meet your readers/customers. Unlike a self-hosted blog, you don't have to ask visitors to leave where they are to visit you. So you're likely to get a bit more foot traffic/interaction, not to mention people passing it on/sharing it out (via reblogs).<p>Now if you're an already established service/otherwise famous, you might have no problem getting people to check you out. But even then, Tumblr has its benefits.<p>I don't think the choice is necessarily all or nothing between self-hosted or Tumblr. Many companies with ""real"" blogs also have Tumblrs. In many cases companies have <i>multiple</i> Tumblrs. (Not unlike Twitter, it's becoming common to have a separate Tumblr for different events/products/branches/divisions. IBM has at least 3. NBC has at least 4...)<p>I won't disagree that Tumblr has horrible performance issues. But it's still worth it. Twitter 3 years ago had bad performance issues, but it was/is still definitely investing in. No social site is forever, but they're great tools as long as you're aware of costs + benefits.",1326686399

If it goes down for 1 minute each day, that may be more acceptable compared to '100%' uptime except one day when it goes out for 365 minutes.<p>All of that affects the impact that the downtime has on your  venture - it's quite possible you might have 'poor' uptime stats, but it has zero effect on your business, in which case the cost/effort savings from using a 'poorer uptime' hosted service may be worth it.",1326685531

Some of them have talked to a lot of people and they remember a lot.  One of the articles at Ars went over how Hollywood has predicted ""DOOM!"" for every new tech, including the copier & VCR.<p>The best serious scholarly legal works are by a guy named William Patry.  His books _Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars_ and _How to Fix Copyright_ are the two most relevant here, though it's quite a long read given that you have like 3 days.  You may or may not know that name, but he wrote a huge series on copyright law (_Patry on Copyright_) that lawyers use as a reference.  He also worked for Google, though he's sick of hearing crap about that.  He had exactly the same opinions about copyright law before & after being hired; namely, that they should promote progress.  Congress, meanwhile, cares more about money issues, as always.  Still, that's a point you probably do need to keep in mind when talking to them.<p>Hollywood is posting record profits, BTW.  I think TF had an article about that a month or so back.  Their numbers are all ass-pulls, not unlike their crazy accounting techniques.  Might be worth hitting them on their lack of math, because they've screwed more than a few artists that way.  Our problem isn't with the artists, it's with the industry.<p>Might also want to come up with some soundbites.

In a place like NYC, I can assure you that if your car is parked on, say, 74th & Lex, you're not going to get away with doing a car wash there.  Same goes for almost every commercial parking lot in the city -- they're not going to let a random guy come in and start washing cars (they don't let owners do that).<p>2)  As others have pointed out, there are environmental considerations here, not for tree-hugger reasons, but for legal ones.  Car washes are one of those things that many places are quite strict about technically, but when it's applied for personal use it's overlooked.  So in other words, Jonny Law isn't (necessarily) going to give you a ticket for washing your car in your driveway and not recycling the wastewater/solvents/etc., the situation becomes completely different when a commercial enterprise is involved.  Similar to my point above, you can bet your bottom dollar that NYPD is going to give any semi-commercial car washer a VERY hard time if he's found washing a car on any public street in Manhattan.  Likewise for the local PD of a smaller town if it's a guy washing cars in an office parking lot.<p>This may be the sort of business that works only in suburbia or places where a Cherry-supplied vendor is literally replacing a guy in his driveway - which, to end on a positive note, is most of the country.",1326683757

The inner-party elite of Oceania were barely middle-class by a material standard, and their society was falling further apart every year, but they held a lot of power. Materially, they weren't in an enviable position, any more than kings who died horribly of now-curable diseases are enviable, but the perverse and horrible (like O'Brien) could enjoy the shit out of their power and others' misery. The boot stomping on a face for a thousand years.<p>Most dictators enjoy their peoples' misery, and they get more out of the power than they would out of the 1-10x bump it would give their financial status (they have enough money, and unlimited means to get it) to be leading a healthy nation instead of a failing one. Kim Jong-il? While he was alive, I bet he was one of the happiest fuckers out there. And the U.S. corporatist-fascist oligarchy isn't morally superior in inclination; it's just that there are social structures (like laws and elections) in place retarding their progress.<p>Some people judge wealth and prosperity in absolute terms: what we can do, experiences we can have. That's how most of us on HN feel: it's a positive-sum, win-win mentality. But a lot of people see these things in purely relative terms: they <i>like</i> elitism and exclusion, and that others are suffering from bullshit they don't have to deal with. It makes sense when one considers that excessive financial ambitions are usually sexual in nature, and the sexual benefits derived from obscene wealth are based solely in relative social status (being ""alpha"").<p>The OP needs to be read by a lot of people (who probably won't read it): people who conflate $400k/year neurosurgeons who got ""rich"" and startup new-money by working their asses off (who are generally held to deserve their good fortune, and I agree) with an entrenched, culturally underaccomplished, fascistic, and depraved aristocracy of indolent, manipulative parasites that society should be getting rid of+ through whatever means necessary.<p>(+ To make it clear, I mean we need to get rid of <i>the aristocracy</i> as an institution, not ""get rid of"" the individual people. I'd find it quite morally acceptable to solve society's problems in a way that finds them bad, if they weren't willing to decline peacefully and gracefully, but I also think revenge is an utterly stupid impulse and find it most useful to not care either way what happens to them, as long as they're removed from power.)",1326683611

Registering hosting and/or domains is a trivial task.<p>Cotton's proposal that immunity was provided to Search Engines and Ad Networks is laughable. Here are the bill's actual claims:
<i>(A) IMMUNITY FROM SUIT- Other than in an action pursuant to paragraph (4), no cause of action shall lie in any Federal or State court or administrative agency against any entity served with a copy of a court order issued under this subsection, or against any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof, for any act reasonably designed to comply with this subsection or reasonably arising from such order.
(B) IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY- Other than in an action pursuant to paragraph (4)--</i><p>It promises immunity... Except for repercussions due to not correctly acting on the courts orders in a timely manner. So not only is there no real immunity, but there's a burden placed on businesses to immediately comply or 'else'.<p>Moreover, imagine that later down the road you were unlucky enough to purchase one of the domains that had been blacklisted. In order to be listed in a search index, receieve advertising revenue or conduct payments, you would need to file a motion with the court to lift the ban. An innocent person, who has never been found guilty of doing any harm, would be required to jump through legal hurdles in order to exist on the internet.<p><i>(d) Modification or Vacation of Orders-
(1) IN GENERAL- At any time after the issuance of an order under subsection (b), a motion to modify, suspend, or vacate the order may be filed by--
(A) any person, or owner or operator of property, that is subject to the order;
(B) any registrant of the domain name, or the owner or operator, of the Internet site that is subject to the order;
(C) any domain name registrar, registry, or other domain name registration authority that has registered or assigned the domain name of the Internet site that is subject to the order; or
(D) any entity that has been served with a copy of an order pursuant to subsection (c) that requires such entity to take action prescribed in that subsection.
(2) RELIEF- Relief under this subsection shall be proper if the court finds that--
(A) the foreign Internet site subject to the order is no longer, or never was, a foreign infringing site; or
(B) the interests of justice otherwise require that the order be modified, suspended, or vacated.</i><p>----<p>I'm going to continue paging through the bill, but I think this response is adequate to rebuke Cotton's assertion that this only effects ""wholesale piracy websites outside of the USA"". None of the parties I mentioned above were pirates, nor were they necessarily foreign entities.",1326683193

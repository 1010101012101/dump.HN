2895504,comment,2894953,2895380,2,0,retube,,,"Depends what you mean by ""profits are great"". When Goldman or Lloyds report profits of $10bn they get slated for massive profiteering. But a profit figure alone is meaningless. The number you're after is profit divided by market cap. Investors want a return on their shareholding: they want dividends. If a company has a market cap of $200bn a $10bn profit is 5% return. And not all that will be paid as dividends, much WILL be re-invested. So maybe the investor earns a return of just 2%. And if investors don't make a return, they'll bail out. Stock will fall, the bank will suffer, jobs will be lost. So it's important a bank does make these ""big"" profits.<p>It's all very well to wring your hands and demand investment in an area that you think is worthwhile, but that profit has got to feed a lot of mouths. Relatively speaking the profits are NOT that big. Perhaps bank leaders _are_ being short-sighted about this, but it's a whole lot more complex than bankers filling their pockets to get rich in the short term.<p>And from personal experience I can assure you one thing: they will invest wherever they think they'll get the best return. Perhaps that isn't aging IT systems.",1313592588

2895502,comment,2894593,2895293,4,0,briggsbio,,,"First, I think this is a closed view of the issue.  Second, I think publication bias has more effect on basic research and translational research (read: early animal pharmacology studies) than drug development.<p>Conduct of a clinical trial for the purposes of establishing the safety and efficacy of a drug product intended for a specific clinical indication has the goal of registration (NDA, BLA, PMA, 510(k)) of the drug so that the drug can be marketed and sold. Publications are great, and are a component of that, but not the primary goal.<p>To conduct a clinical study, the company must present all preclinical (FDA calls it nonclinical) pharmacology and toxicology on the drug product to determine whether the product is safe for testing in human trials. This is done via an investigational new drug application (IND, big damn documents that take months to prepare).  But I digress...<p>To conduct a clinical study, the protocol has to be submitted and FDA given time to comment (and they will, often and without much room to argue).  That means the patient population, randomization scheme, endpoints, power analysis, etc. are vetted by FDA pretty thoroughly. Next, the same process occurs for the study at local or national (central) institutional review boards (IRBs).  They get really nitpicky (especially local university IRBs for numerous reasons).  Their primary goal is to ensure the safety of patients, but they won't hesitate to comment on the design of the study in most cases.  And (not sure exactly when it became a requirement) sponsors have to register their clinical trial with a national registry (which you can search on clinicaltrials.gov).  The results of those studies MUST be submitted to the FDA under the IND, to the IRB, and updated in the registry, or development stops and the IND cancelled.<p>So unless I misunderstand your comment, the publication practices of journals affects the validity and thoroughness of clinical trial data. This is not the case.  Publication bias may alter the available literature, but drugs are NOT registered on publications and effected by ""pre-registration."" Drugs are developed and brought to market through a seriously controlled and monitored process, not at the whim of medical journals.  Now, preclinical data, basic science, ""academic studies"" not moving a drug toward registration, etc. are affected by publication bias.  It is a problem, and pre-registration is a complex issue but beneficial.<p>One final note:  Writing this comment made me think that an alternative form of pre-registration would be really interesting. But not to medical journals, but an open registry for ""coming soon research science."" Think of a registry of ""here's what we want to do"" for researchers in basic science, all putting up ideas (ones they are willing to do so openly) for preclinical or clinical studies on the site, indexed by keyword.  This would allow researchers to look online and not see what things HAVE been done, but see what things are GOING to be done.  This could help researchers identify colleagues (communicate via social features), collaborate on the research, and pool their funding efforts to get multi-institutional grants (usually higher dollar and currently a little less competitive and thus easier to get).  Put your research field and interest, and studies you would do ""if you had the money"" and then the registry would send you recommendations of people to connect with to try and move those research areas forward.  If this does not currently exist (which it does not, to my knowledge), it would be amazing to have.  It may also be an easier task to implement as a new feature of an existing research social network or community.  ""Enhancing serendipity in research..."" Interesting. Thoughts?",1313592565

Spacial navigation is pretty much dead between full screen apps and auto-rearranging of the spaces (well, you can turn that off I guess), so I decided to embrace Apple's new idea and see how it works.<p>First of all, I hated ExposÃ© and never used it.  Mission control actually is useful since I can see the apps and organize them quickly (much quicker than with SL Spaces in fact).  With the horizontal spaces, navigating them quickly is less confusing, and with auto-arranging spaces it makes switching back and forth between arbitrary spaces a lot easier, sort of like Command-Tabbing.<p>It's a huge change from Spaces, but for me (using 4-6 SL Spaces) never reached a level of perfection due to the small bugs and unpredictabilities in the system.

2895454,comment,2894919,2894919,2,0,dctoedt,,,"My guess is that this case is going to boil down to how the evidence gets authenticated in court.<p>1. Before trial, Ceglia's lawyer might file what's called a motion <i>in limine</i> (meaning ""at the threshhold""). The motion would be a request that the judge exclude the alleged smoking-gun contract document---which I'll call the SGC document---from being introduced into evidence at trial, that is, from being given to the jury or discussed in front of the jury.<p>The motion likely would argue that there had been no evidentiary showing that the SGC document was what Facebook claimed it was. Ceglia's attorney would almost certainly want to put on <i>evidence</i>---assuming he has any---that Facebook's attorneys planted the SGC document, as Ceglia claims. That's because the judge will almost surely dismiss Ceglia's claim about evidence-planting as being mere speculation, unless someone having first-hand knowledge were to testify to that effect, or unless there's documentary evidence to that effect. (And such documentary evidence would itself have to be authenticated; it's almost a recursion problem.)<p>2. Whether or not Ceglia's lawyer put on evidence that the SGC document was planted, it would then be up to Facebook's attorneys to offer evidence supporting the proposition that  yes, the SGC document is indeed what Facebook claims it is. They likely would do this through testimony about how they came to be in possession of the SGC document; this likely would include testimony from whoever examined the computer(s) where the SGC document was found.<p>Such evidence of authenticity wouldn't have to be iron-clad; it would only need to be enough that reasonable minds <i>could</i> agree with Facebook on that point.<p>3. The judge likely would rule before trial on Ceglia's motion <i>in limine</i>, that is on whether the jury would be allowed to see the SGC document.<p>If memory serves, such evidentiary rulings by a trial judge are usually reviewed by appellate courts under a very lenient standard, namely ""abuse of discretion.""  The theory is that trial judges have to be given some leeway to manage their cases.<p>I can easily imagine that the judge might punt: Instead of ruling on admissibility, the judge might have the jury decide whether the SGC document was authentic.<p>3. Depending on what Ceglia said under oath in court (in a sworn affidavit or in testimony), he might be in danger of perjury charges.",1313591620

First, lets face it, if they can program well in that language they can probably program well in any other higher level languages. Second, not very many people at all even know what a CPU's register is, or what the difference between big endian and little endian is, or why we should be really really happy that we were brought Protected Mode Flat Model. Meaning that if your one of those people that do bother to learn it then you'll have a much higher ""edge"" factor for any company willing to admit they need those skills around still. And finally, to see how bits turn to hexadecimal. How hexadecimal matches with CPU's registers and all you really do is move or push data from one piece of memory to another. It all gives you a perspective on how programs work underneath it all, how the operating system works, and lets you see things like the code beneath something in front of you. You get a good foundation of a core technology which may one day be needed again very badly. (Hasn't anyone figured out that quantum computers will need someone to create a new assembly language/architecture for that matter?)",1313590363

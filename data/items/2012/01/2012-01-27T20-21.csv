3520132,comment,3519952,3519952,29,0,tmhedberg,,,"The FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) [1] is the go-to reference for this sort of thing. It explains that `/bin` is for binaries that are essential before other file systems are mounted (e.g. in single user mode), and `/usr/bin` is for ""most user commands"" (all others). This allows you to keep a minimal local filesystem containing only the binaries needed for init to get the system running, and then `/usr` can be mounted, say, from a network share. This is useful because then network admins can install software to the common `/usr` share and make it immediately available to all machines which mount that share.<p>The `/sbin` and `/usr/sbin` directories are for commands needed only by administrators, which will not normally be used by regular users.<p>Most systems don't really require this separation, but it does make sense. Perhaps the historical reason for doing it is no longer a factor, but that doesn't mean it's perpetuated merely because of tradition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html</a>",1327697966

3520124,comment,3518384,3518720,2,0,SkyMarshal,,,"I appreciate the minimalist philosophy, and Arch is on my todo list (it's even got a vm allocated).  However, I seemed to have evolved into a more dual-pronged strategy - Full featured Ubuntu desktop, with relatively stripped down Ubuntu/Cent/OpenSUSE servers running in VMs.<p>For my desktop, I still value 'just works' over minimalism.  Things like Spotify just work out of the box.  And any software I may want to play with in the future that has to choose which distro to target will most likely target Ubuntu and Fedora first.<p>Also, the Debian repo is extensive, and the Ubuntu PPA system almost always compensates for when the Debian package is too outdated.<p>I also like where Ubuntu is going with the UI/UX.  At first I hated the idea of the sidebar, but after trying it and realizing it autohides and stays out of your way most of the time, I switched my opinion.  And I'm really looking forward to HUD in 12.04.  I've been wanting an integrated Gnome-Do/Synapse for a long time now.<p>Finally, I get my minimalism fix where it's most important - on the servers.  I can set up a local dev environment using vm's that mirrors production - database server on one vm, app server on another vm, and Nginx running on the desktop and pointing to the app server vm.<p>It does annoy me to start up htop on the desktop, and compare the plethora of stuff I see there with what htop on the servers displays.  But I just accept it for now.<p>Compared to that best-of-both-worlds setup, Arch seems like it would require more compromises than is worth the time and effort to deal with it.  I still intend to learn it, just because I value things that will help me learn Linux (or any of my primary tools) better.  But I don't see fully making the switch to Arch.<p>Thoughts?",1327697889

Do they make something like the ""average American sedan"" cited by Edwards?   No lie, you would kill Cars Kill Cities for me if you provided the following two examples:  1).  An ""average American sedan"" that somehow gets better city mpg than highway; and 2) the same ""average"" sedan that somehow takes up less than a full parking space.<p>These two points pretty much sum up Edwards' entire article; face these points with examples that contradict them, and maybe the issue will then be that we're all just driving the wrong car.",1327697799

You are just sharing your opinion, on topic to the post.<p>I work for Mozilla and I think that the only thing we are really losing on is the perception race.  A frequent trend I hear on forums and comment threads is how slow Firefox is or how much it crashes.  People seem to almost enjoy making the assessment that it is a universal constant.  I know that it isn't a constant.  Even though I have a profile that is many years old and has a dozen or so extensions installed, even though I have run prerelease versions for the last three years, I still generally have a stable and fast browsing experience.  Even when compared to Chrome which I install clean and try out for a couple of weeks every few months.  There have certainly been occasions that I have run into issues, but because I have been willing to give Firefox the benefit of doubt, I've dug into those issues and usually found something that was either a bad add-on, something bad I was doing, or a bad website to be the root cause.<p>We continue to strive to find ways to resolve these issues without having to rely on the user or the community to figure them out.  That is just part of making a good product.  But I know that the problems are not a universal constant that every user must deal with, or a reason to try to get everyone to move to a different browser.<p>One of the biggest projects my team (Metrics) has been working on lately is a way to enable people to easily measure the performance and stability of their own browser and compare it to the general population.  If it turns up systemic problems, that is wonderful because with evidence, it is easier to fix those problems.  If it turns out that a person with poor performance is obviously an extreme outlier to the typical performance, hopefully it will make it easier to change the conversation from ""Firefox is slow for everyone and no one should use it"" to ""Firefox is slow for me and I would like help making that not be the case for both me and anyone else who ever ends up in my situation"".  This would be a paradigm shift that would obviously be great for Mozilla, but I think it would be great for Google or Microsoft or Apple if they chose to follow a similar strategy as well.<p>At the end of the day, many Mozillians do not hate Google Chrome because it is still pushing to make the web a better place.  Maybe not in all the same ways we push, but every little bit is better than none of it.",1327695419

I am also the creative director, so I would agree, we look the best :)<p>Now, ""best"" is relative, depending on your goals. Both of our frameworks, Ext JS and Sencha Touch, include every bit you need to make an app: Layout system, UI widgets, MVC, data binding, templates, I could go on. We also include a build system, so you can only use the pieces you need, so, even with all that we offer, your app is not ""bloated.""<p>That said, there are pros and cons to modularity vs. a unified system. There are some great microlibs out there, and independent devs are in an exciting stage right now, being able to mix and match frameworks as they see fit. From a team-based or enterprise perspective, though, this is not ideal: You are working with various APIs, certain frameworks can have duplicate code (ie. there's overlap in what jQuery and Underscore provide), and you're relying on individual devs or the open source community for fixes and enhancements. It's also a bit of a testing nightmare, as you need to re-test every time you update an individual component.<p>Also, we have a JavaScript-based API to creating things with our framework, which is quite different to the progressive enhancement method of other frameworks. The benefit to this, again, is performance, and a better architecture for an application. On the downside, this can be harder for novice web developers (those who focus on HTML/CSS instead of JavaScript).<p>At any rate, hope that helps some in making your decision.

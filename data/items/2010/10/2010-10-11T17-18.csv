Treats me right to rely on memory :) I'm leaving the explanation here for anyone that hasn't seen the clip. Thanks yummyfajitas for pointing out my mistake.<p>The gist of the reasoning is this: take any 3D object, and try and map it onto a 2D surface, and you're going to have to distort <i>something</i>. In the case of the Mercator map, the plan was to make a map that clearly showed ""shipping lanes"", i.e. if you draw a straight line on the map from one point to another, you can travel in a straight line in the real word between those points. This is important for sea travel (the Mercator map was created in the 1500's). The trade-off to this decision was that sizes were distorted.<p>More reading: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_map</a>",1286819861

One of the big selling points for me was the fact that it was free for up to 50 customers. I thought this was brilliant on their part because neither Recurly or Spreedly offer this. It got you locked into using their service, which is huge.<p>That being said, I bet that 95% of their users are under the 50 users/month threshold and it must cost a bit to support them all. They must have calculated that it just wasn't worth it.<p>I wish they would offer a cheaper plan for up to, say, 100 users. I think that would a great middle ground for new apps.<p>I wrote a blog post a few weeks ago comparing the costs of Recurly, Spreedly, and Chargify and concluded Chargify was way in front [1].

How do you think the client is going to view it? Many clients assume ownership of intellectual property, simply because they don't understand it. By calling them and asking them, you're transferring the judgement to them. Consider that many people view code like they do any thing else they buy. If I pay someone to construct a building for me, I assume that I own the building when it is completed. But do I own the rights to the design (plans) for the building? This question is far less clear unless defined in a contract.<p>Rather, a better strategy would be to talk to a legal professional who understands the law in this area. Because the contract did not spell out who will ""own"" the code, he (the author) must gain an understanding of the legal perspective in these situations before he squanders his opportunity to reuse the code.<p>Even if the conversation with the client resulted in their agreement that the bherms can do whatever he likes with the code, that doesn't clear up the legal issue. What happens a few years from now when this charity is under different leadership and they notice the similarity between their management system and the one that sells for $30/month from whatever business bherms starts?<p>Talk to someone who knows these answers before you proceed.

One was mostly aligned with credit card companies, one was an company that offered this in conjunction with travel insurance. Interestingly, all agents in both cases were in the US. (It's possible some call QA was offshored, I don't recall in these instances but that's very common.)<p>In my review, the providers had little familiarity with the data security controls of the credit card industry (aka PCI). One was PCI certified, one was not but 'working on it'. The one that had been certified had somehow convinced their QSA (the PCI auditor) to not review the systems their agents used, only the core infrastructure.<p>The provider with home-based agents let their agents use their own computers to service callers, and it was quiet possible that the agent had never met anyone from the hiring company face-to-face.<p>Now, as a matter of course, probably only 1-3% of the calls actually required the agent take a credit card number (to order something for the customer). Most of the time the agents were just answering questions. Most of the agents would never see the caller's credit card number from the issuing bank.<p>From a information security point-of-view I wouldn't have any problem using the providers I reviewed (although, even as a frequent traveller, I've <i>never</i> had an occasion where it seemed like it would be useful), but I'd stop short of giving them my credit card number.",1286817665

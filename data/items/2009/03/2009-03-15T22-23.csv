It is completely legal to make the claim as long as you demonstrate that it's true to the FDA and they accept your data. If the benefit were actually present, they could file safety & efficacy data with the FDA and on approval legally make the claim.

(It's unlikely that you're the one in 100,000 entrepreneur who has a brilliant idea others just can't see the brilliance of.) Otherwise I don't think there's much of a good argument for turning down equity financing for a high-risk venture.<p>It just makes a lot of sense economically: your biggest asset as a poor entrepreneur is your time and effort, and you need some capital to make your project happen. Investors have a lot of capital, but only a finite amount of time/effort to do things with it. So it's a fair trade: you put in time/effort, and the investor puts in money. If you just finance everything with debt, you end up having to incur both downsides of losing time and money -- and the downside of losing $100k in capital is a lot worse for you than for the rich investor. If the project fails, you'll have to spend time/effort to repay the $100k instead of just moving on to the next project.",1237157744

Of course, a distinct pattern in voluntary responses tells us SOMETHING (maybe about what kind of people come forward to respond), just as a correlation tells us SOMETHING (maybe about a lurking variable correlated with both things we observe), but it doesn't tell us enough to warrant a firm conclusion about facts of the world.

Can you read an HFS+, UFS, ZFS or EXT2 volume on your windows box?<p>* Having an app open, and having a document window open are two different things.  This takes a while to wrap your head around, but it's much nicer to keep (say) textmate running, cmd-tab to it then cmd-n for a new window than having to do the whole start menu dance to get a new editor window open.<p>Other than that, I'd say you'll find it's just personal preferences and experiences that you may see the benefits of in time, particularly with regard to things like window management and app install which I honestly find vastly superior on Mac.  Let's just not mention the uninstall.  In a month, I imagine the differences would still grate, but personally I now find it much more difficult going back to Windows line editing (home/end instead of cmd-> cmd-<) and other Windows behaviours having been on Mac for so long.<p>For me, it's all a bit pavlovian I guess.

Terrorism will occur regardless of banking laws.<p>> At ""best"" it enables the very wealthy to not pay their fair share.<p>If there was a flat tax regime you can (maybe) try to make that believable. Why is it that rich people pay a higher percentage of their income in tax? It is simple – ten wolves and a sheep deciding who is for dinner. The whole idea of progressive taxation is the mob taking what it wants because of its majority – there is no inherit “fairness” in it.<p>A politician buys the vote of the poor with the money from the rich (coerced through taxation).<p>> If you have a problem with being overtaxed, the only respectful approach is to be active in managing how your government works.<p>In my country there are 4 million tax payers and about 14 million people receiving government “grants” (this will probably quadruple in a year's time in a plan to give everyone a “basic income grant” (BIG)). Is it fair that 4 million productive people subsidise 14 million unproductive people? Is it fair that a young tax-paying couple puts off having a child – yet their tax dollars is used for other peoples' child grants?<p>> And a ""good"" lawyer should never cover for crimes.<p>A “good lawyer should always act in their clients' best interest – whatever it may be.<p>In summary my argument is as follows:<p>1.There are plenty of reasons why banking should be private.
2.IMHO tax evasion by overtaxed people (i.e. when the tax percentage is progressive) is not morally wrong.<p>EDIT: Downmod all you want.",1237154983

But to speculate:<p>If the femtocells are to work in an urban environment, they'll have to work with many to a city block -- or even single apartment building. That is, about the same density as wifi access points. I can see 7 SSIDs right now from my kitchen table; from the roof of my building I can see 20-something. (Of course only a fraction of these are usefully connectable.)<p>So why not a femtocell in the ACC everywhere there's a wifi access point? That would seem to mirror the best case for deployment once they're for sale to home users.<p>Or at least a half-dozen in the corners of the venue?

517303,story,,,12,42,cool-RR,"Ask HN: ""Y Combinator for people?""",,"Hello fellow HNers!<p>In the last week I've been thinking about an idea that I'd like to share with you.<p>In one sentence: It's a fund which gives high-interest loans of about $100,000 to entrepreneurs.<p>Here's a rough sketch of how it will happen: (all numbers listed here are just suggestions and will probably vary)<p>The fund chooses people who will receive the loan, in a process similar to how YC chooses hackers. The goal is to choose people whose chances of becoming millionaires are as high as possible. Those people are then given the loan. The loan consists of $10,000 paid immediately, and $2,000 paid every month for five years. All money will be lent at an interest of 20% per year. The entrepreneur may pay off any portion of the loan at any time he wishes; Additionally, there will be a deadline, say 5 years, by which he will have to pay off the entire loan.
Entrepreneurs are not expected to report to the fund about their progress, or to explain what they would do with the money.<p>Why is it good for the entrepreneurs?<p>It's a little superfluous to explain, but anyway: The entrepreneurs will not have to work for money. They could spend all their time studying or hacking or working on a start-up without any investment or whatever they want.<p>Why is it good for the fund and its investors?<p>The fund will make a return on the investments paid to it. Assuming the selection process is 85% successful, the total interest generated by the fund will be 5% per year. If entrepreneurs will be willing to take the loans at higher interest rates (I would personally agree to 30%,) the fund interest could exceed 10% per year.<p>(Note about this calculation: it turned out to be a much more complicated one than I thought. If you think I made a mistake and you have the correct result, please examine it very carefully before posting. As for my assumptions, I assumed successful entrepreneurs will pay off the loan after three years, and that unsuccessful ones will take all 5 years, and then only $10,000 will be scraped from the guarantors.)<p>-------<p>The trickiest part, of course, is choosing the entrepreneurs.<p>The goal is to choose people who have the highest probability of becoming rich in the allotted five years. If that can be done well enough, the fund can succeed. I think it can be done, and in a similar way to how YC selects hackers.<p>It should also be noted that even an entrepreneur who has failed to get rich by the end of the four year can resort to taking a job at a big company. One year of that will pay off most of the loan, and will allow him to take a separate loan from the bank to cover the rest. This means that a 85% successful selection process doesn't require that 85% will become millionaires: If 60% become millionaires, and 25% get a ""good"" job at a big company, then this will also work.<p>-----<p>I would say that this idea is sort of ""Y Combinator for people"", in contrast to the original Y Combinator which is targeted at companies. Actually it seems like a logical step: If the most important ingredient of a start-up is a determined entrepreneur, why not invest directly in the entrepreneur?<p>So I hope you have some constructive comments about this, and I hope even more that someone reading this will pick up the glove and do it.",1237154608

6995479,comment,6995077,6995077,4,0,famousactress,,,"There seems to be quite a bit of negativity in the thread about the Brewery&#x27;s action. Some adorable holding up of the idea that it&#x27;s unfair or unethical to violate Starbuck&#x27;s trademark and then flip the reaction to one&#x27;s advantage.<p>I think that&#x27;s complete bullshit. I also think the fact that people have been conditioned to think that way is a big part of the reason why there&#x27;s such an enormous and growing wealth and power divide in the world today.<p>There aren&#x27;t ethics in a vacuum, and (despite some pretty interesting legal decisions here in the US lately) Starbucks isn&#x27;t a person. It isn&#x27;t even a bunch of people. It&#x27;s an emergent super-organism that coldly evaluates actions and their consequences against a consumer market.<p>I promise you that if the consequence-computer told them they could name a coffee after some small brewery and turn a profit from the reaction (regardless of the law), they would do it. Of course they would!<p>There are no ethics in a vacuum. Applying an ethical framework when dealing with an organization this large is silly and puts you at a disadvantage. There are laws and consequences. In this case, the C&D is a very affordable consequence and the small business owner leveraged the entire situation to his advantage. Good for him.",1388595576

Nothing personal.<p>I work as an assistant teacher every now and then and it is mostly small group teaching and going over the homework exercises. What I have seen is that the first couple of sessions are totally worthless subject wise. But they are extremely critical. During those sessions the students learn to know each other and me. When everyone is comfortable attending the sessions can the actually learning begin.<p>From this perspective I think MOOCs would need the following. Firstly, you need to create small enough groups of people that are comfortable discussing the subject with each other. Encouraging local study groups is a one way of doing this. The other thing is to encourage discussion through anonymity with forums or IRC. And you need to acknowledge that you don&#x27;t reach all of your students with these methods and not rely on them too much.<p>> I personally like to learn in isolation, I have a tendency to quickly ~plagiarize ideas of others thinking I understand, so learning alone in my room is better.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with self-study per se, but it has a one great flaw. It is easy do the kind of plagiarization I think you are talking about without knowing. This can be remedied by getting feedback from an instructor, or going through the material with someone else and then cross checking how you understood the ideas.",1388595138

Happy to work either on-site or remotely.<p>I&#x27;m a full-stack developer with a sweet spot for back-end work and distributed systems. Available for contract work from the 8 Jan. Happy to meet for a face-to-face chat if you&#x27;re in London. Email in profile.<p>My strongest technical expertise currently lies with the .NET / Windows stack (C# 5, .NET 4.5, ASP.NET MVC 4, Razor, TPL, async / await, SQL Server 2012, PowerShell, RabbitMQ) and the iOS / Cocoa stack (Objective-C, UIKit, Core Data, Core Animation, AFNetworking).<p>I have also worked with a range of other languages and technology stacks, including Python, Java and C++ on Windows, OS X and Linux, have strong fundamental knowledge of software engineering principles and am able to get up-to-speed very quickly on other stacks.<p>A bit more about me:<p>In the 10 years since I graduated with an MSc in software engineering from one of France’s leading engineering college, I’ve been held positions in several industries, including as a researcher in an academic research center, a senior software developer in one of the world’s largest investment bank and a technical co-founder in a tech startup that attracted investment from several of Europe’s top-tier angel investors.<p>I’ve worked both independently and as part of a team, including distributed teams. I’ve also hired and managed contractors.<p>I’ve designed and implemented several large-scale distributed software systems. In all the positions I’ve held, I’ve been involved in the full life-cycle of the project, from requirement gathering, initial design and implementation through to deployment and production support.<p>In my most recent role as technical co-founder of a funded tech startup, I’ve been in charge of the entire technology stack of the business, including system architecture, software development, sysadmin / DevOps, production issue troubleshooting and customer support. I’ve also been involved in all other aspects of the business, including business planing, product management and fund raising.<p>This experience has provided me with a breadth of knowledge and expertise, both on the technical and on the business side, rarely seen in a software engineer. It also allowed me to realise that I much prefer working on crafting great software than on writing business plans or networking with potential investors. Not that I believed otherwise before I started.<p>I’m now looking to take on a role where I can focus on the technical side. While my area of predilection lies in back-end work, as a full-stack software engineer I can jump in at any level of the software stack and take ownership of an entire project or feature, from back-end to front-end.",1388594790

Other comments here are right, the main way to deal with this is single use card numbers that can be revoked individually.<p>I think a good way would be to implement something similar to what OAuth does. When you want to make a payment to Amazon for example, you tell your bank who you are and after authenticating you, they would provide a token to Amazon who can store that to use for purchases.

Then, with &#x27;&#x27;.join(b&#x27;abc&#x27;), he appears to want to bust up a byte string and concatenate it back to a text string.  But I suspect he meant to type this:<p><pre><code>  >>> b&#x27;&#x27;.join(b&#x27;abc&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nThat is, bust up a byte string and concatenate back to what you start with: a <i>byte</i> string.  But that doesn&#x27;t work, when you bust up a byte string you get a list of <i>ints</i>; and you cannot concatenate them back to a byte string (at least not elegantly).",1388592906

Since you&#x27;re not doing the DOM manipulation yourself, it&#x27;s completely airtight and you don&#x27;t need to worry about writing custom DOM manipulation code for each individual part of the UI that can change. Of course, in any framework you can rerender the entire DOM by setting innerHTML on the top level but that tends to be slow and you need to watch out about resetting scroll position, input focus (and value), etc. React takes care of all of this for you.<p>(You&#x27;re right that invalid user input is something you need to deal with regardless, but you should need to deal with that only when making forms, never when displaying data that you already have (which is the common case). As for fallback values, it&#x27;s easy to write something like<p><pre><code>  <div>{this.props.author || &quot;(anonymous)&quot;}</div>\n</code></pre>\nin React when building a view.)",1388592053

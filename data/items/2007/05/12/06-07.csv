Entrepreneurs engineer four, five, six plans and execute them in tandem, wagering that at least one plan will get traction.""<p>Ok, I've about had it with these advice lists.  Do one thing well.  Try 5 things and see what sticks.   Bootstrap, don't bootstrap, etc... etc...<p>I think the only thing that makes sense is to just start working and go from there.  Then you can write your own 'advice' some day, if you are successful.",1178953164

21533,comment,21413,21413,0,0,davidw,,,"I'm pretty happy with Rails.  It's not perfect, but it's <i>widely</i> used, does most of what I need, and looks to be around for the long haul at this point.  Ruby's pretty nice too - I like it a bit more than Python, but for pretty much entirely subjective reasons. I think Django would be a good choice too.",1178952269

But, I'm probably just not hanging out with the folks that think that way.  They must exist...right?<p>It just seems so counter-productive.  The tools in the Open Source world are just so much better, and so much more widely varied.  One of my consulting gigs involved lots of MS ware (desktop apps) a couple of years ago, and I was able to look at all of the development tools via MSDN.  I just don't get the mindset that leads to Visual Studio and .Net and such.",1178950089

You wouldn't get 4.0 if you're not smart, except if you go to Podunk college. <p>Of course it doesn't necessarily translate to good programming ability because one has no 10 years programming experience. But it's what people perceived to be ""RAW talent"". <p>By the way, there are people who are good at programming but not great at solving complex problem. There's a reason why Google hired PhD and MSc to build the search engine. Compare that to Reddit people. Reddit people can code I give them that, but they can't write a site ""search"" feature.

He's making millions by himself, a total  solo effort.<p>In fact there area lot of examples out there of people doing this... many of them are of the professional blogging/seo/domainer variety.  What people on here would deride as ""lifestyle businesses""  (Personally I don't think you get to deride someone's choices until you've done better than them.) <p>But further, there's a whole movement of ""micro-isvs"" - a poor term as it came from someone with a microsoft perspective--  but these are people who make software themselves and sell it.  Many of these businesses are on their way to becoming large enterprises.  Omni Group is an example of one that's had several years, but Delicious Monster is one that's only been at it a few years- very successful, good number of employees now, single founder.  And of course there's scores more.<p>You know, what we really need is a version of TechCrunch- but one that covers these non-VC backed startups- the companies that won't get coverage in TechCrunch because they are not following the latest fad and burning money on lavish parties to invite Michael Arrington to.   For all the little companies you never heard of on TecCrunch there are other little companies who are going to be more successful ... but are under the radar now.  I think this is what leads to a distorted perspective of the startup landscape. \n",1194549822

After all, having a 4.0 GPA isn't much of a differentiator, and GPA is a poor indicator of programming ability anyway.<p>It's possible to get a good programming job without a college degree as long as you've done enough interesting coding projects outside of school. I didn't have any trouble landing interviews after I got kicked out of college, and I chalk this up almost entirely to the fact that I was able to fill out my resume with hobby projects I'd done previously.

I'd like to see him provide some evidence.   Giving him more ""starting cred"" is the problem with the YC way of doing things- its a cult of personality and the personality in question gives some good advice but also some bad advice. <p>However, you can look at any list of the richest people, or any list of successful startups, and you'll note that most of them were founded by individuals.  Though you gotta restrict your data to companies that have lasted a decade or so- otherwise you havent' given the founding teams time to split apart.<p>",1194549220

I think unless you have known the person a long time, you can't know if they are ""good"" or not- its not whether they are good or not, as the most earnest, responsible, loyal and considerate founder may still be the death of your company.   Its  fundamental to the nature of trying to manage a company by consensus.  <p>Consensus management doesn't work- or we'd be up to our ears in all the communes the hippies started in the 60s and 70s.",1194549044

77585,comment,77246,77518,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nActually, I'm not confusing them, PG is.  What I advocate is having a single leader, and whether you call employees 2-4 ""co-founders"" or not, they all know who is boss.<p>PG thinks that you have to have consensus and multiple founders all with an equal say.  Thus, multiple leaders.<p>The whole cofounder thing has taken on quite a weird perspective-- I think because PG doesn't have much experience with it, but is adamant, and most of his readers have never worked for a startup, let alone started one, so they believe he's preaching the gospel.<p>There has to be a leader, that's my point.

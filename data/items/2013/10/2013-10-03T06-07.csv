Good for Kaspersky, but effectively Lodsys collected payments on this particular patent from 54 out of 55 companies and then Kaspersky let them keep the patent in exchange for leaving them alone. Not sure if this is worthy of celebration at all.",1380783559

The sharks have no information on the companies pitching before they walk in to the room, but I&#x27;m sure the producers do some home work to only let in entrepreneurs that will make for good TV. The sharks are all smart people so they know what to ask but its no where near a ten minute affair.<p>All the due diligence is done after the show ends. The deal you see on TV is only tentative until after the due diligence. Quite a few of the deals on the show have actually fallen through after some shady things have been uncovered",1380782908
6487527,comment,6487350,6487510,37,0,pzxc,,,"I&#x27;ve read interviews before where it was indicated they know nothing (and want to know nothing) until they walk through the doors to make their pitch.  The extensive due diligence is done after the show, which is why deals struck on the show often fall through later on. For example, some of the companies that pitch indicate that they have patents, but of course the validity and defensibility of such patents is something that has to be researched, not something you can take their word for. So on the show they&#x27;re like, &quot;Do you have a patent?&quot; and they reply, &quot;Yes (or no)&quot; and that&#x27;s the end of that line of questioning because it has to be researched independently.<p>The reason they seem to get to the crux of the issues so quickly, is because like most reality shows, it is heavily edited. A five or ten minute segment on the show reflects sometimes hours of questioning and discussion. From what I understand they have VERY long days (much longer than 8 hours, more like 12-14 hours a day) so it&#x27;s almost an endurance thing for the sharks, because they spend so much time fleshing out the issues (and why wouldn&#x27;t they since they&#x27;re investing real money).<p>Personally I love the show also.  Also check out Dragon&#x27;s Den, which has both a Canadian and a British version (same format though, 5 investors all competing), and more recently CNBC&#x27;s show The Profit where Marcus Lemonis (who was on the Secret Millionaire) by himself goes to failing businesses and invests a hundred K or two and takes over management for a week to turn things around.<p>I love this new era of entrepreneurship-themed TV, beats the hell out of Survivor or Lost. =)",1380782904

In my biomedical field, that is everything from medical workflow to regulatory affairs to product pipelines to validation studies.<p>More broadly, I&#x27;m doing this exploration in the context of a <i>tractable</i> project that has involved both research and commercialization.

It&#x27;s just quite unlikely.<p>- SQRL lacks strong web-site identification, that&#x27;s a bad thing. Domain name isn&#x27;t strong authentication. I would like to include strong site identity with within the QR-key. (Evil website attack, NS spoofing / MITM)<p>+ No shared secrets is a real bonus. Except, if the attacker has full access to the site already and steals password, they can steal everything else. Therefore if password hashes are stolen, it&#x27;s major breach of security, and all passwords should be immediately reset. Of course nobody&#x27;s using same password for separate sites. So, site was breached and thats it anyway.<p>/ Out-of-band authentication, well, in some cases yes, in some cases no. I wouldn&#x27;t call this true out of band solution. Especially when using mobile browser, or shared WLAN connection. Fact that authentication data is also routed on same internet route at the server end sounds quite likely. Of course this can be fixed by service provider if they really want to do it.<p>+ No third-party, that&#x27;s the only way to go. In anycase when there&#x27;s a third-party, the solution already sucks badly. That&#x27;s one of the main reasons why I hate most of SSO solutions. (Single Sign On)<p>- Mobile (nor desktop) devices aren&#x27;t secure, having keys in mobile device isn&#x27;t considered to be secure and those can be extracted. Default mobile device protection isn&#x27;t good enough for password / identity protection. Most of people aren&#x27;t even using simple 4 digit pin. Real + would come form completely separate authentication device.<p>- Using long password with mobile is horrible. My GPG private key password is 20+ chars including tons of special chars. Try typing that with mobile, repeatedly. If shorter passphrases / keys are used, not enough entropy is included.<p>- &quot;A password lockout system&quot;. Eh? Same method should prevent any web-site password hacks too. ;) Anyway, with proper password, guessing should still be futile, read my statement about password earlier. If the password got even 128+ bits of entryopy, it&#x27;s going to be long guessing marathon. I don&#x27;t really care even if you try to guess 1 or 10000 pwd/seconds.<p>/ &quot;such as a personal safe deposit box&quot; - Is not truly secure, what a joke stament.<p>- Document doesn&#x27;t describe how identity authentication is linked to the actual client logging in. Basically this would mean that there has to be cookie version of cryptoraphic challenge, or some other data linked to that, which has to be stored for a while at web-servers end. Could this be used to create resource consumption DDoS attack on the service? That&#x27;s one of the reasons why I don&#x27;t like solutions which require web-server to maintain state for non-logged in users.",1380782091

UI doesn&#x27;t fit with Android standards, and on top of that it sucks too. An example of how to get it right on Android is the Google+ app. They should really be using the standard action bar (or at least a better emulation of it), and the standard navigation drawer. Facebook had an update for the iOS7 visual standards on release, but they still haven&#x27;t fully embraced the Holo themes introduced 2 years ago on Android. In fact, the Android app&#x27;s UI is essentially just bad port of how their old iOS6 app looked.<p>Poor performance overall, this has gotten better as they&#x27;ve switched to a more native UI, but it&#x27;s still worse than it should be. Scrolling performance is still a bit janky, even on the Nexus 4 -  A few seconds with overdraw shown gives plenty of things to fix.<p>The Image upload UI is pretty bad, especially that horrifically designed notification.<p>Twitter has similar issues, mostly to do with using non-standard + bad UI. They have a beta version now with a faked Navigation Drawer, but they got lots of things wrong so feels really out of place (why they didn&#x27;t use the standard one is a mystery).<p>Overall, the FB + Twitter Android apps clearly get a lot less love than their iOS apps. They have actually been getting better - the facebook app a few years ago was far worse (e.g. couldn&#x27;t see or add event comments, which is pretty obviously important on mobile), but they still have a long way to go before they match up to the quality of the Google apps on Android (some of which I have problems with also, but that&#x27;s a different issue!)",1380780157

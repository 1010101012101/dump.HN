80011,comment,79898,79898,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Self-learning has its own problems, some that have caught me out on more occasions than I care to admit. <p>I graduated with an EE degree six years ago, but over the years found myself more and more interested in economics. I read textbooks, papers and articles, and over time I thought I knew something about it. It was only when I went back to uni this year to formally study for an economics degree that I realised I knew jack. All the fundamentals and boring little details that I used to gloss over had more signficance than I'd ever thought. I also had access to the university resources, good instruction and a fairly rigorous course structure. Granted I was motivated and keen to learn (sadly unlike the bulk of the 19 year old kids there), but I gained a much more solid basis for understanding econs than I would have had I not gone back to uni.<p>I'm certainly no apologist for universities and schools, but wanted to point out that there are some issues with self-learning, namely 1) focussing only on the interesting topics and neglecting the fundamentals, 2) unstructured learning can be ill-directed and 3) good instruction is more efficient than finding your own way.",1195105759

I am using it, even thou i am replacing it's parts bit by bit with my own implementation, it is a good start for a very basic python framework  (then you can grown your own out if it).<p>That it is still pretty good for a young guy.  He probably has work/startup ADD.  Starting lots of things, but never finishing anything up.  Maybe lack of discpline, b/c of lack of work ethics guidance when he was a kid?<p>Other than that  boh...   Now qweartyy, why so jelous of him?  ",1195105510

PG mentioned early on that the admins included YC founders, so I've sort of assumed that <i>all</i> YC founders are admins though on reflection I don't really have good reason to believe that. <p>Either way ""mark this such that brett loses clout once pg pushes the new ranking sw"" is still probably far less satisfying than ""get this crap off the front page now"" would be.",1195104274

80003,comment,79898,80000,0,0,curi,,,"School is unpleasant. This turns people off learning. Then schools say: see? kids don't like learning. we have to force them.<p>That isn't a valid argument. If pleasant, voluntary, interest-based learning was offered, you don't know how children would react.<p>The same thing with your sister. the offer usually made is something like: obey me, and do your schoolwork. it won't be fun, but when you grow up you'll thank me later. if you don't obey, i'll hurt you.<p>That provides no information about how your sister, or any other child, would have behaved if offered some better options.\n",1195103188

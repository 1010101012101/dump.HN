You can just buy a mac and use it.<p>Oh, and complaining about Apple not supporting your crap phone? Why not bitch about Microsoft creating proprietary protocols (like Exchange) in the first place. Apple has gone a long way to sync with a lot of phones, and helped standardize the process.

One of the plotters was already under police surveillance, so the plan was doomed from the start.<p>I don't know why terrorists don't use guns for mass killings, but I suspect it has something to do with the psychological impact.  You don't want the attack to be psychologically attributed to individual people who are captured or killed after the attack.  It decreases the terror factor.  You want the attack to be attributed to a group or a cause, which is much scarier because the force behind the attack is still out there operating.  In a suicide attack, the perpetrators are seen as whatever force inspired and controlled the attackers, so there is a continued threat.",1273071106

At that time, terrorism in the Muslim public's mind was mostly associated with Palestinians fighting Israeli occupation, and the 9/11 attack was framed as a blow against U.S. occupation of the Arabian Peninsula.  I'm sure many potential terrorists have since heard their friends, family, and neighbors comment unfavorably on the 9/11 attacks and their consequences for Muslims and for the image of Islam.  That might hurt recruiting among people who are smart and social enough to be part of a large-scale attack.",1273068762

1321206,comment,1320763,1320840,0,0,grellas,,,"Having clerked for a federal judge and spent my career appearing before them at various levels, I would say it is inaccurate to portray Supreme Court justices in particular as being out of touch even if they did grow up in an era where all the modern gadgetry did not exist.<p>The justices have astonishingly strong powers of analytical ability, as any attorney who has ever argued a case before them will attest (just imagine what it would be like if you had to prepare to field questions that might come at you from thousands of different angles from some of the smartest people around on a very complex set of legal questions such as those touching the fundamentals of the patent system, its history, its potential application to a huge range of inventions, etc. - ""daunting"" is a good word to describe the prospect of the challenge you would face).<p>Each justice is supported by law clerks drawn from the ranks of the best schools and who are easily within the top 1% of the law graduates in the nation (e.g., of the Harvard Law Review caliber of graduate). Much of the legwork of sorting through the myriad briefs filed in a complex case such as <i>Bilski</i> is done by the clerks. The average age of these clerks is probably something like 25, meaning that they themselves grew up with all the modern technology and are quite familiar with all the normal user experiences associated with it. As part of deciding a case, the justices not only have their clerks sort through the briefs and summarize their import in memos but also talk extensively with them about the key issues involved - all of this long before oral argument.<p>In a case such as <i>Bilski</i>, you also get the most impressive range of legal briefs imaginable. For a sampling, see this listing, with links to the briefs themselves (<a href=""http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/08/briefs-in-bilski.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/08/briefs-in-bilski.htm...</a>). These are submitted not only by the parties themselves but by dozens of industry participants, trade groups, and other interested ""friend-of-the-court"" parties (such as EFF) - the piece I link to above lists 44 of them and that is not a complete list.<p>The Supreme Court also has the benefit of being able to wait until a case matures to the point where it feels the time is right to address certain important issues. It does this by having the discretionary authority to grant what is known as a writ of <i>certiorari</i> in deciding whether or not to hear a case. This means that an issue can kick around in the federal courts for years or even decades, with decisions going all over the board on it, and only when the Court decides it is ready for some definitive determination does it grant this writ and take up the issue at the highest level. This is what happened with the question of ""what is the legitimate scope of patentable subject matter"" in the <i>Bilski</i> case.<p>Thus, you have a tremendous wind-up leading to this sort of decision, with some very smart people prepping the issues along the way for submission to justices whose analytical strengths are sometimes even legendary (e.g., Scalia). Whatever result they come up with, I'm pretty sure it won't be some naive one based on failure to understand what an email is or some such thing. We may disagree with it on substance but I'm confident it will be something that is carefully through and fully up to speed concerning whatever counts in technology as well as law.",1273068458

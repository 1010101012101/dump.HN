I suggest using ProxyCommand instead and I, myself, use that probably 50 times a day every day.<p>I have dozens of servers running Linux and FreeBSD that, naturally, have `sshd` enabled for remote access.  Even though (almost) all of my servers have public IP addresses, there are only three of them accessible via SSH from &quot;the world&quot; -- two OpenBSD hosts and one RHEL host.<p>The two OpenBSD machines are &quot;jumpboxes&quot;: their only purpose is to serve as a gateway into the network and to all of the other servers.  Instead of SSH&#x27;ing into one of them and then SSH&#x27;ing out to the actual machine I want to log into, I make heavy use of &quot;ProxyCommand&quot; in my $HOME/.ssh/config so that I can just run, e.g. &quot;ssh mx-out&quot;.  An SSH connection to one of the jumpboxes is established and, through that, a connection to the actual server is then made. Since I use keys for authentication, I don&#x27;t have to enter my password or passphrase twice (or even once) and the &quot;magic&quot; is completely transparent to the user once it&#x27;s initially set up.<p>The RHEL host (which I&#x27;ve hardened as much as possible) is for web hosting customers to connect to in order to upload/download files into their web space. It is not a web server, itself, but it is an NFS client so that customers don&#x27;t need to log into the actual web servers themselves.",1440967781
10144455,comment,10143700,10144371,0,0,kens,,,"Your description of the IBM 1401 startup sequence is absolutely right. I&#x27;ll fill in some details since it&#x27;s a strange process. There&#x27;s no operating system at all: pressing the load button on the card reader causes one card to be read into memory and the first instruction executed. The first few cards in a program deck have special loader initialization code. As you say, the first instruction is &quot;write two word marks&quot;, making the next two instructions executable. The next few instructions are more &quot;write two word marks&quot; instructions, until there enough word marks in place to run a few other instructions, which clear memory and load the next card.<p>The cards for the program to be executed have program code on the left half and loader code on the right half. That is, each card has code to move its program code into the right place in memory, add necessary word marks, and then load the next card. This code is running from the reader buffer (locations 1 through 80). The final card jumps to the location in memory to start execution.<p>TL;DR: Since the IBM 1401 doesn&#x27;t have an operating system, when loading a program from cards, each card also contains the code to load itself into memory.<p>And yes, 4K of memory is 4000 characters, not 4096, because it&#x27;s a decimal machine, not a binary machine.",1440967754

She had the &quot;standard&quot; treatment, surgery to remove as much of the tumor as feasible, radiation and chemo. In the end, she passed away in about 4.5 months from her initial diagnosis. The doctors had originally given her 1-2 years; I don&#x27;t know if that was just an optimistic estimate in order to give some hope, or whether my mother just happened to be one of the cases which didn&#x27;t survive the average estimate (everyone can&#x27;t beat the average...).<p>Due to other life circumstances, I didn&#x27;t have that much opportunity to research the issue, but my takeaway was basically that you can group stuff you find on the internet into 3 groups: A) research, results which may be inconclusive or at least not dramatically better than the standard treatment B) desperate grasping at straws, typically by patients or their kin, not experts in the field C) scams prying on the emotional anguish of the affected persons.  So my conclusion and recommendation would be to trust your oncologist, and/or if you want another opinion, ask another oncologist. Unless you&#x27;re an expert able to distinguish the wheat from the chaff, don&#x27;t put to much trust into whatever you may find on the internet. (FWIW, I have a research background, although not in medicine; YMMV.)<p>Beyond the medicine and treatment thing, a few other points:<p>Realize that glioblastomas have <i>extremely</i> poor 5-year survival rates (or however you wish to measure it). While a positive attitude is always important in dealing with any serious disease, the bottom line is that, most likely, your relative will pass away within a couple years. There is no miracle cure.<p>IOW, perhaps rather than obsessing over whatever cures may be brewing in research labs, focus on your relatives quality of life for whatever time she/he may have remaining. Also keep in mind that brain cancers are nasty in that they can change the personality of the patient, and towards the end they can get more and more incoherent, sleep more and more and eventually go into a coma. So if you have something important to say to or discuss with your relative, do it ASAP rather than wait until it may be too late.<p>My family, including my mother, took solace in that she had lived an almost full life, she was on the verge of retirement etc. I can only hope that your relative is also older, for a younger person I can only imagine how utterly devastating and hopeless it must be.<p>Best of luck to you and your relative.",1440965846

Coupling means dependencies between modules; cohesion means dependencies within a module. High cohesion reflects a module’s focus on just one responsibility, which really does need everything in the module to get done.<p>> > Woah, increased coupling is always a bad thing, right!?<p>Increased coupling <i>is</i> always a bad thing – all else being equal. But if increased coupling results in increased cohesion too, it may be worth it. Higher cohesion is better, and lower coupling is better.<p>> All use is coupling. All reuse is additional coupling. A system with minimal coupling is a system without any abstraction or invocation.<p>How do you know you don’t want such a system? Because it has very low cohesion. The duplicated parts all over your codebase will only be used by a few parts of their modules, rather than most of their modules.<p>Note that cohesion is measured relative to the size of the module, not as an absolute count of connections. If you pointlessly extract the full body of a method to another differently-named method, you have increased the number of intra-module connections. But you have decreased cohesion, because the module is now bigger, yet your new method is only called once within the whole module.",1440965699

The biggest one is that any thought that you experience in your mind is it&#x27;s own thing (thought, distinct from concepts, which are much more subtle and ephemeral).<p>The reason is that for the mind to experience and process thoughts, the thought itself is carried by emotional streams. There is a wide-spread tendency in people with high intelligence to fool themselves into thinking they have high emotional intelligence, or don&#x27;t need it.<p>These emotional carrier waves on which thought rides on have an affect on your ability to think on things, or decide on an action. One common neuroticism is when the thoughts start looping on each other. On the surface, those loops appear to chain rationally and logically, one to the next, but if you were to pull your awareness from the thought and go deeper into the emotion, you&#x27;ll see it is actually the emotions in control.<p>Suppressing the emotions and awareness of the emotions will actually backfire on you. You get more stupid when you do. You cannot separate thought from emotions. (As I mentioned before: concepts and abstractions are more subtle, so it&#x27;s possible to flash through them without a thought-stream).<p>You can&#x27;t separate thoughts from the emotions on which thoughts rides upon. A lot of intelligent people with poor emotional intelligence will trick themselves into thinking they can. It does not help that accusing someone of being emotional has been weaponized.<p>Example: Most programming language / OS / design flame-wars are really people being moved by powerful emotions rather than a rational discussion, though the participants often trick themselves into thinking they are being rational.<p>tl;dr emotional intelligence will supercharge your existing intellectual prowess.",1440965000

88384,comment,88005,88075,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I just wanted to point out that in the black/white terminology, where Asians are yellow and Indians are brown, the Jewish aren't necessarily white. Jews are from the Middle East, whereas the common white-folk are from Europe. That is, depending on how you look at it, they are ""racially"" different (quotes significant).<p>Also, I am not a Jew, but Jews are a particularly interesting group by themselves and are not to be ignored. IQ and the Wealth of Nations is not really what you want to read. Gregory Cochran is (regardless of how vilified he may be). The list of Nobel laureates is also nothing to shrug off as simply a result of environmental factors. Steven Pinker gave a (supporting) talk on this topic. Statistically speaking, the ""Jewish"" (which is a fuzzy definition if you look into it) are, without any doubt, the group of people with the highest collective scientific and financial achievement in the world.<p>Meanwhile, who has ever pointed out that there are no Jewish basketball superstars, sprinters, weight lifters...? Are they endowed with inferior physical ability? Perhaps I shouldn't say so, but this ""deficiency"" is as glaringly obvious as their accomplishments, and it doesn't seem as sensitive a topic.<p>It's all about relative distributions. If a patient goes to a hospital to treat Torsional Dystonia, 99.9% of the time, they are Jewish. It also happens that heterozygotes of TD have higher myelin density. It also happens that Einstein had abnormally large glial growth (which affects myelin density). It is also common knowledge that Einstein's brain was structurally different than most humans and this difference was a genetic alteration.<p>No matter how you look at it, there are genetic influences in intelligence. It is logical that certain genetic traits may be more prevalent in certain localized populations. Now I said nothing about these groups based on skin color, but as a group that has been highly in-bred, the ""Jewish"" group of people are, statistically as a whole, incontrovertibly, ""superior"" in certain areas, that the current society finds valuable.",1197406651

88381,comment,88296,88373,0,0,shayan,,,"Since I have no idea what your product is, how big your team is, how much experience you have and what resources you have access to, it is hard to say how much saving is good and how much time you can spend with it (since the costs are also unkonwn).  <p>But I would say in general you would spend about 6 months developing your product, and having something ready anywhere from a good working alpha version to something more of a working prototype and work in progress.  I hardly doubt there are too many companies that can start generating revenues (let alone profits to spend on living expenses) within six months from the day they start. <p>So I would say the best way to do this is to start working on the idea before you quit your job, try to get a prototype or something together, and start looking for funding.  I think in your case at the end of six months you will def need outside money (again since I doubt you'll be generating revenues by then and you are out of savings).<p>So regardless, if you do quit, I would recommend you looking for money right away.  The worst thing to ever do is to ask for money when you need it, and when you are under pressure.  Take your time, do your shopping, find out how interested people are in your product and try to raise some <i>smart</i> money before your time is up.<p>and please do keep us in the loop, and good luck to you",1197405230

88373,comment,88296,88296,0,0,CarpeDiem,,,"Wow, thanks for all the comments!<p>@nickb: That Morgan Stanley report is what prompted this post.  I think it is prudent to question the source, however.<p>@shayan: My team and I have 6 months of savings, meaning we can pay the bills for 6 months before we either need income or investment.  Do you think that is long enough?<p>@skmurphy: This makes a lot of sense to me, there are a few anecdotal stories about 2002-2003 being a great time to have started a company.  And theres that report that ~50% of pre-1999 companies are still around.  Good point.<p>\nAfter thinking about it some more I came to several comclusions:\n  \n1.  I am very unhappy at my current job.  I'm young intelligent (or so I think), hard working, and I have big dreams.  I am capable of doing much more with my life than this job.<p>2.  If my startup fails, I can blame it on the economy.<p>3.  Maybe it is a bad time, and maybe it is a mistake to start a company right now.  But its a bigger mistake, even a tradgedy to be afraid of the unknown.  I won't let my life be run by fear.<p>I'll keep the YC crowd posted about our progress ;-)",1197403948

88371,comment,88005,88205,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Point 1 is easily attacked so I will. Definitely not a waste of time.<p>Suppose you don't deliberately study ""raw intelligence"" but are interested in autism. There are a bunch of genes related to the manifestations of autism. You have a relatively low-functioning empathy circuit, for example. You develop obsessions with numbers, for example. This could be a malfunctioning orbitofrontal circuit (which is also dysfunctional in OCD patients).<p>It is not a coincidence that some people with superior memories exhibit very similar symptoms as autists, but retain most of their social ability, and there you go, innate, genetic intelligence, almost as a side effect of an impartially developed disorder.<p>What's the benefit of researching Viagra outside of pleasure? It was an accidental discover during heart research (IIRC).<p>You don't even have to be curious about discovering what genes are responsible for ""superior"" mental functions. That's almost like trying to solve a puzzle with the expectation that you only connect the pieces that you consciously set out to connect.",1197403749

Bad judgement all around. Sure the pupil was in the wrong but we&#x27;re discussing this across timezones now, which means it has gone <i>way</i> beyond where it should have gone and you really can not blame the student for that.<p>That you&#x27;re more sensitive to this issue because you are a teacher is obvious (fwiw my brother was a high school History teacher and from the fact that that&#x27;s in the past tense you can take it as read that I understand some of the pressure), that should not get you distracted too much about what happened here.<p>&quot;malicious&quot; is a very stretchable word, I&#x27;ve lived in the &#x27;real world&#x27; long enough now that I think that I can recognize an over-reaction when I see one (and your comments are <i>also</i> over-reacting). The fact that teachers in the past have over-stepped their conduct should not result in those measures having effects on the future lives of students in their care, that&#x27;s just more fall-out.<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about access to your computer then protect it properly and refuse to work with a school that mandates insecure setups.<p>Having an insecure machine isn&#x27;t a valid defence against being hacked either, in that &#x27;real world&#x27; that you go on about you have an obligation to secure your property just as much as the other party has an obligation not to attempt to breach that security.<p>Where this all failed is where it began: education, if educators are not able to create an atmosphere where there is room for some give-and-take and where harmless pranks can ruin lives then we&#x27;ve all lost.<p>The reason why we use separate rules for minors and adults is that they are minors! Keep in mind you&#x27;re dealing with kids here and don&#x27;t ruthlessly apply the standards and rulesets for adults to kids. Half the time they don&#x27;t oversee the consequences of their actions.<p>> You have no idea how quickly bad news travels in a high school. If even one or two students happened to catch sight of the image on the teacher&#x27;s screen it would be the number one talking point across the school within hours. This would lead to an official administrative investigation within less than 24 hours! If the teacher didn&#x27;t immediately report the issue it would without a doubt be viewed as the teacher having something to hide. This kind of issue can very quickly escalate in a school setting.<p>If that&#x27;s the atmosphere you&#x27;re working in then you have already lost before you started.",1428836397

9362914,comment,9362786,9362786,0,0,xixixao,,,"For the article: If you try to argue for superiority, you should probably check the alternatives first and give an example where your preferred choice is obviously superior - the example of adding an empty body to each method is a great example where Sublime with multiple cursors beats vim (sure you can get them in vim to, but it doesn&#x27;t show vim being superior).<p>For vim itself: I have seen friends trying to learn it. I have seen PhDs and postdocs use it. I have seen coworkers use it. The only people who I could see were editing text as fast as friends/PhDs/coworkers using Sublime were my tech leads. The smartest most proficient and effective programmers I have ever met. Everyone else was slower, at times wrestled with the editor (by this I mean that they executed commands and had to redo them because they didn&#x27;t do what they wanted). I guess the conclusion is that people can learn to use vim as proficiently as Sublime, but most will fail or it will take them years (and I mean 5 or 10 years).<p>Actually, two of my tech leads, when I showed them some trick in Sublime were like: I should look into this. Maybe I&#x27;ll just boldly argue that vim is inferior after all :).",1428836352

9362904,comment,9362786,9362786,0,0,Theodores,,,"> Correct-conception #1: steep learning curve<p>I was fortunate to learn vi by rote, in a series of lectures where there was no computer in the room. Yep, copying the likes of &#x27;:wq&#x27; from the hand-written blackboard to A4 paper, along with all of the other &#x27;handy&#x27; commands, some of which such as &#x27;yank&#x27; I do not use to this day. This was a whole different way of learning with the notes referred to rather than things getting &#x27;Googled&#x27;. Was this a better way to learn vi?<p>I don&#x27;t meet so many &#x27;vi&#x27; experts these days, if anything I feel embarrassed to be using &#x27;vi&#x27; and associated command line tools like &#x27;grep&#x27; when everyone else has some auto-completing high-speed IDE instead. I have to &#x27;psr-fix&#x27; my code to make it sufficiently elegant. The problem for me is that I can do most things in &#x27;vi&#x27; without having to hunt around for menus etc. Therefore, moving to the new is hard for me. In some ways I am like a secretary knowing &#x27;Wordperfect&#x27; 25 years ago and unable to adapt to &#x27;MS Word 2.0c&#x27; due to the same UI problem and convenience of known tools (Wordperfect, Vim).<p>I also do not feel that &#x27;vi&#x27; works well in a team, people with Mac-gui-loveliness computers just can&#x27;t edit things on your computer on an ad-hoc basis, some visual editor has to be found just for them.<p>If you are a vim person then these funny new-fangled &#x27;gui&#x27; editors are really dangerous. It is far to easy for the document to end up with mystery &#x27;j&#x27; characters added to the first line, &#x27;:wq!&#x27; added somewhere at the end, maybe with some randon &#x27;ijk&#x27;s&#x27; in the middle. If you are a vim person then every editor should have an &#x27;insert&#x27; and &#x27;normal&#x27; mode, not just &#x27;insert&#x27;. The rest of the world doesn&#x27;t see that though.<p>With people that do use &#x27;vim&#x27; I have noticed that everyone does things differently. Some people will regularly use a feature that you never use, to make you wonder why you don&#x27;t know that trick. Life without the correct, personalised &#x27;.vimrc&#x27; file is also quite hard, however, I have found some of these that others use to be overly &#x27;souped up&#x27;, for instance the search, I really do not like the search-as-you-type option, old-school is better, where you need to press enter.<p>So everyone finds their own dialect of &#x27;vim&#x27;. Like car drivers, everyone thinks they are a good &#x27;vim driver&#x27; apart from those that haven&#x27;t learnt to drive. And they shouldn&#x27;t. Amazing that vim is, it is a relic of former times, there are better tools with better &#x27;UX paradigms&#x27;. In my field none of the &#x27;programming gods&#x27; use &#x27;vim&#x27; as they can&#x27;t get to their productivity levels with it, so they use modern IDE&#x27;s for their work, retaining enough &#x27;vim&#x27; for any server side config file editing.",1428835998

They have rewritten the Linux desktop environment from scratch, which is an enormous amount of work, and in my experience it works very well. Why not expect that you could find 10,000 users, many of whom people spending their professional life on computers, willing to pay $20 (which in the UK is about 4 cups of coffee), and actually be able to support some developers working on the project full time? That is not at all an unreasonable goal.<p>I know about 20 people over the age of 70 who I periodically help with computer problems, I would say about half of them still using XP on computers that cannot be upgraded to Windows 8. They principally use their computers for checking webmail and browsing the internet.<p>I have tried Ubuntu, but unfortunately it has all sorts of minor UI ruffles which make it difficult for many non-technical people to use. Some examples are: people really struggle to use its pop-up scroll bars, partly because the concept is apparently non obvious, and needs to be explained, and partly because they&#x27;re fiddly. Then, programs often open in the background, and don&#x27;t come to the front, so the only sign they&#x27;re ready is an illuminated icon to the left. And, you get regular pop-up which say &#x27;serious system error detected&#x27; which never seem to amount to anything.<p>And in general, I would say my experience is that it is not beautiful, polished or consistent enough to justify to non technical users the change in user interface which it asks them to make.<p>Linux is effectively a developer market, it is written by and for developers, to stratch and itch or for infrastructure. But there has been a consistent failure to produce an operating system that ordinary people want to use. In my opinion, Linux also needs a consumer market, which is willing to pay to bring in other professionals, principally designers, and support them in polishing the user interface, in the way that users want, to a heavy sheen. Elementary OS was a step in that direction, and it&#x27;s very disappointing to see it apparently shot down for a lack of ideological purity and/or just being abrasive. Hopefully, despite the level of outrage which many people feel, they will be able to find their 10,000 users out of the general Linux community, and carry on regardless.",1428835247

On the other side you see e.g. Jeroen Dijsselbloem[3] being presented as &quot;President of the Eurogroup&quot; and/or &quot;President of the ESM&quot;, while he could be easily be described in the same vein as a &quot;Right-right wing, non-economist with a false degree[4]&quot;.

Things get more interesting in Play2 when scalability or latency starts to matter.<p>That&#x27;s when you discover that Play2&#x27;s architecture is entirely asynchronous and that Play2 supports asynchronous responses and web sockets natively. It does so by means of futures [1], actors [2] and iteratees [3] (also being migrated to reactive streams [4]).<p>Of course, the easy route with Play2 would be with Java, however I recommend that you pick up Scala. By doing so you&#x27;re going to get exposed to concepts from functional programming in a language sitting on a platform that&#x27;s very much practical for real world use. There&#x27;s also this book on functional programming in Scala that&#x27;s amongst the best books written on the subject [5]. Functional programming changes the way you think and it&#x27;s all about sanity, functional code being easier to test, being easier to parallelize and being much less prone to accidental bugs.<p>But while you&#x27;re at it also consider learning Haskell, probably the best functional programming language available, because even if you&#x27;re not using it, it&#x27;s currently the lingua franca for FP concepts, so when reading papers and blog articles on interesting design patterns related to FP, most of them are described in Haskell. It also spoils you with its incredible type system, so a language like Scala will become the minimum that you&#x27;ll tolerate, working in Java, C#, Python or Go becoming unbearable ;-) A really good beginners course is this one from edX [6]. And then go learn Clojure, because it&#x27;s a really practical LISP that is also oriented towards FP, except that FP in a LISP is really different from FP in static languages like Haskell or Scala.<p>And you know, the best thing about this path is that you&#x27;re not going to learn just a framework, or yet another language, but you&#x27;re going to learn about functional programming, which is a concept that transcends programming languages with its related mentality and design patterns and is useful no matter what you&#x27;re doing and in what language.<p>But then going back to Scala and Play2, well that&#x27;s useful right now too.

And this is the key to our disagreement. As a practicing teacher, for me, unauthorised access of my computer by a student is not a harmless prank. It is a serious action <i>in its own right</i> requiring serious consequences. It would not be characterised by any teacher that is sound of mind as a &quot;harmless prank&quot;<p>The subsequent actions are immaterial. The access itself is already a serious issue. As teachers part of what we do is to build communities of ethical participants. I should be able to momentarily leave my desk unattended without fear of a malicious student defacing my desktop with a pornographic image.<p>Let me make this very clear - <i>it is the access itself that already makes this a serious issue, regardless of any potential harm that may or may not have been done in the process!</i><p>Of course as I have already stated many times:<p>1. Involving the police is an overreaction.<p>2. Treating it as a harmless prank is an underreaction<p>3. A reasonable middle ground should have been pursued by the school<p><pre><code>   > If you&#x27;re a high school teacher you&#x27;re going to have to have a ticker skin than that to let such stuff bother you.

This has nothing do do with having a thick skin.<p><pre><code>   >  your &#x27;reputation&#x27; is not going to be damaged one way or another by you putting up a picture on an overhead projector placed there by another person.
</code></pre>
You are conflating personal reputation with professional reputation. Your professional reputation absolutely can be harmed, even by completely unsubstantiated accusations. This is true of all workplaces, not just schools.<p><pre><code>   > But your reputation will be determined by how you respond to it.
</code></pre>
According to normal school policy this teacher acted exactly as they should by reporting this serious issue. By doing so they have preserved their professional reputation. <i>Not</i> reporting the issue would have been a breach of their contractual and ethical obligations.<p><pre><code>   > That computer came pretty close to not having access control either. Using the lastname of the teacher as a password does not count as &#x27;access control&#x27; imo
</code></pre>
This is a tangential issue. Yes the school should have had better password policies in place. &quot;your password was insecure&quot; is not a valid defense in respect to unauthorised computer use. If an adult tried the same in court they would be laughed out. And yes, this was not an adult, but as teachers part of our job is to educate our students about the real world. If we treat this issue as a &quot;harmless prank&quot; in school and then the young adult enters the real world after leaving school they will be surprised when a judge doesn&#x27;t buy their classic &quot;Harmless Prank&quot; defense!<p><pre><code>   > It should be fairly obvious that the teacher did not put the image there to all present, that&#x27;s the whole point of a prank. After all, it was found out who did it, wasn&#x27;t it?
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s not how things work in the real world. If a teacher is found to have any inappropriate material tied to their school account an investigation would (and rightly so) be conducted. I&#x27;m speaking from experience here. Schools take this kind of thing <i>very</i> seriously. This is why we as teachers also take this kind of action <i>very</i> seriously. There is no such think as &quot;haha just kidding buddy!! :)&quot; in a school setting.<p><pre><code>   > The teachers career was not in any danger so you&#x27;re still responding to what might have been, not what actually was.
</code></pre>
This is naive. The intent of the student was clearly malicious. The teacher was lucky and dodged a bullet. You have no idea how quickly bad news travels in a high school. If even one or two students happened to catch sight of the image on the teacher&#x27;s screen it would be the number one talking point across the school within hours. This would lead to an official administrative investigation within less than 24 hours! If the teacher <i>didn&#x27;t</i> immediately report the issue it would without a doubt be viewed as the teacher having something to hide. This kind of issue can <i>very</i> quickly escalate in a school setting.",1428833836

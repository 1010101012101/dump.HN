I think it's of merit but Apple actually has a really hard problem on their hands, namely that the app store UI is terribly simple and at the moment doesn't appear to have a good way to prioritize suggestions.<p>Given the metadata that they must have, it would be trivial to switch to gross revenue, or rev * review score, or any number of other things, including time. (Reddit/HN method of scoring articles)<p>For that matter there's no reason why they can't compare app store purchases you've scored to the scores of other people who've purchased the same application to suggest things. (Amazon ""people who purchased..."" or Netflix way of doing things)<p>Hey Apple, give me the ability to affiliate your store. You can have 95% control of the UI (I want a banner at the top) but I get to pick the sequence things are offered for a given search. Give me 5%, I will make you rich.

369014,comment,368877,368936,0,0,Timothee,,,"In a way, one issue with the App Store, is that it exists. Since people know it's there, they'll check it out to see what's available. As opposed to probably not looking for apps at all. (or less)<p>And finding a good way to rank the apps is not easy. By number of downloads doesn't work well, by revenue wouldn't work I think, by rating might work a little bit but then what?\nSo, the App Store is in fact not a great place to find good apps, just the most popular.<p>So, people go to the App Store but otherwise don't know where to go to find apps or information about apps. But the presence of the store makes the word-of-mouth a little bit more difficult because the store is supposed to be the place, so I suppose in general, people don't look anywhere else. (I know I don't) And people don't feel like sharing their discoveries as much.<p>Of course, I don't deny the huge benefit of the App Store. I would have never installed that many applications otherwise. But it's ""louder"" and covers some of the more traditional marketing and word-of-mouth.",1227059247

Its marketing, support, marketing, SEO, marketing, advertising, marketing, documentation, marketing, etc.<p>Oh, and there is some software involved, too.  But product quality only goes so far if your strategy for marketing is ""I put it up on the Internet and eventually people find me"".  (That _can_ work but you have to have God's own luck AND an amazing product.)<p>Here's another lesson for you: if people are not buying your software, the answer is NOT to charge less.  You can't convince people who aren't at your site to buy by offering them a discount -- they can't see the discount.  On the other hand, folks who then see the discounted price as the ""normal"" price mentally value it to match.  And software which only costs $10 is worthless.  You are selling me a tool to _make money_ and can't justify a price higher than $10?<p>(I leave it to your imagination what I think of the ""Make it free and try monetizing with ads!"" advice you'll find elsewhere in this discussion.)<p>I sell software which is so trivial that technical types have difficulty believing it sells at all.  My customers love me, and are happy to part with $25.  And I should really get around to raising that one of these days.  Should sell about $20k this year, which isn't quite quit-the-day-job money but on an hourly basis works out to ""pretty freaking sweet"".  Not to crimp the startup style here but, erm, charging people money for value remains a decent business model.",1227059142

He or she rejects success. You want examples? There are thousands of them, but one of the best is over 100 years old.<p>A man by the name of John Wesley Hyatt had invented the roller bearing. He made up his mind that it was just right for the axles of railroad freight cars. Railroads traditionally stuffed the wheels of their cars with rags soaked in oil to handle the friction. The railroads, however, were not ready for radical change; they liked their rags. And Mr. Hyatt went bankrupt trying to persuade them otherwise.<p>When Alfred Sloan, the man who later built GM, graduated from MIT at the head of his class in the mid-1890s, he asked his father to buy him Hyatt’s small bankrupt business. Unlike Hyatt, Sloan was willing to broaden his vision of the product. It turned out that the roller bearing was ideal for the automobile, which was just coming to market. In two years Sloan had a flourishing business; for 20 years Henry Ford was his biggest customer.",1227057712

The investors who bought the shares from him were going to buy the stock anyway; Cuban did not make any false representations or inducements to convince them to buy his stock.  In fact, it is pretty hard to argue that his trade created any victims at all, since the buyers would have been paying a higher price for the shares, and hence lost more money, if Cuban _hadn't_ been selling, since his quick exit pushed down the price.<p>Cuban's sale of stock added correct information to the markets.

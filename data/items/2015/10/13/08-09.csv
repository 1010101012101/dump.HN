Then if the person does not object, for example, then they strike once (with not excessive force), and wait to allow the other person to strike them (with proportional force) if they so choose.<p>There is not currently any social convention like this, but provided that the force used and amount of pain are small enough, and not excessively frequent, and people respond to objections reasonably, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be that bad if there was?<p>Pushing my fingernail against my other finger causes pain, but it does not cause suffering. When pains are small enough, I think the meaning/interpretation of the pain is more significant than the pain, so the actual pain is mostly irrelevant, except in that it stands for what it does.",1444726721

Use some of the shelf service that provides states and you don&#x27;t need to update that frequently (e.g. ElastiCache, Cassandra, ....). Relatively easy.<p>3. Write your own stateful service.

10379221,comment,10378904,10378904,0,0,misja111,,,"I find the article a bit overoptimistic about the future and applicability of heterogenous computing.<p>The problem with delegating tasks to GPGPU&#x27;s is, that GPGPU cores can do only a very limited subset of what a CPU can do.<p>First of all, each GPGPU core has only a small amount of fast local memory available. In most applications, tasks need to be able to access databases, large in memory datastructures and what not. The GPGPU architecture is not designed for that. When data outside the core&#x27;s local memory is needed, data transfer to and from individual cores is costly and when too much of that has to happen, the benefit of the many GPGPU cores rapidly disappears.<p>Second, a GPGPU core does not have access to other components, e.g. IO controllers. So it can&#x27;t directly read from disk or write to the network. This again limits the types of work that a GPGPU core can do by a lot. For all network and disk access it needs to communicate with the CPU, and again, this communication is slow.<p>And finally there&#x27;s a difficulty of another nature. OpenCL or CUDA does not integrate nicely with higher level languages such as Java. The article mentions Aparapi, which is one solution that tries to deal with this by compiling Java code to OpenCL. The trouble with this is that Java code is living in another world as OpenCL; code that works well for Java might perform horribly on the GPGPU, because the GPGPU&#x27;s architecture with its memory locality is so different. So to write Java code that will be compiled to well performing OpenCL, you have to code it with OpenCL in mind, and you have to be aware of the manner in which Aparapi will convert your code to OpenCL. This defeats the purpose of Aparapi; it might very well be easier to just write your code in OpenCL so at least you have a clear view what is going on.",1444726511

It may be more academic kind of advances but things have trickled down to mainstream languages, e.g. F# and C# have had influences from Haskell (particularly because Simon Peyton-Jones is employed by Microsoft Research). Scala and other languages have had some influence too. Things such as Parser combinators have emerged from the Haskell world and have been adopted to many programming languages since.<p>Haskell is exciting because it takes a no-compromises approach to the paradigm it is based on. It&#x27;s purely functional and lazy, something not taken to such extremes in any prior languages. Whether this is the right(tm) approach to take is open to debate.<p>If I had to summarize in one sentence: Haskell is a research language that is practical - learning it will make you a better programmer even if you never get the opportunity to use it in your day job.",1444726463

You know how parents say they can tell by the cries of their baby what the baby needs? After the birth of our kid I found there is actually some truth to it. When he was hungry, he smacked his lips (like when sucking) and it made a mamamama sound, or myammyammyam or maybe even nomnomnom (overlaying the crying). When he had pain, it sounded more like auääää (excuse the umlaut) or auayyyy, due to the way he suddenly opened his mouth. I can imagine this is the source of expletives like Ouch or Aua in many languages. Now that he is a bit older (~10 months) he has more control over the sounds he makes, and is experimenting with speech, but the mamama and auäää seems to stick. Funnily, he seems to say &quot;daddy&quot; to me, although thats not the word in this region of the world (that would be papa) and I don&#x27;t know where he got it from. Also, its too early to tell if he is consciously using it for me or just experimenting with interesting sounds. I guess parents tend to overinterpret the first utterances of their kids a lot :-)",1444726201

There&#x27;s an overload for IEnumerable<double>. There&#x27;s no way to express &quot;is a number&quot; in C#, so it&#x27;s just special cased. In Haskell, however, there is:<p>sum :: (Num a) => [a] -> a<p>Which means: for any a which is a number, sum can be used to add up a list of as.<p>However, going back to the C# example, you&#x27;ll note we said IEnumerable<T>, not List<T>. In C#, the container is general, but in Haskell it&#x27;s specific. And since IEnumerable is an interface, this actually means &quot;any type that is enumerable&quot;. Haskell has an analogue of IEnumerable called Foldable.<p>So, what we _really_ wanted sum to say was &quot;sum is a function that, for any container f that is foldable, for any type a that is a number, takes an f of a and gives you an a&quot;.<p>sum :: (Foldable f, Num a) => f a -> a<p>This is the AMP style version of sum. Some people hate it, I love it.<p>However, there&#x27;s another piece of background to this that the email doesn&#x27;t mention: the Haskell Platform is under attack itself. There&#x27;s a new solution called stack which is, to my mind, easier to use and less likely to bite you with version conflicts. And whether HP should continue to be the &quot;default&quot; recommended way of starting with Haskell is, at best, controversial.<p>In short: there&#x27;s plenty of people who won&#x27;t miss his work on Haskell Platform, but losing Mark himself is a loss.",1444725390

For example, Onity/TESA door locks store an incrementing counter for determining the validity of keys. If you need to revoke a key, you make a new key with a higher counter value and insert it in each lock. When the lock sees a larger number, it increments its internal counter, and the old key will then have too small of a number and not work.<p>What&#x27;s even trickier is when you want thorough logging. Clipper terminals report back card usage information when they update on value adds. Some locks struggle with this - for Onity locks, retrieving user history requires connecting a bulky diagnostic device to the lock. An interesting solution is that used by Cyberlock. In that system, an audit log is stored in the key itself and the key has a short expiry, forcing the holder to frequently reprogram it, during which the log is retrieved. The locks must still store a log too in case of disappearing keys, but it allows for fairly accurate logging without frequently having to visit every lock.",1444725137

Online terminals, e.g. most vending machines, frequently synchronize with the online service and can transfer value added online almost immediately.

They leave advertisement cards on vehicles with tickets and indeed is how I learned of the service. The card states there&#x27;s an error with the ticket (regardless of whether there is ... every ticketed car will be canvased by Fixed). While I do believe they legitimately file a contest through the official channels, I don&#x27;t believe they expect or care to win the contest. Here&#x27;s why - by using the service you agree that Fixed will autopay on your behalf with a few-dollars service fee. I&#x27;m convinced their business model is fairly scammy in that they hook you with the promise that you&#x27;ve received an invalid ticket that can be dismissed. When in reality they know the majority of the tickets are valid, have no chance of dismissal, and reap the service charge you agree to when you file your contest with them.<p>Fixed is clearly not a sustainable business anyway - really, what percentage of tickets are not valid? A very small percentage I&#x27;m sure. And if their revenue is seriously modeled around winning contested invalid tickets then there is very little money to be made.<p>Edit - I missed the Founder David Hegarty reference.

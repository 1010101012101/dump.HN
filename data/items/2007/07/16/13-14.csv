One client saved nearly 100K/year by declaring a primary residence in another state (Wyoming). Does that actually mean he/she lives there?<p>Another thing - almost anyone who bought a modest house in a nice neighborhood in most of the bay area, los angeles, san diego, santa barbara... more than 15 years ago is probably a millionaire on paper.  I have a feeling a lot of these millionaire cash outs are retirees tapping home equity.<p>But are high tech entrepreneurs, flush with a mil from their first success, eager to leave silicon valley and resettle in Wyoming?  Seriously doubt it.<p>\n",1184592514

They are doing so well that they are already profitable after a year and trying to keep up with the demand.  I think I would really like working there, except that they use C++/Java.  I want to accomplish as much as possible in my life, and coding memory management in C++ or otherwise being limited to unexpressive languages just seems to prevent that goal.",1184592343

Sometimes it helps to have a second &#x27;junk&#x27; sheet to write notes down as you work on your primary copy. And of course your primary copy should only ever be a rough draft until after proper editing revisions.<p>Odds are you won&#x27;t cover everything, but don&#x27;t worry about that; you&#x27;re really just trying to give the person a bit of a head-start when they come in, once they are in they are going to do things their own way anyway.<p>Congratulations on the new position. :)",1404133184
7964785,comment,7963934,7964665,5,0,arethuza,,,"Actually, I think Banks does address some of those points - mostly by pointing out that if you do have a society where almost all reasonable requests can be satisfied by asking then the perceived value of &quot;owning&quot; something becomes negligible. You could make unreasonable requests, say to have planet built for you, but you&#x27;d have to ask a Mind for that and they might or might not do it - depending on how interesting the request was. (Given that the Culture regards planets as bit wasteful from an engineering perspective, I can&#x27;t imagine any self respecting Mind would build one).<p>Of course, the real get out, as Banks has pointed out a number of times - Culture people are <i>not</i> humans - they are the results of 10,000+ years of direct (genofixing) and indirect (their language Marain) manipulation by machines to be a good deal smarter, rational and more capable of enjoyment than we are. You could argue that this is the machine gods making their pets more compliant, or not....<p>Also, <i>Look to Windward</i> does mention &quot;re-inventing&quot; money... :-)",1404133182

7964754,comment,7963934,7964642,14,0,jerf,,,"In fact, I&#x27;d suggest even beyond that... just <i>think</i> about that claim. Love it or hate it or anything in between, wealth of <i>all</i> kinds has absolutely exploded under capitalism since the Industrial Revolution. If individual transactions in the world of capitalism are intrinsically exploitative and there is always a winner and a loser and a net loss of societal wealth... <i>how can you explain the modern world</i>, in which the poorest residents of the industrialized countries consider their birthright many things that the Kings of old could literally not have gotten at any price? Don&#x27;t just read the propaganda, <i>think</i>. This is self-evidently a ludicrous claim if you take it seriously. It is absurd that the net effect of multiple trillions (quadrillions?) of net-loss transactions could somehow sum to something so net positive. Bridge the gap between theory and reality... don&#x27;t just let people babble on and on about economics without ever asking them to be correct, <i>think</i> about what it would actually produce in the real world if it were true.<p>Capitalism has its problems. There may be better economic organizations. Capitalism may yet have a long term flaw in it as technology progresses (a lot of chatter about that case on HN in the past couple of years, there&#x27;s a lot of interesting questions there). There&#x27;s all sorts of avenues of &quot;attack&quot;, or, better yet, all sorts of ways to just <i>think</i> about where we&#x27;ve been, where we are, and where we&#x27;re going. However, it&#x27;s a sort of basic &quot;you must be at least this tall to ride the ride&quot; sort of thing that your theories must be able to explain how wealth has exploded under capitalism, and why it didn&#x27;t explode under the older systems, and why it doesn&#x27;t explode even more under any of the several attempts to use another system that have been really tried in the real world. (i.e., don&#x27;t try to claim that many of the obvious &quot;fixes&quot; to capitalism have never been tried when in fact they&#x27;ve all been tried numerous times, and so far have not generated the best track records. Theories should include and explain real-world data, not ignore it when it is convenient to do so.)<p>And should you be tempted to explain <i>away</i> the wealth, or claim with varying degrees of obfuscation that its distribution negates the wealth explosion entirely because it isn&#x27;t to your exact tastes (an obviously absurd claim when spelled out clearly but a popular dodge when slathered over with enough words to mask the logic), I strongly recommend spending some time with 18th century medical case notes, or reading about the opulence of 16th century royalty with an eye to what simple things we have today that they would (quite literally) kill for, or something else that will simply rub in your face how unbelievably <i>wealthy</i> we are today compared to the past. The past is <i>poor</i>. You can have theories about how it could be better, but if your theories become so powerful they explain why the wealth explosion didn&#x27;t happen at all, it&#x27;s time to throw the theory away and find a better one.<p>(Incidentally, I do have ways I&#x27;d improve things myself. If you&#x27;re reading this as a paean to the status quo and anyone criticizing it should just shut up, you&#x27;ve probably got a bad case of the propagandas rendering you unable to understand different ideas.

Surely the replicator has some advanced computation abilities, but theres no reason to think its any good at composing poetry, at all.  And given that assumption it piled on more assumption that &quot;turing tar pit like&quot; (my short analogy, not the essay) at attempt to simulate a human on top of a real non-human AI would be tremendously expensive, stacking high tech emulation on top of high tech emulation, such that Voyagers EMH was probably a terribly high cost (yet, sometimes useful...) appliance, so ships never used the Dr unless there was no choice.<p>How this fits in with the mobile emitter makes no sense.  Maybe the mobile emitter is the odd man out and should be de-cannonized.  If running the Dr costs as much as running the warp drive at a modest speed, the mobile emitter makes no sense as a concept.<p>TLDR is there is no obvious inherent scientific reason why a humanoid-like AI should scale technologically to be cheaper than flesh and blood.  &quot;cheap AI&quot; may very well be one of those classic math / logic / CS problems people bang their heads against walls for centuries, knowing it should be possible in theory or at least no known theory blocks the way, yet it never actually can be proven or implemented.",1404132000

I don&#x27;t think this got anywhere interesting though.<p>&quot;<i>a long, complicated journey as somethings become more abundant in some places, while other things are still scarce</i>&quot;<p>That&#x27;s an interesting thought. We have lots of examples of things suddenly becoming &#x27;abundant,&#x27; especially in the last few decades. If I was doing a meandering essay on this topic I&#x27;d make a list and see if there&#x27;s anything insightful to be learned from these. Maybe we can find a pattern.<p>Calories/grains are, for the wealthier half of the world are essentially abundant. Peasants were once the majority, producing and consuming grain as their primary economic activity. Today grains cost $200-$500 per ton. Median household income is in the $5k-$10k range. So half the world can have more grain than they can eat for <10% of their income.<p>Computers have various interesting examples of similar abundance.<p>The end result is interestingly similar in both cases. Our capacity to consume more quality is enormous. We feed grain to cattle to produce meat. It takes 5-10 grain calories to make  a calorie of meat, depending on the animal. We spent processing power to create user interfaces put personal computers in every pocket. More consumption. Higher quality.<p>This seems to follow standard economics. When goods get cheaper we consumer more, at higher quality and spend less. That concept seems to stretch pretty well. Even though calories and computing power are incredible cheap and abundant compared to their historical prices, we haven&#x27;t crossed our ability to consume more of them and &#x27;scarcity economics&#x27; doesn&#x27;t break.<p>If you go back to the industrial age or &quot;space age&quot; equivalents of this essay you will find fantastic parallels. <i>&quot;We can make so much stuff! So cheap! This will change everything!&quot;</i> There seems to be a common fallacy here. We look at a future of 10X efficiency and we underestimate our ability to consume more. Since we can&#x27;t consume 10X more goods, we assume that we&#x27;ll just work less. I think the tricky part is &#x27;quality.&#x27; You certainly can&#x27;t eat a ton of( $250) maize per day. But, you can easily spend $250 on food in a day. So, if you don&#x27;t want to look stupid in 100 years, be careful about predicting free time.<p>Here&#x27;s a question I would love to hear economists opines about: why don&#x27;t high earners work less. Say a Belgian lawyer makes €100,000 euros per year and a paralegal make €35,000. Why doesn&#x27;t the lawyer work fewer hours? Think of working hours as money and everything they buy as a good.  It appears that demand for &quot;goods&quot; as a whole is infinitely elastic. Make the goods half the price and homo economicus buys twice as much. Most markets are a lot more elastic than this one. Why?<p>If we saw some clear negative correlation between earnings per hour and hours worked (either at economy or individual level) we might be able predict see the path to a start trek economy of optional employment.<p>It might be worth going back to the beginning with this question. &quot;Why don&#x27;t people work less when they make more per hour.&quot;<p>^<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html</a>",1404131025

Moreover, tour buses driving mainland Chinese suits around open houses on their 2-3 day &quot;buy all!&quot; flash visits transformed from a one-off exotic thing to the routine. Local government doesn&#x27;t do a shit about this. They are happy as this feeds the construction industry, creates jobs and they also get to tax all these new developments. Their hand is stuck in a cookie jar. In the end all these buildings are just a way to park the foreign money and so the Vancouver housing bubble is tied directly to the state of Chinese economy. The only way for it to subside is for China to have an economic crisis.<p>It <i>is</i> a greater fool situation indeed, but regrettably it unfolds at a state level.",1404130945

I have miserably failed at finding my personal favorite article using Google, may have been pre-internet or dead tree only (anthology book essay topic?)<p>Anyway the one I&#x27;m looking for had an extremely detailed &quot;shopping list&quot; of everything ever mentioned in cannon trek series as of that time, and how much it cost in credits, and I don&#x27;t remember the exact spec but one credit seemed quite reasonable around one megawatt-hour, plus or minus a lot of star trek technology scaling.<p>It also had a lot of commentary about ratios between products and capital goods and stuff like that.<p>The kind of &quot;cash&quot; flow Quark had in credits seemed somewhat reasonable to run his vegas style establishment, plus or minus replicator charges especially for food.<p>The essay did discuss how the economic system didn&#x27;t seem to work numerically in general unless replicators squirted out free food on demand, or at least gave everyone a fixed caloric diet as a baseline and more credits for slightly fancier synthesis.<p>So federation people technically didn&#x27;t have money, as in tokens minted by a central bank to maximize wealth of the elite and obtain a semi-stable inflation rate at a cost of greatly increased economic cycle volatility.  But they did have money in that they bartered megawatt-hours of energy (presumably electricity) but called them credits.<p>If it helps anyone remember, the essay explained they called them credits instead of MWH or whatever because the exact amount of MWH was based on some tiny SI prefix of antimatter in a 100% efficient reactor (thermal, I guess) gives off about 1 MWH of total (heat) energy.  However, again, there is no such thing even in star trek world as a 100% efficient reactor and not everyone needs raw heat (although its handy) so they bartered energy as in megawatt-hours delivered.<p>In practice, any way to generate electricity, a reactor or a solar array or whatever, was a private mint.<p>This also explained some economics of star ship life, the ship itself actually generated &quot;pay&quot; for the crew right out of the reactor.<p>There was also some discussion in the essay about cross species, based on very limited evidence the Ferengi were fairly poverty stricken when comparing the average federation officer vs the average Ferengi when you analyze the somewhat theoretical accouting.<p>The essay did gloss over the Klingons... other than fealty labor I have no idea how they handled their economy and the essay I&#x27;m thinking of had no idea either.",1404130868

7964599,comment,7954266,7957330,2,0,arethuza,,,"Apologies for the delay in replying.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that I am in Edinburgh in the UK, which has an unusually high level of kids attending private education - roughly 25%. I don&#x27;t know about where you are, but because there are so many private schools here they effectively each target a different &quot;market&quot; - a lot of this is due to the level of fees which can vary from £10K to £30K a year. Certainly at the school our son attends (which is one of least expensive) most of the parents are either professionals or business people - although there are kids who have extremely wealthy parents they tend to be people who have made money in business rather than inheriting it.<p>The pros are pretty much what you would expect - first rate teachers, lack of &quot;problem&quot; kids (I went to one of the worst high schools in the UK, so I know what this can be like), first rate facilities, huge amount of support for activities outside class (sport, drama, cadets, music....). The focus on kids being physically healthy is noticeable as well - although whether you regard this as a good or bad thing depends on what your kid wants.<p>Cons - it is expensive, and the fees are only the start, I would say it is easily 25% to 50% on top of the fees for all of the &quot;extras&quot;. To be honest, we haven&#x27;t seen that many cons but I&#x27;ve known people who have had problems with kids at the same school if they didn&#x27;t find their niche to excel at - the culture seems to be that if you excel at <i>something</i> either academically and/or sporting (they are not viewed as mutually exclusive, which is a good thing) then you get respect from peers and teachers - the question is making sure you have <i>something</i> you excel at.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how they do it, but private schools, at least here in the UK, do seem to instill a huge amount of self confidence in kids, which is probably the most valuable character trait you can have.",1404129702

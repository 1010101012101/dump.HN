Every time you run the test suite, you are outsourcing to the test suite the task of running through your mental model of the program and thinking ""what did I break"".<p>The limitation of TDD is that it blocks rapid iteration in what the program <i>should</i> do. When you load the entire model of the program into your head, requirements change at the speed of thought. With TDD, they change at the speed of a lot of reading and typing.",1354964378

Also, people generally go overboard with the ""commenting"" part -- the purpose is to be pseudocode in the way Python is executable pseudocode, while retaining the ambiguity that is necessary for natural language to be natural.

Processes in the real world are composed of 1-* sub-processes, and ultimately distill down into transformations (input -> transformation -> output).<p>You don't need to understand every low-level process to make a start.<p>You raise two interesting points though. Yes, revisiting an architecture is required when you've not solved a similar problem before. Consider though that in this community 99.9% of the time others have solved your problem before. You could reinvent the wheel (which is arrogant), or you could do some research to see which architecture has been successful for others.<p>Sure, that means doing some work before writing code which seems decidedly unpopular these days. It's a free world.<p>You also say that it's a lot of hard work. Yes.

There's no getting around this.<p>I can't tell you how many programs I've seen where the wrong abstraction is never perturbed, and as a result all feature development pays a huge cost in reliability and functionality.<p>To create or change an abstraction, you have to get your mind around all sides of it.  That requires A LOT of context.  You should always be ""revisiting your architecture"".  It's basically never true that the first architecture works, unless you've written an extremely similar program before.  The worst programs result when people are afraid to shift boundaries.  That happens a lot in big company development that PG talks about -- each team just accumulates crud on their side of the abstraction boundary, but they never talk to each other so they can globally simplify.<p>It's true that abstraction reduces complexity, and thus is the only way you can build big programs, but it takes a lot of hard work to get there.",1354963044

Which is also the issue that startups face, when they are funded by US based VC Firms cause they are expected to act and deliver like US based startups - fast, quick, wham-bham customers who come and leave, but still ""acquiring"" them is what investors care for.<p>Its a long story.

We already have 25 Linux machines and a few postgres machines in production. They all run OpenJDK on them and infrastructure items such as memcached, Postgres, couple of MQ solutions. That and we've thrown TFS out, moved to mercurial+JIRA, have Eclipse on more workstations than visual studio and are not renewing our partner package next year.<p>This is what happens when you treat your customers like shit and force them through costly audits so they can pay you more money for not understanding very ambiguous license terms.",1354960977

Sure, everyone knows that marketing is critical, but when it comes time to experience it first hand, it gets you to a deeper level of appreciation for the fact.<p>Like you said, word of mouth is the best marketing approach if you can achieve it. I can think of three ways to get there:<p>- Viral Features: The most know examples are social networks and other social Web sites, but there are many others that aren't exactly social but they do have viral features. For example, Paypal. If you want to send money to someone, they'll have to create a Paypal account as well.<p>- A Well Known Brand: That's obvious. If you're a big company or a well known celebrity in the tech industry everyone will be happy to cover your news. If you don't have a well known brand, then try to associate yourself with someone who does.<p>- A WOW feature: Anything that amazes people and gets them to tell their friends about your product falls under this category. The first thing that comes to mind is Google Maps. When it first came out it was so amazing that everyone called their friends to show them.<p>P.S. I'd like to read your essay when you finish it.

36117,story,,,5,8,mynameishere,"Question: Do any of you use a software engineering ""process""?",,"I've been involved in different kinds of software processes, and the most effective for small projects seems to be:<p>1. Talk generally about what we want to achieve.<p>2. Mock up some screens.<p>3. Agree on relevant technologies (language, platform, data store).<p>4. Assign responsibilities.<p>5. Commence.<p>\nNeedless to say, this is not your typical ""big company"" software process. I've also been involved in more complicated processes that would involve multi-month-long documentation orgies, in which 50-150 page requirements and design documents would be made, remade, and remade (often for code that would total less than a thousand lines, and that was conceptially just a CRUD app).<p>Can any of you small-company types describe your process, if any? What is most effective for you?",1185205814

36115,comment,36060,36113,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"No, whether you yourself want it doesn't enter into it, although I do agree with the premise that it is easier to build something people want if you yourself want it too.<p>What I meant was that you built something people wanted, but 100 other startups built it too, and in such a way that they all are indistinguishable from the user's perspective.  In this case, the users may indeed want what you built, but they just may end up getting it from someone else, i.e. ""not from you.""<p>Generally, I think a reasonable amount of competition actually helps a startup.  But if you are essentially identical to 100 other startups, I think you have entered into a crap shoot trap.  Perhaps a few of the 100 will ultimately be successful, perhaps none.  <p>The way I look at it, I think it is a real trap when the likes of Yahoo and Google are falling into it and shutting down services they had previously created for lack of ""traction in the marketplace.""  If their kind of seed traffic and press edge can't push them to the forefront, you can bet the standard marketing plan--submit to press/blogs/whatever and get some buzz with the early adopting tech-crowd and then raise advertising money to ""cross the chasm"" into the mass market--is equivalent to a lottery.<p>\n",1185205649
36114,comment,35015,35015,0,0,SK,,,"These comments are very confusing. Paul -- a simple question: doesn't the amount of capital offered/invested have a big impact on the calculation? Sure I'd give up 6% of my pre-natal company for $1 million. But would I for $1 thousand? No. Doesn't your analysis suggest that in both cases the calculation is 1/(1-n)? Yet the ability to add 6.4% value at exit given $1 million is vastly different than if given $1 thousand...\n",1185205403

36112,comment,35972,36079,0,0,bls,,,"I don't know your business too well, but I would be really surprised if that was the motivation for your customers. Most business people are trying to improve productivity in their main business to improve their main business, not make time for a second business. Plus, why would somebody looking to start a startup spend money on expensive software--wouldn't they save their money to invest in the startup?<p>",1185204872

It created incentives to build out the types of networks that require massive cap-ex (cellular, TV broadcast). <p>If no one built these in the first place, we wouldn't have anything to build ""open access"" on. <p>Regulation turns out to be a bad thing when it turns into a function of political favors vs. public interest.<p>As with most things in life, regulation is good in moderation.

How can the two possibly be correlated?""<p>Since you are asking for a possible explanation, and not a provable one:<p>People with lots of good things to say naturally seek out places where what they say is not drowned out by meaningless noise.  This means that whenever a new publishing medium is established, they jump on it in order to say their good things before Zynga figures out how to use it to broadcast pleas for help milking virtual cows or whatever.",1301720357

2399220,comment,2398989,2398989,4,0,rosenjon,,,"Bought a Mac off Craigslist a year and a half ago to do development for iPhone; it was a beat up MacBook Pro 15"" from 2006 with slightly messed up screen (backlighting was uneven). However, it was a good deal compared to a new Mac ($600).<p>It turned out I ended up using the Mac much more than my Windows machine. Why? Because it would come back from sleep in < 15 seconds, whereas my Lenovo would sometimes take 5 min to come back from sleep. Also, Windows would sometimes reboot my machine in the middle of coding a project. It had apparently ""warned me"" with some difficult to see message, and then just started shutting down my machine with no significant prompt. It would then sometimes hang in the update process, forcing a hard reboot and then another 10 min wait for startup. This was Win 7, mind you.<p>I took a nice paying dev project back in October, with the intention of using it to buy myself a new machine. I ended up buying a new MacBook Pro 15"" with the anti-gloss screen and on the higher end of the hardware specs. Am in love with the computer. One of my housemates asked if he could borrow my Windows machine for an Excel class this weekend; I handed it over without hesitation. Haven't turned it on in months.<p>I originally thought I would have to install Parallels or boot camp when I first got my new Mac, not wanting to have to parallel path with the a separate Windows machine. In truth, I haven't ever installed any of these options. With Mac Office 2011, 99% of what I need to do is available. In the rare case when it's not, I may boot up the Windows machine for a one-off look at an Excel spreadsheet or something like that.<p>If I were MSFT, I would be worried. Around campus, the Apple logos outnumber the Macs in a big way these days. Two years ago, this was not the case. I'm a business school student, and Windows has always had significant crossover on campus from the corporate world. Our official school laptop is the Lenovo I don't use anymore.<p>Windows was always kind of a pain, but the variety of software available for it gave it tremendous leverage. I was a Mac addict as a kid, all the way up to around Windows 95, when it just became impossible to continue supporting the platform; the ecosystem had wilted at that point to a shadow of its former self. I have basically been on Windows since then, until the recent switch back to Mac.<p>Windows continues to ride the legacy train all the way to the graveyard. You can't do as bad of a job as MSFT has done in terms of maintaining a core platform and expect to maintain market share. Everyone from the CEO down should have been fired for Vista. Win 7 is basically the maintenance release that Vista should have been. In the meantime, the Mac has exceeded it by leaps and bounds.",1301720323

In India, if you don't bribe, you won't get the service you need and are entitled to.<p>I can give examples, but HN's disks may overflow.<p>For example: to get a passport, you need a certificate of residency (or something like that, it's been a while) from the local police station. Unless you bribe the cops there, they'll never mail it in.<p>Basically, in India, every touchpoint of the government machinery has a bribe slot. If you ever need a service from the government, you need to pay up. It simply does not matter how deserving your case is. There are examples aplenty of old pensioners having to bribe the pension officers to collect their own pensions!<p>Corruption is a cruel system that abuses the most vulnerable and weak in society. The rich can use it to their advantage, and hence they don't care (one neighbor of ours became a multi-millionaire by bribing and selling sub-standard equipment to the Indian Railways ).

I read with envy all of the HN posts about morning pages, getting up early with a cup of joe to be productive, etc. I am usually a groggy mess in the morning.<p>When I learned that you could time sleep cycles to reduce sleep intertia by waking up in between cycles, I immediately saw how it could help my life. Originally, I had written a shell script to help me personally (refre.sh to wake up refreshed), but it was difficult to distribute and my friends on a non-unix based OS couldn't use it at all.<p>I had recently been wanting to try my hand at developing web applications, and had decided to try jQuery. I am a security engineer and most of the code I write is for backend systems; basically, I'm <i>not</i> a design guy.<p>I learned jQuery and created sleepyti.me initially as a 'weekend project' (which, way back when, HN and reddit.com/r/web_design gave me feedback on) which I then expanded on until it was something I liked. I'm now in the final stages of developing an iPhone app (because of incessant demand via email) and soon Android, Windows Phone 7 and Blackberry versions.<p>The money comes in because of the traffic I've gotten. Someone (not me) submitted sleepyti.me to StumbleUpon very early in the site's lifecycle, and it has been quite popular there. I put a Facebook Like button on the page to try to drive the site socially/virally/""organically"". This brought me between 10-15k hits a day -- a lot for a weekend project.<p>About two months after launch, someone (not me) submitted to Reddit's Today I Learned subreddit (regarding sleep inertia), which drove 250k+ hits in one day. After this event, my daily hits started averaging around 30k hits per day, which is where they are stable now.<p>Although obviously only a tiny amount of viewers click my banner ad, with an overall traffic amount this large there are bound to be people interested in whatever Adsense has spewing up. Additionally, I only show my banner ad after the calculation has occurred, so viewers don't have to suffer through ads. I've gotten emails from Google (automated of course) advising me to increase the banner count on the site, but I don't want to further bother viewers. If they're interested, they click; if not, no pressure.<p>My eventual goal would be to sell dedicated ad slots to an interested party (for example, a mattress chain that wants my visitors, or an alarm clock manufacturer, etc) or to sell the site at large to one of these entities. I'm not actively marketing it, however, and don't really even know how I'd go about it.<p>Not sure that you were looking for quite so in-depth of a reply, but I wanted to explain myself as I also saw another posting asking about the profit. Don't worry, I'm not a link spammer :)<p>Edit: As I seem unable to reply to the reply to this post, I will answer here. The 30k/day is from varied sources, as reddit traffic is generally short lived. I imagine that some of my 'dedicated audience' is from reddit, but a lot of it is users that found it shared on Facebook or located it via StumbleUpon.",1301718847

If you liked Founders at Work, you'll like this one (although the two aren't affiliated). I'll post it on Hacker News when it's ready, hopefully sometime next weekend. I haven't talked to anyone about it yet, but mainly because I've been busy with it (much greater time commitment than I had anticipated).",1301718765

For example, I taught myself jQuery by creating <a href=""http://sleepyti.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sleepyti.me</a> -- which is now profitable enough to pay my rent.<p>If you don't have an immediate need for software -- whether it be a webapp, or (more likely with Python) a script that organizes files on a *nix system, you have two viable choices: open source contributions or 'challenges'.<p>Open source contribution is by far the best way to propel yourself into software development, but the problem is that it can be very advanced for the neophyte programmer. If you can find a project to take you under their wing, that's awesome; more likely, you can set this as an eventual goal of your programming experience.<p>A second choice that I personally have found intriguing is the 'challenge' approach. Completing challenges such as Project Euler or various Code Katas that you can find (don't worry if they're in another language specifically, you can simply use your language of choice to complete them) shows progress and presents you with real, challenging scenarios to deal with. Code Katas tend to let you learn the language most practically, where as Project Euler problems are generally more math and algorithm-development based. Either way, these challenges are fun and generally rewarding.<p>I wish you luck on your question to master software development; there are few feelings in the world as satisfying as creating a useful, clean piece of software.",1301716899

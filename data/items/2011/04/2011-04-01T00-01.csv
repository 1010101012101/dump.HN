2394481,comment,2391049,2392968,3,0,alexqgb,,,"If that's what you believe, fine.<p>The sketchy thing is supporting your (presumably well-considered) position with manipulative appeals to un-reason. The ""how would YOU feel if [insert random horror here] happened to you or your loved ones?"" tactic is one of the worst examples going. Using it is a good reason for downvoting.<p>The whole point of policy making is to get beyond the (obviously) tortured perspective of a few unfortunates, and ask if the kind of strong emotional reaction these stories provoke will actually lead to sensible policy.<p>The less likely the actual horror is, the more likely the answer is 'No.' It's just as likely that those closest to the horror will reject this sober and well-considered response, and start spreading hysteria and fear instead, while totally ignoring any negative side-effects that get included in the more rational assessments they're trying to undermine.<p>By the way, being ""close to the horror"" doesn't necessarily mean being a victim. It can also mean being in a position to profit from hysterical over-reactions. When this starts to happen, you really start to see the Shirkey Principle in action. Namely, ""every institution will seek to preserve the problem for which it is the solution.""",1301619580
2394480,comment,2393844,2393844,1,0,meric,,,"I've been trying to achieve this same effect (without this library of course...) I had links pointing to the 'full page' but used jquery to override the click event of the link so that they used ajax to download only a part of the page into a container. Which container, is determined by the javascript, which I <i>carefully</i> write to avoid confusing myself. Which body part to download was determined by the server. I did not have to duplicate my html; The body part was a template by it self, and included by a master template for the full page. When a body part was downloaded, some jquery javascript needed to be re-run. (e.g. $(x).accordion()) Depending on the url, either the full page or just the body part was served.<p>On incompatible browsers the javascript functionality did not activate and clicking on the links led to the full versions of the page.<p>Maybe this library can save me some headache.",1301619558

The ""maximum amount you would pay for this meal"" suggests the meal's value to you.<p>However, for all K=# of seats, his Kth-price auction does not have the property that inputting your truthful value is your dominant strategy. The price should really be the bid of the K+1th person--otherwise, the Kth person can lower his bid in any outcome to the K+1th price/value (in descending order) and still obtain the seat. So it is not even a Nash Equilibrium to submit your truthful value.<p>So let's see how we can make the auction consistent with the desire to get everyone to bid their truthful value.

I had no problems and loved the experiences I had with all of them. The only issue I know of was someone who was a bit rude to one of her hosts because she was prejudiced against staying with someone older than 20.

It won't be for everyone, or at least the shared spaces may not be for everyone. I have been a huge fan of AirBnB since I learned of them because I think they provide a great (superior to couchsurfing) platform for finding and evaluating hosts and they take away the many of the weird rules that many couchsurfing hosts developed to allow someone to stay with them. They made it financially beneficial to hosts who are providing a great service and seem to have a great support system in place in addition to their information on using the site successfully.

The Republicans elected to Congress had a choice between two budget bills, one of which spent $30 billion less. Following the will of the voters who granted them a historic electoral sweep in November, they chose to pass the smaller one. The decision to cut these particular programs was made by one of the hundreds of lobbyists, aides, and government agency employees that had a hand in writing the bill.<p>The congress people who voted for the cuts did not go down the list of federal programs making cost/benefit analyses to decide which programs to cut. Rather, they were presented a large package and asked to make a yes or no decision. Politics is not as rational as the rest of the entries in this discussion imply.<p>These information programs are tiny for now (though federal programs have a way of metastasizing) and they probably provide more benefit than cost. It is a bad policy decision to cut them, but if the alternative is making no cuts to the budget then the whole package may be worth it.<p>I agree that $30 billion of cuts does next to nothing to shrink the deficit. Sadly, there is little momentum behind my man Rand Paul’s proposal to cut $500 billion, or Paul Ryan’s roadmap to reduce future Social Security and Medicare deficits. The Republican leadership is playing budget theatre, passing tiny cuts that make them look good without touching the politically sensitive programs that really need shrinking. On the other hand the Democrats are playing budget denial, fighting to keep and expand every line item on the budget. Neither approach is very appealing to me.

ActiveInbox is a lot of UI enhancements to create a new way of controlling your email, but it does it all with a clever use of Gmail's labels.<p>The only thing that relies upon the server is if you're a Plus user (including the free trial), to store your preferences on our server; and to store 'Conversation Notes'  (a text box at the top of all conversations for planning next actions, a quick memo of what the entire thread is about, and links to related information if needed).<p>We are trying to figure out a way to do Conversation Notes purely with IMAP, but we haven't got a really fast/reliable idea yet, so we're sticking with our own servers.<p>But yes - for everything that is important to your organization, it's all labels.",1301616279

An animal that was going to be destroyed anyways.<p>In my opinion, Bob Parsons did nothing wrong, even if I wouldn't have posted a video about it.  Heck, I also wouldn't have killed the animal.  But to attempt to blame him to poaching and historical racism (the great white hunter line) seems a little out there.<p>Do you have any evidence that the legal killing, in this manner, actually has any affect on wildlife populations?  Any reason to think that it actually does provide cover (data reasons rather than anecdotes)?<p>Again, it's not something that I would do, or even something that I approve.

Otherwise Twitter wouldn't be writing things like this in their blog:<p><i>We believe there are still significant benefits to increasing awareness of what’s happening outside the home timeline. Evidence of the incredibly high usage metrics for the QuickBar support this.</i><p>'Incredibly high usage metrics' - sounds pretty good for the purchasers of their sponsored trends, no?<p>Now, Twitter <i>could</i> be lying about the Dickbar's usage, but I doubt it.  Lying involves conspiracy.  It sledgehammers the morale of honest employees.  The truth's likely to leak.  The leadership of Twitter's not that stupid - if they mention incredibly high usage metrics, it's because there were incredibly high usage metrics.<p>So, if Dickbar was great for monetization, why remove it?    I suspect it got yanked because it conflicted with a higher priority - control over the client.  If the vast majority of users love the Dickbar, but a small sliver of people were turned off enough by it to start using an alternate client, that throws the Tweetdecks of the world a lifeline at a time when Twitter would rather they drown.<p>After the Tweetdecks have transitioned to enterprise tools or simply given up, <i>then</i> Twitter can launch Son of Dickbar.  Until then, growing client market share is way, way more important than prematurely boosting monetization.  It's not like Twitter lacks access to capital.",1301616113

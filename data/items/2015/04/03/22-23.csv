Neodymium is no \n   rarer than copper or nickel and quite evenly distributed throughout the \n   world’s crust. While China produces 90% of the global market’s neodymium, \n   only 30% of the world’s deposits are located there. Arguably, what makes it, \n   and cerium, scarce enough to be profitable are the hugely hazardous and \n   toxic process needed to extract them from ore and to refine them into usable \n   products. For example, cerium is extracted by crushing mineral mixtures and \n   dissolving them in sulphuric and nitric acid, and this has to be done on a \n   huge industrial scale, resulting in a vast amount of poisonous waste as a \n   byproduct. It could be argued that China’s dominance of the rare earth \n   market is less about geology and far more about the country’s willingness to \n   take an environmental hit that other nations shy away from.\n</code></pre>\nie the rare earths minerals aren&#x27;t rare, just very toxic to extract",1428101838

I would lie completely still on my bed in the evening, meditating until I started to drift off. First I&#x27;d feel my body go numb. Then I&#x27;d hear either a round of explosions or a roaring rush of wind. If I managed not to get too excited, I&#x27;d cross over into dream, fully cognizant of what had happened. I had one experience with sleep paralysis under similar circumstances: during one of these sessions, I was sure I had pulled myself out of the dream, but I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes or move my legs. This lasted for about thirty seconds before control abruptly snapped back. I&#x27;m still not entirely sure whether this happened mid- or post-dream, but it certainly felt real in a way dreams never did for me.<p>All in all, it was fun to experiment with for a while.

9319061,comment,9314155,9316852,0,0,dubyah,,,"No, the reason why is because the F-35 is a multi-service and multi-national project. Couple that with large production numbers trying to leverage the advantages from economies of scale, you have a very heavy program. \nIt&#x27;s strange how many people hold the F-35 as solely the Air Force&#x27;s fault when considering the branches and countries involved and especially considering how much the STOVL requirement on the part of the Marines compromised the design for all other variants.<p>The whole F-35 vs A-10 satisfies a lot of tropes; government bureaucracy gone wild, old vs new, Air Force doesn&#x27;t care about CAS, etc..<p>The fact is, guided munitions have changed the nature of close air support to the point that most CAS missions have been performed by other aircraft for a number of years now. The A-10 operates well in such asymmetrical environments as seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the Air Force concern is towards less permissive environments and having an inventory of planes that can multitask vs single-task. The A-10 has always been known to operate only in permissive environments and MANPADS are an emerging threat (Su-25 in Ukraine, for example). Yes, the A-10 is highly survivable, but there is case to be made in not being hit in the first place.<p>I would prefer if they kept the A-10 (and to be honest, prefer if they start fielding A-29 or some other LAS/LAAR craft in such permissive environments), but their argument against the A-10 (essentially, &quot;we prefer to keep it, but other aircraft can do a pretty good role and it&#x27;s cheaper to abandon it&quot;) isn&#x27;t without merit.",1428101562

Most/all x86 instruction sets from SSE and onward are very RISC-like (and theses provide most of the chip&#x27;s power). If we move back from these problem types to look at something like coremark, then MIPS has the highest coremark/MHz score.<p>A more interesting question is that of the resources required to compete. In 2013, Intel spent 10 Billion in R&D while it&#x27;s closest competitor (Qualcomm) spent 3 Billion (in fact, Intel spent more than the next four companies put together -- lest you argue about fabs, TSMC spent only 1.6 Billion).

9319024,comment,9308993,9314059,0,0,jqm,,,"Interesting article. I would note a couple of points though...<p>1)Notice the drywall collapsing? That&#x27;s what is going to happen to a person getting shot at close range with a 12 gauge.. even with birdshot. It would be something like getting smacked with a sledgehammer. I&#x27;m less interested in penetrating vitals than flat out knocking the person down. A person who&#x27;s arm, or even lungs are penetrated cleanly by a high caliber round might still be functional for a bit... functional enough to shoot back.<p>2)Even though the #4 buck did penetrate multiple layers of drywall in this guys test, what is the lethality after 2 or 3 layers? You say yourself that #4 buck is less likely to penetrate vitals in the first place. Your 45 on the other hand will likely easily penetrate multiple layers of drywall, then completely penetrate the person on the other side.<p>Anyway, different strokes and all that. A firearm is a good home defense weapon in general. Always nice to meet another person who doesn&#x27;t feel owning a firearm makes one a Neanderthal of some kind. Where I live, I wouldn&#x27;t be without one in the home. I sleep much better at night and feel I could protect my girlfriend and our belongings against invasion.<p>I also have a number of other firearms including military type rifles, hunting rifles and some handguns, but the shotgun is the one I keep in bedroom for defense.",1428101020

I wasn&#x27;t even thinking of Ruby in that list, and I definitely wasn&#x27;t including the new kids on the block (Rust, Go, Elixir, etc.) I&#x27;m not trying to get into a huge argument about what is a major language -- this is just a rough list that I had in my head and not something I&#x27;m set on.<p>Of those, the newest (PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby) are now 20 years old.<p>I&#x27;m certain that none those came with the important usability features we think of now. I&#x27;d also like to think that the science around programming has improved in 20+ years, and we&#x27;re designing better languages in the 2010s than we were in the 1990s.<p>Again, this isn&#x27;t just about syntax or the standard library. The docs and tools around the languages above are mature now, but they didn&#x27;t start out that way. Rust is interesting because, unlike any of those languages, it&#x27;s trying to start out with the mature docs and tools we expect in 2015.<p>And although I can&#x27;t speak for them, everything I&#x27;ve read suggests that Go was <i>not</i> primarily designed to be usable. The creators intentionally left things out (generics are the obvious example) in their attempt to favor simplicity over usability.

[The unitary executive theory holds that a powerful president controls the entire executive branch.] That&#x27;s the policy recommendation and the conclusion that the Constitution is largely, not entirely, but largely irrelevant. Now, I say what I&#x27;ve said about the Constitutional matter with considerable regret. I wish it weren&#x27;t so. The executive department&#x27;s vision of the Constitution, with the president on top and the administration below, has elegance and simplicity and tremendous appeal. It would make much more sense, I submit, given our current situation, to have a Constitution in which the president is on top of administration is below. But that was not the founder&#x27;s original conception. The Constitution does not speak in those terms…. Because the conclusion that I&#x27;ve reached seems to me so unfortunate, I&#x27;m trying hard to figure out what can be done about it…. One thing that perhaps can be done about it is to say, well, we shouldn&#x27;t really be originalists about the meaning of the Constitution. Maybe Judge Bork had wrong. Maybe we should think that the Constitution has a high degree of flexibility. Maybe it&#x27;s a changing and living document.

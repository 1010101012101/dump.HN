Do they share your same views, or different views?<p>They might shed some more light on the situation.  Hypothetically:  ""Oh, yeah, Joe's a great guy, but you're right.  He doesn't really get the 10,0000ft view of things.  He mentioned to me the other week that it hasn't really been explained to him clearly, so he just focuses on the task at hand.  He doesn't get all of that business stuff either, and really doesn't want to embarrass himself by admitting it.""<p>----------<p>His motivations, and incentives to work, might be different than you think too.  Usually you really have to get to know someone, both at work and in their personal life, to truly understand what drives them.  Money isn't always everything.<p>Maybe he's offloading work to other teammates so he can work on his startup instead, on the job!  ;)<p>----------<p>But as others have said, it's great that you're friends!  :)  Talk to him about it in a non-threatening way (I know that's tricky sometimes).  Ask him how he feels about things.<p>If you do the ""we're going to have a manager/employee review"" thing, and it comes off negatively from his perspective, that'll probably scare him.  When people are scared they can become unpredictable.<p>He might start working harder, he might start looking for another job, he might complain to HR and fight back, etc...

Having a uniform system of accumulating scores on class work to set a course grade, as the author of the submitted article suggests, leaves a lot of important improvements undone. How does any outside observer know whether, for example, Podunk High School or Elite Prep Academy has a chemistry class that really covers the fundamental principles of secondary-education-level chemistry? How does an outside observer know whether an English teacher grades mostly on the basis of thoughtful argumentation and carefully chosen content, or on neatness and spelling only?<p>Any reform of school grading will be hard put to eliminate the role of standardized testing for precisely this reason. Harvard's dean of admission recently commented on this:<p>""Q: You recently lead a high-profile commission that recommended de-emphasizing the SAT and ACT from admission requirements. A number of colleges have already made the tests optional. Do you see this ever happening at Harvard?<p>""A: We do not foresee a time that Harvard would be test optional. Only a few years ago we were receiving applications from about 5,000 high schools each year and now the number has grown to over 8,000. We need some common yardsticks that enable us to gauge in a rough way what is being learned in an ever-increasing and diverse high school context, not to mention the increasing number of students who are home-schooled.<p>""We continue to believe that the College Board's Subject Tests, along with either the SAT or ACT with the writing tests, allow students the best opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned thus far. Advanced placement and international baccalaureate results are also helpful.""<p><a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2009/02/24/5_questions_for_harvards_admissions_dean/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2009/02...</a>",1236198106

They read.<p>The main problem with having no TV is the risk of it becoming forbidden fruit in the kid's mind and thus becoming <i>more</i> attractive. We hit, inadvertently, on a nice solution to this: we always had a TV around, just a really crappy one. It was rarely on. The kids were welcome to watch TV at friends' houses or their grandparents'. At home, that time mostly went into reading or playing.<p>Edit: I don't recall any evidence that they felt socially out of step with TV-watching peers. I do remember that when Power Rangers were a huge deal, our daughter became passionate about Power Rangers, so we always let her watch it. Then one day she said: ""I don't care about Power Rangers any more. The story is always the same."" That was a proud day in the gruseom household! :)",1236198059

We like us all, we are all friends and like working together, but I have a problem with one of them. He likes his job, and he tries to do his best, but he just doesn't seem to get the 10000ft view of things, and loses himself in unimportant stuff, so other team members sometimes have to do his work for him, or help him out on all kinds of stuff, not allowing them to get on with their work (which they are best at).
How do you handle these situations? Should I alienate him and get him out of the group, looking for someone else to do his job? Or should I try to explain the situation to him? What do you think?",1236196801

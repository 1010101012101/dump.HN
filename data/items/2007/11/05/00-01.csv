I personally know of one incident (at a major data center) where some bad guys stole a bunch of super valuable gear by lowering it out of a window down to street level.\n",1194222266

76149,comment,76077,76077,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Hmm. Interesting idea, but I see several extremely big problems. <p>First, you're relying on patients to triage themselves and determine if their condition is life-threatening. You do not emphasize that the service is for CLEARLY non-life-threatening problems. It should have a huge banner that lists some symptoms and says to call 911 or drive to the ER immediately. Maybe there should be a system for a triage nurse to monitor the ""symptoms"" of the people who sign up and call them if he/she thinks it's serious.<p>Second, if someone signs up and doesn't think their illness is life-threatening and then dies, you/your company can be potentially liable for that. I have a feeling insuring yourself against that will be expensive.<p>Third, the brand is really horrible and the site isn't exactly easy to navigate. But you mentioned you need a UI designer (I emailed you), so at least you seem to recognize that.<p>Fourth, I would not pay 25 dollars for this service. Maybe you can work out a deal with the hospital to pull this fee out of the flat ER cost. That would be awesome and you'd have tons and tons of people use the system, especially if it's well advertised at the hospital.<p>The idea is cool and for major trauma centers in metropolitan areas where the wait can be greater than 7-10 hours, it could be extremely valuable. <p>\n",1194221424

76146,comment,76007,76128,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I never thought of it as functional - looked more like little islands of imperative programming to me (I guess I will have to check again). <p>I think fast interpreted is probably even overstating it, it makes all sorts of compromises. Erlang was also designed for very high availability  - so that must cost something as well. <p>I guess we will see what happens, but I am very skeptical about erlang (not sure why, just a gut feel).

Try linking with a backend.\nMake sure you do these small things properly , not just thinking its too easy.\nThe things like this will help you with confidence, once you  finish up with your site , add more functionality to it . Use JavaScript , make your page dynamic. Try using javascript to just make small things.\nOnce you are fully done with these go in for python/ruby.There are really good tutorials out there.Implement a small thing and post it here .

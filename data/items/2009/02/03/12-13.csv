His comment on this: ""My name is on the book and it represents exactly my opinions. I would not have a book issued in my name that I do not 100 per cent agree with. I needed someone to do the actual writing because I’m 84 and that was Roy Varghese’s role. The idea that someone manipulated me because I’m old is exactly wrong. I may be old but it is hard to manipulate me. That is my book and it represents my thinking."" I don't see any credible way to interpret that other than as admitting that he didn't actually write the book.<p>You may define ""science"" in such a way as to make every philosopher a ""scientist"" if you wish. For that matter, you may define it so as to make every banana a ""scientist"". However, if you want to communicate with other people then I recommend that you use words in something like the same sense as others do. Antony Flew is not a scientist.",1233665990

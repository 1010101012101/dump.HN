4590315,comment,4588053,4588826,28,0,markdotto,,,"Hey Bryan, good to hear from you again. It's been roughly two years since we even spoke to each other, let alone saw each other in public. Before I dive into it, I have always and will continue to always have nothing but the best wishes for ZURB. Now, to get to it.<p>You did teach me a lot, Bryan, and I know the (edit: removed the number) ex-ZURBians would agree with you on that. You taught me about design process, design thinking, and how to communicate well with clients and other designers. Moreover, if you hadn't brought me out to California, I wouldn't be where I am today. Thanks again for that, I really do owe you one there. You taught us a lot more, but we don't need to go into that as I'm sure everything that drove us away has changed for the better.<p>Yes, Bootstrap emerged from my work at ZURB, but more importantly, from the entire web community. Before I redesigned ZURB.com or wrote nearly the entire ZURB Style Guide (at least the CSS and Design Patterns sections), frameworks and style guides were already in high demand and influencing our work at ZURB. You can take a look at the CSS section here: <a href=""http://d.pr/i/uoGb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.pr/i/uoGb</a>. I have screenshots of every page of the project from right before I left.<p>It's important to note that <i></i>I never worked on Foundation<i></i>, nor had any idea it was in the works until it was released on 10/14/2011, two months after Bootstrap was released (<a href=""https://twitter.com/ZURB/status/124984359135608832"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/ZURB/status/124984359135608832</a>). In fact, it was Dave Gamache, former ZURB designer and now former Twitter designer, who wrote a majority of Foundation 1.0 <i></i>after I left ZURB<i></i>. Go ahead and ask him (@dhg) about that for more details.<p>However, I did copy and paste code, but never from Foundation. The things Bryan is referring to are ""how to"" docs, lorem ipsum and filler text, and examples for the address tag, emphasis tags, lists, and blockquotes. Looking at the very first commit to Bootstrap (<a href=""https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/eb81782cdbdc68aaebe4fa561b5fbb73ef866611"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/eb81782cdbdc68aaeb...</a>), four months before we released v1.0, you can see that content there. I have made no attempt to hide it, nor could I. In the hundreds of following commits, I removed nearly all that code before launching BS1.0, but I missed some (the items listed above). Within days, I removed it and replaced it with my own code, copy, and examples. <i></i>Edit:<i></i> for full transparency, you can see Bootstrap 1.0 and the offending content at <a href=""http://d.pr/i/Rn9r"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.pr/i/Rn9r</a>.<p>I made an honest mistake that any developer can by using code from the work I did at my previous employer, but I also fully rectified it immediately by removing all the offending code and replacing it with my own.<p>I made a mistake early on by using the work I had done at ZURB as a basis for everything I have done since then. In the theoretical sense, that is never frowned upon, but in the practical, it is, and I'm sorry about that. But I never ripped Foundation, nor ever intend to. If anything, you need to take a fresh look at Foundation 3 and ask yourself who's really taking code from the other's framework. (edit for clarification).<p>Ever since Bootstrap 2.0 came out, you've ripped nearly every single component we created in our framework and added it to Foundation, including: the basics of our grid system, navbar, responsive navbar, breadcrums, alerts, labels, tooltips, popovers, prepended and appended inputs, breadcrumbs, accordion, progress bars, image styles, and more. All of those were in Bootstrap <i>first</i>, and you've added them without even batting an eye. We've also added things that other frameworks and products added, but when you're calling me out for ripping something I never had access to, you really need to take a step back and look at what you've done as well.<p>I have no illusions about how I got to where I am: I thank everyone profusely, day in and day out, for making it possible. I made the mistake of using the work I did at ZURB to start a brand new project, and I apologize for doing it that way and corrected the mistake within days. I never stole from Foundation, nor do I ever plan to.",1348941595

4590300,comment,4589465,4590127,6,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>One of the things that really bugs me about python is how they keep breaking older stuff.</i><p>That's a fair point, and it applies to a lot more than just programming languages. Operating systems and browsers also come to mind, for example.<p>On the other hand, if you insist on maintaining strict backward compatibility indefinitely, you have increasing drag on every useful new feature you want to introduce. You also can't remove edge cases that should ideally never have been there, even if they make it easy to introduce a bug.<p>In programming languages, this is the C++ effect. Building on the familiar foundation of C was a good decision by Stroustrup in the early days, and I'm sure it contributed greatly to C++'s success. On the other hand, today I believe that C++ is holding back large parts of the programming community, by being good enough in its niche that huge numbers of projects stick with it, yet lacking the expressive power, broad standard library functionality, and clean syntax/semantics that we take for granted in numerous modern programming languages.<p>In general, the goals of stability and progress are always going to be in conflict for any platform-like software. Such software essentially defines a standard for others to program against, and the entire point of standards is to create stability and common ground, but sometimes old standards don't adapt well to incorporate new ideas.<p>I suspect the best we can ever do is restrict major changes, which in practice means those where the old code cannot be automatically converted to get the same behaviour on the new system, to major releases. Minor changes that can be automatically converted are much less of a problem, as long as the ""breaking"" version of the platform comes with a simple conversion tool.<p>To be fair to the Python developers, this is essentially what they've done with the jump from Python 2 to Python 3. There is a tool to deal with converting the trivia, and most of the breaking changes were in the initial jump and acknowledged as such.<p>There probably is a case for making fewer, if any, breaking changes in minor releases. On the other hand, if you're looking at an estimated period of five years to migrate the bulk of the community from one major version to the next, there is probably a fair case for allowing a few smaller but incompatible changes in minor versions as well, as long as their effects are clear and only within a tightly controlled scope so they don't unduly disrupt everyone they aren't there to help.",1348941380

For ease of access I'll re-replicate it here;<p><i>""This is just a PCR study. No evidence that the foreign human DNA even entered host cells, much less that it was expressed. Probably shows only that minute quantities of foreign human DNA can hang around a host body for a while. Most likely explanation is that it gets bound up in the extracellular matrix. Being that the DNA is of human origin, it would not trigger an immune response, but rather, it would just be slowly degraded like the host's own DNA when it is released from dead cells (part of the normal, perpetual turnover of cells). DNA is hardy stuff; people have sequenced DNA from Neanderthal bones.
Study co-author J. Lee Nelson's comments are ridiculous hype. He should be ashamed of himself. That those comments were published in this newspaper uncritically is also an embarrassment.
This work was published in PLoS ONE. PLoS ONE articles are peer reviewed only for the validity of the methods used, not for the importance of the subject matter or the validity of the conclusions drawn.

4590292,comment,4589971,4589971,16,0,haberman,,,"I spent a few weeks in Europe last month and was really struck by how much room for improvement there is in travel guides.  The #1 thing you want to know about travel information is <i>where</i> everything is.  If you read a blurb about some attraction and decide it sounds cool, are we talking a five-minute detour from your existing plans or a day-trip?  Something that only mildly interests you might be worth a quick stop if it's on the way to something else.  Planning a travel itinerary is all about clustering attractions so that you see lots of cool stuff without wasting too much time in transit.<p>Given this, it amazes me how primitive the location features of travel guides are.  When I buy a Lonely Planet guide, even as an eBook, at best I get a small, low-res map with numbers that cross-reference a list of labels that cross-reference the actual blurbs about these places!  This is very slow and labor-intensive to scan.  What I really want is a way to overlay the travel guide on top of my phone's Google Maps, so I can easily see my current location, any markers I've added like my hotel, and travel guides all in a single map.  I want to be able to click a location marker to get the travel guide's blurb.  Bonus points if I can easily combine different travel guides onto a single map (Lonely Planet, Wikitravel, etc.)<p>One awesome thing this would allow is for people to create and curate special-interest travel guides.  For example, the Puget Sound Business Journal maintains a list of attractions called ""The Geek's Guide to Seattle"" (<a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2009/08/The_Geeks_Guide_to_Seattle_53810857.html?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2009/08/Th...</a>).  I would love to be able to search for these kinds of guides when I visit a new city and combine all of them into a single map.  Sort of like Amazon Listmania lists, it would give you an opportunity to find like-minded people and what they think is cool.<p>This is a lot like what KML allows in Google Earth (and maybe Google Maps too?) but very few people use this format and the workflows for using KML in this way don't seem to be very streamlined (for example, it appears you can ""import"" a KML file into maps, but you can't subscribe to one by URL).<p>Established content providers for travel guides might not like this approach because it commoditizes them, but I think it would help the best content to ultimately win out.",1348941253

Having one account where you can pull that data makes these kinds of bookkeeping/accounting tasks incredibly easy.<p>For credit card transactions, try to get a new card just for the startup - or even use an existing card but make sure to dedicate that card exlusively to the startup so months and god forbid, years later, you're not having to go line-by-line through stacks of statements picking & deciphering what was business and what was personal (not fun).",1348939220

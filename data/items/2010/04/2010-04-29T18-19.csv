Or do you think these might be fundamentals that we were going to have to deal with regardless?<p>For bonus points:  How much of those future deficits would you guess have to do with the increasing cost of healthcare?<p>And I'll leave out entirely what they might look like if we hadn't just endured 8 years of studied fingers-in-the-ears idiocy from the Bush administration.

As the number of these apps increases, the pressure grows on Apple to work around the problem rather than simply force Adobe to behavior properly.

Startups today have little or no realistic hope of gaining liquidity through an IPO, leaving them in a position where M&A is their only realistic exit, with the result being that valuations are lowered for founder exits (the consequence of Sarbanes-Oxley, among other new laws).<p>2. Startups today can't simply price their stock based on the reasonable business judgment of a board of directors, nor can they use a simple 10 to 1 ratio in pricing their preferred versus their common stock, but must instead incur significant expense in having to do independent outside appraisals just to take simple steps such as issuing stock options (the new 409A statute and accompanying regulations have brought this about).<p>3. The VC market has been all but dead for the past two years, owing in no small part to congressional actions that helped fuel the Fannie/Freddie subprime mess, leading to a financial meltdown.<p>4. Add to this the hammer that is about to fall on angel funding as reflected in the Dodd bill, and startups will not only have their VC funding sources largely dried up but will have far more restricted access to early-stage funding across the board. In practical terms, this will mean that funding activities will need to be based on: (a) having access to comparatively wealthy angel investors (maybe 25% of the current pool) while being prepared to incur significant delays in getting funds pending a minimum 4-month wait; or (b) relying on Section 4(2), which is the section of the 1933 Securities Act that offers an exemption from registration for private placements but without benefit of the safe-harbor approach of Regulation D and its rules relating to accredited investors (the equivalent of ""walking on the high wire without a net"").<p>Maybe any given point above is over-simplified or overstated but the broad pattern is clear. No individual item is ruinous but each contributes to costs and restricts options. It is not a good trend for startups.",1272566436

People who write bad code won't stop writing bad code just because there's GC available.<p>All that adding a GC would do is move the burden of releasing memory to the GC thread; what would result is that in low-memory conditions (or when the GC runs naturally), you'd have a sudden performance hit as the GC churns through the objects in memory looking for free-able objects. On the desktop, this might not be as much of a performance hit, but on a mobile platform I can see this being an issue.<p>Likewise, the GC can only do so much. If a developer creates an array and starts stuffing objects into it, but never releases/unreferences the array, those objects will likewise never be deallocated. The onus is still on the developer to write proper code, but now they've voluntarily given up control of memory to a separate process that may not understand the code as well as they do.<p>Besides all of that, I haven't found iPhone apps to be unreliable at all.

Given such a format, I don't have to guess what the endpoints are for associated resources; I just look at the href and grab the resource if I want it.<p>A collection could include dataset navigation information, such as:<p><pre><code>  <posts>
    <link rel=""prev"" href=""/posts/?start_id=51&items=50""/>
    <link rel=""next"" href=""/posts/?start_id=101&items=50""/>
    <post href=""/posts/1"">
      <id>1</id>

Now I can implement a less breakable client that doesn't need to munge URL endpoints with database foreign keys. Furthermore, I can navigate through datasets by following the <link rel/> tags.",1272564175

1305365,comment,1305061,1305061,0,0,naner,,,"The look and feel is much improved. The default theme is great -- some of the reds/oranges could be tweaked, tasteful use of transparency (Win 7's is pretty gaudy, IMO), useful desktop effects (alt-tab, desktop switching, minimize/restore). My favorite improvement is all the stuff they did to get rid of the system tray and consolidate the ""notification area"". It looks better and is much more useful. Occasionally the battery icon disappears which is annoying but hopefully that's fixed in the final release.<p>Everything (almost) worked out of the box on my Thinkpad SL410. The mute and mic button on the keyboard don't work by default. Hibernate on lid-close, power saving, and all that jazz work perfectly. It cold boots incredibly fast. Noticeably faster than Windows 7.<p>I haven't figured out how to disable the track pad yet (it isn't in the mouse settings). :/<p>I've been using the RC for almost a week and had it crash once because of (I believe) Pulse Audio. <i>shakes fist in air menacingly</i><p>Before I was using Arch and it never crashed (in a year) but I was using fewer programs and it was very utilitarian.",1272564080
1305363,comment,1304310,1305023,0,0,danudey,,,"Actually, the native-exported apps are mentioned by Jobs in point 6. Of note: these apps were slower than native apps, consumed far more power than native apps, used more memory than native apps, and had little to no integration with the underlying platform, other than running in the first place.<p>Jobs' point talks about this; the issue is that if Flash CS5 supported what the iPhone can do today, who's to say when it will support what iPhone OS 4 can do tomorrow? Will they update Flash on Apple's schedule, or their own? Or at all?<p>For one example, look at GameCenter, Apple's new XBox Live-type service. Would Flash support it? Would Adobe go to the trouble of adding full support for GameCenter to their Flash runtime, so that games written in Flash could make use of that feature?<p>That wouldn't make any sense, because then people would have to write a different Flash app for the iPhone than for Android; either developers use GameCenter on iPhone and nothing on Android, or GameCenter on iPhone and their own solution on Android.<p>My suspicion is that Adobe wouldn't implement it (because it's a lot of work to just support one platform) or wouldn't implement it well (because they just don't really care), and that if it were available developers wouldn't use it (because it would only work on one platform anyway). This leads to a worsening of the overall experience, as the flood of quickly and cheaply ported Flash apps into the App Store dilutes the value that's there.<p>Perhaps Adobe would add GameCenter support, but that might be a new feature for CS6, which might come out (for example) August 2011, after Apple's released iPhone OS 5, with more new features Adobe hasn't had time to implement.<p>Developers using Flash would have a substandard environment, and would produce substandard apps, assuming they even cared at all about doing things right. That's what Apple's trying to prevent.<p>[Edit: typo, point 6, not point 5]",1272564055

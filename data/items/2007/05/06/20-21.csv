I figured they're about the biggest of the shared hosting providers.<p>Maybe the new cPanel will make it even easier, though...",1178484565
20000,comment,19948,19948,0,0,omouse,,,"I don't like the case-sensitive symbols. Nor do I like the implicit quote on symbols...it doesn't make much sense to me but that might because there aren't many good code samples on the site.<p>Is it too much to ask for a nice looking website with lots of good code samples? And a reference link for all the functions that work in the language would be nice.<p>As much as some people dislike newLISP, it at least has a good clear/concise website: <a href=""http://newlisp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newlisp.org/</a> The purpose is clearly stated, and right away you know on what it can run and where to look for comparisons to other Lisps.<p>Not much of a competitor to Arc in my opinion. But pg, please show us some more Arc code :P",1178483918

Which is precisely what Douglas Crockford advocates (<a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/little.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascript.crockford.com/little.html</a> - he's got an example of the Y Combinator too). <p>Javascript's <i>arguments.callee</i> will also let you define anonymous recursive functions (though I realize that was not really the point of the post).

19995,comment,19986,19993,0,0,vlad,,,"Shared web hosting providers?  I don't think so.  I'd say in the low hundreds of all shared web hosts do, but not thousands.  And of those, very few will offer any support.  On the other hand, PHP comes with every single shared hosting installation that exists.  I don't know of one that doesn't offer PHP support because it comes standard with... CPanel.<p>From PHP.net -- <i>""Today, PHP is being used by hundreds of thousands of developers (estimated), and several million sites report as having it installed.""</i>",1178481712

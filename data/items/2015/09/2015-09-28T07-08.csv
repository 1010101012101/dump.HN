Cantonese is probably the non-Mandarin dialect with the most writing going on, and that is mostly informal writing like facebook, blogs, gossip magazines, although there is some modern literature written in Cantonese characters, wikipedia in Cantonese probably counts as well for more formal writing.<p>>> The Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set, for instance, is a set of characters that are specific to the Cantonese dialect, and don&#x27;t have close/exact relatives in standard written Mandarin<p>Yes, though I don&#x27;t know if there are Unicode code points for all the Cantonese characters. You often see this like o的,o個,o即 instead of 啲,嗰,嘅. I know a lot of people in Hong Kong use Cangjie for character input and a lot of the Cantonese characters don&#x27;t have (or didn&#x27;t have) Cangjie mappings.<p>>> I wonder how this affects written communication for those who don&#x27;t speak Mandarin natively<p>When speaking Taiwanese it is common to use Mandarin words for more educated topics or if you don&#x27;t know the word in Taiwanese just use the Mandarin term. Probably because Taiwanese is not generally used in higher education and there are varying levels of Taiwanese fluency in Taiwan. I would imagine it&#x27;s similar for a lot of dialects in China since speaking dialects is often discouraged and a lot of younger people abandon their native dialects.",1443425553

10289266,comment,10288231,10289236,0,0,bdchauvette,,,"The short, unsatisfying answer is that using `class` is deprecated in React, and has been for a while.<p>For a longer answer, take a look at the discussion of issue #4433 on github [1], especially the following comment by spicyj [2]:<p>> [...] We&#x27;re sticking with className and htmlFor for a couple of reasons:<p>> First, we tend to look at HTML properties (like el.className = ...) when possible, as opposed to attributes (like el.setAttribute(&#x27;class&#x27;, ...)). Attributes are always string-typed, while properties can have any JavaScript object value, which gives more flexibility in some circumstances. One example is the .classList property, which arguably is a better fit for the data model than .className is. React doesn&#x27;t support classList right now, but it certainly could. Given that React&#x27;s className behaves like the HTML property of the same name, it makes sense to keep that name.<p>> Another reason is more forward-thinking. In the future, idiomatic React may use object destructuring to pick apart this.props. The react-future repo shows one example of how this could work. Even in modern browsers, this wouldn&#x27;t work with class and for which are keywords and can&#x27;t appear as standalone identifiers even though they can appear as property names.<p>> Third, our thinking is that JSX&#x27;s primary advantage is the symmetry of matching closing tags which make code easier to read, not the direct resemblance to HTML or XML. It&#x27;s convenient to copy/paste HTML directly, but other minor differences (in self-closing tags, for example) make this a losing battle and we have a HTML to JSX converter to help you anyway. Finally, to translate HTML to idiomatic React code, a fair amount of work is usually involved in breaking up the markup into components that make sense, so changing class to className is only a small part of that anyway.<p>----<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4433"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4433</a>

that is focused on providing insurance when it should have been providing better healthcare. There is no easy answer here, but companies are going to want to make profits and the system incentivizes them to spend money developing a few critical drugs, holding on to the patent and pricing it as high as possible, the dev costs are passed to the insurance companies which are passed on to you in premiums as well as inflation, as insurance companies operate much like a bank.

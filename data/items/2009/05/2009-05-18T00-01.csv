IMHO this makes it a better business than Loopt. Not easier in the sense of requires less work, but easier again in the sense that if it doesn't go viral the first day they can keep iterating until it does. And maybe it never will, but the chances of success are still much better because there are more options along the critical path.<p>edit: At any point if Scribd hadn't been able to add a zero to their traffic stats they could have leveraged their asset to do something slightly different. Loopt never had this luxury. If at any point they couldn't add a zero then the whole project was worth nothing. My point was that someone more experienced would have known this and chosen to start a business more like Scribd and less like Loopt. (If they only cared about the money.)",1242607936

As its costs increase, the price where it maximizes its profits is affected.<p>> In other words, raising minimum wage doesn't mean Bob won't get a job<p>That's simply wrong.  Things that can't be produced profitably aren't produced voluntarily.  There are lots of goods that aren't produced because they can't be produced profitably.  The folks who would have been employed producing them are either unemployed or doing something else, displacing someone else from that job.<p>Of course, good people are welcome to pay folks more than the value of their labor, price things below cost, or set their prices for reasons other than profit maximization.  If their economic theories are correct, everything will work out well for them and they'll have significant economic advantages over folks who do otherwise.  Those advantages will cause economic harm to said other folks.<p>Yet, good people don't actually act on their convictions.  Instead, they try to coerce others to act on those convictions.

Then possibly variations, improvizations, and so on. Then there may be deliberate ""detuned"" elements, like in Gilmour's solo improvizations or Nina Simone's vocals. This looks like a huge tree for your search.<p>To add complexity, in some modern genres like electronica musicians also express themselves using timbre dynamics combined with notes.<p>But apart from that, there's a problem with identifying automatically which of your variants you generated are good, which comes down to what is good music.<p>Then performance.

I've learned to ignore his jackassery and respect him for when he talks about the things he's really bright about.<p>Operating system debates are like sports team arguments: yes, one sports team is better than all the others, but nobody will ever agree on just which that is, the arguments get far too fierce, and it's the greatest waste of time imaginable.",1243490389

I think it'd also be a useful introspection tool to understand your way of working.<p>I'd tried to record my own development sessions using screen capture, but that just ground my machine to a halt.  Does anyone know of any software for recording an Emacs session and playing it back in ""real-time"" (e.g. I'd like to see where I paused to think vs. a compressed time version).<p>If you're interested in working on a project like this, drop me a line!",1243490246

629841,comment,629726,629726,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Re #1 - drop monthly and increase per-use fees (to $10-20) and your idea will find its audience.<p>Monthly fees drag the customers in a long-term relationship that they most likely don't want to be entering. Setting the per-use fee that low serves no purpose. If you want to go after customers with no money, you <i>will</i> get them. Instead however you could go for those who can pay, and you would still be able to acquire them, since the idea works for them as well.",1243490121
629840,comment,629040,629040,0,0,dlevine,,,"I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I worked for a couple of top software companies, and had a job that most people would have loved. But, somehow I was unsatisfied. It got harder and harder to do productive work. After some soul searching, my conclusion was that I just didn't want to be an engineer.<p>I decided to go to business school. Two years later, I'm graduating and starting a software company. But I have a new set of tools and contacts that I didn't have before, as well as a different perspective on business. I'm looking forward to doing things other than just coding (although I'm going to have to write some code, since there are only three of us).<p>Have you considered grad school? A lot of ex-engineers do well in finance or law. Business school in particular gives you two years to explore potential job options and figure out what you want to do with your life.",1243490044

629838,comment,629572,629572,0,0,azanar,,,"Relatively rarely. I usually try to develop an intuitive sense of where my argument wants to go before I start typing, and I'm sure many a potential comment has been culled this way. When I'm typing along and find that I hit a contradiction, or something indicating something in my intuition has gone afoul, my first thought is usually: huh, I wonder how many other people think this. I've found that seeing someone's train of thought is at least as interesting as seeing where it concluded.<p>On the other hand, there have been many times where I'd thought about commenting, but could not get an intuitive grasp of what I wanted to say, and would keep deleting the first sentence as soon as I wrote it. On those occasions, I would just press 'Back' and keep reading.",1243489795

Even with the different hardware, it still works ""well enough"" everywhere.<p>There's very little difference in the hardware there.  The 3G has slightly better hardware + GPS, and the Touch has no phone.  But most of the components are the same.  That's not quite the same as running on completely different models from different manufacturers.  I don't share the concerns about Android voiced in your comment's parent, but I don't think the iPhone OS is a good counterexample.<p>>Nice Apple fanboi-ing though, I really enjoyed it.<p>Unless the parent edited his comment drastically, this is completely unfounded, and it's also the kind of lowbrow ad homimen crap I'd like to think the HN community is above.",1243489371

For many businesses, a static page is more than sufficient - it's a non-confrontational way for them to communicate with a potential client, give that client a feel for the business before the client has to make a phone call. My experience doesn't accord with issues like <i>""the ISP paid in advance, and the site continues as a zombie""</i>.<p>I'd like to see more businesses with blogs, and they would benefit. But in terms of priorities, I work with several businesses right now where a blog would be detrimental because it would overtake things like 'sales' on their to-do list. More advanced websites exist for other business reasons, but this advice isn't designed for businesses wanting to sell product through their site anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.shirlawsonline.com/blogs/171-there-are-only-four-good-reasons-to-have-a-business-website"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirlawsonline.com/blogs/171-there-are-only-four-...</a>",1243487839

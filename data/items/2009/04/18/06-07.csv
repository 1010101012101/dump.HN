568146,comment,568079,568079,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I actually quite like pay in advance. If you're not really using a service like you thought you can extend the use over a long period making it worthwhile. Of course the same applies to pay for what you use, after the fact, but then there is some ongoing mental load with remembering to either keep or cancel your account.",1240037666

568142,comment,567278,568076,0,0,kragen,,,"Yeah, if you use an unduly narrow definition of ""start-up"", you can get some small number in the few thousands.  But if you use a more normal definition (like the one at the top of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company</a> — “A startup company or start-up is a company with a limited operating history. These companies, generally newly created, are in a phase of development and research for markets,” or my usual rule of thumb, “A startup is a company that has not yet become profitable,”) you get a much larger number, perhaps in the millions.",1240037023

568139,comment,567807,567807,0,0,davidw,,,"One thing that helped me a lot: investing some money in some salsa dancing lessons.  First of all, I actually enjoy it, it's fun (if you don't like it you wont' get far).  Second, it's sort of cool, compared to, say, talking about startups and computers with someone who is potentially not interested in either one.  Also, it's something where practice does pay off, and where you can't fake it, so investing some time will get you results.  It's a real dance, too, between a man and a woman (well, a couple in any case, but we'll leave out the PC stuff for the sake of convenience) where the man leads and the woman follows, and they hold on to one another, not one of those flaily club type dance things.  You can learn a lot about someone in a 2 or 3 minute dance with them, actually, and if you go to the right sort of clubs, people often change partners, so you have the chance to dance with lots of different people (so it's sort of like speed dating, but not so silly) and see what works out.  Most places I've ever been to, people are having fun and smile, which I find a lot more attractive than the pouty, I'm-too-cool look.  Oh, and finally, women who know how to really dance salsa are hot.  Moving and swaying like that really adds something!  Getting up the confidence to ask people to dance is really good too.  You'll get shot down lots too, but you learn to deal with that.",1240036758

Generally I think it's legal to take a copy of a copyrighted work that you obtained legally and take it to another country, say, in your luggage.  How is this any different?<p>Edit: Under the law that makes ""import or export"" a right exclusive to the copyright holder, apparently.  Thanks for the correction!",1240035708

568120,comment,567827,568103,0,0,scott_s,,,"When reasoning about the system, one still has to reason about the introduced bugs, because it's always possible there's a bug in the introduction of bugs. In fact, given the difficulty of proving the correctness of non-trivial programs, I think it's likely the introduced bugs would bleed out into the rest of the system.<p>I sincerely doubt any developers would ""get this problem."" The behavior you're describing is severe OCD. You don't catch it like a cold. If one's OCD is that severe, it will probably manifest in many more areas of their lives than just programming.<p>There's also the fact that most developers work in teams, and the people who don't have this form of OCD would not tolerate having purposefully introduced bugs. I know I wouldn't.",1240034757

568117,comment,567807,567807,0,0,Tsagadai,,,"The guy has a number of things backward or set in stone.<p>First off you can have your cake and eat it. You don't actually need to cease being anything to get laid you just have to look harder. Honesetly, it is just that easy, somewhere out there is a woman/man/transgender looking for someone just like you. Hell, there are probably 10 people like that in every country.<p>Second, the author takes a very macho outlook on dating. You don't have to do that. People are quite varied. Some like X, some prefer Y and some really love Q. His entire 'be the (wo)man' bit just smacks of heterocentricism and ignorance. Some people like the same. If that is you I encourage you to pursue that because you will be far, far happier than if you repress who you really are.<p>Third. This point is just my advice. Don't deride people or look down on them. You will find love in peculiar places if only you look. So you're smart. Big deal. Don't dismiss that girl who left school before senior or the guy who never went to college. There are different forms of intelligence and you can find intelligent people who are not in the mold of the traditionally smart, educated and successful.<p>And lastly, get out of the house/town/country. You will never find anyone, not even for a date if you don't get away from your personal comfort zone. I'm not dismissing those who only want to meet people through friends only that you must be truly lucky to find love that way. It is always best to expand yourself and head to the horizon of the known.",1240034589

10762079,comment,10751827,10751827,0,0,onga5v,,,"I see several people in this thread welcoming the fact that there is &quot;finally an alternative to SSRIs&quot;. I don&#x27;t want to discuss whether Ketamine is or is not a good alternative to SSRIs -- instead, I&#x27;d like to point out that there are already a great number of alternatives to SSRIs.<p>For one, there are tricyclics (TCAs), which were the first antidepressants on the market, and generally are not prescribed nowadays. Another category of older antidepressants includes MAOIs, which were the first mass-market antidepressants. These are also not generally prescribed nowadays due to interactions with common types of food, although modern MAOIs such as moclobemide [1] require far less diatary restrictions than the older MAOIs did. The final major category I&#x27;ll mention are SNRIs, which along with SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed first-line antidepressants.<p>Apart from these major categories, there are a bunch of atypical antidepressants on the market. There&#x27;s bupropion, which I personally take, and which has far less side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs but may not be as effective for all patients. There&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s wort, which is available off prescription in many countries. There&#x27;s lithium, which has recently gained popularity. In total, I would guess there are about a hundred different types of antidepressants in production around the world (including old Soviet concoctions that are not available in the West due to the huge price of getting just one of them to market).<p>If you&#x27;re unhappy with the side effects of SSRIs, I would encourage you to look up other types of antidepressants, as they have very widely varying side effects, and most atypicals have far <i>fewer</i> common side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs do. In particular, I would like to point out that bupropion usually <i>increases</i> sex drive instead of lowering it like SNRIs and SSRIs tend to do.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moclobemide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moclobemide</a>",1450486623

One has to wonder, if one could draw a physical parallel between a trespassing and gray-hat style hack, if you did enter someones house, take their gold watch from their bedroom, then walk down to you sitting at your breakfast table and tap you on the shoulder, and then say, &quot;Hey bro, your door was open, and you didn&#x27;t even secure your jewelry in a safe with a key in case someone did break in. I did this to demonstrate your house&#x27;s vulnerabilities, you should be grateful! May be even give me a little something for my troubles...&quot;<p>Of course, the parallel might not be fair, since one can&#x27;t draw a parallel between a private house and a server with a public facing access point to sensitive material, so the closest proxy I can think of is a bank. Still, a similar parable can be drawn here: You rob a bank without tripping alarms and hand the manager $30000 of stolen money, and claim you did it to warn him/er of issues with the vault&#x27;s security. In that case, it&#x27;s plausible to assume s/he might not be that receptive.<p>I think it&#x27;s great that penetration testers and people of the like are very willing to do the hard work of finding holes in security systems--and not use it for nefarious purposes, but actually disclose it to companies so that they can holster their systems--but how exactly is the hacked party supposed to take it?<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/18/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-dnc-suspension/index.html?sr=fbCNN121815olitics/bernie-sanders-campaign-dnc-suspension/index.html1129PMVODtopLink&linkId=19717317"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/18/politics/bernie-sanders-campai...</a>",1450486445

Is it because I have the right to immediately measure it and complain?<p>In a different life, I worked at Starbucks. About once a quarter (per my recollection) we got secret shoppers who, among other things, would actually weigh the drinks they ordered to ensure employees were making them correctly. Bad reports were a pretty big deal, so management tended to take care to respond to any problems quickly.<p>And yes, you could absolutely complain if you ordered a 12 oz latte and received one that was only 3/4 filled. You&#x27;d get it remade immediately and probably a coupon for a free drink on your next visit (at least, that was policy at the store I worked at, when I worked there).<p>Things like scales (for weighing purchased coffee beans, as well as internal use) were actually certified by the county department of weights and measures every year.",1450486358

Nothing is guaranteed; that 150k can vanish in a puff of smoke through no fault of your own, and take all your unvested comp along with it.<p>> the bonus is basically guaranteed.<p>No, it is not.  Many, many people will tell you of their time spent at BigCo when the economy is <i>not</i> booming, and after the free donuts, the first thing that goes is the bonus.  You have to read the bonus plan very carefully to understand how it&#x27;s computed.  It&#x27;s quite possible that your bonus at Facebook or whatever depends solely on your own rating, but at most companies that&#x27;s just the final multiplier and all kinds of other things have to happen in order for the bonus pool to exist at all.  In even mild headwinds, it&#x27;s likely that only a part of the expected bonus will be paid, and not unusual for there to be none at all.  Furthermore, the bonus plan is usually determined one year at a time, so the fact that whatever needed to happen this year for everyone to be paid at 100% did happen is no guarantee that the criteria in next year&#x27;s plan will be satisfied.<p>Do not assume that the future looks exactly like the recent past.  It is certainly possible that the near future will be even <i>better</i> than the recent past, but at least some kind of mean reversion is a hell of a lot more likely.  I predict that very few people will end up receiving as much total cash for their work over the next 5 years as their simplistic and rosy-eyed calculations of today would indicate.",1450486243

He failed to see the point that so many of his ideas were US-centric, and didn&#x27;t make sense in any context outside of English-speaking languages, and to be honest, they barely made sense in English. The author brings up Gmail, which has an icon for &quot;archive&quot; that makes zero sense no matter how I try to connect the dot, but at least Gmail gives you and out: turn the confusing icons to text.<p>Despite being a programmer -- but not front end work -- I find myself struggling more and more with UI and especially icons. I think so much of it reflects the current trend of zero empathy for the end-user. Fortunately, I know enough about computers to get around many of these issues, but icons are the one area that I still struggle with.<p>Unless you have some site with several million users, teaching end-users is a wasted effort, and it does well to either piggy-back on other ideas or use text. Even Facebook is using text, and it seems a little odd that anyone smaller would feel they have some lessons to teach the end-user about UI. UI, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;pretty,&quot; it means &quot;usable,&quot; which is sort of implied by U meaning &quot;user.&quot; If a significant portion of your user-base is computer illiterate, which will often be the default, it does well to UI to the lowest common denominator. Once your user presses the back button because your icons made them feel stupid, you lost a customer, and that is a very high price for &quot;pretty.&quot;",1450486082

The rest goes to the cost of non-cash compensation, various governments, and your tax-deferred retirement savings.  It&#x27;s usually slightly more than half, depending on the exact numbers, whether you&#x27;re buying medical plans for a family, how much you save in a retirement plan, etc., but that&#x27;s the safe first-order approximation if you&#x27;re budgeting.<p>So someone starting at BigCo in California should expect to take home 100-125k a year for the first few years.  That said, I would caution new entrants to the workforce about three things:<p>- Tax rates are likely to go up, and certainly will not be going down.  It would not be shocking if you were taking home 10% less in a few years solely because of higher taxes.  You can also expect your cost of living to grow much more quickly than the tax bracket boundaries will rise.<p>- Your RSUs are likely to be worth less than you&#x27;re expecting, because market prices will decline in a bust (a major bust is all but certain at some point in your upcoming 4-year vesting period).<p>- In a bust, you will likely get a smaller bonus or none at all (even if the company is still making money), and are unlikely to get a raise, even a nominal cost of living adjustment.  These conditions can last for several years, so even if you keep your job (hardly a given), your total compensation will likely be much less than you expected when you were hired.  A few companies may be doing well enough that you will be exempt, but don&#x27;t count on it.<p>All of these things need to be factored in when evaluating compensation.  It&#x27;s not as simple as adding X + Y + Z and assuming that all changes over the next 5 years will be either neutral or positive.  That&#x27;s not how life is.",1450485783

The rest of the world moved to the next three major technological revolutions: personal computers, the internet and smart phones.<p>Japan&#x27;s entry into the PC market was timed in sync with the 80s boom economy, which meant every conglomerate on the islands turned it into a fractured, incompatible mess. Even imported standards, like the IBM PC standard, were turned into incompatible islands of technology like the FM-Towns. MSX was the big hope for a standard, but for various reasons failed to get to market in the U.S. (the biggest market) and died like everybody else did when IBM PCs came to market (notable exception Apple).<p>This meant there was no real PC market in place for the internet to attach to. While everybody else everywhere in the world was getting PCs specifically to send email and surf the early web. Japan funneled the internet into impossibly limited flip phones, turning it into not much more than an AOL-like information portal that the carriers could have just provided themselves -- but also meant it took longer to become the kind of full-on cultural phenomenon it became elsewhere.<p>Smart phones are, in many ways, a miniaturization and untethering of both previous technological waves and Japan, stuck using very limited internet on flip phones and the occasional PC didn&#x27;t catch on to this trend.<p>Thus the first wave of PCs caused a boom in the U.S., the second wave of the Internet caused a wave everywhere <i>but</i> Japan, and the third wave caused a boom in the U.S. (Apple again) and now caught up South Korea (which coincidentally imported the Internet and PCs as a single phenomenon during their later economic boom so they had the environment where smartphones made sense) and to some extent Taiwan.<p>Japan missed all of this stuff and the catchup efforts never made it off the islands. Even in Japan, the top smartphones are iPhones and Japanese Internet sites look like late 90s design.<p>Developing export channels for physical goods is almost hilariously expensive. If you haven&#x27;t just been doing it, getting a new channel going is very hard -- and having few channels for export of PCs and smartphones and an already well developed and competitive global market meant that the incentive to export Japanese made PCs and Smartphones no longer existed (this combined with a general downswing in the Japanese economy making access to capital investment for export pushes more difficult). Japan also spent the 80s dictating how the rest of the world was supposed to do business with them, while other export driven economies were more pragmatic in their dealings with everybody else and so the kinds of relationship building everybody else does was foreign to aging Japanese businessmen.<p>This all combines for the both the very inward looking domestic market only focus Japan&#x27;s tech industry has taken over the last 10-20 years and the lack of general technological and cultural development clearly visible in Japan. It&#x27;s not that the Japanese are stupid or not creative, just that fortune didn&#x27;t favor them and their stuck waiting for better conditions to coincide with the next technological wave.",1450485472

The bottom has the following:<p>> The Uniform Vehicle Code states:<p>>    Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic ...<p>> This law refers to the &quot;normal&quot; speed of traffic, not the &quot;legal&quot; speed of traffic. The 60 MPH driver in a 55 MPH zone where everybody else is going 65 MPH must move right. Contrast Alaska&#x27;s rule, 13 AAC 002.50, allowing vehicles driving at the speed limit to use the left lane, and Colorado rev. stat. 42-4-1103, prohibiting blocking the &quot;normal and reasonable&quot; movement of traffic.<p>> Enforcement is inconsistent. Toledo police used to ticket truck drivers for driving at the 60 MPH speed limit in the left lane. Police looking for criminal activity frequently use the &quot;keep right&quot; law as a pretext to stop a suspicious car. On the other hand, a New York judge announced that he would not convict drivers for blocking speeding traffic, People v. Ilieveski, 175 Misc. 2d 943; 670 N.Y.S.2d 1004 (Monroe County N.Y. 1998).",1450484874

The bay area and perhaps Manhattan were the highest, I forget what was in the second, and the third was basically &quot;everywhere else&quot;.  The difference between the top and bottom was maybe 10-15%, considerably less than the width of the salary band for each grade.<p>So to make it concrete, a new hire at a particular grade might have gotten $120k in SF or $105k in Little Rock (base).  Considering the high taxes and housing costs in SF, the new hire in Little Rock would have had a much higher standard of living.<p>Of course, working at a non-HQ site is a <i>major</i> career-limiter, so 10 years down the road you might have been better off relocating anyway.

It&#x27;s a very good question, and the answer may simply be that script systems are inferior, but anecdotally I would say there are two advantages:<p>First, it makes the etymology of the script is very apparent. Often etymology in for example English is very obscure, and requires great leaps of imagination and inference to make the connections. Compare that to the character 灣 referred to in the piece, which means &quot;bay&quot; and contains the &quot;water radical.&quot; The etymology can be made more clear in this way.<p>Second, the script is agnostic to how the characters are pronounced. This is what has allowed it to be used for several languages in China (often inaccurately referred to as &quot;dialects&quot;)—which are often pronounced completely differently—for hundreds of years.<p>That said, there are clearly many, many disadvantages, and the main thing preventing change may simply be inertia.",1450484664

10761898,comment,10751827,10761505,0,0,cjhveal,,,"While a moderately high dosage of Ketamine does have anesthetic effects, through it&#x27;s antagonism of the NMDA receptor at dosages (which suppresses activity required for signals to cross spine/brain), inhibition of nitric oxide production, and weak agonism of opioid receptors, it also has a slew of other interactions at various affinities.<p>Ketamine inhibits the reuptake of all three major monoamines. Thus it mimics to some degree both the mechanisms of action of SNRIs (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) such as venlafaxine (effexor), used to treat depression/anxiety and DNRIs (dopamine/norepinephrine) such as bupropion (wellbutrin)/methylphenidate (ritalin), which are used to treat depression/ADHD. Ketamine also impacts the acetylcholine receptors, which have been linked to anti-depressant effects, and the less-well-researched sigma receptor.<p>While the above interactions may contribute to the reported anti-depressant effects, some of those same interactions make it undesirable as a medication. Dopamine reuptake inhibitors and mu-opioid antagonists are notoriously abused for their euphoric effects. However, those effects are contrasted with psychotomimetic effects of ketamine&#x27;s interaction with NMDA, kappa-opioid, muscarinic acetylcholine, and simga receptors.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s incorrect to simply categorize ketamine as a depressant or a sedative. The body is an exceptionally complex chemical network, and you&#x27;re right to be skeptical. But I think it&#x27;s important that we not dismiss the positive reported effects of the drug because of the side effects that occur at various points on the dose-response curve. We may find out that by controlling dosage we can tune a beneficial level of antidepressant response without psychosis, dissociation, or amnesic effects due to hormetic effects. Or it might work exceptionally well for some otherwise treatment-resistant cases. Even if not, we&#x27;ll be able to use that data to tweak the binding affinities to investigate drugs that have a better therapeutic use.",1450483693

Certainly they are not directly interchangeable, but I think Swift brings a lot of the benefits of an FP language like Haskell or OCaml but is eminently more practical and applicable. Or at least it will be as the OS community behind it gains speed.<p>So Haskell is still on my radar but, for now, off my list of things I intend to learn.",1450483330

The type system is... I used to think it was really good, now I&#x27;d just call it &quot;OK&quot;.  JNI is useful for getting certain things done, but the syntax is gouge-your-eyeballs-out awful.  Checked exceptions are very useful if you are serious about error handling, and a royal pain if/when you are not.<p>But the thing that was great about Java, to me, was the library.  It was like Barbie - it had <i>everything</i>.  I&#x27;m just talking about the standard Java library here.<p>Then you get into the other libraries - Spring and J2EE frameworks and Hibernate and so on, and the XML configuration files multiply.  They do great things, but if you have to change what they do, you have to change some setting in some XML file, which uses some syntax that you don&#x27;t know, and your job is to figure out which XML file and which setting and where the documentation is, and you just go insane.  I understand why people loathe that environment.",1450483298

Right now we know that it&#x27;s theoretically possible but it&#x27;s very slow, too slow for uses other than maybe very niche things.<p>In the next five years I fully expect to see an <i>acceptably fast</i> implementation that will broaden use to the application areas you mention: high security stuff and crypto junkies.<p>At that point is where things will get interesting. To make homomorphic crypto really fast will take custom silicon. As soon as I see acceptably fast software homomorphic, I expect to see either a startup or one or more projects inside big companies very quickly pop up with the goal of producing either homomorphic silicon to pair with an existing CPU or -- more interestingly -- a CPU that computes homomorphically as its native mode of operation. <i>That</i> could get interesting.<p>I predict that by 2030 you will be able to spin up a 100% &quot;blind&quot; sealed VM in the cloud for <$20/month that is fast enough to run what can run on an average cloud instance today.<p><i>All</i> compute doesn&#x27;t have to be homomorphic to get the benefits. You only really need it for encryption, decryption, key generation, authentication, and indexing of security critical data. Boilerplate stuff can be done in the clear.

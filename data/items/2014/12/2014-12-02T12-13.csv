8686797,comment,8677788,8683419,0,0,rzwitserloot,,,"In 16th century england, probably.<p>The only country that has a statistically significant # of people working consistently over 40 hours a week, are in the US. These people eventually work themselves to an early grave, and often end up costing society a lot in the form of requiring expensive healthcare because of their unhealthy lifestyle.<p>This slippery slope goes both ways. I&#x27;ll run down both slopes just as a thought exercise:<p>If we give you the freedom of choice to work yourself to death, then efficiency goes way down. proof? Well, let&#x27;s look at the US, where minimum wage is dirt cheap and between immigrants sending money home and the simple fact that people can&#x27;t make ends meet without working more than 40 hours (bad social security), it actually happens a lot. This part of the US job market is markedly less healthy than for example europe. It&#x27;s simply inefficient: These conditions are causing rampant crime (SEE: factor 100, not exaggerating, higher incarceration rates, which is also due to drug policy, but bad social security and crappy entry-level job market isn&#x27;t helping surely), and crime is actually more expensive. It costs society the same amount of money to throw 5 people of a 100 in jail and have the remaining 95 work like dogs, then it is to give all 100 a better education and a better social security safety net, and have 95 work normal hours and have 5 on paid low-level subsistence.<p>In the end, either (A) society gets to decide how much you get to work, or (B) if you are so poor that it costs society more to let you live (due to either having to incarcerate you, or paying for your acute hernia due to overworking yourself or collapsed lung because you hit a tree due to exhaustion), society takes out a gun and shoots you.<p>So, unless we&#x27;re all willing to take the moral stance that society is justified in killing anybody that doesn&#x27;t clearly prove that they are a net positive contribution to society, then &#x27;individual freedom of choice&#x27; is a pipe dream in this aspect, and more liberal, in the sense that you&#x27;re intentionally letting society pay for an individual&#x27;s poor health choice.<p>And going down the other slope: If society gets to dictate how you should live because it ends up having to pay the bills if you live badly, then society gets to ban pork, cigarettes, alcohol, driving of any sort, all housing will be built strictly to exact code and nothing else, the state will take care of your finances, etc, etc. extreme communism.<p>Let&#x27;s just go with: socio-economic models are a heck of a lot more complicated, and extremist positions such as &#x27;always just let everyone do whatever, no laws!&#x27; are usually deplorably wrong or misguided. There are no easy answers.<p>NB: Note that few to no countries make it illegal to work over the established normal working week hours. However, they DO declare that this construes overtime and adds economic disincentives. For example, overtime is taxed more heavily, or the state sets a higher minimum wage for overtime hours, etc.",1417524483

8686792,comment,8685336,8686598,0,0,VLM,,,"I got an alternative interpretation by reading it in minutes and torpedo ranges.<p>All the real specs are classified but the pessimistic public stats indicate a nuclear sub can be out of destruction range within five or so minutes, assuming your detection is perfect to the foot.<p>Also the destruction distance makes it a nearly perfect ASW weapon against WWII submarines equipped with WWII torpedoes, because the range of an old Mk18 is a mile or so, so if a WWII submarine came thru a time warp and got in close enough to attack a modern carrier, the destroyer screen could pretty much one-shot the sub without serious damage to itself.<p>The problem comes from modern torps and modern subs.  So a nuke running at 20 kts fires a Mk 48 at comfortable-ish 10 miles (eh, maybe half its unofficial range).  First of all being 10 miles away you can&#x27;t just drop the depth charge and expect it to destroy a sub 5 times further away than the official limit.  Secondly, at 20 knots for the nuke sub and 20 knots for the ASW destroyer, that 10 miles is 30 minutes to get over the launch position for a destroyer at which time the sub is 10 miles away in a random direction, far out of range.  Third even if a destroyer or ASW plane is overhead and drops the charge on a sub, from the testing they detonated at 2500 feet down, and that half mile is going to take awhile.  Not that long, but awhile.  Meanwhile the sub floors it and at (classified) top speed its going to take well under 2 minutes to get out of the destruction zone.<p>Its not exactly fish the barrel if you try to wargame it out.  The TLDR is drawing a one mile radius circle of destruction isn&#x27;t necessarily effective if your target takes substantially less than 3 minutes to go one mile.",1417524385

8686788,comment,8686346,8686346,0,0,borplk,,,"I generally agree with the ideas presented but I think we miss an even larger point.<p>I should probably write this at a better time as a blog post, but briefly:<p>Why are we trying so hard to &quot;abstract&quot; out the database? If you have done any significant SQL work you&#x27;d agree that no ORM or abstraction can ever hope to beat the expressiveness and power of raw SQL.<p>We have spent decades trying to reduce all these awesome database technologies down to their lowest common denominator so that you can switch databases in and out and as if they are not important.<p>Most software revolves around data, software mostly is data. So if you can treat your database layer as a blob-store you are not making good use of it. Database in my view is such a core piece of technology that I pick one, and the right one, and stick to it and make use of its capabilities to the maximum.<p>And we have spent decades trying to adapt SQL into programming-language-specific concepts. We have to grab SQL and twist and turn it with some similarly named half-assed SQL pasta function chain to imitate SQL.<p>So my point is this, why don&#x27;t we try to make the programming languages adapt to SQL, instead of the other way around?<p>Every non-trivial piece of software needs some form of data persistence with querying and sorting and ordering and all that good stuff that SQL does.<p>After this long, as far as our programming languages are concerned our SQL queries are still plain &#x27;strings&#x27;.<p>I think there should be a tighter integration, and acknowledgement from those making the languages, that hey, every half-serious user is going to be using SQL with this thing.<p>One idea could be something along the lines of &#x27;literal-sql&#x27; syntax. To &#x27;upgrade&#x27; SQL from being a plain string into something that the language acknowledges.<p>Then the compiler could do a whole lot more. The language/compiler could be made aware by some mechanism about the database layer so it could figure how to turn your DATETIME column into the corresponding type in the programming language and vice versa.<p>And you could write something like &quot;DateType myDate = <SQL>SELECT date from posts</SQL>;&quot;.<p>The model-based ORM does not make it easy for you to query custom fields because it tries to package everything into a box.<p>I think the programming languages need to embrace and accept SQL as a first-class citizen.<p>The compiler could potentially be able to connect to the database and generate some type-safe classes for use from the schema.<p>Ada with the GNATColl package is the closest thing to this idea I have seen.<p>It can inspect the schema and generate rock-solid type-safe classes for use with database.<p>It frees you to make full use of the power of your database instead of crippling it.<p>Edit:
Put another way, after all these years the way programming languages treat data persistence is virtually unchanged. The attitude is stuck mostly at &quot;ehh whatever just open your socket/file and write the bytes... I don&#x27;t care if it goes down the drain or to a database&quot;.<p>I think there lies some potential for a next-generation change. The programming language and the database can work a bit more closely together, I don&#x27;t mean in an interactive or real-time way but basically the compiler/tooling could say &quot;hey we know everyone is going to need to save these things into some database at some point and get them back ... so let us help you with that ...&quot;<p>It could in the form of an inspection step that you can trigger and it could say &#x27;ok I see you&#x27;ve got these 20 tables that you are interested in and that column from that table is a boolean with a not null constraint so I&#x27;ll watch out for that when you are writing your queries...&#x27; sort of thing.<p>Obviously statically and strongly typed and generally more &#x27;safe&#x27; languages would have an advantage here because they can know more about your program statically.<p>Sorry it&#x27;s a bit late and that&#x27;s not in the most coherent way I could put it, just quickly typed it up for the sake of visibility and discussion.",1417524237

Thin-film optics relies on interference effects between transmitted and reflected light, and enables very specific optical behavior. For example, using thin films it is possible to make a stack of layers that reflects a very specific, narrow band of wavelenghts, while transmitting everything else. In real-life, rewritable optical media such as CD-RW and DVD-RW make use of thin-film optics.<p>The point though is that thin-film optics only works for coherent light, such as laser light. Sunlight is not coherent, and you will not get the desired interference effects, because the light waves are not &quot;synchronized&quot;, as it were.<p>So while I could be wrong, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the performance of this reflective sheet is very low, and nowhere near what would be required to replace air-con.",1417523876

I did not study economy in university, so apologies if I&#x27;m covering well trodden ground or not using the right terminology, but, reasoning it out:<p>Something like an excellent michelin-star level experience in a a restaurant is some serious luxury and it shows: People pay through the nose for it. And yet, you don&#x27;t really need more capital (if that is the right word) to make this a reality for far more people: You CAN have everyone work far less and yet have far more people eat like this, simply because a very large part of the resources required to make this dining experience happen, is manpower. I know I said that unemployment is vastly reduced so you&#x27;d expect the costs of this experience to go way up, given that i.e. the kitchen cleanup staff, currently paid next to nothing, would become far more expensive, _BUT_, that just means that in the short term this restaurant (A) has a much bigger % of the total running costs dedicated to salary now, and (B) because everyone is still spending a larger % of the fewer dollars they made, is richer and looking to invest in the future.<p>Add to this the fact that society is busy embracing the idea that nobody should work a minute longer than absolutely necessary, and no longer obsessed with trying to ensure work exists for all able-bodied adults, and... robots!<p>I reread what I&#x27;ve written and it comes across as rather dramatic, but efficient cleaning machines already exist, and a couple of high-caliber restaurants already have them. They are just expensive, and in the current climate, not worth it because you can get any sap working nights and overtime for the change in your couch cushions right now. But not in this new model. And _THAT_ is eventually how everyone works less and yet gets more luxury: More efficiency.<p>Everywhere I look, I see rampant opportunities for orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency, and yet at the same time a society and workforce model that actively resists the change. We can automate deliveries easily, but, there&#x27;s resistance. Tesla and google auto-drive cars are being bound by laws, some no doubt because of honest questions about their safety, but a lot of them, I bet, due to some lobbying by various interested parties. Manufacture of goods could be far more efficient, but there&#x27;s simply no drive to invest in any of it. Everyone drives a car, and yet even in places where you could feasibly move to a society where almost nobody owns a car and all you got is a very expansive public transit system and a couple of ZIP-car / greenwheels / etc style locations... that change is not happening. It would be more convenient for all and cost far less (i.e.: big society wins by way of orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency), and it should be possible in dense urban areas like Paris, the greater metropolitan triangle of Rotterdam-The Hague-Amsterdam, London (which is probably the closest to the ideal due to the congestion charge), etc.<p>Also, a lot of expensive hobbies exist, but there are even more cheap hobbies, which provide just about as much happiness for far less cost.

After all, even grandmasters do not bruteforce their way through all possible combinations. We use a hybrid approach: recognize certain strategic patterns first (to drastically narrow down the search tree), and perform calculations on the top of that.<p>Chess engines can wipe the floor with any player where tactics is involved; the trick of beating a computer is to close the game and take advantage of the fact that it&#x27;s not able to formulate a long-term PLAN (whose consequences are beyond its horizon).<p>See how Nakamura repeatedly beat Rybka in blitz games a few years ago, eg.: <a href=""http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1497429"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1497429</a> - very instructive :)",1417522595

There&#x27;s probably several layers of obfuscation applied too, and despite there being very good evidence that e.g. RSA-2048 or some hash function is used, it&#x27;s possible that it was deliberately a diversion from the actual checking that goes on. Transistors are cheap enough to Intel that embedding a complete separate CPU core inside (with a different architecture) to do things like this would be very easy.<p>On the other hand, I wonder how much government agencies know about this mechanism and ways they can make use of it; reverse-engineering the actual process from inspection of the die might take so long that it would never be practical.

That said, they only claim cooling of ~40Wm^-2, corresponding to ~5 degrees below ambient. Realistically, this stuff is most useful when ambient is above ~20-25 degrees (this is when most people want cooling), where the drop in temperature by ~5 degrees shouldn&#x27;t cause too much of a condensation problem. Of course, that&#x27;s just one application.",1417521786

What was its grade?<p>Saying it can beat a terrible player doesn&#x27;t mean much.<p>Saying it can beat Sunfish (a python program with grade of ?maybe ELO 1100? (i.e. not at all strong)) sometimes, when it has a time advantage, is not impressive.<p>I&#x27;d really like to know how much better (if at all) the evaluation function is - e.g. can the program beat itself, if one side uses a &#x27;standard&#x27; evaluation function?<p>Machine Learning is big on measuring outcomes.  It is odd that the one outcome that is important here is not measured!<p>Some caveats:  I realise this is someone&#x27;s hobby project - I do not mean to rubbish it.

8686694,comment,8680765,8684246,0,0,jbergens,,,"I think you should look at a timeframe also. If you write an application today in Angular 1.x you could probably contiue to use it for about 18-24 months. It is really hard to know which frameworks will still be maintained in 24 months time and it is not unheard of rewriting the application anyway after that time. 
As for the actual rewrite from Angular 1.x to 2.x I think Google will create scripts that help with the rewrite making it go much faster than 6 months. They actually have a LOT of internal applications written in Angular 1.x and would probably not want to spend the whole of 2016 rewriting everything.",1417521708

6415733,comment,6414757,6415140,1,0,kls,,,"I kind of figured when I read your comment that you would be down-voted due to the tone you took, but you really do present some good info. That being said I think it comes off as too brash for the HN crowd. Let me see if I can reiterate some of the wisdom in a manner that may convey it little more subtly.<p>One of the points that cloudair is hitting on by saying that she is no snowflake and don&#x27;t build her up is that women do not like a guy that comes off a desperate and incapable of getting a woman. It can border on creepy to them. When you build a woman up in your mind this is what will inevitably happen, it&#x27;s great that you think of her as a goddess but should you act like that around her and act like a lost puppy it is going to turn her off. Not saying you are doing that, but don&#x27;t.<p>The reason cloudair says to play the field is a natural byproduct of playing the field is that you are a little more cool around all women when you are not desperate for the attention of a single women. It sucks but we are human and part of being human are the natural mating signals one of them for a successful man is that other women like him. Women like men that other women like, don&#x27;t ask me why but those are the rules of engagment.<p>He is also right, that the longer you drag this out the more at risk you are of being put in the friend zone. Once a woman has lost desire for a man it is very hard to rekindle it.<p>Women like alpha males. You don&#x27;t have to be a body builder or a ninja to be an Alpha male, what you do have to be though, is confident, respectful, decisive, intelligent and have convictions. Women pick up on these strong traits and have a natural attraction to them. Just as men are attracted to beauty women are attracted to all strengths of a man. Women generally want a man that they can admire for their strengths, be strong when you are around her. Not in a hey look at me lift the front of this car kind of strong but strong in confidence and strong in your opinions, for example don&#x27;t be in to something just because she is into it, women have radar for when men are faking it and it&#x27;s a huge turn off for them, they read it as weakness and patronizing and it can be read as desperation.<p>Tease her in a fun but aggravating way, kind of like you would a kid sister. You need to be fun. People want to be with people they have fun with. Every time you are with her you should make it a point to make the environment fun, even if it is just the two of you. This goes back to being a alpha male. Women like men that are the life of the party. If you are introverted that does not mean you have to do keg stands, but it does mean you need to make an effort to socialize and place both of you in fun environments.<p>She sounds like a catch, just try not to build her up in your mind it&#x27;s the worst thing you can do. That does not mean you should be rude to her but you need to treat her like a person that you enjoy spending time with not like an golden idol. Good luck and please update us on how it all works out.",1379645961

Just take a look for the MPTCP patches in Linus&#x27;s kernel. You won&#x27;t find them. Here&#x27;s my kernel git repo; origin is Linus&#x27;s repo, mptcp is the MPTCP development repo:<p><pre><code>  $ git log --pretty=oneline origin/master..mptcp/mptcp_v0.87 | wc -l\n       2841\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, there are 2841 patches in the mptcp_v0.87 branch that are not in the kernel repo, all the way back to the original shim6 patch that was used to start building MPTCP on top of shim6, which was a proposal for multi-homed IPv6 (MPTCP now works on top of IPv4 as well).<p>Note that when you look at the &quot;installing on Linux&quot; instructions, they mention running it in a virtual machine.<p>This is not terribly uncommon for an ambitious research effort; work on an out of tree fork for a while, and then when it&#x27;s ready, propose it for inclusion into the upstream kernel. For a recent example, see Bcache <a href=""http://bcache.evilpiepirate.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bcache.evilpiepirate.org/</a>, which was developed out of tree for several years before being merged a few months ago.<p>> Please don&#x27;t say things so scary without looking into it.<p>Why do you find this scary?<p>And why do you think that I didn&#x27;t look into this?",1379645961

The faster you are going, the smaller the delta in speeds, the less likely you are to be hit, and the less likely you are to die from the impact when you are hit.  Driving at lower speeds because you are worried about the cars in the oncoming lane puts you at greater risk to the greater threat.

Rust combines the best features of C and functional programming and through a very clever pointer system manages to eliminate race conditions, null pointers and dangling pointers at compile time. It has a powerful type system and smart type inference. It&#x27;s possible to have some memory be garbage collected, but by default it isn&#x27;t so it can be used for tasks that prohibit garbage collection. The compiler ensures that freed memory will never be accessed. It&#x27;s built for modern parallel hardware and offers tons of concurrency features, like lightweight tasks, actors, async, etc. Its structs are compatible with C and Rust can integrate seamlessly with C code and librairies. It compiles to native using LLVM. It&#x27;s backed by a major non-profit, Mozilla. It&#x27;s a fantastic project and it seems to have all the right cards to be the perfect alternative to C++.<p>Check it out. My only disappointment (and the reason why I&#x27;m not using it seriously at the moment) is that because the language is still in development, it changes extremely fast and 80% of the documentation online is wrong and won&#x27;t compile.

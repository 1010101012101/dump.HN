2254226,comment,2252152,2253842,0,0,jokermatt999,,,"What about disabling voting until a user reaches a certain amount of karma? Of course, you'd have to give the upvote ability to the original members (hand selected?) so that the system could actually get off the ground.<p>It would be similar to the ""invite only"" community idea where older users have to actually approve new members, but less restrictive. Perhaps even have upvotes on <i>users</i> instead of just comments. It would be similar to an ""invite"", but just for allowing them to vote. I'd say also keep the hellbanning that we have here. There will sadly be some false positives, but it seems to work very well for keeping out the worst.<p>Perhaps upvoting users could affect the reputation of the folks doing the upvoting. If you upvote a bad user into the community, your reputation suffers as well.<p>Now, this does nothing to solve the problem of groupthink, and in fact somewhat enforces it. However, I think some amount of groupthink is inevitable if you want to create a strong sense of community. Because you're <i>trying</i> to cluster users around a core set of values, it's probable that they'll think similarly in other ways as well.<p>Edit: I think multidimensional voting helps as well. Ignoring the comments voted ""funny"" on /. helps to filter out what people liked just because it was amusing. I think ""agree/disagree"" voting would be useful as a separate thing, because too often that winds up conflicting with upvoting/downvoting for quality.",1298472986

2254224,comment,2253897,2253897,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"What the the article seems to miss is that Scala <i>can</i> be used strictly as a ""better Java"" without using any of the advanced type features or idioms if that is what you want.<p>(Anecdotal)War Story: Once upon a time I worked with a team of scientists (not professional developers) who had some legacy research code in Java, had tried moving to Scala and got badly bitten by the advanced type theory bits and so were considering  moving back to Java. When I joined the team I taught them how to use the ""Scala as a better Java"" approach, (which would correspond to approximately the L1 level in Martin Odersky's blog post at <a href=""http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8610"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8610</a>)  and to this day they are happily building new stuff in Scala (and Java).<p>Just as you can use Common Lisp without completely mastering macros, the condition system etc, to get stuff done at the cost of some redundancy when compared to what the code would look like if an expert were to write it, so can you use subsets of Scala to get serious work done.<p>I suspect problems arise when you have the attitude that you must completely master the language before you start using it to build stuff. This excludes all but the ultra simple languages from consideration. Reductio Ad Absurdum, Imagine a world where the only programming language in use is VB (or even C) !<p>I offer the hypothesis that when using any <i>new</i> <i>and</i> ""large"" language on a real life project you have to work with a subset. This is not a bad thing and ""subset"" is not a dirty word (as long as the subset is clearly identified and at least as good as the alternative languages).  As you gain experience with the subset and actually build useful systems with it you can then go deeper into the language and learn more advanced features, which you can then use to refactor your code to use those advanced features where appropriate, in a virtuous cycle.<p>Imagine you are learning a non programming language (say French) or even musical notation. If you wait till you have wrapped your head completely around whatever you are learning before you start using it, you are (a) going to wait a long time (b) very unusual in your approach. Is having an ultra simple syntax or a small surface area a virtue? Yes it is. It is <i>one</i> aspect of a design but not the only one.<p>The lack of an IDE is a more valid complaint, (especially if you plan to have big teams of mediocre programmers) but then you restrict yourself to using only core mainstream languages with very strong vendor ecosystems (say Java, VC++, C# and VB). It would be nice if every new language sprang from their creators brows fully equipped with ultra functional IDEs but that maybe a tad unrealistic a wish ;-).<p>I also suspect that most of the carping comes from people who haven't actually used Scala in any serious fashion. Complaints  about ""too complex a type system""  from people who have never used Scala to actually build something have about as much legitimacy as people who refuse to use Lisp because it has ""too many parantheses"" and just ""know"" that parantheses are confusing.",1298472931

They are not bounded in any ways to do more than that. Telling you why means they have to think, to sit down and write more than a sentence. It's easier to just give a canned answer and send it out.<p>All the outer explanation of legal ramification, hard to provide feed back, it's just smoke screen to cover the most basic human nature to be lazy. Period.<p>Personally I've had good feedback 1 in every 50 application I sent. I've always proactively asked for feedback when I can and I think I've probably had 3 good feedbacks so far.

2254206,comment,2252152,2254121,0,0,_delirium,,,"I sort of agree, but I meant it a bit tongue-in-cheek (hence the smiley). I'm sure plenty of people would argue that the Kuro5hin golden age was nothing like the WELL golden age, or the Usenet golden age, or various other possibilities.<p>One thing I did like about the Kuro5hin model was discussion organized around original, substantive stories, written by the same userbase who were the commenters. That, and stories posted at a rate of one or two a day. Sites like Slashdot/HN/reddit are instead mainly based around discussing offsite links, which K5 allowed but sort of discouraged as ""mindless link propagation"" (there was a section for it, but people didn't want too many submissions to it, and you typically had to add some substantive commentary to the link to get the submission accepted). The articles were also directly written for / targeted to the K5 community. People do sometimes write blog posts specifically to target HN, but they're often more multitargeted--- stuff submitted here might not be written with an HN audience in mind at all, or HN might only be one of several intended audiences.<p>Some classic Usenet groups were sort-of in that style as well. You <i>could</i> start a new thread with a one-line post or ""what do you think of this?"" query, but some groups had a culture of starting new threads only when you had a significant, well-thought out post to make; otherwise you were supposed to stick to existing threads.<p>I'm afraid it's harder to attract good content to a community these days, though. The people who used to consistently write good stuff for Kuro5hin now have their own blogs, and post their content there instead. In the early 2000s, it was a win-win situation: Kuro5hin provided an outlet for people who had things to say, and people who had things to say provided interesting content to read and discuss. These days if you have something compelling to say, you can just start a blog, and then try to get readers by submitting links across the web.",1298472434

1664287,comment,1664004,1664004,0,0,andolanra,,,"The research this seems to be discussing is at least partly described in ""Language status and hemispheric involvement in reading: Evidence from trilingual Arabic speakers tested in Arabic, Hebrew, and English"" by Raphiq Ibrahim and Zohar Eviatar. So far, I haven't been able to turn up a copy, so I'll just list my non-neuroscientist questions and concerns. I don't mean that I don't believe it necessarily; just that I have trouble accepting a lot of these statements without further qualification and discussion.<p>- Lateralization of brain function is a tricky business, because it's prone to exaggeration and urban legend. I'd like some clear citations for statements like, ""When you are starting something new, there is a lot of [right hemisphere] involvement.""<p>- Given the preceding statement, I'd also like some clear citations for ""When the eyes see something for just a short time, and it is at one side of a screen, only one brain hemisphere is quick enough to process the image."" When I first read this sentence, it made sense to me, but things which appeal to common sense are not necessarily true.<p>- What are the actual rates of recognition for the letters by the different speakers and for the different hemispheres? Was it really an all-or-nothing result, or was it a 49%-or-%51 result?<p>- Because this experiment (apparently) only tested individual letters, how does one take into account the fact that Arabic letters change their form in various parts of a word? Perhaps Arabic words are easier to read than Hebrew words because the letters, when put together, have a more recognizable shape than Hebrew letters, which have a more uniform outline. Would right-brain recognition of Arabic words vs. Hebrew words yield different results than the individual letters?<p>- Arabic is widely spoken in Israel, but what percentage of the Arabic speakers were native Arabic speakers who learned Hebrew later in life, and what percentage were native Hebrew speakers who learned Arabic later in life? How much later in life?<p>- Arabic typeset on a computer can differ radically from calligraphic Arabic and handwritten Arabic. What variety was tested? Would handwritten Arabic (which generally uses lines instead of dots for diacritics) aid or hinder understanding?<p>In general, science news prepared by non-scientific sources leaves out a lot of detail, but these are questions which I think could have a lot of bearing on the truth of this experiment.",1283680044

Setting tasks that are within reach but will stretch his ability (and getting his buy-in on the idea before you start)<p>2. Teaching him how to find the answers to his own questions<p>I'd do all the setup yourself so the kid can jump straight in to producing something. I'd use FTP as it's easy to conceptualize. Avoid the command line and version control.<p>I'd start with HTML (written in Notepad) so that you can learn to present any data output. Just teach basic tags: h1, p, table, a href. Use w3schools for reference. Build something like a 'My Family' website with a page for each family member and links to the others.<p>Then maybe stir in a bit of CSS - again just basic stuff (colors, borders, positioning) and again using w3schools for reference. Use this to make the My Family website a bit prettier.<p>Then try some PHP/MySQL. You could save each family member in a table and use one PHP file to display each one based on an id specified as a get var.<p>Simple project ideas to try after that could be a simple CMS or (my favourite) a very basic Twitter clone.",1283679292

1664266,comment,1664004,1664213,0,0,mahmud,,,"The development of logic in the Islamic world has little to do with the Arabic language and everything to do with Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), and the conquest of settled, sedentary peoples in Persia, the Roman occupied Levant and Anatolia.<p>Suddenly, Arabs found themselves heirs to great empires and custodians of far richer cultures than their own. The recent converts had to be immersed in the culture with something other than eloquent oration and rhetoric, as was the custom back in Arabia, since few of them spoke Arabic much less appreciated its word-craft. The converts themselves were running around interpreting Islam in their old, familiar ways; the Persians, subservient to their God-Kings would have idolized the new Arabs. Arab families from the inner-circle were vying for power, and old clan conflicts were beginning to threaten the new Caliphate.<p>It was during this period of economic stability, but cultural chaos that Islamic scholars rediscovered* pockets of philosophical cults: Gnostics, Neoplatonists, Aristotelians, and various Christian offshoots, all off whom had highly developed systems of inquiry and exposition. These fringe groups were learned men who saw wisdom not only in Christian teachings, the state-sponsored religion, but also in the old teachings of sages and thinkers of antiquity.<p>That's when Islam discovered Logic and fell in love. Unlike Rome, logic didn't threaten their religion because they believed their holly book was infallible; and the thought of man, once elevated, can only be in agreement with what God said, and if wrong, the error lay with man.<p>The Caliphs threw scholarships at researchers and sent them digging in the books. First, it was a period of translation, followed by active search for lost Greek sources, and finally, once the attic dried, new research and development.<p>Within 30 years of first contact, in Baghdad and Basra, Mecca and Madina; Logic, Rhetoric, Music, and Geometry were in school curricula, along with Quran. And the new students, learned in native Arabic and oblivious to translation, ran with the sciences and developed them, as any of their many indigenous crafts.",1283678464

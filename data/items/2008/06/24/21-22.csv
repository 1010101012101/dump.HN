If my calendar says ""create presentation,"" though, by all means fire up Keynote just in time for it to be ready and waiting to receive my input.<p>My favorite songs can already follow me from my living room to my kitchen--I have very loud speakers. I want them to follow me <i>from my car</i>. Either by a pair of cooperating satellite radio devices, a pair of 4G devices streaming from my online music library account, or more likely just an MP3 player that, upon being unplugged, scans for wifi audio speakers to start streaming to (with the possible optimization that if it finds the computer it syncs with, it can just command it to start playing the track where it left off, then shut itself off.)<p>The phone should have already told me what it needed to tell me when it was in my pocket; however, now that I take my cell into my home, I should be able to answer the line of my cellphone's number on my home phone lines (without an additional plan, and perhaps cheaper because it doesn't have to connect to a cell tower but can instead ride my coax). My phone's (both cell and land, and perhaps work as well) e-mail inbox should be my computer's e-mail inbox. I should be able to use my cellphone as an extra screen, speaker, and microphone for any and all of my computers, both over Bluetooth and securely connected remotely.<p>My computers themselves should be able to intelligently know where I am, locking themselves when I'm not sitting at them, and unlocking when I sit down (unless they detect someone on the blacklist is also in the room with me--then I'll need to use a password.) They should wake up when they detect my voice (even from a different room, depending on what is said), just as if I'd moved the mouse or pressed a key.<p>I should be able to use my cellphone to send hand gestures to devices from anywhere, as if it was a Wiimote.<p>And the fridge really should have messaged me about the milk <i>when I was in the store;</i> that's why I carry the GPS locator, after all. It's too late now. Maybe it could message one of my friends who is planning to come over that they could do me a favor and pick it up if they're close.",1214344113

226864,comment,226352,226562,0,0,lux,,,"Regarding #1, there's definitely no complete winner out there yet so being on all of them is the best a band can do.  Services like cdbaby.com propagate your tracks to dozens of such services (44 in all currently including iTunes, amiestreet.com, etc.) and also take care of other things for you like selling physical discs online and taking credit cards from sales at concerts, so that's probably the best thing going for a band right now.  And once a clear winner in the online music sales appears, cdbaby.com will I'm sure also deal with them too on your behalf.<p>And as a comparison of profits from something like iTunes, I've heard major label artists make less than $1 on their digital album sales, and pennies on the song, whereas through the cdbaby.com submission to iTunes I get paid about $0.64 per song (up to $0.89 for a sale on iTunes UK after currency conversion!) or $6+/album.<p>For #2, I guess that's where booking and promo agencies come in, but they only tend to work with artists once they've built a following and can get people out to the gigs they set up.<p>In either case though, the only benefit added by major labels is advertising dollars (which also amounts to mainstream radio airplay, very hard to get without a major).  This is basically VC for the music industry if you look at it that way.  So maybe just getting some angel investors interested in your band might be a better approach too...",1214343725

All the locations, characters, monsters and weapons are colorful and unique.  Look at any screenshot and chances are you can tell at a glance WHERE in the game world it is - that's not true for many games out there.\n- Blizzard has perfected an effort/reward system more finely tuned and addictive than that of any other company out there.  It started in Diablo and they perfected it in Diablo II - WoW is just a continuation.  Advancing is easier than in other games, but you know that the next reward is just around the corner so you play ""just 5 more minutes"".  In addition, the rewards somehow avoid being repetitive - it doesn't feel like you're just replacing a 5 with a 6 somewhere, like in other games.  As another poster mentioned, it's incredibly Pavlovian.\n- Something for everyone.  WoW actually manages to be engaging for both casual and hardcore players, for two friends or a couple playing together and for a large clan who know each other from previous games.<p>I don't think Blizzard put in any really innovative ideas in WoW, but their execution was far, far beyond what anyone else has done.

226856,comment,226657,226657,0,0,henning,,,"I play WoW about 20+ hours a week (Selecta on Spirestone) and I have played through most of the pre-expansion pack content, so let me comment on this from personal experience.<p>Things that make WoW successful are part of many good games:<p>1) Feelings of accomplishment - you come back to a character every time that you yourself built up. The persistent nature of the game (rather than a first person shooter where every game is a blank slate) is compelling.<p>2) Working with others to achieve a common goal - it's fun to team up with people and take on hard bosses that none of you could defeat individually, or even in smaller groups. The later stages of the game feature god-like foes that require dozens of people working in very, very tight cooperation to defeat, or else <i>everyone</i> will certainly be killed (Sunwell Plateau, etc.). In other words, 50 people randomly banging on the harder bosses will not suffice because the bosses are so powerful they can simply divide and conquer. It really is challenging.<p>Many games have those qualities. What makes WoW better than them?<p>Well, basically WoW corrected a lot of EverQuest's flaws. That's basically it. They had the second-comer advantage in that. It had Blizzard's name behind it, too (Starcraft, Diablo - both highly successful franchises in their own right).<p>Plus, there's a real in-game economy, with a value-added chain and everything (gather or buy raw materials -> turn them into a valuable item -> sell the valuable item at a higher price than the cost of the materials). The game's currency is valuable even up to high levels in the game (although there are many guilds sitting on hundreds of thousands of gold with nothing to really spend it on -- it doesn't scale <i>that</i> high). But, it is definitely valuable to have thousands and thousands of gold.<p>You can't easily ""replicate"" something you have absolutely no comprehension of.<p>Don't fucking try to treat it like a business application, because it isn't.",1214343350
226855,comment,226510,226510,0,0,LPTS,,,"People who are concerned this is a fad have some legitimate concerns.<p>But, they are at risk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  This diagnosis opens up an incredibly insightful way of understanding much of human culture, history, and art.  It is pretty easy to link up certain archetypes to aspergers syndrome.  The Romantic Hero, for example, or the Shaman both read like descriptions of Asperger's as manifested in a certain societal context.  This could partly be because storytellers often are Aspergian themselves and the characteristic identity diffusion leads Aspergian people both create idolized versions of themselves, study their world intently, and project themselves (and their aspergian traits) onto the stories of their culture.  The greek god Hermes often presents as Aspergian (in that he is concerned with information, started technology, in the form of music, as an infant, relates to travel, never stays in the same place, etc).  The lack of concern for societal norms maps perfectly onto the trickster's taboo breaking.  Jesus at twelve in the temple speaking to priests as an authority mirrors Dr. Hans Asperger's description of his patients as ""little professors"".  It's fractally recursive throughout human history.<p>This concept also cast light deep into the edifice of academic philosophy, in that many philosophers had asperger's syndrome and changed philosophies about the same time in their lives.  Kant developed transcendental Idealism.  Wittgenstein abandoned his picture theory of words.  Etc.  This correlates with a change in Asperger's whereby around age 40 the Aspergian or autistic aspects soften, and some measure of reciprocity is added to the personality, and relates to observed changes in the brain.  Understanding Wittgenstein's picture theory in light of the difficulties of aspergers illuminates both aspergers and the reasons Wittgenstein's theory was the way it was.  At a meta level, one of the next tasks in at least AI and consciousness studies, will be to disentangle autistic and non autistic theories about consciousness.  This could also shed light into AI, because Aspergian or Autistic people doing AI with an impaired theory of other minds won't succeed, and will make certain characteristic errors in their reasoning rooted in the way Asperger's projects onto their academic work.<p>Some people say that everyone is a unique little snowflake and so special and that these boxes can't be applied easily or posthumously and blah blah.  Those people are idiots.  You are not a unique little snowflake, and are not special.  Without exception (for any 'you') You are an instantiation of the same patterns that millions of other people instantiate, with a few superficial differences you probably confuse for a unique and indescribable soul, and it's easy for the right person to put you in a box and label you (and manipulate the hell out of you if they want, eg, advertising and marketing).  Asperger's and HFA present distinctly.  You actually can make pretty valid diagnosis of something so characteristic even posthumously.  We shouldn't avoid interpreting history this way because it destroys peoples pathetic illusion's that they are special and impossible to pin down.<p>This is the kind of thing where understanding it at the surface will be deceiving, but understanding deeply will be illuminating.  The way most people understand this is wrong, but understanding  Asperger's as it relates to human culture will enhance most people's understanding of the world deeply.",1214343336

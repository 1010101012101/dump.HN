5408966,comment,5407369,5407369,15,0,davidroberts,,,"I left the news business in 1983, from a major metropolitan daily. I was coming in at 1 pm, writing three business stories a day to a 6 pm deadline, then staying until 9 pm supervising the layout of the business pages. Honestly, many of the business stories were junk (how could they not be at little more than an hour apiece?). Typically one would be a rewrite of a wire story, one would be a rewrite of a corporate press release, and one would consist of calling the same stock market ""experts"" after the market closed for their pontifications on why the market moved the way it did that day: ""Well, the market appears to be heading for a correction as buyers anticipate poor results in tomorrow's housing starts report..."" I'd see almost the same words from the same guys on the wire and in the other major dailies. I'm sure they were making it all up on the spot.<p>I always had a couple side stories I was working on that would take a week or so, and now and then I'd go out to do a business profile, which tended to be something of an advertisement for the business in question. I'd interview the owner or president, look around the place, talk to a few employees. But at least it was something like journalism. But with the intense deadline pressure during my regular work day, I mainly did the work for these in the morning on my own time.<p>There were some fun times though. There was the night when our hometown team won the Superbowl, and all the reporters stayed late watching the results come in. That night I drove through streets packed with celebrating people to get photos taken by our man on the scene from the AP office across town. Election nights were great too, with free food in the conference room and the whole staff feverishly compiling results until the front page closed at midnight.<p>And there was a sense of power too. All I had to do was say ""I'm a reporter for the XYZ Times,"" and the company president or the head staffer in the Congressman's office would be eager to talk to me.<p>Thirty years ago was supposed to be the glory days of print journalism, but already papers were closing and reporters losing their jobs. A running joke in the newsroom underscored our basic anxiety about the future: ""What's a journalist? A reporter looking for work.""<p>I lost my job after my mentor, the managing editor who shepherded me through the political minefield of the editorial staff, got sick and took a six-month leave of absence, leaving me at the mercy of the ambitious deputy managing editor.<p>One day the business editor, my immediate boss, called me into his office and told me I was being transferred to a sister publication of tiny circulation in another town, but that was actually a lie. The truth became apparent when I was called before the deputy managing editor. He actually ran the newspaper since the editor-in-chief was a figurehead hired for his name alone. The managing editor who had mentored me was long gone. ""How does it feel to be fired?"" were the first words he said. I gathered my stuff and walked out. I went back to school for a grad degree and never looked back.",1363802317

5408931,comment,5407319,5408652,2,0,larrys,,,"Similar - I was an early adopter of ""desktop publishing"". I was in the printing business and part of doing printing was doing typesetting. For that we had dedicated machines with terminals and large floppy drives which output on photographic paper which needed to be processed chemically. The first machine I bought (Itek) used light shining through a plastic font. Each font cost $40 (iirc) and for each variation (say, bold, once again iirc) you needed a different plastic piece.<p>Anyway in along with the first mac a bit later came the laserwriter and customers started using that for camera ready copy (canarie in the coal mine was only 300dpi way below photographic quality). Later linotype built a rip that could interface a Mac 512k (iirc) with the linotype (about 1985). I spent almost 6 figures on a linotype and became a service bureau. The minute I saw that you could draw a box on a Mac around type (with traditional systems you needed to essentially program this) I knew what would happen. That said I was in my 20's most others in my business didn't see it the same way since they were older.<p>Parent commenter - what was  the age of your father at the time he had this revelation?",1363801966

There are many reasons to favor OS-based virtualization over hardware-based virtualization, but first among these (in my opinion) is DRAM utilization:  with OS-based virtualization, all unused DRAM is available to the system at large, and in the SmartOS case is used as adaptive replacement cache (ARC) that benefits all tenants.  Given that few tenants consume every byte of their allocated DRAM, this alone leads to huge efficiencies from both the perspective of the cloud operator and the cloud user -- a higher-performing, higher-margin service.  By contrast, for hardware-based virtualization, unused DRAM remains with the guest and is simply wasted (kludges like kernel samepage mapping and memory ballooning notwithstanding).<p>DRAM isn't the only win, of course:  for every other resource in the system (CPU, network, disk), OS-based virtualization offers tremendous (and insurmountable) efficiency advantages over hardware-based virtualization -- and it's great to see others make the same realization!<p>For more details on the relative performance of OS-based virtualization, hardware-based virtualization and para-virtualization, see my colleague Brendan Gregg's excellent blog post on the subject[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2013/01/11/virtualization-performance-zones-kvm-xen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2013/01/11/virtualization-pe...</a>",1363801396

Features were proposed, scrutinized, whittled down, and often smote completely, leaving us with a lean and mean product reflecting the greatest characteristics of collaboration and compromise.<p>At the end of the weekend, we submitted an iPhone app that we were all proud of, that we were all excited to get out to the public, and most importantly, that we were all completely engrossed in using ourselves. Finally, now, we can share that app with you.

What they always assume though is that the developer makes a US sized salary (in parts of the world, $500/month IS a nice salary). Or they assume he someone is even paid in the first place (think a ramen startup, a university student deep in debt wanting to launch something on the cheap etc).<p>- Second, people might like to write a game in Ruby, a number-crunching app, a drawing app, etc. Why be constrained by the language and need to employ another for the critical parts? This puts a barrier to a programmer (in code complexity, in having 2 codebases, in time needed to manage memory and such). Barriers mean: you can do fewer interesting stuff than what could be possible.<p>><i>The way that I see it, Ruby exchanges execution time for programmer time.</i><p>Sure, by why it has to be that way? Nothing inherent in dynamic languages make it so. Of course they will be slower than C, but they can be 10 or 20 times faster than what they are NOW.<p>Pure V8, Smalltalk VMs, JVM languages etc are consistently much faster than pure (no C delegation) Ruby or Python.

The process isolation, also called namespaces, is important because it prevents a process from seeing or terminating other running processes.<p>lxc: this is a utility that glues together cgroups and chroots to provide virtualization. It helps you easily setup a guest OS by downloading your favorite distro and unpacking it (kind of like debootstrap). It can then ""boot"" the guest OS by starting it's ""init"" process. The init process runs in its own namespace, inside a chroot. This is why they call LXC a chroot on steroids. It does everything that chroot does, with full process isolation and metering.<p>aufs: this is sometimes called a ""stacked"" file system. It allows you to mount one file system on top of another. Why is this important? Because if you are managing a large number of virtual machines, each one with 1GB+ OS, it uses a lot of disk space. Also, the slowest part of creating a new container is copying the distro (can take up to 30 seconds). Using something like AUFS gives you much better performance.<p>So what about security? Well, like every (relatively) new technology LXC has its issues. If you use Ubuntu 12.04 they provide a set of Apparmor scripts to mitigate known security risks (like disabling reboot or shutdown commands inside containers, and write access to the /sys filesystem).",1363800677

My wife openly admits that she prefers male bosses. Personally, I've had as many good female managers than I have male. Here is what I have noticed though:<p>Women hate each other. With a passion. Even their ""friends"".  I also think women have a very under-developed (okay, let's concede ""different"") idea of conflict, at least when compared to men, and I think it is evolutionary.<p>Men seem to me to be able to ""team bond"" almost instantly, perform a high level of conflict engagement with very defined ""rules"" (whether on the sports field, the boardroom or even combat itself). Within this arena, men are ruthless assholes at the best of times, and downright immoral at the worst. But almost always in support of the team - those that act otherwise are ostracized. After the conflict though, men revert to a rest state where the actions of the conflict are almost immediately discarded to a simply won/lost equation. Strangely enough, women that either prefer or can adapt to this environment seem to excel.<p>Women though in almost every case seem to approach this situation in the exact opposite fashion: team bonding takes forever, and can be shattered by something as simple as a perceived slight at first introduction, women limit their actions within the arena, and the events that occur during the conflict are remembered almost forever.  I've seen 10 year friendships end over something as simple as not properly crediting someone enough during a boardroom presentation.<p>I think it all goes back to the caveman days - men needed to find allies fast to tackle that mammoth, or ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" when the threat was more human. Women needed to be much more guarded - everyone who wasn't a long term immediate family member was a threat to the tribe, and even then you advance by being with the alpha male, so getting him is the main objective, your sister be damned.<p>But this is just my 5 cents. It's really nothing more than an opinion on the internet. So don't read into it too much.",1363800459

With containers you're relying on the kernel to provide the isolation so you are still subject to (some) kernel level exploits.<p>Practically linux containers (the mainline implementation) have only provided full isolation in recent patches and probably shouldn't be considered full shaken out for something like full in the wild root level multi-tenant access.<p>They are super for application isolation for delivery of multiple single tenant workloads on one machine though - something people use hypervisors for quite a bit.

Most writes are ""set"" operations, which is simply last-write-wins. Well-structured apps can use this for the vast majority of features. For cases where you need multiple clients to modify the same data, we provide a Transaction operation, which ensures the write happens atomically. See:<p><a href=""https://www.firebase.com/docs/transactions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.firebase.com/docs/transactions.html</a><p>2. The service is ready for production apps now, and we have many already (Twitch, Klout, TED, BitTorrent). We have a rigorous test suite, comprehensive, redundant monitoring, data replication, and backups in place. At this point the Beta label is largely there because we haven't built the infrastructure to handle payments yet. You can expect that label to come off in the next few months.",1363800134

Then he built it.  And his niche is hardly unique; there are obviously many more areas like that to mine.  How did he choose a niche?  He didn't do keyword research.

It's not perfect, but it's <i>much</i> better than any other CMS out there for end-users, designers, and developers:<p>* Editing UI is on the front-end -- users just go to the page they want to edit and click on things to edit them, which is much more intuitive than a back-end dashboard<p>* Content on pages is a collection of ""blocks"", so each portion of content on the page can be edited separately (as opposed to one WYSIWYG editor for the whole page). I've even built a free addon that lets designers compose their own custom block interfaces ( <a href=""http://concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/designer-content"" rel=""nofollow"">http://concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/designer-content</a> ), so if you have a ""employee bio block"" (for example), you can have an image chooser, a textbox for a headline, a wysiwyg editor for the description, and a page chooser for a link instead of requiring the user to fidget with alignments, floats, and custom styles in TinyMCE/FCKEditor.<p>* Create themes from your existing design / markup -- the CMS flows around your design as opposed to you having to construct your design around the requirements of the CMS (this is much more of a problem with Drupal than Wordpress, but still gets annoying in WP for non-blog-like designs).<p>* Underlying architecture is fairly sane -- definitely has some idiosyncracies, but nothing like Wordpress (or Drupal or Joomla). There's a simple MVC pattern going on so you separate your model / controller / view code, and the underlying system has a decent ""API"" for working with pages, content, users, files, etc. Also, if you have very customized functionality, you can just create a separate page in your site and tell the system to not do anything... that you will handle everything yourself on that particular page or area of your site.<p>The only downside is that it's not as popular as wordpress so the documentation is lacking and there are not as many free plugins and tutorials available (but hopefully this will continue to change as time goes on).<p>But it has made building CMS-based websites <i>so</i> much more fun for me.

During these two weeks, some learned to program for the first time. All were proficient programmers by the end of the summer.<p>> Incredibly, before they met us, two of our DSP students, juniors, had not been planning to go on to graduate school following their senior year. These two were performing exceptionally well in their current, demaning academic programs and, ironically, made the most direct contributions to the most significant results of the workshop. One went home from the DSP with a surge of confidence, applied to all the top graduate schools and is now in a Ph.D. program on a fellowship. The other wished to become an NSA employee, but we talked her out of joining us right away.

The installation process for Mezzanine requires some Django knowledge.<p>Installing Wordpress on the other hand requires zero PHP knowledge. A reasonably intelligent person can teach themselves Wordpress basics in days (the basics of self-hosted Wordpress, selecting a theme, selecting key plug-ins, etc.). No PHP required.<p>With Wordpress, it's not too difficult to select a provider (i.e. Bluehost) and have Wordpress automatically installed within minutes using Simple Script.

What I'm saying is basically that by allowing instantaneous publishing, the web is allowing journalists to ""go to press"" in 3 seconds. There doesn't have to be much thought given to rewrites, or sourcing, or flow, or editorial content. In fact, I'd argue that the more time the modern journalist spends doing these things is a disadvantage.<p>Of course the web eventually sorts it all out: it's wrong a bunch but the correct story eventually makes it. But we're losing something. This is very similar to the comments made by old-timey C++ programmers looking at modern OO IDEs. Yes, you can do things really fast, but you're also losing an important part of the craft by doing it this way.<p>In my opinion these two roles, which of course could be performed by the same person, are separating. Long-format, well-edited work is going down a separate path than what we would consider traditional journalism. Beats me where it ends up. I don't think there will be a journalism platform built. This isn't a money problem. This is a structural problem. Technology has pulled apart the instantaneous recording of events from the polished presentation of ""news""",1363799129

So measures designed to help women succeed, like pairing them up with women mentors within the organization, can actually be counter-productive because those women are statistically less likely to be the ones with real power in the organization.<p>That being said, much of what is often cynically ascribed to ""cattiness"" between women is better understood as a reaction to the power dynamic. My wife used to hold the same opinion as the author--she hated the idea of working for a woman. She held this idea until she worked at an organization where her department had a critical mass of powerful women, from the top with women partners that brought in their own business, down the ranks to women who were senior associates and ran their cases, etc. She discovered that there was very little friction between the women in the organization, and indeed a lot of camaraderie, because women were not in the minority within the power dynamic. When the women who had seniority also had real power within the organization, when they were no longer the self-conscious minority, they were freed to become good mentors without having to constantly worry about protecting their own turf.<p>This is one of the reason I'm quite skeptical of people who argue we should be ""gender blind."" The fact that women are a minority in many fields is something that by itself perpetuates the disparity between men and women. In this context, affirmative action measures are not sexist because they don't help women because they are women, but because they are in the minority within the power structure.",1363798882

116732,comment,116708,116708,0,0,arooni,,,"Here are my notes:<p>* The error page seemed a bit cramped (I tried things like entering A points, or -3 points)<p>* Your Current Bid: 36 points. Bid More! (What does this mean?  I'd like a breakdown of which gift cards I selected, rather than a running total.  This information seems to be lost).<p>* I don't see how: <a href=""http://99b600c6.fb.joyent.us/how-to-win.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://99b600c6.fb.joyent.us/how-to-win.html</a> explains that ""The more you bid, the more likely you are to win a prize today. Your prize vote increases the likelihood of that prize being awarded today.""  In fact, it seems to contradict what you say on your ""How it works page"": ""At the end of the day (Midnight Eastern) we collect all of the bids made throughout the da"" ... (i.e. to prizes are always awarded, and do not correspond to the # of bids placed)....Plus that URL looks spammy for some reason (even though it's not)<p>* Your button after bidding says: ""« Go back to Easy Money, and Bid More or Get More Points!"" ... but I can't see how I'd get any more points.  Sigh.<p>* I happen to hate the ads use Facebook style buttons to assault me with (that you see after you make a bid): ""You Have 1 New Message Someone On Your Friends List Has A SECRET CRUSH on You. Find Out Who! www.Crushmessage.com""<p>* I like how you're not sure what gift card you'll get.  Keeps it exciting and I think would cause people to want to invite others to bid on the gift card they want.<p>* As a counterpoint to above... I'd think that the more people got invited to this app, the less likely I am to win anything.  So what's my incentive for sharing this with friends?  Perhaps you could have a mechanism to give me more points for inviting users (or get a constant 10 point override whenever one of my friends whom I invited places a bid)<p>* Ok NOW I see that you did exatly what I mentioned above.  However I had to click on the ""Learn more about this game »"" to find out that I could invite friends for more points.  The invite friends and the more points div seems to be buried at the bottom right.<p>* So I just invited a friend, and I didn't get my 25 points as a referral.  :( Sigh.  If you're going to put restrictions on when my 25 points are rewarded, as I'm guessing you're doing (perhaps only when the user actually signs up as opposed to me sending the invite), you should let users know that clearly (which you currently don't do).<p>* Oh and even if I do invite a friend, its a net loss for me.  I get 25 more points one-time, but my friend gets 50 points to bid... Assuming they bid, I'll be less likely to win anything.  Plus if they continue to bid day after day, I'll just be even more in the hole.<p>* I'd like to see a better countdown clock than a simple, static string: ""Feb. 15, 2008 - 6h, 17m Remaining""... make it dynamic and thus more exciting.<p>That's all I have for now.  Good luck with the launch!",1203115417

116723,comment,116688,116688,0,0,omakase,,,"""Can I just take some good ones and modify them?""<p>I think that's the best approach. Look for similar sites/services or find a few that together do the things you do and copy bits and pieces from their TOS/privacy policy/etc. Depending on what you are doing that is probably good enough until you get some traction. If you take funding down the road I imagine this will all get rewritten for you.",1203114059

I don't need to keep up to date on password hashing techniques, or worry about sending passwords in the clear.<p>As a user, I can improve my login security unilaterally; I can use a hardware token without every site I use needing to implement support for it. As a user, sites that want as much control as you seem to scare me.<p>I think it's too early to say what the marketing/tech support/social effects will be. Clearly nobody is going to use OpenID for Really Important Stuff in the near future, but there are a lot of use cases between toys and RIS.<p>Your last paragraph coming true is a very real risk, and it would disappoint me tremendously. In the meantime, I think  that OpenID shows a lot of promise.<p>edit: We're coming at this from different angles. OpenID will first be adopted by (is being adopted by) small sites that don't care about the things that you do. Bug trackers, wikis, forums, blogs, sites like this one. Once it's well established there, then we can start talking about the kind of sites you're talking about.",1203113617

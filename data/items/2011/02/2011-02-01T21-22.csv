2167617,comment,2165751,2166609,0,0,lukesandberg,,,"i don't have a lot of experience with vanilla GWT, but i have been using vaadin a lot lately and it is very frustrating to look at the (bloated) html that vaadin generates and not to be able to do anything about it (without designing new widgetsets).<p>Also i have found with vaadin the client side rendering times can be a problem.  ( though my whole team is new with vaadin so there's a good chance that that is our fault)<p>I definitely see the appeal of vaadin, but i think that ultimately its not the paradigm you want for web application development.  I think that for many cases you really need to know exactly what will run on the client side and what will run on the server.<p>Back when i was doing lots of silverlight development there was a very clear division between the client side and server side code.  However, because they were both implemented in the same language i was able to factor out shared components (models mostly) into seperate projects that i could individually compile for both sides (for smaller chunks of functionality such as some socket protocol validtion code i just linked the files into multiple projects).  This allowed for good reuse as well as good seperation.  I think that this is ultimately what you want: the ability to share some code between both sides not to blur the line completely.",1296597583

When you have a light source with a funky spectrum, this can cause colors to look very strange, as a surface might not reflect a funny, spiky spectrum the same way (w.r.t. the human 3-dimensional color space) it will reflect a smooth color spectrum of the same color.

My perspective is that back in the '90s, I wrote internal desktop apps for corporations when the web came along, setting back the user experience a decade (at least). Web apps have only recently begun to offer the kind of user experience that desktop apps provide. Because of this, I was surprised when web apps won, and won so quickly and thoroughly. But it turns out that the user's experience - although important, and especially so for consumer apps - is only one of many factors that drive technology adoption, even in the consumer market.<p>Certainly 37Signals might pick up some users with smoother client apps, but at least for the time being, they have to balance that against the cost of developing those apps. My guess is that most users will care about clunky HTML vs. smooth native apps about as much as they cared about clunky HTML vs. smooth native apps back in '98.

2167536,comment,2166494,2166782,0,0,jacobolus,,,"> <i>something that is pretty simple in reality</i><p>It’s not that simple: explaining it properly takes dozens if not hundreds of pages.<p>> <i>RGB are the primaries in light.</i><p>This depends on what you mean by “primaries”. As far as I can tell, your definition is based on common color reproduction technologies, rather than the physiology of human visual perception. That’s fine, but recognize then that the “primaries” chosen for practical use are constrained by economic factors, &c. The three best lights for additive color reproduction are indeed R (an orangish red color), G (a yellowish green), and B (a blue-violet color): this is because those are the colors which maximize the differential responses of different cone cells, as can be seen in this diagram in Hunt’s book <i>The Reproduction of Colour</i>: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ZOdZc.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ZOdZc.png</a> Of course, such narrow-spectrum sources are not economically/technically feasible, and so instead a typical computer or television uses lights like these: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/JHeGa.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/JHeGa.png</a> By contrast, a typical subtractive system uses primary dyes like these: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/qri1f.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/qri1f.png</a> (the colored lines on the charts are the reflectances at various concentrations)<p>You <i>cannot</i> reproduce any color the human visual system can perceive through just three primary lights: every display system has a “gamut”, and for example computer displays have great difficulty displaying saturated blue-green colors.<p>As Hunt summarizes,<p><i>“It will be realized that these three expedients cannot correct for the fundamental limitations of the process, which spring from the nature of the colour mechanism of the eye and the shape of the spectral absorption curves of the best available cyan, magenta, and yellow dyes. What is claimed for modern subtractive processes is that they produce pleasing colour pictures, and that the inevitable inaccuracies are balanced in such a way as to be least noticeable.”</i><p>> <i>The ""four color"" wheel he lists at the end is not wrong, it's just silly: you could pick any points on the wheel and their opposites and have the same thing.</i><p>This is not true. Color opponency and the specialness of the so-called “unique hues” have had a great deal of scientific literature about them (physiology, psychophysics, linguistics, etc.), and no, you could not just pick any four arbitrary points. Of course, there’s some learned/cultural component to people’s color categorization too, and there are individual physiological differences, so there’s inter-observer disagreement on precisely what color is “unique red”, etc. But it is indeed true that any color can be described as some combination of red, yellow, blue, green, white, and black: this is Hering’s theory of color vision, the inspiration for the Swedish NCS system, based on decades of rigorous measurements in the 40s–70s.<p>The current scientific consensus is that color vision can be modeled in a simple way with 2 stages: (1) trichromacy of 3 cone responses, (2) higher-level opponent mechanism. There are many more complicated effects beyond that, and it’s essential to consider adaptation, but those 2 cover the basics.<p>* * *<p>All of that said, I’m not completely satisfied with the original essay either. It’s pretty fluffy and hand-wavey, and the jokey language gets in the way. Conflating long/medium/short cones with red/green/blue colors is dangerous because it hides what’s really going on. I wouldn’t, as the author of this article does, call the red–yellow–blue–green anchored hue circle “proper”; there are other equally valid organizations, such as the Munsell system’s, which aims for perceptually uniform hue spacing.
Still, on the whole it’s on the right track.<p>* * *<p>I’m sorry that the Wikipedia articles about these topics aren’t clearer and more comprehensive, or I’d point you there. As the article says, the best resource online is Bruce MacEvoy’s handprint.com, but several books have excellent explanations. If you’re interested and MacEvoy’s site doesn’t clear things up I can suggest where to look in the library.",1296596397

Agreed, and I see that as a developing problem.  It didn't seem to happen as often two years ago, or even one year ago, but it seems to be happening a lot now.  A consequence is that a significant proportion of submissions are duplicated stories.  It would be nice to ensure that stories people obviously like (because they are submitted repeatedly) actually got noticed the first time around.<p>There are simply too many submissions for people to see them all, and so many good submissions are simply lost in the noise.  If they get noticed then they get upvoted and hit the front page, but many sink without trace.  The resubmissions are indirect evidence that we are missing potentially valuable stories.<p>It would be nice to fix that.",1296594576

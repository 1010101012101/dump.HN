Market saturation also plays a role, plus the theoretical and practical limits to quality in both of those cases. Costs do not scale linearly with quality increases. There is a limit to the quality differences people can differentiate, so at some point people will stop paying for better bread and pianos because a) they better versions are too expensive, and/or b) they can't tell the difference between that and what they already have.<p>How many people do you know who wish they had a piano but they can't find one that's of high enough quality?",1256662790

905757,comment,905392,905392,0,0,bokonist,,,"Despite the surface appearance that the gender divide in the workforce has narrowed, it's actually amazing how deep it really is.  Men still dominate the ""making things"" segment of the workforce - manufacturing, engineering, construction, agriculture, transportation.  Women are still concentrated in education, healthcare, human resources, administrative, and non-profits.  Part of the reason for women doing so well in the work force is the continued growth of government and psuedo-government bureaucracy that generates more education/healthcare/administrative jobs.<p>In the 19th century, the model for wealthy families was that the man would be the bread winner, and the woman would live off the man's support and would work in charity or the arts or reform movements.  Now the pattern of work is the exact same at the 19th century.  The difference is rather than marrying a man for the income, women vote to tax the income away, and then women get jobs in non-profits or government agencies.  Then, to add insult to injury, you get articles like this claiming that men need to get with the program.  Would society benefit if the machinist or truck driver who drops out of high school, instead continues his education and becomes a civil service paper pusher?  I don't think so, in fact, it is the reverse.<p>(Note, these two paragraphs are observing very general, aggregate trends, obviously there are a gazillion exceptions on the individual level)",1256662509
905756,comment,905198,905382,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I'm not an expert in these things, and appreciate the opportunity to learn more.<p>It seems to me that a transactional database necessarily requires all sorts of locking and waits to ensure that everyone using the database sees the same, bang-up-to-date version of the data.  This is probably essential in some applications.<p>The point of CouchDB seems to be that sometimes the system doesn't need the most up-to-date version of the data, and that data that's not-very-old will do, especially if it was valid at the start of the process.  CouchDB then has a different set of invariants, a different collection of guarantees.<p>CouchDB seems to work on the idea that changes will propogate, and that the system will settle, and that processes will never get inconsistent data, although the data might sometimes be old/stale.  These guarantees might then suffice, especially in places where locking and the delays/bottlenecks threatened by locaking would be unacceptable.<p>Is that a reasonable summary?",1256662393

If you replace log cabin with Natural Building [1] and expensive air conditioning and heating with smart design [2], you can build a cheap, sustainable home for very cheap.  A group of us is working on building a development of this style only a short bike ride away from Bloomington, IN - close enough to easily/cheaply get into town and alleviate boredom - all to the tune of less than $100/mo over 15-30 yrs or $10-20k down.  btown cooperative living at gmail if you are interested.<p></plug><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_building"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_building</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_cooling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_cooling</a>",1256659211

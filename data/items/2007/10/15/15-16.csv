68065,comment,68000,68057,0,0,ratsbane,,,"That's not necessarily true.  If the compiler is smart enough it won't recalculate the value of a numeric expression which doesn't contain any variables.  On the other hand, dereferencing a variable isn't without cost. Of course, in most cases you'd be dereferencing variables anyway in the test clause, so the original idea, compute loop limits before entering the loop, is correct.:<p>\n  mbp:~/test doug$ time php -r 'for ($i=1; $i<100000000/10; $i++) {$x++;};'<p><pre><code>  real    0m5.930s\n  user    0m5.867s\n  sys     0m0.026s\n\n  mbp:~/test doug$ time php -r '$maxval=100000000/10; for ($i=1; $i<$maxval; $i++) {$x++;};'\n\n  real    0m6.999s\n  user    0m6.907s\n  sys     0m0.029s\n\n\n\n  mbp:~/test doug$ time perl -e 'for ($i=1; $i<100000000/10; $i++) {$x++;}'\n\n  real    0m2.520s\n  user    0m2.496s\n  sys     0m0.010s\n\n  mbp:~/test doug$ time perl -e '$maxval=100000000/10; for ($i=1; $i<$maxval; $i++) {$x++;}'\n\n  real    0m2.537s\n  user    0m2.499s\n  sys     0m0.014s\n\n\n</code></pre>\nThe results are a little different with Python (maxval1.py computes inline; maxval2 divides in advance and uses variable inline)<p><pre><code>  mbp:~/test doug$ time python maxval1.py\n\n  real    0m2.134s\n  user    0m1.761s\n  sys     0m0.276s\n\n  mbp:~/test doug$ time python maxval2.py\n\n  real    0m1.890s\n  user    0m1.588s\n  sys     0m0.278s\n\n</code></pre>\nJava shows even more of a difference (again, maxval2 sets variable in advance):<p><pre><code>  mbp:~/test doug$ time java maxval1\n\n  real    0m0.174s\n  user    0m0.116s\n  sys     0m0.040s\n\n  mbp:~/test doug$ time java maxval2\n\n  real    0m0.531s\n  user    0m0.125s\n  sys     0m0.041s\n</code></pre>",1192462656

68063,comment,68006,68006,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I usually use optimistic row level locking for typical structured data in a 3NF data model. If there is so much contention for a particular record that pessimistic or column level locking is necessary there might be a problem with the design of the data model or workflow. There are of course rare situations where pessimistic locking is justified. The canonical one is  multi hop flight reservations.<p>Handling semi structured data (documents of some sort) is way trickier and depends a great deal on the particular data format and patterns of use. Merging is desirable but very hard to achieve in many cases.<p>One other thing that is worth thinking about is how the locking strategy scales. The most popular idea these days is to seperate read and write operations so all writes go to one DBMS server and the reads are distributed to replicas. That's ugly to integrate after the fact, so if you expect your app to grow fast you should probably design it like that from the start.",1192461500

Questioning what you&#x27;re taught, or how you&#x27;re taught it, or even the methods you&#x27;ve been told to use while learning the material, is tantamount to academic &quot;death&quot;. So we see a lot of people just go along with it to avoid low marks or other forms of retribution they may face if they question the system. This can even cause physical and mental hardship for some people.<p>But I don&#x27;t see how it isn&#x27;t the participant&#x27;s fault if the participant can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t say, &quot;This could unreasonably harm me; I&#x27;m not doing it.&quot;, and then keeps participating to the point of harm taking place.<p>We&#x27;re talking about something that they&#x27;re voluntarily doing, after all. If these people lack the judgment to know what their boundaries are, and when they might be exceeding them, then I don&#x27;t see how anyone but the participants are responsible for any harm that may happen. Nobody but the participant, regardless of whether they&#x27;re participating in college or physical training, is responsible if the participant lacks the self control to stop engaging in a completely voluntary, yet harmful, behavior.",1400417875

The body prioritizes not losing any of its substance, so most &quot;healthy&quot; adults will always at least eat the amount they need to not lose weight. On top of that come fatal breakages in the messaging system the body uses to control the flow of energy. Fat people are prone to insulin resistance, physical extension of their digestive system that leads to the urge for more throughput, and other mechanisms - all of which cause an almost insurmountable desire to eat a lot.<p>It&#x27;s an addiction that subverts two of our most powerful mental priorities: the reward/pleasure system and the survival instinct. In most people there is not a lot that can be done to overcome what these two systems tell you. That&#x27;s why diets fail: my body is lying to me.

Actually, it&#x27;s not something new, there are many complaints about crossfit from knowledgeable people. Especially often I see powerlifters ranting about crossfit being harmful.<p>But here&#x27;s the problem. As you know HN isn&#x27;t sports resource, yet article about CF is on top. Why? …You see what I mean? It&#x27;s extremely popular amongst people that don&#x27;t want to be powerlifters or swimmers or sprinters, that don&#x27;t really care about competing at all, they just want to have some exercising program to follow and stay fit. Which is totally fair. For which crossfit is better than nothing (at least until you injure your ankle while doing box-jumps). And I completely understand those who doesn&#x27;t follow advices like &quot;don&#x27;t do crossfit, do powerlifting&quot; as powerlifting competitions cannot be the goal for them.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is when there is counter-advice there should be advice as well. Now, Erin isn&#x27;t a powerlifter and sure she provides something like &quot;fitness training plan&quot;, but while the idea of crossfit training is clear (maximizing intensity whatever exercises you do) neither she nor others provide enough material for self-education to be able to do some &quot;not-harmful crossfit&quot;. And people essentially want &quot;not-harmful crossfit&quot;, not training for judo or sprinting or powerlifting… unless they <i>do</i> judo or sprinting or powerlifting of course.<p>So, <i></i>tl;dr<i></i>: crossfit is harmful — nothing new here. &quot;Train like an athlete, but train safely.&quot; — not informative/constructive enough.",1400417150

I want to highlight two problems in the proposal:<p>> <i>They argue that surviving on less than 4,000 francs a month is not possible because rents, health insurance and food are all prohibitively expensive.</i><p>There are multiple problems with that. The first beeing that you <i>can</i> survive on less than 4000 francs a month. A few of my friends are doing it, and they live <i>directly</i> in the city of Zürich where flats and food is most expensive. They aren&#x27;t living like kings, but they can afford a small appartment and a car.\nSeriously, that number is just too high. Okay, as a decent (senior) dev you&#x27;ll get 8000 per month, in Zürich. But as a dev, you&#x27;ll have a pretty good live in Switzerland in general, nevertheless, you can live on 3000 a month directly in Zürich if you can live with a one room flat. If you&#x27;re on minimum wage you&#x27;ll probably want to accept a 20 minute train ride and live a bit outside the city and get a larger flat.<p>The second problem: If you&#x27;re <i>outside</i> of Zürich/Geneva/$expensiveCity, with 4k/month you can probably afford a 4-room flat and a decent car.<p>Seriously, the rent is the biggest issue here, you would have to set the minimim wage depending on where in Switzerland you live (i.e. minimum wage per canton, not for the whole country). If you&#x27;re on minimum wage you probably don&#x27;t have a huge selection of offers <i>where</i> you&#x27;re going to work, or the option to work remote, so you need work near your flat.

1206216,comment,1206037,1206037,0,0,hristov,,,"Here is a writing tip: if you talk about a hypothetical person of undefined sex, choose ""he"" or ""she"" and stick with it. Some writing teachers say one should always use ""she"" to avoid sexism, but that is obviously not followed. As long as you do not actively reinforce stereotypes (i.e., you call all hypothetical flight attendants ""she"" and all hypothetical lawyers ""he""), I think using ""he"" is fine.<p>But if you mix ""he"" or ""she"" up then you just raise questions in the reader's mind. Here the author has half ""he's"" and half ""she's"" which opens him (or her!) to bunch of accusations of sexism. Why was the newbie a ""she""?",1269075478
1206215,comment,1206045,1206045,0,0,jsz0,,,"Mozilla: Stick to your ideals but don't fall on your sword. The openness argument is worth making right now before HTML5 video takes off. It probably won't radically slow the adoption of HTML5 video, or change H264 being the preferred codec, but they might have a chance to make Theora and equal player. They just need to flip WebKit and Microsoft would probably follow. Not totally impossible. Worth the fight in my opinion. What Mozilla needs to be careful of is taking it too far and weakening their market share reducing diversity of browsers if HTML5 video really delivers a better experience than Flash video (and it probably will) This would only serve to strengthen Apple, Google and Microsoft's role in controlling the browser. Mozilla needs to know when they're beat and live to fight another day. I give it another 12-18 months or whenever IE9 hits Windows Update.",1269075442

So I'll clarify.<p>Earlier, when I was learning to play guitar, I really really wanted to become a good guitar player. So, I spent countless hours to practice, but I wasn't advancing that much. And all the time I knew what the problem was, although I didn't admit it to myself.<p>It did not come from the heart.<p>I thought that it is only a matter of decision, and a matter of how much time and effort I put into it. But at the end it is a matter of motivation, and as you all know, motivation is not something you just pick and choose; it is something you look for, but you cannot force it. My motivation for playing guitar was shallow, but I tried not to face it, because becoming a good guitarist would have been so cool.<p>Eventually I started to hate it, gave up and got rid of the whole instrument.<p>Only years later I got a new ""bite"" to the hobby, and this time I was wise enough to admit that I am not willing to practice hard to become a good player - and never have been.<p>Instead, I just warmed up the old stuff, and started inventing my own music. Composing. Just trying out things, seeking for something that sounds good and then developing on that. Nothing too complicated or special. And boy, have I enjoyed playing guitar since then! I don't push a schedule, I don't push any targets, I just play exactly how I feel like and when I like. And time to time I feel like learning something new, borrow a couple of music books and have a sprint of actually practicing on something. But only as far as I find enjoyment in learning itself.<p>So, that is what I mean that I would have all the time I wanted, but I just don't (want). Anything more than I currently happen to put on it, would be waste of my time because I wouldn't enjoy it.",1269074406

For example, the typical poor household in Udaipur could spend up to 30 percent more on food if it did not spend money on alcohol, tobacco, and festivals.<p>Consuming alcohol and tobacco not only takes money away from a family’s nutrition, but also sets off a cascade of other problems that poor people more frequently encounter. Alcohol abuse, for instance, reduces work performance while increasing accidents, domestic violence, and illness. Because many indigent people earn their livelihoods through physical labor, falling ill means not earning money.</i><p>A small problem with their theory:  Every last item they list has medicinal purposes.  It's possible (and in my opinion very likely) that alcohol, tobacco, spices and tea are being used by ""the poor"" to self-medicate.  For example, alcohol kills germs and poor people often live in filth.  How do we know that their situation wouldn't be worse without it?  If you want them to stop drinking, you would need to resolve the underlying reasons motivating them to drink -- which may well be rooted in ""poverty"" but it isn't necessarily rooted in lack of money per se.<p>Financial problems grow out of real problems.  Resolve the underlying real problems and the financial problems tend to clear up on their own, or at least improve.

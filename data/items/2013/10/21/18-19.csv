6587460,comment,6585828,6587391,6,0,pcwalton,,,"Regarding point (1), it starts to matter when autovectorization kicks in. If this expression is in a loop and the compiler can autovectorize (which rustc does, if you have a new enough version), you really want to be able to pack more values into a SIMD register if you can. (This is one point in which this paper is out of date…)<p>As for point (2), well, I think that making the size of &quot;tmp&quot; f64 would interact badly with other features like operator overloading and generics, since you&#x27;re playing fast and loose with types.<p>Gory details (warning, type theory ahead): &quot;+&quot; is implemented by a trait, Add(RHS,Result) where RHS and Result are concrete types and there is a functional dependency so that Self + RHS → Result. This fundep is necessary because otherwise &quot;let tmp: b + c&quot; wouldn&#x27;t work, as the compiler doesn&#x27;t know what the type of &quot;tmp&quot; is (is it f32 or f64? It won&#x27;t guess.) So you can&#x27;t simultaneously implement f32 : Add(f32,f32) and f32 : Add(f32,f64). We&#x27;d have to introduce a <i>lot</i> more experimental type machinery to make this work (a &quot;floating point functional dependency&quot;, I guess?) and I&#x27;m not sure there wouldn&#x27;t be fallout (for example, I can foresee issues with higher-kinded type parameters).",1382381542

The justification for it is as such:<p>> The Federal Minister of Justice Hugh Guthrie made the false statement in the House of Commons on July 2 that &quot;shots were fired by the strikers and the fire was replied to with shots from the city police.&quot; During the long trials that followed, no evidence was ever produced to show that strikers fired shots during the riot. For his part, Bennett characterized the On-to-Ottawa Trek as &quot;not a mere uprising against law and order but a definite revolutionary effort on the part of a group of men to usurp authority and destroy government.&quot;<p>Granted, this was in 1935 and the Red Scare hadn&#x27;t yet been in full-swing, however the Communist Party of Canada was involved.<p>The political fall-out is particularly notable:<p>> The events helped to discredit Bennett&#x27;s Conservative government, and in the 1935 federal election, his party went from holding 134 seats to just 69. It also increased the notoriety of the Communist Party of Canada, which was behind the organization of the Trek. After the Trek, the government provided free transportation as a peace sign back to the west. The camp was soon dismantled and replaced by seasonal relief camps run by the provinces and that paid the men slightly more for their labour than the earlier camps.

It&#x27;s control, I already emphasized that above. They spend a lot on other things, it&#x27;s not like they direly lack resources.<p>2) I didn&#x27;t invent the usage of &quot;open&quot; as in &quot;liberated&quot;. That&#x27;s used in open Web, open technologies and etc. Usually some try to complain that free software is different from open source software and so on. While it&#x27;s formally valid, most often you can deduce what&#x27;s implied from the context. Open codecs imply liberated codecs. Open standard (in many contexts) includes being not encumbered by patents (surely, even closed codec can be implemented as open source, it doesn&#x27;t make it free because of that). And that&#x27;s not the case with proprietary codecs - they are patent encumbered. That&#x27;s why they are not open standards. When something is discussed as open vs closed as in not having a public specification, it&#x27;s usually pretty clear.<p>3) Vorbis is clearly innovative over MP3. We were talking about digital players, and most of them use MP3, not AAC.<p>Opus is clearly innovative over any above, including AAC.<p>4) I already explained, it&#x27;s not about expenses. It&#x27;s about control. It&#x27;s not just about &quot;taking actions that benefit other people&quot;. It&#x27;s about taking the opposite - actions which damage others (i.e. HTML5 codecs mess). Apple can&#x27;t escape being blamed for it.<p>5) Even if there is some benefit in limiting the number of codecs, it&#x27;s not what drives Apple not to use open ones, especially when they are technically better.<p>So we agree that Apple doesn&#x27;t see a benefit in using open codecs, but we disagree on their motivation or what exactly they see as a benefit. You view them equating benefit with reducing expenses. I think they consider control as the primary benefit.",1382380533

Yes, when it comes to Python I am a noob.<p>Looking at it with fresh eyes it seems that the most useful ecosystem is solidly rooted in the 2.7.x branch.  Books and online courses promote the idea of using 2.7.x.  My kid enrolled in the MIT intro to CS edX course and they use 2.7.5.  Codecademy, same thing.<p>From the perspective of developing a number of non-trivial web-based products, how should I view the 2.7.x and 3.x ecosystems?  Do you see a timeline to a transition?  How should one prepare for it (or not)?  What should one avoid?<p>At the moment it seems safe to pretty much ignore 3.x.  I kind of hate that because I have this intense desire to always work with the the latest stable release of any software I use.  Here things are different due to the surrounding ecosystem of libraries and tools.  I&#x27;d certainly appreciate any and all help in understanding this a bit better.",1382380013

Even here, though, in the typical cases of installers and updaters, there are easy workarounds that at least don&#x27;t require logging out or giving additional rights to the logged-in user: fast user switch or login(1) to an admin user, then retry from there.<p>The only thing Windows does differently here is that it provides a silent, non-admin workaround (filesystem and registry virtualization) for buggy applications, which works, but which can be problematic in other ways. Most notably, while OS-level workarounds are a clear win for older and otherwise unsupported software, they reduce motivation for developers to fix bugs in <i>current</i> software papered over by Windows&#x27; workarounds.",1382379994

You seem to believe it is negligible in cost while I believe it is quite achievable if they wanted to do it but VERY far from free to support additional codecs.<p>2) Terminology.  I don&#x27;t like appropriation of words and think that terminology does matter. I was clear in an early post that I understood that the AAC/AVC/MPEG4 codecs are not free (or Free). I will continue to argue against claims (even implicit) that Open Standards are not open.<p>3) Innovation. Although I haven&#x27;t responded to the point I don&#x27;t see Vorbis as a significant innovation beyond AAC so I don&#x27;t see Apple as holding back innovation by not supporting it. I don&#x27;t see much innovation held back by the lack of Free codecs but perhaps you do.<p>4) &quot;it benefits them to sabotage the industry and to hold back innovation&quot; This is a really strange one to me. As (3) I&#x27;m not sure about the innovation.  Also the idea that they have a duty to at their own expense (1) take actions that benefit other people seems odd to me. If they were using their own proprietary codec that would be different but I just don&#x27;t see the <i>duty</i> that they are breaching.<p>5) My view is that there are advantages to the limited set of codec required to support virtually all devices that may even outweigh the disadvantages of them not being Free. This is probably our core disagreement. Until there is at least a factor of two improvement in coding efficiency it is unlikely to be worth making a leap in codecs. Vorbis, theora, VP8 all came too late (at least with hardware implementations) to win this generation and it is best that an open non-proprietary winner takes all.  The presence of the Free codecs (and to an even greater degree VC-1 which at the time was pitched as royalty free) helped ensure reasonable licensing terms for AAC/AVC etc. (unlike MPEG4 part2/H.263) so for almost all use cases the cost of AAC/AVC/MPEG4 is negligible in business scenarios. (Shipping a free Linux distribution or other free player/encoder software is the only case that I can see being troubled but they mostly get around it by not including the codecs while making it easy for the user to obtain them elsewhere.)",1382379384

US consumers are probably <i>rightly</i> suprised.<p><i>Despite the expectations of economists that the euro change\nover would have no effect on prices, European consumers perceived the opposite. To shed some light on this puzzle, we develop a model of imperfect information in which cheaper goods experience higher price growth after the changeover.

The lower the price transparency after the changeover, the higher the euro–related inflation.

6587176,comment,6581987,6584878,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"First, let me repeat that I am not claiming that taxation drives no behavior. I&#x27;m saying that the degree to which it drives behavior is frequently overstated.<p>><i>You&#x27;re basically questioning the efficient market hypothesis...</i><p>No, I&#x27;m not. Your example is specious. If you posit an overly-simplistic scenario that allows Company X to easily save $5M, then of course they will do it. Anyone would agree that&#x27;s just rational behavior. What I am saying, however, is that many (including you) opine that individuals/corporations will suddenly begin to engage in completely irrational or counter-productive behavior because, you know, taxes.<p>><i>There is mathematically no non-tax difference between issuing a dividend and using the same money to have a share buy-back...</i><p>Except that the net income that flows to me is greater as a shareholder. If corporations want to maximize shareholder value (and hence drive demand/stock price up), then paying dividends is certainly one means of doing that. If I can effectively earn that dividend while continuing to hold the underlying stock as it continues to appreciate in value, then when I finally cash out, I will have earned more while also enjoying the use of the money (dividends) along the way. <i>This is irrespective of tax consequences</i>. Many &quot;rationally-acting&quot; shareholders recognize the appeal of dividends. Perhaps this is why, for instance, dividends have contributed to at least 45% of the total return of stocks in the S&P 500 since 1926.<p>><i>That doesn&#x27;t make any sense. If a shareholder wants cash then they can sell that portion of their shares and the tax event would be smaller than receiving a dividend...</i><p>Sure, it makes sense. For one, with dividends the shareholder still retains the underlying asset vs. by selling portions of his stock. This discussion is off-track though. You&#x27;re correct that the tax treatment is the same but my initial point with dividends was to simply refute your assertion that companies might suddenly stop paying &quot;dividends at all&quot; because, taxes.  Instead, I provided an example of rational, &quot;healthy&quot; behavior that might result from tax changes. This vs. the typical knee-jerk overstated response that &quot;any taxes are evil and will cause otherwise rational people to suddenly and completely lose their minds&quot;.<p>><i>Then explain the multi-billion dollar cash hoards held by most large successful corporations</i><p>I don&#x27;t get your point here in the context of this discussion. Companies frequently accrue cash when profitable and they haven&#x27;t allocated it for re-investment, acquisitions, etc. Depending on the company and degree, this may or may not be desirable, as it may well-represent an under-utilization of resources. But, your initial implication was that companies will hold on to cash simply to avoid taxation, as if they&#x27;d do so even in light of investment or other opportunities.<p>This is the kind of thinking to which I am taking exception. It attributes to actors these completely irrational behaviors that are supposedly generated by the tax code.<p>><i>But they can make bad or less good investments than the real parties in interest</i><p>Sure, anything can happen. But, this is a huge leap on pure conjecture. The company is going to do what it thinks best, given the environment, period. There are a whole host of influencing factors. It&#x27;s an unrealistic overstatement to say that they will suddenly become irrational because, taxes.<p>><i>I&#x27;m not sure why that should make the investors want to pay it any more.</i><p>That&#x27;s a trite response. Obviously, people don&#x27;t enjoy paying taxes. The point is that the other end of the argument overstates the &quot;damage&quot; caused to the investor psyche by taxation. And, that overstatement is an important part of assigning this outsized behavioral effect to taxes overall.

If you are holding the stock for other reasons (company control, etc.), then that&#x27;s a different calculus. You&#x27;re probably not interested in cashing out irrespective of the tax scenario. I was following the thread you&#x27;d started, that essentially assumed that people who are ready to cash out won&#x27;t do so simply to avoid taxation.",1382378542

I mean, I have some numbers, I write an expression with them, and then I expect to get the most accurate possible result. Doesn&#x27;t it make a lot more sense to let users specifically specify that a given expression is to be evaluated only using 32-bit float values, than to make everybody always cast every value in every expression to 64-bit float?

However, please don&#x27;t be prematurely happy, &quot;because $600 less&quot; is not what will fix you -- the coverage itself will.<p>Let&#x27;s hope that when you need that coverage, you won&#x27;t be treated the same way as ObamaCare website right now is. You see, before you could complain to your health plan, make a big stink out of it, even sue them, because there were private entity. When to GOV takes over, all you can is pray. Go ahead make a big stink that their system is broken, but don&#x27;t be surprised to get heavily audited, for example.<p>My point is that I would prefer to pay even $6000 more knowing I will get the quality of coverage I pay for. I would not want to pay less to be hit with bureaucracy, abuse, lack of transparency and fairness the way government will serve me like they did with their website.",1382378481

6587161,comment,6585867,6586918,2,0,tunesmith,,,"The Medical Loss Ratio part of the law also helps with that.  Used to be that plans paid 75% - 80% of their premiums towards care.  Now they&#x27;re mandated to pay 85%, or 80% for individual plans.<p>The other thing to factor in is that most of the people that are experiencing premium increases are on plans that don&#x27;t meet the &quot;minimum level of care&quot; as mandated by ACA.  Those plans that no longer qualify are often the types of plans that lead to the horror stories of people being kicked off of plans after becoming sick (rescission), lifetime maximum amounts, etc.  Insurance companies were saving a lot of money due to those brutal practices.  Part of the intent of the ACA was to eradicate those practices, which ultimately protects the people that were subscribed to those plans, and who didn&#x27;t understand they were at that type of risk.<p>In other words, if you were subscribing to a crap plan, your premiums were artificially low in the first place.  It&#x27;s kind of a degraded case of the people that are complaining that they can&#x27;t any longer go insurance-free.  The law of the land now is that everyone has to participate, in order to help take care of our sick and injured - so that means that our insurance plans all have to have a basic level of quality.<p>I would bet that if you restricted your search to the people that originally had plans that met that basic level of quality (which is really not all that high), you would find that their premiums have gone down.<p>(Obligatory data point: I&#x27;m self-employed in washington, have had a Regence BCBS plan for $540, and my monthly premium will go down about $150-$200 / month for similar care.)",1382378436

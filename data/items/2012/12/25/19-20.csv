I've already described why this is unsafe (take any of these examples, replace the string with something like ""Everyone knows 4 < 5"", and it breaks the document due to the inclusion of ""special"" characters).<p>Now you feel that the correct use of this function is <i>so</i> obvious that it merits mocking my belief that it may be misunderstood by users (despite the comments on that very documentation page describing how they use it as a simple text to html converter). So given that it is so obvious to you, I repeat my original request: just give me an example where nl2br isn't ultimately used to transform plaintext before outputting it to HTML.",1356465584

4966922,comment,4966910,4966910,1,0,DanBC,,,"> The value of t was chosen to take into consideration the growth in computational power due to ""Moore's Law"".  Based on the SEMATECH National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (1997 edition), we can expect internal chip speeds to increase by a factor of approximately 13 overall up to 2012, when the clock rates reach about 10GHz.  After that improvements seem more difficult, but we estimate that another factor of five might be achievable by 2034.  Thus, the overall rate of computation should go through approximately six doublings by 2034.<p>Not many people are running 10 GHz computers; GPUs and parallel processing have taken a lot of work off the CPU.  But that doesn't help with problems that are 'intrinsically sequential' - is anyone working on that?<p>I'm aware of some semi-obscure projects for parallelisation (Copocobana, etc etc) but I'm keen to learn more about fast non-parallel computing.",1356465304

I think it's also a meaningful innovation, but each to his/her own.<p>Second, pretty much everyone would agree that the early Android versions were not really innovative and pretty much a copy of iOS (which is certainly not the case anymore). Also, history is littered with inferior systems with little innovation that eventually won. So, it doesn't seem to be the case that the consumer necessarily chooses for 'meaningful innovations'. There's also price, branding, luck, etc.<p>Third, it is very strange to compare RIM and Windows Phone. RIM is more like Apple: one operating system, one device vendor. Windows Phone is more like, erm... Windows ;) or perhaps even Android: one operating system, competing device vendors. The dynamics are completely different, e.g. a phone vendor might choose to push WP or Android more, depending on what is offered in terms of differentiation, royalties, patent licensing costs, etc. Also, like the grandparent says, Microsoft as quite a popular ecosystem to leverage WP (Windows, XBox 360, Office, etc.).",1356465144

4966894,comment,4966404,4966672,2,0,bonzoesc,,,"> In some places, the high octane gasoline does not have ethanol in it but some cars do not run as well on high octane gas because the gasoline does not ignite at the most efficient time for the engine.<p>I don't believe this is the case. Gasoline engines with higher compression need the higher octane fuel because it won't ignite at the temperature and pressure in the cylinder prior to the spark plug firing. Once the plug fires, the temperature and pressure are right for gasoline of any octane level within reason to combust.<p>There's no downside to running high-octane racing gasoline through a low-compression engine like the Atkinson-cycle engine in the Prius, but no benefit either. Other engines, like the 5.0 V8 in the Mustang GT, have different performance ratings for different grades of fuel. Still other engines, like the 2.0T I4 in the Volkswagen GTI, require high octane fuels for the extra compression they run.",1356464681

Military launch costs have been rather high but the bigger issue has been the cost and management of military satellites. The procurement of next generation spy satellites has been nothing short of a debacle, as they've gone hugely over budget and behind schedule and there are some indications that they've missed the mark in terms of capabilities and reliability as well. All of this is, of course, shrouded in secrecy so there's much we don't know but there's enough publicly available data to be able to divine that the whole thing has been a GDCF for at least the last decade.<p>This in turn puts more pressure on the launch providers as any failures, delays, or cost increases there just adds salt to the wound. Which partially explains the enthusiasm the DoD is showing for putting military hardware on SpaceX rockets. Also, the ability to take advantage of the Falcon Heavy's increased payload may give some breathing room to the spacecraft manufacturers, since there are few problems in spacecraft design which can't be made easier by merely adding more mass. And the ability to launch cheaper and potentially more often could enable a more iterative style of satellite development, and also a more competitive one (launching full-up prototype satellites prior to awarding a multi-satellite contract, for example).

They forward it for the hotel to charge you for the entirety of your booking.<p>Companies like Expedia follow the merchant model, they buy up hotels rooms in bulk in advance and then re-sell them directly to customers. When you buy from a merchant your credit card isn't shared with the hotel as there's no need to do so.<p>Other companies like Booking.com and Agoda follow the agency model. They find customers for the hotels, forward their payment details along to the hotel, the hotel charges the customer, and then pays the agency a percentage of the booking as an agency fee[1].<p>Both models have their pros and cons. The merchant model works brilliantly in the US where large chains are the norm. It works less well in Europe where the vast number of hotels are small properties.<p><pre><code>    > Imagine the surprise when you are at the hotel counter\n    > and the staff shows you a printout of your credit card\n    > info(nothing obscured; everything in plain text).\n</code></pre>\nIt's fair enough that this makes you uncomfortable. But the hotel with that printout has a contract with the credit card company like any other merchant and is responsible for treating it responsibly.<p>I think you'd also be very surprised at the number of other merchants you might deal with where this is the case. Having a printout with a credit card number is not at all unusual in a lot of businesses.",1356464202

You enter as a child and are filled with facts and formula until you are a productive member of society. Boy was I wrong. School is about forming relationships, exploring your interests, and developing an identity. I did well in k-12 without applying myself and being the class clown, so I never took the whole institution too seriously. However, after dropping out of college to start a company, which didn't go as I thought it would, I realized a few more semesters would not have killed me. I really just wanted to say to the world 'I made it without that piece of paper, defied the odds, and did what I set out to do.'

But with a new format war coming up soon, and with other codecs like Daala and VP9 being ready to compete (hopefully) from day one, h.265 might not be the default option as h.264 was.<p>Also I think all new chips that came out this year had hardware acceleration support for VP8, and most media players support it now, too, as well as WebRTC. So even if h.265 wins again, hardware manufacturers may also support at least one of these open source codecs in the future, alongside h.265.",1356463425

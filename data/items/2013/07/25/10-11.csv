That&#x27;s not to say I disagree there are better ways of doing things per se, and that given another 5,000 years many of these issues will have been resolved but I think it&#x27;s a mistake to look at a system that&#x27;s basically working and focus on all the bits that don&#x27;t work because all the bits that do work have become so commonplace that you take them for granted.",1374749626

6101780,comment,6093785,6100385,1,0,vidarh,,,"How exactly? Pretty much all  of the functionality in MacPaint is in SuperPaint, which predated it by 6 years (I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re not confusing them, but this is the <i>Xerox</i> SuperPaint, not the later Mac application of the same name).<p>There are some superficial UI similarities between MacPaint and DPaint in how they both switched from a big separate panel of tools to toolbars along the side, but that&#x27;s pretty much the only similarities I can see between the two that were not already present in SuperPaint, and it&#x27;s line with a general trend, and even there it&#x27;s not all that obvious where DPaint draws most of its inspiration.<p>They differed substantially in that DPaint is geared towards making the entire screen available as a canvas, and most people I know who used DPaint spent most of the time with the UI hidden, only turning it on briefly to pick colours etc., or when using the split screen zoom (to date I hate the way most paint apps do zoom with a vengeance - DPaint had it right).<p>In many ways the UI of SuperPaint is closer to the UI of DPaint than MacPaint is. The windowed interface with multiple toolbars of MacPaint was totally foreign to Amiga paint apps that for years followed the Deluxe Paint model of putting tools firmly at the screen edges and making them easy to hide.<p>I don&#x27;t see much influence from MacPaint that matters frankly, though I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re right there was <i>some</i> - MacPaint did after all make it out the door sooner and it&#x27;d be silly of them not to look at what was well received. But in the overall design, the influence from SuperPaint is plain - all the functionality shared between MacPaint and DPaint was there in Xerox&#x27; SuperPaint years before.<p>Other than their shared heritage with SuperPaint and superficial UI stuff, to me the two are fundamentally different - the &quot;some innovations&quot; is what makes DPaint interesting at all: MacPaint is not usable as a paint application; DPaint is. By the time DPaint came out, the market was flooded with MacPaint clones. But pretty much all of them lacked the paint tools that made DPaint exciting.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where Studio/x comes in - they post-date DPaint by several years as far as I can tell (wow - that&#x27;s a hard product line to Google; I&#x27;d never heard of them before); the field was extremely crowded by then.",1374749423

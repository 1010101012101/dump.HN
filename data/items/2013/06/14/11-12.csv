In gaming, you&#x27;d hear this phrase when a team is dominating the other team to the point where they are forcing whatever mechanic against the will of the other team.<p>rape (rp)\nn. The crime of forcing another person to submit to sex acts, especially sexual intercourse.\nn. The act of seizing and carrying off by force; abduction.\nn. Abusive or improper treatment; violation: a rape of justice.<p>There are plenty of gamer scenarios that fall into n. #2 and 3.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s an extreme example to use, but gamers are full of those. Isn&#x27;t this even more neutral than any typical partisan newscaster comparing new legislature or economical movement as rape? &quot;They are raping the economy..&quot; , &quot;They are raping the constitution.&quot;. In those examples, the anchor is literally comparing an action to rape, whereas in the phrase &quot;Just let it happen, it&#x27;ll be over soon&quot; is rather ambiguous, and if not aware of the origin you could contribute it to murder or bleeding out, as well.<p>Next on the list : &quot;Teabagging is not funny guys, it&#x27;s a real life rape tactic&quot; or other such malarky.",1371209753

Thus-far they have proven incapable of taking a stand on anything of significance. Sadly polling probably indicates that this isn&#x27;t something the public care enough about to make it worth them bringing down the government over, so I can easily see them rolling over in exchange for a few more years sucking on the teat of power. Or perhaps the most cowardly thing of all: making it a free-vote so that enough Lib Dem MPs will vote for it while Lib Dem HQ can claim to oppose it without any risk to the coalition.<p>It may be decided by UKIP and backbench Tories.

I don&#x27;t see anything about hunting in the 2nd amendment.

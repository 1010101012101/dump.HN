9454399,comment,9453041,9454323,0,0,mikeash,,,"Really old cars have very simple electronics. Even after computers started showing up in cars, they were pretty simple and didn&#x27;t interact much with the security aspect of things. When you start a car like this, you&#x27;re just making a connection between two wires to power up the electronics, and briefly making a connection between another two wires to run the starter motor. The only security in the whole system is provided by the fact that the connection is made by a switch that requires a key to turn it. If you don&#x27;t have the right key, you can&#x27;t turn the switch, and that means you can&#x27;t connect the wires.<p>The trouble is that the wires must be fairly exposed to the occupants of the car, since the switch has to be accessible. That means you can just bypass the switch entirely by removing the appropriate covers and attacking the wires directly. This is &quot;hotwiring.&quot;<p>Physical locks are also not all that difficult to defeat directly. You can pick an ignition switch much like you might pick any other lock.<p>Starting around the late 90s or so, car manufacturers started adding more robust security measures. These include things simple like locking the steering column when the ignition switch is off (thus preventing you from driving the car after hotwiring it), all the way up to authenticating the key with a relatively sophisticated protocol, and having the engine computer refuse to run the car unless it can sense a real key.<p>As a result of these changes, the list of most stolen car models is <i>still</i> topped by cars manufactured in the late 90s. Low-end Hondas from around 1998 are right at the top of the list, because they occupy a sweet spot of being relatively valuable and still fairly easy to steal. Modern cars are stolen literally orders of magnitude less frequently; about 100,000 older Hondas stolen per year in the US, whereas new cars are stolen at a rate of hundreds per model per year at worst. Also as a natural result of these changes, car theft is <i>way</i> down in the US. About 700,000 cars were stolen in the US in 2013, compared to almost 1.7 million in 1991. Pretty much the only way to steal a newer car is to either tow it away or steal the owner&#x27;s keys. (A common scenario for car thefts is a burglary turned into auto theft when the burglars find car keys in the house.)",1430247005

9454396,comment,9453041,9454323,0,0,majormajor,,,"Here&#x27;s a few I remember off the top of my head.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get into many older cars. Slim jim past the window is the classic example (and I opened my 80s Toyota with a coathanger multiple times when I locked myself out), but many times the locks could be opened by keys to other cards from the same manufacturer as well, they just didn&#x27;t seem to be that precise. And of course, smash the window as a last resort, that wouldn&#x27;t set off an alarm in the past. Nowdays cars have recessed lock things in the door panels (or button-controlled-locks that can&#x27;t be as easily manipulated with a coathanger, or even that don&#x27;t work at all if the car was locked from outside) to help prevent this, and the interior of the doors has more protection built around the lock mechanism so you can&#x27;t easily fish through there and hook onto the right lever.<p>Once inside an old car, starting it is usually just a matter of shorting the right pair of wires. Or using brute strength to turn the ignition cylinder even if they key isn&#x27;t an exact match (or maybe with a screwdriver, as another poster mentioned doing in the past in this thread). Modern cars have chips in the keys so that it&#x27;s not just a matter of closing a circuit, the key has to be coded to the car.<p>Or just tow the car somewhere and work on picking the lock later at your leisure. Overkill for a common car, but for something really nice it could be practical. Nowdays your more expensive cars have tilt and motion sensors that&#x27;ll set off the alarm if you locked it, left it, and someone else comes up and tries to tow it. Possibly GPS tracking or similar as well, IIRC, on some fancy stuff.<p>The fob-in-pocket entry/pushbutton start stuff gives up some of those improvements given an exploit like this, but overall I&#x27;d say is still much more secure. You need specialized hardware (that&#x27;s only useful for breaking into someone else&#x27;s car) and it wouldn&#x27;t work to, say, steal cars from an airport parking lot or somewhere else where they were left and the owner wasn&#x27;t in range. Keeping your car in a garage at home seems to mitigate a lot of the easiest vectors for this attack.",1430246986

You put more effort in and you get much more out, but there&#x27;s a lot of code for which that&#x27;s not the right tradeoff, just as there&#x27;s a lot of code for which it is.<p>I don&#x27;t consider the two to be in competition (aside from &quot;which hip new language should I learn today&quot;) either, though it&#x27;s less due to the easy-to-pick-up thing and the Rust mentality that:<p>- If it can be a footgun, be explicit (unsafe, exhaustive matching, unwrap)<p>- If you can do it at compile time, DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT (all the compiletime type safety, ownership, etc). All abstractions should be zero-cost or with minimal cost (at runtime). Try to write your code so that tests won&#x27;t be necessary (because a successful compile should <i>be</i> a test), and then write tests anyway!<p>(This mentality is pretty prevalent in both the Rust stdlib/language and external libraries. The equivalent of interface types in Rust (`Box<Trait>`) is generally frowned upon and only brought out when absolutely necessary, for example)<p>Go doesn&#x27;t really embrace either of these principles, so it doesn&#x27;t compete that way. You&#x27;re right, developers already are used to making those choices.<p>> worrying about Go vs. Rust is going to be a much narrower band of validity before you&#x27;re just prematurely optimizing. Rather a lot of high performance code still has &quot;vtables&quot; in it, used quite extensively.<p>Not necessarily. As mentioned before, the Rust way of doing things generally leads to a <i>lot</i> of optimized stuff. Taking the vtable example -- Go code that I&#x27;ve seen uses vtabley things <i>everywhere</i> (the stdlib is peppered with interface types). Using vtables isn&#x27;t bad, but when you use it for stuff that could have been solved by static dispatch (for large codebases -- that can be <i>everywhere</i>), then it can become an issue. In Rust a vtable is a last-resort that people will grumble about before picking up and using (but will use it whenever absolutely needed). Sure, a single vtable isn&#x27;t much of a performance optimization, but when all your APIs use static dispatch due to this mentality, the collective optimization is huuuge.<p>> In practice, I don&#x27;t expect many people to decide between Go and Rust based on performance needs on similar code... non-zero, yes, but not many.<p>For many applications, I agree. Systems programming is one where this doesn&#x27;t apply, but for stuff like a distributed consensus algorithm implementation (which I was doing), both Go and Rust are perfect. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that if I&#x27;d had more practice in Go, I would have been confused which language to write it in. (Right now I love Rust and am not great at Go so of course I would use Rust if given a choice)<p>For stuff like a browser, it&#x27;s not so much that there are batshit insane sharing patterns, it&#x27;s more because a browser is huge and performance matters a LOT. (I think pcwalton above explains why better than I can)",1430246922

The remaining question is how much memory you are willing to spend per amplitude but with two doubles it will take 2.6 * 10^92 bits. You only get away with 300 amplitudes if the spins are not entangled and the state of the system therefore is a product state, i.e. you can factor the state of the system into 300 independent states, one per spin.<p>A two spin system for example has the general state<p><pre><code>  a |DD> + b |DU> + c |UD> + d |UU>

requiring four complex amplitudes, not two bits only selecting one of the basis states.<p>EDIT: Could not resist. The storage density of a 15 mm thick 2 TB 2.5&quot; hard disk is 152.7 Ebit/m³.

Drop me a line if you really want to know more about the production side. I&#x27;m thinking of writing up an e-book or something, partly in anticipation of the SEC opening up proper investment-style crowdfunding and partly to put together cash money for a film I want to do.<p>On smaller films, yes and no. What you&#x27;ll see is more of a bimodal distribution - the big megastar films like the Avengers or anything with an A-list cast (eg 2 big stars and a few small ones) are not going away - those people know what they are doing in terms of story, production, marketing and so on and the people that work on them are the cream of the industry. Even when the results feel forced (eg some of the Star Wars prequels) they still make their money back many many times over.<p>And there will still be lots of small budget films, partly because it&#x27;s more accessible due to technology, partly because people need some way to get onto the industry ladder, and partly because it&#x27;s addictive. But times are tough budgetarily; to quote on industry exec overheard at the last Sundance, &#x27;what used to be a $10m film is now $5m, what used to be $5m is now $3m, $1m is the new $3m....&#x27;).<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that costs don&#x27;t scale linearly, but they go up in fits and starts, depending on which guilds and unions the production company has signed contracts with. So if I&#x27;m doing my first feature film, I can pay some writer a few thousand for a screenplay, or better, write it myself. But if I want a budget above a certain size I&#x27;d be better off with a Writer&#x27;s Guild of America member (not least to tempt investors, who don&#x27;t actually know from reading a script and a budget whether a film is going to be any good), and the minimum price for a WGA to turn in a feature script is $92,000. That&#x27;s even if you write it yourself, eg Quentin Tarantino gets paid to write the script, direct the film, and produce the movie (as he should, because each of those is a full-time job in its own way). So when you make films in the tens or hundreds of thousands budget range, it&#x27;s OK to ask people to work for free or pay minimum wage and buy worker&#x27;s comp insurance, but once your budget is over a million your crew costs jump substantially because now the unions want a piece. And while I&#x27;m not that big a fan of unions it&#x27;s mainly because they bring a lot of extra administrative bullshit and some obstructive work rules. The jump in expenses because of extra pay is just what people deserve, because of the inherently unsteady nature of the work, the very long hours and elevated physical risks, and the fact that virtually everyone in the industry does a huge amount of work for free or stupid cheap.<p>The basic problem from internet distribution, legal and illegal, is not so much the actual downloads in many cases as the fact that it makes revenue very unpredictable for producers and investors, and so the lower end of the market faces constant economic pressure because investors are understandably wary. I expect this to stabilize a bit as Netflix, Amazon, and others start doing more global buys, and equity crowdfunding is finally allowed to take place. But the practical reality for people in the industry has been that internet distribution and the culture of working for free that goes with it have broken a lot of the lower rungs on the ladder. I expect to see demographics within the film industry skew a bit older over the next decade because of this.",1430246028

If you design/code a solution to one set of problems using an underlying set of assumptions and when someone shows up and changes those assumptions it doesn&#x27;t matter if your using an agile process or a heavyweight waterfall process. The only difference is going to be in the amount of time it takes to iterate the design and tear the existing product apart and rebuild it with the new set of assumptions.<p>The real savings with &quot;agile&quot; methodologies is the understanding that the code is the documentation. This doesn&#x27;t free you from having requirements or design documents, it just allows you to spend less time on that part of the process. For any sufficiently complex project not having block diagrams of how everything fits together, and basic documentation of subsystem interfaces just means you waste a ton of time reading the detailed implementation before you can understand how the system works.<p>In other words its the same problem you have with heavyweight processes. If you have to read 500 pages of design documents to understand how to integrate your routine, that is the same has having to read 50,000 lines of code to understand how to integrate a piece of code.",1430244671

For IO/State, the idea is basically, if you wite a function that <i>does</i> something, you have to test it by doing that thing, so, instead, let&#x27;s write <i>recipes</i> to do things, and then run them (recipes here just being sets of instructions - not trying to make a weird kitchen metaphor, just seemed more clear than &quot;build computations&quot;). Then, the code to build the recipes can be pure, and we can maybe do neat things like check recipes for equality, change up how we run them to do practice runs while taking notes, pass the recipes around and modify them, and build up libraries of not just recipes, but recipe modifications. A nice side effect is that it lends itself really well to separation of concerns/testable code - if your language is type-checked, it enforces it. If not, it&#x27;s kind of optional, but there&#x27;s not much reason not to keep it pure, since you&#x27;re effectively doing dependency injection already. It&#x27;s useful for non-side-effecty things, too - for State monads without side-effects, our &quot;recipe&quot; is a state machine, and it means we&#x27;re being explicit about our inputs, which also makes it easy to do stuff like lookahead - changing the state and then dropping back to a previous one.<p>It turns out this style of recipe-building, when you get down to the minimal stuff you need for it, is really useful for any sort of computation-in-a-context (for a recipe, the result of running the recipe is the value &quot;in&quot; the context - you can &quot;modify&quot; it by adding to the recipe, same as you can &quot;modify&quot; a function&#x27;s return value by composing it with another function). Basically, the interface says that &quot;return&quot; lets you put something in a context, &quot;join&quot; describes how you can compose contexts, and kleisli-compose says that if you have two functions that return results in a context ( a -> ctx(b) and b -> ctx(c) ), you can compose those functions by composing the resulting contexts with &quot;join&quot;. The end result is that if you have some context, like a recipe, you can apply changes to it (&quot;bind&quot;). In fact, if you have no context (the Identity monad) kleisli-compose reduces to just normal function composition, and bind reduces to application.<p>TL;DR: separation of concerns is a really nice side-effect of what&#x27;s just a really broadly applicable interface for &quot;more complicated but still composable stuff&quot;.",1430244338

9454142,comment,9453381,9453909,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Speaking as one of the founders of Servo, the reason why it couldn&#x27;t be written in Go is absolutely about performance.<p>As far as we&#x27;re concerned, the most compelling reason for Servo to exist is performance, especially in layout and rendering. Many of the wins of Servo layout have come from carefully coding to the optimizer to allow it to eliminate virtual dispatch and procedure call overhead, break apart structures, stack-allocate where possible, and (in the future) use SIMD. As a result, the performance profile of most of Servo layout tends toward flat loops as opposed to deeply nested stacks of virtual call upon virtual call—much friendlier to the branch predictor, i-cache, and intraprocedural optimizations. At the same time, we get a lot of responsiveness wins from having a threaded design where pauses in one thread—most importantly, JS and the DOM—do not impact responsiveness in the other threads, which becomes very important when CSS animations are involved, especially common ones that require reflows.<p>Now with Go, we&#x27;d have the choice between a compiler that basically doesn&#x27;t do any optimizations beyond very simple ones (6g/8g) and a compiler that lacks good GC integration (gccgo). The former would negate all of the advantages of our careful coding to the optimizer and would probably make Servo layout, <i>in parallel mode</i>, slower than the sequential layout of other browsers. (Despite what djb says, compiler optimizations really matter!) And the latter would cause the stop-the-world GC times to spike, jeopardizing our smooth animations, which arguably matters even more than raw reflow performance to the user experience. (That&#x27;s not even counting the fact that since Go&#x27;s malloc is reportedly extremely slow compared to that of Java, it relies heavily on escape analysis, which gccgo doesn&#x27;t do…)<p>There are other reasons too, such as the fact that integrating a good JS garbage collector and Go&#x27;s garbage collector would basically be impossible without rewriting one of them and making major sacrifices along the way (like making JS GC multithreaded or making Go&#x27;s GC conservative, like Blink did with Oilpan). But performance is the main reason.",1430244189
9454141,comment,9453381,9453381,0,0,rakoo,,,"> Having interfaces be autoimplemented [...] it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m used to and it restricts me from writing certain types of code without using dummy methods like so to get static type safety.<p>There&#x27;s a Go idiom for that. If you have<p><pre><code>  type Doer interface {
    Do()
  }
</code></pre>
and a<p><pre><code>  type thing struct {
  }
</code></pre>
and you want to make sure that `thing`s implement `Doer`, just add this line:<p><pre><code>  var _ Doer = thing{}
</code></pre>
_ is a special value that can be redefined at will, so the pattern can be used as many times as needed. From there, the meaning should be straightforward: _ is a `thing` that implements `Doer`, so the compiler will check it. You get to keep implicit interfaces, that you can make explicit as you need.<p>Apart from that, this post is really great; as someone &quot;used&quot; to Go and not at all to Rust this kind of impressions is always enlightening.",1430244180

For a corporate client the time and expense and the risk of dealing with you will equal or exceed the $450.  Think about the project manager that is going to have to order your service: $450 is not a lot but they are going to have to explain it to others and it's going to look embarrassing if you turn out to be just some random dude on the internet who takes their money and then sends them a bunch of 'duh' statements about their web site.   They have a very CYA mentality, which like it or not you have to deal with.<p>To get started perhaps you could think about a 'first taste is free' model where you do a review of part of their site (say, 1 page) with no obligation and then based on that they can go to their manager and justify the expense.",1219633168

There is nothing to say that you will get paid more working in the ""productive"" farm, especially when ""high productivity"" is defined as ""you doing more work for less money with the same tools"".<p>The farmer has all the data, he sets your pay, and he wants you to work for minimum wage. The trick used to boost the amount of work done was to reduce the influence that the workers had on their pay, not to increase their pay.<p>Doing some quick calculations using the numbers in the paper linked to from the article, (and assuming that the farmer was successful in setting his pay structure so that those working the least were paid a minimum wage of £5/hr), those working the hardest worked harder (from 8.05 kg/hr to 12.16 kg/hr) but got paid less (from £22.45/hr to £12.28/hr).<p>Assuming you don't care whether the farm goes out of business or not (you're only working there for one summer) which one would you like to work in again?",1219632109

From location1, if you just want to be able to make your working copy look like origin/<branchname>, you don't have to create a new branch. You can checkout on a tracking branch.  You just can't do all your normal work there (i.e., when you want to commit, you'd need to checkout a branch to commit on).  If you want to create local branches that track all the remote branches, the command you're currently using (minus the --track option) is what you need.<p>As for deleting a branch, the simplest way is to not push branches that you're not going to keep.  I understand what your context is, so you'll likely be stuck with maintaining branches in your central repository.<p>There's not a dramatic simplification I can see in your workflow, but here's where Git's strong-suit really kicks in: it's very, very scriptable.  It would be nearly trivial to write simple bash scripts to do most of this in one command (you might even be able to get there with aliases).",1219631927

Therefore, my thinking is that a more feasible approach in the short term is to show that I actually produce good results. Establishing that I'm an expert is something that will take time.

285575,comment,285046,285525,0,0,DougBTX,,,"<i>After the new methods of payment were introduced, the more productive workers could earn more by being more productive.</i><p>The change was to do the calculation of how much to pay per kg before the day's work, rather than after. The most productive were always paid the most, and the least productive were still paid as close to minimum wage as possible.<p>With the rate set at the start of the day, the people working in a particular field had no control over that day's pay per kg. As noted in footnote 5, the workers also had little control over the price for future days, because it was harder for them to correlate their productivity with the pay rate:<p><i>First, ... it is difficult for workers to disentangle changes in the piece rate due to changing conditions and those due to management learning about workers' true ability ... Second, the effect of a worker's current performance on the unit wage she faces in the future is weak as the unit wage is field-day specific and workers are reallocated to different fields in different days</i><p>So, instead of using the day's average, the farmer sets the rate based on an historical average, or a direct measurement of how hard a particular field is to work. In either case, it disconnects how hard someone works, and how much the they get paid that day. This makes collusion between workers harder, as they can no-longer game the system by forcing those directly working with them to work less. They would need co-operation between everyone working on the farm - a level of control that only the farm owner has.<p>Looking at Table 1, you'll see that productivity rises from 4.92 kg/hr to 8.06 kg/hr. The difference between the hardest workers and the weakest workers can be approximated using the standard deviation, which went from 3.13 to 4.10. Putting that into a little table:<p><pre><code>                  weakest workers      hardest workers
    kg/hr before  1.79                  8.05
    kg/hr after   4.93                 12.16
</code></pre>
Now, we know that the farmer will set the pay rate so that the weakest workers receive minimum wage. For simplicity, we can call the minimum wage £5 an hour. In the ""before"" case, he must pay £5 for 1.79 kg, so the pay rate = 5/1.79 = £2.79/kg. And ""after"", he must pay only 5/4.93 = £1.01/kg. This gives the following table:<p><pre><code>                  weakest workers      hardest workers
         before   £5.00/hr             £22.45/hr
         after    £5.00/hr             £12.28/hr
</code></pre>
Now you can clearly see ars's worry. The hardest workers are picking 50% more, but are being paid almost 50% less, while the weakest workers pick 175% more, but are paid the same amount.<p>No wonder the farmer was pleased, but it is hard to see how the workers will be happy with the ""work harder and then you will get paid more"" line.",1219630193
285574,comment,285107,285408,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>More difficult is coming up with something that could take its place, provide an educated populace, and best allocate people to the educational paths that would serve them best</i><p>Well, for starters, we could return exactly to the system of, say, 1890.  Most people had enough formal schooling to learn reading, writing and arithmetic.  After that, you could learn on the job or through apprenticeship.  Professions such as architects or engineers required 0 - 4 years of post-secondary education.  High school drop outs designed great structures such as the New York Public Library, the tunnels under London, or the California aqueducts.  Now legal credentialing laws mandate architects have 5-8 years of university.  Yet the architecture of the late 1800's is far, far, far superior to the architecture of today.  Perhaps if we abolished the architecture schools altogether, and the professors had to find new careers in, say, stone masonry, people would build beautiful buildings again...<p>The trouble with the idea that ""the truth is somewhere in the middle"" is that the middle changes through time and place.  For example, the average voter in 1900 was a hard-core libertarian compared to the average voter today.  If you lived in 1900 would you be libertarian?  What ideology would you have if you lived in 1965 China?  Was the truth somewhere in between Deng and Mao?  You accuse the people who say ""government should get out of the way"" as being simplistic.  But to me, the people who automatically believe the truth is always in the middle are even more simplistic.<p>The only way to find the answers is find it for yourself.  I was once far more liberal/progressive.  But after numerous life experiences, plus concentrated reading on almost every political subject, I have come to believe that the far right libertarians ( ie, more libertarian than even Milton Friedman) are the closest to being correct.<p>Imagine you were in a conversation with a 1900 libertarian.  What evidence from the world of 2008 would you show him that would prove his libertarianism wrong?  Would you show him our bombed out inner cities as evidence of the glories of the welfare state?  ( compare a 1900 account of the slums, <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=8kEAAAAAYAAJ&dq=the+slums+of+baltimore+chicago+new+york&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=_ZCcPFQvPC&sig=9_23__B3M4QUdLRjtPGhdxpQvIo&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=8kEAAAAAYAAJ&...</a> to a modern account like ""The Corner"" or ""Gang Leader for a day"" )  Would you show him the public schools?  The fine learning going on at our state colleges?  Would you show him the wonderful Brutalist buildings that our fully credentialed architects produce?  Do you think you could convince him that creating a Federal Reserve made the financial system more stable?<p>As for the original question about the origins of American public schooling - I don't think Gatto is completely right, but he's much closer to the truth than 99% of Americans would realize.  A few years ago I took a course on the history of American education.  I was shocked to find the progressives who created American schooling did not care at all about students learning or even job training.  The original reasons were about Americanizing and assimilation of immigrants in American values.  Later on, the emphasis shifted more towards socialization.  Actual learning did not become the primary goal until the much later on.  The irony is that public schools were originally created by the upper class progressives to control the lower classes.  But by 1980, the elimination of tracking and the restrictions of disciplinary actions made public schools uninhabitable by upper class children, thus forcing them into home schooling or expensive private schools.",1219630183

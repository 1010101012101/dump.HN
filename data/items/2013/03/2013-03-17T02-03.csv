5387865,comment,5385639,5385639,1,0,goldfeld,,,"I see this as part of a bigger problem, which is a lack of gusto in Sillicon Valley. People aren't striving to solve problems deeply meaningful to themselves, they are looking for the next big buck in social/local/corny. Others are just as much going after whatever seems to have money in it rather than some problem domain they could be passionate about. Then, of course, if you haven't some problem that truly bugs your existence, you're gonna cash out and live like a fat cow as soon as you can. I could never understand people aiming for exits. Exit? I want to change the world! Or a tiny bit of it. But MY tiny bit.<p>Passion, people! I know the term gets thrown around a lot and it often doesn't mean as much as people make it, but I'd say a minimum of passionate involvement with your problem domain would be nice to find in SV more often. I know I can never rest on my laurels until I've brought down at least one big corporation by doing what they do in an open source, anarchic, power to the people way. Hell, I want to bring down the www, have it lose mindshare to a fully peer-to-peer network, but bluetooth doesn't cut it. I hate these walled gardens, I fear for our future which they can undermine, and I wouldn't want to contribute to more of these gardens, pretty on the inside with unicorns and flowers, until you reach a wall and see surveillance equipment and people shot down trying to escape.<p>But what do VCs know? They're in for a buck, and so are most companies who get big enough to lose it's founder's initial vision. Some companies are founded on a great vision, to solve a passion imbued problem, to give true value to society. O'Reilly has been discussed here recently and it rekindled a lot of my beliefs. I don't want to be at the helm of some billion-dollar ex-startup if I'm just gonna be a puppet to a board of investors. I'd rather stay lean, hungry and foolish, make a true crowd business out of my problem domain, where my software is open source and lots of third-parties have a go at profit. I'm just one of them, thriving on an open ecosystem. That sounds better. I like what App.net is doing. More people should follow the lead.",1363488821

5387853,comment,5387231,5387702,2,0,alan_cx,,,"Socialism and capitalism are tools, not complete methods to run and provide for a country's people, or society. No country exists as purely one or the other. Every country is a shade of socialist and capitalist grey. Even the US has a huge amount of socialist spending. The huge military for starters, all that money that goes via the military to the industries that supply it. Money straight in to jobs. And so on....<p>Socialism is basically government spending. That is all. Capitalism is the bit that raises the money for the government spending. The very simple problem is when the balance goes wrong. The balance has gone wrong, every where.<p>Thing is, what the anti socialists seem very keen to forget is that this all kicked off with subprime loans, badly regulated, free market loans, not government loans or spending. That was us, the public and its ever increasing demands for personal borrowing, and capitalism absolutely lapped it up, until it failed. Capitalism failed, not socialism. Capitalism ran rampant and crashed. Luckily socialist levied money was there to bail it out. The bail outs are government spending. If government didn't have money to bail them out, they would have catastrophically failed. I assume the anti socialists wanted the banks to fail? Fair enough actually, that is how capitalism works, the weak fail. In some ways, I think the banks should have failed. But, if we are to get angry at 10% of people money being converted in to bank shares (did people miss that? It is a bullet point here: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21818598"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21818598</a> ), then losing everything in a bank fail must be very much a no no. So, we do like government spending when it suits.<p>So, one cannot complain about the spending when it was the money provider, capitalism, that screwed up in the first place, leaving no money to spend.<p>Put it this way: If Mr Hubby lose his job, its not the wife's fault for spending the family budget each week, is it? Equally not the wife's fault if she asked Mr Hubby if she could take out a loan, he agreed, and not cant pay it back because hubby lost his job. More, over, if Mr Hubby was pushing her to take loans, it is even more not her fault.<p>So stop with the finger pointing rightard anti socialism hate stuff. It doesn't work, its childish, and way too Glen Beck for sensible discussion.<p>Now, of course the socialism bit has to do its bit and contract so that the capitalism bit can breathe and rebuild, while regulating it enough such that insane lending and borrowing cant happen again. The balance must be restored.",1363488654
5387852,comment,5387402,5387402,1,0,lrei,,,"Sorry but there is no information in the post to justify that using C or assembly is more simple than using python, ruby or clojure. There is also no justification as to why making the code in a library or server simple would result in more complexity down the road. Having written servers, applications and libraries before, I'm left to wonder why making their codebase simpler would result in more complexity down the line. Also I wonder if complexity is being confused with (expressive) power. Simplicity is always a good thing. Lack of others things might not be. The trade-off is usually between simplicity and thought+work put into something. Not functionality/power and simplicity. The shortcut often taken is making things more complicated to make them more powerful without making the effort necessary to make them simple.",1363488611

Yes a country can levy taxes however they like, but a surprise 10% wealth tax is unprecedented. The analogy with VAT/income/property is a bit difficult because in almost any case where a government has instituted those taxes the populous would have fair warning before they went into effect. At least in America, these things weren't enacted overnight with no legislative oversight/debate, and I doubt in any other Developed nation such a thing has occurred.<p>That said, I can understand why they went this route. It's basically a free down payment on an emergency loan mostly provided by wealthy Russians. Again, not illegal, but it isn't exactly just to have foreigners pay for your countries debts. I don't feel terribly sorry, since most of that Russian money likely came from less than reputable means. But as the saying goes, two wrongs don't make a right.<p>But the repercussions will be far reaching. First off, Cyrpus can expect a run on their banks from foreigners. Don't know if they have plans on stopping that, but I don't see why any foreigner would keep money there. Secondly, Smaller countries (and possibly large ones as well) in financially precarious situations will probably start seeing a run on their banks. This can set off contagion in a region without a strong central economic force to stave it off.<p>Though I expect some off-shore type country to pass a law soon stating they will never perform such a tax, and a lot of money will start flowing into their banks.",1363486649

Rationally checked-out. Strategically minimize discomfort.<p>Clueless (middle/managers): non-strategic, eager people who clean up the mess made by Losers below and Sociopaths above them. Give a lot to the company, get mediocre returns. Losers are actually less ""losing"", because they know the trade they are making. Clueless expect to be rich, respected, or secure one day but hit a glass ceiling (Effort Thermocline, the highest one can go by working hard rather than smart) and never get it.<p>Sociopaths (top/executives): strategic and hard-working, but insubordinate and risk <i>seeking</i>. Take the other side of Loser risk-selling and turn it into personal gain. Good at engineering situations so that upside risk goes to them and downside goes to others (often Clueless).<p>MacLeod Losers are most of the workforce, and it's relatively easy to turn a reliable profit on one. You pay him a pittance X, and he gives you labor worth 1.25<i>X, and at scale you can make a lot of money this way. However, if you're trying to build a brand or reputation quickly and impress people (press/investors) your </i>average* productivity per person matters, not your <i>sum</i> profit. MacLeod Losers, who reliably return a small-but-positive profit for the company, bring that economically unimportant but socially relevant average down.<p>VC-istan is a world without MacLeod Losers. MacLeod Sociopaths are the investors and tech press and executives who are brought in by VCs after the company's de-risked. But VC-istan startups (founders and employees) are all-Clueless. That's why ""you should want to work 55 hours a week because you really want to"" in VC-istan. That's why being a ""true believer"" in the company matters more than being able to do the job. That's why there's such an age discrimination problem. They're looking for Clueless.<p>What keeps a company or system stable is the Effort Thermocline. It's the interface between Clueless and Sociopaths and it's the point where jobs become easier with increasing rank instead of harder. (Clueless are often oblivious to its existence.) It's the glass ceiling that you can't cross unless you work smart and ""get it"". The unconditional work ethic of, e.g., the macho brogrammer only gets you to upper-tier Clueless.

There have been shortcomings in some countries in the past. It is not feasible or necessary to provide schemes with an amount of money equivalent to all deposits. But banks will have to pay on a regular basis to the schemes, in advance, so a pot of money can be built up, and not only after a bank failure. Such 'ex-ante funds' will make up 75% of the overall funds in DGS.<p>If it becomes necessary, banks will have to pay additional contributions, which will contribute a further 25% of the target funds. If this is still insufficient, Deposit Guarantee Schemes could borrow from each other (""mutual borrowing facility"") up to a certain limit (again 25% of target funds) or use additional funding sources such as borrowing on the financial market, e.g. by issuing bonds.<p>The new financing requirements will ensure that each scheme has enough funds in place to deal with a medium-size bank failure. This level is comparable to the existing well-financed schemes in the EU. These levels of funding will have to be achieved in all Member States by 2020.<p>Banks having a riskier business model than others will pay higher contributions to Deposit Guarantee Schemes - up to about 3 times more.</i>""",1363485688

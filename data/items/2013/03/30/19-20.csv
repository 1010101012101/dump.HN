5466469,comment,5465948,5466112,4,0,bastijn,,,"no offense, but you sound like a programmer at either a small, or maybe medium sized conpany. Where code is all known to you, and touched by you (based upon your 'when I code..' sentence used). I regularly run into bugs that take longer than several hours to find, not talking about fixing. I admit, not the thing you like to get in an ideal world, but all the more you run into in the real world. Deadlines and 10+ year old platforms introduce hacks, and untested code.<p>back to the original post; i kind of like this in a mildly manner. as said in another comment, I also tend to hunt until I recognize a lockup. At that time I step back, walk to a drawing board and invite some colleagues to hear my brain pondering and running over several options while visualizing the pipeline on the board. This gives me three things:\n- experience of other colleagues\n- visualization of the problem to get clear what is happening.\n- probably coffee and some smalltalk over completely different things which at that time seem completely logical to originate from the thing explained. It relaxes me.<p>Back at my desk Im all fresh again, new ideas to try out etc. Bottom line, sometimes taking a step back helps for me as well. Although I like to see it as a last resort, while I (now again) know I should start doing this more often, and especially at an earlier stage.<p>To end with the start, when you run in a multiple day bug you should immediatly write a test for it, after solving. Make sure you dont run in it again :).",1364673509

5466459,comment,5465023,5465281,1,0,heliodor,,,"I've worked at two companies where the day starts at 10am. You'd be surprised how common this is. For people without families and who live in big cities like New York, flex time allows you to go out at night any given night, have a good time, not miss out on sleep, and still have a full day of work by waking up at 9am or 10am. When someone in your team suggests to start the standup fifteen minutes earlier so that no two teams' standups overlap, how do you respond? ""I don't want to wake up 15 minutes earlier"", or silence?<p>Morning stands up are a great way for management to ensure people are pressured into showing up for work at a given time without having to be the bad guy and actually say it.<p>My experience with morning standups is that people arrive to work right before the standup or a few minutes into it, are not in the right mindset to form coherent sentences about their work, and as a result the standup is a slow monotone monologue that no one pays attention to. The one day a week when the manager joins the standup to listen in, everyone faces him and it becomes a report trying to look good and sound like they accomplished a lot that day.<p>Bottom line, skip the physical standup and use Trello instead!",1364673401

That said, it should be an <i>interesting</i>, engaging, and satisfying education.  Not just ""because I should"".<p>2) And, <i>that said</i>, keep your eye open towards to possibility(s) of turning this into a 5 (5.5, 6?) year Masters track.  I guess I'm of two minds about this.  My understanding from others is that, particularly in the shorter timeframe, such a curriculum might squeeze out time and opportunity for some other topics -- you might miss things you would find of significant value.  But, it can be a more direct path to a more valuable degree and perhaps to a deeper educational experience in your topic of interest -- if this does indeed mesh with your interests.<p>So, I'll say, look into such opportunities.  Whether you ultimately decide to sign up for such a path is a matter of whether it would be right for your (and what opportunities end up presenting themselves -- or, perhaps better stated, what you can shake loose, and at what cost).<p>P.S.  A difficult, hard, challenging professor is one thing.  A crap professor is another (and, believe me, they do exist -- whether their <i>attitude</i> is malicious, disengaged, or even ostensibly helpful).  Don't waste too much time on the latter.  Nor work too hard to avoid the former; I remember one math(s) professor with a somewhat fearsome reputation, but boy did you learn!  :-)",1364673252

While I appreciate your need to know what's going on with the team, in Agile and Scrum, the daily stand-up isn't there to provide status to managers.<p>The purpose of the meeting is for the team to get together and co-ordinate the work that needs to be done in order to meet their Sprint goals. So while you may be able to get status information out of that, it's more important for team members to use that time to figure out how to meet their goals.<p>In addition, status should be obvious in Agile teams.

So do men, however when men get married and have children they tend to continue to work, whereas it's more common for women to leave the workforce. Hence, the percentage of the men in the city that go home to their family in Connecticut (or Westchester, or whatever) is much higher than the percentage of women that do so.

5466432,comment,5463210,5463210,2,0,benaston,,,"My experience is mainly with OKCupid. I presume most other dating websites are variations on the same theme.<p>The problem is that OKCupid is a geek's worldview distilled. Whether a girl is visible to you is largely based upon algorithmic analysis of a questionnaire, which in turn is based on nothing more than pseudoscience.<p>So you have a questionnaire written by a team of computer programmers acting as gatekeeper to you contacting someone? Do you see the potential problem here? Who says the questionnaire is relevant?<p>Add to this fact that the quality of women on these sites is low on average, and it doesn't bode well for guys. Lots of guys will of course chime in and say it works for them. My interpretation of this is that given the sheer number of users, there will always be people who ""luck out"".<p>Cupid Plc (another online dating company, unrelated to OKCupid) is under heavy suspicion in the UK for faking high quality female profiles. I don't know if OKCupid does this, but the site really has no built-in mechanism to give you much trust in the profiles you see.<p>Overall, I think the problem with online dating websites is that they are not actually solving any of the difficult problems of dating. Online profiles are useless because they are 90% equivalent. Oh, so you like tall, athletic men? And you enjoy movies and wine, music, art and watching Game of Thrones? You are mainly good, but have a wild side? You are unique?<p>Given this, why the focus on these profiles? Guys are only interested in the photos (having put the effort into reading through fifty identikit profiles already).<p>...and then there's the transition to meeting up. This is fraught with difficulty because you have know way of gauging how to approach the issue. For some people ""let's meet"" will be enough and looked upon positively as decisive and confident. For others it is seen as completely inappropriate. The site gives you, the guy - it will usually be the guy  - no way of knowing which strategy to use and so you lose 50% (or more) of the time on the basis of not having enough information to make a good  decision. Given already low probability of finding someone who ""suits"" you on these sites, this is incredibly wasteful and not addressed.<p>So... good luck to anyone trying to improve things.",1364672848

It's perfectly snappy, the screen's resolution is stunning (although the colors aren't as good as what you'd get from an AMOLED phone), the automatic screen brightness always works perfectly, and the OS is great at just getting out of the way. That said, I feel like it's still a beta product.<p>From my own experience and from reading various forums, enabling encryption has a decent chance of putting your phone in a state where it will randomly and frequently reboot. At least, that's the theory; I'm in the process of disabling encryption now, so soon I should know whether that makes the reboots go away. Other than that, some of the setup is a bit weird, and other things just take some getting used to.<p>The app store (BlackBerry World) is a bit empty. I've found most of the apps that I need, but if you're looking for a specific app (especially anything from Google), prepare to be disappointed. I haven't started doing any development, but the docs generally look good, and I'm really excited to get my feet wet with Qt Quick on a phone. I think they made the right choice there, although I haven't actually gotten into it yet.<p>So, overall, I do think the Z10 has great potential.

5466336,comment,5465023,5465023,1,0,ascotan,,,"Having been a project lead and scrum master in the past, I've found there are a few real purposes to scrum imho.<p>1. It should be a place were the lead helps people coordinate. Not just work, but their schedules. If dev A will be finishing up widget A on Wed. then dev B knows he needs to hustle, etc.<p>2. It's a place where QA can get a grip on what's happening in development. Most of the time QA has no idea what's going on in dev, and having the QA guys in scrum helps them.<p>3. It forces lazy devs (who spend all day on youtube) to actually report status the next day in front of all the other devs.<p>A few more thoughts.<p>1. It should be around 15 minutes. Too short and it just becomes a round robin. That's great, but a lead should be able to adjust the work and coordinate at scrum. You can't really do that in 3-5 minutes. If it's too long, the devs get cranky because you're killing their dev time.<p>2. No PMs.  Project managers imho should not attend scrums because they speak a different language (it's called powerpoint) and they usually a) don't understand what's being said b) freak out when qa says there's a bug c) like to get on a soapbox about schedules and releases when it's not appropriate.<p>It's far better to have the lead/leads manage the PM separately be delivering separate status reports to him directly (either through email or a formal report-like deliverable).<p>3. No more than 10 people. I would say around 6 is best, but you can't have a 15 minute scrum, when the number of people is too large.  If you have more people, you need to split them into groups of 6-10 and then have a 'superscrum' for the leads. This type of 'superscrum' is great for have the PM join in, because it can focus mainly on resource management and schedules (which is what PMs love to talk about).<p>@OP I've actually have asked for people to report status via email (particularly when I have a bunch of remote guys), and it's really terrible. You end up getting a bunch of emails which you have to respond to. That's great if your a developer and you can put you AD LIB email on a cron job for the lead, but for the lead, the coordination of the team via email will eat up most of your morning. It simply better to call in or show up and everyone be in the same room for 15 minutes.",1364670814

The mechanical issues are a side effect of that.""<p>I have two problems with this reasoning.  First, C is being used for more than writing device drivers; most programs written in C are not device drivers.  Second, and more important, is that low-level memory access and the sort of bit-twiddling you are talking about can be done in Common Lisp, and I doubt that you would be shocked to know that the operating systems written in Lisp for Lisp Machines had device drivers.  It is possible for any high-level language to expose a low-level pointer type, and doing so will not force programmers to use such low-level constructs in higher-level code.<p>""As for design errors, they are hard to prevent anywhere.""<p>While true, they are much harder to prevent in C because of the complicated semantics, the enormous amount of undefined behavior, and the plethora of edge cases one must account for.  When something as simple as incrementing a counter forces you to deal with edge cases and potentially undefined behavior, it is pretty hard to verify that a C program actually implements a design, even when that design was formally specified and checked.  The lack of high-level features and constructs worsens this situation by inflating the number of lines of code in an implementation.",1364670137

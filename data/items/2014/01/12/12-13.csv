7045873,comment,7044690,7044690,20,0,apunic,,,"Loneliness is severe. Stopping this feeling is quite hard and I slightly doubt that the article&#x27;s content will help but as somebody wrote, it&#x27;s a great start to dig deeper.<p>1. What one needs: ideally, you have a significant other (SO) -- I know it&#x27;s damn hard to get one but let&#x27;s first understand why a SO is the number one fix for loneliness. The SO is somebody no one else can replace, even not your best friends. Why? There are many reasons but the most important is that we all require a lot of communication and interaction with like-minded people to be happy -- this is one of our core needs and if this is lacking just one (!) day we get depressed. A SO fulfills those communication and interaction needs much better than any other person because the quantity of communication with your SO can be very high while the quality can be low. So, what does it mean? You can call your SO anytime and tell her really minor stuff like &#x27;they have awesome apples in the store, shall I get some?&#x27; or when going to bed you can talk about how the day went, that traffic today was a pain or you show her some funny posts on Reddit. Just imagine how many words of unimportant communication you exchange with an SO in a week vacation. All this sounds nitty-gritty and totally irrelevant, but the SO is &#x27;always-on&#x27;, will listen to any crap and this is something we terribly need. And you can&#x27;t call or text your best friend or close co-workers before going to bed to tell them that today&#x27;s apples were really juicy. Moreover, we get other amenities like sex or endearment.<p>2. If no SO is present then the next thing you need to not feel lonely are good or very good friends or let&#x27;s call them best friends, people who you really connect to. To find those is as hard as finding your SO and usually you don&#x27;t get that a person is about to be your best friend before meeting him/her over a long period of time. But &#x27;best friends&#x27; won&#x27;t stay -- it doesn&#x27;t take too long and the connection you had with them loosens up but you still stick to them (because they &#x27;are&#x27; your best friends), so don&#x27;t spend too much time on finding the &#x27;best&#x27; friend, any friend will do. However, best friends are important but can not replace a SO.<p>3. The next level of people you need or are rather nice to have are close or like-minded co-workers. But this is something you shouldn&#x27;t aspire for and those connections are very fragile/dynamic because work and life sometimes doesn&#x27;t play well together and disappointment is hard-wired. Still, best friends can be won from co-workers.<p>So, we know now what we need, let&#x27;s now find an answer to the question how to get there.<p>Finding a SO is very hard and the best way is to go out and create as many leads as possible -- very helpful is the PUA literature, just google it and find tons of wisdoms. A lot of stuff is crappy but you will find as much excellent advice there. And don&#x27;t think that good looks is the key to find your SO, it makes life a bit easier but it&#x27;s definitely not the key.<p>Similar to before you should go out and meet many, many people -- very good for this are meet-ups.<p>But the most important thing: you should NEVER go out and look for <i>the</i> SO or <i>the</i> best friend. This doesn&#x27;t work and makes you ultra needy and people will find you awkward. Simultaneously, you will be disappointed because everybody you meet seems to be a douche, so start slowly and don&#x27;t expect wonders. Connect to MANY people and try to keep relationships superficial, slowly intense those relationship which look promising but look that you still connect to MANY people because most people won&#x27;t match (for being a SO or best friend). A hint: good matches are usually your close peers, people who are in similar situations, contexts and/or face same challenges. However, to have a good evening often you do not need a best friend (of course it&#x27;s better and more convenient to have one) but sometimes just some random people work out too. What can also help: find a personal mission you pursue which is NOT &#x27;finding best friends&#x27;, starting a startup, a meetup, whatever -- to create a relationship you need always some hook.<p>And then after few months everything will come by itself. It&#x27;s definitely some work involved but everybody can master it, even the introverts (which is just often a weak excuse).<p>To survive the lonely times before -> exercise every day, eat and live well and most important, stop any kind of drugs, they make your lonely times even worse.<p>A side note regarding founders, when starting their business entrepreneurs have a hard time but this struggle will be rewarded in future and feeling lonely is often part of the job.",1389531146

7045864,comment,7044818,7045106,2,0,ckoepp,,,"The problem currently is that we actually don&#x27;t know how the brain works. I know a lot of people claiming that they&#x27;ve found out - but if you dig deeper you&#x27;ll find most experiments only work in certain cultures and are far from being THE theory which explains everything. I mean nobody today can actually be sure that the power at which a synapse is firing has a meaning. We simply have no idea - it may have significant influence but we&#x27;re far from proving it (can&#x27;t find the paper describing this, as I&#x27;m not able to connect to the university network currently).<p>This is bad news - especially for the AI-robotics guys, as they need this knowledge to implement the next generation of smart robots. They hope to get some &quot;self reprogrammable robots&quot; as this is what your brain seems to do all the time.<p>So what do we technicians do? We&#x27;re trying to build a machine to simulate a brain (and hope we&#x27;re right in our assumption how the brain works). There is a huge project like this going on in the EU too [1]. This is the bottom-up approach and it&#x27;s far from all the press releases as there are too many assumptions in it - even if those guys hate to hear it. There is a nice documentary film with Jospeh Weizenbaum (former professor at MIT and close friend of Chromsky) about this very issue and its ethical aspects [2].<p>The up-down approach is researched by system biologists (and other related sciences). They aim at the bio-chemical and physical layers to figure out how a brain works and it seems like this is complicated as hell. We&#x27;re some kind of programmable - even if nobody can tell how far this actually goes. Just being raised in different cultures can have significant influence in how a brain reacts in situations. Even siblings with the same DNA and are being raised within the very same family you can find differences in how their brain reacts...<p>So don&#x27;t get too excited about all this - we&#x27;re far away from being &quot;downloadable&quot;. Which is maybe not the worst thing if you&#x27;re thinking about it for a while. What would life mean if it&#x27;s endless? And by the way: even if you were downloadable, what tells you that you&#x27;re still alive if a copy of your brain is stored within an robot?

7045863,comment,7044881,7045787,6,0,thaumasiotes,,,"Evolution knows no future, but it still makes sense to talk about evolution being prepared for a possible future.  In particular, what ronaldx is saying is quite close to the accepted explanation for sexual reproduction.  Sex produces, and maintains, a great deal of variety within the population that you won&#x27;t see in an asexually reproducing one.  It also imposes a very large penalty to the speed at which the population can grow (males, roughly half of any sexual population, cannot reproduce at all).  It is felt that, historically, sexual populations have been so much more able to weather changing circumstances, because of the variability that their lifestyle ensures, that it must have outweighed the susbstantial reproductive penalty -- since sexual organisms have taken over virtually every ecological niche in the world. And this is for an adaptation <i>the entire purpose of which</i> is to guard the population against the future.<p>In summary: variability in the gene pool is a form of future protection, and one that has been specifically selected for.

It can totally understand that people don&#x27;t take it easily. And it&#x27;s especially hard if you are already using a certain framework and feeling good with it.<p>I can see from your comment that you are biased towards MVVP and Angular in particular. You prefer to express the logic in the HTML template and use two-way data binding and avoid using jQuery (Official Angular suggestion). It&#x27;s a very different approach and you cannot really compare Riot and Angular directly. It&#x27;s a much broader comparison between MVP and MVVM patterns. A massive topic.<p>I strongly think that MVP scales much better than MVVP and is better for bigger applications/teams. It&#x27;s easier structure the codebase in modular fashion.

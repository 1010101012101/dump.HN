86031,comment,85840,85855,0,0,jkush,,,"House of Leaves is so good! I have yet to come up with a good description of what it's about, but I always try when I tell people about it.<p>I usually describe it as a story about a guy who finds a manuscript. The manuscript is a collection of essays that detail a documentary that was made about a house that randomly changes rooms. <p>So at the center of the novel, you have this really creepy story. But there are all the layers above that storyline that you have to read to get there. There's the storyline concerning the people who make the documentary. Then there's the storyline of the guy who wrote the manuscript ABOUT the documentary. Then you have the storyline of the guy who's reading the documentary.<p>Then there's you. You're reading about a guy who is in turn  reading a manuscript about a documentary which was made about a house. It was so well done that at the end, I found myself not really sure what the hell I was reading anymore.<p>I'm still not sure what the book is, but it's certainly a stroke of genius. <p>",1196794259
86030,comment,85761,85776,0,0,gregwebs,,,"Chess and poker are fundamentally different problems.\nUnfortunately this argument is going to come down to arguing about the definition of ""complex"" and things like that.<p>But I will still reiterate these points:<p>1. A great deal more effort has gone into computer chess than computer poker.  When that amount of effort is put into computer poker, computers will be better than humans at poker.<p>2. The argument can be made that poker is harder or more complex than chess for computers, but the opposite is definitely true of humans today.  If you don't study chess hard from the age of ten and then dedicate your life to it starting in your teens, you can't be the best.  The amount of study (not playing) is probably an order of magnitude difference.  In practice this means that any great chess player could switch to poker, study hard, play hard, and have a chance at making it, but no great poker players could switch to chess.<p>Fundamentally, sports in which real money is gambled will probably never reach the competitive level of play of non-gambling sports.  Chess has a rating system and is setup so that the players of similar calibar play each other.  Contrast this with poker where professionals are always actively seeking to play against worse players (with higher bank rolls).",1196794094

86012,comment,85966,85966,0,0,croby,,,"This, to me, feels similar to the outdated practice of including all  JS in HTML comments for 'older browsers'. Crockford has a good paragraph on this in one of his articles. <p>""The use of HTML comments in scripts dates further back to a transitional problem between Netscape Navigator and Netscape Navigator 2. The latter introduced the <script> tag. However, users of the former would see the script as text because of the HTML convention that unrecognized markup is ignored. The <!-- comment hack stopped being necessary by the time Netscape Navigator 3 came out. It certainly is not needed now. It is ugly and a waste of space.""<p>People use to turn off JavaScript because the web was new and people were using it improperly. Based on the proliferation of everything JS these days, it feels like we've overcome this barrier, just like we've overcome Netscape 2.<p>\nI also feel like the analogy the author makes between 'designing for accessibility' to 'using JavaScript' is improper. I think if the article criticized the usage of Flash, it'd be a different story -- Flash used to be completely inaccessible and it (still) requires someone to download a plugin for it to work. Even so, youtube and the myspace music player (both Flash) are still incredibly popular on the web -- despite that barrier to entry. Something to think about -- maybe prompting to turn on JavaScript solves the problem, just like saying you need to install flash solves the flash problem.",1196792668

Would love some advice:<p>Conduct several changes to effect his lifestyle and make it healthier<p>1. Disconnect the TV and get the 3 seat sofa of the the living room. This way he won&#x27;t fall asleep in front of the TV. This will help him with regular sleep.<p>2. Not buy unhealthy food. Sign up for a service providing fresh salads each day. Put a salad in his car. For him to always have a healthy alternative that&#x27;s easier to obtain than other fatting alternatives.<p>3. Blocks his drive way with wood a metal. Should make him look for parking that atleast 15 mins away from home. 15 mins in each direction is a 30 min daily walk. Force him for some exercise.<p>4. Fill the house with scales. In every room. Scales that can support his weight. For him not to avoid it.<p>5. Define together with him his weight target. Find a dietitian willing to come to our house at 9 pm when he finishes working to help him estimate his progress.<p>6. Getting his brother involved. He appreciates his older brother and enjoys talking to him. Ask for his brother to come over once a week and go walking with him (he lives near by).<p>7. He also has a very good friend from work (they&#x27;ve been working together for 35 years or more). Not sure how he can effectively help though. Ideas?<p>8.

Here&#x27;s a description from that SEC report, onto what went wrong with their monitoring system:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Moreover, because the 33 Account held positions from multiple sources, Knight personnel could not quickly determine the nature or source of the positions accumulating in the 33 Account on the morning of August 1.   Knights primary risk monitoring tool, known as PMON, is a post-execution position monitoring system. At the opening of the market, senior Knight personnel observed a large volume of positions accruing in the 33 Account. However, Knight did not link this tool to its entry of orders so that the entry of orders in the market would automatically stop when Knight exceeded pre-set capital thresholds or its gross position limits. PMON relied entirely on human monitoring and did not generate automated alerts regarding the firms financial exposure. PMON also did not display the limits for the accounts or trading groups; the person viewing PMON had to know the applicable limits to recognize that a limit had been exceeded. PMON experienced delays during high volume events, such as the one experienced on August 1, resulting in reports that were inaccurate.&quot;</code></pre>",1382416688

6589793,comment,6585711,6588586,4,0,teek,,,"I would say that the average Japanese is more worldly not because of their own insight but more because of the rigidity of the culture and the import/export of American/European (Western) culture into the country.<p>Every Japanese essentially grows up in the same exact manner as his/her peers:<p>* primary school (elementary, middle, high school)
* higher education (university/college)
* full time work<p>There is some variation between the sexes but generally that is how it goes for <i>most</i> Japanese. The difference with western culture is that generally each level of school beyond the previous is harder and more worthy than the previous level. In Japan there is an exception: high school is actually harder than college/university.<p>The university system in Japan is pretty much as backwards as you can get. Admissions is the most important aspect of Japanese University. Graduation is pretty much guaranteed and companies hiring new employees fresh out of college base their decision on the <i>name</i> of the university, not based on the individuals accomplishments <i>during</i> university. This means University entrance exams basically become the standard to which all Japanese are judged. As such once a Japanese student reaches his final year in High School, 100% of their effort is devoted to studying for college entrance exams and nothing else.<p>Oddly, after entering a university, most Japanese will treat college as an &quot;extended vacation&quot;. The reason behind this is: companies will only pay attention to your university&#x27;s name (so your employment has already basically been decided upon admission), graduation is basically guaranteed regardless of performance, and Japanese work place ethic enforces overtime as <i>standard</i> not optional. So most Japanese students will take university time as their &quot;time off&quot; and allow themselves to be consumed with all things <i>fun</i> Japanese and non-Japanese.<p>One major way of extending the extended vacation is the option of foreign exchange schools. Many Japanese will use this opportunity as a temporary escape from Japanese culture. But while they may learn a thing or two about other cultures, most foreign exchange students have no other intention other than extending their time away from the pressures of Japanese culture and their own leisure.<p>The other thing I&#x27;d like to address is the notion of the Japanese being &quot;ahead&quot;. They are only ahead in the following categories:<p>* land-use and transit efficiency
* conforming society norms<p>In nearly every other metric they&#x27;ve fallen behind or are behind. The main reason for this is again the rigidity of Japanese culture and the refusal to experiment. There are several reasons for this but the biggest on is in a society where being unique is punished while the conforming act is never punished, it is always a safe move to conform. This means all employees will attempt to take the path with least resistance (conforming path) even if it is the least optimal.<p>The second compounding issue is the notion of &quot;ganbare&quot;. Ganbare is a conjugation of the Japanese verb ganbaru which means to &quot;try one&#x27;s best&quot;. In Japanese culture ganbare is valued more than outcomes. That is a person that tries his hardest is more valuable than a person that uses little effort but is still successful. This basically <i>authorizes</i> the use of unpaid overtime in order to overcome shortcomings in business. Workers will &quot;ganbare&quot; by putting in more hours in order to overcome any challenges--and usually in this act, they feel supported by society and management. The problem is that we have data that shows that prolonged overtime causes burn out and thus productivity actually decreases despite more hours worked. But when your entire society is basically burned out you&#x27;re not going to get any risk takers or even any insightful ideas. You instead have a zombie workforce.<p>I do think Japan can turn around because there are signs of concern and insight among the top ranks in Japan (both government and business) that the status quo is not sustainable. The real question is whether or not they can change some of their core cultural values to adjust to the changing times quick enough.",1382416328

It&#x27;s strange this time; when I occasionally eat these things, I feel slightly, but noticeably ill for about a day afterwards.<p>Anyhow if this type of diet interests you, I want you to check out his blog because it is a slightly different approach than other &quot;paleo&quot;. You need not eat super low carb as long as it is the right type of carbs and you don&#x27;t have a ton of weight to lose. He also suggests cream if you don&#x27;t have leaky gut (I drink tons in coffee every day).<p>These are a couple tidbits from his entry on glucose: <a href=""http://www.archevore.com/panu-weblog/2011/2/5/no-such-thing-as-a-macronutrient-part-ii-carbohydrates-revis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archevore.com/panu-weblog/2011/2/5/no-such-thing-...</a><p>&quot;Glucose is a necessary internal fuel source and metabolite and it is also a food and the building block of foods that have the longest evolutionary history of any food that mammals use. It is a fact that we do not require glucose in the diet, and that we can make it from amino acids if we don&#x27;t eat it. However, rather than viewing this as evidence that glucose is not important, we should view this as evidence that glucose is so metabolically important that we have evolved way to make sure we always have it.&quot; ...<p>&quot;Like glucose, there is no dietary requirement for fructose, but unlike glucose, we do not require fructose for use as an internal fuel. There is no organ like the brain that has an absolute fructose requirement. In fact, our body has mechanisms that evolved specifically to keep most cells from being exposed to too much of it.&quot; ...<p>&quot;To keep fructose out of the general circulation, it must be immediately burned or stored as fat. Fructose is related to the spectrum of serious diseases known as NAFLD (non-alcoholic liver disease), including fatty liver and cirrhosis.&quot;",1382414837

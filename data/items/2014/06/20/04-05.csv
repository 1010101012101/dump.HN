7919569,comment,7919448,7919448,3,0,jlawer,,,"I&#x27;ve really only seen 2 core approaches to this:<p>1.) Free Access to everything. You trust everyone and hope it works out right. This is the simplest solution, but offers nothing to prevent someone violating that trust.<p>2.) Lock production down to a trusted team. Typically this is done with a full dev / ops separation. Dev build the site and test, Ops run it live and have access to the live database. You trust 3 people in ops fully and no one else. Locking down production often entrenches rivalries between dev and ops, and makes debugging performance issues a PITA as dev typically don&#x27;t have access to the dataset that is exhibiting the problem.<p>I&#x27;ve seen both work and both fail, and neither protects you from a trusted employee screwing you over.<p>What I have seen work rather well though is audit logging. Logging all access to the key systems and periodically (and randomly) auditing access. I&#x27;ve seen this done at the db level, system level and app level before. Basically the story is not that you will be prevented from doing something you shouldn&#x27;t, but if you are that you will be held accountable for it (typically on the spot termination). However to be effective the company needs to be able to take the high ground and be consistent. This won&#x27;t work if someone (co-founder, manager) is doing a similar thing and getting away with it.<p>As long as the data isn&#x27;t high value (Credit Cards, etc) enough to make the opportunity cost worth it, knowing you will loose your job provides enough to make most hesitant to break the rules.",1403240008

The policy, disclosed early and often, is that misuse of customer data is an instant firing offense.  Google, Facebook, etc have indeed terminated people over this, often literally count-the-minutes after the fact of the misuse became known to other people at the company.<p>Tech-wise, it&#x27;s spiritually similar to other security measures.  You lock down access on a need-to-have basis, you log the heck out of extraordinary requests for access, and you audit those requests.<p>e.g. <i>Many</i> companies will eventually develop a Use The Software As User X feature.  At some, this requires you to a) be logged in as a privileged employee, then b) click to activate the feature, c) write an explanation why you need access to User #12345&#x27;s account, and d) checkbox that you have receive #12345&#x27;s consent for this.  (I know some companies that skip D, largely in B2C.)  When you hit submit, that logs it to the DB and fires an email to the audits@ email address, which goes out to 5 different people, or pipes &quot;Patrick just logged in as #12345 because [chasing down display bug -- customer reports unescaped HTML in the message window, can&#x27;t reproduce on staging or with own account]&quot; into your team&#x27;s HipChat/etc channel.",1403239348
7919550,comment,7919339,7919504,1,0,vacri,,,"I am disagreeing with the article, because I think it&#x27;s very highly slanted. <i>&quot;Someone with a skill that can be sold for a couple hundred dollars an hour is better off doing that, and then donating their wages to hire at least ten people for ten dollars an hour.&quot;</i>, for example. Because people that actually earn a couple of hundred dollars per hour are just not that common - it&#x27;s arguing from an extreme outlier. The <i>median</i> full-time wage in the US is something like $42k - half of full time employees earn less than this, which works out to ~$20/hour. And only 1/3 of Americans are full-time employees.<p>The arguments about charities not wanting to be swamped by the unskilled are fair points, but at the same time, charities still do need unskilled hands. They just don&#x27;t need crazy amounts of them. The article should have been more about the imbalance in skill requirements, not that charities basically only want experts in the field. And even then, you don&#x27;t need to be a ten-year expert to be skilled enough for a lot of the things a charity work requires. One week&#x27;s pulling cable would be enough experience to really help out with ghshephard&#x27;s example above. Sure, a professional netadmin would be better, but a few days cable-jerking would have made someone baseline useful. Likewise team management skills can be very handy in managing the unskilled hordes, and it doesn&#x27;t take anything like 10 years to gain those kinds of skills.<p>Taking the article on its merits, no-one would be able to volunteer until their late 20s, which is clearly an absurd concept.",1403239317

Over the last year or so we&#x27;ve heard nothing but gloom and doom about how terrible the end of net neutrality would be but hey free unlimited streaming music? That sounds nice. Why didn&#x27;t pro-regulation folks mention that part? It&#x27;s almost like they were intentionally misleading people to further their best interests? Maybe exactly like those ISPs who realized it was in their best interest to break into a new market of companies with multi-million/billion dollar profits who are willing to pay-to-play?<p>> nearly impossible for startups to break into new markets<p>What&#x27;s the point in pretending these startups don&#x27;t have the <i>exact</i> same motivations as ISPs or even other services who opt to pay for the &#x27;fast lane&#x27; to improve their service? Everyone is out to maximize their own profits and since the ole&#x27; economic ladder has a few broken rungs we know the average consumer isn&#x27;t going to magically have more money to spend anytime soon. This has always simply been a debate over who gets to take the money.<p>> only the ones that T-Mobile has approved here.<p>If it&#x27;s all doom and gloom then surely it will create a great opportunity for new players to jump into the ISP market and provide 100% cap free / 100% net neutral / 100% SLA 24x7 guaranteed speeds to consumers. If the issue is as one-sided as we have been led to believe then perhaps companies like FaceBook wouldn&#x27;t be prioritizing their billions on WhatsApp or maybe Apple wouldn&#x27;t be spending billions on Dr. Dre? Maybe instead they would be investing money into jumping into the ISP market? If the top 5 major tech companies in the US banded together and invested even 10% of their revenue in the ISP market this would be a non-issue. So why don&#x27;t they? Turns out they can make more money buying Dr. Dre and their motivations are <i>exactly</i> the same. Money... Good.",1403239019
7919539,comment,7919394,7919523,3,0,chatmasta,,,"I am perfectly okay with taking people&#x27;s money. In fact, in the past I managed $20,000 of monthly recurring revenue. In that case, it was set to auto bill. However, I found that many customers, rather than coming to the site or emailing support to cancel, would simply submit a chargeback on their credit card. Obviously that did not stop recurring billing, so then they would submit another chargeback the next month. Sometimes this was compounded by the fact the credit card was also stolen.<p>The problem was likely due to cancellation requiring an email to support, rather than a way to do it on the site. That business was selling proxies to SEO people. I eventually let it whither because 1) I was not happy with my customer base&#x27;s use of the product, and 2) chargebacks got out of control due to the above fact, combined with fraud. At one point it had a chargeback rate of 14%, and close to half of those were stolen credit cards.

The robotics program I started runs entirely off of volunteers, most of whom I&#x27;ve never met before their first day and certainly aren&#x27;t robotic specialists.  About 40 4th graders from 3 schools get ~40 hours of free robotics classes every year.  Not bad for a bunch of unpaid volunteers. To be clear, the robotics program wouldn&#x27;t exist without us, and everyone--the kids, parents, school--are all very happy we do it.<p>New York Cares is a non-profit that organizes volunteers for all sorts of community organizations. Knitting at senior centers, arts and crafts at transitional housing centers, cooking programs at rec centers.  Again, the programs wouldn&#x27;t exist without the volunteers, and the intended recipients definitely enjoy them and benefit.<p>The robotics program was recently written about in a Brooklyn local paper: <a href=""http://www.homereporternews.com/news/school_news/sunset-spark-robotics-class-sparks-kids-imaginations/article_0d188258-f273-11e3-9eea-0019bb2963f4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homereporternews.com/news/school_news/sunset-spar...</a>",1403238348

One of the most interesting studies (unrelated to the topic) had to deal with individuals looking into a mirror after failing a task. Individuals with >= slight depression would look themselves in the eyes, while happily ignorant individuals would avoid eye contact with themselves. They attributed this with a depressed person's desire to figure out what is wrong with themselves and internalize the failure, where as the happy people would avoid internalizing the failure.",1364950712

He is simply ignorant of the effect of his actions. He literally knows no other ways to relate.<p>Calling him names makes us no different from him, or the people who encouraged his social isolation.

5483379,comment,5482081,5482081,14,0,haberman,,,"I have a lot of respect for Kenton and I'm sure this is high quality work.<p>The idea of a fixed-length encoding of a protobuf-like structure is a good idea, and something I have seen explored elsewhere.  To me, though, it's unfortunate to create an entirely new schema language for it, instead of just making it an alternate encoding of the existing protobuf data model, which it closely resembles.  To have two schema languages that are nearly, but not quite, isomorphic means that you get no interoperability benefits with any existing protobuf-based code or data.<p>The way I see it, the most important feature of protobufs is <i>not</i> the on-the-wire encoding, but rather the schema.  If you start from a schema (and its associated data model), then you can create as many different encodings as you want, and convert between them losslessly at any time, while taking advantage of their different performance characteristics.<p>For example, Dremel (as described in this paper: <a href=""http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html</a>) is an extremely fast SQL-based query engine at Google, which powers the Google cloud product BigQuery (which I work on).  Because Dremel uses Protocol Buffers as its data model, any set of Protocol Buffers can be dumped into Dremel for fast querying, <i>without any kind of data massaging or converting step.</i>  I think this is a really powerful idea.<p>I can see reasons why Kenton might have chosen not to use .proto schemas directly, but I hope that they can eventually converge, because having a shared schema language is a powerful idea.",1364950070

Here's why: In my reading, this person was not confronted about it enough for him to change his behavior. In the author's writing, it was swept under the rug.<p>Right now resolution of these incidents goes like this:<p><pre><code>    Hear ugly -> politely ignore in person -> report to others
</code></pre>
So yeah, if you want to be deferential to other people and never get things accomplished by yourself, and passive aggressively ""send a message"" to the person by getting them banned by GDC, by all means. Just know that nothing will change. The person will resent you for getting him banned from GDC, not for being offended at his ugliness.<p>This is like calling the police because someone shouted in your face and you can't handle it. The correct answer is handling it yourself. The police don't have time for that shit, and I've seen way too many people think that's what the police are for (even calling 911 because someone was shouting at them, or laid a hand on them -- though the latter gets a little more complicated). Here's how this sort of thing <i>should</i> go:<p><pre><code>    Hear ugly -> stop socializing and make offender cry
</code></pre>
Seriously, a step by step guide to handling this:<p><pre><code>    1. Someone says something ugly.
    2. ""Whoa whoa, everybody stop. Shut up a second.""
    3. ""What did you just say?""
    4. Continue silencing the table.
       Do not let anybody else stop you or get involved.
    5. ""That is completely unacceptable.""
    6. ""You owe your victim an apology.""
       Do not stop until you get an honest one.
    7. If the offender whimpers, good. You got through.
    8. If the offender refuses apology, eject the offender.
</code></pre>
Think of this as garbage collection. Pause the world, clean up the garbage, resume socializing. It's important that everybody else defers to you and doesn't attempt to interrupt you or stop you. Several people always will to avoid the confrontation happening in front of them. ""I'm sure he didn't mean it <i>that</i> way."" Neutralize them or you will never be able to get through to the person you need to change. The target of your confrontation will cling to the people around you who are less sure of what you're doing and use it against you. Be resolute. This isn't ""alpha male"" behavior, this is standing strong and not taking no for an answer.<p>Seriously, be the change you want to see in our industry. Quit calling the cops to make other people fix your problems. Stop being polite to assholes. Your politeness is what feeds them -- they know you won't confront them.",1364949710

Jeff has just sold Punchfork and most likely has legal obligations prohibiting him from talking about too much, plus he's busy transitioning the company into a new parent organization, along with whatever else he has going on in his life.  They don't provide context, or email him with more information.  They tell Jeff to DM them if he wants to talk, as if this now puts the ball in Jeff's court.<p>Jeff politely responds: ""I'm sorry I can't right now.""  Nothing hostile here.<p>Then, OP posts a page about Hugspoon.  They intend to scrape and replicate Punchfork's data, in particular its user data.  Keep in mind, Jeff's site generated traffic for the sites he scraped, much like Google does.  By not showing full recipes, Jeff has become a discovery tool for those sites, not a competitor.  Hugspoon will not be providing value to Punchfork, the site it scrapes, or Pinterest, the site that now owns it.  Hugspoon competes with Punchfork by stealing its data and giving no value in return.  OP's claim that they're doing it for the users doesn't really matter.  They are stealing this data and it is not an apples to apples comparison to say that Punchfork also scraped data, because it provided significant value to the companies whose data it shared.  Ask any of those sites if they minded.<p>Jeff asks the OP if they are cloning his site and scraping all of the data.  He says it's extremely uncool if so.  So far, not hostile.  He has turned down a context-less request to chat with someone, and has now very level-headedly responded to a blatant attempt to clone his site and steal his data, competing with his new parent company and him for the same users.<p>Cameron Koczon does not answer the question.  He evades it and says, ""not trying to do anything uncool.  Still super eager to talk more.  Happy to do so anytime.""<p>Let me translate this last part for you.  ""We have stated publicly we plan to scrape your data.  We'll say we're not doing anything uncool, but that's because we think ""liberating"" your site's data is cool.  The ball is in your court to contact us, because you owe us that.  Just so you know, we can't wait to chat with you!""<p>Jeff responds.  ""Please do not scrape any data from PF for your product.  I'm asking you unequivocally and in public.  OK?""<p>Yet again, I see absolutely nothing hostile on Jeff's part so far.  In fact, if someone insisted <i>I contact them</i> in order to find out more about what they want to talk to me about, and then posted a note saying they intend to pull all of my data, I'd say asking for clarification and a confirmation that they are <i>not</i> going to do that is pretty fucking cordial.<p>Then Cameron says he will email Jeff in the AM.  Four days later, Jeff has to ask if he's going to get an email about this clone site that the OP has publicly announced.  Cameron responds that he ""ran out of steam"" and was away for the weekend.  Apparently, him being busy is a perfectly good excuse to leave a big issue out in the open un-addressed, but Jeff being busy isn't enough of a reason to send the guy more context about your plans in an email before announcing publicly your bullshit intentions to rip his site off.<p>And now there is the article on Fictive Kin, which could not be more ironically headed with the tagline ""Work Hard. Be Nice."" by people who are going to scrape all of the data they want from a single site, while bullying the site's owner into dealing with them in the way that they expect him to.  The post criticizes Jeff's acquisition announcement as callous, an opinion of theirs that I didn't share when I got the same notification.  I use Punchfork all of the time.  They criticize the ""ominous shutdown banner"", which I imagine was intended to alert users about the site's imminent closing.  Had he not posted such a banner, they would have said he didn't take enough action to alert users to the site's future.  Then, they take their arrogant opinion of the situation and paraphrase Jeff, saying: Were excited to share the news that were gonna be rich! To celebrate, were shutting down the site and taking all your data down with it. So long, suckers!<p>And as for Archive Team.  I assume you're talking about the guys that announced their own intentions by saying ""Injecting terabytes of Punchfork user/recipe data into <a href=""http://archive.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.org</a> .

Explain to me how these aren't a bunch of bitter dicks that saw a site get acquired, didn't like another company getting bought and absorbed, and decided to steal all of its data and compete with it, pausing only briefly to insist that the owner of that site give them a call because they would like to tell him to his face about their arrogance.  Explain to me why Jeff's request to ""Please don't copy any Punchfork data"" is a hostile response to being called an asshole.<p>I don't know a single level headed person who would look at this communication outside of the context of Fictive Kin's ridiculous blog post and not think that these are some of the biggest douchebags on the internet.",1364948997

I missed my tech bingo interviews (and I've had a lot of them), for reasons worthy of a blog post.  My first, for instance, with MS, went wrong because Alaska Airlines got my flight in around 1 or 2 AM - for an 8 AM interview the next day.  I know I was not at my best.<p>I am also totally done with Google - it's just not worth 4 months of runaround and countless phone interviews just to come in and fail because one of the interviewers hates the whole process.   And last time they contacted me, they told me to learn either Java or Python and call them back when I did.  No thanks.  Nothing against Python, but I am not putting that much effort into the chance at another interview.  I would totally work for a company that did Python, and learn as I go - I've done that plenty before.  (Edit: Oh, and the number of interviews google puts you through just should not be allowed)<p>I spent a year working on my own startup, which is what got me into rails, but it ran out of runway and I was then tied to the area by romance, and got a mediocre job at a huge company.  I am no longer encumbered, but my resume lacks any recognizable names (of schools or companies).  I've had a lot of other personal projects that never went anywhere and which earn me no points, but at least keep me in the game.  (I should have put them all on GitHub, I suppose, but was too embarassed about their unfinished nature to do so).<p>I also don't get what the obsession is with CS 201 questions.

(Though it may be that such a thing isn't novel and non-obvious, e.g. because aircraft do something similar or identical, so presuming no such thing was in the prior art.)<p>But software patents are still a problem. A self-driving car isn't a simple thing. The reason the engineering is hard is that you have to get a thousand things working together correctly. None of them individually is the key to making it work; all of them together are. And a software patent that claimed them all together would be useless because anyone could reinvent a minimum threshold of constituent parts and avoid infringement. So instead they claim each of the individual components in separate patents. Which leads to the general problem with software patents, which is that you multiply even a small possibility of independent invention by many thousands of patents and you effectively guarantee unintentional infringement by anyone trying to reach the same goal, which locks newcomers out of the market unless they can survive the costs of patent litigation.<p>Maybe you can solve this if you can find a way to separate the wheat from the chaff and stop issuing 98% of the software patents that are currently issued, but that seems to be much easier said than done. If it isn't possible or practical to do that then allowing 98% bad patents for the sake of 2% good ones is a pretty bad trade off.",1364948743

Your version requires it to be an array, and nothing else.  You may retort that it almost always is an array.  My experience in languages that support the abstraction disagrees with you.<p>Secondly with your version I find that I require significantly more typing, and get it wrong significantly more wrong simply because I had a trivial typo.<p>Thirdly with your version on a double loop I find myself periodically messing up because I slip in the wrong counter variable in the wrong place.  Stupid error, but the code compiles and does the wrong thing, then I have to track it down.  With the functional version I pretty much never make that mistake on that use case.<p>And finally my experience, with my background, says that it is easier to fix mistakes in the functional version than the explicit one.<p>The result is that separating the concept of iteration from the implementation is a good thing.

Since Cap'n Proto messages tend to be arena-allocated, dynamically growing space can be problematic.  Currently, for lists, you must specify the list size before filling in the data.  That could be improved in a few ways, but maps will likely be harder.<p>If you do know sizes in advance, I think hashtables make the most sense.  If we want something that allows dynamic additions and maybe even removals (and can figure out how to reconcile that with arena allocation), B-trees might be a really nice approach.  Maybe you could even use a huge mmap'd Cap'n Proto file as a database (warning: very speculative, lots of obstacles to resolve).",1364947300

A handful of remaining friends and I made a journey out to JapanTown and we had an amazing meal. It was a great way to end the trip.<p>One of my friends, and a fellow game developer, was there for dinner.  Her trip to GDC was planned last-minute, thanks to someone obtaining her a (very expensive!) all-access pass.<p>When recounting this chain of events, a male game developer at the table said that she only got the GDC pass because of her tits.<p>The table largely responded with aghast looks and silence. It was brought up that perhaps her ticket was thanks to being an award-winning game developer.<p>The same male responded with the ever-classy sure, award winning tits.<p>Defenses and arguments tried to be brought up, but conversation quickly moved on with the men talking over the woman until she just sat there quietly and resigned.<p>Im posting about this because this shit has to stop.<p>Im posting about this because I was silent when I should have spoken up. I shouldnt have let the conversation sweep this transgression under the rug.<p>Im posting this because I am tired of being made complicit (due to inaction) when these things happen. Im tired of having to yell at people for this shit every night at GDC. Im tired because I want this to end, and Im tired of having this conversation over and over again.<p>Im tired of feeling like shit because I dont have enough energy to defend my friends every fucking DAY.<p>Im terrified of losing friends over this.<p>Im not a very confrontational person. Usually I deal with shit like this by making a mental note to avoid the person in the future. And now that my friends feelings are hurt and people are accusing me of inaction and being a bad person because of it, I feel like my last few years of championing anti-harassment policies (and ENFORCING them) doesnt even matter.<p>It sucks that my entire personality can be judged on my last exchange.<p>So, hey: if you are a sexist ass around me, and think its just ironic meta-humour, know that its hurting me. It hurts me for days, weeks, months afterwards. It hurts my friends. It hurts my business. It makes me less creative, it makes me want to just hide in my basement all day. It makes me not want to go to GDC again.<p>If I dont tell this to your face its probably because Im tired of having this exchange this week. It makes me feel angry, upset, and sad.

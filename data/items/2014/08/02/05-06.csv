It&#x27;s a 2 out of 3 address, which means that two signatures are required to move the funds further. The good thing about it is that you can totally skip the escrow party here if buyer and seller agree - they both just sign the transaction and send it to the network. Escrow is needed only in case of a conflict - he would have then to investigate and sign a transaction with either buyer to refund the Bitcoins or to seller to forward them to him as contract described (in a case that buyer disappears for some reason).<p>This setup has one downside though - if one party sides with the escrow, they could agree to sign a transaction to scam the other party. That&#x27;s why it is not 100% bulletproof and you have to carefully select your escrow partner so that both parties trust him to an extent.",1406958539

Also if there was some way to integrate with netflix and filter out all the movies I have already seen from my watched list. There should be a third party provider that keeps track of watched movies/tv shows and your ratings for them that could provide an api to the likes of netflix and anyone else that wanted it. The problem with sites like this is like 95% of the results fall into the category of I have seen it or I already know about it and don&#x27;t want to see it.

8124068,comment,8123880,8123880,3,0,mindcrime,,,"Heh... I just realized I have no idea what any other Triangle area startups are building in. And more to the point, I don&#x27;t really care.  I mean, if I met another startup founder at an event or something, the question &quot;what is your tech stack?&quot; would be pretty near the bottom of the list of things I&#x27;d ask.  I actually can&#x27;t even think of a reason I&#x27;d <i>want</i> to know.<p>I&#x27;ll go back to what Steve Blank and others have said:  most startups that fail (and most do), fail because they build a product nobody wants, not because of technical problems with the product.  If you believe that is true (and I do), the tech stack really just isn&#x27;t a very important decision at all. And I think that&#x27;s especially true if you stick to anything even remotely close to mainstream: Node, Rails, Grails, Django, Flask/Pyramid/Pylons/Whatever-it&#x27;s-called-now, Scala+Play, Java+Spring MVC, Whatever-Clojure-uses, etc.<p>Now, if you said you were building using Algol-68, SNOBOL, RPG/400 or MUMPS, then there might be a legitimate question regarding your ability to find and hire good developers, etc.  But I&#x27;d still almost be willing to bet that &quot;building a product nobody wants&quot; would be more likely to be the culprit if the company failed, than the tech choice.<p>That said, we use Groovy and Grails here.  Node is on my list of &quot;things to play around with when I have some free time&quot; but nothing I&#x27;ve heard yet gives me any reason to think that it&#x27;s a &quot;game changer&quot;.

It&#x27;s literally flapping your hands in ... anticipation? excitement? sensory overload?  I don&#x27;t know, but I think my son does.<p>> Please ... consider what &quot;normal&quot; means and what its worth might be.<p>Yes, I put &quot;normal&quot; in quotes for a reason as I don&#x27;t particularly care too much about &quot;normal.&quot;  For me and my son &quot;happy&quot; is more important than normal for the most part.  But, there is a <i>huge</i> issue.  I chose to have children later in life (I&#x27;m 43 right now and my son is 3).  So there is pressure on me and my family to make sure that whatever happens that my son is cared for and kept happy.<p>I can&#x27;t guarantee that I can ensure he&#x27;s financially taken care of after I&#x27;m gone.  I <i>hope</i> that issue is far down the road and I hope it won&#x27;t be an issue, <i>but</i> what if it is?  Do I work on helping him to become &quot;normal&quot;?  Or do I <i>hope</i> that I can provide for him <i>no matter what</i>?<p>So do I make the decision at all costs to make sure he&#x27;s provided for by becoming &quot;normal&quot; or do I dash that to the wind and hope I make enough money to provide for him when I&#x27;m gone, but keep him happy?<p>There is a good reason to making sure that he can be productive in society at the cost of losing himself (if that&#x27;s possible, no one knows that it is) vs. keeping who he is at all costs.  Does that make sense?<p>I hope it&#x27;s clear that I love him for who he is no matter what, but that I want to make sure that he has a &quot;good&quot; life for the rest of his life.

8430586,comment,8430520,8430520,0,0,mindcrime,,,"I think you&#x27;re over-thinking this.  I mean, yeah, the point about how (some) people in their 30&#x27;s (or later) have dramatically different life circumstances (family, mortgage, etc.) is true.  Other than that, I don&#x27;t think it matters much.<p>Is a failed 30 year old founder viewed differently than a 20 year old one? I don&#x27;t know, but I doubt it, and - more to the point - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s relevant.  Speaking as a 41 year old founder, I know that I don&#x27;t give two flying fucks what anybody else will think about me if we ultimately fail.  I mean, why would I? Why would you?  Why would anybody?  &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the sum of the law&quot; and all that.  Don&#x27;t worry about seeking approval from strangers, life is too short for that shit.<p><i>Since job prospects are changing way too fast , how difficult it becomes to get job in 30s after failed start-up especially if you have family?</i><p>This is debatable, but my experience has been that if you have &quot;in demand&quot; skills and are good at what you do, finding a job isn&#x27;t difficult even into your 40&#x27;s - at least for a developer or other tech role.  Maybe it&#x27;s different for other fields, I really can&#x27;t say.  What I can say is that at least here on the East Coast, I&#x27;ve observed plenty of older developers (even more than a few who are quite older than me) who had no issues with age discrimination or whatever, so long as they had current skills.<p>My overall take?  I look at working on a startup as a chance to learn new skills, broaden my horizons and learn a ton of valuable lessons. IF Fogbeam fails someday, I believe the experience will have made me far more employable, not less so.  YMMV. <i>shrug</i>",1412823551

8430584,comment,8430520,8430520,0,0,Jun8,,,"Going to Startup School this weekend and getting ready for a YC submission, a similar question is <i>very</i> much on my mind, the only difference is that rather than early 30s I&#x27;m in my 40s! I think that the age related difficulty factors you cite increase exponentially with age.<p>The real problem is not a failed startup but finding out in 1-2 years that you&#x27;re really not cut out for this type of life, due to many factors, some of which you listed.<p>Starting startups in your 20s and even in 30s is a no brainer: even if you want to go back to the corporate world in 3-5 years you still have many years assuming a cut off competitive employment age of around, say 55 (not the same thing as retirement); yet, if you&#x27;re in your 40s you&#x27;re getting dangerously close to the age where it becomes difficult to apply to large companies. The remaining options become starting another startup and freelancing. This means that an important lifeline that&#x27;s available to young founders is not there for such older founders.",1412823532

I don&#x27;t know exact financial conditions of anyone , however I would venture a guess that at least 60 % HN visitors and posters live moderately , work very hard and passionate about technology. Few are already working tech startups and many dream to start their own one day.
So what about founders who have not yet started their company and are in early 30s ? 
Statistically this decade of 30 to 40 is life comes at interesting phase. Many get married , have kids, start saving all they could towards retirement , parents start get old ( assuming you were born in their 30s ) and having family means you have to try hard to make time for your spouse. 
Mental energy required for running startup certainly creates enormous stress.<p>So what happens when such startup with founders in 30s fail ? Does society viewed them as ineptitude ? Since job prospects are changing way too fast , how difficult it becomes to get job in 30s after failed start-up especially if you have family ?<p>What do you think ? Do you think working on startup in 30s is okay and not been out of mind ?

Individual nations will then need to decide if their citizens have a right to real privacy, or just the right to be lied to about privacy. Multinational corporations have some flexibility in terms of where and how they do business, but they have to acquiesce to whatever local laws apply in the countries where they operate -  with their own statement of ethics being some kind of baseline, hopefully. One protection afforded companies based in say, the EU, is that they&#x27;re under less obligation to backdoor their products under threat of the US et al. That gives them a better position of trust with the EU market base. Of course, their products destined for the US market may well be customised to accommodate CALEA etc. Open source projects and foundations on the other hand operate practically outside the purview of traditional government, it seems.

Survival of the fittest for a virus usually means allowing the host to live longer - in other words LESS lethal.<p>Lethality is irrelevant to a virus, all that matters is the probability of transmission. Ebola is about as rapidly deadly as a virus can be and still be viable. The selection pressure is all on shedding large numbers of virus particle in all directions - there is no selection pressure on preventing you from dying.<p>So why does Ebola kill then? It is basically a side effect of its mechanisms of transmission. It diverts your body into producing an enormous number of viral particles and then makes your body “leaky” so that they are released into the environment to infect someone else. If you were to design a virus based on Ebola from scratch for maximum transmission in humans you would slow down the disease progression, but you would find it hard to remove the lethality.<p>Another way of thinking about Ebola is that the current strain is not at the local maximum for optimal transmission in humans as it kills too quickly. Any slow down in disease progression will cause the infectiousness in humans to increase. This is why this is something we should be worried about.",1412821453

Americans claim they are first humans walked on the Moon. Is it provable? Did they monitor the Moon all the time it&#x27;s exists? May be there was another civilization of humans which waked all over the Moon centures ago? 
Did Columbus discovered America? - there were people living on the land! etc. 
It is all relative, sure.",1412820798

Well I&#x27;ve listed specific reasons as to why it&#x27;s not as good as the way things are in the West.<p>Your current example about 100 replies to your post is like the number of projects on csdn.net; it&#x27;s just not impressive like other things in China like the pace and scope of Chinese construction (e.g. the 3 Gorges dam) or China&#x27;s ambition for manned moon landings... and again it has nothing to do with skill or talent.

We need to build a GPU compute box (thinking GeForce GTX Titan Black[$1000] as the GPU) for training Convolutional Neural Networks and building services on top of the trained model. What would be the most cost effective way to colo such a server?
Hurricane Electric told us a 2U rack space (100mbit and 750W) would cost us $700/month and I find that a little too expensive.(they are saying that we would rent a whole cabinet for the same price since their main cost is going to be our power usage and not bandwidth etc)<p>I am also thinking of building the box on my own and putting it in our office in SF (which has a static ip and 50mbit unlimited internet) but that&#x27;d probably violate the TOS - and even if it doesn&#x27;t I am not sure if the internet connection would be stable enough to operate such a service from (though it doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to be real-real-time -- we just the box to consume our job queue and a 1 minute delay would be acceptable there)<p>What are your thoughts on this? Do we really have to come to terms with having to pay $700+/mo for this?<p>(somehow arranging this for ~$300/mo would be amazing)",1412820387

Then they buy one tractor for $50k, pay off the corresponding govt official, and keep the difference. And I&#x27;m not making this up. They recently tried to arrest 2 or 3 guys on this (they probably didn&#x27;t pay enough) and they just fled to Miami and Panama.<p>If you come to venezuela, bring dollars.

American Society has a group of people (I'm going to say age 35 and below) who had never lived through a significant downturn before this.  So sites like this aren't necessarily saying ""Detroit is a lost cause"" they are marveling at the idea of abandon buildings which is a fairly new concept to a lot of us.<p>I, for example, grew up in Las Vegas and am endlessly fascinated by the Fontainebleu building (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontainebleau_Resort_Las_Vegas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontainebleau_Resort_Las_Vegas</a>).

2868768,comment,2867684,2868632,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"<i>I define inflation as simply being 'when the government prints more money'.</i><p>I would posit that this definition is useless in a fiat currency. Under a gold standard, the government printing money was relevant because that increased the amount of money, which in turn had some meaning because of the gold-to-money ratio. But in a fiat currency no such meaning exists.<p>Furthermore, has whether the government printed more or less money actually ever affected you directly, provably in your personal life? I bet that it hasn't. [1] But I bet that the Consumer Price Index <i>does</i> affect your personal life. So CPI as measure for inflation is actually useful, unlike your definition.<p>Finally, it would be nice if you used clearer language to describe what you are talking about. I'm sure that it is obvious to you that the government literally printing money is completely irrelevant. But your use of such language makes it hard for me to understand what you are <i>actually</i> talking about (I just appreciate a clear conversation on the matter).<p>Are you talking about the government <i>spending</i> more money? Clearly you can't be saying that government spending is always inflationary, can you? And if you did, I hope you'd at least acknowledge that it's just the <i>spending</i> part that matters, i.e. it is irrelevant whether we're talking about government, foreign, or private spending.<p>Are you talking about the Fed increasing the size of the Monetary Base, as happened with Quantitative Easing? In that case, hasn't that QE/QE2 demonstrated clearly enough to you that there is no causal link from the MB to Consumer Price Indices?<p>Are you talking about the government increasing the amount of money in terms of M1-M3? In that case, you'd be woefully misinformed, since that amount largely depends on bank lending, and so the government has basically no direct influence over it.<p>Are you talking about something else that I've missed?<p><i>I wasn't talking about the UK specifically. I was just trying to say that, in general, I think the outcome in terms of social unrest is going to be about the same whether you reduce the amount of money you give people or whether you give them money that is worth less.</i><p>There is actually an interesting technical argument against that stance that dates back to the days of Keynes. Basically, what progressive economists were (and still are) arguing is that for most people, X% inflation is better than an X% decrease in income. The reason is that most people have long-running contracts forcing them to pay nominally fixed amounts, such as rents or mortgages.<p>Here's an illustrating computation with very simple numbers. Say I earn 1000# per month, of which 500# are committed to such contracts. 500# are available for ""discretionary"" spending (food, clothes, etc.). I now have the choice between 10% inflation and a 10% reduction in income.<p>In the case of 10% inflation, I still have 500# available for discretionary spending, only it's worth the equivalent of 450# of the old money.<p>In the case of 10% reduction in income, I earn 900# with my contractual commitments remaining the same, so I only have 400# left for discretionary spending.<p>Clearly, inflation is better for me. The situation is different for people with significant net financial assets of course, but the majority of the population does not fall into that category.<p>[1] Unless by <i>printing</i> money you mean <i>spending</i> money and you are a government contractor.",1312991544

2868645,comment,2868296,2868296,1,0,dkokelley,,,"I don't buy it (as a backup philosophy). For starters, there is a difference between wanting to replace your data in the event of a drive failure, and wanting your descendants 1,000 years from now to be able to read your data.<p>In the former case, there is nothing special about the 1,000 lifespan, and on a $/GB level, you would do better to use an online backup or redundant drive solution. Let's assume that in 10 years your drive will fail and you need 1TB of data restored. You would need 218 of these disks (or $1,526 worth of the backup medium). Given the same 10 years, an online solution like Carbonite runs $60/year, or $600 for ""unlimited"" data over 10 years. Granted, on year 11 you lose all of that data unless you keep paying, but there are other benefits like continual backups (whereas this disk is permanently written with 10 year old data, while the online system backed up your photos from last weekend). Assuming you don't want your data in someone else's hands, let's assume you want to store your data on a local hard drive. Of course you're smart and cautious, so you have a raid backup drive. 1TB external drives run for $160. Let's assume a life span of 5 years on average (I've seen better, and I've seen worse). Not counting the original data on your computer's internal drive, you would need 4 drives to cover 10 years (2 drive in a raid configuration, given 5 year's lifespan). This will cost you $640.<p>However you slice the near-term backup, I can't see the benefits of a permaDVD.<p>For long-term, archival purposes, this system might make more sense. I'm not sure what other systems are out there that can estimate a 1,000 year lifespan (at $1.50/GB). Then again, imagine trying to find a DVD player in 1,000 years.",1312989937

And then the companies sit on the good, if older, stuff and move it ever further up in the premium levels.  I'd actually watch ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", but it's been moved to price levels I won't pay for.

Not only that, since it's all on-demand, he can choose whatever fits his mood during the time he's allowed to watch stuff. And because the media is ""always available"", I think he's developing a kind of acceptance that it's okay to stop watching when he's bored because the content availability is not constrained to ""now."" In other words, it's far easier for him to leave a show midway when it's time for bed or something because he knows he can just pick it up later and continue some other day.

I'm certainly not smart enough to have one, and I don't think there's any easy solution. The government needs to prioritise critical services like the NHS (a whole other debate on whether it's actually doing that) as well as other core services. It's difficult to justify youth centres and programs if hospitals are dangerously underfunded, especially when there is no quantitative or conclusive evidence regarding their efficacy.

I assume they want each option to have only one solution. The last example (""It is poor form to ____ you temper in a discussion group""), either option (lose or loose) works. The verb form of 'loose' means 'to set free', and temper has come to mean an agitated state of mind. So you can say, ""It is poor form to lose (be deprived of) your temper (calm state of mind) in a discussion group.""<p>But you can also say, ""It is poor form to loose (let free from restraint) your temper (agitated state of mind) in a discussion group.""",1312988590

And he (according to my sources) is not a good social dancer.<p>The economics of Salsa are driven by the race to the bottom when someone starts giving away classes for free. Most salsa dancers don't drink that much so expecting the bar or club to earn significant revenue from dancers is not that possible (but it depends on whether you are attracting the girls' night out crowd or the serious dancers).<p>The real money is made in the wedding dance preparation market. It really plays to the competitive landscape of showing off and SYTYCD. The recession has hurt the market some but most upwardly mobile couples will drop $2k for a package of twenty private lessons aimed to get them to the very important first dance as a married couple with style, confidence, and choreographed moves.<p>That is the secret of dance studios. Wedding couples are their fat cow.<p>To make money off a salsa conference is an impressive accomplishment.",1312988523

Before we have some kind of numbers, I don&#x27;t think discussing this can lead anywhere constructive.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that most users of nicotine (as smoked tobacco or in electronic cigarettes) get physiologically addicted pretty quickly, and in a pretty hard way. Though this is inconvenient to them, it usually does not bother people around, because nicotine is not a behavior-altering substance (unlike alcohol or cocaine). AFAIK, heroin is not a behavior-altering substance either. It&#x27;s the <i>lack</i> of a dose what dangerously alters the behavior of a heroine addict (or an alcohol addict).<p>Since heroin is outlawed, users have far lower thresholds to pass to act unlawfully in other regards, since they feel like criminals already. A heavy nicotine addict may suffer immensely without a fix, but usually stays a lawful citizen despite it.<p>Take insulin: it&#x27;s also intended to be used as a drug, and improper use can quickly kill you. Thats why it&#x27;s a prescription-only substance, but a completely lawful one. Quite a few over-the-counter drugs can kill you, or at least severely cripple you, if used improperly.

But even if it works 99% of the time that&#x27;s still a lot of things going wrong, given the size of .NET. Microsoft&#x27;s tools and code aren&#x27;t perfect either but I find I have way less issues with them relative to Xamarin.)",1395108031

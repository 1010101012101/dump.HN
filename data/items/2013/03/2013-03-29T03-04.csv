5459189,comment,5455317,5455864,1,0,gee_totes,,,"I disagree. I don't think SE turns people off when questions are closed, or discourages people from asking another question. Sometimes, you'll see a closed question asked by the user who go their question closed come up in meta, and the user will receive very constructive feedback.<p>The SE community works very hard to keep things on topic. The questions that come up on Hacker News are very interesting, but often times fit the definitions of being off-topic or not constructive. I don't think their closure has had any effect on the frequency of those really interesting off-topic questions.<p>Also, imagine if SE allowed these types of questions. The community would be overrun by flame wars and turn more into a discussion board, not a place to get answers.<p>On the other hand, I don't think closing questions has a strong enough effect to discourage people from asking off-topic or otherwise poor questions (see the Programmers.SE board for an example). It's been going through Eternal September for a couple of years now. (I'm not going to give an example of, what is in my opinion, the best moderated SE board since I don't want it to get any exposure and suffer the same fate)<p>So in closing, there's rhyme and reason to SE closing questions, and I don't think it hurts the site.",1364529558

5459160,comment,5457168,5457743,11,0,DannyBee,,,"To address a few points:<p>I'm not sure why you think oddly shaped CFG's that have goto's would hurt it.
At worst, you can always turn oddly shaped CFG's into sanely shaped ones at the cost of code duplication.<p>Very early on in the days of the tree-ssa project, Sebastian actually implemented goto elimination for GCC.
It made zero performance difference in any real code (even those people building goto heavy interpreters).
So it was removed.<p>In any case, real, sparse, SSA based optimizations don't care about even fully connected CFG's (There are plenty in GCC's testsuite).  Yes, dataflow optimizations care, but if you aren't doing something sparsely, you should fix that. :)<p>As a complete aside:<p>I agree with the original poster that asm.js is a leaky abstraction, but disagree with everything else.  All sane optimizing compilers do lowering of some sort (i'm aware of V8's direct code generation, as well as Go's. At least Go's normal compiler doesn't make the claim that this generates amazing native code, only reasonable native code).  Even gcc has what is known as ""high gimple"", which looks like C, but is normalized a bit, and then ""gimple"", which looks like C, but is even more normalized.<p>(LLVM, by comparison, has something a lot less like C, but lately lots of metadata has been added to recover some of the losses)<p>All asm.js does is expose the ""GIMPLE"" level.
If the argument is ""it's not sane for folks to write asm.js instead of javascript (the equivalent to ""it's not sane for folks to write GIMPLE instead of C), this is kind of a truism.  To the degree asm.js folks think people should be <i>writing</i> asm.js formed code directly, they rightly deserve to be mocked :P.
(Generating it at runtime, of course, is a different thing altogether)<p>To the degree the original poster's argument is ""optimizing asm.js takes away the desire to optimize anything not asm.js"", this is well, wrong.  Performance benchmarks and apps are still written in normal JS.  Just because GCC/OdinMonkey has GIMPLE/asm.js doesn't mean they don't try to optimize regular C/javascript. The whole point of <i>having GIMPLE/asm.js</i> is to make it easier to optimize testcases by normalizing them so you can guarantee that if you perform this optimization, it will work as well no matter how crazy the actual original input code.<p>Yes, you can almost always extend everything to handled the unbounded set of the real language.  You can see ways to directly do better codegen from JS without an intermediate form.
In fact, there were for a long time, source to source optimizing C and C++ translators.<p>One of the reasons they basically all died is because they were 100x harder to maintain and improve than all of the standard ""high IR/mid IR/low IR"" arrangement of optimizing compilers, and over time, the optimizing compilers won.
By a large margin.
It wasn't even close.<p>Heck, GCC did very well for many years with no normalized version of the high level language: It used to go from AST to very low level IR and work on that.  Right up until about 1994, this worked well.
Then it started losing to compilers with a normalized high level IR (ICC, PGI, XLC, everyone). By factors of 2-10.<p>If the world was all still fortran, and we were using fortran in the browser, maybe the ""i don't see the need for asm.js"" would be a reasonable discussion.<p>With a language like javascript, it's not.",1364529018
5459159,comment,5457858,5457858,3,0,kamaal,,,"For those who already don't know about this, GTD is the best place to start on anything related this. Also start watching various talks by David Allen to get a total perspective of how this works.<p>And for those who want a quick heads up. Continue reading...<p>The crux of the issue is that the human brain is not good at storing thing like lists, or lists of lists or lists of lists of lists .. ad infinitum. The problem gets more complicated when you to manage these list structures in your brain. Its very difficult to do this to-do, done, priority and triaging etc activities in your brain itself. Chances are that, if you put all that stuff in your head you will- Either forget most of them and focus what you brain thinks is the highest priority(which most of the times disastrously ends up in a task called 'procrastination') or that your mind will spend great deals of time, energy and psychic resources to maintain those list structures. The net result is much resources are spent maintaining that list structures than executing them. This is when you get that overwhelming feeling of 'I am stressed' or 'There are too many things to do, I cant take it anymore' emotions.<p>What is the result?- you either mess up real badly forgetting things or get overwhelmed and give up.<p>There are a few exceptions to these cases. During the times of crisis/interesting-situations your brain does a superb job of prioritizing things and putting all the focus on one most important task at hand. This is the reason why when your life is in danger or when you start work on a very interesting project you brain automagically tells you to do tasks X, Y and Z without even you consciously knowing about it. A few more exceptions to this are moments of 'Flow', when you are in a moment of 'Flow'[1], when you experience flow you will not need a list set up to help you out. But you will need GTD to get into 'Flow'[2].<p>To summarize it all:<p><pre><code>    1. Your brain needs a purge from time to time.
    2. You need some way of maintaining task state outside
    your brain. My advice is use a diary and pen/pencils.
    3. You need to visualize things. Not just your schedule.
    I mean everything. Even if its a simple program you are
    writing, put it down on a paper first. Visualize it.
    4. I repeat. Purge your brain. Put things down on paper
    first.
    5. Make plans, break them down and execute.
    6. Pick interesting projects. Helps in getting into
    'Flow'.
    7. REVIEW THE PROGRESS OF YOUR PLANS(without this its 
    all useless)
    8. Ponder on the 'Next task' for every task you do.</code></pre>

There may be problems with O-levels/GCSEs and A-levels in the UK or their equivalents in other European countries, but proper exams - not just multiple choice tests that are little more than proxies for IQ testing - are a good starting point for understanding who has learned what and when.  Regrouping kids year by year to ensure that they're getting the best support for learning at the pace they're ready for is a lot easier when you have some standards.<p>A key problem is that pretty much ANY change is resisted.  If it's a change that emulates another country that does better than the US at education the knee jerk reaction is to explain why the American system is so much superior.  Yet we continue to fail to educate our kids, churning them out with little knowledge of the world, woeful critical thinking skills, and often lacking the curiosity necessary to seek out self-improvement on either front.<p>Edit:  One more thought that strikes me is the terrible state of tertiary education.  Colleges have byzantine admissions systems that favor nepotism and subjective criteria (partially no doubt a factor of no real exam system at 18 that you can base entry on).  Many of the top colleges have become - to steal someone else's rather nice phrase - hedge funds with schools attached for tax reasons.  They've taken all the money off the table - in that your lifetime expected earnings increase is now approximately equal to the fully costed amount you'll spend gaining the degree, in many cases.  That absolutely trickles down a negative impact on the younger levels of education - when things other than what you learn at elementary and high school level have the greatest impact your ability to gain benefit from the college cycle.<p>tl;dr I agree we should have ability streaming so long as there is a mechanism to rejig the streaming every year to make up for those surging ahead and help those falling behind where they were placed the year before",1364527120

Around 8th grade I got serious about tech and science and learning, but it was impossible to be advanced to the honors courses unless my parents were to raise a major stink which they were too modest to do.

Although I didn't like the grade skip (from fifth to seventh, which put me in a new school while my previous classmates were still in sixth grade at the elementary school), I did like being among classmates who in general were smarter than average. (I still had industrial arts classes and physical education classes with the general school population, and there was only one choir class.)<p>I hear that now that junior high schools are mostly called ""middle schools,"" there has been a strong middle school philosophy of having all classes for early adolescents be heterogeneously grouped. That doesn't sound like a good educational idea to me. I fully approve of the idea of young people learning to get along with people of all ability levels. I have good friends from my non-tracked elementary school classes whom I am catching up with recently after FORTY YEARS of not seeing one another. (Facebook has helped a lot with that reconnecting.) I have lifelong friends from the tracked classes after the grade skip too, including a childhood best friend after whom I named my oldest son.<p>Even more important than grouping by ability, methinks, is upping the curriculum standard for everybody. In Taiwan, where my wife grew up, the seventh grade mathematics curriculum includes a good bit of algebra and geometry for everybody--including all the below-average students. I didn't see algebra, even with a tracked math class, until eighth grade in Minnesota, and when my family moved to Wisconsin the next school year, the highest math class in ninth grade was studying the same beginning algebra class from the same textbook I had already had the year before. The countries with the best performance in primary schooling get it in large part by having specialist teachers in the core subjects in elementary school. United States elementary teachers are expected to be generalists, but in practice they devote a lot of time and effort being jacks of all trades but masters of none.<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>Let's do better for everybody in school.

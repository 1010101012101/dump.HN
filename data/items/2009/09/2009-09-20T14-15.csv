The important points:<p>There are two zinc compounds involved; some lozenges only have one.<p>Researchers think that the efficacy of the zinc is largely topical.  So, having a lozenge that dissolves slowly -- Cold Eeze are formulated as hard candy -- maximizes efficacy.<p>You need to start taking the lozenges <i>at the first sign</i> of symptoms.  This may be difficult for some.  For me, I can usually tell the difference between a cold and something else, like an allergic reaction.<p>Zinc is a short term boost.

You have to go into massive debt, on <i>top</i> of your potentially massive college debt, before you figure out that medicine or law can be a really miserable line of work.

833089,comment,832475,832475,0,0,obiefernandez,,,"The article glances over a lot. We pair-program on production code over 95% of the time. Driving duties alternate every few minutes or even seconds. Pingpong programming is common. It's all facilitated by having dual keyboards and mice hooked up to the workstation. Occasionally the pair splits up virtually. Each half of the pair has their MBP sitting there on the desk next to the 30"" shared workstation monitor. If the driver is taking care of a mindless task (just typing) then the non-driver can switch their attention to their own screen for whatever, but still be aware of what the driver is doing. Examples of windows you have open on your MBP while pairing are: Harvest for details time-tracking, Campfire to communicate with stakeholders and other devs, pivotaltracker to refer to story details, API references, etc.<p>On the people front, we do our best to only hire experienced devs that will like the culture and fit in. We're a boutique shop, so we can be very picky about who we hire. Candidates have to pair with us onsite for at least a week before the team decides whether to hire. We've hired qualified interns, but don't hire apprentice or junior-level folks. Occasionally we do extended pairing matchups with client developers in our office, but they have to fit in culturally for it to work.<p>I think pairing all the time is one of our most important competitive advantages. My teams produce some of the highest-quality code I've ever seen in 15 years in the biz. We are able to effectively leverage XP-style client acceptance in our process because our code is so defect-free.<p>I'm proud of what we've created at Hashrocket, but usually try to stress the importance of context and talent in making it work. Pairing all the time is one of those things where I have to advise Agile idealists that it probably won't work for them. :(",1253457722

833073,comment,832933,832979,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's the fascinating history of branding. Apple invented the PC, but they poured their energy into selling the brand <i>Apple</i> rather than the term <i>PC</i>. IBM then came along with a machine <i>called</i> ""the IBM PC"", which sold a lot of units and was the subject of a lot of marketing. With the word <i>PC</i> as the actual name of the machine, the tendency to associate that term exclusively with IBM machines began.<p>(As I recall, the generic term for a non-IBM PC tended to be ""microcomputer"" or ""micro"" rather than ""PC"".)<p>That trend then leapt forward when Compaq started making PC clones. The clonemakers needed a word for what they were making. There was a time when you could call them ""IBM compatibles"", ""PC compatibles"", or ""PC clones"", but once IBM switched to PS/2 and OS/2 -- and proceeded to fade from dominance -- continuing to associate the word <i>IBM</i> with these things made little sense. Meanwhile, Apple wasn't trying to contest the term <i>PC</i>... instead they invented their own exclusive brand name, <i>Macintosh</i>, and sold the hell out of that.<p>So in the end the word <i>PC</i> ended up meaning <i>a generic Intel box that runs Microsoft Windows or Linux</i>.",1253456542

Assuming the absolute worst of the nuclear winter hypotheses to be true, we could perhaps destroy most of the higher life on Earth. But even after a nuclear winter the Earth would still have substantial amounts of water and oxygen, and almost certainly a functioning biosphere of some sort. [1] Which is more than can be said for the Moon or even Mars.
Meanwhile, we most certainly don't have the technology to reach an extrasolar Earth-like planet, and spending tens of billions of dollars to have humans dork around in near-solar orbit won't change that fact one bit. If you really do dream of settling other planets, you need to spend far fewer dollars on far more radical experiments. Or you need to read Charles Stross:

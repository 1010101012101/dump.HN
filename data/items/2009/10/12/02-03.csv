Anyway, the days were long and boring so I took the time to devise a way to get free sodas out of the vending machine.  I was not interested in stealing soda, as I hated it, but only in figuring out how to do so.  I eventually did so.  I was so proud of myself that I decided to show one of the guys that I got along with pretty well.  When I came back few days later the machine was completely empty and was never again able to provide tasty beverages for very long. Eventually the owner of the machine caught on and removed it from our site.  I was very naive.",1255316288

This constitutes n(n-1)/2 handshakes: each person shakes hands with every other person. The number is divided by two to account for double-counting the handshakes.<p>The sum of handshakes can alternatively be computed by summing the number of unique handshakes made by each person: person 1 shakes n-1 hands, person 2 shakes n-2 hands (for he has already shaken hands with the first person), and so forth, until person n-1 shakes only one hand: person n has already shaken hands with everyone else. This can be expressed as: n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + ... + 1, or, through the commutative property of addition, 1 + 2 + .. + n-2 + n-1. This is conveniently expressed as the summation (i=1,i->n-1,i).<p>We know that the summation (i=1,i->n-1,i) is equivalent to the expression n(n-1)/2.

I don't think Murdoch is actually upset that Google drives people to his sites, what bugs him is that they go to Google first.<p>When you read a story in a newspaper, you almost automatically consume other content in that paper, including ads. Why pick up another paper to read more news when it's already in your hands? To a lesser extent the same is true for cable news, you watch a brief segment and you are bombarded with ""coming up next"" teasers and flashy graphics, pretty anchors, etc., all designed to keep you on that channel (watching ads).<p>The web is way less sticky than even television, sure you could flip channels but you lose context, and you might have to keep flipping to find something interesting, broadcast is a push medium. Contrast this with the web page: what is the easiest thing to do after reading the linked story? Search around the new site (that you may not be familiar with) or hit the back button and resume what you were doing: Pulling down stories you want to read, instead of waiting to see if something interesting comes up.<p>I think Murdoch gets the power of the aggregator, I don't think he understands that he has always pushed content to consumers. (Yes a lot of work goes into creating a brand that attracts these consumers to the paper/network but once they are there they have content pushed to them.)

The fact that car mechanics make more than programmers points to the fact that there is actually a dearth of education leading up to being a capable mechanic, and perhaps a surfeit of education leading up to being a mediocre programmer.  The fact that manufacturing has been shedding jobs for decades makes it even weirder that competence in the manual trades is so expensive to hire.  Perhaps America has never provided decent educational support for the trades, and for a long time, the average manufacturing job required little.

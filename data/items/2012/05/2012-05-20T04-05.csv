3997984,comment,3997647,3997647,3,0,SeoxyS,,,"This situation is most commonly encountered on iOS, with ad networks and SBJson.<p>As the developer behind one of the ad network SDKs included in countless iOS apps, I struggled finding a good solution to this problem. Spoiler: there isn't one.<p>The good news is, while there were often collisions on SBJson; pretty much all versions of the version are compatible. For a while, we would compile our static library without the SBJson objects, and ship the library and SBJson separately.<p>Recently we decided to create our own fork of SBJson, and switch to using our own prefix, which allowed us to embed it in our library, and not worry about what other libraries were doing.<p>Note: another tricky gotcha with static libraries for iOS: There is a bug in the linker, in that it will not import Objective-C categories from `.o` files unless there is another another symbol that is recognized, such as a class of C function. This has caused crashers and much headache.",1337489816

3997974,comment,3995185,3996209,1,0,kragen,,,"Aside from the things described by the other commenters, a big thing they're doing is accepting major performance hits that are no longer relevant. xterm on this netbook renders text onto the screen by copying prerendered glyph rectangles loaded by the X server from PCF files into the framebuffer, because that's how you had to do it in 1984, because you were on a barely-1-MIPS workstation, and if you tried to do something fancier at the time (including masked copies, so you don't need to have a character in your font for , but can overstrike a   and an a) xterm would have displayed text noticeably slowly.  But this level of optimization is kind of a waste on this 1000-MIPS netbook, let alone a 30,000-MIPS desktop machine.  And it costs a lot of code complexity.<p>By contrast, STEPS treats each letter as a polygon or group of polygons, and rasterizes your polygons when it's time to draw them.  So, among other things, you can rotate, scale, and color your text just like any other object, and the amount of code devoted to text rendering is tiny.  The performance cost may be one to three orders of magnitude in that case, but that's acceptable for an interactive windowing system.",1337489514

I just spent two weeks at conferences and didn't log into any of the Tarsnap servers even once -- and when I spent 36 hours travelling from one to the other (Ottawa to Brisbane -- 23 hours in the air!) I was worried about whether my suitcase would make all the connections, not whether Tarsnap would break while I lacking internet connectivity.<p>But getting to what I think you were really trying to ask: Yes, Tarsnap is much smaller than Dropbox, and I'm happy that I haven't taken money from VCs (or any investors for that matter) who would push for faster growth.  I'd rather have <i>better</i> product than <i>more</i> product; I will probably hire other people to help with Tarsnap at some point, but the question I'll have to answer is not ""can this person do useful work"" or even ""can this person do task X better than I'm currently doing it""; rather, the question will be ""can this person do task X sufficiently better to overcome the cost of my no longer understanding it"".<p>Tarsnap is first and foremost about security.  Security is about getting details right.  And getting details right... well, that requires a level of understanding of how all the different pieces fit together which simply wouldn't be possible if I were hiring dozens of people and throwing them into teams to churn out new features every week.",1337489205

In the context of everyday programming and of the 3 examples I quoted, it's enough to ask yourself questions like: what would a newbie understand? What would an average programmer recognize immediately? If there's a quick obvious answer to either of those questions, and no onerous externalities involved, then that's what you write. (The code being 10X longer or too slow or too likely to contain bugs would be an onerous externality.)<p>This isn't to say that metrics aren't useful here. The question is how to apply them at a low enough cost. In a large company, perhaps one could A/B test variations on coding standards. In a diverse group of small programming shops with internally consistent coding standards or styles, one might gather metrics on bugs per line of code versus features of coding styles.<p>Something to think about. It's not as if metrics are commonly used to make these decisions now. Either edicts come from on high, or the local alpha-coder declarers what's best in her/his experience.",1337488534

We just beat each other up with it without really saying anything meaningful.<p>Programs that were right before continue to be right. Programs that were wrong before continue to be wrong. What's changed is that programs which were wrong before can now be wrong at runtime rather than at compile time. The parts of the program that don't explode now wouldn't have exploded before. So I don't think that really changes the expressiveness, whatever that means.<p>I think this change will do wonders for Haskell marketing but I don't think it will have much effect on the day-to-day lives of Haskell programmers.",1337487403

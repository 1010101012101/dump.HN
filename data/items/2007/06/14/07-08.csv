Granted my experience is VERY limited. <p>I find it hard to imagine that many startups get acquired and it REALLY IMPROVES THEIR VIBE! ;) But maybe I'm wrong, any counter-examples to that scenario?",1181807547

28026,comment,27962,27962,0,0,seer,,,"Mootools! Definitely mootools - it's like stripped down, modified, cleaned and polished prototype. With a bit of work it can integrate with Rails nicely (using a Minus-mor), and the best part is that it encourages you to remove all the bloat from your own javascript classes, resulting in a lot cleaner code. I haven't used JQuery, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about it too, either way, prototype+scriptaculaus is just too fat for me right now (I've had pages where a ""Document Size"" query yielded a result of 105 K - 100K javascript + 4K html + 1K images ... that's just too much)\n",1181806050

So? What does that prove? Who taught you gentleman, to use such useless arguments in a debate. It sounds like ""I do not believe unit tests are useful <i>because</i> I do not use them"". Your logic is reversed.<p>BTW Einstein did not unit test either.",1181805579

28021,comment,27875,27875,0,0,tx,,,"Lets not forget about quality of unit tests. I've seen people writing completely idiotic tests that really do not prevent them from anything (like calling methods and making sure they do not throw exceptions). Such ""unit testing"" is your time well wasted indeed. Another example is to go too low or too high, i.e. being unable to find a proper balance between unit/integration.<p>IMO proper unit testing is a skill and takes some time to acquire. Currently I am thinking about good interview questions for our candidates that help us find out how well people understand the <i>reasons and goals</i> of good UT.<p>Moreover, there are some areas of development that are notoriously hard to unit-test (with good results): Win32 UI is a good example, and even in those cases it's possible to write little, but highly effective UT-code (for instance if you have a unit-test-friendly design in place, like mediator pattern when you can ""drive"" your UI actions by sending commands to it).\n",1181805352

But the company is really just angling to be the biggest and baddest scalper of them all.""<p>I don't see what the problem with scalping is. The scalper pays for the ticket, and then provides the very useful service of making the ticket available at the last minute. The scalper also takes on a risk that no one will want the ticket,<p>I can see that the band/venue/ticketing agency wouldn't like it as they don't get a piece of the action. But that doesn't make it immoral.<p>If tickets are auctioned online by the ticket seller then presumably the band and venue will make more money which will lead to more tours/albums/better venues etc.<p>Auctioning would probably work both ways too in that worse seats would be available for less than they currently are now.",1181805281

It's easy to see that everyone's pulling their weight.",1181804946

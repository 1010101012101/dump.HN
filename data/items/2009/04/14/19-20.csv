I see you arent, but that sounds like it'll be your biggest competitor.  How you plan to get users on board?  B2B?  B2C?<p>Little things:\n1) I like the map where I get to click on the bubbles of numbers to a point.  But once I zoom in on San Francisco, its a little weird to still have bubbles over neighborhoods.  At that point I'd rather just see a list of the top places on the bottom, with pointers ala Google that change as I scan through the list.<p>1.a) ah, and when I got too close, all the bubbles just go away.  How do I actually find the places?  I thought it would be through the map...<p>2)  The white check is a little confusing for ""I want to see it""  Can it be a totally different icon?<p>3)  Ah, was worried I would have to remember the address of the place I added.  Love that you have ACCURATE suggestions.  :)<p>4)  Rating with the stars is a bit tricky. I love that you do %, but I was momentarily confused when it scanned back down even after I clicked.<p>5)  Super easy to use, congrats.  Your UI is clear and concise - I was able to post with ease.<p>6)  Do you have a phone app?  In the works?  That seems like it would be your most important thing.

If you live in a city then you're lucky, because Bell might have at least one competitor operating, usually a Cable company.<p>If you live in even the least-remote rural area you're likely stuck with the choice of Bell or one of the ISP's that piggy backs off of Bell's network. The example here is TekSavvy, their speed on the Bell network is capped at 5mbps despite (in certain areas) Bell can provide 16mpbs to its own customers, however TekSavvy provides unlimited bandwidth for a very reasonable price. $30 for 200gb, $40 unlimited with TekSavvy, but Bell offers 100gb for $80 and thats the best you'll ever get. What Bell is trying to do is make sure all the smaller providers, like TekSavvy, will have to charge their customers more per GB than Bell does.<p>Bell wants you to have to pay $1/GB or <i>more</i> for any other ISP on their network, or you can choose $0.80/GB with them. When currently you can pay $0.15/GB or <i>less</i> with their competitors.<p>Back in the UK BT, who owns almost 100% of the lines, tried to do a similar thing, but regulators stepped in and now you can get internet access from dozens of different providers.

It will be used as a case study one day of how to exercise prudence.<p>Direct from the conference call that explained their exposure:<p>""When AIG was rescued, Goldman Sachs had $10 billion of\nexposure to the insurance company that was offset with $7.5\nbillion of collateral as well as credit-default swaps that would\nhave paid off in the event of an AIG bankruptcy, Viniar said on\nthe March 20 call.""<p>So Goldman had $10 billion of insurance with AIG. As the insurance started going in their favor, as is common banking practice, they demanded collateral be pledged (treasury securities) that they could seize in the event of bankrupty. This was 7.5 billion worth of collateral in extremely safe treasury bonds. So in the event of default, Goldman would have kept the securities in lieu of getting the cash settlement. Because they did not default, AIG had the securities returned to them and they paid out cash instead (this is the 10 billion number that ""went from tax payers to goldman"" that everyone keeps saying). The remainder 2.5 billion was the disagreement between the parties as to where the insurance should actually be marked. So to be prudent, they bought CDS protection that would pay 2.5 billion in the event of default.<p>What is the problem here?",1239738963

562175,comment,561553,561553,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"For a moment, let's consider a local coffee shop (or, for that matter, Starbucks).  As a libertarian, I believe the pricing model for a cup of coffee is the owner's decision, not the government's.  Pay for each cup, pay less for subsequent cups, free refills...none of my business.  If I don't like it, I can go to another coffee shop or open up my own.<p>Pipes and wires to my house are a different manner.  Unlike with the coffee shop, my local government gave a company an exclusive right to serve my house.  No competing companies can run redundant pipes or wires if the original companies aren't offering up good deals.  While its debatable whether or not government should offer such exclusivity, it has.  So, without government intervention, the companies granted these rights will raise prices to the point of profit maximization -- a level of profit that would lead a rational bidder to pay tons for the exclusive license to serve my town.  Think cellular frequency auctions.  Instead of auctioning off rights as a means of indirect tax collection, most towns (or states) granted basically free exclusive licenses with the caveat of pricing and service oversight.  The natural gas monopoly has to petition the state (at least in Ohio) to raise rates.  And, I think the cable companies have to petition the local municipalities.  So, I don't blame these companies as they're just doing what their contracts (might?) allow.  Instead, I find fault with the local governments for selling their citizens short with bad contracts or oversight boards.  Who's watching these government-imposed monopolies?",1239738314

Once again, I have to agree.  Speaking only for myself, I tend to take a Groucho Marxian position, and think that anybody who actually wanted to ""Friend"" me on Facebook must be such a loser as to be someone I'd never actually want to be friends with, and conversely, all of my real friends know me well enough to communicate with me through other, more appropriate channels.<p>So, tell me: what's so funny?

562146,comment,562061,562061,0,0,abyssknight,,,"I answered this over on SO, but here's a copypasta:<p>Really, this is a complicated question. I've worked for start ups, small development companies, and now one of the largest companies in the world. That said, here's my list:<p>1. Location: Being close to home-base helps. Offering positions in California is great, but I need to know why I should make that move. I went through at least three interviews with companies out on the west coast and not one gave me hard numbers on cost of living. Make it appealing, offer assistance and above all don't try to down play the significance of a move.<p>2. Obvious company vision for advancement both in product, position AND knowledge: Knowing that your work will be stagnant leads to mundane work days and eventually, I'd quit. Things have to be kept engaging, interesting and pervasive. I'm all for writing in archaic languages, as long as the goal is to move forward. The day I stop learning from my job is the day I quit. I tell everyone I interview that, and so far its worked well as a filtering comment.<p>3. Work environment & options: Where I am now, we have an interesting environment where we rarely see our coworkers as most of the telecommute, use flex time, or just aren't in our building. That's great, but we still to be engaged. My manager does a great job of keeping in touch to check in on my needs, and desires. Yep, they call us and ask us how we're doing. Management is a LARGE consideration in my choice of jobs. I've worked in too many small companies where management didn't have time to really, well, manage.<p>4. Perks: Yes, everyone likes perks. Insurance, and I mean all of it (medical, dental, vision) is crucial. No benefits? Just hang up now. No 401k or retirement plan? Get one, quickly. Discounts? Now that's just icing on the cake. Not required, but always good to see. Free lunch once a week, drinks and snacks? Awesome, but again, not enough to keep an employee.<p>5. Money: Yes, yes if I had it might way this WOULD NOT be on the list. Unfortunately, after recent interviews (3-4 months ago) I've learned that the value of a developer has little to do with skills or the companies needs but more so their budget. Low-balling after two interviews where everything seemed to go amazingly well is a tell-tale sign of a company who is not willing to pay for what they want.<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/75565/what-does-a-company-have-to-offer-you-for-getting-you-employed/75964#75964"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/75565/what-does-a-company...</a>",1239737640

I thought it could open the door to a lot of cool things. An iPhone could basically become the interface to anything.<p>I looked at the program to see if I could just kind of play with it and see what could be done, (maybe not do anything but at least start imagining projects) but as seiji is saying, it's not as easy as the iPhone SDK where a free account and a download allow you to give it a try: you need a real company behind it and hobbyists have no chance.<p>Does anybody know if anything is possible through the jailbroken community? Can one do something on their own with the iPod/iPhone adapter?",1264046354

In the strictest sense innovation is ""the bringing of the new"" An established company however is based on making money from what they do already. Then they talk about innovation because it sounds good. When we try and define an innovative established company we are not really making sense. What we really mean is ""being clever at what they do already"". The other issue is that share price is more determined by institutional investors rather than market performance.

But that doesn't mean it will be a Verizon exclusive.<p>I highly doubt that Apple would produce a tablet that would work exclusively with Verizon.  Why?  Because of the iPhone.

Two mobile devices, split between two wireless carriers, isn't Apple's MO.<p>That being said, I'm not convinced the fictitious tablet will require 3G data.  Why would it?  If it's a media device, you don't want to pull down HD video over any sort of 3G service.  For that, you'd want to stick with wifi.<p>Okay, so where would this leave us?

You can mix video, games, and 3-D immersion to make the book more of a sensually-rich experience (and harder to copy because it doesn't fit into a neat category).

1066530,comment,1065770,1065830,0,0,tel,,,"One of the most frustrating parts about learning math is that it is a body of knowledge driven constantly to generalization. This usually pays off, because once mathematicians connect just a few dots then often whole new problem spaces just collapse into yesterday's math, taken down by powerful, general theories, like convex optimization, applied with just the right slant.<p>The problem is that often those applications are so wide and varied that nobody bothers to talk very much about them. You're just supposed to understand the underlying purpose and need on your own. For someone with the background, that's ok, because the background is the context that lets you internalize the math. Without the background, applications are necessary.<p>Of course, this is well known for basic math. That's why you learn how to add apples and subtract oranges instead of number theory and fields. At some point, though, if you want to understand ""real"" mathematics, you need to somehow build that critical mass and context shift to where you can get by on the general level.<p><i>My advice is to take the math you do know and go read the proofs that make it operate.</i> Use the applications you already are comfortable with and understand the reasons why they work. Instead of diving both into generalized math and a complex new subject at once, just use your strengths.<p>My anecdote is that I liked math but never really had a grasp on it until I got thrown through the ringer on infinite series, linear algebra, abstract vector spaces all at once. I learned to read and understand proofs (sometimes), I learned how to prioritize when reading complex math (i.e. internalizing definitions is often half or more of the battle), I learned how to synthesize my own general mathematical arguments.<p>I wouldn't call myself anything close to a mathematician, but by jumping into the language and structure of generalized math, I have a lot of the tools to get somewhere with whatever field I want. Wikipedia still often confuses me, but if I want to learn it I know how to take what I learn and use it as the building blocks to a deeper understanding.",1264044179

Britain ruled Egypt for many decades using only 5,000 soldiers and actually turned a profit.  Egypt at the time had 9 million people.  Back in 1900, logistics were even more difficult, and Britain's technological edge was actually much less.<p>The core problem is the the U.S. cultural DNA is anti-imperialist.  No one in state department or DOD has actually read the memoirs from the British empire about how they did it.  Nor is the U.S. willing to use imperialist tactics.  For instance, if you're doing imperialism you need to have a native army reporting directly to the ruling officer class.  Instead, the U.S. is trying to police every street with American soldiers.  Second, instead of encouraging political parties and democracy, an imperialist needs to prevent them.  Political parties incite people to action by blaming other ethnic groups for problems, and they spend all their time worrying about grabbing their peace of the pie.  It's very easy for political parties to turn into actual gangs.  Third, you cannot be afraid to issue the entire population ID cards, have curfews, checkpoints, population control, etc, until the region is pacified.<p>Do the above three things, and imperialism is easy.  You can do it with 5,000 troops and turn a profit.  But do it American style, where you are doing imperialism without admitting it, and you get disaster.",1264043390

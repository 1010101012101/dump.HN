4894750,comment,4893755,4894144,2,0,unalone,,,"> if you accept that not all religions can be true<p>I think, actually, that once you accept that no one religion contains Ultimate Truth, it is <i>much</i> easier to see that every religion is a facet of something true and powerful. Dogma is what insists that only one religion, only one way of doing things, can be the correct way; dogma is always false. But beneath the dogma lies fascinating insights.<p>Personally, I find that the simplest religion, and therefore the ""truest"", is Taoism. The Tao Te Ching is goddamn <i>gold</i>: short, succinct, and brilliant. Buddhism is similarly philosophically inclined; Hinduism is fantastic, and quite explicit in telling you that its gods are metaphors for the world, characters that turn insights about life into stories. Christianity's God-as-man metaphor is a fascinating one that can lead to some very interesting thoughts about our relationship to everything around us. So on and so forth.<p>Those long scholastic traditions are part of why people who don't utterly hate religion argue that anti-theists are missing something important in their insistence that religion be razed to the ground. For all the horrors of dogma, and those horrors are many, the religious tradition has collected millennia of collected human experience and wisdom  it's a treasure trove for anybody seeking to discover those parts of themselves. Let's get rid of the dogma and blind faith, but acknowledge that religion has been a monumental accomplishment for the species that should be respected for what it's done for our race.<p>> So, what method would you propose for determining which academic fields are worthwhile, in their current state?<p>The less dogma, the better. Luckily for us philophiles, philosophy is more obsessed with ending dogma than just about anything, so I guess we'll have to keep it around forever!",1355061591

Methinks you're looking at this the wrong way: it's not that neuroscience ""solved"" philosophy, it's that neuroscientists invented something that directly proves how fascinating philosophy really is. Thanks neuroscientists! Let's let the philosophers take it from here.<p>I compare philosophy to when, after you see the shell beneath your GUI, you start realizing that the same principles that affect programming might affect things that aren't on your computer screen kind of like Plato's shadow puppets, come to think of it. And then you start wondering if things that aren't on your computer screen could affect programming, if only you knew what they were. And then you start wondering how they are all pieced together. And every time you find new pieces, you start wondering where <i>those</i> pieces came from, and every time you start dreaming of new computers, but the really fascinating part is the questions, and the answers are just an afterthought...<p>I love answers as much as anybody, but I love questions so much more. Drugs and Linux are wonderful answers that provoke even deeper questions. Why not let's ask those questions and see what we let neuroscientists come up with next?",1355060952

Cortisol production can highly affect the level of oil and stress you are under, further throwing your body into a loop.

Get Outside! You'll notice that surfers and active beachgoers tend to have clear skin more often than not.<p>Lots of water is just too important to not reiterate. Try to shoot for one glass of water every hour. Want a helpful reminder? Set your own calendar alerts on your phone.<p>Be careful of causing frequent insulin spikes. Fruits, Starches, Sugars, Grains, and Dairy are all stronger insulinotropics (produce a high response in release of insulin) than vegetables, healthy fats, and meats. Having more leafy vegetables and healthy fats (Omega 3s, 100% Grass-fed (Grass-finished) red meats and even grass-fed butter) will flatten out that response to insulin. (You may lose weight by flattening out this insulin level as well).<p>Essentially, everything is a hormonal response. At the end of the day, once you improve what's inside, your outsides will vastly improve as well.<p>With that said, there isn't hope lost once you do have the acne occur. You can use [egg white + coffee] face masks (homemade recipes can easily be found), and spot treatment Benzoyl Peroxide. However I wouldn't recommend doing daily Benzoyl Treatments (Proactive) without making sure you follow the system to the 'T'. The moisturizers are essential and basically required. If you don't use them as provided then you won't fix the acne.<p>You can also just use Murad's Redness Therapy if the acne is red but not ready to surface [<a href=""http://www.sephora.com/redness-therapy-correcting-moisturizer-spf-15-P72003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sephora.com/redness-therapy-correcting-moisturize...</a>] Although I recommend the lotion version, not the cleanser version.<p>You can also use straight up brewed coffee. Rubbing your skin with coffee grinds (as recommend by some places) can scratch your skin, but taking a paper towel and dipping it in hot coffee, and letting that rest on your face for a few minutes will open up the pores and let the caffeine absorb through your skin. Caffeine provides many things, will make your skin more vibrant, but most importantly it is a vasoconstrictor (tightens capillaries that may by causing redness). It even helps fight some of the mold/toxins (The higher the caffeine content of the coffee, for instance, the easier it is for the bean itself to fight off mold before it is roasted).<p>If you want to have more life-changing information, just keep reading! Four Hour Body by Tim Ferriss is a great step, but his writing is really only a stepping stone. For the next step of reading I really recommend Dave Asprey's Bulletproof Executive. Check his stuff out at BulletProofExec.com.",1355059539

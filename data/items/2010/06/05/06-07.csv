For instance, I vividly remember a ""Works with all phones"" tagline plastered everywhere.  Intellectually I <i>knew</i> that claim to be ridiculous, but seeing their recent compatibility table (<a href=""http://help.wakemate.com/faqs/phone-compatibility/supported-platforms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.wakemate.com/faqs/phone-compatibility/supported-...</a>) somehow drove home to me in a new way how wrong their original claim was (I was thinking something like iPhone, Android, WebOS, JavaME.  The new page promises support on about a third of those platforms.)<p>So while your point of ""Better talking than not talking"" is ok I guess, I think it's perfectly fair to feel betrayed on a couple of levels by the way they've handled themselves in the past, and being honest about it now doesn't absolve them of the way they handled their launch.",1275721020

Sure there were fun parts, but there was also loads more pressure and a much greater opportunity to fail than I had experienced in high school.

If it were true that Apple is making a profit from the App Store, then wouldn't there exist an opportunity for Android Marketplace to undercut Apple's App Store?<p>When it comes to smartphones, Google cares only about marketshare. More Android apps guarantees more Google searches, and therefore more opportunities to serve advertising. One factor preventing Google from attaining more marketshare is the huge range of quality apps that exists for the iPhone. If it were true that a 30% cut of app revenue enabled Google to make a significant profit, wouldn't they reduce their cut in an effort to try and attract more developers?<p>>The rendering framerate is very low and is almost not usable.<p>This problem will disappear in a couple of years as mobile processors become faster and JS engines improve.",1275720283

It's sad to see Mozilla acting threatened by Apple on this, rather than throwing its own weight around, presenting their own case to web developers, and taking advantage of this transition to shiny HTML5 goodness to replace the crusty old user agent string method of compatibility checking with the shiny new hotness of discreet feature detection.",1275718986

In financial markets, that's often the worst possible course of action. With S&Ls in the early 80's, for example, Congress could have allowed them to fail, or nationalized them. Instead, Congress gave them extra deposit insurance and deregulated their lending -- which caused them to make lots of stupid loans, backed by government insurance. Similarly, California half-deregulated their energy market, which ended up bankrupting their power companies <i>and</i> costing their consumers extra.",1222793827

How many people understand the evidence of evolution being true, and are able to apologize for it when challenged? There are easy answered for everyone: Evolution made animals; the big bang made the universe. Most people stop at the first reasonable idea passed onto them from authority because it is widely accepted. Don't credit religion for creating in man what was there to start out with, please.<p>Don't be satisfied with easy answers: alway dig deeper for reason. The easy answers to ""Why the central basis to every single religion is wrong"" is temptingly easy as well. (hint: ""it's impossible"") What is the basis for ethical behaviour? (hint: ""herd instinct/evolutionary advantage"") What keeps humanity ""going"" in the face of understanding that each of us and the universe will die one day? (hint: that ""something"" will continue on.) Look deeper, keep asking.<p>Jesus' first and greatest commandment, contrary to popular belief, isn't love your neighbour. It was 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ Christians are required to use our intellects as part of worship. The first step to understanding anything is to find out what it's all about; making insulting blanket statements and feeling condescendingly superior without actual knowledge is something ""the other camp"" does, no?",1222793225

I happen to also think that a collapse will cost the U.S. far more than $700 billion, but they try to imply this bailout is the only way to prevent that collapse. Also: ""The only way your characterization of the bailout as a net transfer of wealth is tenable is if you're against government intervention in financial crises altogether..."" The only way you can think this is if you think that, providing me with a straw man to rail against! And of course the argument against the straw man is essentially worthless name calling in and of it's self, ""...which is silly."" Ah, a quality, well reasoned argument there! Then pretty much lather, rinse, repeat for the next sentence... maybe he's just a troll? I guess I rose to the bait, but I'm shocked such a comment is taken at face value by everyone else.... Looks like two DH0s, a couple of straw man attempts, and although I don't know enough to say much about the first sentence, it does seem like a claim made with out any proof\reasoning.<p>And never mind the fact that even if you support a bailout this one was setup with language to specifically prevent oversight of any kind and would hence almost certainly be extremely corrupt, which rather does characterize that bailout as an attempted net transfer of wealth to me.",1222793125

319714,comment,317549,317549,0,0,geebee,,,"This reminds me of PG's essay on how to create wealth:<p>""his essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.""<p>There was a time when inheritance was considered more honorable than trade (typical of most aristocratic societies), but that's been pretty well dismissed by now.  In most free market democracies, the social respect for huge fortunes tends to be closely correlated with the proximity of the activity to the direct creation of wealth.<p>So high tech tends to be viewed very favorably.  Seeking wealth through marriage is viewed unfavorably (""gold-digging"").  Flipping condos is tolerated but not highly respected, but renovating for a profit is viewed more positively.  Vast sums won through litigation tend to be irritating (though people generally reserve their scorn for the big share taken by the attorney, less so for the litigants).  These activities aren't despised, but they are respected less than the true wealth creators.<p>And lastly, of course, there's genuine hatred for the illegal (or legal but predatory) practices like extortion, robbery, cartel-building, and so forth.<p>Finance probably isn't <i>despised</i> (or at least wasn't until the recent bail-out), but because it's perceived as further down the chain from high-tech, it will generate more resentment than admiration.<p>By the way, high tech isn't completely clean here - Carly Fiorina did receive a huge retirement package - worth about $40 mil, I think.",1222791854

I said it's an easy way to resolve the cognitive dissonance for those who want to.<p>Just to be clear (and because I think it's interesting and would like to hear others on this), let me spell this one out. Say you're an atheist who agrees with that recent comment by Bill Maher that Christians ""drink the blood of a 2000-year-old space god"" (something like that) - in other words, are loony. But like most college-educated Americans you support Obama. Obama is a practising Christian. Who wants to believe that they're supporting a loon for president? It's a classic cognitive dissonance. So you look for a way to resolve the contradiction. One can think of a few:<p>1. Some Christians are loony but others aren't. This is what you originally suggested. But there are a lot of atheists who won't accept it.<p>2. He's loony but he's the lesser of two loony evils.<p>3. He's not a loon. He has to pretend to be Christian for political reasons.

It pays to handle your relations with them very carefully.<p>It's fairly safe to blog about fields that are unrelated to yours. But that doesn't do much for the level of blog discourse.<p>If we want lots of open science blogging we have to change the politics of science funding, publishing, and career advancement -- which might happen, but is likely to happen very slowly. We have to make it so that having a widely-read blog is as good for one's career as quietly sitting on one's results, saying nothing about them in public, until one can get them accepted in <i>Nature</i> (or <i>PLoS</i>, for that matter) three years later. Right now, the old-fashioned stealth approach still seems to be the better bet. Particularly when you consider that, if you're an academic of lower rank than a chair or a dean, and <i>especially</i> if you don't have tenure, the public's opinion of your research is almost immaterial -- it's the opinion of your peers that matters for your career, and you don't need a blog to reach your peers. You need top journal articles and a handful of scientific conferences.",1222790434

You are taking one part of my  argument, adding some bits <i>you</i> thought up and creating a false dichotomy.<p>What <i>I</i> said.<p>(1) Kids don't have as much intellectual sophistication as adults to see through the wiles of product marketing folks.<p>(2) Kids are not in a position of equality of power with  parents. This is ok in general and is only an issue with folks like you use the ""but kids opt in too"" as an argument. ""Consent"" is dicey in a situation of unequal power. In other words I am thinking your ""opt in""  argument is weak.<p>Now that is what  <i>I</i> said.  Where is the disingenuousness again?  The rest of it is your frame. The following is  <i>your</i> opinion not mine - (1)Kids live in a very dangerous world and are at high risk of bad things happening to them unless they can be monitored constantly. (2) Parents can protect them by tracking them constantly (and letting some random company store and process this data)<p>What I think<p>(a) Most kids don't live in an an ultra dangerous world, Sure there are dangerous parts of the world. Most kids do just fine avoiding those.<p>(b) Parents who are <i>constantly</i> worried about their kids being abducted or killed or whatever  and need to spy on them to reassure themselves and have to bribe them with phones to get their ""consent"" to be spied upon   are probably paranoid.<p>(c) irrespective of the ""danger level"" of the world, constant surveillance by parents is not the solution.(This is the same argument governments make when they try to reduce privacy of their citizens _ ""See there are all these terrorists out there and dangerous things may heppen to you when we are not looking  so we have to snoop on you for your own good. If you aren't doing anything sinister what is your problem anyway?"". Sure it is a good scare tactic, but hardly a sound argument.<p>(d) Whether constant surveillance by parents actually reduces any existing danger is yet to be shown. You are only addressing the paranoia not the danger.<p>(e) All of this this has nothing to do with your product reducing the kids privacy to essentially zero from some non zero value, (sure ""just to protect them"" ;-) ).<p>I am trying to give you feedback honestly (since this is HN. I wouldn't bother elsewhere)  Please don't put words in my mouth.<p>That said, <i>now</i> I am getting dubious about you guys personally. You are meeting honest  feedback with mis characterization.

Founders love people who disagree with them (at least a little bit :)) -- we much prefer to hear what's wrong with our products that we can fix rather than hearing about what we've gotten right.<p>I think it's perhaps a little disingenuous to suggest that kids lack the intellectual sophistication to evaluate the consequences of using our app whilst simultaneously suggesting that they are fully capable of evaluating all the dangers in the world that they inhabit: if they don't need the supervision of parents, then surely they can figure out what deal they're taking? If they can't make that kind of decision, I'd argue that they probably do have some growing up to do before their parents could responsibly let them leave their supervision.<p>I say that not only as an interesting intellectual puzzle, but also because we've spoken to kids about this as well as parents. There's definitely an age where kids really, truly can't evaluate what's going on. I don't disagree. What we've found though is that mostly parents don't trust those kids with the kinds of phones they'd need to run this software (even if we did port to Android et al). Indeed, I don't think we've spoken to anyone giving their kids a phone of any kind at age, say, 7, and these kids are under basically constant adult supervision. At the other end of the spectrum, by 16, kids know exactly what's going on, and they're of an age where they could have the kinds of phones they'd need for this.<p>I should point out that these are not numbers I'm pulling out of the air, but summaries of actual conversations we've had with actual kids.<p>The question is really whether there's an age in between where there's a legitimate need for supervision, yet they're responsible enough to be trusted with a phone, and where the children are wanting to start exploring the world and gain some freedom -- it's typically going to be the kids pushing to get more freedom, rather than the parents willingly thrusting those freedoms onto the child.<p>Our position is that there is such a transitional period, when a child goes from basically constant supervision to basically none, and that parents have a legitimate need to know where their kids are. It will vary for different kids and different families, but I do think that easing both parents and kids through that stage with an app like this is a net win for all concerned: if having this app gives parents the confidence to let their kids go farther afield, then we're accelerating the development of the child, rather than stunting it.<p>As for why YC is funding us, we ask ourselves that every day! :)",1281082682

I always tried to use the bicycle for any regular work route under 20km.<p>I use to use my bicycle for a job where I lived outside and the company was in some inner part in Hamburg. 18km.<p>I also used it when I lived in some inner part and was working in some part of the harbour. 16km. There was a Fitness center near the office, I was a member of that chain of fitness centers. I was using the bicycle to get to that fitness center and have a shower there. Then I walked to the office.<p>I would expect that it is important to take a shower before walking into office. It's just a matter of planning. Really good companies have showers for their employees. For example many of the larger companies have some kind of sports facilities.<p>Additional to taking a shower, one also needs some fresh clothes. Also you need a save place for the bicycle.<p>It takes some planning and organization, but once you use your bicycle three or more times per week to get to work and back it pays back.<p>The excellent fitness is what you get in return.<p>Currently I live in a suburb. The whole area is reduced to 30km/h for cars. I use my bicycle a lot. Bus station is 50 meters away. The bus comes every 20 minutes. The bus takes me in 5 or 10 minutes to two local city centers. The next local train is 15 minutes walking or 5 minutes by bus. That local train gets you in 18 minutes into Hamburg City. So, public transport is sufficient for me. Though there is also a Autobahn nearby. Generally connectivity is great.<p>In the inner city of Hamburg one can now rent bicycles and a lot of planning is now done to improve the whole bicycle co system. Even the port authority of the Hamburg port, one of the largest in the world, thinks about using bicycles - they are working on a 'master plan' for using bicycles in the harbour region:\n<a href=""http://www.hamburg-port-authority.de/presse-und-aktuelles/news/519-mit-dem-fahrrad-durch-den-hafen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hamburg-port-authority.de/presse-und-aktuelles/ne...</a>",1281081619

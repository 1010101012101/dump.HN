7045081,comment,7044123,7044418,10,0,nkurz,,,"Anandtech had a nice recent article on server memory types and costs: <a href""http://www.anandtech.com/show/7479/server-buying-decisions-memor"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/7479/server-buying-decisions-m...</a> (<a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=704499"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7044992</a>).  It prompted me to go through and do some math.<p>If you want to cram as much RAM in a server as practical, you&#x27;ll currently be using 32GB LRDIMM&#x27;s which currently cost ~$600 ($20/GB).  Some dual-processor motherboards will take 24 of them (3 ranks * 4 channels * 2 processors) for a 768 GB total: <a href""http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/xeon/c600/x9dr7-tf_.cf"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/xeon/c600/x9d...</a><p>(The 1.5TB description for the board presumes the soon to be released 64GB LRDIMMS.)<p>This would be $15000 for just the 768GB of RAM.  Let&#x27;s guess another $5K for the rest, so $20K for the machine.  At 20GB of dedicated RAM per VPS, you can fit ~40 of them on the machine.  $20K / 40 = $500.   Since this ignores power and connectivity, I think you&#x27;ll be waiting a while for a $5 month plan.  Although perhaps you could overprovision and swap out a lot?<p>Viewed alternatively, the sweet spot for selling RAM does not involve putting as much of it as you can in a single machine.   You&#x27;d cut the cost of your RAM per GB a lot (down to about $10/GB) if you stuck with older lower density RAM put a bunch of low price blade servers in a single box.",1389498578

I was fortunate in that I was a programmer <i>before</i> I decided to join the Army so finding a job when I got out was challenging but easier than my peers found it. For most veterans finding a civilian career and adapting to the civilian workplace is an excruciating experience, in many ways it can be much harder than some of the training they endure. The sad thing is most veterans have the habits of great employees.

One is that disadvantage sounds pretty abstract, pretty diffuse. E.g., disadvantaged youth are ones that happen to be born into poverty. But differential hiring based on names is active and specific.<p>Another is that thing many of the actions that make up privilege are positive ones. People helped me out in ways that other people just weren&#x27;t helped. For example, when you look at the makeup of company boards or executive rosters, it&#x27;s not like anybody said, &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s keep the women out.&quot; It&#x27;s just that they happened to promote a lot more guys.<p>But the biggest thing for me is it puts the focus for action in the right place: on the people who are privileged.

4679430,comment,4679138,4679416,11,0,throwAway7936,,,"Mono certainly works on the server.<p>Your comment just tries to derail the discussion by bringing up Scheme or Lisp in a context where only languages are considered that are widely used in the industry. Otherwise, how could the word ""abandon"" possibly apply?<p>This language shootout has been criticized before. Except for optimized C and C++ there is no popular language (I'm talking about the performance that is due to the design of the language, _not_ a particular implementation. For example dynamic typing is necessarily slower.) that is faster than C#. Try unsafe C# and you know what I mean.<p>Bringing up Scheme here is entirely inappropriate. It's common wisdom that Lisp and Scheme are more beautiful, but this article is about a language that is supposedly ""abandoned"", because it may not be mainstream enough anymore at some point. If C# is abandoned, then what can you say about Scheme?<p>As far as node.js is concerned, it's not a strawman: In fact, the people who claim that MS abandoned C# think that they want to replace it by Javascript. MS even supports node.js in Azure.<p>""concurrency"" is not the same as asynchronicity, which is what I was talking about. And promises are not even close what C# 5.0 tries to achieve. In fact, promises have been present since .NET 4.0.<p>Finally, please explain how Scala is ""intellectually challenging"". This is not my experience.<p>(throwaway account due to procrastination setting)",1350817074

If you want to write server apps, you need to be using the official Microsoft implementation.

It's nicer than Java, it's not ""very beautiful"". Try working through the Little Schemer to see a beautiful language.<p>>And innovation continues: If you've worked with node.js for some time, you will see how ugly code becomes where everything is done using callbacks.<p>Bizarre strawman? What? I don't like Node.js either, but what's your point? A lot of languages that aren't C# have better concurrency idioms than Node. You know, like all of them that aren't C#.<p>> C# just now introduced new syntax where you can basically write code in a linear way and the nesting of callbacks is done by the compiler.<p>Yeah, uh, Scala has had this since forever. And Lisp. And Scheme. And Clojure. And C++. And Node.js (ugh).<p>For a C++ example, look at Tame/Tamer, SFSLite, etc.<p>For anything else, google ""promises"".<p>There is nil that is special about C#, it's a slightly nicer Java without a home or a stable implementation.

4679413,comment,4678755,4679255,4,0,pwang,,,"So, what do people need custom physical objects for?  Especially rigid stuff?  Generally things are rigid either because the application they serve requires the structural rigidity, or because the application they serve requires chemical properties that produce rigidity as a side-effect.<p>If something doesn't have to be rigid, then there are real cost advantages to having it be flexible (such as ease of packing and shipping).<p>So, I ask again: what are common, small, rigid objects which are too expensive now (because of production, transport, or rapid wear)?  Eyeglass frames are one thing I can think of.  Orthodontic retainers are another.<p>Truly, as I think about all the smallish, plastic things that are available in stores, the only thing that comes to mind as an effective use of 3D printing is to pirate children's toys.  Those usually are marked up dramatically because of licensing costs with the movie/TV companies, but otherwise, they're just cheapo plastic.  If you can print them at home for a fraction of the cost, and then sell to your friends as well, that could be very interesting...<p>It would be hard for movie companies to enforce against you, because it's physical peer to peer, and there's no way to trace the artifact back to its producer.",1350815346
4679411,comment,4679196,4679393,1,0,JonnieCache,,,"There's this blurb he wrote on the soundcloud page:<p><i>""When I see a photo of a modular synthesizer, I wonder, as I think many others do, what the thing sounds like. What possibilities lurk within this strange hardware? I want to hear something orchestrated and controlled. I want to hear someone commanding the instrument with authority, not merely floating on waves of serendipity. I want to hear something composed for the instrument, leveraging its strengths, not a orchestration of an existing composition.<p>'A Funneled Stone' is a pure modular synth release, tracked the old-shool, 1970's way: one monophonic line at a time. Every sound you hear was created, patched and recorded for that moment in time. When a new sound is needed, the patch is torn down and a new one is built. Polyphony is achieved by tracking each voice individually.<p>A modular album is, by definition, unapologetically synthetic. I also tried to take a more minimalist approach to orchestration, so the individual sounds can be more fully isolated and appreciated. I spent much of the final month of production taking elements out, and editing for length. Sometimes this results in the remaining elements merely hinting at the underlying harmonic movement.<p>As you can imagine, this process is very time-consuming, but fun. I hope you enjoy the results as much as I enjoyed creating it.""</i><p>For more super-hi-tech-math-music have a listen to this: <a href=""http://detroitunderground.net/blog/2012/05/03/vaetxh-libet-tones-du17/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://detroitunderground.net/blog/2012/05/03/vaetxh-libet-t...</a><p>That page has technical descriptions of what's happening in each track.

However be careful of affirming the consequent (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent</a>) ... just because Feynman won the nobel prize because he decided to ""play"" for a while to reinvigorate his interest in Physics, doesn't mean that if you play for a while it will also result in something useful.<p>edit: upon reflection I'm not sure this is actually the ""affirming the consequent"" fallacy after all ... but I think the point is made nevertheless.

That's the general direction the US government has taken for a long time. The Supreme Court has shaved the ""unreasonable search and seizure"" protection so thin, that it almost doesn't ever apply. The COINTELPRO (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO</a>) efforts in the 60s shows that the US government hasn't really respected any kind of privacy for a very long time. Banning encryption is the end point of a couple of trends, copy protection (a.k.a. ""Digitial Rights Management"") and ""The War on Terrorism""/""The War on Drugs"". The US government just can't make certain that nobody's ""Intellectual Property"" isn't being ""stolen"" if any encrypted information flows.  Similarly, encryption only helps ""terrorists"" and ""drug dealers"" trying to ""launder money"" or recruit other terrorists to sell crack or something, I get all confused.<p>But seriously folks, read the writing on the wall: banning encryption is the end point of some trends with a lot of power behind them.",1356915361

4987777,comment,4986365,4987730,4,0,rprasad,,,"That's not how marketing works, now or ever.  The sole purpose of marketing is to drive sales of a product or service.  Marketing is profitable to the seller if (a) it yields more customers/clients than in the absence of marketing expenditures and (b) net income is higher (either larger profit or a smaller loss).   See e.g., Apple, which spends more on marketing every year than the combined GDP of several dozen small nations.<p>Removing marketing would not magically make everything cost cheaper; marketing is usually a small % of a product's costs.  Several of my clients are multinationals selling various consumer goods; for them marketing is almost a rounding error compared to COGS, payroll, or facilities (i.e., less than 5% of gross expenses).<p>The primary effect of removing marketing is that suddenly all sellers and service providers would have difficulty reaching new customers.  This would benefit existing companies, but it would <i>kill</i> startups of all kinds (tech and non-tech alike).",1356915134

This requires initial capital, for example. Most people do not have capital.<p>> And ... is it right for government to forcibly take a piece of ownership away and give it to the worker? Is that the proposed solution?<p>Chomsky is an anarchist, so no, he would not suggest that. it's actually the opposite: the ability of the owner to retain ownership is due to contractual agreements that the state upholds under threat of violence. Without the state, corporations (and capitalism) are not possible.<p>> Gosh, when you look at this discussion, you ask yourself, ""Why on earth would anyone sign up to be a perpetual worker?""<p>:) An observation that Marx made was that because the worker sells their labor-power (ie, capacity to labor), they do not get to retain the advantages of increased productivity: the capitalist does. When we become more productive, we have two choices: work less, or work the same and get even more. The ones with the power make those decisions, and since they're not the ones doing the work, guess which they choose? The movement from the 12 hour day to the 10 hour day to the 80 hour day to the 40 hour week was not due to productivity gains: it was due to socialist and other worker-led movements.<p>> (I promise I did not set out towards that goal ... I stumbled there by ""thinking out loud"").<p>No worries :) I'd say that you're confusing correlation and causation: there are many, many more traditionally structured businesses than socialist ones.

4987758,comment,4987141,4987141,3,0,morjanoff,,,"I first learnt meditation at age 11. Lucky that my parents thought it valuable. Have discovered several different types over the years, some more useful than others.<p>TM, transcendental meditation involves being given a specific mantra by a TM master. This is usually a word that you focus on during the meditation for 20mins twice a day. It works if you work it as with most things. You can choose a word, like 'focus' or 'love' to meditate on even if you haven't been given an official mantra. Or you can simply visualise the flicker of a candle flame in your minds eye.<p>Mindfulness is the most useful meditation form I've found to help me. It is not a dedicated time that you 'do' meditation, but a greater awareness of yourself and all around you as you go through life. It is becoming the observer. Simply by noticing your thoughts and noticing yourself noticing your thoughts it can bring about a much higher level of clarity.<p>The great thing with this is you can set up certain triggers to remind you to do it. There are several apps that can ding at a random interval and remind you to become aware. Or you can use walking through a doorway as your trigger.<p>For me personally, I want to improve my levels of patience. So now any time I feel impatient, I use that as my trigger to become present to where I am, what I'm feeling and how I'm being.<p>Being impatient is essentially rejecting the reality of 'now' for some preferred future. So by coming back to experiencing the present moment as if I had chosen it myself, it's quite a powerful way to then move forward.<p>Best book I've read that can help with this is Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.<p>There are many kinds of visualisations, breathing techniques, silence and stillness exercises, but the most useful to actually making a difference in life is mindfulness from my experience.

But if some miraculous new development happened, if only this technology could develop at a pace as fast as some incredible outlier such as integrated circuits, then it would be a revolution!<p>In fact there is nothing that revolutionary about 3D printing, and it is very closely related to manufacturing technologies that were simply developed earlier because they held more economic potential. At its core, a 3D printer is a working head that is computer-controlled to move in three dimensions with an attached tool that <i>deposits</i> small amounts of material. A CNC milling machine is also a 3D-moving working head with an attached tool that <i>removes</i> small amounts of material. This is far more useful because you can work with any kind of material you want.<p>""Ah,"" the 3D printing evangelists will say, ""but that is so wasteful! We need an accretive process to economize material."" Except we already have another widely-successful industrial process that also works by adding material: industrial robotics. An industrial robot arm is a computer-controlled 3D moving working head (notice a pattern here?) that can add new parts to an existing workpiece. The parts are standardized and mass-produced separately, at a ridiculously low price, out of ridiculously strong materials.<p>So between CNC milling and industrial robotics, which are basically the same technology with different working heads, there is just not that much of a niche for 3D printing to make a dent into. Yes, that could change tomorrow if aliens came down from heaven and brought us a miraculously advanced 3D printer. But at that point the discussion reaches ground previously reserved for messianic religions, a discussion that I'd rather stay out of right now.",1356914469

In reality, these are helpful, yes, but mostly what it indicates is that you know a lot about the game of chess. Similarly, there is a perception that skill at Scrabble indicates a large English vocabulary.<p>It's reasonable for someone with good reasoning or a large vocabulary to find it distasteful that they lose consistently simply because they haven't memorized the 1,000 most common moves.[0] In chess, this is pretty much built into the mechanics of the game, but it's easy to fix in Scrabble with a simple house rule: Don't use bullshit words.<p>It's only part of the game if you let it be.<p>[0] I'll give an illustrative example. The official Scrabble dictionary[1] lists ""re"" with the definition ""the second tone of the diatonic musical scale"". Just so for the other sounds of diatonic solfeggio that everyone knows: re, mi, fa, sol, la, and ti. All of these, according to Hasbro, are English words, with plurals.<p>We're all descriptivists here, that's fine. But did you ever wonder why there are only seven words for the diatonic scale, but actually twelve tones in an octave? Or why re, mi, and fa have different vowel sounds? The answer is that solfege has a way to verbalize accidentals (notes not in the key) or non-diatonic scales by modulating the vowel sound. A raised do is a di; a lowered re is a ra. So you can easily pronounce a chromatic scale beginning at do: do, di/ra, re, ri/me, mi, fa, fi/se, sol, si/le, la, li/te, ti, do. (The syllable used depends on the key.)<p>Go ahead, look up any of those accidental syllables in the dictionary. La and le: Both French articles, both solfeggio syllables. Only one is a Scrabble word. You can't say that's not stupid.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/search.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/search.cfm</a>",1356913562

Here it is:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/4416107"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/4416107</a><p>I just threw it together quickly.  It's got some warts (not the best code for grabbing data from Wikipedia).  Of course, feel free to do with it as you wish.<p>I only sampled a couple dozen countries or so.  It seems that the author of the graphic decided to take a little license here and there rather than making strict use of the word with the most usage.<p>For example, if I didn't screw-up the code, in Canada the most frequent words are:<p><pre><code>    [ 143] books
    [ 118] canadian
    [  95] british
    [  82] war
</code></pre>
However, the author decided to use ""british"".<p>In Argentina:<p><pre><code>    [  53] president
    [  50] argentine
    [  47] war
    [  46] military
</code></pre>
Yet he used ""war""<p>Brazil:<p><pre><code>    [  28] military
    [  22] portuguese
    [  19] portugal
    [  16] first
    [  15] war
</code></pre>
The choice was ""military""<p>Saudi Arabia:<p><pre><code>    [ 114] saudi
    [  76] arabia
    [  37] king
    [  31] oil
    [  28] arab

Chosen: ""oil""<p>I am not passing judgement at all, just pointing out what I learned from a very limited test.  At some level It would be interesting to see data for all countries.  At the same time, a better metric than single-page word frequency would probably be more interesting than this.

You're dealing with ""strings"" made of ""characters"".<p>I don't remember when was the last time I had to manually read bytes / data and ""convert"" them using whatever character encoding.<p>You're questions just feel weird.

We use properties file (whose encoding is defined) to contain our UTF-8 characters.<p>Wanna transmit text?  Well, use a format which allows to specify the encoding of your text.  It's really that simple and, on the other end of the wire, it's going to become automagically again ""strings"" and ""characters"".<p>Another ""detail"": Go is one the only language to specify that source file have to be encoded in UTF-8.

And you think that I haven't thought about this at all, probably because I don't share your professional experiences.<p><i>limiting copyright to Hollywood</i><p>Nope, never said that. If you were paying attention, I said ""Find a business plan that works without copyright or admit defeat"". People who sell software by the copy? Yep, they're screwed. People who sell books about comparative literature? Screwed. Budding photographer? I think you see where this is going. As you say, this covers all media. Pretty sure I was articulate in saying ""media"".<p>This becomes an argument about Hollywood because I haven't seen any professional photographers lobbying congress to record everything that happens on the Internet in case someone doesn't pay to use their photographs.<p><i>You say, for instance, that physical production was the natural means of enforcing copyright. This is wrong.</i><p>I'm sorry, but you've gone off the rails here. Where is the legal protection of food recipes (not the copyright of their text, but the performance of them)? Or combinations of clothing? It takes effort and skill to come up with good combinations, that investment should be protected. These things are not legally protected because anyone can do it, and so there is no means of enforcement. Copyright worked because printing presses were big and expensive, and the owners colluded to reduce market competition. It was essentially an opt-in system that was beneficial to participants. Modern copying is so trivial that nearly 100% of the time you don't even realize you're doing it. Even when you play by the DRM rules, there is plenty of intermediary copying being done on your behalf. How do you expect to enforce any of this?<p><i>that means accepting a framework that will MAKE you pay in the event you refuse to</i><p>I don't accept that. Laws are not so arbitrary, and indeed there are consumer protection laws to shield people from undue ""enforcement"". But you can't force people to pay for the smell of food, or their unauthorized performance of the latest pop hit in the shower, or copying data. To create a society in which enforcement of these is possible requires a distortion that does more damage to society than the property it protects.<p><i>eternal vigilance is the price of liberty</i><p>Indeed, and it appears that you are on the wrong side of it.<p>EDIT: Wow, your comment is like twice as long now.<p><i>Now you've said you're not willing to accept copyright.</i><p>Actually, no. I have said that I pay for my copyrighten material. My argument not so shortsighted. My argument is that copyright is, essentially, doomed. If you are still able to enforce it now, you will not be able to enforce it real soon. I also said that you should come up with a new business plan, which you have violently rejected. Ultimately, that's cool... you'll just find your business to be increasingly less profitable until you have to make money some other way. It isn't a threat, it's a warning.<p><i>So what are your ideas for inflicting the pain that is a necessary part of doing business among humans?</i><p>Yes, let's start here. I get the impression that you're highly passionate about what you do, which is probably why I'm still replying. You want to continue to do so for the rest of your life, and possibly pass something on to your children. And to that end, you think that convincing me that I am wrong will help you. It won't. I'm the lighthouse telling the aircraft carrer to divert its course: honestly, it's your call.<p>But looking for a means of forcing people to obey your will is too brutish, simplistic, and obvious. It won't work. You need something that makes people feel good about how they rewarded someone who deserved it. There is both the stick and the carrot.<p><i>Do you have ANY ideas at all?</i><p>Well, not really. If I did, I would be the first person in line to start a business around it. Maybe it looks like advertising or product placement. Maybe films that are only shown in cinemas. Edward Bernays made money selling pianos by influencing contemporary homebuilding culture to include ""music"" rooms that people usually filled with pianos.<p><i>Telling me I need to figure out a business model that doesn't demand legal protection is the same as telling anyone they need to figure out a business model that doesn't demand legal protection. It's stupid, it's oblivious to the facts of life, and it needs to end.</i><p>You are really in the wrong forum to say things like that.<p><i>You need to be clear about what kind of protection you're going to offer the people who pour their lives into this. That's the deal. People who make the stuff are doing their part. Now kindly step up and do yours.</i><p>How is that my part? I understand most of what you're saying, but cut the dramatics and face the reality. We all pur our lives into what we do. Everyone, all over the globe. Just because what you do has been profitable for a small number of people over the last 50 years doesn't mean it will continue to be.

For UI, the libraries for JavaScript far outstrip anything available for Java!)<p>I do seem to be gravitating toward an organization scheme that centralizes my applications data into a single place such that all moving pieces of the application get a shot at dealing with inbound messages in an orderly fashion. This allows me to decompose the application into a very small number of function types, each of which has an explicit kind of responsibility.<p>The only time I've been tempted to go back to OOP has been to write (pure!) functions that seem to just beg for it - complex validation routines in particular. But using OOP for the app as a whole seems to not only be unnecessary, but positively undesirable.",1356912232

I.e they had not just reached menopause, and thus represent a different population to that which would normally be prescribed HRT. Besides increased heart disease, stroke and VTE the study group also had reduced Colorectal cancer and Hip fractures that were statistically significant.<p>Subsequent to this study, the KEEPS study (which may not have been published yet) randomised women to placebo, transdermal HRT and oral HRT, and which selected patients more appropriately as they were going through menopause, is showing no significant difference in CV outcomes or stroke, blood pressure or cancers between all groups.<p>Another study, the DOPS study, a 10y follow up of 1000
Women over 50 on either HRT or placebo shows decreased CVD and no change in stroke or cancer risks.<p>This study overturned the notion that for the <i>general</i> female population, HRT would exert various cardiovascular benefits.<p>Nowadays it is established practice to only use HRT for severe symptoms of menopause (severe, lifestyle crimping hot flushes, mood changes etc) which in some women can last for many years. However treatment is meant to be reviewed regularly and tapered down.",1356912102

If Americans came to believe leadership should be based on superior personal virtue, then they might reject democracy, a la Plato and Confucius.  If North Koreans came to believe that there is not a single ""virtue"" that makes a person superior at everything, that different people can be good or bad at different things, such as good at seeking power and bad at ruling justly, then they might demand institutions to protect themselves from the weaknesses of their leaders.  They might decided that executive leadership is just a job that should be done by someone who is good at that particular thing, and that ordinary citizens are as qualified to choose their leaders as anyone else.",1356912041

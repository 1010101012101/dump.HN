3268218,story,,,5,5,Gabriel_Martin,"Ask HN: Got time to volunteer for an entrepreneur?",,"This is a call to the HN community for individuals who can give back by joining the ""Entrepreneurial Advisory Corps"" (link below). The EAC is is a team volunteers (on Angellist, though not affiliated with AngelList) who offer to spend  time helping a nascent entrepreneur. The process is simple, we have you comment on what you hope to contribute with your time, and when a request comes in which matches that, the two of you are connected. How volunteers offer to contribute, and how much time they spend is up to them.<p>Entrepreneurs approach the EAC with many needs, so having a diverse set of volunteer skills is very important. Even a small amount of time and effort can really help give shape to young startups, and give confidence to young entrepreneurs. We all have insight and experience to share, and this is a great opportunity to give back to your community, while maintaining flexibility in your schedule. Also, you get to be connected to awesome young startups, where your perspective could make all the difference.<p>For those seeking advice, we are all more than happy to offer advice, perspective, links to information and moral support. There are some amazingly helpful volunteers with a very diverse set of skills who are willing to help. However, I must qualify the offering by saying that despite being on AngelList, we do NOT promise investor intros, endorsements or money, so please be considerate of that, and your volunteer's time, and make the best use of it!<p>Very happy and pleased to be delivering this message to you, and would love help spreading the word via this twitter link: http://bit.ly/vlle1s<p>Entrepreneurial Advisory Corps (http://angel.co/entrepreneurial-advisory-corps)",1322009972

Just as DSP's are now programmed in (almost) vanilla C/C++/..., we will see FPGAs being programmed using the same languages as micros and DSPs.

3268155,comment,3267921,3267921,4,0,mgkimsal,,,"Some of the comments from people in line are funny - it's a clever ad.  I just don't think it's gonna do all that much to stem the Apple/iPhone juggernaut any time soon.  The ecosystem around the iPhone is enormous - the cases, adapters, accessories all will fit and work with pretty much any iPhone from the last couple of years (tens of millions of them).  Some hotels you go to now have alarm clocks with iPod/iPhone docks in them.  This is a device which is being ingratiated in to society.  A cute ad talking about a bigger screen is probably not going to do much to sway people.  Samsung coming up with a truly different experience - say, in the way people buy the device - would get converts.  I'm thinking specifically of selling the device with no contract or ""subsidized"" pricing schemes - just saying, hey this is $199, then taking a cut of sales from an app market (bundle a kick-ass Samsung marketplace app and start courting devs, for example).  Or promoting Kindle on the bigger screen and taking a few cents from each Kindle.<p>Or something - something different from what we've had from phone companies for years.  Model XYF573 - rev2!  Now with more colors!  Oh, and 4G!  Then 2 months later that model isn't produced any more, and we're on to rev3, which is a different form factor... wash, rinse, repeat.  Yes, I exaggerate slightly, but I got tired of trying to compare all the various specs some time ago.<p>I was a linux guy for years, and got tired of things not working, not being mainstream, etc.  I was a Linux guy when Windows was cool, then Linux when Mac was cool.  I finally caved in and went Mac.  It's good - nay, just easier - being part of the majority for a while.  It's not that I don't think about my tech choices, I just spend more time thinking about stuff at another level of abstraction (get an iPhone, now decide which of the X thousand apps I want to use to make my life better).  Getting device X solely because of specs (bigger screen!) generally won't make my life easier/better.<p>Apple is on top right now, just like MS/Windows was in the 90s.

3268087,comment,3265601,3267722,2,0,ikarous,,,"I am a depression patient. It is certainly true that various substances can induce depression. I do not believe that the original poster was implying that depression is without very real biological causes; merely that these causes are more nuanced than the phrase ""chemical imbalance"" implies. Here is some food for thought.<p>SSRIs, or serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the United States due to their relative safety and efficacy. It is widely thought that these drugs achieve effectiveness through their ability to increase serotonin levels in the brain. Now, here comes the mystery: while serotonin levels rise almost immediately following introduction of the drug, the antidepressant effects do not become apparent until several weeks of treatment have passed. Why is that? No one knows for sure, but a few interesting theories have emerged.<p>The most interesting theory, in my opinion, involves hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF levels. A few recent studies have shown that one thing that the SSRIs share in common is that they all promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus. A further study showed that the antidepressant effects of SSRIs on behavior in rats exposed to artificially induced stressors could be completely nullified by slightly irradiating the hippocampus, thus negating the growth of new neurons promoted by the SSRIs. The antidepressant effect was gone even though serotonin levels remained elevated.<p>This conclusion provided compelling but not conclusive evidence that neurogenesis is involved in antidepressant effectiveness. Yet even here, the picture was not altogether clear: while patients diagnosed with clinical depression generally show less hippocampal neurogenesis than controls, it is not at all clear whether this deficit is a cause or effect of clinical depression. Is it possible that depression, once established, can cause physical changes in brain structure? If so, that might explain why cognitive behavioral therapy in conjunction with antidepressant medication is a more effective depression treatment than either of the two alone.<p>Interestingly enough, strenuous aerobic exercise is known both to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate forms of depression as well as a promoter of hippocampal neurogenesis. An increasing number of psychiatrists are in fact prescribing exercise regimens as treatment for some forms of depression because it seems to work.<p>The bottom line is: there's a lot we don't know about depression, and while we have effective treatments, the reality is that the causes of depression simply cannot be adequately summed up as a ""chemical imbalance."" Drugs are appropriate for some patients and inappropriate for others. I encourage anyone interested in the subject to do some reading, as the brain is (at least, to a layman like me) the most fascinating information processing system ever.",1322007238

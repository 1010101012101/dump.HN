I&#x27;d like to see a more thoughtful piece which takes a stance on the industry as a whole and whether we should be concerned about whether history is being misrepresented or people are actually learning from these games.<p>My guess is that, for most mainstream titles, they are doing a poor job educating about history. For example, while I loved Bioshock, including the story, it very much misrepresents Rand&#x27;s  Objectivism. In the same way, I&#x27;m sure many developers are calling on only so much as what they remember from high school in order to develop characters and settings which seem familiar to players. As gaming becomes a more dominant medium, we should probably begin calling out games which instill a twisted view of history in the minds of the public.",1410950980

8329374,comment,8326845,8327019,2,0,mikeash,,,"Look at capabilities, not looks. Dragon V2, if it lives up to its promise along with F9R, means dramatically reduced costs for launching people into space through almost complete reusability of the launch vehicle and capsule. Turnaround times on the order of days, launch costs in the single-digit millions, it would be <i>huge</i>. It&#x27;s basically all of the empty promises of the Space Shuttle, but (it appears for the moment, at least) with the hardware to back it up.<p>CST-100 makes similar promises if it can be matched with a reusable launcher (perhaps F9R). I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re looking at similarly short turnaround times (probably not). But they&#x27;re much less far along and it&#x27;s hard to judge if they can deliver.<p>Dream Chaser also makes similar promises, again if it can be matched with a reusable launcher. What&#x27;s the advantage of it over the others? As far as I can see, the only real advantage is less gee loading during reentry. In exchange, you add a lot of complication and weight (wings and wheels). It doesn&#x27;t seem worth it at all.<p>Spaceplanes look cool, but what&#x27;s the point? The goal should be robustness and cheapness, with reusability a necessity for enabling the latter. Vertical powered landing with a capsule looks like an <i>excellent</i> way to achieve this.",1410950297

We built an app that helped you gather the requirements (clever Apache Tika integration for pulling things out of tendering docs in different formats), manage the process of keeping track of how the requirements change though the project (lovely Node and Backbone single page app), and then export the final requirements document at the end to pass on to acceptance and testing QA teams. We spent about 2 full years thinking about how best to stop requirements getting out of hand, putting a stop to scope creep and gold plating, and making project less prone to failure.<p>Unfortunately we forgot to prove that there was actually a market. At the top end when you&#x27;re designing an aeroplane there are huge enterprise apps for doing this stuff. At the bottom end a decent project manager can keep it all in their head. In the middle, there&#x27;s a few project management apps that make a nod to requirements, but not much, so we thought we could sell to that segment. We were wrong.<p>The problem is that the cost of failing to manage change in a project isn&#x27;t actually very big. The project might be a few weeks late, or $5000 over budget, or it fails to do something that was in the list of requirements, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal to either the client or the team implementing it. No one&#x27;s job is on the line. There aren&#x27;t any penalties. It&#x27;s just &#x27;oh, we should fix that I guess&#x27;.<p>Gathering requirements, and keeping on top of what changes, is never as important as the project as a whole, and it turns out that a lot of projects just aren&#x27;t very important to the people doing them.",1410949709

A person who can&#x27;t perform your test adequately isn&#x27;t suddenly going to power through it because they had more time, they&#x27;ll just fuck things up even more with the extra time.  Even ignoring all that, if you really want to hire the best developers (and lets assume such developers will deal with your work sample test in the first place which surely isn&#x27;t a given, btw) wouldn&#x27;t you rather give the dedicated craftsmen who will pour more time than you expected (out of professional pride for things they put their name on) to come up with a really clever implementation to show you what they are actually capable of building rather than just show you what they can shit out in a couple of hours?<p>Putting a hard & quick deadline on it is such a dumb thing to do.

As a hacker, I at least need access to these things: a good laptop, a high-speed internet connection, access to books, a little bit of extra money to attend local conferences/meetups, etc. Btw bootstrapping yourself is actually easiest if you're a computer hacker - imagine how hard it'll be if your passion is something else (maybe your dream is to build a kick-ass electric car).<p>In developed countries, you can get access to this bare minimum stuff even if you didn't go to college and you're doing some part-time work while pursuing your dream on the side. In USA, you can move to a cheap, small town and save significantly on rent while not compromising that much on quality of life (if you ignore things like access to awesome restaurants, great night-life, etc). In India, if you move to a rural area, first of all you've to face 5+ hours of power cuts, no (high-speed) internet, expect to walk around with buffaloes, goats on the street - you'll be completely cut off from the mainstream). So it's very important you go to the best colleges in the country and get hired by the best companies, so you don't have to worry about these basic necessities. Things are of course continuously changing - another 20 years and maybe the standards of living will catch up with the West.<p>Also if you don't go to college, then you can forget about visiting USA or anything other country ever. None of these countries will ever offer visas to people who haven't gone to college. This is not a problem if you were born American - the land of all great opportunities :-)",1269421115

1215219,comment,1213442,1213442,0,0,ippisl,,,"What: Journal of Applied Psychology article about teleworking and professional isolation
...<p>Bottom line: The authors surveyed 261 professional-level teleworkers at a large corporation (80,000 workers) to study the effects of professional isolation, which is defined as a state of mind that one is out of touch with others in the workplace, on job performance and turnover intentions. Professional isolation led to lower job performance and lower turnover intentions. The effect on turnover intentions was contrary to expectations. The authors argue that this unexpected effect may be due to professionally isolated teleworkers losing faith in their skills and knowledge and their ability to find alternative employment. Another possible explanation may be that teleworkers face family or dual-career constraints due to which they telecommute as a way to maintain their job. Or it may be that those who telecommute enjoy its benefits more fully, so that despite professional isolation, they donâ€™t seek employment elsewhere. The authors report other findings too. For instance, professional isolation led to even lower job performance for those who spent greater time teleworking and lesser time interacting face-to-face.  In other words, the negative effect of professional isolation on job performance reduced for those who teleworked less as well as for those who engaged in extensive face-to-face. To reduce professional isolation, the authors make several suggestions. One of the suggestions is to include structuring activities between coworkers to ensure sufficient levels of task and social exchanges, so as to build and strengthen interpersonal connections while achieving work objectives.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.leadingvirtually.com/?p=157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leadingvirtually.com/?p=157</a> ,  which is a great blog on all aspects of remote work.",1269417883

Dealing with rich, non-technical people like that is a skill that requires quite a lot of training, as far as I can tell, either that or it requires some innate qualities that I appear to lack.<p>However, if you run your business as if you were producing commodities, charging slightly more than the cost of production, it's quite easy for an Engineer to handle 'business' as it's all about efficiency.   I mean, obviously, you still need a specialist for accounting, but most business people are not accountants.   Hell, even some of the higher-margin businesses can be handled by Engineers if you use web sales, A/B testing and the like.   (I know some Engineers who handle face to face interaction much like A/B testing a webpage, but that's damn hard to pull off while looking natural.)<p>Now, obviously, I'm not a really awesome business guy.  I mean, I'm still eating ramen so I can buy servers.  I'm just saying... there is a part of business that seems pretty easy and clear to me  (which is to say, efficiently managing the production of product, acquiring raw material, recruiting technical people, etc...)   and another part that I understand so poorly that it looks like magic or fraud.  I mean, why do customers tolerate sales teams charging different prices to different companies based on negotiation?   I mean, obviously, if I'm, say, buying servers (something I know a thing or two about, both for myself, and for larger clients)  I don't understand why many companies will give you a lower rate if you waste a bunch of their salesguys time.  I mean, sales people don't work for free, right?<p>So yeah, clearly there are some parts of ""Business"" that as one mentor once said: ""same planet, different universe""",1269417858

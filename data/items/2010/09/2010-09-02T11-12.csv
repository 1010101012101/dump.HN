It helps. Really. Try to write as much as possible in English.<p>I'm benefiting a lot from both these facts. Read as much as possible in English; get your daily news from the NY Times, read technical blogs written in English, etc.
Try to write as much as possible. Keep a diary in English; try to answer questions over at StackOverflow; try to comment on articles posted here on HN.<p>You should also adjust your environment to support you with learning the language. For example, I've installed Lauchy (<a href=""http://launchy.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://launchy.net</a>) and I've set up a shortcut to <a href=""http://dict.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dict.cc</a>; I launch Launchy, type in <i>d myword</i> and get an English translation of <i>myword</i>. I'm pretty productive thanks to this little shortcut, and I'm constantly learning new words.",1283428730

It works well for sign-up forms but there are cases in which it's better to focus on early user engagement at the expense of a short form.<p>For example, in cases where the user is expected to create or design something for use later, it makes sense to immerse them in the creation process even if it means your form is longer than normal. 
The key thing, imho, is to keep the number of pages down to 1 (or max 2) and give live feedback.<p>More details in my earlier comment:

Here's our first hand experience:<p>We used to have a 5-stage ad campaign creation process in our SaaS self-service ad manager. 
Once we started measuring cart abandonment rates, we noticed that users dropped off after the first 2 steps. 
It gets even worse if you require users to sign-in first<p>The solution:
1. We replaced it with a 1-page process
2. This is the crucial bit. We allowed users to create their ads BEFORE signing up.<p>By seeing a live preview of their ads, we engage them early and dramatically improve conversion rates.<p>The morale of the story is that keep the steps short (even if the form is long) and provide instant gratification.<p>Here's a link to the form on our demo site :

    (setq x-select-enable-clipboard t)
    (if (functionp 'x-cut-buffer-or-selection-value)

All your problems with cut and paste between Emacs and other programs? Gone!<p>The if statement stops it failing when you use it on other platforms.<p>EDIT: I also really really like this bit which I've not seen in other peoples lists:<p><pre><code>    (defun eshell-goto-current-dir (&optional arg)

    (global-set-key ""\C-cs"" 'eshell)
    (global-set-key ""\C-cS"" 'eshell-goto-current-dir)
</code></pre>
That means I can switch to eshell with C-cs or a can switch to eshell <i>and</i> change the current directory to be the same as the file I was viewing with C-cS.

My wife is trying to bootstrap a company in the same sense that you are. Instead of a million dollar investment, we've ""invested"" what her old salary was (she quit her job a few months ago to explore doing this).<p>But it's obvious that she's going to need some more money than that to hire a designer, a part-time lawyer, pay for hosting and probably get one more developer for what she wants to do...and we simply don't have the cash for that. So she's seriously thinking about looking for an investor to hire those people. A quarter million would probably cover those expenses for 18 months.<p>I don't know what to call that, ""investor assisted bootstrap""?<p>It's definitely a different model than ""I have an idea, give me money, I'll go hire 20-30 people and we'll make a go at it for a year"", which is certainly not bootstrapping.<p>My own company tried that ""instant company model"" a few years ago and it didn't work out, so we reconstituted the company with different leaders and different VCs, and now are following this hybrid mixed bootstrapping model...and you know what?

5046,comment,5031,5045,0,0,notabel,,,"Quantitatively and predictively, no.  You can only look at the outcomes from YC-funded companies, see to what extent they beat the curve.  Of course, you still have to sort out the potentially higher quality of YC fundees to begin with.  It's a hard statistical problem; any takers?",1174333089
5045,comment,5031,5034,0,0,usablecontent,,,"I haven't written about them because they are making money comparable to the likes of Sequoia, but the effect it is having and will continue to have in making smart people realize their true potential. <p>Is there any measure to transform the value of awareness, mentorship and intellectual capital into money?

5044,comment,5031,5041,0,0,notabel,,,"Shooting in the dark, I'd say one big difference is the focus on the founders, rather than just throwing money in and hoping for something valuable to pop out.  You can see that in the YC application--very different from a request for a business plan.",1174332792

5042,comment,5031,5034,0,0,notabel,,,"Another possibility is that YC could maintain a higher percentage of success, at a lower individual return.  Because YC attracts some of the best young talent around, is very selective in funding, and seriously optimizes their fundees chances of success, it's not unreasonable that YC could maintain a better batting average than the VCs.<p>Another possibility is that because YC tends to form definite relationships with the founders they fund, they can count on the law of large numbers within, not just between, teams.  For instance, YC lost money on Kiko, but is also invested in justin.tv--if justin.tv makes it, the YC[kiko folk] relationship could still end in the black.<p>N.B. This is all complete speculation; any more insight from pg would be appreciated.",1174332674

5040,comment,5025,5025,0,0,jwecker,,,"It's interesting- I think most people would rather get the higher salary regardless of cost-of-living or spending power.  Some kind of gratification to their self-worth or something.",1174332641
5039,comment,5029,5029,0,0,jwecker,,,"I assume the reason apps (or actually I think it's the windowing system) do this is because they assume that your grandmother will open an app and then patiently wait for it to appear, and if it accidentally appears behind another application, they'll think something is broken.  I agree, it's not the best assumption.
I happen to be using gnome a lot for my window manager and it actually very rarely gives a newly opened task the focus- I don't know if that's default though or some setting I set at some point.",1174332262
5038,comment,4950,4950,0,0,notabel,,,"This is an interesting adaptation of the notion of glogging / moblogging; I have to wonder to what extent these guys were inspired by the much more theoretical work done with eyetaps (amazing technology, but not really scalable).  The interesting thing to see will be whether, since this is meant to be outward-facing (as opposed glogging's introspective bent), it will suffer from the lack of editorial control.  Basically, does a person's life have a high enough density of interesting content that it is worth watching?  If the answer is yes, then there is definite potential for radical developments in social media.<p>\me wanders off to check Joi Ito's moblog.",1174332255

Guy believes that entrepreneurs can change the world and make it a better place. Sounds quite naive but to me a vision is much more motivating than money and trackrecords.",1174331869
5036,comment,5031,5034,0,0,pg,,,"We have no idea how much money something like YC might make long term.  VC is a well understood business, but this is completely new.  We're in the black at the moment, but not buying jets.<p>We lost money on Kiko, incidentally.  Their later stage investors got paid back, and the founders made a little, but YC got 38 cents on the dollar.",1174331851

In both cases the ad content provider is paying the medium to display the ad.  For a TV show, the provider is <i>being paid,</i> and therefore subject to the terms of sale (some shows do show on more than one network, for instance, but not until they are ""old"" episodes).<p>In the US there are even some TV stations that spend a major chunk of their time showing commercials (""infomercials"").  In these cases content is not a differentiator.<p>There are also print-based classified-ad (magazines) (Auto-Trader, for example) that don't  restrict re-using your ad.",1343991561

They made content policies that were very elitist (similar to HN in a way) emphasizing quality and trained their early adopters to vote only the VERY BEST of content.<p>They then moved away from the gated status and allowed others to enter their community. The new-comers were however not as qualified to write as the old user base and obviously most of them never got any upvotes for the content they created. So the new users got programmed to believe that up votes are scarce on quora and therefore they themselves stopped up voting on quora.<p>Well the only problem with this was, up voting also meant sharing. So by training users to not up vote in a way, they cut off their sharing. So now old content stopped circulating and that explains why most people think quora is dead.<p>To solve the problem of content circulation slowing down, which would heavily impact the discovery of content, Quora first launched a feature called 'Boards' some time back. (Even though this invited comments on how Quora is just copying pinterest).\nThat probably got the engine up and running for some while.<p>However this still did not fix the problem. I think the most popular board on Quora has something like 5000 followers. Thats it! So the content is still not circulating well.<p>So then they came up with the Views feature - a feature turned on by default and which would convert every view into a vote and could turn on their content engine back up again.<p>What people don't get is - The guy who started eHow is an investor at Quora. It has always been about long tail content, getting traffic for long queries on google, content circulation etc...<p>Quora is not innovative at all, there is no great model there.<p>Its just eHow done more cleanly.",1343989583

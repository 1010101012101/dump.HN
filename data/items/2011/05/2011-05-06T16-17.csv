The modern conference where all presentations are on the web is ideal.<p>Now if you want discussions, that's a whole different matter.  I've used PowerPoint for discussions.  Usually one slide to frame the discussion and a second slide I leave up that has the goal of the discussion -- that is, what are we here to answer.  You could just as easily do it with a printout or on a whiteboard, but a PowerPoint is often logistically easier.  The keypoint though is that a discussion should have a clear goal.

He introduced himself as the father of the plastic payment card, which he developed at IBM. It sounded to me like he wanted a seat on our Board of Directors. This seemed strange because he hadn't even signed up for the product, but I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and at least meet with him.<p>After meeting Mr. Svigals, who was quite dismissive of everything we were doing, I did some more research into his claims. He may have authored 25 books (Amazon.com lists 17 of them), but none of them are available for purchase in stores, and many are no longer in print. The vast majority are more like updated pamphlets than books, and they are mostly about smart cards. See <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_seeall_2?rh=k%3ASvigals%2Ci%3Astripbooks&keywords=Svigals&ie=UTF8&qid=1304700061"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_seeall_2?rh=k%3ASv...</a>, which have not become prevalent in the U.S. despite his predictions (which seem to go back years).<p>Mr. Svigals also did not single-handedly invent the plastic payment card, though I'm sure he played a supportive role at IBM. He has edited the Wikipedia entry on the subject to insert himself into the card's history, but it's very hard to tell if his description is accurate without independent verification from someone else at IBM at the time. As best I can tell he worked in the Asia Pacific division but was not on the core team developing the technology.<p>I wish him well, but would warn people that he has a tendency to inflate his claims, which shouldn't be necessary given all that he knows anyhow.",1304700258

Anyway, I hate this slide deck so much.<p>1. The author's point could be made in far fewer slides.  As in, like, two slides.  I hate presentations that are disrespectful of the audience's time for the sake of being cute.<p>2. I am generally unimpressed by arguments of the form:
  (a) Language X has flaw Y.
  (b) Therefore language X is unsuitable for development.
This can be instantiated for every language X for some flaw Y and is not an argument against any language.  You need to additionally make the argument:
  (c) Y is so serious that it outweighs the considerations in favor of X and against the other languages one might reasonably use.
Of course (c) is an incredibly high bar, which is why most anti-language zealot arguments do not even attempt to make it, and also why most anti-language zealotry is silly.<p>In order to do (c) in this case, you would have to make the case that writing finally clauses is worse overall than, e.g. debugging memory corruption errors, and writing copy constructors and overloaded assignment operators, and all the other baggage of C++, rather than handwaving them away with ""the downsides have been exaggerated""<i>.<p></i>Which, by the way, is ironically the biggest flaw of this slide deck: the author vastly exaggerates the downsides of finally.  try/finally is no worse than checking the result codes of C syscalls, and it is sometimes better.  I don't recall the C style of programming stopping Ken Thompson from building great things and I doubt that try/finally is actually what stops Java programmers from building great things.",1304700017

f is an opened file which is automatically closed. This isn't strictly necessary in Python, since files are flushed and closed when reaped, including in case of exception, but it's useful. You can also do this with all of the threading primitives:<p><pre><code>  with threading.Lock():
   do_that_one_contentious_thing()
</code></pre>
Useless syntactic sugar? Maybe. It's an explicit scope which makes certain guarantees, though, so it's not just fluff.<p>What was his other example? DB connections? Well, in Python, the DB API requires that DB connections not easily leak, but if you're stuck with a crappy driver, you can still auto-close your connections:<p><pre><code>  with contextlib.closing(dbapi.Connection(...)) as handle:
   cursor = handle.cursor()
   ...
</code></pre>
So it's definitely possible.<p>I think it's unfair of him to pick on Ruby and Python just because their syntax is more oriented towards assuming the garbage collector is non-sucky and exceptions aren't expensive.<p>Edit: Fixed formatting.",1304699658

The OP mixes these two radically different orders of decision making. Good and evil are not just about misprioritization of values, and most entrepreneurs are good people balancing decisions of a more practical nature, such as when to hire and when not, that don't really have moral ""right answers"".<p><i>Bad people have no problem with good values. Irreconcilable opposites are made from the same handful of values representing goodness.</i><p>As for evil vs. values, evil generally comes in two forms: fanatical and selfish evil, which may both exist in one person. Invariably, both exist in evil movements: Hitler being an example of fanatical evil and Eichmann being an example of selfish evil. OP's statement is only true (sometimes) of the latter. Fanatical evil is characterized by the insistence on one value, which may be good (economic equality, as in communism) or bad (""racial purity"", as in Nazism) at its root but is, in either case, given such an absurdly high priority over other values (humanism, reason) as to have catastrophic results.<p>Selfish evil, on the other hand, is characterized by narcissism, psychopathy, and a complete lack of values, but also a willingness to adopt the appearance of whatever values are in fashion. A selfishly evil person cares only about self-advancement.<p>The fanatical kind is what we associate with villians like Hitler and bin Laden, and it's really destructive when such people get into power. In business, it's far more common to encounter the selfish kind of evil: the office psychopath. This is because, although they're less damaging to the world, office psychopaths are just a lot more common. You can think of selfishly evil people like tornadoes, which can cause a lot of harm on a local scale but rarely globally, and fanatical evil people like hurricanes, which have a broader effect.<p>On the small scale, selfish evil is more dangerous because these people are more common and, unlike the fanatically evil who usually end up institutionalized, there are a lot of them in high positions of power and it is impossible to spot them unless one directly sees them doing bad things, because they act like anyone else. On the large scale, fanatical evil is more dangerous to the world because it's better at PR. It can dress itself up as ""virtue"" and prey on weak minds.",1304698311

I think you could do better than that, however.<p>I think the best way to show off self obtained knowledge in a resume is to turn the knowledge into experience, and list it in a ""Skills"" section of a resume. An example is to learn all about virtualization, then set up a whole lab of virtual machines and practice setting up, shutting down, managing VMs. Pure knowledge subjects like higher math is more difficult to show this way.<p>An even better way is to have projects, and list those as well.  If you leverage your coding knowledge/experience and make a web app, list that. If it's a project that they've heard of (even if it was just viral for a short period of time) that's a huge bonus. Also, committing to popular open source projects is a big way to show off that you know how to code as well.<p>While it is certainly awesome to be proud of learning and knowledge, employers want to know what you can DO, not so much what you KNOW.

Ron Conway has invested in my company. I'm using a throwaway HN account because we have not announced our investors.<p>Here's an excerpt from the email he sent to his portfolio companies:
""As you know, we are facing an uphill battle at City Hall in San Francisco, and need your help!! Right now, San Francisco is the only major city in the United States that taxes stock options, and there are two competing bills at City Hall to address the issue. One (sponsored by Supervisor Mark Farrell) would permanently stop this tax - private companies will not pay anything going forward, and existing public companies would be capped at their current levels. Another (sponsored by Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi) would only create a 6-year trial period, where public companies will still be subject to the tax, and private companies will still have to pay up to $750,000 a year once they go public.<p>We need to support Supervisor Mark Farrell's legislation --- this is VERY important to the technology community in San Francisco.""<p>If you'd like to help:
1. Email the letter below to Board.of.Supervisors@sfgov.org; mayoredwinlee@sfgov.org & BCC sfstartups@votizen.com (Votizens is keeping a tally of supporters).
2. If you're not a voter or live outside of the city, you can tweet your support with the #sfstartups hashtag.<p>---------<p>Dear Mayor Lee and Supervisors,<p>We are excited that City Hall is focusing on creating a solution to the stock options issue as a member of the technology community in San Francisco, I strongly urge you to support Supervisor Mark Farrell's stock option legislation!<p>We support Supervisor Farrell's proposal for a number of reasons:<p>1. City Hall has to create a permanent solution to the problem, or tech companies (and the jobs they create) will continue to evaluate leaving San Francisco. A temporary solution sends the message that San Francisco is not interested in creating long-term solutions for the local economy. I assume that after 6 years San Francisco won't start taxing stock options again, so why not create a permanent solution?<p>2. Private and public companies should both be treated equally - it is the only common-sense solution. Supervisor Farrell's legislation ensures that both private and public companies benefit - not only are private companies thinking about leaving San Francisco, but larger, public companies (which employ thousands of San Franciscans) are growing their employees outside of San Francisco. I want these jobs to stay in San Francisco  and Supervisor Farrells legislation will do just that.<p>3. Supervisor Farrell's legislation Insures that San Francisco's general fund will not face any additional budget deficit. City Hall won't collect more taxes on stock options, but his legislation is designed so that current levels of tax revenue from stock options will stay constant.<p>Supervisor Farrell's legislation strikes the right balance in creating incentives to keep tech companies in San Francisco, while protecting the City from adverse budget impacts. Our local economy is at stake - please focus on the long-term, and support Supervisor Farrell's legislation!!<p>Sincerely,

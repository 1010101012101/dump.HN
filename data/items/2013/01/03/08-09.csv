5001496,comment,4999406,4999865,1,0,riffraff,,,"the thing that is different is that the raw sql facilities are made explicitly available not through the common methods that expect them, but through something else.<p>The orm supports building the sql piecemeal, e.g<p><pre><code>     find(select: ""name, foo(bar) as baz"",    \n          conditions: 'x=y',\n          limit: 3)\n</code></pre>\nthis is a small step above a raw execute, and obviously ugly and low level. Also a somewhat obsolete practice, since for a few years you could write it as a composition of calls<p><pre><code>        select(""name, foo(bar) as baz"").\n          where('x=y').\n          limit(3)\n</code></pre>\nAnyway the functionality is there to compose SQL via bits using an hash of parameters, moving on.<p>Now remember that ruby <2.0 does not support keyword arguments, so the common practice is to use one normal argument with an hash value wich contains the keyword args.<p>Rails has this (antipattern imo) of accepting arguments in a dozen way for some methods e.g.<p><pre><code>    find(1)\n    find(:first)\n    find([1])\n    find(1,limit: 1)\n\n</code></pre>\nlet us not argue whether this is good, it's there.<p>And AR has dynamically generated finders (which Django does not have AFAIR).<p>One would expect the dynamically generated finder to be doing<p><pre><code>     def find_by_foo  arg\n        where(foo, arg).limit(1)\n     end\n\n</code></pre>\nbut in reality it does<p><pre><code>     def find_by_foo *args\n       many_options = args.extract_options!\n       opts = combine_with_foo_handling(many_options)\n       find(opts)\n     end\n\n</code></pre>\nand here you get the problem that you may be unknowingly passing an hash object wich builds sql piecemeal.<p>Notice that, as others already pointed out, usually as a user you shouldn't be able to create custom objects of the kind that exploits this issue (an hash with symbols as keys) unless your have other vulnerabilities already.",1357203420

5001481,comment,5000328,5001270,14,0,alexqgb,,,"This is wrong on so many levels.<p>First and foremost, the idea that ""elected representatives"" get to pick who votes for them represents the anthesis of democratically elected representation. It's like a parachute that opens on impact.<p>Your second error is thinking that gerrymandering simply seeks to place voters from each party in their own districts. What it actually aims to do is advantage one party over the other by marginalizing the other entirely. This can be the case even when the marginalized party actually represents a clear majority of the voters, as happened in the last election.<p>The third problem is that once a party controls a district exclusively, it inevitably becomes more extreme. Since there's no danger that a firebrand zealot who goes too far  will attract challenger from the other party, the contests in ""safe"" districts select for ideological purity rather that the ability to negotiate with others - which is what's actually the most important thing in people whose whole job is to identify workable compromises that both sides can live with.<p>An even more insidious effect of the ""safe"" seat is that it aligns the interests of a party and its donors against those of individual representatives and the represented. Under the current corruption-facilitating system, a politician that pisses off donors or party leadership by putting constituent's interests first can be safely challenged from within his own party without the party risking the loss of the seat. Enforcing ""discipline"" becomes a lot riskier when retaliating against a ""wayward"" member could hand the seat to the other party.<p>You're correct to note that open primaries in California have been a positive development. But you mustn't forget that they were introduced as part and parcel of a broader electoral reform effort that also ended partisan gerrymandering, first for statewide offices, then for national representatives. Of the two reforms, the end to gerrymandering was the more important, by a wide margin.<p>You may disagree, but that's just a reflection of your own limited understanding. The savviest politicians in the state (correctly) recognized and end to gerrymandering as the greatest thereat to their illegitimate power, and fought against that far harder than they opposed open primaries.<p>Of course when it comes to open primaries and an end to gerrymandering, electoral reform is not either / or. It's BOTH. And while we're at it, we need to bounce any Senators who block filibuster reform. Getting all three done together would give the people vastly more power over Congress, and by extension, the entire Federal government.",1357203033

There is an actual, real chance that he wants to push for a peaceful reunification, something that would be amazingly good for the world. If he really wanted to do that one of the huge barriers is how polarized the two states are, both in terms of attitude towards each other and in terms of existing infrastructure.

I, for instance, made no comment in this thread about proper hot spare policy.<p>About RAID-5: some major storage vendors still use it for smaller arrays. Some other don't use it anymore (NetApp, DDN come to mind). The notion that RAID-5 isn't fit for arrays of large capacity drives doesn't come from me and is hardly new. You don't need any links as obviously you know all about this already.<p>I've set up my first terabyte SAN in the 90s back when it used to fill a whole rack, 9 GB micropolis drives where hot and SSA was the new interconnect, but I probably know less about storage than <i>you</i>.",1357201240

I use the shared folders feature of VirtualBox between host and guest, I don't use scripts to sync stuff (Vagrant will be gaining support for VMWare sometime soon if I recall).<p>As far as 'hosting in the cloud goes', I just uploaded my base-boxes to my FTP server so whenever I lose the image or need it somewhere else Vagrant will just fetch it for me. Running it 'in the cloud' isn't something I feel like attempting, I prefer to be able to work regardless of a working internet connection.<p>When it comes to editors, I use Vim with a slew of plugins, most noticeably Vundle, python-mode, NerdTree, Powerline, CtrlP and syntastic (which takes care of calling syntax and style checkers when needed). Vim is available just about everywhere and with a carefully crafted .vimrc you can get the same working environment on any system so you don't have to familiarise yourself with a new set of tools every time. However, there will always be cases where you need to switch to different IDE like XCode if you're doing iOS development, or Eclipse for Java/Android.<p>Another practice I find useful, store your rc-files in something like git. Setting up a new working environment then just comes down to a `git clone` instead of mailing configuration snippets to yourself from one place to the other. You can even have platform or device specific branches that contain small changes for every environment.",1357200945

When you have that level of profit you get tremendous pressure  to give it back to shareholders via raising dividends. Plus there are increased taxes. From company's perspective that's ""throwing away"" a lot of many. So  you need to spend it out and keep your ""net"" profits low.<p>This is the core dynamics behind lot of large companies with gigantic R&D without focused goals.

I came more-or-less directly to Haxe as a better ActionScript, and had to check whether I could have done the same in AS3, and found that no, it doesn't have that keyword. I was so relieved at my language choice just then, else I would have been screwed.

If you ask me it should be folded into the Haxe standard library. One admitted difficulty I've had using the standard data structures is not really being sure what the most efficient one to use is, when even if you're sticking to one language - say JavaScript - your 'array' could really be a linked-list underneath and vice-versa, and if you're writing to make use of Haxe's cross-platformability (which I haven't yet) then God knows where you actually stand.",1357200728

The problem is that the sql injection requires a hash with symbols as key and params are stored in HashWithIndifferentAccess which should not symbolize the keys.

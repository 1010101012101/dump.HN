But for the bulk of us in the middle of the curve, it all comes down to time. The problem is society pulls for our time on one end and family pulls for our time on the other. Unless your independently wealthy you can't be uber effective at both. I've actually known a number of men who have tried to advance there careers or get advanced degrees after they were married and had children only to end up getting divorced. I'm not advocating one path as superior to the other but having a family myself I know something has to give. Over time I've learned to value my accomplishments as a husband and father over those of intellect and career.",1202493433

If he had said: ""Arc doesn't support Unicode yet but I expect it would be easy and I welcome patches"" then it would have not been an issue at all.<p>Instead, he said: ""I realize that supporting only Ascii is uninternational to a point that's almost offensive, like calling Beijing Peking, or Roma Rome (hmm, wait a minute). But the kind of people who would be offended by that wouldn't like Arc anyway.""<p>There was no reason to take a swipe at the ""kind of people"" who care about internationalization, which is to say:<p>* people who are not mono-lingual anglophones<p>* people who want to build real-world applications<p>Why shouldn't people in those categories be interested in Arc? Why should they be excluded? And why treat it as a matter of political correctness rather than just a technological decision?<p>Paul threw the first punch and the blogosphere punched back.<p>Furthermore, his general tendency to divide and conquer the programing world in that way is why there was already a huge pool of haters ready to pounce on him. Every essay of his implies that there are people who get it and people who don't and one can distinguish between them by seeing which people agree with him and which do not.<p>He only needed to say: ""Arc does not yet support Unicode"" and the whole thing would have been avoided.",1202493147

There's a large concentration of biotech companies in Bedford & Burlington by the Rt 3/128 interchange.<p>Boston is interesting in that population density declines pretty sharply as you move away from the city center.  So Boston itself has a population of 600k and skyscrapers, Cambridge has 100k and still feels fairly urban, Arlington and Lexington each have about 40k people and feel like large towns, Bedford and Concord have 15k apiece and feel like small towns, and Carlisle has 4k and feels positively rural.  I'm on an acre of land in Bedford, with woods in the back, and only 13 miles outside of Boston.<p>The northwest suburbs also don't lack cultural activities the way many suburbs do.  You've got all the historical sites in Lexington, Bedford, and Concord; the Lexington symphony orchestra; community activities; libraries in each town; band concerts; fireworks displays on July 4; etc.  I was going to say ""Flipside is that you need a car to get to them,"" but even that's not really true: a bike path connects the town centers of Bedford, Lexington, Arlington, and the Alewife subway station in Cambridge.<p>Only problem is that property values are sky-high here, though they seem to be going down fast.  The house across the street went on the market for a million, but finally sold for $630k six months later.  Houses are still going for $1M+ in Concord and Carlisle.<p>Well, that and the ""sufficiently small values of 'decent climate'"".

She HAS this position because she was the only one, who did not leave in the last 20 years. Since nobody else wants her she will stay forever.<p>- On the other hand: smart people are bored quickly. If you don't give them new challenges, THEY will leave (with few years of experience in every field they have ever touched).<p>My best guess is this: The HR departments are full of mediocre people who are not smart enough themselves to find smart people.

112170,comment,110625,111622,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""with"" is dangerous, because it makes it impossible to tell lexically whether you're assigning to an object or to a global variable.  If you mistype a variable or pass an object of the wrong type in to ""with"", you can find yourself with very difficult-to-track-down bugs.  In practice I'd only use it with a bunch of assertions, which could bloat the code significantly.<p>Chris Double suggested another alternative over on Proggit: tailcall to window.setTimeout with a delay of 0.  This is effectively a trampoline; the continuation gets pushed onto a timer, the eval function returns, then JavaScript picks up again where it should.  As a nice side effect, it gives the browser's event loop a chance to run, which eliminates any chance of locking up the machine.  Pretty elegant solution, though I'm guessing there's a significant performance penalty.",1202490200

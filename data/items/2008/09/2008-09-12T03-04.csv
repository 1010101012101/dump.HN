302083,comment,302039,302060,0,0,a-priori,,,"Just killing a process will leave its core intact in memory until the pages are reused by the operating system. If the computer is then hibernated (and by default Mac OS X writes hibernation data when you suspend it), a memory dump is written to disk that may include this data. If a process was manipulating sensitive data -- cleartext passwords, cryptographic keys, or so forth -- then that data may be persisted even after a program is killed.<p>The good thing is that, as far as I know, most operating systems use a first-in first-out page allocation algorithm. This means that newly-freed pages will be given out first, so the life-span of this ""zombie data"" will probably be short.<p>Also good news is that RAM is volatile by nature, so it doesn't store ""imprints"" like hard drives may after a write. If a byte of RAM is overwritten, all traces of the old data is gone within a few nanoseconds. This means that if you are paranoid about this sort of data leak, you should zero sensitive memory buffers before returning them to the system.<p>I know a bit about the analagous problems with hard drives, if you're interested.",1221191712

302073,comment,301853,301853,0,0,tptacek,,,"In 2003, me and a partner decided it'd be pretty neat if companies could deploy firewalls that filtered AOL Instant Messenger, Jabber, and MSN IM, with rules for users and groups, not IP addresses, and with automatic encryption and message relaying to keep corporate secrets off the OSCAR servers.<p>Then AOL announced they were going to go release the same thing. We had pretty much everything but the user interface done.<p>Like the man said, ""In a situation like this, there's a high potentiality for the common motherfucker to bitch out"". We bitched out.<p>A few months later, AOL dropped the product. Akonix and IMlogic, two companies that <i>didn't</i> bitch out, went on to gross something like 30-40MM in revenue each. I stopped paying attention to them; I assume they exited nicely.<p>Your competitors don't decide whether you're going to succeed. Your judgement and execution do. We probably would have failed even if we kept moving --- our hearts weren't in it. Is yours? If you have to ask whether you're going to keep going, maybe you should do something else.",1221190716

302070,comment,302025,302025,0,0,aristus,,,"The current consensus is to use statistics without trying to write a program that ""understands"" human language.<p>A common approach is to break your items down into a vector of ""features"" (words, phrases, tokens, etc) and apply standard IR techniques like kNN, singular value decomposition (SVD), tf/idf, etc.<p>One interesting thing about your problem is that people use different words and phrasing for the same thing, which means you need a way to equate different tokens with each other. SVD is pretty good because it finds degrees of similarity based on context: 'Pikachu' becomes strongly associated with 'Pokemon' and 'Squirtle', and also with misspellings like 'Picachoo'. SVD is tricky and expensive if you implement it wrong. The good news is that it recently came off-patent so there are a lot of new  libraries popping up.<p>When I worked on a keyword search engine prototype for Brasil, I found that a mix of Tanimoto and Ferber similarity scores worked <i>very</i> well for finding similarity between short phrases, and I didn't even need to know how to read Portuguese.<p>PressFlip is using support vector machines for a similar task of clustering news items. The Vowpal Wabbit is a stellar library used by Yahoo. I think they recently open-sourced it. allvoices.com is tackling the same area as well.

Secondarily it also gives puts them in a prime position within the functional programming niche in case it does catch on and is likely to become the first choice in production environments.

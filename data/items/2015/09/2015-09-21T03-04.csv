How anyone could honestly defend cross-site targeted ads is beyond me. Do they improve anyone&#x27;s browsing experience? Do they honestly make all that much money for the sites that run them? For the businesses that pay for them?&quot;<p>Very important question I don&#x27;t see asked a lot. Of course there was an article a while back that suggested that it would get way worse before it got better.<p>I find it really disturbing that Mozilla sides with this view that ads make the web possible. Who can blame them? They owe pretty much the majority of thier early funding and promotions to Google who was getting referrals in exchange. So the hard truth is Mozilla used and still uses ads to fund Firefox development.<p>Could they have thrived without doing referrals? Would the web be worse off if they never took off? Would the world be worse off if the Web stagnated? Who could know?",1442807961

Open standards tend to trump closed platforms over time. If this is the case it presents an opportunity to create a new open version of what Apple is doing now.

Ideally you would have someone that does both well, or is stronger on managing down.

All of these security features rely on trusting something, and people need to have control over that. Maybe they have reason to distrust one of the CAs (China and their effort to catch people circumventing the Great Firewall is an obvious example), and so it should be easier for people to manage these important trust choices.<p>An interesting (and probably good) side-effect might be that market forces put pressure on websites/etc about their choice of CA. That is, if people distrust a CA an &quot;break&quot; websites that it signed, that&#x27;s a good thing as it lets the market punish shady CAs indirectly.<p>We really need a simple way for for someone to browse the trust choices and easily say &quot;I don&#x27;t trut the government of $COUNTRY, disable all of their certs&quot; or &quot;Use these trust settings that my friend gave me on this $PHYSICAL_MEDIA&quot; or &quot;I trust $SOME_3RD_PARTY, use their recommended list&quot;.

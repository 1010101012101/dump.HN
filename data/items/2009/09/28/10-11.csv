How big do you need to be? How homogeneous does your market need to be? Is it always better to go for brand recognition, or are there situations where direct marketing is more effective? Etc etc...<p>I'd love some follow-up articles answering these questions.",1254135044

848170,comment,846754,846947,0,0,btilly,,,"This argument was originally due to Malthus, and was used by the English to justify not helping the Irish during the Irish Potato Famine.  Shortly thereafter improvements in agriculture made it clear that Europe could sustain much, much larger populations.<p>The specter of mass famine from population growth was popular in the 60s.  Predictions then focused on India.  But improvements in agriculture resulted in calories/capita improving 23% from 1960 to 2000 despite a doubling in population.<p>Given historical precedent and ongoing improvements in agriculture (many of which have not taken hold in Africa yet), is it morally sound to repeat the failed argument today?  Besides which, the biggest cause of famine today is political strife, not carrying capacity.  To pick a random example, Ethiopia was a net <i>exporter</i> of food during the famous famines there in the 1980s.  The famines occurred in a region called Eritrea that was undergoing a civil war, and were supported by the government as a way of weakening the resistance.<p>And finally around the world we are finding that population growth is faster among poor people than rich.  So helping people attain a decent standard of living seems to be a more effective method of population control than encouraging them to starve themselves to death.",1254134745

5589027,comment,5585211,5586870,1,0,SapphireSun,,,"(I am only addressing the US).<p>Price shopping happens when the payer is directly affected by the costs (note: you mentioned your mother is uninsured) and when you can evaluate the quality (or don't care). It's actually very difficult to evaluate who's good and who isn't because a) statistics aren't often released (because hospitals and doctors block them) and b) the statistics can be difficult to interpret (a good doctor with bad stats can just have a sicker overall population). A big problem was that the data capture to adjust for these factors wasn't there (records were frequently kept on paper and billing codes barely correspond to reality). A big problem has been simply that even when the data was there, it is incredibly expensive to aggregate and report it.<p>In the US, we are attempting to fix some of these things. Medicare has implemented Quality Metrics and the requirement that doctors implement electronic medical record systems that measure some of the easier things to measure (patient counseled about managing diabetes, summary slip issued at end of visit, et cetera). Hopefully, price transparency plus a modern statistical reporting system will result in price shopping being viable in the next decade (of course the patient must be willing to discriminate).",1366634986

5589023,comment,5586519,5588370,3,0,tptacek,,,"Responses in reverse order.<p>First: IPv6 is not the smallest possible change. IPv6 is a very large change, involving an infrastructure upgrade and software upgrades across the Internet. Overlay networks necessitate neither. Routers on the Internet can at the beginning remain ignorant of new overlays. Endpoints add software as and when they decide to participate in a specific overlay. Meanwhile, the existing IPv4/HTTP service model, which works just fine under NAT, continues to operate. This is a more incremental approach than IPv6 and thus by definition a smaller set of changes.<p>Second: NAT demonstrably doesn't harm the interests of most Internet users, because a huge fraction of satisfied Internet users are already NAT'd. But if you believe Internet user interests are harmed by NAT, you also must believe they're harmed by IPv4, which has no functioning multicast or workable group messaging and has a security model designed in the '70s. At this point, arguing for a NAT-less Internet is <i>de facto</i> an argument for a massive software upgrade. If we're going to upgrade, let's upgrade to something better than IPv6.<p>Finally: we already have hoarding. It's just hoarding of fiat allocations.",1366634949

Part of that is down to sheer popularity. Watterson is worth several hundred million dollars according to reports, whereas Munroe likely makes at most a few hundred k a year. Which is still very respectable, but not quite in the ""fuck it, I'm retiring"" impulse zone as Watterson's wealth is. Also, Watterson was fairly disconnected from his fans and the primary interaction of his work were the ongoing struggles with his syndicate masters. Whereas Munroe's main interaction related to his work is directly with his fans, which also directly provide his income (through merch sales, mostly).<p>So there's very much less reason for Munroe to get frustrated with the process and stop. Watterson got tired of the bullshit and decided he'd had enough.

I think you're being a bit disingenuous. While the protocol itself is relatively simple to understand, the complexity related to its implementation is immense which is why we're still talking about it and not fully doing it.<p>Why it's complex:<p>1. The recommended approach is dual-stack. This means that network admins/system administrators will essentially have to manage two separate networks. Of course, this is assuming you have core-to-edge IPv6 support. If not, then you're upgrading all of your hardware.<p>2. Cost. Predominantly why we're still here. Often easy for us to push aside in our cosy developed world, but ignores an enormous number of legacy hardware deployed all over the world that will simply not work and, quite frankly, the solutions like tunnelling read a lot like the supposed pitfalls of IPv4.<p>3. Training. It's not a matter of a few FAQ's to learn, for a lot of technicians it is a matter of re-certification as all hardware has to be replaced which likely means new operating systems and firmware, proxying/tunnelling servers/devices ala Teredo/ISATAP.<p>For anyone that says it's a ""no-brainer"", I say that you have little to no experience in managing large heterogenous networks in cost-strapped organizations which, up until now, have had little to no reason to upgrade as the IPv4 address exhaustion issue does not really affect them (yet).",1366634127

5588915,comment,5588375,5588375,5,0,mistercow,,,"Since CoffeeScript started supporting literate programming, I've enjoyed dabbling with it quite a lot. I wrote a program to generate a recipe for a variant on the ""soylent"" concept, using numeric.js to solve and optimize for various constraints based on a target nutritional profile. The goal of that was rather close to what TFA is discussing; I had previously computed the recipe by hand, realized later that my calculations were wrong, and decided to build the recipe as a well-documented reproducible computation instead of an opaque final result.<p>But what I have not found yet (or discovered for myself) is good guidance on how to document larger blocks of code. If a function is more than a few lines long, I haven't found a satisfactory way to document it.<p>The first approach I tried was not to respect the atomicity of the function in terms of formatting. That is, I would just write along literately about what the function was doing, right inside the function. The problem is that in both the code and the generated documentation, it becomes very difficult to discern scope visually.<p>The second approach I tried was to give a brief overview description above the function, then include ordinary comments inside it. That's fine and all, but at that point, you're not gaining much over simple block comments above the function.<p>The third approach I've tried is to either use an ordered list of steps preceding the function, or to describe the function with numbered footnotes, and then to add corresponding numeric comments in the code. This is the most satisfactory solution I've found yet, and the documentation ends up looking like a programming book. But the locality of reference is just terrible. It's also just terrible for control flow statements. Using an outline format instead of an ordered list can allow for a bit better control flow, but it's still not great.",1366632860

Of the 37 analysts from major securities firms who follow Apple, none has downgraded the stock to a sell, according to available data from MSN.com. But 25 of them still recommend the stock as a strong buy and six others rate it as moderate buy. Another six Apple watchers rate the stock as a hold.<p>One of the chief reasons why these analysts continue to favor the stock is Apples huge cash pile, estimated at more than $137 billion, and what the company could do with it to win back the thickening crowd of disappointed and displeased investors. And strong demand for Apples innovative products has continued, led by the iPhone and iPad. And speculation persists that soon Apple will announce another new must-have product, which should help the stock recoup its sharp decline.</i><p>So essentially, despite no good reasons for the price to drop, the stock price is dropping because analysts are afraid the stock price is dropping regardless of what the company is actually doing. Now, because of that, those same analysts want to get rid of the CEO that basically engineered Apple's ability to make ridiculous margins on through their operating systems efficiency.

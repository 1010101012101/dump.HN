3040238,comment,3039873,3039873,12,0,dr_rezzy,,,"For me, this blog post represents a step backwards. They open up saying that the 1 hour interview provides absolutely no indication of how well a prospective candidate will perform. Hopefully most people will agree here. Then they go ahead and state that their staple interview will be an on the spot problem solving screening and then list the steps the expect the candidate to take in solving said problem. What does this say about their own problem solving skills? I will leave this upto the reader. Let me throw an alternative out. Why don't you give a prospective candidate a written test/problem and give them as much time as they want, using methods and environments they are comfortable with, and have them return to you a solution of their choosing. Wouldn't this best capture how a person breaks down a problem, solves it, and finally presents a solution? Leave the onsite to better understand someones personality, likableness, and workability. Maybe even ask them to walk you thru how they came up with the solution and how they worked the problem. The options here are plentiful.",1317063547

It's difficult to convey over the internet, and still challenging in person. It's the kind of skill that requires someone present to point out when you're being mindful and when you become distracted. You can't force someone else to be mindful. Hell, you can't force yourself to be mindful. Many stories disguise lessons of mindfulness.<p>Fear and dealing with fear is the biggest example. All fear roots back to existential fear. Some (not all) older people have a peculiar attitude because they see their own demise coming, accept it, and live on. The TV show, <i>Breaking Bad</i> is a great example, a man who saw the end of his existence, stripped away all the BS and decided to leave behind a legacy.<p>However, it's one thing to watch characters on the screen deal with fear, and quite another to deal with your own. The mind plays many tricks to comfortably avoid fear. Another person in the same room witnessing your discomfort has significant impact; if they are able to mindfully witness and convey a sense of safety, such interaction helps you gain insight about your fear, and possibly change habits and actions resulting from that.<p>""The pace at which technological change is happening has certainly increased since the industrial revolution, and I presume that has been a major driver of cultural change as well.""<p>Though off-topic, you might find this interesting: <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-...</a><p>Venkat's blog post led me to a book, <i>Lever of Riches</i> ... which I think has a lot of useful insights yet seriously flawed. But, it is interesting as a survey of technological history and look at changes within culture as well. I did not know, for example, that clockwork mechanisms reached high art <i>before</i> the invention of moveable type. These clockwork mechanisms directly paved the way for industrialization, and accounts for the obsession some cultures have for gadgets and gadget making.<p>I've also asked this series of questions on Quora. Perhaps you might have some insights:<p>""How has the invention of moveable type accelerated the tempo of invention and innovation?""

I'll think about this.<p>As a distraction, I offer this story. Japan has a cultural value in which the elders (now mostly from the WWII generation) believe that they can and should sacrifice themselves for the future generation, the children. It's a sort of a, strange mix of <i>bushi</i> and Confucian values. Another interesting thing: the Japanese Shinto values of spirit <i>ex machina</i> leads to a great obsession with robots and androids ... and exoskeletons to help the rice farmers continue growing rice. Because many of the younger generation do not want to farm. There's big problems with social recluses.<p>Yet, I have also read reports of the attitudes of the generation just now entering ... post-high school. Unlike their older siblings (about half a generation older), they ... don't quite outright reject their boomer parents workoholic attitude, yet don't seem to run and hide away in a closet.

Early on, I made the mistake of thinking of interview questions more as homework problems from college where there was often only one type of data structure or algorithm involved in a problem.  That's good when teaching a single concept, but real-world problem are more complex. My advice is to find problems that use multiple structures or concepts together and study and code those.<p>Also, learn to code the basics so well that you can do them by hand on a basic text editor or whiteboard.  Get so good at it that you can write code that has a very good chance of running if it were actually compiled/run.  I found that it's very different to code on a whiteboard than it is in an IDE or text editor.  When my first interview came up, I struggled to write down things with a dry-erase that would have taken me seconds on-screen.<p>One strategy that I liked to see an employer use was homework.  That might make some job seekers cringe, but gave me a chance to write real code like I would for a job.  It was also a filter for how badly I wanted a job.  There were jobs I didn't complete the homework for just because the location or employer wasn't something I was genuinely interested in.<p>I did homework for the position I landed and they did a code review as part of my interview.  It went well, because I got to see how my future co-workers would handle giving feedback, and some comfort on my end that this employer actually cared enough to do code reviews.",1317062742

3040167,comment,3038926,3039613,4,0,kragen,,,"Yes, a trie sort is one kind of radix sort.  However, a trie is very far from minimal memory usage.  Minimal memory usage for 300 000 (USA) phone numbers is about 1.5 megabytes, 5 bytes per number.  A straightforward Patricia trie in C on a 32-bit machine is going to need minimally 16 bytes per number, about three times as much, 4.5 megabytes.  If you're boxing each number, that's going to double your memory usage.<p>I think he has an order-of-magnitude error: he says the 3600 was paging continuously because it was ""reading a 30 megabyte file into VM"", but 30 megabytes / 300k phone numbers is 100 bytes per phone number, which seems like a lot for a text file full of phone numbers.  I think he had 3 million phone numbers, ten or eleven bytes each, so 30 or 33 megabytes, so building a naive trie in memory on a 64-megabyte machine is not going to work.<p>If you wanted to sort a 30-megabyte file of 3 million phone numbers, a machine with four 9-track tape drives, no disk, and a kilobyte or so of memory would be able to do it in 22 passes over the tapes.  (Practically you'd probably need at least 12 kilobytes.)  On 1970-era tape drives, running at 1.25 megabytes per second, each pass would take a little under a minute.<p>From the fact that the 64-megabyte RISC machine ran at 50 MIPS and was considered capable of handling ""massive data sets"", I'm guessing this anecdote dates to about 1992, plus or minus 2 years, which means that the machine in question probably had about a 5-megabyte-per-second SCSI disk and maybe a shared ten-megabit Ethernet.  Without doing any nifty compression or anything, on a machine like that, you could easily read thirty one-megabyte chunks off the disk, sorting each one in memory before writing it to a temp file, and then merging the thirty one-megabyte chunks in a second pass.  This is not too far from what GNU sort or Unix sort would have done, and it would have used a total of 120 megabytes of disk transfer, about 24 seconds.  That is, it would have been CPU-limited, not I/O-limited.  And you could have even done it in MIT Scheme, which was perfectly capable of reading a megabyte of numbers into memory even in 1990.",1317062492

In my opinion, it should be another company that you'd like to work at but don't covet. If that doesn't work for you, a technical or even a non-technical friend could play the role of interviewer (you'll have to give the non technical friend questions!). Nerves have been a giant issue for me in interviews - and this has significantly helped.<p>* Calm down as much as you can and forgive yourself when you make errors.

3040103,comment,3039083,3039654,2,0,viscanti,,,"I think a lot of it depends on the problem space.  Are you solving a problem that uses a B2B or B2C solution (or a hybrid)?  B2C problems are likely easier to find early adopters, if the problem is of any significance.  You likely already have friends who face that problem and would be happy to be an early adopter.  For those situations, you just reach out to your social circle and can work from there.<p>I think more work is required for B2B solutions.  Linkedin and Facebook probably already have several groups dedicated to the general topic your solution falls under.  It's not too difficult to identify people there who are pushing the boundaries of your problem area.  These are the low-hanging fruit for finding early adopters.  I think networking events, especially if there's a meetup.com group in your area, that are specific to your problem area can be a great place to get some face time with people who might be early adopters.  From there, it's a matter of setting up some coffee meetings and talking to those potential early adopters in more depth.<p>Some people like to throw up a landing page with a form to collect email addresses, then throw money at some ads to drive traffic and see if anyone is willing to send their contact info.  I think that strategy has it's merits, but I think you lose something by automating the process at that time.  I think there's a lot of benefit from the early face time with potential early adopters.  I think you can find out a lot more about who might fit the profile of an early adopter, by actually finding out what an early adopter looks like.",1317061448

You threaten to reduce it if they're impolitic enough to pursue certain courses. You make this fairly clear to them. The actual decisions come from the BBC's own leadership, acting on such knowledge.<p>> An government inquiry into the BBC's reporting would be even worse, as it would be a clear violation of the BBC's independence.<p>Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose. The only independence the BBC can have under its funding model is if it decided to risk going downhill and no longer being able to do the good things it's doing now. A reduction in license fees would accomplish that, meaning if you can wave that stick around the BBC will waive its independence and allow investigations.",1317060350

Testing a single url with ab gives you different kind of information that is more artificial compared to the overall function of a site, but sometimes it may be the data that you are looking for.  You can achieve this also with siege.  Older versions of siege seem to keepalive connections not working...from the man ""# TRIPLE CAUTION: don't use keep-alives until further notice"" and if you find that you need to test with keep-alives you are back to ab.

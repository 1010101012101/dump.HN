How bout just trying it out?<p>From the article: ""If you have a question about what you should do code it up, let people use it, and see which alternative gives you the results you want."" <p>Love it.

Our entire mission is to create products and services that cater to the double bottom-line of social impact and profitability. We're working on a NASDAQ for the non-profit world to help NGOs raise financing a lot easier. There are no real capital markets in the non-profit world--everything is basically hand-to-mouth donations. We think a non-profit ""stock"" exchange could really change the way the US funds innovation in the social sector.<p>If you, or anyone else is interested in Doing Good while Doing Well, feel free to email me:<p>neil dot abraham @ altruistiq dot com<p>Sorry for what may seem like a plug...but this thread is all about trying to create true impact with your work, and I really would love to get in touch with like minded people on this subject. As someone else mentioned, we've been creating products for the richest 1% for way too long. There are 4 billion people living on $2 a day that we can impact with our skills and talents. <p>Let's get together and see how we can create real change.",1190303252

57440,comment,57314,57314,0,0,tx,,,"Nice post. My advice for any college grad is to stay away form this stinky industry. I wasted two years out of college on billing systems with 1,500 Oracle tables with endless dumbest PL/SQL data-pumping procedures and dumbest data entry client software written in VB. <p>And nobody really cared about quality or efficiency. No algorithms, nothing even remotely interesting from a technical standpoint. Only schedule, ""feature list"" and annoying salespeople who kept selling features we did not even built. I hear that VB got replaced by Java now. And that is true: to keep those piles of shitty code running clients had to buy ""service contracts"".<p>We had a guy whose full time job was to write report generators. Ugghh...<p>It's not ""software"". It's ""software porn"".

His posts about ""harm of exceptions"" (he prefers -1 as a return code), about ""mistake of .NET"" and, from relatively recent ones, about poor Ruby performance do not make him look good as a hacker in my opinion.<p>Besides, he never really was a programmer. If I remember correctly he started his career as a program manager at Microsoft.<p>He's great as a general technology trends observer and I find his thoughts on business side of software crafting immensely useful, bug a hacker?

57431,comment,57298,57298,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"Of course these start-ups are utterly meaningless, but most businesses are. Successful businesses organize resources with the very narrow goal of accumulating as much wealth as possible. It is very selfish. As far as I can tell, no one has made a fortune seeking enlightenment. <p>But, there is nothing wrong with money and there is nothing wrong with power. It is natural to want and to pursue them. Both increase your reproductive value. If there is one concrete meaning of life, that is it. <p>We are all, to varying degrees, concerned with the people around us. This is natural. Our concern for others decreases as their connection to us decreases. For example, I am more concerned about the welfare of my family, than the welfare of an arbitrary family in the Sudan. This is natural as well. But, I am nonetheless highly motivated to help the suffering no matter how far removed. It looks like you are too Shooter. I'd gamble most of the people here feel the same. <p>You are dead right. The people in this community are probably some of the best suited to solve a lot of the world's problems. Most of us are highly technically proficient and many of us, most importantly, have the good fortune of being born with an aptitude for innovation. Being ""smart"" isn't nearly enough to be a successful founder or to solve these important problems. Doctors are smart. Lawyers are smart. But most people -- most smart people included -- don't seems have the aptitude to have a lot of new thoughts. It looks like you do. I looks like a lot of people her do. <p>So, go find problems and solve them. You need to, because no one else can. <p>I am studying Chemical Engineering and Applied Artificial Intelligence. I hope to study Pharmacology after my undergraduate work. Like everyone, I want to save the world. So, I'm going to see what I can do. <p>But along the way if I build a nifty web application and make a comfortable living, I would not complain. <p>Now (in addition to my shamelessly selfish startup), I am working on several projects that I think can do a lot of good. If any of you want to help, please contact me (<a href=""http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01SIklk3SJAk4XQZrRCmiJTw==&c=9MGVmoEYb4OxpLN237h8kf6mqDPiDF1P_SfgaCJmv8k="" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01SIklk3SJAk4XQZrRCmiJTw==...</a> ). <p>I joined the Engineers Without Borders group at my school. I was pretty excited. I thought we were going to save the world. But, I found the group was full of completely helpless people who have, after 2 years, yet to engineer anything. So, I found a project and recruited a team from outside the organization. We set out to design a composting toilet that could work in cold climates. It was pretty frustrating, because no matter how perfect the design was it would require expensive foreign components (like solar panels or small wind turbines) and the solution only prevents the spread of disease when implemented on a large scale. Eventually, I developed an alternative that can be built entirely from local materials. We are finishing the design and hope to built a prototype this December in Peru. This design looks promising and if implemented on a large scale will reduce the spread of waste borne disease like cholera and dysentery. These diseases primarily kill children, long before they have to worry about cancer or aids. (If any of you decimillionaires are interested,  contributions to our composting team through EWB are tax deductible and you can read more about the project at <a href=""http://pewb.wetpaint.com/page/Cold+Composting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pewb.wetpaint.com/page/Cold+Composting</a>.)<p>[[edit: I know it looks so simple that it can't possibly be smart. But, No one is doing anything like this. No one has done anything like this. And the world needs it. ]]<p>We are also developing an inexpensive, distributed sensor network for electrical grids in developing countries that will help reduce theft and downtime. This is nearly complete.<p>We are also developing an inexpensive watch that will make the distribution of complicated AIDS medication to developing, illiterate communities more practical. We are making good progress.<p>Find a problem and fix it. God knows you can. ",1190301736

57428,comment,57298,57298,0,0,asdf333,,,"So it seems like there are two questions here:
1. All said and done, when one is about to die, do you look back on your contributions to society and say ""yes I am glad I did that, even at the expense of not being with my family as much as I should have been"". Or do you say ""despite all that, I wish I spent more time with my own family and kids"" It sounds like this profs answer is the latter. It is humbling since death seems to be such a ultimate leveller. He has certainly led a 'special' life, spending many years in research contributing to the pool of knowledge for humanity, yet at the end, it is almost like he rediscovered what was more important was something very simple and had nothing to do w/ ""the world"" or ""humanity"". It was just his family. <p>This is slightly disturbing for me, since I want to make a difference in the world and I do think its important to my life. Will I look back one day, on my deathbed as he is, and discard all of my contributions (or attempts at contributions) as worthless and readily trade it in for just a few more moments with my family? Will i then be overcome with regret that I sacrificed so much to pursue something that meant so little to me? It does give me pause. Perhaps some of my friends, who are not trying to do so much, are the ones who really understand the meaning of life. <p>2. Changing careers and giving back
On the career side, I agree w/ you. Staying in your circle is the best. I have also come to the conclusion that the best way I can help the world is through entrepreneurship and business. I'm not talented enough to do research. One day I hope to be able to support a professorship for some talented maverick professor who has game changing ideas for humanity but is not 'fundable' by government programs. <p>I did a successful startup that got acquired by a larger company, and we do software to allow businesses to get better feedback from customers. ""Whats world changing about that"" you might say, but the way I talk about it with my customers and my coworkers is that ""if we do our job right, we are changing the strategy of these multi billion dollar corporations by allowing them to make what their customers want. This touches millions of people in the products/services they have available to them"". <p>I know, its not like we found the cure for aids. We did not solve global warming. (Definitely a big concern of mine) But we are here at work. And we are here doing this job. Lets make it meaningful, do the best we can, and see if we can't help in whatever small way instead of lamenting how we are not doing x or y.  Maybe this will not be enough for me 2 years down the road. But for me, feeling my spine tingle as I explain how much impact our product can have is enough to keep me going for now. ",1190301544

57426,comment,57298,57298,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I would ask yourself a few honest questions if I were you.<p>1) Do you want to change the world, really? Or do you just want to feel good? Lots of people have spent lots of money on eliminating poverty. And it's still here. That's not saying it's a lost cause, only that the benefit for all those other people was that it made them feel like they were trying. One day we will succeed. Until then, the numbers look like a long-shot.Same goes for a lot of other feel-good type investments: curing hunger, curing cancer, eliminating oppression, etc.There's a huge multi-billion-dollar industry built up around making rich people feel better by writing checks. It's a noble cause, if that's your thing.<p>2) Are you smart enough to know what to do? The beauty of capitalism is that progres chases benefit: you don't make money for _not_ helping people, if only a little bit. Now you can take the profit factor out, but then you've got a charity, not a business. Businesses have to provide value.<p>3) Isn't the best thing you can do is provide man-hours? In your example, you ask if use by 1% of people in the richest country a good moral choice. Let's say the toy saves an hour each week. That's 4 million people, saving one hour a week,in the richest country in the world. Assuming $40 per hour, You've roughly created $8 Billion in time for those people. Maybe 95% of that time will be spent playing Donkey Kong, watching American Idol, or picking their nose. Still, you've got $400 Million in return for what? A few hundred grand or a mil or two? And those 5% will spend their time doing things they are passionate about that _they_ feel will make a difference.<p>So if you're still feeling guilty, target some investment money in saving time for scientists -- all scientists. If you could save them a few hours each week, imagine how much value you could add?<p>So yes, time-saving toys for rich, productive people are the best use of my time that I can see. Perhaps other see it differently.",1190300618

The conversation ended at ""well, you need to buy a Mac, first.""<p>The costs are pretty high, even by North American standards. My first computing system cost less than $200, I think. Getting started with iPhone development will set one back $1500.",1261842569

My friend, blood shaking my heart	 
The awful daring of a moment's surrender	 
Which an age of prudence can never retract	 
By this, and this only, we have existed	 
Which is not to be found in our obituaries	 
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider	 
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor	 
In our empty rooms.",1261842294
1016013,comment,1015879,1015879,0,0,meunierc,,,"When he bought a computer, I asked my grandpa to show me how it worked.  He said it wouldn't be interesting to me: it was all in English (which I didn't speak or read), and there was nothing more than letters and numbers to see, on a green and black screen.  I told him that didn't matter.  He took a book and we spent an afternoon typing Rabbit.BAS into the machine, then we played some.<p>That was 30 years ago this year, today I design aircraft simulators and automated test systems for aircraft computers.  The methodology has never changed: aim high, with a goal you will enjoy a lot.<p>edit: to your second question, I have this to offer: there's nothing more I wish I had known when I started.  I'm actually very glad I didn't consider theoretical questions too early.  ""Programming"" is no different a language than Spanish, Japanese or Russian (maybe a tad more formal).  To program you need to learn to give directives to a machine.  Designing a system is something else, which uses a completely different skill set, and the entry point to that is being able to talk to the machine.<p>So my only advice could be: if you really want to be a hard-core computer nerd, stay with ""programming"" for 7-10 years, then learn (at least at overview level) all the important design principles.  You'll then be able to choose according to your personality.",1261842273
1016012,comment,1015879,1016005,0,0,Miky,,,"What's sad about that is that the iPhone is a lot harder to develop for, so it will get a lot less people interested. Rather than just opening up the ""iPhone-Basic"" app and fiddling around for a bit with an exceedingly simple and easy-to-learn language, you have you get a Mac, get registered, get XCode, and spend quite a while learning Objective-C and Cocoa, and to actually draw anything on the screen, probably OpenGL ES as well.",1261842089

I outsourced dev for my first startup (which I started my Junior year) and it failed miserably. Small fixes took days. Terrible freaking way to start a startup.<p>Anyways I started with HTML/CSS then moved up to LAMP (yes I know rails is awesome, but hey, I just started coding =)).

Considering a lot of these have the model of a compiled language, this makes it much easier for a designer to work with. The only real problem I have is that it was made pretty heavyweight with the framework they included.<p>One really cool feature would be automatic CSS sprite generation. Add a ""mixin"" background-sprite, read in the image, suck up all the others as sprites and generate the final CSS and image file.",1261841926

He or she will be sitting near a gate, in uniform...trying to shut out the noise of thousands of passengers walking by and hundreds of public address announcements.</i><p>It seems like a quick-and-easy solution would be to have the Pilots' union demand access to the airline's network lounges (or better yet, make it an FAA requirement so that they can get into off-brand lounges at smaller airports) in their next collective agreement. Union members would commit to not taking advantage of the free food or the computer terminals, and the airlines would in exchange let them hang out there as it's quieter and gives them somewhere to get a bit restful before their next leg.<p>And if the airlines don't want to fill up their own lounges with free staff (as opposed to passengers), contract out the problem - give the pilots PriorityPass memberships, so they'd be going into lounges that aren't their own, and that are explicitly OK with people paying to get in.",1261839847

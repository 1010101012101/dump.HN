Scholasticism went out of favor in part because proving things based on the assumption that Aristotle or the Bible is correct does not help once you question the source.  And arguments based on the definition of ""is"" are also built on a shaky foundation.<p>Keep pulling and you have two options. You can base things on what you observe, which leads to science, or what you on things you assume which leads no where when others don't agree to the same assumptions.  It's only when people have the same assumptions that you can have really interesting discussions such as Math or a good logic puzzle.",1247831731

709691,comment,709523,709577,0,0,alextp,,,"I have to disagree. I do a lot of pseudo-philosophical and non-philosophical arguing (my s.o. is a philosophy student), and I've realized that, as years have gone by and I've gotten better at this type of discussion, the best first step is to precisely define what each word is assumed to mean in that context and then proceed to arguing what does that mean to the topic at hand.<p>As a counter example, I was greatly unnerved the other day at watching a bar discussion between two friends that revolved on whether or not one could make money daytrading. Friend A said ""obviously you can't, the market is random"", while friend B insisted that ""well, with mathematics you can predict the way it will go"". This went on for hours (I refused to join) while they both had clearly very different meanings for the words ""random"", ""luck"" and ""mathematics"". I believe that, had they stopped early enough to define those terms, they wouldn't have argued.<p>Of course, sometimes the discussion is specifically about the definition of a few key words. Even then, I find what really helps is agreeing on some restricted definitions for other ""primitive"" words and using those primitives to build up definitions for the words in question. For example, person A could argue that selfishness is actually a form of blindness, while person B insists that it is not really so, and one can be selfish while seeing what others are doing. This way they can argue, by having pre-defined what ""blind"" ""see"", etc mean in this context.<p>Discussions about the meaning of words are easily just philosophical traps where one person says A and the other hears B.",1247831489

709685,story,,,8,3,ErrantX,"Tell HN: Passwords (and obscuring them)",,"So after the discussions a week or more ago I got interested in one assertion that was regularly made:<p><pre><code>  unobscured password entry boxes would encourage users to enter longer passwords
</code></pre>
This seemed like a big claim to make with no proof. On one hand it is a strong argument for opening up password input (especially upon first entry) - but if false it is a strong argument against.<p>I devised a small test which presented visitors with a survey. Each person got a short survey (which was irrelevant) and then were asked for a password and username. Some people recieved obscured fields, others open fields. To add spice they were also randomly given a short piece of text explaining what makes a good password (so there are 4 combinations: obscured, obscured with hints, unobscured, unobscured with hints).<p>Im still analysing the results and hope to post some insights on my blog soon. But I thought the initial impression would interest HN first.<p>The first thing to note is that people were amazingly suspicious of it. Encouragingly so. I dont mean people visiting from here (I think I got less than 10 entries via the HN submission - almost all of which were a variation ""haha nice try"" as the passwor).<p>But several people who I would consider low skilled computer users found it suspicious and emailed me asking WTF?<p>At first take up was slow (because it looked like a phishing attack) but once I posted a blog post explaining in a bit more detail things picked up. Also I posted to a couple of communities where I am well known in person (and trusted, I think). They proved great sources of new passwords (as they actually read the intro :)) - and were more successful in convincing friends to try it out.<p>In the end I have managed about 6500 results. Over half of these I would say are joke or other random entry so I discarded them (this was subjective - but I went with things like ha ha).<p>I also discarded common nonsense passwords. Of these variations on bobo/bobbob was the MOST common username/password combination). It's a wierd thing - at one point 4 people in a row entered pretty much the same thing.<p>Right so onto the data. Im first to admit this is a VERY rough shod way to do this (im devising a better test based on this one's feedback) but I think the results are of interest.<p>Firstly the pages including password hints tended to actually encourage shorter passwords (average length was 6.36 chars compared to 7.84 chars). But what it did do was encourage more varied passwords. Passwords with hints given on the entry page generally had more numbers, had the word jumbled or used caps MORE than pages with no hints.<p>Both unobscured and obscured pages with no hints exhibited roughly the same complexity in password (though there was a tendancy for unobscured boxes to use capitals more often). The biggest result was in length. Obscured password boxes not only generated longer passwords (on average) than unobscured - the unobscured boxes also generated a LOT more ""junk"" (asdfd for example). The inference seems to be that ""trust"" also became an issue - where the obswcured box felt more secure.<p>Finally the feedback was interesting; overwhelmingly the people I talked to said they found an unobscure password box worrying.<p>One comment I found summed up the ocerriding feeling (that unobscured <i>feels</i> wrong but they can see the uses in some cases):<p><i>hiding it makes me feel more secure, i mean if a site cant be bothered to secure the password entry box god knows what the back-end is like [Wink]<p>however i have lost count of the amount of times i incorrectly enter my windows password while unlocking my computer [Tongue] being able to see what i type in would stop that but it would only save a few seconds</i><p>Ok, so none of this is conclusive or even really usable to draw a full analysis - but i think the results are worth enough to say: <i>it looks like unobscuring password boxes might not have as big an impact as suggested</i>.<p>Comments?",1247830954

Thanks for being willing to post drafts, etc...<p>It seems that a lot of cities/regions want to start tech incubators as a means of boosting the local economy.  A number of cities that I've lived in want to start a ""Silicon Prarie"" or a ""Silcon Forest"" or a ""Silicon FooBarBaz"" in their neck of the woods because successful tech businesses produce a lot of good jobs and tax revenues.  So, the city starts an incubator, promote their new downtown as a tech hub, and hope for technology companies to spring up and boost the local economy.<p>I believe that one of the reasons that Y Combinator succeeded was because it wasn't about boosting tech companies in regions, it was about funding startups.  PG and Co. set out to hack the economy by seed funding crap loads of startups.  So, to that end, they started funding startups in the locations that were best suited to that:  Boston and SV.  They then went on to localize primarily in Silicon Valley because they thought it was the best move for their startups.  ( and they were sick of being bi-coastal )<p>The difference in those two motivations, is I believe a watershed between the wins and the fails.  YC has done what's best for their startups because that's their primary goal.  The vibe I get is that a lot of other incubators try to do what's best for their region and are therefore conflicted.",1247828628

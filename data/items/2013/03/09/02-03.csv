Your reply suggests that it's not the implementation specifics that you're after, but that was the understanding I got out of the original article.<p>> I just want them to recognize that when they compare using a hash table to other alternatives, that looking up items in a hash table has a performance cost.<p>As you obviously know, looking up items in a hash table has exactly a constant performance cost (amortizing the cost of a resize, and accounting for load factor, etc.), making it an attractive solution in cases where you need a lookup. I'm curious if your point is that the interviewee is missing that nasty c constant in front of the big o, (e.g. computing a hash for an item or the cost of a resize is impractical, say) or if the issue is that they are just missing something big picture and fundamental given the problem statement.<p>The former really speaks of ""losing the tree for the forest"", as in the person black-boxed something they needed to open up, whereas the latter strikes me as more of a lack of conceptual reasoning.<p>Thanks for your time!

I spent a lot of time studying, mostly at Oxford and USC ie smart places, and my impression is that hardly any of my colleagues were a patch in overall brightness on many of those whom I have met in the past few years in the Bay Area. However, criteria for smarts are also exceedingly heterogeneous, and you need to have breadth, experience and wisdom to see those smarts. And acknowledge your own weaknesses that you can work on them to be a more sophistimacated [sic] human. I now know so many more smart people than I did, but it may be that I've a. trained myself in humility and b. actually found smart people so I can learn from them, and thus provide more value myself from my strengths. This then underlines my argument as it means I probably did underestimate some of my Oxford compadres in my youth.<p>So, beware those claiming to be smart. Mostly, as most who've encountered Wolfram, Kurzweil and their ilk know, have a big chunk of smarts missing. empathetic and listening skills, huge in other kinds of pattern matching, which we haven't been able to code yet. I have a recent acquaintance who's like that too. Brilliant coder, engineer and hosts a History Channel TV show on inventions, but his ego is so set on his and his friends' brilliance that he misses the point.<p>Focusing on the processing and analytic skills is a blindness to the other equally important parts of a well-adapted and responsive psyche. That you have amazing memory, analytic and processing skills is truly wonderful, but A. it's not a moral plus, it's just a rare thing you have, like skills at piano or football, whcih can be trained, but mostly inherited too and B. if you rely on that alone you're neglecting a lot of other stuff.",1362797468

Yes, something that simple is something too hard for many computer science graduates who are seeking jobs after graduation.<p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you can't suppose that a computer science degree indicates ANYTHING about a job applicant's suitability to work for you. If you want to hire a programmer who will program well for you, test the job applicant's programming skill during the hiring process by having the applicant do a sample of the work you expect the programmer to do after the programmer is hired. In general, for hiring for any job, don't worry about degrees, but be sure to ask for a work-sample test.<p>References for why it's a good idea to hire on the basis of work-sample testing rather than on the basis of college degrees can be found in my extensive FAQ on the subject, written for Hacker News threads about hiring.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613543"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613543</a><p>LAST EDIT: As I expected, people still don't believe this story. I thought it was rather amazing when I heard it. But, with further thought, I've decided that this really is an empirical issue. It may be that some jobs have less drawing power, and attract mostly applicants who are trying to get a green card to stay in the United States. (That seems to be one thing going on in the applicant pool for the job that had the hiring process, with two computers sharing screen views over the Internet as the applicant worked on the problem, described here.) The way to find out what applicants to the job you offer can do is to put them to a work-sample test, realistic for the job you want done. I hear that FizzBuzz is still screening out a LOT of applicants for some jobs,<p><a href=""http://www.globalnerdy.com/2012/11/15/fizzbuzz-still-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalnerdy.com/2012/11/15/fizzbuzz-still-works/</a><p>but FizzBuzz isn't a lot harder than ""write a for loop,"" and certainly ought to be a job test that any CS graduate could pass.

5346975,comment,5345577,5345577,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"In application connection pools are a BadThing™.<p>Why is pooling connections in your application a bad thing you ask?<p>1. It keeps open N connections to the database for each one of your M server processes.  This is especially bad in Postgresql, as that means you have N * M idle processes on the database server.<p>2. It is very easy to improperly reset a database connection before giving it back out of the pool.  This leads to two problems.<p>problem 1: The first is that if code using a db connection has an error and doesn't issue a rollback, the connection will still be in a bad state when it is handed back out of the pool again.  On a webserver, this means that you will see strange exceptions where a query failed, and is very hard to debug, because the actual error was on the previous request to use that connection.<p>problem 2: It is inevitable that somewhere in your code you will not issue a rollback on a connection after starting a transaction.  In fact, if you are using Python the default dp-api behavior is to ""transactional mode"" where a BEGIN is sent immediately before any query on a new connection.  It will automatically start the transaction, but it will not COMMIT or ROLLBACK automatically.  The connection will be returned to the pool with a transaction started, and the transaction will be kept open, potentially for days or weeks.  This can cause an incredible number of headaches, performance problems, and cause your database's on disk size to grow much more quickly.<p>3. If you use a server like gunicorn, or a library like multiprocessing, open file handles (including sockets) are shared upon fork().  This means that if you aren't very careful to completely remove and recreate all the connections in your connection pool after a fork, you will have multiple processes sharing the same sockets.  The processes will then step all over each other and corrupt each others use of the database.<p>I have seen all of these problems multiple times in production code.<p>So, what should you do?<p>If you are using postgres, install PGBouncer on every server.  Configure your application to make a new connection to PGBouncer whenever it needs a new connection.  The overhead of this is tiny, since you connect to PGBouncer through a filesystem unix socket.  PGBouncer keeps open as many connections as it needs to the database server, maintains those connections, and puts them in a good state before giving them to you.  PGBouncer will also gradually reduce it's connections to the database server if they are idle and unused long enough.<p>I'm sure other databases have some similar database proxy.<p>Taking this advice will give you better performance, far fewer bugs, and hold many less connections to the database server.  Additionally, all your database uses can benefit from connection pooling in this way, even shell scripts which call psql.<p>In application pools of database connections is something that will bite you over and over, just say no.",1362795219

They have not engaged in any illegal practicesat least as far as anyone here knowsto secure this position, and the tablet market is in its infancy.</i><p>This is something that people continously get wrong.  What are perfectly legal practices for a non-monopoly may no longer be legal once you're a monopoly.<p>For example, if Apple had a monopoly on mobile phones it might be illegal for them to block ""replicated"" functionality in their app store.  Today its perfectly legal, but in a monopoly situation, its not.<p>For example, one of the things that MS was accused of was not allowing OEMs to put Netscape shortcuts on the desktop.  If Windows wasn't a monopoly that's a perfect fine requirement.  And as it stands today, Apple has strict requirements for what can get preinstalled on their phone/tablet by carriers -- virtually nothing.<p>Another thing MS was accused of by Netscape was withholding technical information.  Apple does this today.  In fact the Camera+ app, not only had to find technical information w/o docs, but once it did find the information, Apple removed their app from the app store.  Imagine if MS removed Netscape once Netscape found the info they were looking for.<p>MS was also accused of ""Giving Internet Explorer Away"".  All of these new features in iOS are basically free.  Again, giving away something at below ""cost"" is fine if you're not a monopoly, but <i>might</i> be illegal when you are one.<p>MS was also accused of making it difficult (financially or technically) to remove IE.  Again, you can't remove IE in WP7 or Safari in iPad, AFAIK.  Both perfectly legal.<p>Now I'm not saying MS was in the clear.  They were in fact a monopoly and did these things.  My point though is that Apple is treading this line with the iPad.  With the iPhone they're too small of a market.  But with the iPad being the dominant tablet (by a huge margin), they're behavior, which would be perfectly legal for the iPhone, is now questionable.",1307421763

Keystroke logging is the most obvious. In actual practice, there has not yet been a case of a password database being breached due to keystroke logging the master password (at least not among the market-leading password managers).<p>In actual practice, taking into account human factors, this system is more secure than that practiced by the vast majority of end users.

I mean, Firefox 4 on Windows is a pretty huge slice of the market.<p>How are other folks doing on this score? Have you actually tested your site widely? I've tried GoDaddy SSL and the results were even worse. I'm currently using a cert from NameCheap, but I'm considering shelling out the $400/year to get a Versign certificate just to make this headache go away.<p>I'm getting tired of trying certs and finding out they suck. I've heard GeoTrust is as good as Verisign (at $150/year) but I've heard people say that about GoDaddy too. It's hard to know who to trust. Pun intended.<p>In addition, I have no fricking clue how to debug what's <i>actually</i> causing these warnings, because a) I don't actually have access to test machines to see what's going on. And b) I don't know the first thing about how SSL chaining actually works. I could spend a week learning about SSL and HTTP requests, debugging and checking various browsers, but if I'm going to spend that time I might as well just buy a fricking VeriSign cert and spend that time coding.<p>There have been previous threads about this, but it seems like a lot of people's testing only went as far as ""works for me!"" I'd welcome experience from people who have actually dug deep into the situation with root certificates in various browsers.<p>And I haven't even started looking at mobile browsers yet.....",1307419763

Note that the example routes also avoid new/edit routes since this app actually generates those views on the client side.<p>Beyond that, plural or not, that's pretty much going to add zero value. Some people claim that the URL is an interface. While it might be, that's usually the lack of a better UI and a poor excuse to call something usable. I'll happily hide my URL bar when I can and rarely care to even write a proper URL by hand. Not because I can't but because I'm not a machine.<p>Now I do care about nice URI design but that's for me to care about, not the user. More and more I see people linking to things through shortening services anyway... so when do you really read a URL before following it? Probably never. Things like this are just for developer sanity.<p>So if you're going to bother writing a library, make it easier to express URIs that won't need to change and are explicitly designed, rather than worry over developer vanity and hiding details behind poorly thought out CRUD that people like to pretend is REST.",1307419640

If your seed wasn't stored then you have nothing to worry about, and I can only assume if you were contacted by someone from RSA(personally) than you should probably assume your seed was stored.<p>One would hope that a business like Lockheed Martin then setup a honey pot to try and gather information on the attackers logging in with these compromised SecureIDs.",1307419542

That money, as you say, represents an actual value that did not actually vanish. It's rather hard to say where it went, but it's unclear that there's a net drop in value for humanity.<p>This could in a certain sense be a case where the broken window fallacy actually holds up to scrutiny. Since the money is merely symbolic, no value is actually lost, merely shifted. People are adversely affected, but if they are spurred to create more value, it's plausible that the net benefit is positive to society.",1276750737

I wouldn't do it to save the lives of the same number of other people. I probably wouldn't even do it to save twice as many other people. At ten times as many I'd waver. If you want me to kill everyone I know and then myself in order to save the lives of a hundred times as many, I'd probably do it. Maybe.<p>They'd have to be some pretty damn awesome people I'm saving, and there'd have to be no other way. I wouldn't do it for poor starving people in Africa, that's for sure (You could probably save the lives of a million Africans for a lot less than you'd think . . . I wouldn't murder everyone I knew for a billion dollars and that would probably be enough to save a million African lives. Yeah, I'm a little selfish.). But you're right, there is a price. I'd certainly do it to save the entirety of the remainder of humanity. But even then you'd have to convince me that you could deliver on a promise like that, and I'm a tough sell.",1276750633

1437973,comment,1437378,1437378,0,0,rjett,,,"Here's my quick review of the whiteyboard:<p>After seeing the techcrunch review climb the HN front page a couple months back, I convinced my office to buy two of the 4' x 6' Berthas. I left the actual ordering up to my office manager. Five days after ordering, we still hadn't received our order so we called the folks at whiteyboard who told us that they must have lost our order. So we ordered again, they apologized for the inconvenience, and we were told it would be there within the week. A week passed and still no whiteyboard. We called the whiteyboard guys and they told us, sorry, but your order is stuck in customs. We apologize for the wait, but we'll get your order to you as soon as possible. So about 3 weeks later, our whiteyboards arrived. Drumroll please....<p>We put up the whiteyboard last week. There's a reason they don't show the Bertha in their demo video. It took 3 of us to put that monster up. After we got all the bubbles out, I wrote on it with the dry erase and tested her out. Writing on a whiteyboard is, as you would expect, exactly the same as writing on a white board. Next, I took the dry erase eraser to erase what I had just written. This works ok, but not as well as a regular white board. The dry erase smudges a lot more on the whiteyboard and you're left with a tint of whatever color you had just written in. A slightly dampened paper towel takes care of this though.<p>Each day I come in the office, the edges of the whiteyboard are slightly peeled away and there are a few bubbles in the middle of it to iron out so this can get a bit annoying, especially if there is stuff written on it that you don't want to erase.<p>Aside from the ordering snafu, I would say that the folks at the office seem to think the product is ok. Since I'm the youngest in the office, I have jokingly been dubbed the ""whiteyboard guy"" so I get a lot of shit for all its little quirks. My fallback retort is that we paid 10% of what a comparably sized white board costs and it still gets the job done. And even though it seems slightly ghetto at times, that's what matters, right?",1276749860

There is no driving on the left, no weaving, and there are no left turns with oncoming traffic.<p>Access onto the highway is a right turn for all directions. Access from the highway is light-controlled right or left turn. The highway has more capacity than the intersecting road, so while dumping traffic from the road onto the highway at a maximum rate using the easy right turns is fine, the light at the exit off the highway serves as rate limiter if necessary so that the road is not overwhelmed with traffic.",1276749551

One economic study found that in order to protect roughly five thousand owls, the opportunity costs -- that is, the income surrendered by the logging company and others -- would be $46 billion, or just over $9 million an owl.""<p>This is followed by a list used by the state of Connecticut in determining the amount of compensation allocated to work-related incidents - a specific value for the dismemberment of each body part.<p>The OP's point wasn't that this habit of affixing values is ethical, or even wanted, but that it is possible. You are arguing that 1) this is ridiculous and 2) it is not wanted.<p>The first is not true because thought experiments usually <i>are</i> ridiculous (hence the qualifier 'if') and even if this were not so, as the Freakonomics example shows, there are certain instances in real life where you would have to put a dollar value on a 'priceless' transaction in order for things to work.<p>And the second is also mistaken because, while something may not be nice to think about, that fact doesn't detract from the fact that it can be done, and is done, sometimes for good reason.",1276749478

You can, for example, annotate parameters to a function with type information to use primitives, java arrays, and remove the need for reflection.<p>Additionally, JRuby has had a JIT that attempts to do smart things to avoid unnecessary boxing and reflection. They've been rather impeded by the JVM on this front, but JVM 7 looks to open a lot of doors for the JRuby team to remove a lot of unnecessary dynamic dispatch in the execution of Ruby code.<p>The problem I see with Scala is it reeks of Perl 6's ""everything and the kitchen sink"" language feature-a-thon. Having learned Clojure and started Scala recently I'm constantly asking myself why Scala code has so much incidental complexity compared to the equivalent Clojure code. Often, it is due to the type system or the excessive number of constructs and syntax available in the language.",1276749298

The last couple of test chambers sucked due to not separating complex puzzles from the timed ones.",1276747902

DI is essentially a runtime activity while traits are just a more granular way of assembling your objects together at compile time.  I just don't see the intersection between the two concepts.<p>I have the feeling that you might be confused about what DI is exactly, but I'll happily eat my words if you can point me to a description of what you did, some source code, a blog post or whatever.",1276747853

If you refuse to choose between the life of your $FAVORITE_PERSON and the destruction of the Sistene Chapel, then you have chosen whatever consequences arise when you refuse to choose.<p>The important thing is not the specifics at stake, which are quite silly here, but the fact that you <i>have</i> to choose. You can't not. You don't get to not choose because it's ""arrogant"" to choose. You don't get to not choose because ""it's hard"". You have to choose. Choosing to ""not choose"" is a choice and in whatever situation your are in constitutes some choice itself.<p>People in the real world have literally and truly faced the choice of which of their children they will save. They chose something. I imagine a non-trivial number of them were paralyzed by the logic you are applying and chose poorly as a result.<p>It may help if you realize that a dollar isn't just a dollar, and once you start talking about millions or billions of them the character of a dollar changes in ways that far too few people realize. A dollar is blood, sweat, tears, time spent working instead of with one's family, a finite and characterizable risk of death in the aggregate, indeed, lifeblood itself converted into currency. Taking a billion of them out of an economy is to doom people to fractionally shorter lives, for marginal people to be lost, and a lot of other very serious things much more important than whether Johnny gets to buy a videogame this week. The extinction of a species and ten billion dollars are far more comparable than you might care to admit, not because you overvalue the species, but because you undervalue the dollars. They're not just scores in a game. They're human life.<p>(In other news, I consider white collar crime grotesquely under punished. Bernie Madoff may not have killed a man, but the damage he did in the aggregate adds up to at least one murder, in my book. He did not steal <i>dollars</i>, he stole <i>life</i>.)",1276747524

Those results should provoke <i>gales of laughter</i> from anyone here who actually checks their stats.<p>While the type of person who shops for software offline might pay more for it relative to an early adopting twenty-something who would prefer to pirate it anyhow, they do not pay so much more that it covers the retail markup.<p>Plus, selling software offline robs you of all the numerous ways you can play the retail game yourself, such as offering discounts, seasonal promotions, upsells.

If you want to ship a product that can backup out-of-the-box, without any customer configuration, good luck doing that for free.  Save yourself the pain and use RestBackup.  My management API lets you create and manage thousands of access urls, with per-url limits.  A software vendor can use this API to generate an access url for each application license that they sell.  This way each customer's data is separate and secure and the vendor maintains control of the charges incurred by each customer.  Paid services like RestBackup can offer these kinds of management features while still remaining economical for commercial software vendors.<p>I'm not interested in competing with free services.  I want to build a product that folks will pay for.",1276747215

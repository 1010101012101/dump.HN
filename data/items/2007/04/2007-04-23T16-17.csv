If it doesn't burst then its just industry growth.<p>I think the lessons were learnt the first time around and because the stakes are now comparatively very low the chances we are now currently in a bubble seem remote.",1177347065

It's a pity he feels the need to be such an ass:<p>""The folks who work at a non-profit organization are very interested in drawing a salary higher than their skills and working hours would command at a for-profit enterprise subject to competition. They are not especially interested in efficiency or accomplishment. ""<p>I know several people who work at Cambridge nonprofits.  They all earn about 1/3 what they could at comparable for-profit jobs.  They do so out of a sense of passion for the mission of the nonprofit.  Their lives have more purpose than, say, tooling around in airplanes.

16017,comment,15988,15988,0,0,danteembermage,,,"It was actually very easy to justify the valuations of many (but not all) internet companies in the first ""bubble"" although not by naive net present value calculations. The key is to model scaling up as a call option on a future larger version of the firm; you only get the larger version if your company ends up valuable. With a standard checking account type model the only ways to increase value are to increase cash flows or decrease your discount rate, but with an option other avenues become available.<p>   For example, the lower the strike price of the option, the more valuable. So Webvan = enormous initial outlay = high strike price = bad, whereas two college kids in the Yscraper = low strike = good. Another way to increase the value of an option, and I think this is the critical one for the first boom, is to increase the uncertainty of the value of the underlying asset i.e. the hypothetical larger version of the company. In the boom, that uncertainty was huge, we will all be buying pet food online next year, will Google manage all commerce of any kind in five, etc.<p>   So, interestingly, the very fact the wisdom of the crowd had no clue what Web 1.0 business should be worth may have driven the high valuations in the first place.<p>   In the second boom it appears 1. Strikes are lower, 2. Uncertainty is lower = affect on valuations is ambiguous. That's basically the conclusion of article as well as I see it, just approached from a different viewpoint.",1177345500

16014,comment,15988,15988,0,0,mojuba,,,"This second bubble was made possible by better web programming tools and languages -- everyone becomes a PHP/MySQL programmer nowadays. These tools weren't that affordable in 1990's.<p>Technology made many things easier, like copying books and music, automating everyone's tasks, etc. But it also made programming itself a lot easier. Programming improves everyone's lives and it improves itself too. So bubbles are inevitable (as well as inevitable are some oscillations).",1177345193

However, i&#x27;d argue that images from the porch of your house can be very challenging - harsh illumination changes, pose, scale, facial deformations (emotion, make-up, etc), occlusions, and even weather (rain on the lense, fog, wind throwing your hair over your face, etc).  You can really get a full gambit of difficulties we try to emulate in datasets - however there is a distinct advantage - the lack of imposters.  You&#x27;re not going to get more than a few hundred people entering through your front door every year (including yourself). This is actually very interesting. You can design an algorithm that fails with large data and still be very successful.  I honestly cannot recall any papers that address this type of problem, particularly because every paper discusses the government and security uses.<p>A method that robustly meets the needs of the average household, but is not under the same pressure to scale....interesting.

7680110,comment,7675711,7676587,1,0,mikeash,,,"The question of what the trees were used for and how the statues were moved, while interesting in general, isn&#x27;t relevant here. When deciding whether Easter Island represents a collapse due to resource exhaustion, the relevant questions are whether the trees were cut down at all (seems to be no dispute there), whether this represents general ecological destruction (in dispute, it seems), whether the population declined precipitously (no dispute here either), and finally whether that decline was caused by the ecological destruction.<p>Researching the question a bit (and <i>not</i> using Diamond as a reference, at least not directly or intentionally) I can&#x27;t see any support for the idea that the island was doing fine until outsiders bought war, disease, and slavery. As far as I can see, the war, disease, and slavery period followed European contact, but the initial population decline from a peak of around 15,000 down to 2-3,000 happened before European contact.<p>In the absence of external pressures, that seems to leave only resource depletion as the possible cause.<p>Even if it was external, though, why is &quot;land which isn&#x27;t being overrun by invaders&quot; different from any other resource?<p>As for other examples, Cahokia and the Anasazi are two possible examples in North America. The Norse settlement in Greenland is a more likely but smaller example. The collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization is another possible example. Malden and Pitcairn are two more potential Pacific island examples, both supporting human settlement for centuries, but eventually containing no people by the time of European discovery. Finally, there&#x27;s good evidence for a sharp genetic bottleneck in the human population deep in pre-history, in which the world population was reduced to 10,000 or less. The cause isn&#x27;t too clear, but whether it was a volcano, gradual climate change, or something else, it seems that <i>some</i> sort of resource limitation has to be at work.<p>None of these are completely clear-cut, but we can&#x27;t really expect them to be. A collapsed civilization isn&#x27;t necessarily going to leave a lot of records. Even if some of these were due to something else, it doesn&#x27;t seem likely that they <i>all</i> were.",1398956027

Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don&#x27;t seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don&#x27;t know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who&#x27;re thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.\nMost of you reading this are familiar with Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>You&#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both &quot;celebrity&quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google&#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are also really awesome.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> and be sure to mention that you&#x27;re coming from HN.

When I had trouble pointing out the exact corner that I was robbed on, the detective point blank asked me if I had made up the story of being robbed, to cover up for a botched meeting with a prostitute (which I guess is common on the west side or something?), because he just couldn&#x27;t believe why I would walk such a convoluted route to get home.<p>Also...this is something I learned in high school after learning to drive...when I had to walk or be driven to places, I never paid much attention to what order the streets were in...and only after driving myself does their order become important in my mind. Also, the age of Google Maps makes remembering streets even more irrelevant...I think that was also a factor in the detective&#x27;s skepticism of me being slightly confused about location.

It was obvious to any non-naive observer at the time that the block buy was designed to lock in billions of dollars in government spending to the ULA before SpaceX would come along and smash the existing pricing structure, offering launches that ULA couldn&#x27;t hope to compete with.<p>Even if SpaceX&#x27;s prices go up with EELV launches, and even if they would never incorporate reusability into EELV launches, they would still be able to offer launches for every possible EELV payload at prices far below ULA&#x27;s. Anything ULA could launch on any of their vehicles SpaceX could launch on the Falcon Heavy, and many launches (like GPS birds) could happen on the even cheaper Falcon 9.<p>With reusability, which SpaceX seems to have a good handle on, those costs get slashed, especially the cost of the Falcon Heavy. Any EELV payload could be launched on a reusable Falcon Heavy, even if it meant forgoing crossfeed. Even if the first stages could only be reused twice (a paltry amount) that would lower the cost of a reusable Falcon Heavy to around the cost of a Falcon 9, around $50 million.<p>Keep in mind that every ULA launcher uses an RL-10 in the upper stage, and that&#x27;s a $40 million engine. Even at discounted prices simply having an engine that expensive (to say nothing of the <i>rest</i> of the vehicle) on every launch makes it impossible to offer launches as cheap as SpaceX could.",1398954909

The only difference between the search field on google.com and the URL field in chrome is whether it knows about my internet history, and maybe that&#x27;s just because I have web history turned off.  Sometimes I get the &quot;Google Search&quot; behavior and sometimes I get the &quot;I&#x27;m feeling lucky&quot; behavior.<p>In cases where the google search gives the wrong response, chrome gives the same wrong response, for example on intranet servers.<p>So, if it doesn&#x27;t display the URL, and it behaves exactly like the search field on google.com, and it doesn&#x27;t correctly navigate to some URLs entered into the field, I don&#x27;t think you can really consider it a URL field any more.<p>In other words, it will make the whole thing a search field, with some smart url-friendly behaviors, so that most of the time when you enter a url it will take you to that url.",1398953037

I only have the vaguest idea how it works, and am perfectly happy to outsource its maintenance to professional mechanics, because all I care about is that it works.<p>This makes the same false assumption about the world when applied to computers: The world does not exist of a binary-human type: people who are experts and people who are not.<p>I own a 28-year old Volkswagen van. It is completely hackable: the only electronics are three relais. But I don&#x27;t hack it all by myself. I still, gladly drop it at the local garage to get something fixed. I can stop in nearly any town at the local garage and get stuff replaced, fixed or solved. I&#x27;ve had a waterpump fixed in Germany, my brakes replaced in Sweden, the battery replaced in France and so on.<p>And that is where the importance of hackability comes into play. Not the fact that /I/, myself can open up a browser or tweak it, but the fact that someone in my proximity can. Instead of having to ship my Macbook-pro to the US to get a fan replaced, my local fixit-guy can open my Thinkpad and replace the fan. Instead of having your computerized and closed-down car towed to the nearest official BMW-garage, I can drop my car at any place where they have a set of screwdrivers and some nuts and bolts and have it fixed.",1398953020

Snapchat is fun because as other users mentioned, I get to send bullshit one-off joke snaps to my friends. I don&#x27;t want to maintain a conversation of any sort through another app. However, knowing the conversation is immediately cleared further dissuades me. The point of this feature is that it&#x27;s good for non-committal &quot;conversations&quot; and very easy to engage/disengage.

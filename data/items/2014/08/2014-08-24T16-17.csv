I would say &quot;too experienced&quot; is a legitimate reason to reject someone from a role for this reason.</i><p>I&#x27;m pretty sure this kind of thinking is exactly the problem and accurately describes ageism. You&#x27;ve made assumptions about someone based on their age and don&#x27;t even want to bother interviewing them based on stereotypes that you think are true about older people. Of course, there are extremes to the &quot;too experienced&quot; situation. If a person with a Ph.D in Biology and Astrophysics applies to a job at McDonald&#x27;s, then perhaps something is off. But you should still talk to the person and find out what&#x27;s going on; not just assume.",1408899575

When &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot; comprises everything from people with 2-5 years of experience to people with 15-20, it indicates something is fundamentally wrong with the way companies view the work they need done.<p>The fact is you&#x27;re basically right: most companies don&#x27;t want experienced people who will do a very good job and expect appropriate compensation for that work. They want people who can do the job just good enough to pass off products that are marginally adequate enough to bring in a target margin. If said people are also more inclined to be easily &quot;persuadable&quot; or awed/intimidated into putting more effort in for less compensation, even better. Such a condition naturally leads to the implicit age discrimination we see in our industry.<p>Also, if companies were more open about the salary and compensation packages they will offer with a position, it might more effectively deter the unwanted &quot;seniors&quot; from even expressing interest.",1408898903

They start small, with a value they&#x27;re willing to lose. Say $20.

Thus extreme inequality corresponds to extreme imbalances in power, undermining our democratic institutions.<p>On the first point, &quot;you could approximately double the incomes of those living on less than $1.25 a day worldwide by transferring to them one-third of the consumption growth enjoyed by the world’s richest 1 percent since 1990. Think of it as bringing the consumption levels of the global 1 percent back to where they were around 2003 or 2004, in return for wiping out global absolute poverty. Is that such an unreasonable tradeoff?&quot; - <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-09/how-to-end-global-income-inequality#p1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-09/how-to-end-g...</a><p>And while a lot of Chinese have moved from poverty to wage slavery, the economic narrative isn&#x27;t really that rosy there either: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-30/chinas-income-inequality-gap-widens-beyond-u-dot-s-dot-levels"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-30/chinas-incom...</a><p>You claimed the fact that people had been lifted out of poverty since the 1970s was a sign that the economy was doing well. Why then is a 45 % tax such a problem, assuming the people paying it don&#x27;t end up below the poverty level? Considering what governments provide in terms of infrastructure, safety, education, social security, and health care, is that so much to ask for? It seems only fair to pay back to society for the opportunities provided for us. Also from a utilitarian stand-point societies with less inequality have less crime and improved well-being (assuming the GDP per capita is not too low of course). Tax is a necessary part of a well functioning society, not a bogeyman. We should just make taxation more fair by not making the middle class pay a disproportionate share - the wealthy often pay a significantly lower tax percentage on their earnings due to income being taxed higher than capital gains.<p>High tax rates do not prevent economic growth, in fact the opposite seems to be the case: &quot;During the 1950s and early 1960s, the top bracket income tax rate was over 90%--and the economy, middle-class, and stock market boomed.&quot; - <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-tax-rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-tax-rates</a><p>Tax rates are at an all-time low, inequality levels are soaring, and economic growth is poor. The gains from the high levels of productivity growth we&#x27;ve seen since the 1970s have been accumulating among a small elite. Doesn&#x27;t seem very ideal to me.",1408898462

Apple is certainly no more open than Adobe.<p>The Full Web - whatever. Don't support it in the browser, don't support browser plugins, fine. Safari on iPhone still crashes all the time.<p>Reliability, security, performance - these are all things that apply to native apps built for the App Store, so why are apps built with Flash excluded in particular?<p>Battery life - more irrelevance. I'm pretty sure that there are games on the App Store right now that will suck away your battery's life faster than most cross-compiled Flash games. Game loops are intrinsically always busy - they don't necessarily have a natural idle point like GUI event loops do, especially if they are running at less than their desired framerate.<p>Touch - this is an application quality issue. I don't see any difficulty in simply not approving apps that have awkward non-touch interfaces.<p>The last reason, it being another layer, is the most insidious. UI difference, performance, etc. are all irrelevant - games have weird UIs, drain battery, and poor performance is a quality issue. The truth is Apple doesn't want to be disintermediated. Apple wants developers to be strictly dependent on its tools and APIs, and not use anything between the app and the platform. This is particularly offensive to me as a software developer, and it's far worse than anything Microsoft has ever tried to pull. It's the reason why 3.3.1 is phrased the way it is, and it has nothing to do with Flash and everything to do with locking developers in.<p>As I see it, Flash on the web is used for three things: (1) video, (2) casual games and (3) ill-advised corporate intro screens.<p>I'd love to see video not needing flash, but it isn't, yet. Having a sand-boxed third-party FLV player, so that it didn't need to infect the Safari process, would be nice to have. I don't really see that approving such a process would be necessarily harder than approving any other native application on the App Store.<p>I'd love for (3) to disappear. I can't bear those things.<p>And it would be great if HTML5 was universally usable and performant enough to work for (2), but it isn't, yet. I know of many casual Flash games, though, that would work really nicely as apps, and Apple is <i>hurting me personally</i> by increasing the barriers preventing those apps on the web from being available on my device.

You can pick a frame of reference, and it should probably be an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference, but it's just as valid as any other frame of reference. Inertial frames of references move with respect to each other at constant, less-than-C velocity.<p>Ok, so you picked a frame of reference, and in that frame of reference you have two objects A and B moving away from each other, each with a velocity of 0.5c, for a total relative velocity of c. What does this look like to either of the objects? Well, to answer that question, we have to jump into their frames of reference, which are moving at 0.5c with respect to ours.<p>In this new frame of reference, one of the objects A is stationary. Object C that was stationary in the previous frame of reference is now moving at 0.5c. And the other object B, that in the previous frame of reference was moving away at c? In this frame of reference, it is moving away at less than c. Why? A combination of time dilation and space compression, which you probably know happens in special relativity.<p>In the original frame of reference, object A was moving at 0.5c because it took 1 year to travel from one point to another than are half a light year apart. In the new frame of reference, the object A is standing still and the two points are moving, and they're more than half a light-year apart, and it takes less than 1 year for the new one to get here. Similarly, time & distance separation between points that the other object B is passing have altered in the new frame of reference. There's some math which isn't that complicated but is a bit onerous, but the punchline is that it appears to be traveling less than the speed of light in the new frame of reference.<p>Why does space and time contort like this? So that a light particle traveling will appear to be moving at the speed of light in any inertial reference frame, regardless of the relative velocities of those reference frames.",1272562527

More readily hardware accelerated, behaves as part of the core browser instead of a hijacking addon (e.g., Ctrl+T while focused on a Flash applet = no new tab), and <i>much</i> better battery life on mobiles.<p>- Crappy restaurant websites and other crimes against humanity: These should just die, and HTML5 will hopefully inspire better design ethic than this. I don't buy the argument that hovering is no longer common used as a critical navigation feature in Flash - I see it <i>everywhere</i>, especially for crappy restaurant websites. Flash is also impossible to crawl which reduces the usefulness of the web overall. Hell, you can't even LINK to content in a Flash site. IMHO the ""full Flash site"" (as opposed to Flash being a component of a page) needs to die a fiery, painful death.<p>- Games: The only place where Adobe has even a remotely legitimate claim that Flash is an empowering product rather than a crutch.<p>When I think of Flash these keywords come to mind: slow, buggy, crashy, badly designed, usability nightmare, gimmicky, unprofessional, and just plain <i>bad</i>.",1272562160

Basically I don't have the answer. All I can say is that when an anti-particle is created, that is IDENTICAL to - per our model - a particle travelling back in time and being destroyed at the production point. Now we know the model works extremely well. It describes the system to a very high degree of accuracy, and can be used to make predictions about how that system evolves. So - if the model is correct (let's assume it is), and anti-particle production -> moving forward in time == particle moving backwards -> destruction, which is it that we are observing?<p>Basically, I think most physicists would say these two scenarios are the same thing, just expressed (or observed) in two different ways.<p>Edit: actually this highlights an important distinction between the quantum and macro-worlds. Things can only happen in one direction in the macro-world thanks to entropy (everything -> disorder).

But they're not willing to <i>actually pay</i> those taxes, and so they just don't. Greece is a poor country full of rich people. In that sense the austerity measures will be easy to implement: corruption is everywhere. As is a strong sense of entitlement...

I don't want to make the choice between watching a video and then restricting my own usage just so my phone has enough juice to make a call. I'd rather watch videos <i>and</i> use my phone, and the more power efficient everything is, the more the user can do this.<p>To put it in perspective, if Apple's numbers are to be believed, running Flash alone <i>doubles</i> the power consumption of the device. That's insane.<p>> <i>""With that I answer: a:hover {}""</i><p>a:hover is no longer (it certainly used to be) a common tool used for site navigation. Which is to say, rollover dropdown menus are out like parachute pants - it's a non-issue on the web today. Just about every site works with ""clicks"", which is Apple's primary form of interaction with websites on touch devices.<p>The most compelling argument made though we've already been aware of for some time: cross-platform toolkits encourage lowest common denominator design. In Apple's world of pixel-perfect mockups and obsessive attention to detail this is abhorrent - and I'm inclined to agree. The iPhone's chief strength is its remarkably polished user interface - which for the most part remains true across its 3rd party app sphere, thanks in no small part to Apple's obsessive HID enforcement.<p>A Flash-compiled-to-iPhone app destroys this in the same way that a Linux Qt app hastily ported to Windows is the same.",1272560403

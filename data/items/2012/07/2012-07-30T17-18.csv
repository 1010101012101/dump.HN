A very small percentage of companies elicit huge interest (i.e., fast action, term sheet quickly, etc.)  A surprisingly small set of companies that meet with VCs elicit signals that are clear nos (e.g., not responding to emails and so on).  These are usually ones where the idea is so dumb or the pitch is so bad, the VC questions the entrepreneur's capabilities.  I'd say the vast majority of meetings turn into this netherland where the VC isn't sold on the idea but also isn't sold on NOT funding the idea.  S/he either doesn't know the space well enough, isn't sure his/her partners would agree, doesn't have enough clout in the firm yet (see previous point), doesn't know the entrepreneur well enough to feel conviction, etc.  So s/he doesn't say yes.  But s/he doesn't say no yet either because s/he wants the optionality in case  (a) another VC firm who is well respected or know the space decides to go after it (which creates the super-annoying lemming effect), (b) another partner and his/her firm gets ""conviction"" on the company independently, (c) s/he hears other good things about the entrepreneur, etc.  I think for most entrepreneurs, this is the most annoying category to be in.",1343670913

4313642,comment,4312535,4312535,1,0,adrianbravo,,,"> Our schools are not failing students because they are too hard.  They fail because few schools expect anything from their students and shy away from challenging their minds.<p>I think this is close to the mark, albeit vague. Challenging their minds in what way? Such a statement could be misinterpreted as, ""We need more rigorous test standards!"" or some other specific solution that does not necessarily meet the goal.<p>From personal experience, for classes other than upper-level math at my college, people would constantly ask questions like, ""Is this going to be on the test?""<p>And I was always annoyed by that. It seemed indicative of the meaninglessness of our education, and I can see why math classes are so difficult for people who learn this pattern rather than the subjects. I don't know how different it is at Ivy League or other schools perceived as high in quality, but when the majority of testing is multiple-choice, true-false, or fill-in-the-blank, it becomes easy to look at everything you learn as a task of rote memorization. It's like that saying: when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. The difference with math that makes it so ""hard"" is you often can't rely on rote memorization. You have to actually learn the material (or understand algorithms and memorize steps to finding solutions with different initial conditions). People get discouraged (probably early on) by the fact that the skills they use for academic success elsewhere do not always work with math, and I think they associate those negative emotions with ""math is hard.""<p>I don't know the solution, but I think people need to at least realize that rote memorization is not indicative of learning. It's an uncomfortable realization because so many of our metrics for academic success rely on the assumption that memorization equals learning or understanding.<p>Of course, that's unlikely. The status quo is always easier. Why do we expect so little from adults?",1343670689

There's no point in making reference to ""hereafter devised"" media if they medium is assume to be fixed at the time of license.<p>Further, ""[the] rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats"" which clearly gives you the right to change mediums as long as we do not violate the clause on adaptations.<p>The adaptation clause, of course, it up for some interpretation.

If it was not, it would have probably been a huge blunder to call this the ""No Derivatives"" license. The standard test here seems to be whether the transformation had any significant creative input, and since you conversion was almost purely mechanical, I would argue that it was not significant enough to be considered a derivative.<p>One thing you did forget to do was to include the CC license itself.<p>Disclaimer: IANAL (or Copyright Scholar).

Compared to an RDBMS, GAE's datastore is a <i>much</i> more natural fit for Java object graphs because it supports hierarchical data and is naturally polymorphic.  Hibernate makes crazy contortions to match up the models and this complexity bleeds through to the API.  There is definitely a learning curve if you have a background in RDBMS development, but you can say the same about MongoDB or Riak or any other NoSQL store.  Nevertheless, the benefits of an autoscaling, distributed, replicated, zero-administration datastore are compelling.<p>#2a If you really really want MySQL, GAE now offers it (Cloud SQL).<p>#3 is a bit ambiguous - yes, there are limitations, as there are in any hosted environment.  There's a 60s deadline on startup requests, but it's not usually hard to keep even Spring apps under this limit.  The missing Java classes are things like Swing - you won't miss them.  Yes, things like the Servlet spec are a little old, but the servlet api hasn't changed in any material way in the last decade.<p>It's not perfect, but App Engine is still an awesome platform for startups.

It's tiny.<p>One problem with this 7"" form factor is that the portrait orientation isn't wide enough to display most regular web pages without having to zoom in and scroll around;  it's just like browsing on your smartphone.   I'm also struggling to find any software that wouldn't look and work in exactly the same way on a regular sized smartphone.

The browser is particularly poor, which surprised me.  It's difficult if not impossible to reliably tap on small links.  There's no visual indication of what you've tapped, or the indication is delayed, or that indication is completely hidden under your finger.  Often you will tap on a link and a magnifier winder will pop up instead; I still haven't figured out how to trigger that.  Taps may not register at all, and there's virtually no visual indication that the browser has begun loading a new page.  It makes the browser seem fussy and unreliable, and consequently is not a joy to use.  As a result, if I need to look something up then I'll grab my iPhone before I grab the Nexus.  The browser is also missing some important iframe performance and usability improvements that appeared in iOS 5.<p>It's hard to argue with the price, but if you already own an Android phone then I'm not sure why you'd buy this device.

That is because the PI's PSU was chosen with a power budget of 700mA in mind of which 200mA were assigned to the two USB ports, so the raspberry PI's (poly)fuses were designed only for <100mA devices, and typical 140mA polyfuses will have as much as 0.6 volt across them when drawing currents near the 100mA limit. As a consequence the USB ports are only directly suitable for ""single current unit"" USB devices which according to USB specifications are designed to work with just 4.4 Volt.

There's the squared-edge design, the round-edge design, and the multicolor front design. There's also an octogon-edge design (for some reason), which is non-obvious and would be noticeable if copied. All the other differences are on the back (where every vendor is different anyway) or in button placement (where every vendor is different anyway).<p>Apple went through 45 revisions quite possibly because they had never designed a phone before. And when they did settle on a design, they picked round edges and a screen that takes up most of the front minus room for a button and a speaker. That's hardly the most original design they put into concept. It's no surprise Samsung can easily make a smartphone casing, they could just pull out the specs from their Palm OS 4 devices.<p>The question is, why didn't Apple make the iPhone look like the iPod Mini? That was a seriously cool and original case. Now Nokia is making the same design.",1343669247
4313485,comment,4312568,4313136,2,0,cpleppert,,,"The chrome(!) of the Chrome browser is one of the worst aspects. The buttons and tabs are way too small on the top. They are big enough to steal valuable screen space from the page itself but are simply too small to click reliably.<p>Miscellaneous issues that are shared with chrome on ios also abound. On page open, the focus doesn't manually switch to the address/search bar and requires a separate click. What a disaster. The last closed tabs are buried under the top sites that manage to be insanely hard to customize. The bookmarks cut off text and don't have any way to switch to a list view.The only redeeming feature is the ability to swipe across the screen to switch tabs.<p>On large pages the browser performs slowly and crawls along while Firefox beta scrolls admirably and doesn't deliver blank white spots. This way fine back in 2007 on the iphone but in 2012 it is a little ridiculous. Firefox Beta is pretty good although I would like a new tab button and some way to swipe across the screen to switch between tabs.<p>Flash also works fine and hq video isn't painless at all.",1343669241

4313415,comment,4312501,4312856,2,0,maebert,,,"Ex-Neuroscientist here. Your explanation is quite accurate, though I believe they use a more modern variant called Diffusion Tensor Imaging. The idea of MRI is that you put the brain into a huge magnetic field, switch the magnet of and count how long it takes for the nuclear spin to jump back to random states in different areas of the brain - this time is specific to each different atom and allows for an estimate of the concentration of different atoms (like water). In DTI, the hypothesis is that water molecules line up with the neurons axons (the long cables that connect neurons to distant other neurons). If change the direction of the magnetic field gradient a couple of times, you don't just get one value per voxel  (how much water is in there), but slightly different values for each direction. The highest value is _probably_ the direction of alignment of the majority of axons in that voxel.<p>The problem is not the tool, but the statistical analysis of the data, which depends on a lot of parameters, and the number of different gradient directions, which are usually orthogonal, hence favouring orthogonal neuronal connections and discounting those that are diagonal to the gradient directions. You have to correct for this in the analysis, but it's very hard to do, and mostly guesswork. Which coincides my personal evaluation of the entire study: guesswork.",1343668534

People with a broad background aren't just more inclined to problem-solve, they're better at it -- they come up with more innovative and subtle solutions, they're better able to manage their own time, etc.  Time and time again I see issues being kicked around until they land at someone with a ""well-rounded"" background, who actually is willing to examine and solve the problem rather than looking at it from a single perspective.<p>I don't doubt that one can arrive at this state of mind without attending college, or that some who attend college fail to get there.

It's one I explored in detail when I was evaluating an opportunity in the education space between September and January.  There are a variety of big problems in the education space, most of which centre around the problems of bureaucracy.  Here the fundamental issue is that it's extremely difficult for school boards that are offering the same salary scale to everyone regardless of skills/subjects (which is the norm in Canada and much of the U.S.) to get similar levels of teaching talent for subjects that are highly in demand.  This tends to lead to a notion of progress that involves reducing the math curriculum to the point where the ""math"" teachers you have can actually teach it well.  This is often spun as giving everyone more opportunity for success or presented as innovation to curriculum, and many buy into that spin.  The answer of teaching better is the best solution when it's actually possible, but the combination of convincing government to spend it, and convincing the unions to allow it to be spent well is nearly impossible.  The net result is something similar to the system we have.  Perhaps worst of all, entrepreneurs get scared away from the space because there isn't anything worse than dealing with enterprise style sales processes for sales numbers that simply are not.",1343667744

The real question is one of integrity. If a researcher has integrity then they will be objective. If they lack integrity then they may be more willing to twist their findings, even if they don't outright manipulate them. It does no good for a company to fund a researcher who is ultimately proved to have faked data.<p>One note on public funding, I believe that there is just as much if not more pressure to shape conclusions from public funding sources. After all these organizations are composed of people as well who are often pursuing an agenda of some sort whether its overt or not.

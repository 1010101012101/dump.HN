6828921,comment,6828378,6828724,22,0,alexgartrell,,,"> write a very simple UNIX-based operating system in C++ (does anyone else smell a contradiction?)<p>I&#x27;m going to use this as an opportunity to champion C++ for systems programming despite the fact that it wasn&#x27;t really your argument.  I feel obligated to do this because I agreed with you for a long time on this but have changed my mind over the past year or two.<p>The argument against C++ as a systems programming language has always been that it gives you too much freedom to hide complexity, but I&#x27;ve written systems code in both C and C++ professionally and it&#x27;s been my experience that the extra burden of having to write <i>every</i> <i>damn</i> <i>thing</i> over again in C (or use a relatively poorly tested container library, as compared to something like the STL) is not worth the &quot;obvious performance characteristics.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d further contend that in non-trivial software all perf characteristics are non-trivial, so even though a + b might be doing all kinds of crazy things in C++, you&#x27;re much more likely to run into problems invoking store_value() which might interact with a number of underlying libraries and system calls.  At the end of the day you&#x27;re hopelessly screwed without profiling and the utility perf works just as well on C++ programs as it does on C programs.<p>Finally, the majority of code in my experience is either slow path or at least not the bottleneck anyway.  You can almost always optimize a systems program by making smarter system calls (or hardware invocations), while optimizing CPU is rarely worth it.  Even if you&#x27;re CPU bound, it&#x27;s likely that it&#x27;s in doing something like SSL, wherein you&#x27;re almost definitely wrong to try to jump into a project like OpenSSL with micro-optimizations.  With that in mind, why not allow yourself to move faster by creating a std::vector?  When you use the proper conventions, it&#x27;s generally as fast anyway.<p>Just because people can (and have, a lot) misused C++ and created way too much complexity with it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not the preferred language in the hands of someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing.  (And yes, it&#x27;s much harder to learn how C++ works in a meaningful way to avoid these pitfalls, but if it&#x27;s your job, learn it anyway).",1385927569

6828914,comment,6828626,6828626,2,0,eshvk,,,"It depends on what your background is. And what the role looks for. There is a wide spectrum of programming vs statistics background that may be required for a job. Having said that, here is a list of basic stuff that may be useful to know.<p>1. Computer Science:<p>- Algorithms/D.S. Enough to be able to identify what sort of problems are C.S. problems or statistics problems.<p>- Systems. You may not have to build a system but it is useful to know how the real world systems are built, what sort of constraints come into play, what trade-offs are there. Especially, if you will be working with large scale datasets. You don&#x27;t want to be remembered as the dude who did a select * order by rand limit 10 on an HBase table.<p>- Programming Language: Learn one programming language well. Depending on your job, you may need to learn more than one. Python is a nice starting language. One useful trick to learning more languages is to learn one language really well and see how stuff you can do changes in the other language. Also, side note: don&#x27;t get into one true language debates. They are useless. Every language has its pros and cons.<p>2. Stats/Math/ML:<p>This is tough to kind of characterize. Because the field is so diverse.<p>- Probability: Get some basic probability under your belt. Getting the intuition right is more useful than learning a lot of stuff. You can pick up more complicated stuff (Stochastic processes, Stochastic Calculus stuff) as and when you progress further anyway.<p>- Statistics: At the very least, figure out hypothesis testing, biases, p-values, estimators and regression. The more statistics I learn the more I am of the opinion that the tools matter less as much as a critical understanding of where statistics should apply. What biases are there and how you can identify them.<p>- Linear Algebra: Again a very basic undergraduate linear algebra course (with vector spaces) should help you understand say Matrix completion stuff. Of the top of my head, I think grokking how vector spaces work, what independence means, how dimensionality reduction, kernels work is useful.<p>- Machine Learning: This is mostly a tie up of the kind of stuff you learn in the math courses. My basic 101 ML grad school covered the following: Unsupervised Learning (KMeans or some clustering algorithms), Supervised Learning (Discriminative, Generative approaches, bias - variance tradeoffs etc). I also learnt some silly bullshit on Genetic algorithms.<p>So yeah, as long as you learn the basic fundamentals really well, you should be able to pick up stuff fairly easily.<p>E.g. Recommendation systems, I never learnt most of this in school as part of a specific course. However, once you know what goes on in Matrix decomposition and know what regression is, you can understand the why of why people do what they do when they solve these problems.",1385927529

I think that Stefan Molyneux (or however you spell it) is right on when he says that bitcoin is &quot;a revolutionary protocol for information synchronization.&quot;  However, it is by no means unique, and as we&#x27;ve seen, anyone can start their own bitcoin-type cryptocurrency.  Apparently, the Canadian government is working on their own, and I don&#x27;t think it will be long before other central banks begin to follow suit by adapting the bitcoin protocol for their own purposes and presumably solving some of its myriad problems in the process.  And of course, when given the choice between a new-and-improved cryptocurrency that&#x27;s guaranteed by a central bank and the old one that&#x27;s guaranteed by nothing, Joe Blow is going to pick the former. Bitcoin is an amazing idea and I do believe that the idea behind it it will revolutionize transactions, but it won&#x27;t be alone for long, and once the improved versions begin showing up, those who&#x27;ve held on to bitcoin because it&#x27;s an amazing idea (it is) without realizing that bitcoin itself has only a very thin economic moat are probably going to have a bad day.<p>I&#x27;ve been trading and investing stocks for about 7 years now, and I think I&#x27;ve learned a thing or two in that time, but one of the most important things I&#x27;ve learned is that if holding onto something is making me uncomfortable, it&#x27;s time to sell.  Holding my bitcoin was making me uncomfortable as of a couple of days ago, so I sold.  On the other hand, I&#x27;ve also learned that if everyone is expecting something to do one thing, it usually does the opposite, and it seems that pretty much everyone agrees that bitcoin is in a bubble.  If it does crash, I&#x27;ll get back in, but if it doesn&#x27;t, I won&#x27;t regret selling.  I&#x27;ve been on the emotional rollercoaster of watching relatively large sums of money invested in a volatile asset fluctuate wildly, and I&#x27;d rather not go through that again.

I&#x27;m a regular IT guy, unless I create a hot startup I will always be a guy whose influence can only be measured by statisticians.<p>With that out of the way. I don&#x27;t want to live in a country or principally trade in a currency that can react as bitcoin. I don&#x27;t have a lot of cash sitting in my bank account, instead I have a small amount of debt (only Banker salary allow you to buy a flat cash in London) so I fail to see any situation where a 10,000 % deflation rate can affect me positively. (Similarly 10,000% inflation - actually 0% inflation is the stuff I can deal and be happy with)<p>So I don&#x27;t mind a uncontrollable currency as I don&#x27;t mind the wind being uncontrollable. I mind hurricane and if I cannot afford to deal with it, I simply prefer to live in an area without hurricane or as a last resort, government provided countermeasures. So in my situation, one I share with the majority of the first world, I prefer a currency controlled by FED-like central banks, than a currency without control that can increase my debt by 2 order of magnitude and at the same time likely put me out of work.

The folks in charge tend to subscribe to Keynesian economic theory.<p>The tl;dr on &quot;inflation is good&quot; is that it benefits people borrowing money. If your wages keep pace with inflation, then things like your car loan and mortgage ultimately cost less, leaving you with more inflation-adjusted money to lubricate the economy with. Inflation stalling (or even receding into deflation) means that it&#x27;s much more expensive in terms of wage-hours to pay back an existing debt, which discourages people from taking on new debt. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/business/economy/in-fed-and-out-many-now-think-inflation-helps.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/business/economy/in-fed-an...</a> is a decent article on the concept.<p>A deflationary currency, by contrast, will heavily discourage borrowing. This analogy is a little stilted by the BTC<->USD conversion, but if I agree to loan you 10 BTC to be paid back over 5 years so you can buy a $10,000 car, and over the term of the car loan, let&#x27;s say that the value of BTC is going to increase from $1000 to $4000 (that is, the amount of value traded in BTC is increasing faster than the amount of BTC in the market), then you&#x27;d be a fool to take my loan, since you would effectively end up paying me $40,000 worth of BTC for a $10,000 car. This would discourage you from taking my loan and buying the car, just because of the behavior of the currency.<p>(That said currently, since lenders get a chunk taken out of their loan by inflation, they make it up in the interest rate. In a consistently deflationary market, it seems to my non-economist brain that the answer would be a smaller - potentially even negative - interest rate, which would be pegged at a point that the lender still makes money over the course of the loan without being overly discouraging to borrowers.)",1385927042

There was a singular focus throughout the day: get shit done.<p>That involved no computers, no phones, no digital distractions. Just blowing up stuff, building bridges, or moving boulders by hand.<p>Physically draining work that at the end you try to somehow find a can of un-skunked beer to cheer to.<p>I remember the culture was unkind to office work, they saw it as soft. That&#x27;s partly why they were out there in the first place, unfit for mainstream society, not wanting to be desk jockeys, just good ol&#x27; boys, the desperate, the unwanted, the jailed, standing around in uniforms doing things with their hands. I made sure I never told anyone I was any good with computers.<p>The type of problem solving we had to do on a day to day basis didn&#x27;t require too much thought, and if anything there were always policy or documentation to explain what to do and how to do it.<p>Long days, hard work, but I never had to use my brain. I quite enjoyed functioning as a tiny cog in a big machine despite the risks.<p>Transitioning home, I found work at a premier tech company, one where they make phones, tablets, and computers. The work was different. I stared at screens all day. Inside a cubicle with fuzzy walls, where often times the only communication I have were email chains.<p>Operating a computer, functioning as a tiny switch in a big board required the a more precious asset: my brain. I was thinking all the time, trying to recall, connect, and communicate. And doing the same thing all day is... boring.<p>I went home every night drained. Physically, mentally, and emotionally. The days weren&#x27;t as long, the environment wasn&#x27;t bad, the risk were low but the work is hard. I hated it.<p>Nowadays I code. I romanticize my job by equating it to writing love poems to an inanimate object. Sometimes I get affection, often times I get rejection. It&#x27;s an ongoing love-hate relationship. One that just takes and takes from my brain while leaving me a soft, mushy lump on a nice Aeron chair yearning to be free.<p>Computers took a lot from me since I was 10. Two decades late I&#x27;ve only barely learned how to take a lot from computers.<p>Find your balance.",1385926848

The industry is ripe for innovation! We&#x27;re building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth for months now.\nI know &#x27;app for laundry&#x27; is a tech cliché right now, but we&#x27;re definitely encountering real demand. The problem is real, and we&#x27;re solving it.<p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading operations, and a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition. I&#x27;m Stanford CS/EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business. The tech stack is Heroku / Python / Django / Celery / Phonegap / JQuery / Backbone / Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a Web Developer or Front-end Developer to develop interfaces for our customers, tools for our personnel, and visualizations for our managements. Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for a Director of Marketing. Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and &#x27;growth hacking.&#x27; We&#x27;re building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business. Please see a job description at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1dLJigo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/1dLJigo</a> - The sky&#x27;s the limit!<p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes.

He could leverage his asset to borrow money from the incumbent banking system at super low rates as he uses his BTC stash as collateral.

Kings produced coins, gave them to soldiers, and mandated that the citizens accept the coins as payment for goods. This created a market, and solved the problem of how a kingdom could supply the needs of an army (weapons, clothes, and food).<p>He does thoroughly deconstruct the barter origin story, by showing that barter economies were actually driven by credit (and thus credit pre-dates money).<p>The story about religious ceremonies and temples is that in pre-market societies, there was a social currency (wampum, copper rings, special cloths, etc) used for ceremonial purposes. It was when market economies (and market currencies) became entangled with the social currencies that you see the development of slavery.",1385924588

They'd buy these in addition, and in much greater numbers.<p>Apple has 10% marketshare. If they put out smaller, lower cost system, it's unlikely that the losses from existing mac users switching to a lower cost system would outweight the gains of people who would buy a decent mac netbook over a crappy windows one.",1256169586

895911,comment,895535,895640,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>Presumably, he means that netbook sales would cannibalize high end laptop sales. But that's doubtful.</i><p>In order to compete with other netbooks, a hypothetical Apple netbook would necessarily be <i>the least expensive Mac</i>. This would definitely cannibalize their sale of better models to first-time customers, who currently constitute a significant portion of Apple's Mac sales (as much as 50% from their retail stores).<p>It comes down to a question which set of customers is going to be more profitable: customers looking for ""a cheap laptop"" or customers looking for ""an Apple computer"". All else being equal, I think it's obvious that the latter is more desirable. The mistake that many in the press have made is assuming that these customers are in short supply and that Apple will begin struggling to find them Real Soon Now, but this hasn't turned out to be the case. There may be more of the former kind, but would Apple <i>really</i> be able to capture two, three, four times as many of them as they are their current customers?",1256169286

I've been visiting your country for a few weeks now on holiday, and I've found both here and NZ to be places with wonderful people and scenery.<p>Having said that, both places seem to have a bit of the nanny-state complex. I can sympathize that it is frustrating -- but it's not all bad, by any means. We've had a wonderful time.<p>I'm not sure I would chose to live here, however. I've traveled and lived in a bunch of places in the states, and the attitude seems a bit different here. I remember being in NZ last week and seeing the front page of one of their papers -- ""New Zealand's Millionaires"". It was three or four poor blokes mug-shotted on the front page, just like they had been caught robbing a liquor store or something. The message was clear: rich people have somehow cheated their way to the top. These guys are not to be emulated (except maybe as hoodlums)<p>So that (and a few other things) makes me more of a visitor who would like to come back than somebody who would want to live here.

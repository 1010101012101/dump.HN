My strategy was to look for job postings with the word ""Analyst"" in the title, and focus on small companies. Those are the positions where you'll be working on solving innovative problems, at varying levels of definedness. Small companies, especially in niche markets, are more willing to hire people with a BS and good potential but not a lot of experience. Companies in a more niche or botique line of work, or a new emerging field, are also more willing to hiring people with more potential than experience (I got into web analytics myself, which hasn't been around very long).<p>If you're not sure about the opportunities you have, find a part-time position or a paid internship. It's less risk for you, and it's less risk for the company so it's easier to get the position. If it's something you like you can upgrade to full-time (as was my case), and if not, you can still gain skills and experience while shopping around.<p>In terms of lowering your expectations, you likely won't achieve the most prestigious position, but you can certainly find a position that's interesting and personally rewarding in an area that you want to be in.

Thanks for  taking the time to provide us with so many good points; it's hard to see many of the things you mention from a fresh perspective, as I have been staring at this project for a long while.<p>There is no option to hide your location, however it doesn't get more specific than the zip/city even if you used an actual home address to set the zip/city/etc.  However, I agree it should be hidden and consider it done.  Easy to add, I'll do so today.  I have talked to a few people about adding a 'fuzz' factor to routes, so that the start/end doesn't touch your house.  I am not sure how I want to implement this yet, so it hasn't been done.  but, it is being thought about!<p>Soon we will have photo geotagging on routes.  Should be an easy enough task, it's just been on the todo while we make what we have more solid.  I like the Flickr integration and will investigate it.<p>I will clarify the email address hiding stuff, thanks for pointing out the confusion.<p>I haven't investigated how to assign timezone based on zip/city, but I would be surprised if Google doesn't provide that with geolocation information.<p>Thanks for reminding me about the weight problem.  I will flag it as needing change, so your base weight is on your profile and gear weight on the bike.  Additionally, I know people that want to track individual weight per ride, so I'll have to probably default to a riders last ride weight, profile weight or inputted weight when they log an activity.<p>Route planning currently does allow markers, they are called 'course points' (according to garmin), but that name is not too friendly.  I'll massage that, but, you can currently add markers around the route it's just a kludgy UI.  I am reworking that really soon, after I finish my week long list of bug fixes/improvements.<p>We have been working on multiple route display/comparison, including segment matching (same leg of even different trips), but it's very rough and not forward to the public.  It will be cleaned up, released and expanded soon.<p>I agree the embed is ugly, it's just been so easy to forget it exists!  It's on the list, highlighted, including adding more options for the person doing the embedding.<p>The product will always be free, but to a limited ability.  I agree however, we have not expressed that very well.  I'll sit down with Zack and Cam and come up with some explicit language that will help people with this.<p>We plan on adding events, most likely as a premium feature.  I would love to have cyclists register and appear on the list of an event, with some way of showing it in their profile.  We have been talking about this for a while, but haven't nailed anything down.  It needs to (and will) be done before spring, when the riding season starts really taking off.<p>Thanks again for sharing our site around and generating the exposure.  Traffic is already way up from both this post and your forum, so it is MUCH appreciated.  I'll jump on that forum as well and get involved with the discussion.   Additionally, I'll bug you later today when I have implemented some of your suggestions.",1262626154

It's not clear how much you've done already, but what you don't know you can teach yourself.  First, start some programming projects on your own or contribute to existing free software projects.  That'll force you to learn most of the practical skills you need.  If you want jobs where you get to work on interesting problems, you should start learning computer science theory too.  With your background you should find it fairly easy to pick up much of an undergraduate CS education from a few good books.  (In your position I'd start with SICP, which is available online with video lectures by the authors at MIT OpenCourseWare.)<p>Even before that, you can apply for entry-level software development jobs.  Companies that hire new graduates don't really expect them to have useful real-world experience.  (It's a big plus if they do, but it's not necessary.)  If you can learn basic data structures and algorithms, for example, you might well qualify as a college hire at a big shop like Google/Amazon/Yahoo/Microsoft that has the resources to hire a lot of junior programmers and train them on the job.  And use your friends, professors, and alumni network to find companies that could use a good undergrad math student - these are rarer but they do exist.  <i>[Update: mga mentioned the financial sector, which is a great idea too.  I was a joint math/CS major, and some of my math friends went straight from college to companies like Fair Isaac (FICO).]</i><p>You <i>will</i> need more experience before you can explore certain opportunities - an undergrad math degree doesn't open many doors by itself - but you should try to get that experience working in development, not in IT.

I was one of the first to pounce on it with my other post in this thread, which I have since editted to show you the respect you deserve even though I still fundamentally disagree with your premise.<p>A few additional thoughts:<p>No one is ""just a geek"".  We are all very complex beings with lots of other ways to describe us.  Following a list of ""rules for geeks"" drops us to an unnecessary lowest common denominator.<p>Sometimes, the only difference between ""surviving this social function"" and ""learning something in the next hour that may change my life"" is mindset.  A postive mindset is often best achieved by ignoring many of your rules.<p>Nothing is mandatory.  No one really has to do anything they don't want or go anywhere they don't want (with a few obvious exceptions).  It's a stupid waste of everyone's time to go somewhere you don't want and then, to make matters worse, not be yourself.<p>No one should mask themselves or adopt alternate personas.  You only get one life so that's the one you should live.<p>I suppose one of the reasons I feel as strongly as I do is because I was once an isolated geek who adhered to many of your rules.  Once I stopped doing that and just allowed myself to be myself, social situations didn't seem that much different from engineering problems and now I'm equally comfortable with either.

However, they are selling the entire value to the consumer.<p>So if (and it's a big 'if') the unused minutes are unclaimed property, then gov't escheatment isn't a tax, it's reclaiming lost property on behalf of the consumer.  The consumer paid for the <i>entire</i> value of the card, not the value of the card minus a bonus for the issuing company.<p>Anything left over on a card should be treated as pure bonus to the companies, not a standard revenue source that needs to be recouped.  If they do raise rates to recoup lost revenues, then it is the companies performing a cash-grab, not the gov't.  This is why companies like gift cards and pre-paid minutes cards... they've been able to extract out the unused value from the cards for years, and it's all ""extra"" money that they didn't have to earn.",1262624454

#3 - The people worth being social with are those who are themselves (to the extent anyone is fully themselves), so if you merely play a character it will not help you form any interesting relationships (which is why we socialize, right?).
Indeed, the ""you"" part must be served at the correct dosage, but don't just act like whatever others expect you to.<p>#4 - Indeed, before you say anything make sure you listen a lot, rather keep your mouth shut and get a view of what people are talking about and their stances. But, when you finally say something, make sure its never superficial but relevant and stuff that intrigue the others. Asking deep questions regarding something is the best way of showing an interest. If its too boring a conversation, listen for a while and move on - not your crowd.<p>#6 - Agreed, don't be too pedantic, but if that's your flaw no one will dislike you that much for it - and if they do, screw'em. I'm too pedantic, and some people hate it so i try to tone it down, but I believe in being yourself so it sometimes comes out either way.<p>#9 - Someone will ask of your job, and when you answer ""IT"" they will 90% of the time ask you to explain further, unless they already view you as completely uninteresting, at which point nothing matters really. I have tried to explain to some extent what i do as a programmer more than a 100 times, and especially to women with no technical understanding there's just no working analogy and after 15 minutes of back and forth we tend to settle at ""computers and stuff"" and I can use that settlement as a humorous thing - in other words, something positive. If you are remembered as the person that simply couldn't explain what the heck he's doing then that beats not being remembered, 10 out of 10 times. Just go for it.
People tend to like passionate people, show your passion but restrict yourself from the geeky way of presenting it. And take equal passion in understanding what they tell you, if someone talks about the fashion business you probably wouldn't understand a thing would you? ;)
Make a joke on your own behalf out of these things.<p>In general these tips sounded like a guide to lowering your social self esteem and how to not meet and get to know people. If that's your thing - stay home in the first place.<p>Rather talk to people, take interesting, share of yourself, don't hog a discussion though and let everyone have their talking turn. Be a good listener first and then talk, no one likes braggers indeed.
Learn to take an interesting in dead boring things that others find interesting, you might even be surprised just to watch how passionate someone will be over something so amazingly stupid. Remember to keep eye contact with people your talking to (not constantly though, most will be intimidated). Probably the best tip for looking interested is focusing on their nose, people cant tell the difference between that and true eye contact most of the time. (It will be easier for you, after all, these are things you have issues with probably).<p>I'm not saying I'm some expert, but I'm an overly social geek who loves people and knows a lot of them, and all of them know I'm a geek and i clearly say that I am as well. I've never gotten any disrespect for being a geek, although once in a while it will make women lose their interest as soon as they hear it - though not most of the time.",1262624415

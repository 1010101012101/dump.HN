77660,comment,77470,77645,0,0,hello_moto,,,"What happened these days is that company like Google and Microsoft higher smart and experienced students.<p>If you have 3.2 GPA and have experience with open source, you're qualified to be interviewed. <p>If you have 4.0 GPA, you're also qualified.<p>If you have 4.0 GPA and have experience (internship), you'll get an offer :).<p>It's both. Everybody wants the best talent available. For students coming out the school, GPA is what differentiate them the most because companies do not expect them to have tons of experience. They're hiring talent. <p>I don't know why we need this huge cultural shift and stuff like that because clearly our current systems are working fine. <p>There are outliers (people who have 4.0 GPA but sucks at coding), it's unfortunate but everybody has to deal with outliers everywhere and anywhere.

77645,comment,77470,77626,0,0,jey,,,"I think we need a cultural shift that places less emphasis on grades and college, and more emphasis on results and direction. I think most people will still go to college, but there need to be socially endorsed options for people who don't want to go to college, or can't handle college. But yeah, I agree that the educational system needs to be fixed, majorly.<p>My mom still wishes I had a college degree so that I would have the stamp of being a bona fide ""educated person"". She knows I am doing fine and that I have options in life, but she thinks it'd be great if I went back and finished my BS. At least she gave up on the idea that some day I'd grow up to be a neurosurgeon... :-)",1194557350

77639,comment,77608,77634,0,0,shayan,,,"you are laughing as if you are very confident about your answer ... well I am not as sure as you are what exactly PG does ... but I doubt TC calls up PG or anyone else for that matter on daily basis to find out whats new... and maybe PG doesn't do it but a lot of other VC's do (check this interview video with Michael Arrington about how to get on TC <a href=""http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/11/how_to_get_in_t.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/11/how_to_get_in_t.html</a> ) ... if I am going to work with YC I would <i>expect</i> them to help me with these kind of stuff ... I mean that is the whole point of YC (don't start with saying they are not a PR team and they are not there to create news for you, <i>I know that</i>) .. but the way YC is structured (which I think is great) is to mostly give you advice and support ... And this kind of support could mean more than anything else to help you launch your business, create traction and gain users, specially with Disqus that is late in the game, and needs the support of bloggers, and has many competition, and there is only a need of one of these services on each blog, and it has been proven that its not so easy to get dominance in this field",1194556572

I think it is a really good way to improve one's thinking skills -- granted, it does not measure your complete skill set(as programming isn't just algorithms), but algorithms <i>are</i> essential. <p>I think most people in the web 2.0 space are in it mainly for the money. The applications themselves are mostly pretty trivial from an algorithmic point of view, so I am really curious what's your opinion on this.<p>Or is everybody just on the road to change the world (with apps like <i>twitter</i>), and doesn't care about competitions like this(where hacking and bright solutions are still appreciated)?",1194556223

I think <i>they are good</i> but I don't see how they are so different from other ones... specially since they are so late in the game  ... when you are late and you have a product that has social aspects to it, you need to do a lot more than being good in order to compete ... you have a major disadvantage and thats network effects (maybe not <i>as</i> crucial here since no one has really gained it yet, but once someone does its very hard to compete) ...  also its not that easy to convince a blogger to switch from their current commenting system to a new one, specially that they have created an archive for themselves, and many of the current systems do not let you move your content around (i.e. at the end of the day you don't really own your comments) ",1194556070

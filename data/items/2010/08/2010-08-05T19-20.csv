Now ask yourself some questions:<p>1) Did you see any other ""civilian"" vehicles or civilians on the street in the footage?  No.  Where do you think the ""civilians"" and their vehicles were?  The answer is, they were at home, hunkered down, because they knew there was fighting going on.  There had been fighting going on in this neighborhood for weeks.<p>That's a ""reasonable"" reaction to living in a fucking war zone.  That's what I'd do.  That's probably what you'd do.  And if I had kids, it sure as fuck is what I would do.  The last thing I would do is put my kids in a car and drive around in it as some kind of a mobile aid station.  Even if my best friend was sitting their in the street, bleeding out, I wouldn't risk my kids lives to pick him up in a war zone.<p>Furthermore, if you watched the entire video, and I suspect you didn't, you'd find that the same Apache crew was tracking another black and unmarked ""civilian""  vehicle just a few minutes before they fired on the Reuters journalists and guess what?  That other vehicile (which may have been the same one) dropped off armed insurgents into a firefight.<p>So yes, Apache crew belief may have been incorrect -- though there is ample evidence to support that it was correct -- but it wasn't ""unreasonable.""<p>Listen, I think you're angry about war.  War sucks.  It's terrible.  And I'm glad most of the fighting seems to be over in Iraq and that we'll get the hell out of there soon.  But Assange edited that video to make US forces look like murders, which isn't the truth.  They are just normal guys doing a very, very difficult job, and who sometimes make mistakes.<p>You want to be angry, get angry at Bush and Obama.<p>Wikileaks got it wrong, intentionally.",1281038329

If you're a founder in the middle of raising a round, the round is the top idea in your mind, which means working on the company isn't. If a round takes 2 months to close, which is reasonably fast by present standards, that means 2 months during which the company is basically treading water. That's the worst thing a startup could do.<p>So if investors want to get the best deals, the way to do it will be to close faster. Investors don't need weeks to make up their minds anyway. We decide based on about 10 minutes of reading an application plus 10 minutes of in person interview, and we only regret about 10% of our decisions. If we can decide in 20 minutes, surely the next round of investors can decide in a couple days.</i><p>This 20 minute figure is missing the point.  What matters here -- to founders at least -- isn't how much time YC spends on the startup.  What matters is how long the startup spends on YC.  I don't know how long the average group spends filling out the YC application form, but I'm sure it's quite a bit longer than 20 minutes.<p>(Back of the envelope calculation: Suppose a typical group spends 3 hours filling out investment-application paperwork per investor they're pitching; investors take 1 out of every 20 applicants; and a startup wants to take money from 5 investors.  Then they've just spent 300 hours -- over a month -- filling out application forms, and it's probably going to be 2 months before they can focus on something other than raising money again.)",1281037473

Now a 1 or 2 penny difference on a several million bond flow may seem unimportant, but it is unfortunately very important because the first thing anyone in finance does to verify that two numbers match is look at the first digits, the length of the number, and the pennies.  If those agree, you move on.<p>So those insignificant penny differences are unfortunately the first thing that gets noticed.  Been there, done that, not fun.",1281035674

I'm writing a program for a problem traditionally tackled by Natural Language Processing and after stumbling through a bunch of academic papers about parse trees and context free grammars, it was obvious I'd need to take the plunge and learn this stuff from the beginning.

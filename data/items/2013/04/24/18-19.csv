Sometimes 10gb input data will produce many billions of records to reduce (if you're looking at combinations of things).<p>Basically, if your computation would never exceed memory on a single machine, then it is more processor efficient to code a more simple multi processing method and run on a single box than to code a map reduce on a cluster.<p>But what if you're not sure of the input data size?

The difference here isn't a ton, but may affect real-time applications. The packets are also smaller, so less overhead if you're sending many.<p>The biggest difference I saw is that when the client or server needs to send several quick requests (many within a couple second), long polling breaks down. From the spec ([2]), ""Once the server sends a long poll response, typically the client immediately sends a new long poll request."" This delay can add up, and is not pure full duplex. Chunked responses help for server -> client, but client -> server still has the same issues.<p>[1] <a href=""http://eng.42go.com/secure-websockets-vs-https-benchmark/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eng.42go.com/secure-websockets-vs-https-benchmark/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-loreto-http-bidirectional-07#section-2.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-loreto-http-bidirectional-0...</a>",1366829863

5603258,comment,5602552,5603164,10,0,patio11,,,"<i>What are some ""business problems"" that I could solve with RoR?</i><p>Consider a real estate agent.  Real estate agents spend most of their time prospecting for leads.  Leads convert at X% into sales, where the agent earns 6% of the transaction price.  Any system you can deliver for a real estate agent which increases the number of leads they have or the percent which eventually turn into sales solves a problem for them.<p>Consider an insurance company.  Insurance companies have prospects and successfully sell some percentage of them policies, which transfer risks from the insured to them.  The insured occasionally suffer losses, which results in them filing a claim against the insurance company, which the company will investigate and probably pay.  Between the time an insurance company collects payments and pays claims, it has use of the ""float"" created by money which is probabalistically owed to someone but not paid yet on its books, and it can invest this float profitably.  Software can increase the number of prospects they have and/or the percentage of prospects who are successfully convinced to buy policies.  Software can assist (or replace) very expensive human underwriters, who judge whether a particular client is worth taking on and, if so, at what price.  Software can <i>greatly</i> improve underwriting profits.  Software can streamline the costs involved in processing claims.  Software can be used to assist companies in paying out less claims that are actually outside of their policy requirements but which had previously been paid due to error or the infeasibility of adjusting them profitably.  Software can increase the profits of management of float.<p>Consider a SaaS company.  Ignore the product.  There's four numbers of interest in that company: visitors per month, new trials per month, average plan price, and churn rate.  Software can move those numbers up, up, up, and down, respectively.<p>Working in any industry will tend to expose you to a lot of these opportunities.  After you have the mindset, the question is more-or-less as simple as asking an accountant ""How would you look at a company and find where money is being spent?""  I mean, if he were pressed for time, he might say ""By looking"", though there's a longer way to phrase that.",1366829687
5603257,comment,5583410,5584316,1,0,purplelobster,,,"It's a very interesting question, and if you ask most people it comes down to the ""feel"" of the game being very different. It's hard to quantify but I'll give it a try.<p>To put it bluntly, one of the main rules and joys of CS is to shoot people in the head. All else being equal in a firefight, if you are good enough to get a head shot and the other guy can't, you win every time. Part of this is strategy (money/weapon management), tactics (positioning, maneuvering, footstep sounds) and aiming/reaction speed/firefight maneuvering. The main difference in CS:S affects the last category. CS:S added more randomness, changed recoil, changed the spread of bullets and hit boxes. CS:S de-emphasized the head shot, presumably to make the game less challenging to beginners. They changed the physics of grenades, running, jumping making the whole thing feel more sluggish.<p>Then there is the presentation part of it. CS made it very clear when you hit a head shot versus a body shot. For example, a head shot when the other player had no helmet resulted in a big spray of blood. When having a helmet there was a big spark shooting off of the head identifiable from afar, and also a satisfying sound. There was also a very different death animation after a head shot versus a body shot. A head shot would result in the player violently falling backwards, while in CS:S the player would just slouch to the ground like he tripped on a stone.<p>CS:S also added a lot of visual clutter that is nothing but detrimental to gameplay. Adding clutter to a competitive game hides the true important ""signals"" in the game, head shots being one, and just adds noise. This is why pros tend to strip down a game to the bare essentials if they can (look at Q3 for examples of this).<p>Another factor that adds to the ""feel"" is the weapon models and sounds. This is subjective, but the sounds in CS feel more powerful to me. Compare the important weapons like the ak47, the colt, deagle and AWP.<p>These are the reasons that ""pros"" never switched to CS:S, or if they did (usually because of prize money), they promptly switched back. Every issue might seem small, but they add up to a worse experience.<p>Ever since Valve took over CS, they have been going in the direction of making the game easier (giving beginners a chance). They started down this path with CS 1.4-1.6, but much more so with CS:S and now CS:GO. The truth is that if a beginner starts playing CS 1.6 today, he will most likely rage quit way before reaching any level of competency at the game. This is not good for Valve because it discourages new players. But this is the way it has to be if pros will want to stick to the game. There HAS to be a huge difference between a beginner and a pro, otherwise there's just no point in having a competitive game. The other part is also that there is no money to be had in a great 14 year old game that doesn't need much improvement. What CS needs is a better match-making system so that beginners won't rage quit, not changes to the feel of the game or more useless weapons or better graphics.",1366829682

HOWEVER, with bitcoin, marginal mining cost is a function of cumulative supply. As supply reaches 21M, marginal cost goes to infinity, and it doesn't matter what technology you bring to bear. Whereas with gold, technological advances have moved the equivalent of bitcoin's 21M to 42M, 84M, etc. The maximum possible supply <i>increases</i>. Yes, of course at some point the technological maximum will reach the physical maximum, but we aren't there yet.<p>The result of all this is that gold supply has grown with the economy over the past 500 years.

If I live in California, fly to New York, and then go on a shopping spree, I'm going to pay the New York tax rates that will end up going to New York. The store doesn't ask me where I'm from, charge me California tax rates, and then send the money to California. That would be absurd.<p>I also can't claim that, since I live in California, I shouldn't pay any New York sales taxes. I'd be laughed out of the store (""interstate commerce"" be damned).<p>Wouldn't it make more sense for an online retailer to charge their <i>local</i> sales tax rate for <i>everyone</i>?

It seems that even top companies offer maybe 3 weeks vacation, which just seems pitifully small to me these days. I don't wanna sit around trying to figure out how to optimally use my remaining 1.79 weeks of vacation time, I just wanna do a good job and take time off when I need or want to.<p>I see this argument about unlimited vacation pretty often, and I think the people making this argument think they are out-clevering a clever idea. But it comes down to the organization's culture -- if you work for a place where taking time off is encouraged, then you feel free to take vacations and others do too. If you don't work in that sort of place, it doesn't matter what your allotted vacation time is because you won't use it anyway. Or if you do, you won't enjoy it.<p>Here's the real problem in a tech context, though -- conferences. If you can't get away, you can't go to conferences, and you'll end up forfeiting the knowledge and outside perspectives you get from going to conferences. It's just not the same thing at all as learning on your own.<p>I mean, I'm not in a situation where I think my tiny company will one day be worth untold billions. Maybe in that situation you need to keep your nose to the grindstone. But I think that sounds like kind of a grim existence.<p>I will say this, though: if you have a balanced life to begin with, the idea of laying on a beach somewhere kinda loses its urgency. Vacations become less necessary to keep your sanity or whatever, which is great. But there still is the need to step away and see something different for a while.

Once a critical mass of users had perused the images, Reddit could aggregate the results, and pass them on to the authorities. (The results of the voting wouldnt even have to be made public, if people were concerned about false accusations.) This would take advantage of the crowds ability to filter through lots of images quickly, while also preserving the diversity and independence that make crowds smart. The point of this wouldnt be to compete with, let alone replace, the work of official investigators, but rather to provide, as it were, another set of eyes, one that might see something that investigators missed.<p>If Reddit were looking for a model to follow, it could use NASAs Clickworkers experiment...</i><p>For any of this to work, ""Reddit"" would need to be an organization with a top-down command and control hierarchy, not an online forum where any user can create a new subforum at any time.<p>In this idealized world of Reddit investigations, who is overseeing the crowd-sourcing and handling the aggregation?",1366827495

(I don't know any English cases on that, but there may be US ones I'm not familiar with.

Seems to me that the effect of that would be to make the service a standing offer on Google's part. Analogy: a sign on a shack saying ""Come in and take a biscuit if you view the advert on the wall"". The consideration isn't in return for a promise to continue to provide services. If the shack owner removed the shack one day, you couldn't sue him for breach of contract.<p>Wheras if you've paid money for a service and they don't provide it, they're in breach, full stop. (Even if they claim you're in breach, they have to notify you and give you a reasonable time to cure it).<p>IANAL, and my consideration analysis might be completely wrong.

It's a lot harder than you think. For participants, poor sound quality ""gets in the way""; good sound ""just works.""  And a single piece of (expensive) office videoconferencing hardware is only a small part of the goal of minimizing distracting ambient noises and maximizing intelligible speech.<p>As you've discovered, sound quality is the hardest aspect of making video conferencing a good experience for speakers and listeners on both sides of the video link. It's easy to jack in a big-screen TV to a laptop for viewers at the back of the room. But the quality of the sound is shaped by the interplay of acoustics in both rooms. Reverberation within both conference rooms as well as noise captured by the microphones lead to poor sound quality.<p>Here's what you're up against:\n<a href=""http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/telepresence/endpoint/misc/user_guide/video_conferencing_room_acoustics_guidelines_ver01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/telepresence/endpoint/misc/u...</a><p>So the solution to the problem is not a better piece of office conferencing equipment, and it's not DIY acoustics management - it's a sound professional who has the skills necessary to tailor a solution for your specific office environment.<p>Large corporations hire an audio design consultant. But for your budget, ask an experienced local sound technician--someone who works with natural sound for a living--to come by and offer their advice. Inspect the office location together and review with him/her the specifics of how you intend to use the space.  A good soundie will: consider all the factors that shape the room's acoustics, including floor, wall, ceiling dimensions and materials; evaluate all sources of ambient noise; decide on choice and placement of wired/wireless mic(s) and speakers, an inexpensive (automatic) mixer. Sound recording pros - whether on an indie movie set or at a local radio station - routinely make the best use of the available budget; an experienced soundie will get you better sound, usually for less money, often with a mix of more creative solutions that can include inexpensive, low-tech sound modifiers for the room's acoustics.",1366826679

They licensed tech from SRI and even had another group build the app itself.<p>That aside, summarization is a relatively old field of study (in CS) and there is tons of good information to read and even many free libraries. My suggestion would be to try out an unsupervised learning algorithm such as LDA. You still need training data, but you don't need to label it with categories. The downside is that you will have no control over what it learns. Still, classic examples of LDA involve classifying news sources.<p>For standard linear classification, understanding Bayes is important, but for actual implementation look at something like liblinear and use logistic regression with regularization. The difference between Bayes and LR is that Bayes optimizes learning the underlying probability distribution while LR optimizes ""getting the classification right"", otherwise known as optimizing the expectation. Regularization controls for overfitting and there can be a <i>big</i> difference between the type you use (L1 vs L2) and the settings.

It used to be a buggier, and slower, and generally <i>worse</i> web browser, but every time someone made an improvement, the GPL made those improvements Free; When Apple improved it, it was the GPL forced them to make those changes available to everyone else, and while the code being available is what helped Google start their web browser, it was the GPL that fed those improvements back into the community.<p>Perhaps Mozilla (open source, but not GPL) would have remained an acceptable way to search wikipedia, but I struggle to believe it would become good enough to be embedded in nearly every operating system and WWW-capable device.",1390597195

I wouldn&#x27;t have posted it if I hadn&#x27;t.<p>Most computer software named pySOMETHING is Python but I didn&#x27;t assume and went and looked in the repo.<p>I said that my feelings about code written in PHP were unfair and you are right that ease of deployment is a valid reason to develop in it. I did not say that all code developed in it or developers for it are garbage but I do treat it as a slight warning flag. The big thing is that I don&#x27;t want to learn enough to be working around gotchas in the language.<p>Yes C or C++ aren&#x27;t the obvious choice for a web framework and would probably put me off to some extent but I am sufficiently familiar with them to evaluate how clean the code is and tinker here or there if necessary. Of languages that I don&#x27;t currently know well that I might be prepared to learn some more to tinker are the functional programming languages (Scala, Haskell, ML) I might be interested in anyway or JS/Node.<p>In terms of the stupidity of using a C/C++ based web framework Apache can probably be used as a basic web framework and I&#x27;ve heard about people using Postgres to do the templating not just managing the data so it isn&#x27;t implausible to use C/C++.",1390597138

Is this someone really knowledgeable, or is it some dumb newbie? Sometimes it&#x27;s easy to tell, but other times it&#x27;s very hard.<p>Then there&#x27;s also the issue of reviews with an &quot;agenda&quot; - self-explanatory, no need for me to say more.<p>One thing that seems to work is to see someone I know using a gadget, <i>to actually see</i> that gadget being used, and talk to that individual briefly about the gadget. The info I get this way seems quite a bit more trustworthy than online reviews. Of course, this could also be an artifact of the way we form opinions.<p>Another empirical observation: on Amazon, a significant amount of negative reviews is typically an indication of a real issue. But the absence of negative reviews doesn&#x27;t say much. Positive reviews do not appear to be quite as relevant-information-rich, unless there&#x27;s an extremely large amount of them.",1390597134

7117888,comment,7116764,7117705,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"I trust some reviews of some products by some people. I differentiate. For example, for car reviews I read Edmunds reviews but don&#x27;t trust all of their opinions. They don&#x27;t try to do anything with car reliability which really sucks, but they can&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s what until you&#x27;ve owned the car for 10 years, and they are reviewing new cars. I trust my mechanic friend much more here since he can actually look under the hood and tell me if the type of car has a transmission that&#x27;s prone to go bad, or an engine that&#x27;s going to burn oil. It&#x27;s possible that he&#x27;s pulling his opinions out of his own biases, but what he says usually makes internal sense so I feel better if he tells me something is good or bad.<p>I don&#x27;t trust good restaurant reviews, and only trust bad ones if they cite specific issues, like using wrong ingredients, etc. I trust my friends and family when they say a place is good or bad much more because I know their tastes and I can ask followup questions.<p>For electronics, I pretty much don&#x27;t trust anyone with anything unless something is backed by the manufacturer. I only trust Apple products because of Apple Care. Everyone has had a bad experience with a laptop, a phone, a tablet, a mouse, a USB cable, etc. It&#x27;s not worth listening to most times since it&#x27;s usually a horror story from 10 years ago about a company that who&#x27;s had their entire manufacturing line re-tooled since.<p>On Amazon for a generic product, the biggest indication to me is if there are lots of reviews. That means lots of people own the product. If most of the reviews are one star, it&#x27;s a crappy product. If not, it could be good or bad and I personally find very little correlation between the way I perceive a product and its Amazon reviews.",1390596439

I&#x27;m going to pay for software that helps me get my work done faster and better. Because at the end of the day, I appreciate good tools, not ideals.<p>There may come a day when I try to make my own &quot;free&quot; software project, but if I do, it will be because I really want to make a world class tool in that category, and I feel that the free model is the best for that tool. But I will continue to choose my tools based on what they allow me to do, not their source code license, and the proprietary tools I do use offer me more advantages <i>despite</i> being closed source than their open source equivalents.<p>[1] Don&#x27;t bother posting arguments about this or that free software package in these categories.

But forking to GPL would a) be a bit rude, and perhaps more importantly b) most likely just be a dead fork.

Often, these are the same devs who are leading open source projects of their own.  When they need to create a proprietary project to pay the bills, a GPL-licensed library is usually the end of the road for their project, since they won&#x27;t have the manpower to replicate it on their own.<p>Aside from these issues, do we really care that we can&#x27;t access the source of Subtle Text?

The later means that whatever speed you have on or below the event horizon, you can&#x27;t reach infinity. The former is just an impression by an outside observer because in his observation the time has stopped on the event horizon, while a stone thrown up from below the event horizon would cross the event horizon just fine on the way up and on the way down and would return back down successfully in its proper time (the point of &quot;inescapability&quot; is that the stone would always return). While above the horizon, the stone can interact with other stuff there and result of this interaction can be observed  outside (doesn&#x27;t mean on practice by us today or tomorrow :).<p>Many models seems to treat the event horizon as &quot;uncrossable&quot;. For example  quantum information disappearance - matter goes in, evaporates as Hawking.

However, proprietary software can have many benefits. Many if not most successful software businesses have made great contributions to open-source and the development of free software. I know for a fact that a huge amount of linux development is driven by for-profit companies. If a company can make a profit, make an excellent product, and pay it forward by contributing to open projects as well, it sounds like a win-win to me. This might violate RMS&#x27;s axiom that only free software is good, but as Hitchens says, &quot;What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.&quot;",1390593659

The issue is that in that scenario, your head <i>isn&#x27;t</i> on an escaping trajectory: the nerve signals from your feet might be moving &quot;outward&quot;, but your head will be moving inward, and the signal will only get to your brain after your brain has also crossed the horizon.<p>Now, if you were wearing some sort of rocket collar that fired powerfully just before your head crossed the horizon and carried it safely away from the black hole (or even just held it there), you&#x27;re right: you wouldn&#x27;t ever receive that signal from your feet. But I&#x27;m pretty sure that would be the least of your worries! (And you <i>would</i> notice your missing feet. And torso.)

HTML browser with Javascript, plugins and capability to perform HTTP GET, POST methods was designed to be easy to be programmed.<p>So the hard part are<p>1. The right UI that makes the task easy.<p>2. The accumulation of data and/or consturction of the system behind the HTTP server that does the task. And in case you have millions simultaneous users, you will have a lot of fun to find efficient ways to perform the task. (Efficiency in both computing resources consumptions and economical cost)<p>3. Building the system described in 1 and 2 fast enough to have feedback from users frequently and iterate it fast so they will always expecting something good/useful/cool shows up every now and then.<p>4. Good quality of service. Whether there is only one user or billions of users in the world use the system. The system shouldn't make them frustrated in complete the task. The system shouldn't waste their time in life by waiting a broken page.",1217651811

That never goes wrong!</i><p>The only cryptography I'm talking about using here is ""if the file I download has the right SHA256 hash, it's the right file"" -- and that's far more ""time-tested"" than SSL is.<p>(And in any case, the rule against inventing ones' own cryptosystems is usually stated as ""until you've shown that you can break other peoples' cryptography"" -- so it doesn't apply to me.)",1217651178

But many eyes only makes bugs shallow if the eyes are open -- and 99.999% of people who use OpenSSL have never looked at the code.<p>One of the dirty secrets of open source is that there are a lot of projects which almost everybody uses by very few people actually develop.<p><i>Your app has only been seen by you and perhaps a small team.

2819125,comment,2818349,2819003,4,0,jerf,,,"Actually, you can sort of formalize the argument: Software is eligible for copyright. Therefore, the law <i>already</i> recognizes that it is an expressive activity.<p>A mechanical device is <i>already</i> not eligible for copyright.<p>Software is the only thing I know covered by both patents and copyright. Sometimes people deny this to me when I say this online, but I haven't yet heard anybody come up with a concrete example that stood up to scrutiny. Is it really so stunning that two systems never designed to mesh, patents and copyright, turn out to in fact <i>not</i> mesh and produce a big mess? Is it really so horrible that software be only copyrightable and not patentable? Very few people are arguing that software should not be covered by any sort of IP protection, and I suspect the non-zero set of such people would be further shrunk if patents were removed from the equation. (Though I also guarantee, not eliminated.)",1311890379

I agree with you on this part. I kept scratching my head when I was first introduced to Enterprise java beans.

Nil should accept any method and return nil.<p>This is the pattern that Objective-C embraces, and it works very well. You can chain method calls to nil and get nil as the result of the expression, should any method return nil. You end up with cleaner, more readable code. Sure, it makes some edge cases harder to debug, but not by very much. In this case, the benefits far outweigh the code. You'd simply end up with:<p><pre><code>  def admin_of?(project)
    membership_for(project).admin? || false
  end

Additionally since nil is falsy, you could even skip the `|| false`, and any `if u.admin_of? p` statement would still work. (Not recommended, but just pointing it out.)<p><pre><code>  def admin_of?(project)

I downvoted you too, because your claim is trollish and wrong.<p>I have been writing Java since I was 13. I am 23 now. I have been paid for code written in C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, F#, and Python. My personal projects are written in Scala, C#, C++, and JavaScript. I emphatically <i>do not</i> use Ruby for personal or professional projects (unless forced, with regards to the latter). From this reasonably broad body of experience, I am quite certain that I would be vastly more productive if <i>the language wasn't consistently getting in my way</i>. As it is, I have an unhealthy number of vim macros to deal with all the boilerplate that Java foists upon a developer. It is insufficiently expressive without them, and once those macros are applied the resultant boilerplate code (method objects, for example) greatly decrease readability and increase potential failures, due to more difficulty in conceptualizing and reviewing the code.<p>His posts also belie a lack of perspective. He doesn't ""write with anyone else,"" yet I would venture to guess that the primary use case of Java, today, is in environments with more than one developer. He doesn't ""use 3rd party libs"", which suggests a lack of familiarity with his own ecosystem of tools, let alone those that provide these features that others (including myself) have indicated are part of what makes Java unpleasant to use. (Seriously--if you're not using Apache Commons at the <i>very</i> least, there is a credible argument that you're probably reinventing wheels and Doing It Wrong.) And he has a critical lack of perspective about what are generally considered basic programming constructs: if you think closures and first-class functions exist to ""make some developers happy,"" <i>you are ignorant of why they exist in the first place</i>. Do you think that now-very-standard tools like map, fold, etc. would be generally adopted if the only way to use them was Java-boilerplate code-vomit?<p>.<p>pivo said it nicely upthread: <i>""I'm tired of visually parsing 20 lines of a Java method and filtering out all the boilerplate iteration junk just to find the one or two lines that actually do something. Often this kind of thing can be reduced to a few simple, relevant lines when you have closures, for example.""</i> And he is right. Because this is what Java makes you do. In 2011, it has been surpassed in terms of flexibility, expressiveness, and utility by other JVM languages that allow you to pull in Java objects and work with them, but write your code in a way that is much more pleasant.<p>.<p>But no--clearly we're all kids, writing Ruby and JavaScript.

Yes it's a problem, but buffering is the only magic that'll help.<p>If the problem is that middleware authors can't be bothered to implement the whole spec because it's too hard, then submit a patch.  I promise you that WSGI is easier to implement than HTTP/1.1  In fact, I would argue that it's as easy as possible.  If it were easier, we probably wouldn't be having this discussion, because it wouldn't have been powerful enough to have been adopted.<p>Or write a middleware container that transforms the WSGI api into something you think is more sane, then implement middleware in thate.<p>Build the next great thing on top of WSGI, because in the end, the answer is either WSGI, something that's architecturally equivalent, or else each framework has to have its own compression, session, and other libraries.

This is an absolutely excellent form of protection when the expression of the idea is a huge part of its value.  A piece of music, or a novel IS its expression.  If you rewrite James Joyce's Ulysses in your own words you have lost Joyce's expression which is precisely what people value in the reading.  Hence a work in which the expression is critical to its value is well protected by copyright.<p>Software is not such a work. If someone spends years refining an invention and someone else reverse engineers it and yet changes the expression of the work copyright is no protection whatsoever because no-one using the work gives a rat's ass about the underlying expression.<p>The idea that copyright is a meaningful protection for software is so laughable that anyone daft enough to take the idea seriously is clearly so appallingly badly informed that they don't deserve to be taken seriously.",1311886853

In fact, these are just chemicals in solution--none of the intracellular systems with their own local chemistries are modeled here, and those are maddeningly complicated in their own right. If you think our biological understanding has progressed to the point where gleaning simple information about single edges in this graph are elementary, think again.<p>Most people have heard about the genome, for which we now have punchcard-level technology to deal with. The methylome sits on top of that, annotating the genome with important dynamic state. Then there&#x27;s the transcriptome--utilizing nucleic acids, it&#x27;s just one instance of intracellular messaging. The RNA field is extremely complicated due to its chemistry, which makes it annoyingly difficult to study. (Also, RNA isn&#x27;t just messaging.)<p>Want to get at some systems-level interactions? There are the metabolome, reactome, interactome... And we&#x27;re still at the sub-cellular level. I didn&#x27;t even mention proteins, which seem to be <i>somewhat</i> important to the study of cancer. (Actually, entire immunological systems are. Yet we&#x27;re still discovering new immune cell types and guessing at roles...)<p>If it wasn&#x27;t something you already had an appreciation for, you can now see that the biology state machine is beyond your wildest dreams complicated. And really, this is glossing over things. You have to take into account a metric ton of chemistry. Unlike programming, nothing ever gets abstracted away in biology.<p>Welcome to the defining problem of the human race--solving it, if we ever do, will likely be our grandest moment.<p>If I could make the bet, I&#x27;d wager we won&#x27;t have a cure to cancer in 200 years.",1408683532

Indeed, if most opposed taxation, wouldn&#x27;t they simply vote against it?<p>The problem is, it&#x27;s kind of a vicious cycle. Because state cannot exist without taxation, it is in its best interest to never bring up this question: that is, it may be okay to occasionally reduce one particular tax, but overall, the idea that taxation is extortion would simply never be raised. Therefore, much like in medieval times, people are raised to believe that they cannot survive without state (god) and that society would descend into violent anarchy without a state (people would lose their moral compass without faith in god).<p>Another problem is how state redefines things when it comes to taxing people. Taxes are always tied to good activities you perform, not bad activities states perform. That is, if people had to fill tax reports in which they saw &quot;$200 for killing a bunch of kids in Iraq&quot; instead of &quot;$200 for selling your car&quot; they might change their minds.<p>So, to sum it up: threat of force + propaganda from the young age (done in schools on that very same taxpayers money) = vicious cycle that is hard to break.",1408682439

I took three classes this summer, which is the closest thing they have to full-time. I can say without hesitation that it would be an enormous financial mistake for most people to join the program.<p>Just a quick overview of some of the problems they have:<p>- Poorly considered curriculum. Our data visualization class involved no d3js or training with data viz tools. Students were told to teach themselves the tools in their spare time while studying data viz theory (Edward Tufte, etc.) in class.<p>- Cost. There&#x27;s absolutely no way to justify the $60k price tag, especially with no in-state tuition option.<p>- Choice of instructors. They&#x27;re trying to increase the size of the program too quickly, while throwing in new instructors with zero teaching experience. These instructors also have part-time or full-time jobs outside of MIDS, so I didn&#x27;t even get my grades back for assignments from the first month by two weeks before finals. It would often take a minimum of 2-4 weeks to get grades back.<p>I&#x27;ve officially withdrawn from MIDS, and I&#x27;m attending Zipfian this fall.

If the majority of people in any unit of democratic government (city, state, province, whatever) truly believes that that said government should not collect* taxes, how do those taxes exist? One of the more recent examples I can think of is in Arlington, TX, where taxes were raised to contribute towards a new football stadium[0]. There&#x27;s research on the books suggesting that such moves don&#x27;t pay off financially for cities in the long run, as well as disputes about campaign funding[1], but somehow I imagine a truly <i>moral</i> issue like shooting people in the head would be a harder election to swing than one about a question of utility‚Äîpay some money, get a stadium, and all the non-financial benefits many people get from that.<p>*which I will also note is a quite different stance from &#x27;will jump to pay them without any grumbling, reminders, or future coercion&#x27;<p>[0] <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=1914997"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=1914997</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/in-stadium-building-spree-u-s-taxpayers-lose-4-billion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/in-stadium-building...</a>",1408680953

With ElasticSearch there are some amazing tools that are available.  A few that come to mind are Kibana and LogStash.  Given that we have our own API layer on top of ElasticSearch, we are not able to support these tools even though we are using ElasticSearch at our core.  This is most unfortunate.<p>There are many reasons why we put an API layer on top of Azure Search.  One key reason is that for our particular customers, we found that there were things we could do in our API that could simplify the interaction with Search.  In fact, we have a system called Scoring Profiles that allow you to easily (I hope) set weights on important fields and attributes to quickly tune the results of your search based on what is important to you.  No coding required.  Another reason we don&#x27;t just expose ElasticSearch is that ElasticSearch allows you to run random code.  This is generally not a great idea in a PaaS service and can often lead to issues.  There are a number of other reason that I&#x27;ll skip for now.<p>We still need to do some thinking in this area.  I hope we can get Azure Search to a point that we can enable tools such as Kibana and LogStash to work with our service without compromising the goals of what we are trying to build.  Not only would this allow us to really open up the types of things people can do with the service, but I suspect it would really help reduce concern around vendor lock in.

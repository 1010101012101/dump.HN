Combined they grant you the power to inject new syntax / domain specific languages (DSLs) directly into your code.   Any new syntax you create can look like normal lisp or can have different syntax evaluation rules like infix math notation [1].   A number of years ago I did a short write-up on stack overflow giving a basic explanation of how macros work in common lisp which may be worth a read [2].<p>Macros in general work by being a syntax tree -> syntax tree transformation.   The neat trick is it&#x27;s not a static pattern like C - you can leverage functions, conditions, etc to build that syntax tree.<p>As for comprehensions themselves, if you want to see the power of lisp look at the loop macro.   It&#x27;s a single macro yet gives you the power of normal control loops, list comprehensions, for-each all rolled into one package.

For such a generally free thinking crowd, there&#x27;s a lot of flat out hate for the open office here.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve seen it work well (where I&#x27;m at now), and I&#x27;ve seen it work badly (two jobs ago).  I&#x27;ve also seen the same in separate offices.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t really find that age or experience tends to matter that much as to where it works or doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s more about the work you&#x27;re doing, and the company you&#x27;re doing it for.<p>Some dev projects - those heavy on the back end especially, or requiring lots of sheer coding manpower over critical thinking, I think they definitely don&#x27;t gain anything from the open office.  The same could be said as well for the truly complex coding work out there - which, honestly, is less and less a reality.<p>If you&#x27;re wiring up pages that do some middle tier logic or dealing with heavily interactive sites, which I think is what many of us do day to day, rather than the super intense, super difficult coding work that we all wish we did, I think the collaborative benefits can outweigh the risk of interruption.<p>If you&#x27;re actually doing that big brain work, or really working on something that needs complete concentration, then yes, being able to zone in on it interruption free is definitely a good thing.<p>Like every other process, or tool, it depends on the context and the problem you&#x27;re solving.  And like most problems, you need the right person to use that tool or process.  So does it work for every scenario, and every person?  No, definitely not.  The same can be said for a closed office as well.<p>Bottom line - right people, right place, for the right task at hand.",1417661712

Your private key is encrypted with your password. This way your login password receives the status of the private key.

My belief was along the lines of &quot;if you don&#x27;t throw away everything and start over at least once you&#x27;re doing it wrong,&quot; with the idea being that coding too fast results in complex, un-elegant solutions. Finally, in a fast-paced environment, you simply have to check in with each other, and having to schedule meetings or calls just sucks. The team I&#x27;m in right now is not co-located and we&#x27;re losing tons of productivity.<p>And yet.

Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, lest they be discovered. They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.<p>They don&#x27;t particularly care when the attack will be, just that they agree. It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce an attack time, which we&#x27;ll call the &quot;plan&quot;, and whatever plan is heard first will be the official plan. The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different plans at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.<p>They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general receives whatever plan he hears first, he sets his computer to solve a difficult hash-based proof-of-work problem that includes the plan in its hash. The proof-of-work is difficult enough that with all of them working at once, it&#x27;s expected to take 10 minutes before one of them finds a solution and broadcasts it to the network. Once received, everyone adjusts the hash in their proof-of-work computation to include the first solution, so that when they find the next proof-of-work, it chains after the first one. If anyone was working on a different plan, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.<p>After about two hours, the plan should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce in the allotted time. At the least, most of them had to have seen the plan, since the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.",1417659842

7902159,comment,7900657,7901322,2,0,sytelus,,,"Like most other exponential growth patterns, there is suddenly HUGE number of people now wanting to use ML but don&#x27;t have necessary background. Pretty much every other enterprisy developer who had been happily spending their lives pushing data from RDBMS to/from UI now wants to try out ML for something or other. Unfortunately current state of ML framework is a minefield. If you don&#x27;t know your precision from recall or confusion table really confuses you or have no clue when you have been merely overfitting all along, you are screwed.<p>I can see huge market if you can bottle down complexities of ML in a nice easy to use package. A very easy to use ML service or tool would allows you to import your data with few clicks, apply normalization such as stemming or edit distance by pick-n-choose without writing any code, has nice generic featurization library,  can run tons of algorithms with large number of parameter sweeps, does automatic feature selection, takes care of maintaining test and validation sets etc. This kind of thingy would be super popular. My guess is that it has to run in cloud because it eliminates all the setup and updates plus doing what I described even on moderate size data sets usually takes hours on single machine. Now throw in plug-n-pray deep learning algos which even few ML experts are familiar with and can require significant GPU based infrastructure.<p>Can this be reality? In my opinion, this is more in line of those graphical tools that claims you can create programs without having to learn programming. It&#x27;s impressive when you do demo but don&#x27;t last long in battle grounds. Ultimately, if you want to write program, you will need to get your hands and cloths dirty with oil stinks.

7902156,comment,7899220,7900956,1,0,zackmorris,,,"I just meant that OpenCL/CUDA are moving towards a narrower scope than what I would like.  There is too much emphasis on manually arranging your data with the correct interleaving, or doing things in batches, pipelined in just the right order.  It all reminds me of DSP, which I was never a huge fan of.  That&#x27;s because all of the supposed gains can easily be replicated with a general purpose language and an order of magnitude more computing power (which is easily attainable with billions of transistors at your disposal, getting cheaper every year).<p>You are right about memory bandwidth though.  I&#x27;m excited that memory has come so far, with wide channels running at a GHz or more.  But, that has come at the expense of latency.  I think this problem is intractable, because everything is moving toward data centers with even slower interconnect.<p>I’m reaching here, but I think the endgame will be memory that works more like bittorrent, where the latency won’t be how far the nearest neighbor is, but how much the data differs from what you already have.  Then we can eliminate most of the problems with slow interconnect and move to a big dumb hash system that uses diffs but results in orders of magnitude higher throughput.  If processing is really not a bottleneck, then this will be trivial.",1402963034

So yes, you need to analyze your customer data, have a great idea, smart people, and so on, but it may still not be enough, and there&#x27;s no way to really predict which startup amongst the many hitting the necessary conditions for success will actually go on to be an apple or a google.

Vancouver has a similar issue, where the drinking/clubbing/partying district, Granville Street in the heart of Vancouver&#x27;s downtown, is a huge destination for partygoers from all over the region; not just Vancouver, but outlying cities and suburbs as well; a city of around 600k has to take on the responsibility of hosting the drunks, clubgoers, partiers, concertgoers, etc. of a region of 2.8m people, and many of those party people live and work outside of the city, pay taxes outside of the city, pay rent outside of the city, and only come downtown to party.<p>That results in an increased cost of policing the area (since all drinking and clubbing establishments are forced together), the increased cost of cleaning (everything from garbage and smashed bottles to a surprising amount of vomit), increased regulation, transportation congestion, medical care, etc.<p>It also results in a neighbourhood which goes from a mostly pedestrian mall-esque area full of shops and boutiques to a shitshow where you might get punched for no reason (as happened to a friend&#x27;s boyfriend as they were walking home from the movie theatre; shattered his jaw, which had to be wired shut).<p>The problem isn&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;outsiders are bad&#x27;, but rather that these people come downtown, drink, have a good time (or a bad time), but feel no responsibility for the area. They don&#x27;t have to walk through it after a bad night to get to work and see the catastrophe they caused, so they may never realize the social and economic impact of bad behaviour. If it were their mailbox kicked open or their doorstep puked on or their neighbour hospitalized, it might encourage more restraint, or at least more consideration, but unfortunately that&#x27;s not usually the case.<p>I think that&#x27;s generally the problem with the &#x27;drinking district&#x27; in a lot of cities; people from everywhere <i>but</i> there go there to party and have fun, and if they don&#x27;t, they cause problems and then head on home, lost in the crowd, and probably don&#x27;t even remember it the next day.",1402960793

Wacom is a terrible example for an anti-patent rant. Digitizing pen input is really hard to get right. N-trig has been working to come up with their own independent technology for years now. This is exactly the sort of R&D-heavy product development that&#x27;s most endangered by copying.

But there are so many more lines of business where untold billions are being made by companies that go for non-sexy non b2c approaches.<p>What works for YC and what works on the web is a very visible very thin slice of the software world as a whole. In a way you&#x27;re making your life harder if you pursue that particular niche because even though that&#x27;s where all the easy PR and the most visible success stories are it is also where the competition is fierce.<p>B2B is a lot less likely to make you billions.

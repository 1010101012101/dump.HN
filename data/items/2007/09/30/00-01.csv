It seems like more people developing for their platform can only benefit Apple.",1191113946

61172,comment,61157,61157,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I was listening to a podcast (I think) where someone who had recently studied linguistics was saying that Sapir-Whorf has been almost discredited in academic communities for some time, yet it lives on as a ""myth"" for people outside of the academic communities.<p>I just can't find any reference of this. This is pretty common thing, ideas from a long time ago tend to stay in the publics collective memory as still being current. <p>The one that springs to mind is the ""breathing"" you see pregnant-in-labour women doing in hollywood movies (yet this technique was thrown out decades ago as having no effect at all). Yet it lives on in circles of people who aren't experts and repeat it amongst themselves as if they are. <p>A quick search didn't yield anything like this for Sapir-Whorf though.",1191113520
61170,comment,61157,61162,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, I think there is more to it that having invested time in inferior languages. Programming well in higher order languages requires a different kind of thinking from writing simple procedural code and using UML and ""design patterns"" as crutches. I would argue that Python is easier to learn than either C++ or Java, but much harder to master because mastering Python requires one to think differently. The same is true of Lisp, Erlang or Haskell. <p>Sadly I think most people are not taught how to think, but rather how to perform repetitive tasks based on some formula (works great for writing Java).<p>Another problem I think is that most Blub programmers don't program because they love programming and therefore are not willing to put in the time and effort to learn a different way of thinking. <p>Personally I believe programming is an art and as such it requires talent as well as dedication. I'm disappointed that after all this years everyone still thinks programming is some form of science. Software engineering? WTF?",1191112765

61167,comment,61157,61165,0,0,inklesspen,,,"Sorta. PG got it spot on in his article on Blub. The Blub programmer doesn't see Lisp as being more powerful than Blub, he sees it as being equally powerful, only with too many parentheses and maybe some extra features. But he doesn't need those extra features, he's a skilled Blub programmer, and once he learns the Lisp equivalents of his favorite Blub function calls (etc.) he'll happily carry on writing Blub code in Lisp syntax. And that's only if you force him to use Lisp, because he still thinks there's too many parentheses, and anyway Lisp doesn't have an XML-driven build engine like Blub does.",1191112221

Is there a way to grab ALL the data from HackerID? ...""</i><p>Yes. <p>I've been saving the individual files since I've run the system as ISO8602 filename "".xml"" since it started. I'm going to now write some code to store it in a db beats the 4Mb of text files I have.  Also I want to write a quick script to add the archived files to the db. <p><i>""... Users that pg replied to will have a 'knighted' symbol next to them ;-)  ...""</i><p>Nice touch.  What I'm doing is checking if users on the leader board top 30 or top10 or number 1 and adding a star with 10, 30 or 1.  Im also working on filters for 'pg' meaning he's off the board.<p>I tell you what would be nice is to synchronise the snapshot captures (by ISO-8602 time stamps set to Zulu time ie: 2007-09-30T00:16:42Z or now).  This means you can at some later time import any data into a db and do a query by time.<p><i>""... when I read 'name the best hacker news contributers', I thought it is a contest :-) ...""</i><p>Yeah good point. Might have to change/tweak this it a bit. Maybe add a question mark. <p>My objectives at the moment are to <p>- do deep search on hacker by article in <i>""new/""</i> and extract WHO is making comments and build some sort of heirarchy of user interaction with link to comments<p>- do some stats on the hacker data<p>- "" a graphical representation.""

Interesting to see.   The real objective is to release this as data rather than just pages so users can use the data (not sure about RT) to look at things on a particular day.<p>My objectives are different from yours keep up the good work and plz try to make the data free for use by others to use.

61164,comment,61080,61080,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Windows XP is by now a very stable and reliable operating system. As far as I can tell (I have used Vista for about 5 minutes on a friend's machine) there isn't much that Vista offers as an upgrade to XP. Some of the UI ""enhancements"" are pretty much copied straight from OS X and some of the cool features that were promised for Vista were either not included  (WinFS) or available for download in Windows XP.<p>I'm not sure why anyone would consider upgrading to Vista.",1191111865

61162,comment,61157,61157,0,0,inklesspen,,,"Prove it. Sapir-Whorf is fun for sci-fi, but there's no evidence for anything but the most loose variations of it.<p>No, the reason Blub programmers have a hard time picking up more powerful languages is that they have invested time in their skillsets, so even if they were to program in Lisp syntax, they'd still write Blub-in-Lisp code, not using macros, closures, functional programming, etc. Because they never learned about them and don't see the point.<p>The same thing comes up all the time in Python communities; people who don't know Python very well write ""un-Pythonic"" code that doesn't take advantage of the language's best built-in functionality like list comprehensions and generator expressions.<p>Compare:<p># unpythonic way of squaring each element in a list<p>source_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<p>dest_list = []<p>for x in range(len(source_list)):<p><pre><code>    dest_list.append(source_list[x]*source_list[x])\n</code></pre>\n# Pythonic way<p>[x*x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]",1191111623

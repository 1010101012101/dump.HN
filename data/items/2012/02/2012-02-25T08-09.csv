3632554,comment,3629909,3632222,10,0,simonw,,,"Plenty of reasons.<p>Firstly, web app vs web site isn't a binary distinction - it's a gradient. Is Flickr an application or a site? It provides extensive tools for uploading and organising photos... but the bulk of the site is flat pages people use for navigating vast amounts of content.<p>Secondly, URLs really, really matter. Twitter have a big engineering task on now to clean up the mess made when they switched to using broken-URL #!s. The ability to link to things is the most important factor in the Web's success. An application built as a fat JavaScript client that talks to an API is opting out of the URL-driven web.<p>Even if something uses #! or pushState to emulate linkable URLs, if I can't hit a URL with an HTTP client library (not a full-blown JS+DOM implementation) and get back a content representation, it's not a full-blown member of the web - it's no better than content that's been wrapped up in a binary Flash container.<p>Don't think I'm not pro-JavaScript - I'm a big fan of using JavaScript to improve user experience etc (heck, I have code in the first ever release of jQuery). I'm just anti JavaScript being required to consume and manipulate the Web.<p>I'll concede that there are plenty of applications for which a fat client does make sense (image manipulators, data vis tools, possibly interfaces like gmail although I'm continuously infuriated by my inability to open gmail messages in new tabs). But the thinking embraced by the original article, that Rails-style frameworks are on the way out because EVERY site should be built as a fat client, is dangerously short-sighted in my opinion.",1330159711

In over-constrained problems there is no exact solution, but again one needs to impose some optimization to get something ""close enough"" to the desired criteria, according to some norm.

In medieval Iceland the cloth that they made was even legal tender.  Talk about ""making money"" (literally)!<p>I actually see modernist feminism as a response specifically to the fact that the industrial revolution largely completed an economic trend that had been going on since the late Middle Ages, which was the displacement of women economically and the taking over of these industries by men.  Women, deprived of their historical economic place in Western society, had to find a new economic place, and the need for this was the catalyst for women's suffrage, the women entering the factories and schools, and the like.<p>This lead to an extremely male-normal society, though, and it has meant that women are still suffering for that.  The genders cannot be equal where one is normal and the other not.  Note that Robbie Davis-Floyd documents in her (excellent) book ""Birth as an American Rite of Passage"" that in medical textbooks (at least in the early 90's when she was writing this one) that male figures were overrepresented among diagrams of healthy anatomy, while female figures were overrepresented among diagrams of disease.<p>That doesn't mean that there aren't biological differences that don't come into play.  But how those differences manifest is very much tied to culture.  But culture is not without limits--- it is subject to functional imperatives, both biological and social in nature.<p>Consider this:  marriage, as an institution which centers around procreation and childraising, is more universally recognized in ritual practices than funerals are.  There are social imperatives at work even when biological ones are not (certainly there is no biological imperative to get married).<p>The social imperative there is in fact quite obvious when you start looking at differences between paternity and maternity considerations.  Women are mothers if they have given birth.  Men are fathers typically if they are recognized by society or the law as such, and this is only loosely tied to biology (even in the US today--- consider that 52% of never-married mothers never apply for child support, often out of a desire not to have further contact with the putative biological father, but in other cultures a child born out of wife-swapping or wife-loaning is always the child of the woman's husband).  So a social imperative of managing paternity considerations and providing stable economic units for childraising often are decisive here.",1330157109

Also, people are so thrown by complexity, that they assume they aren't capable of taking steps toward figuring something out. a CLI really is NOT that hard.

Lets make it harder.<p>$ ls -a<p>an option. list contents of directory. but ALL of them. still easy.<p>building from the ground up is easy. For some reason, people still are scared off. Why?

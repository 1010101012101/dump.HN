When we download an OSS project I think we have the <i>expectation</i> of being able to integrate it into our own projects, and there's some amount of disappointment when it triggers a GPL conversion.<p>When Steve Jobs comes to the party, you don't say to him ""Look, you're not sharing your cake with us, so we're going to kick you out.""  You say ""Holy crap!  Steve Jobs!""  But when Joe-decent-coder-not-a-celebrity does the same thing, it leaves a different taste in your mouth.<p>I think another (similar) part of the equation is the hoity-toityness of the GPL and/or FSF.  Just read the GPL preample (WTF does a license have a preable for, anyway?).  The first time I read it, it sounded to me like Stallman and/or the FSF were called forth from the burning bush to save us from the horrible slavery of permissive licenses.  If you ask a random person off the street what sort of license an organization called the ""Free Software Foundation"" would use, I guarantee they wouldn't invent a whole Gettysburg address worth of rhetoric for why free software needs a handful of restrictions.<p>We can have a debate about whether copyleft is good or bad in the long run all day long.  I'm just saying, on a gut level, on a prejudicial level, if somebody presents you with a barely-half-page BSD/MIT license of ""Use this and don't sue us"", and then an epic novel about how you can have patents as long as they're nondiscriminatory, or granted prior to March 28, 2007, or that we'll put you on probation for 30 days (or maybe 60) if you violate something-or-other, and you must provide installation instructions with such-and-such, and you can't distribute such-and-such in a password protected RAR... On a gut reflex level, the second one hardly sounds like free software.  Maybe after researching it, you come around to their point of view.  But most people don't research it, and some of the ones who do disagree.",1247680799

Of course both numbers are presumably more than the ""target"" you are talking about, but I think it's safe to say that Great Britain is about 20% of the size of the USA.<p>Also, I don't understand the growth-rate math.

I like the British and lived there a long time but there's a bias against startups and small companies which makes it hard to get the ball rolling. Also, it's true that the grant culture is heavily embedded - partly because of the social system, but also because the cost of living in the UK is relatively high.

It's a great thing if this means that India and China are producing highly educated, productive people in large numbers.  It's a bad thing if India and China haven't improved, and the US is just slipping badly.<p>That said, we really have to stop holding India and China as a model for education.  Yes, they've had some tremendous success, but they absolutely <i>do not</i> produce hundreds of thousands of ultra talented scientists and engineers.  Most ""stem workers"" produced from this system are unemployable as by the standards we have in the US (to be fair, so are many college grads in the US - we just don't record them as ""engineers"" in our numbers).  IIT is a remarkable institution, but it is <i>tiny</i>.

That seems like it would require you to tell the software movies that you liked. The problem is: Who wants to do this on a site that doesn't let you do anything else with movies? People are more than happy to tell Amazon what movies they like (by buying them) or Netflix (by renting them), but why would they take the time to tell your application what movies they like just so they can get recommendations which they could have gotten at Netflix, which they are going to use to go to Netflix and rent anyway.<p>Email lookups?

I don't think I've seen this addressed in license FAQs.<p>For a specific example, there is a book called _Calendrical Calculations_ which collects algorithms (and source, in Common Lisp, IIRC) for doing numerous time/date-related conversions.

This seems a bit odd to me - it's not like they <i>designed</i> the Mayan calendar; while I respect that they did quite a bit of thorough research, that seems like the epitome of prior art. OTOH, the algorithms are also released under the GPL, in the form of the Emacs calendar mode.<p>The book's license: (<a href=""http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/first-edition/calcode.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/first-edit...</a>)<p>I'm a bit confused about the ramifications here - must one just ignore all of his research if you want to release date arithmetic code under a non-GPL free license?

I'm interested in writing a date arithmetic library in Lua or C, since having such a library specifically inside Emacs is of limited use, and my background is in history.<p>In that specific case, the authors are probably willing to negotiate (and I may just be misunderstanding things) - I'm more interested in how that situation plays out <i>in general</i>.",1247679019

That makes my point both relevant and correct ""Microsoft bashing"" and you, on the other hand, are just misled by the very PR spin I'm calling attention to.<p>Can you show me a link to this ""ruling""? No you can't. Why not? Because it's not happened yet. And when it does happen, the EU has been pushing for the installation of multiple browsers with a choice at startup.<p>Removing their own browser from the Euro version was an attempt by Microsoft to head off that ruling. Obviously they felt that either a) people would be more likely to install Internet Explorer this way, and/or b) that the negative reaction could be skilfully deflected onto the EU.<p>Sadly, part b) appears to be working judging by our posts relative scoring at least, again I can only hope they're wrong about a) and this leads to a further increase in market share for non-Microsoft browsers in Europe.",1247678355

If you contribute to a BSD'ed project you take the risk of your competitor taking your code and making it a competitive advantage against you.<p>We may say GPL'ed software is ""imprisonment resistant"".<p>As for taking in Lamson code into Django, all that's needed is a GPL'ed fork of Django that can follow trunk very closely.

But Bob can incorporate Alice's code without making any changes to his license terms, while Alice would have to change her license terms in order to incorporate Bob's code.<p>Thus, to Bob, Alice's code is ""free"" and ""open"". But to Alice, Bob's code isn't -- from her point of view she can only use Bob's code if she accepts restrictions on modification and distribution.<p>And so Alice -- regardless of whether it's <i>objectively</i> right to do so -- probably ends up feeling that Bob's putting one over on her when he says his code is ""free"".<p>In other words, it's not about someone saying ""I chose this permissive license and now I'm upset that other people abused my code"", it's about someone saying ""that other dude claims his software is 'free' but it doesn't look that way from where I'm standing"".",1247678109

Also, many small-to-medium size companies we talk to don't like Amazon (too expensive) but have a a few ten servers they wish to use as a distributed system (eg. database). We're attacking the distributed system market bottom-up, using open-source software to gain a foothold. Keyspace was originally planned to be a controler/meta-server, a low-level building block for other distributed systems, similar to how Google uses its Chubby server for GFS and BigTable --- Keyspace, like Google's Chubby, has an implementation of Lamport's Paxos consensus algorithm at its heart.

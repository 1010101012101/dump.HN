They may change their business, at some point, but right now, they have created a new broadcast medium, and they're doing what all media people try to do.  Get as many viewers as possible.  That's why they've had so much interest from other media companies and celebrities. CNN and Ashton Kutcher don't really understand software as a service.  You're in a software as a service business.<p>Being technologists, I think that we understand the software and technologies quite well, but I think that it's easy for us to confuse the completely separate businesses that are being built using those technologies.<p>100 years ago the blacksmiths like my grandfather became car mechanics.  The technologies both involved metal and fire, so the people that understood metal and fire became the people that fixed the horseless carriage.  There really wasn't a mental divide for people involved in those businesses because the technologies were so similar.<p>In another 20 years, I think the distinction between software as media and software as a product ans software as a service is going to become a lot clearer.  Until then, we're going to have a lot of confusion about this.",1254124776

Our current computing machines work solely on mutating chunks of memory.  This makes every program one big side effect.<p>But just because computers work that way doesn't mean that the application programmer needs to view them that way.  The application programmer can imagine that the computer as an evaluator of pure functions, and program accordingly.  The runtime will turn this idealized view of computation into something our current computers can run.<p>But that's the runtime's job, not yours.  As far as you're concerned, there is no such thing as side effects.  That is what everyone is referring to when they mention pure functional programming.",1254124214

848011,comment,847627,847627,0,0,btilly,,,"From the answers to the questions I am inclined to believe in the ""made it all up"" theory.  But at a 99% confidence level I can reject the possibility that it was made up with a simple simulation of the type described.<p>How am I so sure?  Well we're given all of the probabilities for all of the answers.  We can therefore calculate what (assuming independence) the likely odds are of different numbers of correct answers.  We're also given the number of students who got each number correct.  Here is the result (I'll give the program that I used at the end):<p><pre><code>  0 right: 46 vs 32.56
  1 right: 158 vs 147.61
  2 right: 246 vs 273.73
  3 right: 265 vs 278.71
  4 right: 177 vs 174.46
  5 right: 80 vs 70.58
  6 right: 22 vs 18.74
  7 right: 6 vs 3.23
  8 right: 0 vs 0.35
  9 right: 0 vs 0.02
  10 right: 0 vs 0.00
</code></pre>
The argument is that we should be suspicious because those two sets of numbers are too similar.  The tails are not heavy enough.  Now I admit that graphically it does look close.  But if you look, the tails _are_ heavy.  Is that difference significant?<p>We can use a confidence testing to answer that.  The null hypothesis is that the distribution comes from a simple simulation and should be close to the theoretical numbers that I just gave.  The alternate hypothesis is that the tails should be heavier and the middle lower.<p>Let's look at the middle because it is easier to calculate.  Theoretically 0.55244 of the test population should get one of those two numbers correct.  It is claimed that 511/1000 did.  How likely is that?<p>Well in the null hypothesis each student is an independent observation.  Each observation is a 1 or 0 with average 0.55244.  The variance of an observation is readily calculated and turns out to be 0.2472500464.<p>The number of people getting one of those two answers after 1000 observations is therefore approximately normal with average 552.44 and variance 1000 * 0.2472500464 = 247.2500464.  The standard deviation is the square root of that, which is 15.724.  That puts the observed value more than 2.63 standard deviations out.   at a 99% confidence we can conclude that the numbers were NOT generated by a simple simulation of the type described.<p>For the curious, here is how I calculated the theoretical distribution of answers:<p><pre><code>  #! /usr/bin/perl -w
  use strict;
  use Math::Polynomial;

  my $ans = 1;

  # Number from the % of students who got each question right.
  for my $x (qw(.28 .26 .27 .1 .14 .61 .43 .11 .23 .29)) {
    $ans *= Math::Polynomial->new(1-$x, $x);
  }
  
  print ""$ans\n"";

Common knowledge of group beliefs is a necessary condition for groupthink.<p>>The one thing in this experiment that might (I intuit) help discourage groupthink related behaviors is hiding one's own score from oneself, because people will then be less emboldened when they're being idiots just for expressing popular opinions.<p>The thing we need to be afraid of is <i>public</i> praise or shame for writing a well-received or poorly-received comment.<p>>Unfortunately, this will also (I intuit) discourage people when they're being smart from as readily taking another look at whether what they've said is idiotic when others recognize the idiocy.<p>I disagree.

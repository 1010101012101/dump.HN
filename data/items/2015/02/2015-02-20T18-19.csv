She insisted that her math was correct, and pretty much the whole class got the answer incorrect. Despite us telling her why she was wrong, she refused to listen.<p>I took the problem to a technology teacher I had, who was known for being a extremely intelligent-abrasive-and-fair (was a nuclear engineer before changing career paths and genuinely enjoyed teaching). Explained the situation and gave him the problem to independently solve. He said he didn&#x27;t want to overstep his bounds with the physics teacher, but the next day our scores had curiously changed to reflect the correct math.<p>Some people have too much pride to admit fault, especially to those they view as inferior.",1424458774

Its agility and responsiveness can be partly attributed to its rigid rotor blade design, a feature uncommon on competing helicopters.<p>The rotor system is entirely hingeless, the rotor head consisting of a solid titanium block to which the four blades are bolted; the flexibility of the rotor blades works to absorb movements typically necessitating hinges in most helicopter rotor designs. The reliability of the advanced rotor system is that, in over six million operating hours across the fleet, there had been a total of zero failures. One benefit of the Bo 105&#x27;s handling and control style is superior takeoff performance, including significant resistance to catastrophic dynamic rollover; a combination of weight and the twin-engined configuration enables a rapid ascent in a performance takeoff.<p>The MBB Bo 105 is the only heli cleared for acrobatic stunt flight and is the work horse of &quot;Flying Bulls&quot; (Red Bull).<p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBB_Bo_105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBB_Bo_105</a>",1424458528

I&#x27;m sure the idea is that &quot;I might be fired, better not get that job&quot; is easy to imagine, as is people running away from the industry at high speed if they could be fired.  Somehow most other professionals deal with the ability to be fired just fine.<p>But there are other forces at work that make less job lock good for workers.<p>First is coworkers. Education is a team activity, where your coworkers screw-up means more work for you.  I&#x27;ve worked at places where management refused to fire people who needed fired, because of friendships or pain aversion.  It was not fun fixing all their problems.  Fortunately I quit and watched them circle the drain.<p>The biggest is the ease of entry and exit.  If the only job available is one of a selected number where you have to wait for the current person holding it to retire, you have a situation like postdocs trying to get tenure track positions in American academia.  On the other hand, if there is a flow of teachers moving around in job market -- including people new to teaching, and people stopping teaching to do something else -- there&#x27;s plenty of room to find openings.

As you can guess, calculating this &quot;layout&quot; will occur pretty often, and if you have only one thread running all your code, then your logic and communication with the server can interfere with the rendering of the UI - thus making the response choppy.<p>On native apps, though some of them have borrowed web-type expressions of placement or layout, the entire calculation runs on a dedicated thread.

I had a funny thing happen to me in college that ruined my one chance at a 4.0 semester. I had just begun my physics major but had some electives to take as well.<p>I was taking the introductory microeconomics course. At the end of the semester I had received a B and I was relatively certain that I had achieved better, so I went to the professor&#x27;s office and asked to see how my grade had been calculated. As he started showing me the scores, I realized that none of them had been mine! In the end he had mixed my scores with another student who had the same last name (a very common name, in the professor&#x27;s defense). I was very happy at that point because I was really thinking I would receive an A! Sadly, the professor shook his head and said that I would still only get a B.<p>I was a bit shocked so I asked what the final calculation had given and he said a 0.8994. There were not 10,000 points possible and final grades had to be a two-digit representation of the semester&#x27;s work, so I was unsure why this kept me from an A. I explained to him that the last digit was not significant since there was no &quot;point&quot; to represent the digit, basically trying to explain significant figures to him. I then stated that since the grade had to be either an 89% or a 90%, surely it was more appropriate to receive a 90%.<p>He shook his head again and said to me what was probably one of the most infuriating and condescending things I&#x27;d ever heard from a moron with PhD. He said that economics as a field was likely much more difficult than my primary coursework and that I should not take it too hard that his course was my lowest grade that semester. Now I do not really buy into the perceived/nearly mythical reputation of difficulty that physics has gained, but I do know that we at least put our dependent variable on the appropriate axis. I am not an exceptionally gifted student, so I never did have another chance to receive a 4.0 semester in my math and physics coursework. I have always held a grudge against that professor.<p>EDIT: I realize I forgot to mention the part that was really infuriating, as I see that it is really not that frustrating as told. The thing that angered me the most, and the reason I went on about significant figures, is that the professor himself was not against rounding! He said that had I received an 0.8995 I would get the A! His entire grading framework was hinged on a poor understanding of math.",1424457899

Google hopes to unveil the new service at its developer conference in late May, said people familiar with the matter.<p>Google, however, exerts less control over the smartphones that use its Android mobile operating system than Apple Inc. does over its iPhones. Smartphone makers and wireless operators offer many flavors of Android devices, with different preloaded apps. Each player has its own priorities, and changes made on behalf of one player can inconvenience the rest.<p>Further complicating Google’s task is that some of its “partners” have plans for their own payment services. Samsung Electronics Co. , the biggest maker of Android phones by number of units, plans to unveil its own payment service next month using technology from LoopPay Inc., a payments startup Samsung acquired this week. A person familiar with the Samsung-LoopPay deal said big smartphone makers envision few benefits from cooperating with Google Wallet.<p>By contrast, Apple controls the iPhone’s hardware and software, giving it a big advantage. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said last week that Apple Pay was only possible because of this control. “Imagine trying to do this with several different companies,” Mr. Cook told an investment conference. “You’d be pulling your hair out.”<p>Persuading Android partners and financial-service companies to support its payment service requires Google to “herd the many cats involved,” wrote Tim Sloane, a payments analyst at Mercator Advisory Group, in a January research report. “It’s a mess,” he added in an interview.<p>Still, Google has to aim for success, because Apple Pay could become a draw for people to buy iPhones, instead of Android phones. Mr. Cook said last month that Apple Pay accounted for $2 of every $3 spent using contact-less payments on the largest payment networks.<p>Apple Pay “has changed the dynamics” of mobile payments, said Marc Freed-Finnegan, a former Google Wallet executive who is chief executive of retail-technology startup Index Inc. “If payments become a standard feature of phones, Google has to have a service on a par with Apple or better.”<p>A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Omid Kordestani, Google’s chief business officer, told investors last month that Google is working on a “fully functional payment system” that goes “beyond just tap and pay.”<p>Google launched Wallet in 2011, allowing owners of some Android phones to pay by tapping on retail checkout terminals equipped with a wireless technology known as near-field communication. But most large U.S. carriers refused to preload the Wallet app on their Android phones. They also blocked the service from accessing a chip that stored credit-card information, because they were working on their own payment service.<p>In 2010, AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. formed Isis, later renaming it Softcard. The service failed to gain much traction, and Google is now in exclusive talks to acquire it as a key component of the revived Google Wallet, people familiar with the matter have said.<p>The three wireless carriers are more willing to work with Google these days, because they get no revenue from Apple Pay, the people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Freed-Finnegan said that’s created an incentive for Google and the carriers to cooperate. “Certainly Apple isn’t working with the carriers,” he said.<p>The three carriers and Softcard declined to comment.<p>In talks with the carriers, Google is offering to pay them to feature Wallet prominently on their Android phones and is dangling the promise of more revenue from advertising tied to Google searches made on the phones, according to the people familiar with the matter.<p>For Google, one big benefit of having a popular Wallet app would be the data it could collect on consumer purchases, which would give the company something besides website clicks to demonstrate the effectiveness of its ads. That could drive up ad prices, and carriers would share in the gains.<p>Banks are playing their own waiting game, to see how many carriers and device makers cooperate. Hundreds of banks are participating in Apple Pay, but most are interested in reaching Android users too. Android smartphones accounted for 47.6% of U.S. smartphone sales in December, a fraction less than Apple devices, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.<p>Banks pay Apple a small fee for each transaction because Apple’s security measures reduce their fraud-prevention costs. Apple Pay users’ credit-card information is encrypted and stored on the phone, so merchants never see it.<p>Google is talking to banks and payment networks, including Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., hoping for a similar deal, according to people familiar with the situation.<p>Google’s situation is more complicated. In 2013, it eliminated a requirement that payment information for Wallet be stored in hardware, because the carriers had prevented Wallet from accessing the data that way. Its alternative, a software-based approach known as Host Card Emulation, may require banks to upgrade their antifraud systems. Mr. Sloane, the Mercator analyst, said the associated costs and disruption may make banks less willing to share fees with Google.<p>—Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed to this article.<p>Write to Alistair Barr at alistair.barr@wsj.com",1424457812

Send the buffer to your gpu, have it execute the command, send it to your screen which probably has a CPU of its own. Pushing a pixel is hard, and you have to do it 60 times a second. That&#x27;s also why you don&#x27;t just push a pixel but the entire screen at once.
How hard it is for you depends entirely on the API. While Direct3D/OpenGL expose all the details, others like XNA or even Javascript&#x27;s canvas do it rather painlessly.<p>What&#x27;s really hard isn&#x27;t pushing a pixel to the screen: it&#x27;s doing it fast enough (i.e. same as your screen&#x27;s refresh rate ideally) so that the user doesn&#x27;t notice a visible delay. When 75% of the API is blocking AND you do work on the UI thread (Which is absolutely insane that browser developers haven&#x27;t picked up this practice considering it&#x27;s been advocated for more than 15 years on the native side of things), it&#x27;s usually going to be visible.",1424457644

There is enormous benefit in figuring out a solution, and flexing those mental muscles is really important, but I think that it&#x27;s also very reasonable to talk with a mentor or co-worker about a problem and be given some tools (mental, software, or otherwise) to help work through a solution.  I think that good mentors and senior developers default to this approach even when they are asked for solutions, at least those who are invested in growing the capabilities of their teams.<p>Looking at my personal experience, I&#x27;m one of the two senior developers on our 10-person team, and I&#x27;m typically the person that our junior and mid-level developers approach with any questions they might have.  We have two developers on our team who started about a year apart, both of them have networking backgrounds and had no personal or professional development experience before joining our team.  Our newest developer who is very motivated to grow and learn and wants to figure everything out for himself- give him a problem and he&#x27;ll run off and you won&#x27;t hear from him again until he has a solution and a war story about the three other approaches he tried before he arrived at this best of all solutions.  The other developer did and still does ask for a lot of help, but the question is always &quot;how do I learn about this&quot;.<p>The first developer is still awful. He constantly falls victim to the problem of unknown-unknowns, and while his solutions are frequently clever they often are completely obviated by a small bit of knowledge about computer science, or of a common tool, or of a common development practice.  Eventually when you see what he&#x27;s come up with you can point out how something that already exists could have solved the problem, and there&#x27;s even a bit of benefit to his understanding why things may be done in a certain way, having run into some of the problems they solve himself during his implementation- but the overall rate of progress is incredibly slow and as often as not after investing so much effort into his solution he fails to see why another approach would be better.  The second developer has grown into a very skilled developer remarkably quickly, and I think it&#x27;s because while they both have the tendency to shave yaks and crawl down rabbit holes in search of knowledge, the second developer has been willing to ask what the most profitable yaks to shave would be, how to best crawl down the deepest rabbit holes, and where to find the obscure bits of knowledge that you might not run into without the arcane search phrase incantations that seem to only come about with a lot of experience and a bit of luck.",1424457560

Then a BabyJS will be introduced inside BabyHTML to manipulate an object model called BabyDOM for the canvas to make more maintainable code and optional animation. BabyJS will be so fast that everything that can be written in BabyJS will be written in BabyJS.

If that didn&#x27;t work, you might have a worthwhile question.  This also requires you to be open to other people asking for help, and my greatest worry about this rule of thumb is that it makes people disinclined to help _each_ _other_.

I was annoyed that each time I asked for help - the type of help I often provided myself - that inevitably whomever was paying attention to the list at that time of day would jump all over me and treat me like a n00b.  I didn&#x27;t want to come out restating my entire experience with a project before answering a question, but these flamewars aside, I found that often people would help anyway, but that sometimes the answers made me feel dumb.<p>This came down to asking well-informed questions.

If you respect your teammates, you can just kind of spitball a little about, &quot;Hum this is really frustrating, are you kidding, Feature X in Package Y is implemented with a Dorner-Lannister sort? The Fuck?  How stupid is..&quot; And an intrepid teammate may say something like:<p>--
&quot;Yeah.  I mean.  I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the decision I would have made, but I spent a good two days fighting with this exact problem a couple of months back, let me find you a mailing list thread.

You&#x27;re also right about me bringing in baggage from other languages. Those are valid points, yet I would still like to see CL become more appealing to programmers from other languages, whose baggage becomes relevant to their intuitions.<p>> <i>Those are higher-order functions for operating on linked list and are in the Common Lisp specification anyway.</i><p>This Common Lisp reference [1] equates &quot;cdr&quot; with &quot;rest&quot;. I am not familiar with the source, so is this a good reference? If so, then I must still argue that &quot;rest&quot; returning the cdr of a list instead of all the elements except the first is not intuitive to me. Or maybe I am misunderstanding something. My familiarity is with Clojure, not Common Lisp, so that might be interfering with my ability to understand what you mean here.<p>> <i>Suggesting that Common Lisp should remove them is like saying you should remove pointers from C.</i><p>That is an interesting point.

As the natural biodiversity in both soils and seeds decrease, the risk of catastrophic pest swapping large number of crops grows and over-reliance on chemicals becomes a given.<p>We certainly need modern agriculture as a transitional technology to keep feeding the 7+ billion people on Earth today, but if this does not come hand in hand with measures to drastically reduce fertility rates (and per capita consumption, but that&#x27;s another story) it means little more than kicking the can down the road. After all, the most important reason we are facing this dilemma today is that our parents&#x27; generation faced the same challenge when we were 4+ billion and decided to pretend there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.<p>Your choice of labeling alternative agro proponents as &quot;radicals&quot; because they cannot avoid calling a spade a spade tells more about the willful ignorance of society on these matters than about any objective measure of character of the label&#x27;s subjects.

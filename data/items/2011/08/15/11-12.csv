(NYSE: MMI) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Google will acquire Motorola Mobility for $40.00 per share in cash, or a total of about $12.5 billion, a premium of 63% to the closing price of Motorola Mobility shares on Friday, August 12, 2011. The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.\nThe acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a dedicated Android partner, will enable Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing. Motorola Mobility will remain a licensee of Android and Android will remain open. Google will run Motorola Mobility as a separate business.\nLarry Page, CEO of Google, said, Motorola Mobilitys total commitment to Android has created a natural fit for our two companies. Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers. I look forward to welcoming Motorolans to our family of Googlers.\nSanjay Jha, CEO of Motorola Mobility, said, This transaction offers significant value for Motorola Mobilitys stockholders and provides compelling new opportunities for our employees, customers, and partners around the world. We have shared a productive partnership with Google to advance the Android platform, and now through this combination we will be able to do even more to innovate and deliver outstanding mobility solutions across our mobile devices and home businesses.\nAndy Rubin, Senior Vice President of Mobile at Google, said, We expect that this combination will enable us to break new ground for the Android ecosystem. However, our vision for Android is unchanged and Google remains firmly committed to Android as an open platform and a vibrant open source community. We will continue to work with all of our valued Android partners to develop and distribute innovative Android-powered devices.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals in the US, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and the approval of Motorola Mobilitys stockholders. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2011 or early 2012.",1313408433

Well, I don't want people to take my money away through taxes either. No one does. Its not about want, or even opinion, its about fairness.

Is it something objective about the thing to be done, or does it have to do with your mental framing of the task at hand? I feel it is the latter. A friend of mine reviews video games professionally, and he procrastinates on playing games. I think it's because he is told to play games.

That's too removed and abstract a concept for them (ironic, given that it affects them directly). Instead, they're voting emotionally: on social values, and on the politics of identity and nationalism. These abstract concepts are very ""real"" to a lot of Americans, because they're the things people cling to and hold fast when everything else is taken from them.<p>Bear in mind that a lot of these people have seen social values <i>work</i> for them amidst their own circumstances. Those among them who work their asses off, keep out of trouble, go to church, stay clean, and don't overspend will do markedly better than their peers who slack off, abuse government assistance, and engage in reckless behavior. Meanwhile, a preponderance of military personnel are drawn from the families of the working poor -- so these folks eat, breathe, and sleep patriotism. They love America, even if the version of ""America"" they love is largely a myth.<p>Republicans have become masters of speaking the language of identity politics and values. They understand what tune these guys want to dance to, and they play it flawlessly. Meanwhile, Democrats are tonedeaf. Nevermind that Democrats may actually have the interests of the little guy in mind; they don't speak the little guy's language. And that makes all the difference.<p>Case in point: the Democrats consistently talk about ""the middle class,"" and sometimes ""the working class"" or ""the poor."" Meanwhile, Republicans always talk about ""Americans."" They rarely even <i>speak</i> of classes or social divides. It's a brilliant rhetorical gesture, because it recognizes that the working classes don't enjoy hearing about how shitty their lives are. They don't like the labels. If you ask them, many of them won't even agree that they're ""working class"" or ""poor."" They're in denial, and it's a defiant denial. They're too proud to face reality, and when Dems constantly throw the reality of their misery in their faces, they get angry and resentful.",1313406014

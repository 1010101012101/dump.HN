While I understand social media is a powerful form of promotion, its not the be all end all, there is more too it, especially when you do something outside of social media that you are promoting. The part about going for the little applause was great, you get hooked on each tweet, each video, each blog post and its performance in regards to audience reaction, instead of the entire body of work you've created. It has the ability to chop your ""art"" into micro bits, because it has got to fit inside the constraints of social media. In a way you become your product, it sounds like he stopped being a musician and was selling John Mayer on Twitter, it wasn't about the music anymore.<p>Which is kind of hard to stop doing, because its what the majority of the internet audience wants. Jeri Ellsworth made an interesting statement about the electronics/hacks she creates, the audience likes the simple ones, and don't care much about the much more technical and in depth videos she creates. The audience to some effect seems to be only interested in the short and simple. Which I would imagine, if John Mayer spent all his social media time, talking about music, and music theory, and the kind of things you would think someone would want to know from a talented artist, I doubt he'd have the followers. Where as, if he sticks to the one liners, and small talk, its vastly more popular.<p>As for the mental changes is causes, I fully understand this. I've read a bit about how the human brain changes according to how it is use. And also, when I was still blogging, I noticed an interesting change in myself. I started consuming the world in a ""how can I blog this"" sort of way. Anything even remotely interesting that happened, instead of me enjoying the life experience, quickly turned to, how can I phrase this on my blog? The short time I was on Twitter, I found I spent more mental capacity, sorting through my thoughts to Twitterize them, than on the actual thoughts. If you're famous for social media, that is great. If your a musician, author, electrical engineer, etc, it has the side effect of changing how you think, and then how you create, if you focus on it too much.",1312487995

For example, I don't think it's too farfetched to think that they may inventory the contents of the SEALs' pockets before departing on a mission.<p>The author of this piece also seems to imply that there is no good reason for the journalist not to reveal his sources, which is of course totally wrong, especially for something like this.<p>Lastly, the author totally ignores the fact that she is accusing of complicity a magazine known for the quality of its fact-checking. I would think it's safe to say the author's deception would have either have had to be astonishingly good or the new yorker to be particularly malicious for the accusations here to be true. One of those may be the case, but she should explicitly say that she is questioning the ability of the New Yorker's fact-checking team.<p>I guess at the end of the day, it's still worthy of questioning and investigating, but to me this article comes off as the argument of someone with an ax to grind more than an investigation.",1312487174

Most CLIs have this at an extremely basic level -- invoke the command with invalid arguments and it will print out a short ""help"" blurb.<p>Some tools (e.g. git, sbt) take it a step further and will suggest alternatives based on similar commands. 'git sattus' will ask if you mean 'git status', for example.<p>WolframAlpha has a particularly interesting interface where you basically type natural language and it tries to parse it into a formal language. It then shows you the formal input interpretation (in addition to the output). This lets you immediately see if the program interpreted your command correctly, because a person can understand the formal specification of the command very easily. If you, the person, detect a misunderstanding it is then very simple to update your input so it's parsed correctly the next time.<p>For example, look at these queries. Note the formal input interpretation of the first, and the ""closest interpretation"" of the second:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=is+10+percent+of+the+population+of+united+states+%3E+25+million%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=is+10+percent+of+the+po...</a><p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=combinations+of+1%2C+2%2C+3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=combinations+of+1%2C+2%...</a>",1312486757

2847347,comment,2845368,2845554,4,0,ellyagg,,,"It's funny that your parent is downvoted below zero when he's absolutely right. I don't use IRC very much, but the last time I did, I wanted to use the name I'd registered with previously. Unfortunately, Pidgin kept telling me my name was already in use or some crap. It was quite difficult at the time, not being an initiate in the appropriate vocabulary, to figure out the search terms to use to discover that I needed to ""ghost"" the user or some ridiculous unintuitive incantation. I may have got the details wrong, but that only confirms my point. IRC is too hard for non-techies. I'm a programmer by profession, and if it gives me the slightest hassle, it's too hard for other people.<p>Maybe a nice client could make this pain go away, but I doubt it. All the ones I've tried have suffered from the same learning curve problem and the same in-grained assumptions that come from regular use of IRC. Even if one were easy and elegant, I'm not sure that could overcome the negative network effects of so many clients, billed as IRC, doing it badly. I'm not going to analyze it in detail right now, but there's myriad subtracting reinforcements from a community that mostly uses user-unfriendly clients and protocols. You can't just make one good client and get a tipping point. In fact, desktop linux <i>does</i> look like a good analogy here.<p>Moreover, it would be disingenuous to claim that IRC being techie-unfriendly is ""outdated"" when the majority of clients and tech how-tos pointing to clients are the same as they ever were. I would guess that the majority of IRC use is still done on unfriendly clients, e.g., Pidgin. One or two low share clients existing don't speak for IRC.<p>Now, I'm not saying XMPP or this client is an answer. But, yes, IRC is and always will be unpopular with the non-tech population.",1312485519

2847301,comment,2844059,2845844,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"Correct. Only in relatively recent times has the distinction ""class"" become solely delineated by income or wealth.<p>Wealth has always been a big part of it, but throughout much of human history, wealth didn't create class; class created wealth. Your access to the monarch or ruling body granted you certain monopolistic privileges and land, from which you derived enormous wealth. But the wealth was the byproduct of, and not the generator of, class. (In fact, many extremely wealthy people, such as successful merchants and traders, were nevertheless denied elite class status because their class ranking had been fixed at birth).<p>This equation was turned on its head to some extent by the industrial revolution. This was the first time in history when the wealth generated by industry and trade began to dwarf the wealth generated by land ownership and agriculture on a massive and undeniable scale -- thereby wrenching power from the nobles/landowners, and placing it in the hands of newly minted industrialists. But even in the following century, it took a long while for wealth and social class to become thoroughly decoupled, and then reassembled in a different way.<p>What's happening now in America is that we're once again returning to a system where parentage and class beget wealth, which fixes class, which then repeats with the next generation. There are always notable exceptions to the rule, and these exceptions are held up in support of the ""American Dream."" But they are very clearly the exceptions. (And, in a surprising many of those rags-to-riches stories, a closer examination of the events behind the narrative often reveals that the ""rags"" origins were exaggerrated to varying degrees).",1312485005

The godfathers of this movement started their companies in late 90s in either mobile or gaming sectors and are now acting as angels and mentors or serial entrepreneurs. It's clear that Nokia's success did help mobile startups a lot. Success of gaming companies was independent of Nokia and was due to Finnish demo scene, but also for mobile gaming companies, Nokia's presence was an obvious benefit.<p>However, the raise of the new startup movement in Finland started earlier than Nokia's problems became obvious. I think it's part of the same global startup movement that e.g. Y-combinator has been creating. As it's mostly cultural phenomenon, role models and blogs like Arctic Startup has played very important role. I was part of Jaiku that was acquired by Google, and although it was just a talent acquisition, many people have said afterwards that it really inspired them to become more interested in startups.",1312484497

If the Stones had spent as much time obsessing over choreography of their Youtube videos in their early days as they did just playing gigs, would they have ended up as the Stones? Will we ever see a pop band again with a repertoire that deep?<p>Then again I guess the Richards himself had time to nurse a heroine addiction and do some other extraneous stuff at the height of his creative powers.

905155,comment,902678,903258,0,0,StrawberryFrog,,,"Notepad is really simple from a programmer's point of view. It's a window, with an edit box and a menu on it. Ok, so the added complexity is that there's a second window for the find/replace dialog. I suspect that the command-line edit has more lines of code in it, because less is given in the libraries.",1256637298

I remember the early 2000s when ActiveX seemed like one of few options to deliver functionality that wasn't thought possible with just HTML and Javascript - and it was even reasonable to go ahead and use it because everyone was on IE6 anyway.<p>Dark days.<p>Edit: Oh, it's actually law!

How is this not working?<p>I can just imagine doing the same in the USA.  Not.<p>Not so long ago when my wife (British) and I (Australian) went to Melbourne she was invited to give a lecture related to her work.  The advice we were given was - accept no money at all, even for expenses.<p>If he didn't bother to check on these things then I have very little sympathy.  The other countries almost certainly have similar conditions, and mostly things are fine if you check in advance.",1256637179

For instance for a quadruple extra large instance (68GB) it would cost about $27k a year.

905131,comment,903748,904179,0,0,gonzo,,,"I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV.   So was my father.  His father started a water well drilling business in 1953, my father joined him in that business (post collage) in 1957.<p>In 1980, my father decided to build a house.  We (meaning <i>I</i>) was sent to the property in order to drill two 800 foot deep 'wells', which were subsequently cased with 8"" (ID) steel pipe, but not perforated.  (There was a 1/2"" plate on the bottom of the casing.)<p>After this, we filled the casing with water.  (A fine test of one's skill at welding.)  Then added a 2"" galvanized ""loop"" inside the casing, which was then hooked in to a heat pump.<p>It was the single-most efficient ""single family residence"" HVAC system in the state.<p>We subsequently added hot-water recapture to the indoor AC units, in order to make the most of the heat ""pulled"" out of the house.<p>Dad also built the house with R-44 insulation in the walls, R-60 or so in the attic, and a white 'Spanish tile' roof.<p>The result, a power bill of around $100/mo for a 5000 sq ft home in the desert that was numbingly cold in the summer, and pleasantly warm in the winter.  (It does get cold in LV.)<p>It helped that 40% of the square footage was basement (something else nobody in Las Vegas has, because it turns <i>hard</i> about 4 feet down.)",1256635541

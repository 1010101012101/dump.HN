But what if we lumped all social networks together, and looked at aggregate usage over time? It would constantly increase. I think that instead of dying out, it will plateau until we reach saturation. Other communication technologies follow this model: radio, television, telephones, cell phones, etc.<p>Rather than being a novelty, I think that the past decade has demonstrated that online social networks are something most people want and will continue to use.<p>To be clear, you and I are making contradicting factual predictions about the future.

7105970,comment,7101227,7102158,2,0,chongli,,,"Pointfree style is a tricky style to get right. There is a bot on the #haskell IRC channel (lambdabot) that has a function which will transform any valid Haskell function definition into pointfree style. The results that come out of this are often totally ridiculous! Here&#x27;s an example (stolen from the IRC channel, @pl is the bot command to do the transformation):<p><pre><code>    @pl transform k z = reverse (foldr (\\x y -> y ++ [fst(head(filter (\\a -> snd a == k-1) (zip x [0..])))]) [] z)\n</code></pre>\nTransformed into:<p><pre><code>    transform = (reverse .) . flip foldr [] . (flip (++) .) . flip flip [] . (((:) . fst . head) .) . (. flip zip [0..]) . filter . (. snd) . (==) . subtract 1\n</code></pre>\nYeah, neither is readable. This function ought to be broken up into cleaner, more declarative parts. In fact, the whole function can be reduced to this:<p><pre><code>    transform k = map (!! k)\n</code></pre>\nMuch more readable, wouldn&#x27;t you agree? Now all you need to know is what <i>map</i> and <i>!!</i> do.",1390431393

In the US-- not just in third world countries. They make no profit. They win the prize of being beaten, but not to death. Then, when what they&#x27;re doing is discovered, they go to jail. Instead of the kidnapper. Which they can&#x27;t fight because the person who has actually profited from what they&#x27;ve done would literally kill them and their entire family if they did.<p>That is why anyone is advocating that buying-- not selling-- sex be illegal. Because there are far more men benefiting from female prostitution than females benefiting from it. And the organizations that try to rescue women are made helpless by current legislation.<p>The solution presented is imperfect, of course, because 100% of women do not fall into this category. It&#x27;s just that the women in this situation have no way of identifying as such without someone going after the people they love.<p>On the other hand, you have men who are down in the dumps, who seek a prostitute to feel better. There may be legitimate mental health issues there, which is deeply unfortunate.<p>We could make their side &quot;legal&quot; as well. But would that make the situation better or worse? It seems to me that jailing a man who purchases sex is the least of two &quot;evils.&quot; Which is the best any legislation can do, really.<p>If you want someone to be mad at, please, be mad at the pimps.

[Pauses to finish reading article.]<p>&quot;John Cannarella and Joshua Spechler, from the US university&#x27;s mechanical and aerospace engineering department, have based their prediction on the number of times Facebook is typed into Google as a search term.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a convenient methodology, but of course it&#x27;s a methodology that cannot be applied to anything before the availability of Google search data, so it doesn&#x27;t even provide a model for explaining why Google supplanted AltaVista. (Hint: even at its healthiest, I don&#x27;t think most users of AltaVista found AltaVista by doing a Google search first.)<p>&quot;They tested various equations against the lifespan of Myspace, before applying them to Facebook.&quot;<p>Myspace, of course, is the classic example of a social networking site that once looked unstoppable, until it pretty much died. But data-fitting to just one data set is probably not enough model testing for making a prediction about a different social networking site.<p>&quot;But Facebook&#x27;s chief financial officer David Ebersman admitted on an earnings call with analysts that during the previous three months: &#x27;We did see a decrease in daily users, specifically among younger teens.&#x27;&quot;<p>Now we&#x27;re talking about some meaningful data that actually pertains directly to Facebook. If Facebook corporate officers are concerned about a trend, maybe that trend is really meaningful to Facebook&#x27;s business prospects.<p>&quot;Investors do not appear to be heading for the exit just yet. Facebook&#x27;s share price reached record highs this month, valuing founder Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s company at $142bn.&quot;<p>Well, that&#x27;s the nub of the issue for anyone who buys shares of Facebook stock. If it still looks like holding Facebook stock allows a profitable exit, maybe there is nothing to worry about here (at least for investors).<p>The article engages in further speculation about Facebook making a lot of money in the future. That could happen. My prediction about Facebook stands: &quot;Facebook will go the way of AOL, still being a factor in the industry years from now, but also serving as an example of a company that could never monetize up to the level of the hype surrounding it. I used to see friends on AOL. I never felt an obligation to help AOL monetize just because of that. Networks are a dime a dozen. Right now, Facebook is a very convenient network, and I like it. I do not predict that Facebook will make a lot of money because of users like me.&quot;<p>I could be proven wrong, but that&#x27;s what I think the future of Facebook holds. I admit my methodology is just about entirely drawing an analogy with AOL, which I used a lot back in the day.",1390429877

So naturally, I procrasinated and did everything but. It&#x27;s been on my radar for awhile. I was attracted to it by it&#x27;s documentation. Turns out, I really enjoyed it. It felt familiar because I&#x27;ve used Django for so long. I brought this up at the dinner table.<p>Jacob said something that took me by surprise. I can&#x27;t quote him exactly--the wine and drinks were too good that evening, but it was something to the effect of &quot;Flask is what Django should have been&quot;.

Django taught us a lot.<p>What I took from this was, both have their place and we have a lot to be thankful for, especially coming from the Django community.

Imagine a flat gradient across the screen from black to white. 255 levels over say 2000 pixels (close enough) on a screen like... 6 feet across. Unless the gradient is dithered (either in the TV, or at the source...), you get ~8 pixel wide bands, which works out to 1/4th inch bands, which is definitely visible in certain situations.<p>If you have a RGB image were each color component uses a byte to represent it, you should have a effective Luma bit depth of 8 bit. Well, this is false for LCD screens because they have a effective Luma bit depth of 7 or 6 bits (or worst), so even using a VGA signal (analog signal) you get banding on these screens, were on a old good CRT screen you never appreciate it.",1390428612

528444,comment,527671,527857,0,0,nileshk,,,"In OS X, I find that I am better off using the Emacs-style keyboard shortcuts that are available in most applications (CTRL-A/E/N/P/F/B and a few others).  Many of these shortcuts also work in the terminal when using bash.  For your example going to the end of the line is CTRL-E; it works in most apps and you didn't even have to move your hands away from the home row.  I use these when using bash on Linux, too.<p>I too am annoyed by those windows that require Esc to go away, like the font chooser, as I expect Cmd-W to work univerally for that.  I found some AppleScripts somewhere that can be used to move/resize windows with the keyboard, but haven't tried them out yet, but that's also something I wish OS X could do out of box.  Moving/resizing windows in OS X is really inefficient, and apps aren't very efficient about new window placement.<p>I use Cmd-Shift-{ and Cmd-Shift-} to switch tabs which appears to what's been standardized on, but just tried Cmd-Shift-arrows and it works in both Terminal and Safari (using Leopard) but not Firefox.<p>I find you have to memorize a lot more to be efficient with OS X's hot keys, due to the lack of mnemonics.",1237812488

Looking at the page a bit longer, it becomes easier to absorb. One of the reasons for that is that the top elements in the visual hierarchy are the bubble background shapes (and not the text in the bubbles). So at a first glance, my eyes just pick up four big bubble shapes. I think the site would work very differently if the bubble backgrounds were very light and the text in them wasn't as tightly set.<p>For me personally, this semi-clutter speaks against their products and the company's focus on simplicity.

5196717,comment,5195676,5195676,14,0,nlh,,,"I've been thinking about this a lot since I first read about it yesterday. Here's what I think is _fair_ (throwing out doctrine, etc.). IA(definitely)NAL.<p>Monsanto has every right to get a patent on the 1G seeds. They have every right to sell those seeds -- they put money and effort into designing a (theoretically) improved product and should be rewarded for their investment.<p>Once they sell the 1G seeds, however, that's it. If the resulting plants produce equal-quality 2G seeds, then so be it. Once the farmer has purchased the 1G seeds (presumably from Monsanto), that's the end of the road for Monsanto. They've produced a product, sold it, and made their money.<p>What's happening here is that Monsanto is using the courts to compensate for a bad business model and a flaw in their design. If they want to continue to get farmers to purchase seeds from them year after year, then what they <i>should</i> have done is engineered the seeds to ""expire"" after a generation:  The results plants should produce 2G seeds that are in some way inferior to the 1G seeds.<p>That way, farmers have a natural incentive to keep purchasing 1G seeds year after year. No lawsuits or restrictive license agreements needed. If farmers want the best, they buy from Monsanto. If they are ok with the inferior 2G seeds, then they can harvest their own and keep planting.<p>If it's not possible for Monsanto to engineer the seeds as such, well, too bad. The buck stops there. They need to charge more for the 1G seeds then. But farmers won't pay if the cost is too high?  Well, again, too bad. Their job is to convince farmers that buying 1G seeds at 2-3x the price is worth it because of the improved product. If not, well, back to the drawing board.<p>This comes down to Monsanto trying to use a license agreement and the courts to compensate for a flaw in their product design, and that isn't right.",1360511917

Light cigarettes are more common today, and most light cigarettes seem to get their lightness entirely from lengthier filters that have small holes in the paper. (If you use the tobacco for some other purpose, e.g., as filler for an unfiltered marijuana cigarette, then you'll find the smoke just as harsh and the roach paper no less tarry.) This requires a more forceful draw to avoid that unpleasant ""sucking in air"" sensation.<p>I've also noticed, on the occasions that I've checked recently, that cigarettes today tend to have lower advertised tar and nicotine content than the ones I smoked as a teenager.

No, it wasn't painted in Herbie colors  Volkswagen called its sport-tuned machine the Beetle GSR, ""Gelb Schwarzer Renner"" or ""Yellow Black Racer."" Hence, the somewhat shocking paint scheme.<p>VW is bringing its sporty black and yellow Beetle back for 2014, and you can see live photos of it above. It's got a 210-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine under the hood (that'd be the hood up front, unlike the car's forebear), and a six-speed manual or DSG automatic transmission sends those ponies to the front wheels. Note that this car's output is up 10 horses on other turbo VWs, and the Jetta GLI and Beetle Turbo for 2013. The 0-60 run takes 6.6 seconds, and top speed is limited to 130 miles per hour.<p>Besides the in-your-face black and yellow paint, the GSR is outfitted with a large rear spoiler and 19-inch wheels shod with 235/40 tires. The bee-like hue carries over inside, with yellow stitching on black leather. Only 3,500 will be produced, each with its own unique plaque. Pricing has not yet been announced, but you're free to read through the press release below all the same.",1360509620

I am glad that when I compare Micro with similar frameworks, I realize how small Micro is:) And I truly like it this way. Sure Micro is lacking the persistence support for now (many other features too, probably) and it will be hard to compare it with other frameworks from this perspective. However, Micro is modular and can be expanded easily! (I am searching for a light ORM that I could add as an optional extension; activejdbc, maybe?)<p>Honestly, I see all the other similar frameworks as options, not as competitors. Let the users compare and choose based on what they want to accomplish. Maybe they'll use ... I don't know ... Play, to randomly pick one, for building an awesome e-comm web site, but would they use it for developing a .. blog, or a fast REST service front-end layer let's say?!

I designed Micro's functionality from outside-in, and tweak it for performance from inside-out; small memory footprint, light and fast, .yml for config, extensions, routing and REST support without Java annotation, scripting support for fast prototyping, template engines for clean dynamic content manipulation. I am trying to bring in as much as I learned from my experience as a Sinatra/Merb developer.<p>Working with Designers for so many years, I was trying to build something that a Designer can use in minutes and use it for publishing his work with the littlest effort possible; all these without writing a single line of Java code. I am sure Play/SpringMVC can do that too?!<p>For Micro, the separation of roles and concerns is adamant.
Micro (like jpublish.org) is about helping the publishers taking their dynamic content to the web as easy as possible, while allowing the Developers to bring in as much business logic power as possible but without interfering with the content publishing concern; the true separation of roles and concerns. Please have a look at Micro's documentation web site: <a href=""http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca/</a> (source on Github too); hosted at Heroku, it is a Micro web app and its entire content is written in Markdown.

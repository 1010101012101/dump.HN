2793302,comment,2791778,2791888,2,0,chalst,,,"There are several different degrees of default, and ratings agencies take into account the severity of possible or past defaults in assigning credit ratings.  For instance, Standard & Poor's has the following distinction [1]:<p>> <i>An obligor rated 'SD' (selective default) or 'D' has failed to pay one or more of its financial obligations (rated or unrated) when it came due. A 'D' rating is assigned when Standard & Poor's believes that the default will be a general default and that the obligor will fail to pay all or substantially all of its obligations as they come due. An 'SD' rating is assigned when Standard & Poor's believes that the obligor has selectively defaulted on a specific issue or class of obligations, excluding those that qualify as regulatory capital, but it will continue to meet its payment obligations on other issues or classes of obligations in a timely manner. A selective default includes the completion of a distressed exchange offer, whereby one or more financial obligation is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par.</i><p>According to this definition, Greece is SD, and S&P has rated this credit event so.<p>Felix Salmon is very much a ""default is default, even if it means making a coupon payment one day late"" kind of person: he is not using weasel words here.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245303711350"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?asse...</a>",1311339579

The problem right now is that very few scientists can research things which actually interest them. Often, they are working for a company which is attempting to make more money, or the military, which is attempting to kill more people, or academia, where the idea is to get the most prestige. All of those things directly decrease the quality of research and have no place in science.<p>As a scientist, I could go onto this site, write up a hypothesis and outline the experiment that needs to be performed to test it. Then, people who have an interest in the particular piece of research could provide funding, loan equipment or even directly contribute by becoming part of the team. After the experiment has been completed, the results are released in the public domain (this also helps to break up the monopoly that scientific publication have). Crowd sourcing is then utilised to verify the findings and discuss their implications.<p>To put it another way, science should be something that everyone can do, given enough free time and determination, yet, as things are, only a select few get to do this and often have to deal with mountains of politics to get to that stage.",1311339514

2793295,comment,2792985,2792985,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"The first question: what power do you have to affect change? Are you senior management? Or ""protege"" of someone high up in the company? If not, your odds of bringing in sweeping cultural change are low. Very low.<p>Second question: how much reach do you need? Do you want to work in: (a) an environment where no one wears a suit, (b) an environment where no one has to wear a suit, (c) an environment where tech people don't have to wear suits, (d) an environment where suits aren't required but everyone seeking promotion still wears one? The more people who will have to change to suit your vision, the lower your chances of success.<p>Third: the problems with your work aren't abstract cultural issues. They're concrete. So focus on those, because some are very easy to fix and some are get-another-job-now intractible. What's the <i>real</i> problem? If you enjoy the work but hate the ""sterile, dreary"" office decorum, suck it up because that's a small issue. If the problem is bad management and you're a grunt, best to leave on your own terms because raising the issue could have you leaving not on your own terms. If the problem is bureaucracy, ask your manager if it's possible to hire another person to manage the bureaucracy so technology people can be more productive. Abstract cultural problems are vague and hard to specify, much less solve. Concrete problems have solutions (but the solution may be that you need to get another job.)",1311339476

This stuff is annoying to have to replicate yourself, and I'm glad to see MooTools support as well.<p>That said, my first reaction when looking at the first Country dropdown example was that I liked the native one better since in OS X it shows me dozens of choices at once (fills most of the screen vertically) and then in the ""after"" suddenly I was constrained to only seeing 7 countries at a time.

I would suggest laying out a careful plan beforehand.  Figure out what your base living expenses will be, and determine how long you can go on 75% of your current savings.  Set some realistic goals and expectations while you have a clear head (now), and as you start to approach a critical low-cash point stop and evaluate where you are vs. what you expected.<p>Keep in mind that this might make it harder for you to find a job if you take this personal sort of time and it doesn't work out.  I would only suggest doing this if you can live for 8 or 9 solid months on savings, and STILL have another 3-4 months of savings to live on after that.  6 months seems like a good checkpoint time, you should have made some serious measurable progress by then.  If you haven't, you'll need to start looking for alternate income, which may be time consuming and take a couple of months.<p>I would also suggest around the 5-6 month checkpoint trying to speak with some angel investors.

He didn't invent cyclic tag systems, and he didn't come up with the incredibly intricate construction needed to implement them in Rule 110. This was done rather by one Matthew Cook, while working in Wolfram's employ under a contract with some truly remarkable provisions about intellectual property. In short, Wolfram got to control not only when and how the result was made public, but to claim it for himself. In fact, his position was that the existence of the result was a trade secret. Cook, after a messy falling-out with Wolfram, made the result, and the proof, public at a 1998 conference on CAs. (I attended, and was lucky enough to read the paper where Cook goes through the construction, supplying the details missing from A New Kind of Science.) Wolfram, for his part, responded by suing or threatening to sue Cook (now a penniless graduate student in neuroscience), the conference organizers, the publishers of the proceedings, etc. (The threat of legal action from Wolfram that I mentioned at the beginning of this review arose because we cited Cook as the person responsible for this result.)""<p>That doesn't put things in a very good light.

I'm surprised your university even requires it of computer engineering students since advanced calc is usually a math-students-only upper-level course. Are you really doing that sort of advanced calculus, or is it more that you don't know enough calculus to know what ""advanced calculus"" means?<p>The techniques of the intro to intermediate calc classes are more relevant. That would be up to about Stoke's theorem and partial differentiation, and some differential equations and numerical analysis to round out the calculus. Statistics, topology and algebras (like matrix algebra) are different fields and have different impact on software development, which I won't get into here.<p>I don't have much experience with real-time computing, but if you're doing any sort of real-time machine control then you're dealing with physical systems, where differential equations and questions of numerical accuracy come into play. You need to know how your model works mathematically, how that model is implemented in hardware, and the types of error propagation which come from both.

2793225,comment,2792985,2792985,4,0,jjm,,,"I once thought like this however things changed once I realized at least a few interesting insights (read: NOT rules!). And this is strictly my opinion, which the OP has asked for.<p>* Not only must change absolutely come from the top, but so must the attitude. This may require getting new management, takes __money__, and time, and full support from your board. I really want to point to this one article by FC [1] but it's half link bait. None the less this list has characteristics (most of them, not all) of desired change (when you read it, remove 'social'). Sometimes, you may need to get rid of board members. The ones that say ""If it ain't broke why fix it?"" (because you found out it was never fixed in the first place, or it's broke cause customers don't exist anymore).<p>* Attitude must be filtered down from the top to the <i>lowest</i> of ranks. This takes time, and may require getting rid of dead weight _just like Silicon valley companies_. [2][3]<p>* Moving fast means just that. A large amount of people grew up with 'process', love to feel important, is all they know, and firmly believe there is nothing better. (Wish I could site some psychology papers on this with related research in 'process engineering'/'re-engineering' but I don't follow the field anymore and can't remember off the top of my head any...). Even for getting rid of people there is a huge, long process. Microsoft is also seen as NOT moving fast enough [4] (well, in comparison to some banks and health insurance corps MS moves at light speed).<p>* Get rid of people rather than 're-education'. Sometimes your teams need to be reborn and you _can't_ teach everyone to be at the same level and expect them to have new enthusiasm. Especially so when you have a huge honking boat of people at your Big Corp. People are different, and most likely they were hired for different reasons from when you 'started change'. Many older people (40+) at big corps today surprisingly don't have degrees (which Doesn't matter) nor want to learn anything new (what really matters). If they can't get excited over new tools (read: programming languages, platforms) how they heck will you get them excited with what your going to build (you need passionate people, impossible to have 100% on board with your passion. It's like finding co-founders for a startup).<p>* Applications and process are entrenched deep so that Big Corp must rely on them. This is really FEAR. Fear of change! See my first point, and if fear still exists keep firing.<p>* Once you eliminate dead wood, got rid of fear, have board approval, have great teams, you'll need to engrain in to the new culture some form of 'iterative process'. Customers are always moving targets and you should always be ready - to move and catch new ones. Well, unless your a Monopoly (in which case it doesn't matter and any change means less profit on the CEOs quarterly).<p>* Last bit of insight, sometimes you just can't change people. You can only assemble people, so assemble the ones you need.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1761924/top-ten-ways-ceo-s-must-change-to-lead-in-the-social-business-marketplace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/1761924/top-ten-ways-ceo-s-must-c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/03/17/whom-should-you-hire-at-a-startup-attitude-over-aptitude/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/03/17/whom-should-yo...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2010/05/05/23-insights-from-the-netflix-culture-deck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2010/05/05/23-insights-from-the-netfl...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952001....</a>",1311337892

Detecting XSS by looking for '<', '>', '(', or ')' in the URL is a very naive approach. It can be bypassed fairly easily and many XSS vectors could have payloads constructed that bypass this filter. Also, you're likely to get some false positives for a certain subset of applications, since parenthesis have legitimate uses.<p>2. I'm not sure on what basis the first part of the CSRF protection is valid or what it's trying to protect. Is it looking for an Accept header for application/json?<p>3. The second part of the CSRF protection, which looks at the referer header, seems buggy and easy to bypass. What is it trying to accomplish? Right now, it seems like it blocks POST requests where the referer is set and contains the server's hostname (which valid requests will have).<p>4. Detecting CSRF by looking for non-GET/POST methods is a bad idea unless your application specifically constrains itself to those two methods. Many modern applications are using PUT and DELETE internally for routing purposes.<p>5. Detecting LFI in the URL by looking for ../ is, again, naive (although less likely to lead to false positives than the XSS testing).<p>6. The most ""objectionable"" part here seems to be the ""fight back"" options. There are definitely some legitimate concerns about an attacker being able to get a targeted user banned from a site (after all, you can't distinguish between a failed CSRF that an attacker is sending and a failed CSRF that an attacker tried to convince a target to send). For the most part though, I don't think they're a big deal for a small, independent site that opts-in to them: they sound a lot like the Miserable Users mod for VB (<a href=""http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=93258"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=93258</a>)<p>That being said, no system that operates like a WAF is going to be perfect.

And there are a number of quality cg animation by students for example <a href=""http://vimeo.com/1470875"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/1470875</a>
Avatar is really an edge case, majority of the shows on Hulu don't cost that much.

A default is a delay or missing any coupon (interest) payments or failing to pay back a bond upon it's redemption date.<p>The reason why it is so important that Greece not default is that a huge amount of hedge funds and other speculative investors have purchased CDS guaranteeing Greek bonds will not default.  Because the CDS market is completely unregulated, we don't know how many billions or hundreds of billions in bets have been placed on a Greek default.  In fact, even people that don't even own Greek bonds could purchase a CDS guaranteeing a payout if Greece defaults.<p>In other words, if Greece does legally default by delaying any coupon payments or failing to pay any creditors, the ripples caused by all of the highly leveraged CDS could create another Lehman like scenario where large US and foreign banks don't have the capital reserves to cover all of the bets.<p>The real crime in all of this is that the CDS market is still completely unregulated and the hedge funds are legally allowed to bet on this.  The real world equivalent would be that you're allowed to take out a fire insurance policy on your neighbors house, and then proceed to smoke cigarettes and flick the lit butts at his house, hoping to spark a flame.  The hedge funds do this every day by taking out CDS and then proceeding to short Greek bonds.  If they can panic enough investors into running for the exits, they can trigger a default and become rich.",1311336996

Guess what, other people work too, they're obviously not going to be home in that time window.  I really think there's solid business in it for someone to set up a location where people can get their stuff shipped, then that company sends a guy on a freaking bike to get it to the recipient in the next hour (after notifying them they got the package) wherever said recipient is at that moment.

3971549,comment,3970566,3971211,72,0,fusiongyro,,,"The divide is fundamentally about choosing what's in charge of your system, the system being composed of your databases, your applications, and your supporting infrastructure (your scripts, your migrations, etc.) To relational database folk such as myself, the central authority is the database, and our principal interests are what ACID exists to provide: concurrent, isolated, atomic transactions that cannot be lost, on top of a well-defined schema with strong data validity guarantees. To us, what's most important is the data, so everything else must serve that end: the data must always be valid and meaningful and flexible to query.<p>The side that argues for ORM has chosen the application, the codebase, to be in charge. The central authority is the code because all the data must ultimately enter or exit through the code, and the code has more flexible abstractions and better reuse characteristics.<p>The reason for the disagreement comes down to disagreement about what a database is about. To the OO programmer, strong validation is part of the behavior of the objects in a system: the objects are data and behavior, so they should know what makes them valid. So the OO perspective is that the objects are reality and the database is just the persistence mechanism. It doesn't matter much to the programmer <i>how</i> the data is stored, it's <i>that</i> the data is stored, and it just happens that nowadays we use relational databases. This is the perspective that sees SQL is this annoying middle layer between the storage and the objects.<p>To the relational database person, the database is what is real, and the objects are mostly irrelevant. We want the database to enforce validity because there will always wind up being tools outside the OO library that need to access the database and we don't want those tools to screw up the data. To us, screwing up the data is far worse than making development a little less convenient. We see SQL not as primarily a transport between the reality of the code and some kind of storage mechanism, but rather as a general purpose data restructuring tool. Most any page on most websites can be generated with just a small handful of queries if you know how to write them to properly filter, summarize and restructure the data. We see SQL as a tremendously powerful tool for everyday tasks, not as a burdensome way of inserting and retrieving records, and not as some kind of vehicle for performance optimization.<p>At the end of the day, we need both perspectives. If the code is tedious and unpleasant to write, it won't be written correctly. The code must be written--the database is not the appropriate thing to be running a web server and servicing clients directly. OOP is still the dominant programming methodology, and for good reasons, but encapsulation stands at odds with proper database design. But people who ignore data validity are eventually bitten by consistency problems. OODBs have failed to take off for a variety of reasons, but one that can't be easily discounted is that they are almost always tied to one or two languages, which makes it very hard to do the kind of scripting and reporting that invariably crop up with long-lived data. What starts out as application-specific data almost invariably becomes central to the organization with many clients written in many different languages and frameworks.<p>We're sort of destined to hate ORM, because the people who love databases aren't going to love ORM no matter what, and people who hate databases will resent how much effort they require to use properly.",1337010779

Thee problem is that OOP is not well defined, it belongs to ""soft"" science, and relational databases are ""hard"" science. I have read the article about ORM and Vietnam, in we just have all of the symptoms of impedance mismatch.<p>I have to add that this issue is much deeper than a simple efficiency issue.

If we go a step further and replace certain collections of simulated cells with black boxes that behave the same way given an isomorphic set of inputs then we can have consciousness even more cheaply.<p>Your idea is not necessarily more grounded. Assumptions you make are: the substrate does not matter as long as it is not digital, you assume the replacement material will not itself have effects that result in vastly divergent actions in the long run. Yet the perturbations a neuron suffers will differ from those of nanodiamodons, will this be significant? You also take for granted the new replacement brain will not allow a very large viewpoint shift due to the new complexities and speeds of thought possible. That some invariance of self remains from morphism to morphism. That there is more resemblance between you and the the final being than you and a lemur like ancestor.<p>It is likely that the beings of the future will have far more sophisticated definitions of self and identity.<p>I personally think that physical bodies will give way to digital minds and its only a matter of time.

3971324,comment,3971136,3971136,1,0,algolicious,,,"This article is missing a couple of facts:<p>First, Apple has been designing its own ""Ax"" series of ARM chips with its purchase of PA Semi, currently with the A5/A5X.  If Apple switched to an Intel chip, they would no longer have the flexibility of a custom design or marketing claim to a custom chip in their product.<p>Second, though Apple contracts with Samsung to fabricate their ARM chips, they could presumably go to other companies to do the same thing.  There have been rumors of a future partnership with TSMC.  If Apple switched iOS to Intel's architecture, Apple would have much less flexibility with fabrication.<p>Third, switching CPU architectures means that your old software doesn't work immediately (we used to say ""out of the box"").  When Apple previously switched CPU architectures on the Mac, they had an emulator to allow running old apps, but this has a huge performance penalty that wouldn't fly on iOS: apps wouldn't be silky smooth on the latest product.  The situation here is a bit different than with the Mac because developers sell directly through the App Store, but Apple would have to take a temporary hit to their huge app selection while developers recompile their apps, and some developers may not have the resources to do so (because the work was done via contract, for example).  Perhaps static recompilation to retarget the architecture could be done by Apple for each app, but reading the EFF's copy of the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement, I don't see where Apple granted themselves the right to do this (correct me if I'm wrong).<p>To me, it makes more sense that Apple would want Intel to manufacture Ax ARM chips for them.  But given that Intel has shown huge resistance to ARM (probably due to the lack of manufacturer lock-in), it's unlikely that they would partner with Apple to do this.  The key advantage for Apple would be the use of Intel's cutting edge fabs, which would make their ARM chips the undisputed champions.",1337007764

And while this implementation might execute slower (.1 second vs .01 second), it is vastly simpler to read and refactor without screwing something up (ie: economically cheaper), and as for the performance argument, it only needs to be <i>fast enough</i>.",1337007743

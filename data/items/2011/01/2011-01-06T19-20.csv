When I run Linux, I don't Google ""linux media player"", I just search the repository and install things much easier.

When I search an app store/repository, I just get exactly what I want. It's less of a noticeable benefit if you know exactly what you want (because you can usually look for the app name and find their site), but it's helpful for searching for a category of apps.

Like most HN users, I've been following the development of computer/web technology over the last five years, and it seems pretty obvious that this is an area that will keep growing and have greater economic impact.<p>In a regular economic environment, we would want to capitalize on this by buying shares in companies that have newly had an IPO. However, with the American IPO market being what it is today, the opportunities for small-scale investors (say, for investments around 20000-60000 dollars) are very limited. I guess you could try your hand at angel investing, but it requires physical proximity to a lot of technology startupts. Not all of us live in California. With this investment form, it is also the question of putting all your eggs in one basket, also avoiding the problem of dilution/prefered shares in later investment rounds.<p>What would be ideal for investors like me would be some sort of angel fund that accepted money from the outside, or maybe a secondary market for trading pre-IPO shares of newly started computer companies.

It's an all around better language than js if you tend towards the functional side.<p>Iteration/comprehensions work like they should[1], destructuring simplifies extraction, there's a prototype binding construct in the language, less line noise, and everything is an expression. I also happen to like indent-significant languages and think it's a great DSL language.<p>I could certainly produce the same code writing in JS, but what would the advantage be? I'm already doing a build step for combo/minification and if not, a --watch compile gives roughly the same workflow as raw JS. I have to search for a snippet of text rather than going to a line number when I'm debugging, but I think the coding gains/cleanliness is worth the slightly increased debugging effort.<p>[1] With one gripe, `y = x + 1 for x in 0...10` got changed in August to match up with `z = x if x % 2` and friends (it was special cased) so y is now 10 instead of the array 1..10 and you have to wrap the comprehension in parens.",1294340980

Intel's dominance is because of engineering excellence, albeit coupled with some questionable business practices. Show me an ARM device that compares with a Core i7-950. Show me one that compares with one with 3 of the 4 cores turned off.<p>Microsoft, for that matter, has had versions of Windows for alternate platforms going back well over a decade. Those platforms got abandoned not out of some strategic affinity to x86 (much less to Intel), but simply because they didn't offer the advantage to be worth the bother: Instead they were pursued during the ""the Future is RISC"" era and it was preparing for the purported demise of x86.<p>As to manufacturers that were ""Microsoft exclusive"", show me even <i>one</i>.

Intel isn't sitting on their hands, though, and I have no doubt they'll have some killer solutions in the very near future.

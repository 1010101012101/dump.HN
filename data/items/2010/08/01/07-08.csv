Everyone by now should know that one of the golden rules is: ""make it work, make right, <i>then</i> make it fast."" Rakudo is (fwict) mostly still on the first step there.<p>* There are a large number of Perl 5 users who, years ago, got excited about Perl 6, and then eventually needed to get back to work with Perl 5 and subsequently went quiet on Perl 6. I think you're going to see more and more of these people getting re-interested in Perl 6.<p>* I keep hearing ""Perl 5 isn't going anywhere"". I think that's correct, however, that comment usually implies ""it's not going to disappear tomorrow"". I think it has a 2nd meaning, and that is: it's not going to continue to move forward very much now that Perl 6 is here.<p>* Perl 6 needs its own real forum. Perlmonks has a <i>decidedly</i> Perl 5 feel to it, and although #perl6 on irc is a friendly place, users need a regular online forum. Someone needs to just choose one, install it, pick a pretty theme, slap a Camelia logo on it, and get it running. Not a mailing list, not a google group, not irc, but an actual factual forum. It doesn't have to have karma or voting or a chatterbox right now, it just has to have a working forum.<p>* Go Offer Kaye!

A stock portfolio is by necessity non-diversified on that measure, though large investors can diversify by putting money into VC, angel, and private-equity funds, among other things. It's probably also geographically non-diversified, since some of the fastest-growing markets are hard to buy into (e.g. China is very picky about what kinds of shares it lets foreign investors buy).",1280648334

On the bright side, I've learned some really interesting things from these guys here and there, they are typically really, really bright and <i>extremely</i> well read.<p>I've had instances where I rewrote core code from these type of guys and gotten it down to 30% of its former size, <i>much</i> more understandable, much faster, and much more flexible.  But if we went into a meeting to discuss which is the better way, they would likely blow me out of the water (despite public failure) because they are young, inexperienced, and <i>supremely</i> confident.<p>I think maturity of attitude in software developers typically doesn't set in until 10+ years on the job.  So many of the young people entering the field are all educated on the new ""yet another revolution"" practices (TDD, Agile, etc), and they are so confident, because they are smart and educated (which they are) that it makes interacting with them almost impossible.  I've dealt with junior and intermediate developers that seem to think its impossible they could be wrong, they will cling to an idea even though you can easily give several examples where their theory breaks down.<p>I guess this is just the nature of our business, it is a bit too abstract, and education can be too easily mistaken for knowledge.",1280647292

It rang inside and I handed him the screwdriver.<p>Once inside, he was able to positively confirm he should be there.

1564886,comment,1564761,1564877,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Yeah, I'm stunned too, especially since you've had so much more exposure than I have.<p>My first collision with RBLs was actually back in '97 or thereabouts. I was just starting to really mess around on the internet, had visions of becoming a dial-up ISP, all that good stuff. Anyway, my ISP at the time ended up on the MAPS RBL due to the actions of a customer-of-a-customer. Rather than give in, they decided to fight them, and I got stuck in the middle.<p>For various reasons, I didn't have to deal with RBLs again for quite a while (I worked for other/larger companies, where it was someone else's problem; I left the computer industry entirely for a few years; so on), but eventually I got to be a tech-support/sysadmin monkey for a local ISP. They occasionally found themselves blackholed by one list or another for various reasons, whether it was a root'd box or a customer doing something dumb, usually a mailing list. Still, dealing with RBLs happened at least monthly.<p>Since starting my own business, I've had to deal with RBLs probably 3 or 4 times a year. Not super often, but I don't have a really massive list of clients yet either.<p>As yet another data point, nearlyfreespeech.net refuses to send out email notifications for planned outages. One of the reasons they give is that some percentage of their customers will lazily or mistakenly flag their message as spam and they'll end up on an RBL, which they don't want to deal with.<p>I'm actually not opposed to RBLs being used as a factor in products like SpamAssassin. For one thing, SA can be configured by the end-user, which means that if they miss out on anything, they only have themselves to blame; and secondly, so long as the RBL isn't the <i>sole</i> reason for dropping a message or connection, it doesn't bother me nearly as much.<p>At the ISP I worked for, ""missing email"" was probably the number 1 complaint, or close to it, and we spent an awful lot of time trying to fine-tune things so that legitimate messages wouldn't be lost.

Many rural peasants (still today, but even more in the past) eat a simple and often poorly balanced diet punctuated by occasional periods of near starvation, do demanding physical labor from an early age until their bodies break down, catch all sorts of diseases that suburban office workers are never exposed to, sometimes get serious bacterial infections when they suffer any kind of laceration, have vastly inferior treatments for pretty much every medical condition, even something simple like a broken ankle used to be permanently crippling, etc., and you find it &quot;amazing&quot; that life expectancy has improved?<p>If you want to talk about exposure to various carcinogenic compounds, any family who cooks on a wood fire in an open hearth in the middle of their house is breathing more smoke than all but the heaviest of cigarette smokers, worse than the worst air pollution Beijing has to offer.",1421121568

Goenka did everything (he passed a year ago) to make sure you don&#x27;t worship him.  He claims throughout his lectures that he is not a sage, but instead a mere &quot;householder.&quot;  He doesn&#x27;t say he&#x27;s enlightened.  He tells his story of having migraines, learning from another Vipassana leader the technique, and then dedicating his life to teaching others.<p>tldr; don&#x27;t knock it till you try it.<p>But I do agree with the author that there all elements of &quot;faith,&quot; whereas he claims you don&#x27;t need faith.  There are concepts in his lectures that imply belief in reincarnation for instance.  That being said, 95% of the course is just about developing concentration by focusing on your breathe, and awareness & equanimity by focusing on sensations of the body.",1421121520

Add to that that this really isn&#x27;t idiomatic Go style (code that panics all the time is frowned upon), and most people don&#x27;t bother.<p>This is a pretty good illustration of both the point in the article and why some folks don&#x27;t like Go.  It&#x27;s programming with error values; you can decide exactly what you want to do with the error, including panicking when you encounter one, and use the language&#x27;s own abstraction mechanisms to write that code.  OTOH, the reason why we have exceptions in most mainstream languages is because many, many C programmers wrote the same error-handling code over and over again, and eventually someone decided that it ought to be a language feature.  The <i>point</i> of a programming language is to abstract out common patterns that you&#x27;d otherwise have to write repetitively.",1421121463

He adds his own life story. I can&#x27;t think of any way that adoration of Goenka is encouraged. In fact, Goenka refused to confirm whether he had reached certain standard levels of semi-enlightenment (e.g. arahat) saying that he wanted to avoid idol-worship around his person.

8878033,comment,8877502,8877815,0,0,deathanatos,,,"> I get being against exceptions in a language like C++ where it can leave your program in a really weird state<p>If you&#x27;re programming in modern C++, then exceptions allow you cleanly (as in, clean code) leave your program in a very well defined state. You have to adhere to RAII, and there&#x27;s a lot of C++ shops out there that don&#x27;t allow RAII (and are wary of exceptions, because they ignore RAII). I&#x27;ve routinely used exceptions in C++ as a both efficient and clean way to propagate errors out to a stack frame that can handle them, fully confident that RAII will clean up as I go.<p>> and have some ugly performance implications<p>More than having an error object that the calling frame needs to check? If I understand Go (and, since it&#x27;s mentioned here and I think is relevant, Rust&#x27;s) setup, each stack frame between the frame that can handle the error and the one where the error occurred must check that an error did indeed occur, and if so return it. Rust makes this pretty through macros, and the article has some good thoughts on it for Go. Nonetheless, can the compiler compile that to better than an `if error { return error }` type check?<p>My understand of C++ exceptions is that this was basically how things _were_ done (but no longer). Previously, exceptions were managed by &quot;sjlj&quot; (short for setjmp, longjmp, the calls used to manage exceptions); any frame that _could_ have an exception would need to call setjmp on entry, and this was a bit hefty.<p>However, my understanding is that, at least for g++ on Linux, C++ has abandoned this in favor of a newer scheme called &quot;dwarf2&quot;[1]; this scheme is such that entering a &quot;try&quot; (or a stack frame where RAII would need to do actual cleanup) is free (rather, it is covered as part of the normal stack setup, really), leaving it gracefully is also free; only during actual stack unwinding do exceptions add code/performance penalties.<p>I think there is an unfortunate amount of information that C++ exceptions are inefficient left over from the sjlj days.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf</a>",1421121009

To protect their data, they use HSMs (actually, a <i>cluster</i> of HSMs) to encrypt the data. NASDAQ OMX has a direct, leased connection to the AWS Data Centers. The data is stored on s3 in encrypted form and only decrypted at the time of Redshift building the reports by getting the decryption key from the HSM (over the leased connection). They have multiple alarms and monitoring around Redshift access in their offshore ops center (e.g. the postgres audit table).<p>True data privacy and protection is near impossible but Amazon makes it easier to achieve high-levels of data privacy and security.<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/bdt206-see-how-amazon-redshift-is-powering-business-intelligence-in-the-enterprise-aws-reinvent-2014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/bdt206-see-how-a...</a><p><a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/nasdaq-finqloud/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/nasdaq-finqloud...</a>",1421120354

Under a NDA til May.<p>We are an east coast start-up and two months into creating our tech/product a large entity in the valley found out about us.  This big name invited us out and talked about buying us.  Well we have zero strong connections to such people like Paul Graham, but we did reach out to our network.  They said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if you should go or not, we&#x27;ve never had a billion dollar company like that make such an offer.&quot;<p>I wish I had found this post before wasting 4k on a trip and filing a provisional patent.  We&#x27;re a bootstrapped start-up.<p>Well when we flew out/got there to demo, this Goliath treated David like crap on a shoe.  They invited us to demo, but when we went to demo at their offices in the valley they were blocking our tech from working(worked perfectly throughout every place we tested in the Valley including outside their building).  Then they baited us with, &quot;We&#x27;d like to work with you, please tell us how you achieved this technological feat.&quot;  We took the bait and told them our trade secret.  They soon left our meeting, then came back and promptly kicked us out!  Right before leaving/being shown the door, one of these not so nice big wigs from X company said, &quot;The race is on, better hurry!&quot;<p>Ok, there was no guarantee of you buying us.  We were cool with that.  We weren&#x27;t cool with being treated like crap on shoe and then stepped on and disrespected!

8877889,comment,8877502,8877502,0,0,wyager,,,"Rather, (in Go) errors are values that violate type safety and destroy any correctness guarantees the compiler makes.<p>Languages like Rust and Haskell do this right. Both make heavy use of optionals for failable functions, and Haskell&#x27;s support for HKTs (and therefore Monads) allows awesome stuff like Maybe or Either chaining.<p>Monads allow you to write code that, syntactically, looks like you&#x27;re not doing any error handling. In reality, the error handling semantics are baked in at the Monad level. This makes sense, because error handling is usually very repetitive (e.g. &quot;Check if the function we just called failed. If it did, return early. Otherwise, keep going.&quot; ad infinitum). As a (pseudcoded) example:<p><pre><code>    parseTimeString :: String -> Either Error Time\n    parseTimeString string = parse string $ do\n            hours <- readHours\n            semicolon\n            minutes <- readMinutes\n            semicolon\n            seconds <- readSeconds\n            return (Time hours minutes seconds)\n</code></pre>\nIf any of those steps fails, the entire computation will stop and the error message will be returned. This is roughly equivalent to checking for &quot;nil&quot; (in Go) after every function call, except you don&#x27;t actually have to do it. This is defined in the code for the Either monad, which is at <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/src/Data-Either.html#Either"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/src/Da...</a> .

It&#x27;s such a powerful thing to do with someone you have just met.<p>Found this as well if anyone is interested - they have made a film about the study in down under Australia, says online it comes out in 2015, heres the link:<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/36-Questions-The-Movie/279767198842157"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/36-Questions-The-Movie/279767...</a><p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3511822/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3511822/</a><p>PLD",1421118192

My city (Albany, NY) was selected as an early experiment in Charter Schools in the state, as it&#x27;s the state capital, and the public schools have a bad reputation.<p>In the media, the message is always about quality of education and high standards -- because the audience is the political class who funds the schools. But the outreach to parents (found in bus shelters, pamphlets, hip hop radio, etc) is a message that usually is around childcare and uniforms. Longer school hours + longer school year == less daycare expenses and arrangements.<p>In terms of outcomes, it&#x27;s all over the map. Several charters have closed for poor performance, and some do well.",1421118188

It&#x27;s the first language I&#x27;ve used where I give as much attention and design to the &quot;sad paths&quot; as I do to the &quot;happy path&quot;. And I&#x27;m very comfortable navigating through text files and folding blocks of code, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me if handling an error costs me a few lines.<p>Macros like try! might take up less space, but is that really a bottleneck for your work?",1421118099

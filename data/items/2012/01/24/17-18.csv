The program has a GUI that is very modular and customizable but the command-line interface is the primary interface.

If we woke up in a world tomorrow where technical skills were <i>not</i> highly in demand, but, say, the two main growth sectors involved writing and music, how many of today's Google employees would be able to successfully retrain as novelists, journalists, violinists, poets, historians, and editors? My guess is some would and some wouldn't; and a number would need significant time to do so, and/or would end up as only mediocre employees in their new occupation.<p>That's how I feel with computers, anyway, that I've in effect pulled a lucky straw: I've been interested in and good at computers since I was like 8, and it turns out they pay. If the money was elsewhere, I'm not sure how easily I'd be able to switch. Likewise, I'm not sure how easy it'd be for an adult who was never fascinated with and adept at technology to go the other way, and ""become a techie"" through self-study, purely because they think it's important/lucrative, as opposed to because they have the sort of interest/drive/skill that most techies have.<p>Or put differently, I don't think everyone is the same or perfectly malleable; not necessarily due to genetics, but at least by the time they reach adulthood people have different skills/proclivities and are more or less adept at learning certain things. Since the universe isn't aligned in some cosmically fair manner, some people's skills/interests align with what's currently in demand, and other people's don't, which puts the people out of alignment in a more difficult place, like me in an age where being court poet, painter, or musician was the main path for middle-class kids to advance, and engineering was seen as a more working-class endeavor.",1327427508

I'm not certain if the latter can be done in a performant manner, so I'd probably settle for a few compromises if they were well argued.<p>For example, a natural join between two tables could be represented as an S-expression:<p><pre><code>    (join a b)\n</code></pre>\nThe actual format is probably irrelevant. You could represent it as JSON or XML or some binary protocol. What would matter is that you were transferring a standard structure (i.e. a list consisting of 'join', 'a' and 'b').<p>Compare this to SQL where you'd actually send a raw string:<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM a NATURAL JOIN b\n</code></pre>\nAlthough because SQL doesn't follow the relational model particularly closely, usually you'd write something more like:<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM a JOIN b ON a.id = b.a_id\n</code></pre>\nBoth of these statements are much harder to parse than a S-expression represented by some known format.<p>As well as being harder to parse, it's also harder to combine SQL. For example, perhaps I want to add a selection to limit the join:<p><pre><code>    (select (join a b) (= x 1))\n</code></pre>\nCombining expressions in a S-expression is trivial, but in SQL it's more complex. You can't just wrap one expression in another - you'd want to extend an existing statement with a ""WHERE"":<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM a JOIN b ON a.id = b.a_id WHERE x = 1\n</code></pre>\nMore complex expressions become a mess of subqueries, and very hard to parse. Man ORMs actually represent queries as ASTs internally and only convert them into SQL at the last moment.

3505757,comment,3500147,3505567,1,0,SilasX,,,"You're showing the same kind of insubstantive pattern-matching I've come to see and expect from supposed legal experts.  Here, you see an ""extreme"" argument and assume, purely on that basis, that there must be something wrong with it, and the truth is in some kind of ""middle"".  But let's trace back what the actual exchange was.<p>1) I said (trying to start from a more general, uncontroversial figure of merit) that one sign of a bad legal system is that it fails to let people know, with (imperfect) confidence, and without ""experts"", whether they're breaking the law.  This means breaking <i>any</i> law: remember, it's not praiseworthy that people can be certain about one <i>particular</i> law.  What matters is whether they're certain they're not breaking any law, because you only need to break <i>some</i> law to be punished, not a <i>particular</i> one.  It's little consolation that my interpretation of the murder laws was correct if they string me up on bizarre endangered species ones!<p>(Already you should see the irrelevance of your invocation of ""but you can tell that killing over a parking spot is illegal"", but perhaps I go that far given your legal expert self-identification and your contempt for the ""geek"" view!)<p>2) I then pointed out that currently, you can have no such confidence.  This would be confidence that, ""for all people, it is not the case that there exists one law that they are currently breaking (or breaking on a regular basis)"".  I substantiate this by pointing to the standard recommendation from experts.<p>3) You claim that it would be unreasonable to expect this of a legal system.  (You further ignore the citing of the principle of ""ignorance of the law is no excuse"".)  This would suggest that no society has pulled it off.  But obviously, you can't defend such a position, so you substitute it (per the pattern-matching I mention at the beginning of the post) with the weaker standard that there is some uncertainty at some margins.  But that was never in dispute!<p>4) So, it is clear that a) the standard I cited is reasonable, and b) many current legal systems violate it, making them no better at ""the law"" than the geeks whose legal expertise you ridicule,<p>At this point I should add that geeks already have set up existing systems for ""how to do it right"".  Rather than, say, expect that everyone should closely follow libraries of laws and cases, they have the RFC system, which provides a public, since point of reference that is constantly, pro-actively reconciled with conflicting notions, rather than waiting years for the supreme court to have someone go through the dance to get a case before them and give them an excuse to talk about it.<p>No, it's not perfect, but it satisfies the basic requirements one ought to expect, in that it allows people to actually learn how to stay clear of conflict with a reasonable amount of effort and time.",1327427101

The cost to scale a software business is negligible, compared to consulting where you grow relative to the number and quality of people you can find.<p>I'll say it again, the amount of time you have to sell is relative to the people you have, and how efficient/good they are, and how efficient your management overhead is to leave people free to bill hours.<p>EVERY BUSINESS IS NOW A SOFTWARE BUSINESS.  It doesn't matter what industry they're in.  Either they get it, and get with it, or they're gone in 10 years when someone's eating their lunch with little to no effort thanks to a great systemized + automated software system.  In many ways, software is the next industrial revolution.<p>CONSULTING'S HOURLY BREAKDOWN IS DIFFERENT THAN PRODUCTS.<p>Every consulting dollar is generally cut into 3 parts:\n- get the work\n- do the work\n- manage the work<p>At a $100/hr rate, you see it's not so pretty when it's more than one or two people.<p>What does this formula have to do with how you price a software product?  I do both and know the difference. :)<p>CONSULTING PROFITABILITY IS IN SYSTEMIZING AND AUTOMATING, LIKE ANY BUSINESS. Manage each area the best it can be (via enough, but not too much systemization and automate the sh*t out of everything) and you can get a 60-70% profit rate.<p>I FIND IT HARD TO CONFUSE CONSULTING AND PRODUCT BUSINESSES. With this article, for a consulting business that switched to a product business and then look back and talk about consulting, it all seems a little confusing to me.<p>WHY? While smaller businesses might be able to get away with a mindset of ""it's not important"" for a little while, growth unfortunately makes this a ""cost of doing business"" to manage the ""bottom line"".<p>WHAT? Just like we systemize and automate our software products to do everything, administrative minutiae too, can and should be systemized and automated.<p>HOW? Connect a business' preferred project management tool to billing and accounting systems automatically.  This is what I do. I manage several projects with a few hours of time a month that I get paid for dozens of hours of work via my developers.  My system is honed and works.<p>ME: I don't die to track every second, but you better believe I have to track my billing unit, the hour, or fixed price.<p>There is truth to the idea, though that having to track every second or micromanage means you have the wrong person.  You do, however, need some checks and balances to keep things moving on their own for everyone's piece of the pie, and a big part of that is ""are we on schedule"".<p>TRICKS: I'm constantly working on my systemization and automation.  It will never end, or be perfect because there's always new tools and technologies and processes becoming possible.<p>Forwarding your receipts to one address, PDF printing all purchases, and writing a quick web app that downloads credit card statements and asks you to link them up to whatever (whether it's the book keeper or not) isn't stoneage thinking.  It can be simplified, and should be.<p>THE ONLY TRUTH I KNOW IN BUSINESS: We still have these business problems.  They're not a technology problem, but technology can help.<p>THOSE MAGICAL PEOPLE WHO SIGN THE CHEQUES.  Consulting issues of tracking time are another.  Not all customers are comfortable with flat rate.  It's easy to puff our chest once we have a practice up and running, but the reality is pricing in consulting is one of the toughest things to get a handle on relative to the place(s) you work, and for the type of work you do.<p>Finding a middle ground with new clients (seeing if the client is more comfortable with per hour vs fixed fee) is far more important.  I always suggest doing a small fixed fee project to build trust in the beginning and make sure both sides are happy.  After that being comfortable enough to say ""I think I can save you money hourly"" is fine.  Or not.",1327426134

3505685,comment,3504981,3505266,0,0,nirvana,,,"I'm an objectivist and I think this has nothing to do with the RIAA/MPAA.  I think its just corrupt politicians flexing their muscles.  They raid the MegaUpload people, charge them with a bunch of crimes[1] (that wouldn't stick in any legitimate court) and now all the competing services are in a panic.  That panic means those competing services are easy to control.<p>But the real target is the public.  You trot someone out, show off his fancy house and his fancy cars, and you go a long way to sell in the media the idea that these people are  like drug lords-- making a lot of money doing something criminal.<p>Yet, I'm not aware of megaupload doing anything criminal.  (I do believe that IP is legitimate, from a moral standpoint, but I don't consider the current IP laws to be consistent or moral.)<p>MegaUpload was a stand up citizen as far as I can see- they did occasionally host copyrighted content, and when they were made aware of it, they took it down.  But as a digital-locker provider, it is not they who are morally responsible for the content of their service, but the people who put things in their digital lockers.<p>Raiding MegaUpload is like seizing every single house in Los Angeles because one of them was a crack den.<p>It makes no sense.  I think the MPAA and RIAA don't really have any power, they're just organizations useful to the government.<p>This is all about government power, and the government wanting power over the singular medium of communication that it doesn't already control.  You can't run a TV news station in the USA without being controlled by the FCC (and they exercise editorial control, though of course for obvious reasons this isn't made public in the news).  Same goes for newspapers, etc.  But on the internet, for now, you can say whatever you want.<p>SOPA/PIPA, et. al. are not at all about intellectual property.  They're about control.  That's why we're going to be seeing them re-introduced with different spins over and over until sometime we're all distracted by something else and they get passed.<p>This is how we got the PATRIOT ACT.  That piece of legislation was sitting on the shelf waiting for 9/11.  Well, the 9/11 ""we can pass whatever we want so long as we call it terrorism related"" age has passed. Both Bush and Obama were trying to pass SOPA type internet control under the guise of fighting terrorism, but they weren't able to do it.<p>So, they made an attempt with the claim that it was to fight ""Piracy"".<p>This claim is obviously bogus.  But now a lot of the standard anti-IP types are going on a campaign against the RIAA and MPAA, having been riled up.... which means it might just be easier to pass the legislation to control the internet under some other guise.... maybe attached to the next debt ceiling bill perhaps.<p>I'm not interested, and not going, to engage in a debate about whether the concept of ""Intellectual Property"" has any moral legitimacy.  I think its wholly irrelevant to this discussion.<p>This issue is, as with almost everything the government does, all about control.  Piracy, or ""terrorism"", are only excuses to try and get us to accept their grabbing of more power.<p>[1] Specifically here I mean ""Money Laundering"", which I've read a legal opinion that says is written in such a way that they can make it stick to anybody, and that this is its purpose.  Its the catch all law so that they can always convict.  Basically, if you get your paycheck deposited in your checking account, you move some money to your savings account, then you later go and buy something with a credit card, and then pay your credit card bill from the savings account, you've engaged in ""money laundering"".  Apparently the law is completely subjective.",1327426114

I followed his IMDB page and discovered he has participated on the producer + director level of several films.  He is said to be 'known for' The People vs. Larry Flynt and Men in Black, but was involved only in the sound of those films.<p>16-LOVE produces similar results: virtually nothing on Wikipedia or IMDB.  Its IMDB article says it is similar to films such as ""Zookeeper"", and is rated at around 5 stars.  Completely distinct from the IMDB results, RT claims it is 100% fresh with 39 reviews.  It was directed by and produced by Mr. Lipsius.<p>Conspicuously absent in my searches were any torrent offerings.<p>---<p>Here's what I think:<p>I think 16-LOVE was not a popular film, and just plain didn't do well.

Your original claim was ""One of the most basic expectations of the legal system is that a citizen should be able to know, with confidence, whether they're breaking the law based on a reasonable search of available resources on the matter, without having to contact a specialist (lawyer)."" Which of course depends on your definition of 'reasonable search', but which for an 'average' definition of 'reasonable' (i.e., of you ask 100 people, the average of those), is not true. For example there are many tax related matter that are highly specialized, and for which it is completely reasonable to expect people to use professional services to make sure they get it right. Or, as another example, legal procedure - there are so many rules and customs that it's perfectly reasonable to <i>not</i> expect an average citizen to be able to figure it out, and require a licensed lawyer be used to perform certain tasks in legal proceedings.

Also a book is more portable, more flexible and it feels better to use. I read the most when I'm in bed but I can't stand reading on a tablet in bed. Or in the bathroom.<p>I spend most of my time at home surfing the internet, browsing forums and writing code. I read all the time online and yet I prefer physical paper for reading.",1327424423

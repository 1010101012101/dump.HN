What the web is lacking isn't breadth or engagement capacity. Hell, Wikipedia has engagement capacity. What the web lacks is information with the depth, quality and low entry barrier of textbooks. You can have depth and quality with stuff like Google Scholar, but the barrier of entry is absurd, and you can have breadth with a plethora of other sites, but without expertise on the matter at hand you'll only find shallow information directed at the general public. WikiBooks and OpenCourseWare are probably good examples of things which are helping alleviate with lack.",1295546288

As for whether the algorithm is ""unacceptable"", that depends on the application. For games? Yeah, this is probably far from your best option for generating mazes. But for cases where you absolutely must have a uniform spanning tree, your options are limited. Wilson's is much better than Aldous-Broder, but still not perfect. Robin Houston has described a variant that combines both Aldous-Broder and Wilson (doing AB until about 30% of the field is filled, and then switching to Wilson's) which empirically improves the odds quite a bit, but as long as you're doing a blind random walk, you're pretty much never guaranteed to finish.",1295545947

2124484,story,,,1,7,Skywing,"Review my Startup: Radius - location based message broadcasting",,"Radius is my current project. My goal is to create a multi-dimensional, location-based communications platform without any walls. My inspiration for this is Citizen's Band radio.<p>Currently, the service itself is simple. You visit the stream page, and you may broadcast messages to other users within a 5 mile radius of you. Messages are transmitted to other users in real time. Messages are also indexed with their geographical location, basically creating a geo-tagged message board where the message threads are real world locations (this enables non real time communication).<p>I'm going for a non room-based approach because I feel like that hampers the utility of this, and ultimately my vision is closer to CB radio than it is to IRC. I'm working on several different clients at the moment. The only one I'm showing here is the web front end. I'm finishing up an iPhone application for communicating over Radius.<p>Gotcha's: This relies on browser geolocation reporting, at the moment. because of that, this doesn't seem to work at all on IE. Firefox connects a little slowly. It seems to work best in Chrome. You must allow geolocation reporting when the browser prompts you for it. It also relies on websockets which restricts browsers to more modern versions.<p>Requests: I'm looking forward to feedback on this. So, if you check this out and have any feedback for me I will make sure to fix it, or incorporate it if I can. I made a thread about this about a week ago, but it didn't get much attention because I posted it at around 1AM.<p>I'm severely lacking in the UI and UX department. All of my time has been focused on the back end, so far. I'm looking for suggestions on how to make the message stream visually appealing and engaging, too! :)<p>The fun part!

My co-founder and I had been coding alone for the last few years and we really wanted some people to develop relationships with who were doing the same types of things as us.<p>2) Introduction to the top angel investors in the valley (to get our next round of funding).  The guys at i/o definitely gave us a huge amount of introductions.  There were 150 angel investor / VCs at our demo day for only 6 companies (that is a pretty badass ratio!)<p>3) Help with our product.  While we thought we knew what we were doing, the guys at i/o taught us a lot about how to build products people want.<p>Overall the experience for us was great.  From the time we joined in June we went from around 200K users to over 1.7 million users today.  We just recently wrapped up our seed round of funding (400K) from some of the top investors in the valley, including Charles River Ventures and Dave McClure's 500 Startups.  Additionally we made friends that will last a lifetime.<p>i/o has one of the best track records I have heard of as well.  There were 6 companies that joined, 3 of those companies (including us) went on to raise a solid seed round, 2 were acquired and 1... well is pivoting, so we will see what happens with them.<p>Jim Young (Hot or Not) was the main i/o partner who got us to join.  I will never forget the way he described incubators (as it was one of the main reasons we joined as opposed to waiting for the next YC cycle).  He said, ""Incubators are like martial art houses, different incubators specialize in different things depending on what you want to do.""  I found this really true with i/o, because they seemed to specialize in costumer facing startups based around social media and entertainment.  That was exactly us so it was a perfect fit.<p>One main point is this, there are many good people out there who can get you to where you want to go.  YC is just one of many routes to what I think is every entrepreneurs goal: Building a successful company that greatly benefits your life.<p>Enjoy yourselves!",1295544359

Calls you made were bridged through, so, you could have an 800# pointed to your wildfire number and call from a payphone.  You would call in, listen to your voicemail and with voice commands be able to direct it to call the person back, conference in someone, etc.  If you were listening to messages when an incoming call was coming in, wildfire would tell you that you had an incoming call, etc.<p>The real power of it was building your contact list.  If you called my number, Wildfire would interview you.  I couldn't find any of the old audio demos that used to be online, but, it went something like this:<p>Chris isn't available can I take a message?  you speak the message, Wildfire would say, can I ask for a callback number?  you would give the number, I heard, 555-1414 is this correct? yes.  Is this a work or mobile number?  work.  I don't recognize this number, may I ask for more information?  Yes (would register your name, additional numbers, weekend number, etc)  Ok, thank you, I'll have Chris call you when he get the message.<p>At this point, Wildfire would page me with a code, # of messages, etc.  Keep in mind, while you were on the line, Wildfire was already calling any registered numbers I had to try and contact me and would bridge the connection if possible.  You call in, listen to the message, Wildfire would connect the call.  During the call, if you needed to conference in someone, you said  WildFire  'Here I am'  Call Bob, 'Do you want to add this call to a conference?' Yes.  'Dialing'<p>If you called into the 800#, you could also direct calls from there.  Depending on the interview Wildfire got from an incoming caller you could say:  Wildfire, 'Here I am'  Call Bill, 'I have a work and mobile number' Dial work, 'Dialing'.  Wildfire would listen in, make sure the call was connected, offer to dial the mobile number if you didn't get a connection, etc.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOq2Ks-aPcA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOq2Ks-aPcA</a>  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYCxtagsvdM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYCxtagsvdM</a><p>are two demos that I could find.<p>I've written so many notes regarding this.

I got slightly annoyed, because I am neither. I'm ""cohabitating"" or whatever the awkward English term for it is. Over here, such an arrangement is very common, and even offers some legal protection. There are many couples who live together, raise children, and never marry. There's no difference between these and married couples, except that the latter group shows up in global statistics and the former group show up as singles, even though it's not an accurate view.<p>> while rates of religious attendance are seventh lowest among all countries, suggesting a limited access to familial and religious support networks.<p>The average Swede would consider this being seventh from the top, not seventh from the bottom. There's also no lack of access to religious support, it's that people don't <i>want</i> it.<p>The numbers will tell you that a majority of Swedes are christians, because the number you get is the number of members of various churches, but until recently, membership in the state church was automatic, and a lot of people get married in a church or baptize their children in a church, despite being atheist or agnostic or apathetic to the whole thing.<p>So the official numbers say we are a christian nation where noone goes to church regularly.

In the end however while we are building it for Azure we may not end up using.<p>1. Mediochre deployment story<p>Honestly, it could be far worse.  Azure is deployed by uploading a compiled package via an HTTP(S) REST API.  There are PS tools allowing this to be scripted too.  In fact, all of Azure can be interacted with via their REST API which is one of the good things they did.  Despite this, it is nowhere near as nice as a Heroku deployment or any of the other push deployment PaaS providers.<p>2. The SDK isn't all that great<p>The SDK (now at ver. 1.3) is yet another example of Microsoft's tendency to write nigh untestable APIs (mostly concrete classes, almost no interfaces, etc.).  They also apparently don't keep the docs up to date on the latest REST API changes (it was actually suggested that we could use fiddler with their Silverlight management console to figure it out).<p>3. Azure storage is neat, but in the end insufficient and SQL Azure is missing key features and is expensive<p>Personally, I don't think it makes a lot of sense to build most cloud based applications on top SQL, but that is for another debate.  In the end we've chosen to run Mongo on a worker role for our storage needs.  I really can't wrap my head around how Azure tables could be useful, and blob storage is really just I way to upload files for CDN or provide storage for VHDs.<p>4. It's kind of expensive compared to the competition<p>Not much else to say here, but the only reason I can think of for this is that MS doesn't feel the need to compete with the other PaaS providers, which in turn would imply that the typical developer that utilizes PaaS isn't their target market.<p>As seems typical for MS, they are targeting the less competent enterprise and business markets and trying to sell them the cloud like it's the next SQL server, offering lots of integration points (painful as they are to use) with existing Microsoft technology (e.g., you can actually use local AD servers to authenticate with Azure).<p>Bottom line, AFAICT Azure isn't for us.",1295543287

I can use tracepoints to print anything at any point in code, including the callstack.  The nice thing though is I can turn the tracepoints on and off while never pausing/breaking the code.<p>Additionally I can attach a debugger to a running process.<p>Plus with more modern features, like historical debugging), I can go back to predefined instances of time (like a past exception that was thrown) and examine the callstack then.<p>And the other thing you can do interactively is (a) change the value of variables, (b) change the code, and (c) change the instruction pointer.  I regularly do (a) & (c) -- (b) less so.  It's a huge time saver when you step over function foo() and realize, hey it didn't set ABC.  So then just set the IP back to foo(), but this time step into it.<p>When I would consult I would often find and fix bugs in a day or two with oode that I'd only seen for the first time, while others had been looking for weeks in code they had helped build.  I'd look at their debugging techniques and it was obivous that they were often just not at all efficient.",1295542803

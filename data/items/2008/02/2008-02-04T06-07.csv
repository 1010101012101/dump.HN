Perhaps everything would have to be redone with RFID, but once done, the balls could be mapped simply by touching a new cup. I'm imagining clear marbles, or perhaps ping-pong balls, with potentiated tri-color LEDs indicating their current state. ...Or we could do it the easy way, and just fill the cups with paint.<p>Also, I imagine their next project to be using a large one of those ""elastic pegboard"" things (normally used to teach elementary Maths), along with several differently colored rubber bands, to simulate a piano roll.",1202108033

I think my application could be approved, but I've just found out that the total costs for assisting there are very expensive (I could manage traveling alone, but traveling + local accommodation, which I first thought was included on the course and now I know is not, is just excessively expensive for what I could afford now... US dollars are a very expensive currency in my country).<p>But maybe any of you assisted to some previous years of the Summer School and might give me some pointers about whether it would be good for me to use my savings (and maybe some extra money) for going there.",1202107868

Xfire doesn't seem to be a very big deal, and it's hard to say why Yahoo felt threatened. Xfire's VP of engineering had worked at Yahoo on similar stuff-- in fact, he was listed as an inventor on the patent Yahoo sued over-- so perhaps there was something personal about it. My guess is that someone at Yahoo goofed. At any rate they didn't pursue the suit very vigorously.</i><p>I can't help but wonder if pg thinks the same way about software patents now that there is a very real chance that his own patent could be used against him at the whim of someone at a company he's been publically bad-mouthing for some time.",1202106633
108982,comment,108722,108978,0,0,tx,,,"It is not. Depends on what do you refer to by ""current practices"". Dumb CRUD projects surely can be coded on the fly using so-called ""agile"" approach without much thinking. ""Steer  left or right as required"" works very well for them.<p>The thing is, most of online discussions, <i>especially</i> on YC are revolving around web-based CRUD to-do lists or something similar, whose complexity (something Dijkstra was very much concerned about) is close to zero.<p>Therefore ""current pratices"" cannot be used as a good example of software engineering in general, since most ""engineers"" are too busy dreaming of getting rich by implementing a high school programming project over a weekend and selling it to google.<p>I am fully aware that I do not represent the common ""spirit"" of this board by stating these views, but there is no way in hell you can do software for F-22's pilot's helmet can be done using ""current practices"" you're referring to. In fact, the best ""current practice"" (as some MBAs believe) is to outsource your typical CURD job to India. Hard to argue with that.",1202106490

Just do a gut check after reading his opening paragraph:<p>""One thing about Jerry Yang that I always have admired is that he cares. He cares about his employees. He cares about his products. He cares about his shareholders. Most of all he cares about building a world class company that can be great at what it does.""<p>And the solution to building a great company is to allow it to be swallowed by <i>Microsoft</i>, most likely losing its best employees and its brand in the process?<p>Sorry, no.<p>(The deal might be the best option for <i>shareholders</i>, but when you talk about building a Great Company, you should be thinking of more than just money imho)",1202106228
108978,comment,108722,108976,0,0,michaelneale,,,"yes, very much so. Just thought it was funny (it was how I read the headline at first). There was an amusing anecdote about a company not being allowed to start coding until 70% of the project time had elapsed - taken out of context (and there is a LOT of context) that is somewhat contrary to current practices.",1202106062

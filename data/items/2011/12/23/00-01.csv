But I think nothing short of a Constitutional amendment will stop future laws like these, though. But I agree after we stop SOPA and PIPA, we'll need to focus on bills that can ensure nothing like SOPA can even be proposed again. There needs to be an ""Internet first"" stance.<p>The Internet is probably the most important thing humanity has built so far, and I think we're just at the beginning with this. And our clueless politicians already want to mess around with it to stop a few old business models from failing. And they want to do that by trying to pass a bill a week before Christmas, without any serious debate and disregarding the experts. I think that's very dangerous and foolish.",1324601893

For instance, the "".."" feature, which allows a template to reference a parent context, only impacts the compiled code if it's used.<p>Finally, for performance-sensitive deployments, Handlebars provides a precompiler that eliminates the need to compile the template on the client.

I'm going to cover my reasoning behind this in a future post, but I didn't want a heavy focus on mathematics to take away from the impact of the article.<p>In the meantime, check out the first image on this page (<a href=""http://dropshado.ws/post/12971305087/webkit-zoomed-out-font-size-threshold"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dropshado.ws/post/12971305087/webkit-zoomed-out-font-...</a>); the ends of each line of text combine to form a classic x^2 curve. This supports the claim that w = l^2 (but it does not prove it true, obviously).<p>Most people simply won't read (or even be able to follow) a barrage of mathematical reasoning, modeling, and graphs. That's why I left most of those things out of this article. However, these things are the hallmarks of the research I've done thus far.<p>Finally, there is a huge benefit to this approach to typography that is worth expounding upon here.<p>By establishing a mathematical basis to relate typographical variables, you can predict and control type with algorithms instead of relying upon arbitrary selection from designers.<p>This opens up the doors for sophisticated tools (like the Golden Ratio Typography Calculator) or even cooler stuff, like design controls that allow users to experiment with different fonts/sizes while adjusting all typographical and spatial values based on the resulting line height of the primary text (this is the vertical baseline grid on steroids).<p>For me, the bottom line is this: Designers rely on arbitrary selection for things like line heights and line widths, and I am convinced there's a better way to go about this.<p>Research like this is only the tip of the iceberg, obviously, but at the very least, I will continue to ask the tough questions and to challenge the baseless status quo.",1324598435

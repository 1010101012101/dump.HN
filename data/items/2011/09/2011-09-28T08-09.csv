Also in the past I've  incorrectly read the program as being a one way ticket to the valley  and I was very impressed that Paul was selling it as a college experience and a network to tap into above all else.<p>And I got to tell you something: It's the first time in my life that anybody from THE valley said out loud ""I think it's cool to have a startup in NYC"". I've been in the scene here for years before it was cool, and it was music to my ears to hear that. And of course we'd love it if Paul announced that they were coming to NYC -- but I came to realize that if they did that part of what makes Y Combinator so cool wouldn't come along for the ride (sort of like opening CBGB in Vegas).",1317200346

3047061,comment,3046038,3046038,5,0,rheide,,,"I've worked in Japan for 5 years at one of the major companies, and I think there's a bit more to it than the facts mentioned in the article. At my company we were developing embedded software, yet only a very small subset of the people working there were educated programmers, and only a very small subset of those people were actually good, productive programmers. And of those good, productive programmers, quite a lot of them were forced to do tedious repetitive tasks by the higher-ups.<p>I think the reason this happens is because people are rewarded differently. For example, if there's a crunch  session and you manage to solve your bit of the problem with a fancy algorithm that means you get to go home early, while all the others work the 'less smart' way and spend overtime in the company, then the company will look favorably on those who worked longer, not those who worked in less time.<p>Since the culture expects you to work overtime anyway some people will believe that there's no point in working smart but less, since you'll only be working smart but the equal amount of hours anyway if you want to be respected. I've seen plenty of my colleagues following this routine and I've seen some foreigners fall for this trap too. It's a kind of culture that does not reward change.<p>As for me, I couldn't care less about how people perceived me so I just went on designing things the 'right' way (and going home in time for dinner). It worked out very well for me, but I doubt that a Japanese person could pull it off as easily, since they have to worry about their reputation a lot more than foreigners.",1317200164

I have about 15.000 high-resolution tagged photos on flickr - that's lock-in.<p>Simplicity and transparency (from where I'm standing) seem like the things that helped Dropbox proliferate - no fuss, just a directory that syncs, but it also means they have no way to monetize their service (they haven't made a dime from me yet) and they provide no added value.<p>Now, consider my case. I don't even have to remove the Dropbox client. The folder is already mirrored on my computer, when I install the next version of Ubuntu I have to explicitly add the PPA and install the proprietary Nautilus extension. If I don't do that, I can just drag the folder to another service. At some point it's easier to quit than to continue using it, which is why I predict Dropbox is fucked once Google provides the same transparent syncing with added value of its services.",1317200129

Secondly, the Elder Scrolls part of the name tends to be subordinate to whatever the name of the current game is. These both make it extremely, extremely unlikely that anyone would ever seriously confuse Scrolls as being a Bethesda game within the Elder Scrolls series. Thirdly, the games are nothing alike: Elder Scrolls games are first person single player RPGs, it's similar to Fallout 3, Red Dead Redemption, and Grand Theft Auto, except in a medieval fantasy setting; Scrolls is a multiplayer trading card game with ""tactical"" elements, it's similar to Magic: The Gathering, Culdcept Saga, or Yu-Gi-Oh, nobody could possibly confuse the two even if they only managed to see 10 milliseconds of game play.<p>The only people who could conceivably be confused into accidentally buying Scrolls when they meant to buy Skyrim would either have so little idea of what Skyrim was or so little grasp on reality that they would be equally likely to buy Halo or a bag of M&Ms.<p>This lawsuit is like if Blizzard were to sue the company that makes ""Raft Wars"" because it was infringing on the ""Warcraft"" trademark.",1317198656

I built the site to scratch my own itch, and because I had a hunch that it might be useful to other people, but now I'm at a technical/spiritual impasse.<p>The basic idea is to mirror a Gmail account's attachments, and make them instantly searchable/sortable.  The original idea was to provide a single email address per user account which can accept and parse attachments (i.e., via forwarding), but I found myself gravitating toward sync.  So both sync and email forwarding are currently supported, but I'm not sure how stable it will be under load (or any part of the site, for that matter).<p>I'm really interested to know if anyone has ideas for more features (I have a few of my own), and also whether you think there is a market for this site.  There are definitely bugs, so caveat emptor:<p>https://attachcache.com<p>Please try it out and let me know what you think.<p>Thanks!<p>Noah",1317196958

It takes so much time for your idea and research to be visible... you write the paper, it get reviewed, presented on a conference, published in journals and then months/years later someone actually sees it.<p>Compare that to the web, where an elaborate blog post and a project on GitHub is enough to become visible to the entire world within hours.<p>Percentage wise, how much influence did academic papers have on your day to day work in the last year compared to new stuff you found on the web?",1317196865

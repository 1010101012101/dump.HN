If this is something they really feel passionately about, rather than just a way to amuse themselves with angry rants, then all that energy could have been put to so much better use.<p>I guess it's easier to hate and claim to be taking the high ground than it is to actually put forth an effort to make the state of things better-which says more about them than it does W3Schools, and probably says a lot about human nature in general, really.<p>W3Schools is not without its many and varied problems, both in content and, as others have said, its own code base, but so is nearly every other tutorial or web programming site on the internet that's more than, say, a year old. The 'net is litered with old content that often can be difficult for new developers to filter out and know what's good and what's not. Just look at the volume of old, horrible PHP tutorials floating around, or even old Rails code. The main difference is that a lot of people will see W3Schools and assume it is associated with the W3, so they might take it as being a more reliable source.<p>I'm not sure how actively W3Schools is updated, but if they have a staff maintaining it and actively develop and write content for the site and they're not replacing the old with the new, then yes, that's just lazy and they <i>should</i> be doing better, but tutorial sites containing old, bad code and coding practices is certainly nothing unique to W3Schools.",1295200688

I've always been uneasy about these studies from either side of the debate because they are almost always conducted by people who have no other connection to the black community.<p>That is, white researchers who live, work, and play among their white peers are drawing conclusions about a community they (socially) know nothing about. These researchers often have few/no black friends. Have never been to a predominantly black party. Never sat down in a black hair salon or barbershop and listened to the talk of the day.<p>How we expect accurate analysis that can lead to meaningful solutions is beyond me.<p>ETA: \nPersistent poverty in the black community is the result of many things. Misplaced and legitimate distrust of white people, misguided government programs, low expectations, too high expectations, racist laws, stereotypes about black intelligence, black people's internalization of those stereotypes...<p>Anyone expecting a conclusive study that comes down on one side or the other, or that narrows the problem/solution to any one issue is living a pipe dream.",1295200670

Nice.<p>Given that the lending feature is only ONE loan for the whole lifetime of the purchase, it's more of a joke. I think people should rather write a kindlebay not kindle lending clubs.<p>Amazon is also doing this wrong -- an ebook is conceptually either lendable or not. I would say it is, so allowing the publisher to toggle this checkbox seems beyond stupid.<p>If Amazon is afraid of wide scale distribution (like this kindle lending club) perhaps they just need to define lending as something between 2 physical kindle devices done in a peer-to-peer manner.<p>That is, I have to be physically next to my friend's Kindle in order to share a book (using some adhoc wifi connection for example). Or, if I want to 'lend' to a friend 1000 miles away -- make the lending happen with a delay of a few days (for 'shipping') and even add some small ($1 ?) cost.<p>Basically they could have introduced with software all the inconvenience of actual physical book lending (proximity, distance issues) but instead they invented something new: one lending per book lifetime and publisher-defined ""lendability"".<p>Of course, the sane option would be to have all ebooks as lendable with some normal limits (say, once <i>per month</i>).",1295199774

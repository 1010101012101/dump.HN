211638,comment,211540,211540,0,0,bbgm,,,"The key is not to remember that Open Source should not be a central business model.  It can be part of a broader strategic platform.<p>To make open source work, you need to either (a) believe that opening up source is not a big competitive disadvantage, e.g. your customers will still come to you for services, consulting etc (the kind of business you can build on top of an open source platform) or (b) have enough of a community where you can go the MySQL route.  There you need to be part of the community as someone else has pointed out.",1212864584

211625,comment,209870,210433,0,0,william42,,,"HN isn't a reference work like Wikipedia or the MSDN Knowledge Base, so it's less important here.<p>But the real reason that Microsoft's URLs suck is that the MSDN Knowledge Base is an older product than Google's, built back when the web was new and people didn't realize that their URLs sucked.  And one thing that I respect Microsoft for is actually caring about reverse compatibility.<p>(Sidenote: This is why you should <i>think</i> about your URLs.  They are how your website will be presented to the world.)",1212863291

211617,comment,211294,211462,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>writing code is harder than telling people what you think they ought to do</i><p>I do both and I definitely agree. Not only is it harder, there's more responsibility. You have to make something work. If it doesn't get done, or doesn't work, that's your fault. By contrast, if you tell someone what to do and it doesn't work, you can always say ""well, they didn't do it right"". Which of course is exactly what does get said. It's a moot point, though, because there isn't really much accountability to begin with, and because people tend to blame themselves and hide failures under the rug.<p>Edit: There's also a perception gap. Writing code is a lot harder than most people think it is. Ultimately, I think that's one of the deeper reasons to make one's own product and sell it rather than be a hired code-writer.",1212861853

211614,comment,211541,211589,0,0,parenthesis,,,"I agree with your points.<p>I think what is wrong with it is that it is too twisty and curvy for something that is to be so small. A favicon should be bold, simple, clear. Like the Y on this site.",1212861615

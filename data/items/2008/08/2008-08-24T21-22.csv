The key part that I have not figured out is the motivation for enterprising individuals to start their own schools while maintaining an environment that is cheap enough to allow even the lowest of the low-income groups to send a relatively bright child to the school.",1219615144

285438,comment,285260,285427,0,0,orib,,,"Better workflow.<p>There are tons of times I want to try something locally without affecting the main repository. It hurts trying to keep uncommitted experimental changes from messing up local upstream, while still switching back to the old code to fix a bug that affects everybody. With git's local branches, rebasing, and fast branch switching, it's easy to keep your local, not-yet-ready changes in a branch, and fix bugs on master, for example.<p>Allowing other people to pull your changes directly from your repository for testing, without committing it, is also a big plus. ""Hey, I have this fix that I want to test before I commit it. Can you pull tag omg-git-is-awesome from my machine and test it to make sure I didn't mess things up?""<p>Overall, DVCS just fits better with the way I work. Note, pretty much any DVCS will give you similar advantages. Git's just nice because it feels fast, and I'm just comfortable with it. Plus, stuff like rebase and bisect are sweet.",1219615115

I've finished putting together a home page for a service I'm starting at <a href=""http://www.usabilityfeedback.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usabilityfeedback.com</a> , and would really appreciate any feedback on it. (Incidentally, if you're interested in the service, please email me and mention YC and I will take 33% off the price.)<p>For a couple years now I've been doing usability reviews for people just for fun. Then two and a half weeks ago I was laid off because the startup I was working for is nearly out of funding. I had had the idea for usabilityfeedback.com for awhile and decided to run with it in a way that would be quick to implement, enjoyable, and that could start generating cash immediately.<p>So far the response has been very positive, with other web developers I know recommending it to their clients. I'm really hoping it will do well enough that I'll be able to do it full time and have time left over to improve and add more services. Or at least stay off the streets.<p>Thanks!",1219614916

285415,comment,284618,285356,0,0,thwarted,,,"Artificial scarcity is trying to limit access to something which can not be limited.  Once bits, for any purpose, are put in the right order to do something or represent something, the cost to replicate those bits to other parties is zero.  In contrast with an automobile, even after it is designed, significant infrastructure (currently) needs to be built and exist to create another one.  What you are paying for when you purchase a car is the PROCESS that went into creating JUST that ONE car you bought.  Additional cars would not exist if the infrastructure didn't exist to create more of them (and then economies of scale come into play, making the car actually affordable).  Bits do not have that limitation.<p>Scarcity and want must exist in order to set a legitimate price.  Artificial scarcity sets a price on something that isn't actually scarce.  It is a (unfortunate?) side-effect of the market that potential buyers think that because something has a price, it must be worth having (ie scarce).  I don't think there's actually anything wrong with basing a business on this, but don't be surprised when your customers realize you've been selling them something that should have a price closer to zero because there is infinite supply.",1219613448

That doesn't mean they aren't the best that we currently have.  Just look at places where people don't have the guarantee of an education, if you want an example of what things could be like.  Tons of kids in Africa would love to have the ""crappy"" education that is on offer in the US or Europe, because it would be the beginnings of a way out of the poverty in which they live.<p>Can it be improved?  Certainly, but ""just git the dadburn gummint outta the way"" is, to put it mildly, a bit simplistic for something that even folks like Friedman more or less concede is a merit good ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merit_good"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merit_good</a> ).<p>It's easy to point out the (many) flaws in the current system, which probably wasn't that pleasant for many of us here.  More difficult is coming up with something that could take its place, provide an educated populace, and best allocate people to the educational paths that would serve them best, and of course does all this in a way that is reasonably cost effective, all with a ""clientèle"" that may very well be quite immature in terms of making important decisions.

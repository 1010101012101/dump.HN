1188817,comment,1188437,1188437,0,0,tumult,,,"Imagine the legislators running a distributed version-control system, exchanging diffs, pull requests, etc., with each contribution able to be logged and credited to an author. This whole thing is actually a merge of two branches in the health care bill source. Of course, our legislation is not run by intelligent people trying to get things done as efficiently as possible, so it's not done this way. In fact, if you can imagine the complete opposite of DVCS (or even regular monolithic VCS) that seems to be pretty close to what's going on.<p>Difficult to know who authored exactly what. Nebulous states of various parts of bills at various points in time. Opaque language designed to shift potential blame in the future if something goes wrong. Vestigial formatting rules, incomprehensible phrasing (to those who would equate law with plain English) and a high level of redundancy.<p>Question for lawyers: if law (as in legal writing) is written as a sort of code built up over time based on past rulings and with concrete (or semi-concrete) meanings in terms of what effects it's supposed to have, why do we not get any 'comments' in legislative law? For example, it makes sense for a contract between two corporations to not have 'comments' to go along with the 'legal writing code' -- you're using the contract against someone else, so it's their job to decipher what effects it will have (right?)<p>But legislation isn't supposed to be used as a competitive chokepoint between two entities, it's supposed to be something that people who are affected by it (in the case of medical insurance reform, everybody) can understand. Reading legal writing to me seems like reading source code without comments, and you just don't give source code without comments to someone asking to read your code unless you have a grudge against them.",1268480468

Movies take a significant amount of time to produce, and they spend a fair amount of time in various pre-production phases as well. As it turns out, the entertainment industry is a fairly small world, just about everybody knows what just about everybody else is doing. If nothing else, movie productions must maintain some degree of publicity in order to attract talent for the cast and crew to work on the movie itself. And in recent years anyone with a subscription to IMDB pro has access to all that information. The fact that often there are movies with highly similar themes that are released in close succession is most likely attributable to nothing more than folks copying what seem to be ""hot"" ideas of others.",1268479186

1188791,comment,1188009,1188352,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well... bear with me and I'll try not to throw a dissertation-length explanation at you :)<p>Rome in the days of Seneca and the other major Stoics was far from having a single unified religion. There was a ""state religion"" following the co-opted Greek pantheon we all learn about in school (Jupiter/Zeus at the top, etc.), but that's far from the whole story. I've got a book sitting next to me right now which just provides a survey and nutshell summaries of the important traditions and major concepts, and it runs around 300 pages; ""religion"" in the Empire was a huge tangled collection of monotheistic groups, polytheistic groups, pantheistic groups, arguably atheistic groups, and a vast cobweb of cross-pollinations between Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Jewish and Christian traditions.<p>So a short answer to one of your questions is: ""yeah, they had monotheism, but also they didn't"".<p>As to Seneca and the Stoic view: the Stoics like to toss around the word ""ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ"" (Logos). But every other philosophy and practically every mystery religion of the day <i>also</i> used the term (plus it got co-opted into Christianity early on), and though the intended meaning is similar in a lot of cases there are also crucial differences. Plus, ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ and its root ŒªŒ≠Œ≥œâ are extremely overloaded to begin with even in everyday Greek. Though you'll often see the basic translations as ""word"" or ""speak"", the original concept was ""gather"", with a further sense of ""count/enumerate"" (an artifact of this meaning in modern English is ""catalogue"": Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµŒπŒΩ/""count"" gives Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ, the list of things counted) and ""order/arrange"", and from there you can dive off not only into gathering words but also gathering thoughts, and off into much more abstract ideas such as repetition/succession of things or events.<p>So ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ can embody a huge number of concepts, but within the context of Stoicism a good approximation is of an all-pervading rational order in the universe, exemplified by the succession of events under natural law. You will find Stoic philosophers who identify this with a god or gods -- typically Jupiter/Zeus -- but it can be difficult to figure out whether they're doing that because they really believe it, or because (as was common at the time) they were simply trying to tie into or co-opt already-familiar ideas, because what they meant by ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ was something quite different from the personal, corporeal gods of the Roman state religion.<p>Ultimately, Stoicism -- if it's theistic at all -- is pantheistic, because ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ by its all-pervading nature must be everywhere and in everything. And since the ordering of things in nature follows rational, predictable principles they argued by analogy that ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ, the source of those principles, must similarly be rational. They also argued that it must (as a consequence) be deterministic; and thus Stoicism advocates acceptance of things as they happen. To the Stoic, this is the only real choice: to fight, pointlessly, to turn the course of events one way or another, or to accept and make peace with things as they are, and devote yourself to philosophy and reflection and the life of the mind. Even if you can't improve the lot of society, you can improve yourself.<p>So questions of ""fairness"" don't really come into it; what Seneca's trying to get at is not that lifetimes have been allotted by some intelligence to serve some purpose, but that so many people waste so much of their lives on a fight they cannot possibly win and end up neglecting the one thing they can genuinely do to improve themselves and find contentment.",1268478102

Fitness-\nDamn Right. Several people have given the reason. and its as simple as putting half and hour, 5 days a week in moving your body. Keeps you physically fit and mentally <i>robust</i>. At times I have realized that my mental activeness is directly proportion to the exercise and my fitness level.<p>2. Family and Friends-\nYes, they are the support mechanism. Talking to them and taking some time out to talk to one of your closest friends(friend/mom/wife) will help you shift your focus from your business into <i>people</i> that matter to you. Believe it or not at some point you will realize that <i>relationships</i> and <i>people</i> matter the most and investing in them is a worthwhile guaranteed win.<p>3. Fun-\nThe part would be just having fun, doing something that you love. The best part is you can easily fit it into your daily schedules. Just after your office hours, give 30 minutes unwinding yourself by doing a hobby that you love (e.g. reading a book, writing the journal, playing that guitar, singing songs, playing basketball). Life is short and ultimately everyone makes money so that they could have fun or do what they love, why not do it everyday. It helps you completely detach yourself from your day at office. Fun everyday, keeps stress away.",1435294790

9782575,comment,9778285,9781552,0,0,hamburglar,,,"I just tried it on a 35MB log file and it gave me an alert that said it was gonna be sluggish, then took about 20s to actually open the file I requested (I could navigate to other tabs in the meantime but there was no indication that anything was happening), and then once the file appeared, it took another 20s to become responsive.  Searching for a string which appeared in the second line of the file took over 30s, probably because it was searching the entire file to highlight all matches, and all the while, it was completely unresponsive.  Then when I tried to close the file, the entire editor hung and eventually gave me a &quot;this tab is not responding&quot; dialog.  I clicked &quot;wait&quot; and it took another 10s and the window finally closed.<p>All in all I&#x27;d say the experience editing large files still completely sucks compared to every other editor I use.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still love and use Atom, but they really need to come up with a solution to this problem, because it&#x27;s just ridiculous.  The fact that I have to occasionally leave my text editor to edit certain text files is a huge black eye that many people won&#x27;t put up with, and which I will eventually get tired of putting up with if they don&#x27;t do something about it soon.<p>One thing I think they could do is take advantage of the fact that when you are editing a file that large, you don&#x27;t expect to have a particularly good experience with the scrollbar.  I don&#x27;t open a file with 10 million lines and grab the scrollbar to get to the spot I&#x27;m looking for; it&#x27;s just not practical.  Over a certain size, they really don&#x27;t need to have the entire buffer in memory at once, and maybe they don&#x27;t even need a usable scrollbar so much as they need good relative navigation and search.  It would be perfectly reasonable in my opinion to have a &quot;large file mode&quot; for the editor window that has subtly different behavior that makes it not so ridiculously heavy.",1435294726

9782558,comment,9779712,9780826,0,0,rwallace,,,"Yes, it logically follows from simple economic principles: if you&#x27;re competing with other companies for good candidates (which you are), your hit rate will go up if you look for signals that your competitors ignore or reject, because that gives you access to a pool that hasn&#x27;t already been picked clean. So if most companies prefer candidates who have a college degree, look for candidates who haven&#x27;t. If most companies are looking for experience in some mainstream language, look for candidates who have experience in something quirky and unusual. If most companies discriminate against candidates outside the age range of 20 to 39, look for candidates outside that age range.<p>I&#x27;ll add a note that it&#x27;s not necessary for every company to do something different. It&#x27;s perfectly okay for your company to copy the way this one did things. It&#x27;s perfectly okay for five or ten companies to do that.

9782550,comment,9778661,9782041,0,0,zaroth,,,"I guess it depends on what you mean by &quot;predictions that the ACA would be crippled&quot;. Certainly states which chose not to setup their own exchanges and not to tax businesses in order to subsidize healthcare would have much less universal healthcare. Likewise, states that chose to setup their own exchanges and provide subsidies through taxation would see much more universal healthcare. Citizens would continue to benefit from freedom of movement between states in the union, and at least we could sleep at night knowing the judiciary is marginally beholden to the laws of the land as they are actually written.<p>We&#x27;re talking about the Solicitor General of Indiana who filed an amicus brief in support of the petitioners [1] -- these are states whose representatives decided they did not want the subsidies, now having those subsidies forced upon them by an outright red-lining of the law of the land under a novel &quot;broader context theory&quot;. Personally, that&#x27;s terrifying to me. The amicus brief is quite well written and summarizes the counter-argument quite well if you&#x27;re interested in actually hearing a reasonable argument of both sides (rather than the typical political commentary, which is <i>irrelevant</i> to the actual case at hand)<p>Next perhaps we&#x27;ll be talking about the &quot;broader context&quot; of the CFAA when the Feds want to expand the scope of hacking charges, or perhaps the &quot;broader context&quot; of mandatory sentencing minimums. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a &quot;broader context&quot; to go along with just about any ideological ax that may presently need grinding, regardless of the ideological slant of the ax grinder.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/BriefsV4/14-114_amicus_pet_%20Indiana.authcheckdam.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supr...</a>",1435294008

(Or more often from a previous application, sometimes with info about the previous company left in!)  A cover letter that talks about something exciting you&#x27;ve done recently, and ideally how it might be related to the job, or even just how it demonstrates skills you&#x27;ll use in the job (and describes exactly how), is <i>awesome</i> in comparison.  A letter like that would absolutely get you an interview with me, almost regardless of experience.  One of our current co-op students actually had almost no programming experience on paper; he had actually switched out of a theatre degree iirc.  But his cover letter was awesome (the theatre degree probably not being coincidental).  Got him the interview, which got him the job, and I haven&#x27;t regretted it.

9782536,comment,9777485,9777485,0,0,pron,,,"A few comments:<p>1. This debate is not (or no longer) binary. There is a whole spectrum of static typing richness, from dynamic typing to well beyond Idris. The debate, then, is not whether we should be at any of the extreme, but where along the spectrum (including, maybe, the extremes). The interesting question to pose to proponents of very rich type systems, then, is &quot;should we always use the richest type system possible?&quot;, and if not, why not? The whole debate -- which, again, is not binary -- hides in two of the questions the author lists in the end: &quot;How easy can it be made to program in a language... ?&quot; Nobody argues that the richer the type system the more properties can be proven (except for one major caveat I mention in item 3). The debate isn&#x27;t about what character strings containing programs can be rejected or accepted. Programming language design is 5% theory and 100% psychology. What string the compiler accepts is a question for PL theorists. What language is &quot;better&quot; is a question that is 100% psychological, and has absolutely nothing to do with one theory or another. It&#x27;s a question PL researchers are simply not qualified to answer (Also, even before psychology, it may well be that moving from one point along the spectrum towards richer typing has a cost -- simple, economic cost in development time or in performance -- that is higher than the benefit of extra correctness. Most programs need to be correct only up to a point. Why should they pay for a type system that will make them more correct than they need to be?)<p>2. The question, &quot;How close can we bring those test suites to the unattainable ideal of never accepting a broken program?&quot; directed at dynamic typing can also be directed at static typing. True, a statically typed language may reject <i>all</i> programs, but practical ones will accept broken ones <i>as well</i> as reject correct ones, simply because there are properties the type system won&#x27;t verify.<p>3. Testing isn&#x27;t the only way to verify dynamically typed programs -- or <i>any</i> program along the typing-spectrum -- for properties that aren&#x27;t enforced by its type system. There are quite good formal verification methods that don&#x27;t rely on types. True, the author uses a confusing, self-referential (undecidable? :)) definition for types: &quot;a type is a label used by a type system to prove some property of the program&#x27;s behavior&quot; that is hard to argue with (&quot;a type is something the type system uses&quot;), but there are &quot;property annotations&quot; in the form of pre- and post-conditions used by verifiers, that aren&#x27;t normally regarded as types (they don&#x27;t form a particularly nice algebra), and may be used at any point along the spectrum to prove properties beyond the reach of the particular type system. The implication that types are the  <i>only</i> way to prove correctness is wrong.",1435293819

I paid ~$14,000 up front as Canadians didn&#x27;t qualify for the tuition deferment (an eminently reasonable restriction, work visas are far from a sure thing). I had degrees in non-cs STEM fields and CS coursework which allowed me to fit into a TN visa category, and I&#x27;m currently happily employed in SF.<p>I&#x27;m disappointed in App Academy for this omission - they should be better than this.<p>That said, some perspective:<p>They have placed 400(?) people in the SF tech market through this tuition deferment scheme. Many of those hundreds didn&#x27;t have the $10k-$18k up front needed for a bootcamp. Many of those people, myself included, consider attending App Academy a life-changing event. Easily the single most useful stretch of three months I&#x27;ve spent over the course of my twenties.<p>Their system of tuition deferment + rent free living on the floor in SOMA was unprecedented and a large gamble on their part. I&#x27;m very likely over-reacting given my strong feelings of gratitude to the school, but there&#x27;s an under-current of entitlement in these posts I find objectionable.<p>They should have made certain that their complete tuition policy was clear, accurate, and very visible. That said, the harm you incurred was learning some minimal amount of ruby and and engaging in some screen shares. These are both skills that will be useful in any further interaction you have with web development, either bootcamp applications or job interviews. Respectfully, you have a long road ahead of you and much more potential unfairness.<p>Your experience with them does tarnish my view of App Academy slightly.

You can&#x27;t write a kernel in Swift, nor target embedded platforms, nor write a library that could be called from other languages like Ruby or Python (at least, without bringing in the whole runtime as well). It&#x27;s closer to the space of Go, a more systems-y application language.<p>Furthermore, open source Swift does not mean you will be able to use the whole ecosystem on other platforms. I highly doubt that Apple will port Cocoa/Cocoa Touch to other platforms; so Swift on other platforms will likely only be viable for back-end code.<p>Objective-C has been open source for years, and until the introduction of Swift was the dominant language of choice for writing code on one of the most popular smartphone platforms, but Apple canned cross-platform OpenStep when they bought NeXT, and Objective-C has never made serious inroads on other platforms (I know exactly one person who writes production, server-side code in Objective-C on Linux).<p>So, I could see Swift becoming popular for writing backends for iPhone applications, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it will make serious inroads in other spaces, unless Apple makes a dramatic change in strategy and starts shipping their UI libraries on other platforms as well.",1435292646

Some people can get as much as 17 miles with UHF radios, but those operate in the 400Mhz range, which, I would assume, would be very busy with all the radio traffic from fire fighters and other first responders around that area right now.<p>Of course it could be a fully autonomous system, which makes it all the more dangerous.<p>Overall, if I had to guess, I would say this is just bad reporting on LA times part. The drone was probably well over 1,000 feet in the air, but more than likely the hight reported was from sea level, not ground level.",1435292075

The $5k deposit was a recent change and not yet mentioned on the main site either.<p>They have a lot of documentation that they&#x27;re slowly bringing up to date.  The curriculum is constantly in flux and being improved.  The people who work on all of this are the TAs so they&#x27;re spread a bit thin.  It&#x27;s not that they aren&#x27;t being transparent - they&#x27;ve always been 100% honest with me and beyond fair - they&#x27;re just overworked.  I made lots of pull requests during my cohort to update documentation which they&#x27;re really good about accepting and seemed to appreciate the help.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve seen though, this $18k up-front probably has more to do with the realities of the marketplace for junior devs right now.  It seems to be slowing a lot and people sans-degree or work experience take a lot longer to find jobs.  There&#x27;s a glut of junior devs sans-experience in the market and many companies don&#x27;t know to filter for AppAcademy students yet.  The size of their cohorts also seem to be growing quickly - probably ahead of how quickly they can hire TAs and fit people in the office.<p>Full Disclosure:  I&#x27;m a recent AppAcademy grad.

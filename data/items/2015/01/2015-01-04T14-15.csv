This also reflects in chipset documentation, which sometimes comes with pages and pages of &quot;write X to register Y&quot;, and not much more.<p>The value is that the higher level structure is more easily visible when you know what is code and what is data (which is the main issue with disassembly), and the ability to quickly see that you haven&#x27;t missed extra code that is executed in some sneaky place because everything in the output is accounted for somehow.<p>The options we have with coreboot are to have 8MB of unaccounted stuff, or 500KB of unaccounted stuff. The latter can be reverse engineered more easily, since the scope is known, and the complexity is a magnitude smaller (no code decompressing other code, jumping into it, ...). That was actually done for sandybridge. We even built tools to simplify reverse engineering (www.serialice.com)<p>As for the funnily named BDSM register: <a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/4th-gen-core-family-mobile-u-y-processor-lines-vol-2-datasheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/...</a> calls it &quot;Base Data of Stolen Memory&quot;. Essentially, both GPU and ME get assigned some system memory to work in, and that register contains the first address that isn&#x27;t available to the CPU due to this arrangement.<p>That register itself is harmless. In older Intel chipsets, it was possible for the host CPU to get a peek into the ME&#x27;s memory by messing with that register, which was used for some ME analysis in 2012 or 2013. Unfortunately they plugged that hole, and that register&#x27;s role is more of the informative kind.",1420380675

Allow relays to apply individual hidden service (HS) blacklists: HS addresses are not necessarily public, can require authentication to connect to, and are trivial to generate (these are all extremely important properties for anonymous publishing in general). So these CP sites will go even more &quot;dark&quot; once the relay blacklists start being an annoyance. Not to mention that relay blacklists open up an obvious DoS opportunity.<p>2. Require credentials for HSes and revoke them if they are discovered to be serving CP: There is no apparent way to make identity creation costly in an anonymous world where we must be able to support relatively poor users (e.g. without much CPU, memory, bandwidth, money).<p>3. Allow authorities to selectively deanonymize certain users or service: There is no way this is going to work in a world where nobody agrees on who the authorities are or what constitutes a legitimate request.<p>The Tor Project is doing one thing about this problem that is consistent with their mission. They are making accessible safe but useful information about the world of hidden services. In fact, they have a whole funded project on it <<a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorR>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/S...</a>. Note that this project includes such useful things as improved crawling support, global HS statistics, and discovering public .onion addresses.",1420380020

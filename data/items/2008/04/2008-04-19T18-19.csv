168088,comment,168083,168083,0,0,maurycy,,,"Interesting quote, I think:<p>Google sells more advertising than any company in the world. This year Morgan Stanley estimates Google’s total advertising revenue will be $21.9 billion. Excluding the payments it makes to companies that display its ads, Google’s total ad revenue will be $15.7 billion.<p>Time Warner, the largest media company in the world, earned $8.8 billion in advertising revenue last year. Viacom had $4.7 billion in ad revenue last year. I’m still working through the numbers at the other big conglomerates, but it seems clear that none of them sold more than $16 billion in advertising.",1208629866

-natural disasters

-political rallies

168082,comment,166905,166991,0,0,pauek,,,"My guess is that the brain is trying new combinations, so that if you hit a new idea during the day, it will get reinforced (you get ""excited""). So the brain ""shuffles"" stuff during the night (dreams) and during the day selects. It is like evolutionary modification of behavior, in a way.<p>But to do it, you have to reinforce a little the nonsensical stuff for a while (and at speed). This semi-conscious state in which there are inconsistencies is ""pre""-dream, in which almost everything is quite nonsensical, but it kind of ""makes sense"", so it gets reinforced a bit. The interesting thing is that this is done in parallel, so what you remember about a dream is like a small part of what your cortex was ""thinking"", a massive recombination of ideas.<p>Well, I could go on and on with my speculations... ;)",1208629480

If someone appears as your friend but isn't, you can reject that friend to break the link.<p>The idea here is that unregistered users would have to check out the site to see who their friends are and protect their reputation.  And if some of them aren't friends, they would need to register to break those friendship links.<p>One might imagine that this would result in more registered users than bidirectional friendship links.",1208629286

VMWare Workstation was their first product, and they only got into server virtualization and enterprise solutions after the dot-com recovery, when folks realized ""Hey, our servers are sitting idle most of the time, let's put a bunch of additional virtual servers on it.""<p>They've followed the path of many, many other successful disruptive innovations.  They come out with something that's innovative & technically hard, release it as a low-margin consumer product, and then gradually move up-margin into enterprise systems as their product gets better & more widely known.",1208628909
168077,comment,168014,168014,0,0,as,,,"I really like this idea, but one problem I see is in building a user base. What are the chances there's going to be someone local to respond the first time a user tries your service? It helps that once they've added you to their friend's list, that'll remind them to try again every once in awhile, but needing them to have the patience to try several times would seem to dampen user acquisition.<p>It'll be neat when it has a large following, but kind of useless in the beginning.",1208628691

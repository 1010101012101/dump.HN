8382010,comment,8381493,8381990,4,0,blumkvist,,,"Yeah, I&#x27;m just cranky before my coffee. It&#x27;s my bad.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of total spend. Advertising, and marketing in general is about a lot of tests. The best way to approach it is to read a lot of material beforehand. Then map out the outcomes you want out of the advertising. Figure out what your KPIs are, set goals for those KPIs based on what you&#x27;ve read. Then set a daily budget according to your goals. And start running tests. After a month you can look at your results and see what worked, what didn&#x27;t and you can start thinking why those things happened or what didn&#x27;t happen.<p>The budget is  something specific for every individual business. You can&#x27;t really say, you need $X to get started. It is not an easy process. That&#x27;s why I sometimes overreact to statements like OP&#x27;s. Advertising is not something you can do in 15 minutes before bed. You need to educate yourself, be dedicated and persistent to make it work continuesly.<p>If you want to make it work, I suggest Neil Petel&#x27;s quicksprout university for a very, very basic introduction.<p><a href=""http://www.quicksprout.com/university/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quicksprout.com/university/</a>",1411977514
8382009,comment,8381253,8381253,3,0,adrianhoward,,,"<i>&quot;Too often some view testing as primarily a function of large projects, mature products, or big companies. One of the most critical hires a growing team can make is that first testing leader&quot;</i><p>To be honest — I don&#x27;t see that mistake much any more. Indeed I&#x27;m generally much more upbeat about the current state of testing that the author of this article seems to be.<p>The thing that strikes me most about testing is how much the profession and practice has changed over the last twenty years.  All for the better.<p>In the 90&#x27;s and early 00&#x27;s it was very much as the article says. Seen as something for larger organisations only. Generally something done by a separate person or team alone. Almost never something integrated with ongoing development work (those ghastly integration sessions that took weeks and months… shudder…). Almost never something that developers were involved with themselves — which led to some god awful code coming out the end of the sausage machine. Testers were generally seen as folk who couldn&#x27;t hack programming. And there were an awful lot of folk that I encountered with a testing job title in those years who were bloody awful at their job — who were basically human automated tests running through checklists and providing relatively little value to the organisation.<p>These days every language has half a dozen test frameworks, supporting different styles of automated testing. Knowledge of testing at some level is <i>expected</i> of developers.. Anybody but the rankest newbie should be able to discuss it — even then I&#x27;d be pretty shocked if even the freshest of faces didn&#x27;t at least have an opinion and knowledge on the topic. Almost every codebase that I interact with will have some kind of automated test suite. Often really excellent ones. Testing is integrated into the development process rather than being a separate phase. Because of this a huge number of the dumb errors that the checklist-style tester had to catch are now caught by machines. Which has freed up the professional tester to spend their efforts on the hard problems. You get so much more value out of testers these days because they&#x27;re spending their time coming up with evil edge cases, isolating those bastard intermittent issues, or feeding back a metric shed load of issues from sessions of exploratory testing. Stuff they never had the time to do when they were dealing with the errors that the devs should have caught themselves.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I still encounter teams that really, really need a specialist tester but don&#x27;t realise it. I still encounter teams that could be way, way better at automated testing than they could be and their shipping problems show it. The testing profession is currently having to deal with the idiocy that is ISO (see <a href=""http://commonsensetesting.org/stop29119/OpenLetter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commonsensetesting.org/stop29119/OpenLetter/</a>).<p>Life&#x27;s not perfect.<p>But compared to 20 years ago — the state of testing is good!",1411977353

Few clients ever reached L3, and none ever reached L4 or L5.<p>The problem was, our price tag was derived from the cost of storing, reporting on, and executing workflow around L4 and L5... we were expensive. This was fine from the perspective of the sales process because everyone <i>wants</i> to reach L5 and so buys into it. But in reality it turned out that once clients had mastered L2, the incremental value received from the weight of extra process required to make L3+ valueable to them just never added up.<p>We sold ourselves as the only company offering L5 reporting, and whilst clients were aspirational they only ever had the need for L2 or L3 reporting. We were giving them L2 reporting for the price of an L5 system.<p>Reading the comments here, and I personally have not used Mixpanel for a while now, I suspect that you guys are on the same path we were: Selling the complexity and the capability of a Formula 1 car, when most people just want a Volvo.<p>It&#x27;s not even the first time I&#x27;ve seen this cycle repeat itself.

8381957,comment,8381480,8381480,0,0,Animats,,,"That&#x27;s not an unreasonable approach. When I came up with the original approach to congestion control in TCP 30 years ago (see Internet RFCs 896 and 970), TCP behavior under load was so awful that connections would stall out and fail.  The ad-hoc solutions we put in back then at least made TCP well behaved under load.<p>In the early days of TCP/IP, it was clear that there was no known solution to congestion in the middle of a big datagram network. There still isn&#x27;t. Out near the edges, we can use fair queuing, which I invented and named, and which is offered in most Cisco routers for links below Ethernet speeds. We still don&#x27;t know what to do in the middle of the network. &quot;Random Early Drop&quot; is an ugly hack, but it&#x27;s what we have in the big routers. What saved us for years is that fiber backbones had so much more bandwidth than the last mile consumer connections that the congestion stayed near the ends.  Then came streaming HD video.<p>The treatment of congestion went off in a different direction than I&#x27;d expected.  Originally, ICMP Source Quench messages were used for congestion control. Routers were expected to tell endpoints when to slow down. But they weren&#x27;t implemented in Berkeley&#x27;s networking stack, and gradually were phased out.  (They would have been a denial of service attack vector, anyway.)  Instead, congestion was inferred from packet loss. Even worse, congestion is inferred from not having a packet acknowledged, so you don&#x27;t know which direction is congested. That&#x27;s not a particularly good approach, but it&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve got.<p>I originally took the position that, as an endpoint, you were entitled to one packet in flight. That is, the network should be provisioned so that every connection can have one packet in transit without packet loss.  If you have that much capacity, and you have fair queuing in routers, you only lose packets if you have more than one in flight.  You&#x27;re thus competing with yourself for bandwidth, and an &quot;increase slowly, back off big on packet loss&quot; strategy works fine.<p>In a world with Random Early Drop, not enough fair queuing, and big FIFO buffers (someone called this &quot;bufferbloat&quot;), you get both packet loss and excessive transit time.  It&#x27;s hard for the endpoints to adapt to that no matter what they do.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using a smarter algorithm to calculate optimal window sizes and retransmission times.  As long as it evaluates how well it&#x27;s doing and feeds that back into the control algorithm in a rational way, that&#x27;s fine.  Today, you could probably afford to run machine learning algorithms in routers.  So go for it!<p>If you&#x27;re going to do that, it&#x27;s a good time to fix delayed ACK as well.  As is well known, the interaction between delayed ACKs and the Nagle algorithm is awful.  This is a historical accident; I implemented one, the Berkeley guys implemented the other, and by the time I found out I was out of networking and involved with a small startup called Autodesk. So that never got fixed.  Here&#x27;s how to think about that.  A delayed ACK is a bet.  You&#x27;re betting that there will be a reply, upon with an ACK can be piggybacked, before the fixed timer runs out. If the fixed timer runs out, and you have to send an ACK as a separate message, you lost the bet.  Current TCP implementations will happily lose that bet forever without turning off the ACK delay. That&#x27;s just wrong.<p>The right answer is to track wins and losses on delayed and non-delayed ACKs. Don&#x27;t turn on ACK delay unless you&#x27;re sending a lot of non-delayed ACKs closely followed by packets on which the ACK could have been piggybacked.  Turn it off when a delayed ACK has to be sent.<p>I should have pushed for this in the 1980s.<p>John Nagle",1411975371

Examples of too much social interaction leading to suicides: prison suicides, overworked stressed out students, suicides due to too much debt or career failure, individuals, usually women, left alone to take care of too many children alone without support, and altruistic suicides such as when elderly go into the wilderness to free up resources, or soldiers jumping on grenades. It&#x27;s not just loneliness that kills. You have to plan ahead and manage your interaction such that you don&#x27;t leave yourself without anyone, and have a support network and realistic expectations in life.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_(book)#Types_of_suicide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_(book)#Types_of_suicide</a>",1411975025

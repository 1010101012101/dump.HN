For a religious person I doubt there&#x27;s anything that could make attitudes about morality more accessible, and accessibility is almost the whole story for behavior.<p>I think if a video game loading screen told you &quot;Piracy is WRONG!&quot; it would be ineffective in GTA, neutral in Civilization, and effective about half the time in Mass Effect.<p>Likewise, if gonzo porn had interstitials about how copying is wrong, I doubt anyone would be moved by it, but if political feminist porn had little interludes where the director said she didn&#x27;t make much off her work and would rather you support her, it would almost certainly be effective.<p>People who are religious will happily do a whole number of viciously amoral things, like go to war, kill people, or make others feel subhuman for their gender or sex preferences.

We don&#x27;t, so now not only will we take your money, we&#x27;ll insult your intelligence with this passive aggressive message.&quot;  I assumed you&#x27;re proposing this message pops out as the second phase of the current scenario.

Thanks for the feedback :)<p>re: instantiating controllers - services definitely help, but you still have to design and expose APIs to manage the lifecycle of variables from the controllers, and often times (at least for me), there are a lot of cross-concerns and it becomes impractical to have services to deal with each permutation of concern groups (this is especially a problem in more exploratory projects). I should note that in the cases where maintainability suffers the most, I have upwards of 5 core model entities and a dozen other auxiliary ones being manipulated in a single page.<p>Also, when things need to persist across route changes, then you&#x27;re pretty much stuck to polluting $rootScope (or worse, $cookie)<p>re: &quot;Bi-directional data binding should never get you into a loop if you take care to only use the APIs in ngModelController&quot;<p>Yes, they <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i>, but under some unexplainable circumstances they do, even when I&#x27;m explicitly avoiding all the other undocumented traps (e.g. isolated scope interop, etc).

I have had many landlords in the past when I was renting and at least 2 of them were shady and tried to take a portion out of my deposit with false claims that I did something wrong. One specific case, the landlord claimed that renters are supposed to pay for carpet cleaning when leaving. We had nothing of that in the contract. I pointed it out and her response &quot;thats the state law&quot; and she forwarded me a PDF of the state law for landlord/tenants. Guess what, I actually found a section in that same PDF that clearly said that tenants are not responsible for usual wear and tear cleaning unless agreed in the contract.<p>Overall, I think you are missing the point of why to own vs rent.

How is that not amazing?</i><p>C and even C++ run in far more places than Javascript does or ever will. People using other languages won&#x27;t be interested in or able to use your library written in Javascript.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t particularly care about writing code that runs on every device ever. I want to write code to solve problems, and for a large set of problems Javascript inside a web browser is fairly useless. Javascript is great if your economic model is getting as many users as possible and then getting aquhired before you run out of capital. This is the case for a lot of people on HN, even if they don&#x27;t realise it. However I&#x27;m a small time developer, not in SV, who programs because I enjoy solving problems and helping people, not to get rich. I&#x27;m only really interested in whether $(number of people who can run the code) * $(how much they can pay) > $(my cost of living) so that I can afford to eat. It means I don&#x27;t care so long as the platform/language I choose has enough users to pay my bills, it doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% of people. I realise that the industry giants at Google or Mozilla don&#x27;t really care about people like me (&#x27;life style business&#x27; is usually a term of derision on HN). In a world of web based operating systems that only run web apps I would end up stacking shelves in the supermarket or on the dole because I dislike that technology stack enough that I can&#x27;t be productive in it. That is why sometimes I bitch about Javascript.",1383058441

You can create a simple HTML file, run it strait from the browser, and voil, you have a program.<p>Javascripts flexibility is why you see emulators, 3D games and simulations, everything written in Javascript.  Every language compiles to Javascript, and you can edit code live in Javascript, having it render directly into the browser, without running a server, REPL, etc...<p>The main advantage of Javascript though is the freedom it gives to developers - you can be productive in it quickly, individual developers can get alot done with it in a short time, and it enables web apps to be created quickly.<p>Look at something like Firefox OS, how easy it is to script and develop for, and then you&#x27;ll understand why JS is great.",1383057464

The military regime got entangled with fights against the syndicates (which were a strong political force back then, and are mostly toothless now, with the exception of the truck-transport syndicate), and dismantling the national industries was used as a resource to weaken them. Also, they systematically killed and &quot;disappeared&quot; basically anyone who got into politics that didn&#x27;t agreed with hem. So they destroyed both the economical and the political basis of the country. The people who took over after them came from what survived their culling: most of the people who could have grown with a different point of view were dead. In that light it isn&#x27;t that surprising that Menem&#x27;s government in the 90&#x27;s followed a similar policy of dismantling the local industry. Under the pretense of amassing funds to fight inflation, he basically sold all what remained of the national industries, creating a nice but unsustainable period of wealth. Following that, De la Rua&#x27;s government basically did nothing to address the issues, and that&#x27;s how we got to the 2001 crisis.<p>This is obviously not a complete explanation, but it works as a highlight of some of the structural causes of Argentina&#x27;s situation-",1383056661

They could also beam lasers at us although I image it would be awfully wide by the time it got here.<p>Also, so as long is the energy to ship it is less than the energy to create it by fusion, it would be economical to ship elements heavier than iron. But that would mean annoyingly slow speeds.<p>The really annoying thing is that by adding trillions of people to the universe, we apparently won&#x27;t really improve the rate of idea creation. I really hope I&#x27;m missing something on this.",1383055222

I personally prefer dynamically typed languages as I&#x27;ve found that with a combination of discipline and unit-tests (which, IMHO, you should have anyway) I never really miss the static type-checker. But I understand those people who prefer static typing very well.",1383055221

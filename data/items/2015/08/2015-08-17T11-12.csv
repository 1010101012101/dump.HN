And most people will answer healthy --because that is their idealized answer but in reality it&#x27;s too much work for many people so they eat unhealthy food fully understanding the consequences.<p>I think you&#x27;ve hit on a good point, and following your analogy, most of us are just too damned lazy or apathetic to get worked up about it (bad food or bad government). It&#x27;s easier and cheaper to buy and consume unhealthy food, just as it&#x27;s easier and (mentally) cheaper to just pretend everything is fine with the world the way it is. Sure, we&#x27;re going to get fat and die of a heart attack at 50, and sure, we&#x27;re going to steadily lose our privacy and the ability to exercise our rights; but in the here and now, we&#x27;re living in blissful ignorance and it feels just good enough to not bother changing things.

For example, various subsystems and components have hot-spares available, so that even outright component failures will not cause downtime. Many components are then hot-swappable, even those that might not ordinarily be in other architectures, such as processors and main memory. No interruption to OS or application-level services is expected by hot-swapping such hardware. Across the useful life of the mainframe, most repairs and maintenance would be carried out without ever shutting it down.<p>I understand the platform also has extensive internal integrity checking built in, a potentially important factor for various types of jobs. Its auditing service is capable of detecting unusual conditions in various subsystems or jobs (&quot;I&#x27;ve just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit&quot;), automatically retrying instructions on the processor if they executed anomalously. If the fault continues, the suspect processor is routed-around with no interruption to OS or applications, the job is resumed from last checkpoint on another processor, and the system phones home to IBM to log a service call. This monitoring is not being performed by processes running in userland or by the kernel, but is in fact baked into the hardware/firmware platform.<p>Furthermore, the systems can be configured with a variety of specialty offload processors or subsystems for tasks like encryption, key management, compression, and even logging -- which again might not be so commonly found on-board of some commodity servers.<p>(And, of course, even if you could put together an analogous solution with commodity kit, it&#x27;s IBM! For the sorts of companies looking at a mainframe in 2015, having the IBM name on the SLA has got to be a pretty big part of the equation, right?)<p>Moreover, if you proposed to build and manage these sorts of capabilities from commodity x86 kit, I imagine IBM would claim that they&#x27;d have the lower TCO.",1439810209

The NYT article prominently features anecdotes describing shockingly callous management practices, including people being treated without empathy while enduring family tragedies and serious health problems. The article doesn’t describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day. But if you know of any stories like those reported, I want you to escalate to HR. You can also email me directly at [edited]@amazon.com. Even if it&#x27;s rare or isolated, our tolerance for any such lack of empathy needs to be zero.<p>The article goes further than reporting isolated anecdotes. It claims that our intentional approach is to create a soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard. Again, I don’t recognize this Amazon and I very much hope you don’t, either. More broadly, I don&#x27;t think any company adopting the approach portrayed could survive, much less thrive, in today’s highly competitive tech hiring market. The people we hire here are the best of the best. You are recruited every day by other world-class companies, and you can work anywhere you want.<p>I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company.<p>But hopefully, you don&#x27;t recognize the company described. Hopefully, you’re having fun working with a bunch of brilliant teammates, helping invent the future, and laughing along the way.<p>Thank you,<p>Jeff",1439809988

This is most unfortunate, but it&#x27;s no reason to screw over the consumer and not give them something they want simply because other people get paid money for it.",1439809656

The way that Smalltalk is typically implemented (VM/OS) solves some very tricky problems <i>that almost nobody has.</i><p>Taking for example the main solution that it features: allowing for portability by running everything inside of a VM. This is an incredibly smart idea, however, it results in apps that don&#x27;t &#x27;glue&#x27; well with the actual OS. Furthermore, even the worst-case language for portability, C, does a pretty damned good job at being portable if the developer is disciplined.<p>On the fly editing? Awesome idea, really smart. Just don&#x27;t go anywhere near my production servers with live editing.<p>That&#x27;s what Smalltalk is to me: a bag of really smart ideas that nobody ever asked for in the first place. Really, ObjC is what Smalltalk could have been had the word &quot;no&quot; been used more frequently. It&#x27;s a good example of what happens if someone doesn&#x27;t realize that &quot;less is more.&quot;",1439809314

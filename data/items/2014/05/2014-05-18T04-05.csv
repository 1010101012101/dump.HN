Modern Architectures have decoders to translate the assembly into micro-ops which are then stored into a cache (beyond the L1 cache) and then computed.<p>Heck, the entire concept of Intel&#x27;s &quot;Hyperthreading&quot; kills any pipeline determinism you would hope to achieve.<p>Consider your typical ARM read-modify stall: add r1, r2 / add r1, r3. A stall needs to be inserted into the pipeline because r1&#x27;s value will change.<p>In contrast, the typical Out-of-Order (OoO) x86 computer (Steamroller, Ivy Bridge, and Bay Trail) will attempt to look at future instructions to execute during the pipeline stall. In the case of Hyperthreaded CPUs (Intel i7, i3, older Atoms), Intel will grab instructions from _another thread_ to execute while the stall is undergoing.<p>And worse yet, as Intel and AMD upgrade their systems, sometimes there are massive architectural differences which cause regressions in some code. The infamous AMD Bulldozer (2011 chip) regressed in FPU and Vectorized code for instance, while AMD tried to up the core count and improve integer performance.<p>If you really want to step into this arena, just use Agner Fog&#x27;s optimization manual.<p><a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf</a><p>But... it isn&#x27;t as simple as ARM because x86 CPUs are far more complicated. Out-of-order processors just kill any determinism you have.... let alone hyperthreading or the other tricks these bigger CPUs do.",1400388909

7762213,comment,7761826,7762193,4,0,mjb,,,"> I wish there was a little bit more color around what &quot;availability&quot; really means.<p>The definitions used by Gilbert and Lynch in their CAP proof requires availability for updates at all nodes. Other proofs use availability for updates (or consistent reads) at a msjority of nodes.<p>> Yes some data stores are offering higher availability, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are immune to node failure.<p>All theoretical models like this are always susceptible to real-world implementation limitations. Still, it&#x27;s very useful to think about these theoretical models, because they tell us what we could achieve with an ideal implementation. Knowing that allows us to chose implementation techniques and approaches suitable to the problem, and to not waste time on trying to implement the impossible. Just because something is possible doesn&#x27;t mean that it can be, or has been, practically implemented. If something is impossible, though, we know we shouldn&#x27;t spend time trying to do it.<p>>  Even for a &quot;CP&quot; system, latencies can go up, and with enough node failures, partial unavailability and data loss can occur.<p>Of course. These models are actually pretty silent on durability, which is frequently seen as a seperate matter, or a limiting case of availability, depending on the area of research. Durability is really practically important, but this isn&#x27;t really the area of research that addresses it.<p>Partial unavailability because of theoretical limitations and partial unavailability because of implementation limitations are different things. We can improve on the latter, and insist our software vendors do the same, but the former we just need to work around.<p>> In theory, a strongly consistent system could have a failover that is so small that it is, from a user pov, always available.<p>The definition of consistency and availability doesn&#x27;t allow you to &quot;fail over&quot;. Completely ignoring availability, there are two cases of failover: one where the system still appears to be consistent (using one of the strong consistency models described here), and one where the system becomes eventually consistent. The various proofs (such as Gilbert and Lynch&#x27;s CAP proof) imply that you can&#x27;t &quot;fail over&quot; and keep consistency in the case where some nodes are uncontactable. The definition of &quot;some nodes&quot; depends on the exact proof, but there is no way to fail over into a minority partition and keep consistency. It&#x27;s not possible.<p>On the other hand, there are loads of practical and useful ways to fail over into a minority partition that still gives useful eventual consistency semantics. It all depends what you need.",1400388514

I think ours are... maybe two or three? We&#x27;ve done a lot of work to get the reimage time down, and Win7 (WIMs) have made this really nice.<p>If this is something that smells of a bigger problem (or has been seen elsewhere) then I push for them to get the user a wholly new machine, capturing the old one for analysis. If the user is given an upgraded machine, then there is usually little resistance, even with the downtime that&#x27;ll be incurred.<p>On the upside, if the issue can be reproduced readily, from this we can almost always get root cause and put a systemic fix in place. If it&#x27;s sporadic... Well... I&#x27;m sure you understand how it goes trying to fix something that you can&#x27;t yet reproduce. ;)<p>(I&#x27;d love to troubleshoot your slow data backup issue...

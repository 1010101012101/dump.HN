The FBI is the most backwards agency technologically -- the leadership is mostly composed of people who actively oppose innovation.  At any other government agency, you can host user created applications that consolidate workflows and make peoples' lives much easier.  Some even have teams that are dedicated to creating these one-off solutions that don't fit into a general commercial/OSS workflow program.  The FBI, however, doesn't allow programming of any sort outside of the scope of their contracts, which mean that a regular analyst is storing data in an excel spreadsheet and trying to pass it around as a database.<p>I say actively oppose innovation, because I've seen people told to get in line and shut up when speaking out about how to make processes better.  This attitude mostly comes from a culture of ""special agents"" who are their own cool kid club.  Imagine a bunch of movie-stereotypical dumb jocks.  Now imagine them in front of a computer.  FBI.<p>The most egregious of technological sins I witnessed was when we told the FBI that if they appended a row id to the scattered data they were sending us, that it would literally save on the order of 10 million dollars a year in people not having to manually input things, but being able to parse the data out.  Their engineers came back and told us that it was not technologically possible.  I said that not knowing their systems, what languages they were using to program the database, or even the database structure itself, give me one hour in the code and I will make it happen.  Let's just say that didn't go over well.",1369501103

5767789,comment,5767664,5767664,7,0,RBerenguel,,,"Neat, love new approaches to old problems. At first sight I thought it would be an awesome implementation of an idea I had (and probably tons of other people before and after :) a few years ago to find cheating among C programming assignments: convert programs to PostScript ""drawings"": ifs, fors and certain other functions gave rise to different ""movements"" of the cursor, eventually drawing paths for different expressions. Since it didn't take into account variable names, malloc-calloc-free order or any other extraneous thing, it could pinpoint cheating with a relatively good accuracy (and indeed, we caught 3 cheaters among ~90 submissions, and one of them would have been pretty hard to spot without the tool.) If anyone's interested, it was created with lex and basically parsed the expressions I was interested. I think I wrote about it once in my blog, but I'm not sure if I ever published the code (it was hacky as hell!)",1369500806

5767775,comment,5767152,5767273,4,0,rz2k,,,"<i>A Brave New World</i> does seem more modern than <i>1984</i> even though it was written nearly 20 years earlier. I suppose it's because international politics right now resemble the early 1932 mood more closely than the mood in 1949.<p>The audience <i>A Brave New World</i> was written for probably didn't think that their countries faced existential threats or that much could happen that would radically change the world order. Reading texts around the early responses to the Great Depression you get a sense of a great dissatisfaction with the status quo, and that advocates of both fascist and of communist policies thought their biggest threat was the obstinance of the status quo rather than revolutionary change in the ""wrong"" direction. The dystopia of <i>A Brave New World</i> seems to have come about by a gradual but unstoppable transformation.<p>The <i>1984</i> audience on the other hand would accept a larger domain of world-changing possibilities, but perhaps have been conditioned to war, and have acknowledged that habituation toward a perpetual state of war was a tool for autocratic government, just as much as a government unchallenged by external threats had freedom to become autocratic. Though the <i>1984</i> world has war depicted as distant and a routine part of life, it was a key part of the story, and difference between the two stories might be summed up as the difference between a peacetime dystopia and a wartime dystopia.<p>You can probably find both trends in our own time. The people who dream of ""9/12"" as a better world, see the spirit surrounding national trauma as amenable to getting their way. Then on the other end, when you hear congressmen discussing regulations on the internet, they get hysterical about the lack of deference people creating new stuff have. I suppose the congressional smugness around how everything would be okay if we didn't have disobedient progress is more an example of what radicals in the 1930s feared, but it does typify the challenges that peacetime societies face.<p>Anyway, that was a long way to get at the point that I agree with you that <i>A Brave New World</i> is a more plausible scenario than <i>1984</i> right now at least. However, what you described as appealing struck me as pretty specifically what made <i>A Brave New World</i> a dystopia.<p>Sexual attractiveness is a part of sexual attraction. Furthermore it is a source of pleasure and enjoyment for people, not just a way that they are excluded. In <i>A Brave New World</i> sexual relationships were very low effortand I think that was the problem. Even if the algorithm were good enough not to just link you up with someone who is similar, but also found traits that are good complements, the unpredictable process of meeting someone who may not be perfect for you and the struggle and effort involved is pretty important.",1369500491

Everyone recognizes that engineers are more expensive than office space. Private offices result in engineers getting more done but working on the wrong things, or solving problems in slightly the wrong way. The goal is to expose developers to the organization more so they have a stronger sense of what users/customers value, and can make better decisions.<p>As a rough guess, optimal business value in an enterprise software company probably results from engineers spending 20-40% of their time with users/product managers/other stakeholders and 60-80% of their time actually programming/designing/working with other developers. These numbers are highly imprecise and depend on circumstances, but they're probably in the right order of magnitude.<p>The issue with private offices is that in my experience many engineers will prefer to spend 95% of their time engineering and just 5% of their time understanding the problem. As a result they build more features but the features are significantly less valuable. 2-3 person offices seems to mitigate that pretty well, while open plan offices seem to go way too far in the other direction.",1369500077

5767680,comment,5767290,5767554,4,0,cdwhite,,,"I would be surprised to find that the NSA has a quantum computer that can quickly factor large numbers.<p>There are very hard fundamental physics problems with quantum computing. IANAexpert, but as I understand it, the difficulty lies in closing off the system (cold atoms, what have you) you're using to do the computation from the outside world, while you're doing the computation. Any contact (up to a very, very low limit), and you smear (""decohere"") the computation so that the output will be in essence noise---not what we want at all. One can approach this as (in some sense) an engineering/experiment problem and try to limit contact with the outside world, or as a theory problem and try to come up with a system that inherently resists problematic contact with the outside world (topological quantum computation, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer</a>), comes to my mind).<p>So we're dealing with a <i>physics</i> problem: either the gloriously messy, difficult work of experiment, trying to track down and eliminate sources of decoherence, or the theoretical work of finding an appropriate system (and then figuring out how to implement it).<p>Both of these are far from the core competencies of the NSA, as I understand them (not that I have any real information---just an impression based on way to much time spent reading Hacker News :-) ). As you say, NSA is (perceived as) very, very good and far ahead of the community at computing, cryptography, and cryptanalysis. The problem is, this is not a computing problem, it's a physics problem.<p>One possibilty, though, is that the NSA has figured out some way to use something like the D-Wave quantum computer (which I am ridiculously far from understanding, but you might recall Scott Aaronson's blog post on the subject not too long ago) to factor large primes---that is to say, to transform prime factorization into the D-Wave problem. At a gut level, I find this much more plausible than that the NSA has independently built a quantum computer: that sort of problem-transformation is much more the kind of math that I <i>feel</i> the NSA would be good at, or be able to become good at very quickly.",1369499057

It's actually refreshing how they don't try to pass it as ""much better for the developer"".

I don't care how, perhaps you just dropped your Warby Parkers on your keyboard or something. Not only is the code now broken, but it <i>still compiles</i>. With &&, it would fail to compile and the error would be caught immediately.<p>The moral of the story is that syntax is your friend, not your enemy. Use syntax as much as possible to catch errors. Especially with strictly-typed languages, you have an incredible tool for automated verification of certain portions of your program. Use it.",1369498144

State LookupState(ZipCode zip);<p>So with solutions that don't involve wrapping everything in a class, you can incrementally develop your type by first doing the ""typedef"" and then adding functions.<p>So that's the problem with languages like Java.

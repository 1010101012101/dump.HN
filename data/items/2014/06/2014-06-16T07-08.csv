Why deal with it at all, when  .. with a little effort .. a cross-platform solution that works effectively on all platforms is a tangible, viable product?  Just consider the amount of work that had to be done to update apps for the recent changes in iOS&#x27; look and feel, and consider what life would be like if instead the effort was made on a cross-platform solution that put the application-standard GUI together, driven by the application-developer, not OS/hardware vendors whose motives are entirely driven by keeping developers away &#x27;from those other platforms&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;ve built big Android and big iOS projects.  Neither one of them is better than the other, in any sense whatsoever; both platforms have their thorns and pitfalls, and maintaining two separate codebases, with all the pitfalls, is just counter-productive.  Better to have one codebase that fits all and keeps the productivity where it needs to be: on the application, and not on keeping up with the joneses ..",1402905532

Battery life is still not acceptable</i><p>I switched to Moto X after using an iPhone for four and a half years. With the same usage patterns, my Moto X lasts as long as my iPhone 4 before. The Nexus 5 is apparently notorious when it comes to actual battery life.<p><i>Having to kill an app or cleaning their local cache are things I don&#x27;t want to do on my phone.

Even after all those years, iMessage messages would arrive minutes to ours too late or in the wrong order (very annoying when you have to meet with someone). iTunes Match would often only download albums partially. Calendar sync was not immediate (there was often a delay between adding an appointment and it showing up on the Mac and vise versa).<p>Since switching to Android I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back. It has decent keyboards (finally coming in iOS 8), I can actually share data between apps (finally coming in iOS 8), I can attach files from within the e-mail client (rather than only being able to pick a file from an app and then saying that I want to share it via e-mail). Google Now and voice recognition are awfully much better than Siri, especially because it&#x27;s actually integrated in the Google Now Launcher, and not an island on its own.<p>Besides that fact that I find Android far more pleasing, I bought my Moto X for half the price of an iPhone 5 and I have a data plan for 10 Euro per month. This means I can upgrade my phone every 8-12 month without spending a dime extra.",1402905257

I&#x27;m a proponent of Classical economics, and I reject all modern schools of economics--neoclassical, Austrian, Keynesian, etc.<p>Classical thinkers like Adam Smith expounded how rational self-interest <i>and</i> competition together lead to economic prosperity. There&#x27;s a balancing act going on between self-interest and competition--competition is the economic faculty that <i>restrains</i> self-interest.<p>Only in perfect competition do we get <i>Pareto efficiency</i>--the state in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.<p>Unfortunately, modern schools of economics have diminished the role of competition. Keynesianism lauds government monopoly power; while neoclassicism and Austrianism foster private monopoly power. Both are <i>evil</i>. The result has been a state of affairs wherein the vast majority of people are getting worse off.<p>WRT government intervention in the markets, Adam Smith would not oppose intervention that fosters competition and stifles monopoly. The goal of the 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act was to foster competition, not to diminish &quot;economic freedom.&quot;<p>&quot;Economic freedom&quot; is a mostly meaningless buzzword that&#x27;s thrown around by both libertarians and socialists. Indices of &quot;economic freedom&quot; as compiled by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal serve no other purpose than propaganda.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to divorce politics from economics in the real world. Adam Smith understood this. The subject used to be called &quot;politico-economics.&quot;<p>Today, the Left favors reforms to give government more monopoly power. While the Right favors reforms that give firms more monopoly power. Until people start to wake up and realize all monopoly power is evil and what we need instead is more competition, things will continue to decline.",1402904816

7897782,comment,7893440,7896932,1,0,cousin_it,,,"Yeah, that&#x27;s true for programs, i.e. things that accept no arguments. Lazy evaluation provably makes more programs terminate than any other evaluation strategy. But it&#x27;s kind of misleading for functions that accept arguments, like numbers or lists. Most functions in a lazy language can fail to terminate, because the arguments could fail to terminate or could be non-standard entities like omega. So, for example, the statement &quot;computing the length of a list always terminates&quot; is true in a strict language but not in a lazy one.<p>In general, strict languages allow you to say more about termination and time/space complexity of functions than lazy languages. For example, the statement &quot;computing the length of a list takes O(1) space&quot; is true in a strict language, but in a lazy language it&#x27;s difficult to say what the statement even means, and in most practical cases it&#x27;s false. Computing length with either foldr and foldl uses at least O(n) space, and the usual advice is to use foldl&#x27;, which has a strictness annotation. I think this should be alarming to anyone who recommends lazy evaluation as the right default.<p>In slightly more complicated cases, like sorting a list, there&#x27;s no sensible way to assign a time or space complexity at all, because it depends on how the function is called and how much of the result is used by the caller. People sometimes claim that&#x27;s an advantage of lazy languages, e.g. implementing quickselect in terms of quicksort and claiming that quickselect will only evaluate as much of quicksort as needed.

7897774,comment,7895966,7897464,1,0,gojomo,,,"Quite common, in my experience:<p>Landlord has been using the same faded form contract for a decade; doesn&#x27;t even know for sure which provisions are in it, or still legal under recent legislation or court decisions. (But, a standard &#x27;severability&#x27; clause protects them when they&#x27;ve got illegal and unenforceable terms inside their template.)<p>Renter skims contract, but doesn&#x27;t consider its terms  negotiable, practically speaking. They often ignore the precise terms regarding notices, houseguests for more than X days, small pets, drugs on the premises, new roommates, sublettors, etc. In many cases the local law, or tenants&#x27; legal support groups, will defend them for violations of such terms - because the signed lease was illegal or unreasonable.<p>During the course of the lease, both the landlord and the renter may deviate from the exact terms from time to time, by tacit agreement, or occasionally verbal agreement (even if the contract stipulates &quot;no verbal amendments&quot;).<p>Many renter violations are essentially in the realm of &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot;. The landlord doesn&#x27;t really care and also doesn&#x27;t want to know, because knowing would force conscious acknowledgement, perhaps encouraging further violations or incurring liability. Only if there&#x27;s actual property damage or risk of harm/liability (or other adversarialism has begun from other factors) does the landlord become interested in monitoring and enforcing every clause.<p>Into this mix comes AirBnB. Many landlords won&#x27;t notice the activity. Or they&#x27;ll suspect it but don&#x27;t want to pry. Or they&#x27;ll <i>know</i>, but don&#x27;t want to be known to &quot;know&quot;.<p>Yet they may notice the rental rates the market will bear go up, benefiting them for looking-the-other-way. They may notice the renter&#x27;s treatment of the property improving – as they now share an extra interest in its appeal. Compared to an empty room/apartment, the presence of good guests can make the property and neighborhood a safer and more pleasant place. So landlords can benefit implicitly even without an explicit renegotiation of terms.<p>In fact, they may prefer this sort of indirect benefit – because they retain the optionality of enforcing the terms, if things go poorly, without the risk of formally approving the activity.<p>Real economic and social relationships are way more complicated than, &quot;the letter of the rules is X so everyone is duty-bound to do no more nor less than X&quot;.",1402903696

In Australia it is often not sunny for days on end, also it is often not windy for days on end, over huge areas of land - you know, like, bigger than a lot of European countries.<p>For wind and solar to be economically competitive with coal / gas / nuclear they have to be at price parity including 24+hrs storage. This isn&#x27;t going to happen any time soon without massive government incentive.<p>Professor Barry Brook of Adelaide University has been blogging about this for a good few years now. We need to think critically about &#x27;sustainable energy&#x27;. I encourage you all to read his blog [1], particularly the TCASE [2] (Thinking Critically About Sustainable Energy) series.<p>Let&#x27;s level the playing field: ultimately there are only two good metrics worth considering a) life-time cost per kWh and b) life-time CO2 emissions per kWh --- but to level the playing field you need to consider each generating technology on a base-load comparison. It&#x27;s no good comparing a 1GW gas plant and a 1GW nameplate solar installation <i>because the sun only shines about 6.5hrs per day averaged throughout the year in, say, Adelaide for example</i>, so you typically need to over-build solar by a factor of 4 and then add storage. When you do that the life-time cost and life-time CO2 emissions aren&#x27;t so crash got because of the massive amounts of energy intensive stainless steel, steel, and concrete required, plus new transmission lines.<p>If you want to see a real-world example of how wind <i>does</i> work, check the UK National Grid Status site [3] - the wind hasn&#x27;t been blowing in the UK for <i>weeks</i>, presently their 8GW of installed wind is generating 0.82GW electricity.<p>The data speaks for itself, look at the graphs. A vote for wind / solar <i>is a vote for new gas</i> _because_ gas is easily load following. Of course, the gas plant owners don&#x27;t like that because when the wind blows their plants sit idle.<p>The whole renewable energy push is an expensive mess. I&#x27;ve commented elsewhere on HN about this, so I&#x27;ll stop repeating myself now.<p>1. <a href=""http://bravenewclimate.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bravenewclimate.com/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://bravenewclimate.com/?s=TCASE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bravenewclimate.com/?s=TCASE</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/</a><p>Edit: formatting",1402903015

Liquid water is a high density fluid and steam is low density fluid.<p>There is line on the phase diagram that separates the liquid field from the vapour field. On that line is the only place on the diagram where liquid and vapour can coexist, i.e. where boiling can occur. It happens to be the case that the surface of the earth is in the liquid field, but within vicinity of that line, so if you heat some water up, you can watch it boil. However, at ~250°C, you need to be at a pressure of ~4 MPa to observe boiling. At those conditions the density of the liquid will be ~0.8 g/cc and the vapour ~0.2 g/cc.<p>The liquid-vapour phase boundary (the boiling curve) terminates at the critical point (647 K and 22.064 MPa). Above the critical point H2O is supercritical. On inspection of the phase diagram we see isochores radiating out from the critical point. Above the critical point the density of water can vary smoothly as a function of P and T, and there is no boiling, condensation, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about power generation, but presumably when you can maintain temperatures higher than the T of the critical point, you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing energy to phase changes.",1402902673

That put them in a unique position to serve as a conduit not just for news but also for things like business advertisements, all of which was enormously lucrative. Many folks fell into the trap of thinking that because local reporting was highly needed and very popular that it was good. You see that in the way that newspapers and journalists are portrayed through most of the 20th century.<p>And then along came the internet, the king of all disintermediators. First local print news lost its readership and ad revenue, and many thought it was a matter of media, printed matter vs digital matter. Then over many years a lot of newspapers shut down, while others attempted to modernize and enter the digital age. And now we&#x27;re at a stage where the truth is harder to hide from. The fact is that most journalism just isn&#x27;t very good, and never has been. But when it was the only thing available it was better than nothing so it was consumed regardless.<p>Now the regurgitation of wire reports, simple duplicate coverage of a story, and uncritical passing on of news releases from 3rd parties holds no value. Those are things that rely on distribution, and in the internet age that is trivial. This puts into sharper focus the kernel of original, serious reporting that journalist do. And it turns out they have historically done very, very little, and even less of it of any serious value.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that print journalism uses an outdated media, the problem is that the vast majority of what used to pass for journalism is now largely redundant. And most traditional news organizations still don&#x27;t realize this or understand that the news organizations which will be able to survive in the 21st century will be very, very different from those of the past, and not just old organizations with a few modernizations bolted on. That&#x27;s a tough pill to swallow because it means both that most journalists have quite frankly not been doing worthwhile work, it also means that there is no place for the vast majority of traditional journalism jobs. People within the industry naturally flinch away from such hard truths, but it won&#x27;t stop them from being true.",1402902483

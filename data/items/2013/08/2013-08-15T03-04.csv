6216076,comment,6211029,6213958,2,0,bradleyjg,,,"The nuclear triad always seemed a bit circular to me. We have three main means of delivering nuclear weapons, so it must be a good idea to have three different means of delivering nuclear weapons. I don&#x27;t see it. With geographic diversity and at least one delivery system that is mobile and easy to hide we should be more than capable of asserting a second strike capability.<p>What&#x27;s really needed from a modern bomber is a high munition capacity, a large combat radius, and long loiter times. Cheap to build and operate would be great too. Super stealth as well as high speeds and maneuverability are simply expensive distractions.<p>For the rare situation where we need to deliver something like a conventional bunker buster deep inside of territory that we don&#x27;t wish to first completely destroy the AA cababilities of first -- i.e. an Osirak type mission -- we still have 20 of those $2 billion B-2s.",1376539050

Formal training strives to ensure everything has been covered to an appropriate degree, and subsequent self-teaching is done with an awareness that such thoroughness should be sought.

6216068,comment,6214553,6215359,4,0,kyzyl,,,"I had this thought was well. As as physics major and an EE major, it&#x27;s a (somewhat humorously) terrifying concept, at some level.<p>Now this has more or less been discussed to death in the threads above and below, but while I don&#x27;t necessarily think running JS on a uC is a <i>great</i> idea, I don&#x27;t see a problem with letting non-hardware-versed folk write low level code. People who know hardware will probably not use it for anything critical, and if it makes someone&#x27;s life easier without endangering others or utterly diluting the community (knock on wood...) then so be it. There&#x27;s no reason to be elitist about low level programming.<p>At this moment my workspace consists of a bit of code for an 8bit microcontroller, a FPGA layout + VHDL, and a mixed signal high speed PCB layout I&#x27;ve been laboring over for the better part of two weeks. Take that, &quot;low level&quot; C! Now I could go off about how superior and/or necessary my low level methods are, but my friend who&#x27;s working on an ASIC design might say something similar to me. There&#x27;s always a lower level. As always it&#x27;s a little bit about preference, and a lot about using the appropriate tool for the job.<p>I might have a problem if  web developers started cramming JS onto arduinos and calling themselves competent hardware engineers, but (and I think most people in the field would agree with me) I suspect the likelihood of that happening is negligible. It becomes apparent very, very quickly when someone is pretending to know how to hardware.",1376538918

Granted, this coincided with me actively practicing puzzles and trick questions (essentially this is what the high end questions are) but I <i>felt</i> noticeably sharper. Like I&#x27;d gained 10-20 IQ points. Prior to this I drank quite often over several years (college plus a few post college years). This break (and my awareness of its effects) caused me to really curb my drinking. Now I drink sparsely and mostly to appreciate a nice wine or beer or well made cocktail.

6216045,comment,6215601,6215975,6,0,christopheraden,,,"As someone who did graduate work in Bayesian methods for a statistics master&#x27;s degree, I take offense to saying machine learning is not a concern of statistics and data mining (but not really)! The hesitance towards Bayesian methods seems more related to the discipline, and it seems that places that call what they do &quot;machine learning&quot; tend to be less hostile towards the explicit subjectivity of Bayes (I would highlight the word &quot;explicit&quot; in that sentence--Frequentism has it&#x27;s fair share of subjectivity as well).<p>There was a great post on Stats.SE a few years ago about the difference between statistics and machine learning[1]. Leo Breiman once argued that statistics tends to focus more on model fitting and checking, while machine learning looked at prediction accuracy. The exchange between Andy Gelman and Brendan O&#x27;Connor is pretty funny. It has been my personal experience however that many people that apply a method that they brand as &quot;machine learning&quot; are not as bothered with assumptions as my fellow conservative statisticians.<p>But statistics and machine learning are quite similar in foundation. Barring the differences in terminology, as a professional statistician, I find I have as little difficulty read machine learning papers and algorithms as I do reading statistics ones.<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-...</a>",1376538563

So, it can be difficult to discern whether your company is failing because of the minimal product (especially in these days of &quot;high design&quot;), because of some other execution element, or just no market fit.<p>I also think the  MVP approach is suitable to businesses with specific characteristics and these may be relatively rare. In this case, the business already had fairly extensive relationships with its target market on both sides of the equation. That was key, I believe, as much of the marketing legwork had been done and the established trust could override any qualms about such a minimalist approach. Also, the nature of the business was such that simple forms and manual processes were sufficient to start. That is frequently not the case with tech businesses.<p>This is not to disparage their accomplishments in the slightest. It was an astute pivot and their approach was smart. It&#x27;s just that the mantra of MVP, fast iterations, fail fast, etc. has been the magic hammer lately, and too many companies have been nails.",1376537369

Carriers usually allow forwarding to certain IP destination or hostnames like sbc.plivo.com, so what you will need to do on your carrier side is to just configure this one time for the numbers with them.<p>On the Plivo side, for us to be able to enable the carrier to pass through our firewall, you would whitelist the Carrier IPs using our APIs/UI and then add (not buy) the numbers in the system you own with the carrier. That we it allows us to be able to match the incoming calls from a certain carrier on a certain number to a customer app. (there are tons of edge cases here I am not covering, but we have taken care of that in the implementation)<p>Outbound Calls via your Carrier to phones<p>This is a bit more tricky and complex as users may want to use Carrier 1 for Country A, Carrier 2 for Country B etc.. so we allow customers to be able to configure this logic using our APIs and assign them with dedicated IPs which allows the carrier to distinguish where the call is coming from for them to bill/ account it.<p>It may sound simple here, but trust me, when you open up that kind of logic to every customer, it becomes a tough problem quickly and thats where architecture matters.  I am not sure, I want to talk about how we architected the system, so will leave it for later discussion.<p>Regarding DoS or DDoS, IP spoofing is not so trivial, as first one needs to figure out carrier ip, then customers phone number and then all they can do is just trigger the app which can perform some business logic.

Take a nice-looking language, add a web framework, and developers can instantly do something useful in a language they like. And as you say, it&#x27;s a widespread need, so even a percentage of that attention is quite a few people.<p>I think if a language really nailed a niche, especially a lucrative one like scientific/numeric computing, it could be successful on those merits alone, because it would get a large percentage of that niche.",1376535922

If you don&#x27;t, they don&#x27;t.  People just WANT to hate Sandberg. An internship is a chance to learn; you aren&#x27;t entitled to learn at a company.  Paid interns are the exception; they are odd.  You&#x27;re used too Google too quickly and clearly don&#x27;t understand how most industries operate.  If you think apprenticing would be more beneficial, call it that.  Interning is an opportunity to learn, not to pay rent.",1376535881

So DRM by design dictates the risk of malware and privacy violation by the publisher (as a natural mirror towards DRM assuming that users are potential criminal infringers by default). It&#x27;s a good reason to avoid using any DRMed services - i.e. lack of trust inherent in the DRM <i>by definition</i>.<p>If you prefer to call it FUD, start with the DRM itself.

5257103,comment,5256834,5256834,2,0,NamTaf,,,"This isn't the first time Sony's ripped artwork off.<p>Back in early 2006 I left a webpage comment (haha, remember them?) with the admins at Digital Blasphemy (that CGI desktop wallpaper site everyone loved back in the day) because I was playing with a mate's Sony W800i mobile phone and noticed that they'd ripped off an image called 'Fluroescence' [1] to create an animated mobile background image - there's a whole series of that image in different colours with different transparencies and they'd just grabbed them all and made an anmiated GIF that faded between them. In doing so, they'd cropped the DigitalBlasphemy watermark in making it a portrait aspect ratio and as far as I could tell not credited DB anywhere.<p>I ended up getting a 'thanks I'll look in to it' reply, but don't know if anything ever came of it. I figured at the time it may have been the mistake of a lazy artwork designer but part of management of such a project surely must be to ensure that all of the content is legit. It's certainly interesting to see that this company has done this again. As previously, it may well have been the work of a lone employee but it is still the company's responbility to stop that behaviour.<p>I hope KDE can get a favourable resolution to this problem.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://digitalblasphemy.com/preview.shtml?i=fluorescence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digitalblasphemy.com/preview.shtml?i=fluorescence</a>",1361451568

Some random examples:<p>Fuck m all
You failed
Having lost touch
You just got lucky
Being average
It is ok to be xyz
You arent alone
Own it
It sucks
Things may not be as bad
Disappointing
Frustrating
Dont give up

It can be hard to keep our head
Freaked out
Taking other peoples money is a big one
On the brink of bankruptcy
Staring death in the eye
Going down with the ship
Dont worry
Poems and questions from social heroes<p>Emotional generalizations, value-based references, hero-based metaphors are stomach (feeling) based expressions. 
Probably posted in the hope to change our colleagues feelings. I hope it works.<p>An additional approach is to move our focus & energy away from the stomach and into to the head (thinking).
As such, a non-emotional metaphor would be something like: 
A startup = an analysis + a set of assumptions/decisions + certain actions, resulting in specific projected results.
The original analysis includes the resource constraints assumptions (yup, if xyz happens, we will run out of $ by this month).
Then the standard actions start:  
Regular review the of obtained results + if not as projected, revisit the analysis, decisions and actions. Keep doing these steps till the projected results are realized or till the resources run out. 
Whatever comes first.

I don't think it intends to replace UDP. If anything, I would describe it as a user space replacement for TCP. It uses UDP, yes, but that's because UDP is about as close as you can get to IP at the user level.<p>It's about time, too. Certainly user-level substitutes for TCP are not a new idea (I've worked a good deal with UDT), but this the first one to my knowledge that has the weight of something like Google behind it.<p>There are a lot of advantages to doing this as the user level with UDP as well. Not needing to install a kernel module, for one. But also P2P rendezvous connections through NAT with UDP (we wouldn't even need to wait for router manufacturers to adopt anything), better control over protocol options without going through the kernel, custom congestion control algorithms, finer control over buffers (mmap'd files as buffer for file transfers anyone?), etc.<p>I'd much rather see this at the kernel level, but TCP as it's implemented on most systems has too many issues on modern networks, and most acceptable user-level solutions (ugh, parallel streams) are really terrible hacks. If Google does it right, maybe it'll force OS developers to wake up and rethink the increasingly clunky and antiquated BSD sockets API that is the source of many of TCP's woes and finally modernize the network stack for the fiber era.",1361450097

If you don't follow windowing semantics of TCP, then one of two things will happen on saturated links - either TCP will end up with all the bandwidth or you will.<p>So - surprise! - you have no choice but to design a TCP clone.<p>[ EDIT ]<p>That said, there <i>is</i> a fundamental problem with TCP, when it's used for carrying secure connections. Since TCP acts as a pure transport protocol, it has no per-packet authentication and so any connection can be trivially DoS'd with a single fake FIN or RST packet. There are ways to solve this, e.g. by reversing the TCP and security layers and running TCP over ESP-over-UDP or TLS-over-UDP (OpenVPN protocol). This requires either writing a user-space TCP library or doing some nasty tunneling at the kernel level, but even as cumbersome as this is, it's still not a reason enough to re-invent the wheel. Also, if you want compression, it's readily available in TLS or as a part of IPsec stack (IPcomp). If you want FEC, same thing - just add a custom transform to TLS and let the client and server negotiate if to use it or not.<p>I mean, every network programmer invents a protocol or two in his lifetime.

two things:
I am year older than you, you know what psychologist said to me, only time I ever visited her(I had to, for some paperwork)? I am still not grown up. If you are under 30, you are still not fully developed.<p>Second, there seems to be unlucky amount of not your kind of people around you.

Archival feature would be great, even if it just shells out to httrack. If used on a local machine, the disk space is not a great concern.<p>With 0.0.40 beta, I was having the problem about ""Wrong login/password"" and ""Wrong token"". It would be great if you could apply the fix described by this user:<p>lgaggini, 2012/11/10 18:59, <a href=""http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli:discussion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli:discussio...</a><p>> I host last beta of shaarli (0.0.40) on my local network and I access it by custom name defined in clients hosts file and relative virtual host configuration in my nginx web server. My browser is Chromium (22.0.1229.94 (161065)). After the first configuration, every time I try to login I receive the Wrong login/pass error. After some investigation and debugging I discover a problem with cookie management (only in Chromium, in Firefox all work flawlessly). With the default code and Chromium, the cookie is correctly written by the browser, but it's not retrieved so all checks performed on sessions value (mainly tokenOK() and isLoggedIn()) fail. To fix I have to replace, in the main code index.php, the session cookie path parameter, from dirname($_SERVER[SCRIPT_NAME]).'/' to dirname($_SERVER[SCRIPT_NAME]) (short story, i remove the trailing /). I hope to help someone else with similar problem. Regards and keep up the good work.",1361448085

I have to assume yes.<p>If we are 30km apart and we are actually connected to two neighbouring balloons, will they route traffic between them, and again, not via the base station? Again, have to assume yes.<p>So do I get a single IP address, or do I keep changing when the balloons are overhead? I assume I get a single IP address, but my home router is actually going to have to do some intelligent next hop routing.<p>Mesh networking is a challenging area when the base stations are fixed, with weather effects and moving end users an issue. Even more challenging when your &quot;base stations&quot; are moving, weather effects are significantly greater, and you&#x27;re super limited to the amount of onboard processing you can do.<p>Assume it has to be something like BATMAN. <a href=""http://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki/BATMANConcept"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki/BATMANConce...</a>",1371383997

It is true that ORMs do not solve all problems for all people, but it is also true that they solve some problems for some people.  There is no point in hashing it out without knowing what OP or me or you or some particular person is doing.<p>> being able to do arbitrary schema migrations is considerably harder<p>Being able to do arbitrary schema migrations is not a feature anybody is seriously suggesting, either for SQLite, sqlalchemy, alembic, or any other tool. What is being suggested is merely that SQLite support ALTER TABLE, a very particular, well-defined feature that has been standardized since at least 1992. In the intervening <i>two decades</i> I am not aware of any serious proposals to the effect that the standardized behavior is flawed, although there are various vendor-specific extensions. If you would like to raise an objection to the standard, I would be greatly intrigued.<p>> I couldn&#x27;t find an explanation as to why they think the copy and adjust approach would be so hard<p>All snark aside, four out of five SQL vendors support alter table. They would be doing this logic <i>solely</i> for SQLite. Why would they do that?  The path of least resistance is just to tell people to migrate to MySQL. That&#x27;s what people who need migration support end up doing.<p>> alter table is very infrequently mentioned<p>You seem to anticipate that users will discover that SQLite does not support alter table correctly, and that following this discovery they will continue to use SQLite. My experience is at variance with your anticipation.<p>Specifically, I don&#x27;t post to SQLite-users, first and foremost, because I am not a SQLite user, because it does not support alter table.

5888130,comment,5888059,5888078,13,0,pron,,,"I&#x27;d say everywhere in the western world other than the US. People often forget that the whole purpose of government is to protect us from that organization of society that naturally arose in the West (and east Asia, too) before central governments, namely feudalism. When no central authority regulates power, power would always become concentrated in the hands of the few, who would inevitably subjugate the many through economic bonds.<p>While, like many, I am appalled at the NSA&#x27;s supposed massive-scale surveillance, I fear surveillance by corporations like Google much more. The fact that people share their most private information with Google <i>voluntarily</i> actually makes it worse. If you want to know where real power lies, look for power that is not only feared, but loved (say, your mother :)). Many people have referred to the book <i>1984</i> in the past week, but they&#x27;ve all missed one crucial point: Big Brother is not feared; he is loved. At the end of the book, Winston <i>voluntarily</i> subjugates himself to Big Brother. He loves Big Brother.<p>As long as the NSA has <i>some</i> form of oversight, however dysfunctional -- as long as government is at least suspect -- we&#x27;ll be fine. But the much bigger danger is Google itself, the power that people love; that they voluntarily subjugate themselves to. It seems that Americans, perhaps because their government was formed not from feudalism, but as a rebellion against a foreign central government -- are very much aware of the dangers of government, but are blind to the much bigger threat of feudalism.",1371381792

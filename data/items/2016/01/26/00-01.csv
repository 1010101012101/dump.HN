When we’re discussing shorter vs. longer functions today, it seems fair to say we’re usually considering scales of perhaps 5 lines vs. 25 lines vs. 100 lines. I did write “longer <i>but otherwise reasonable</i>”, and by the time we’re talking about 200+ lines in a single function, I expect most of us would consider most such functions undesirable for reasons other than their length.<p><i>I wouldn&#x27;t advocate for a strictly short functions either, but the overall body of evidence definitely does _not_ suggest the opposite conclusion: the opposite conclusion would be that we should endeavour to write long functions!</i><p>Well, some of the evidence does seem to suggest that that might be a better strategy, within the bounds of common sense and other things being equal.<p>However, in reality, I don’t think other things <i>are</i> equal most of the time in programming. Personally, I find criteria like having one responsibility and clearly describing how it is met more useful for writing good functions than crude metrics like the number of lines.<p>Given that there are a lot of correlations between otherwise undesirable features and function length, we should be wary of assuming causal relationships in any case. But we surely shouldn’t be advocating the trendy very-short-functions approach as some obviously superior style when if anything the balance of evidence is against it.",1453768790

Technology is the primary reason for this because 1) costs become so much lower that it can be provided for virtually free, 2) new business models can be created that were not possible before.<p>Now with an Internet connection anyone can create a business.<p>With things like Coursera, Udacity, Khan Academy, etc education has been more accessible and free.<p>There are also more options for financing, both from traditional banks being more liberal in their lending as well as new routes like Kickstarter style crowd funding and peer-to-peer lending.<p>That being said, the distribution for people who will be motivated to educate themselves, work hard, build a business, will stay the same because human nature doesn&#x27;t change as fast as technology.  If various kinds of human attributes / behaviors / motivation fall on a Gaussian distribution, then any kind of leverage will make it sharper (more inequality).<p>So what I think is going to happen is that inequality will get worse but it will be more fair because it won&#x27;t be the case that that leverage wasn&#x27;t available to them, it will increasingly be the case that they just didn&#x27;t take advantage of it despite having access to it.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s a generalization and a trend but the opposite has some weight as well.

But at the same time, disruptive technologies like Internet based education, P2P lending, etc make those concentrations of wealth irrelevant.<p>In the long run, technology disrupts and democratizes everything.

How do you format the video for it to be consumable by a normal user? Filling your hard drive with thousands of small video files is not a great experience, so that&#x27;s a problem. We could buffer as much as we can in-camera and then FTP a biggish (200mb) video file. Now that introduces a delay, because you can&#x27;t really watch the video until you are done buffering, so no real-timish stream. So you have to come up with a third alternative that provides every other feature the online camera has, because users <i>will</i> complain if their offline experience is different.<p>Then again, your local NAS might be stolen by the same burglars that broke into your house, and the whole exercise was a waste of everyone&#x27;s time.<p>Multiply that for each other possible combination (&quot;I want Dropbox support!&quot;, &quot;I want my files to be in an AVI container instead of MP4!&quot;, &quot;I want the camera to have a SIM slot so it can send me SMS messages when there&#x27;s a notification!&quot;) and you have a recipe for disaster.

This was supposed to be a &quot;5 minute setup&quot;)<p>2) a product that evolved over time: running features in the cloud allows you to give new value to device owners without requiring a new device<p>3) trusting the company to have strict internal processes to avoid unintentional or malicious access to anyone&#x27;s video (this was not treated lightly: a single case of anyone snooping on someone&#x27;s stream could completely ruin the trust the users put on us.)",1453768670

10971017,comment,10964408,10970671,0,0,Lazare,,,"Parts of that is right, but I think you mis-state a lot of the ratings stuff.<p>The fundamental idea behind the ratings is (simplifying a lot) that you could take a lot of crap mortgages and then slice them into tranches, assigning losses to the lowest tranches first, and to the highest tranches last.  So if you have 1000 mortgages, and you slice it into 10 tranches of 100 each, and 250 mortgages go bad, then the lowest two tranches lose 100%, the next tranche loses 50%, and the top 7 tranches lose 0%.  What the ratings agencies were doing by assigning AAA grades to the top tranches was estimating the likelihood that <i>EVERYTHING</i> would go bad was very low.<p>And what I think a lot of people miss about the financial crisis is that <i>this was not wrong</i>.  Not only was it correct in principle, but actual losses on AAA rated securities was extremely low because even among subprime a lot kept on being serviced.  So the ratings agencies said &quot;hell, we could have a massive crisis and these top tranches will still mostly pay out&quot;, and then we did have a massive crisis, <i>and those top tranches still mostly paid out</i>.<p>There were a lot of issues and problems and corners cut and bad paperwork and robosigning and a hundred and one other scandals, some quite significant.  However when you say:<p>> They had assumed that &quot;AAA&quot; would remain relatively safe.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that this assumption was shown to be correct!  From the financial crisis inquiry report:<p>&quot;Overall, for 2005 to 2007 vintage tranches of mortgage-backed securities originally rated triple-A, despite the mass downgrades, only [...] 4% of subprime securities had [...] losses imminent or had already been suffered by the end of 2009.&quot;<p>On the other hand, something like 95% of lower rated tranches ended up suffering losses.  The tranches were a mechanism for concentrating credit risk in the lower tranches; the problem isn&#x27;t that it didn&#x27;t work, but that 1) it worked really well and 2) everyone was badly underestimating the total about of credit risk in the system.  AAA was mostly fine; everything short of AAA was absolute <i>toast</i>.<p>(Also, I think you&#x27;re missing how <i>huge</i> the decline in home prices was, both as cause and vector of the crisis.  A vast amount of paper wealth nominally owned by the middle class vanished in a puff of smoke; most of the crisis was the result of that.  But the impacts of an asset price bubble should properly be attributed to its inflation, not it&#x27;s popping.)",1453766724

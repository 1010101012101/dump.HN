What makes you think they would mean something else when they speak of a Dart VM?<p>They are right in calling V8 a VM. Your right too there is no need to have a bytecode befor going to native. Its however pretty comon thing to do. I think its a good idea if a VM builds a good bytecode befor running and I didnt thing about the direct way.\n(Node: V8 sometimes has intermediate steps.

To first build a bytecode out of all your code can be a good idea. LuaJit for example always builds bytecode befor going to native. Pretty comon thing to do.",1324641598

3385442,comment,3384565,3385348,1,0,andyking,,,"The only time I ever had a fraudulent transaction on my card, it wasn't stopped until they'd wiped out my account by gambling £1,900 of my money on Littlewoods Online. The bank never stopped my account, the criminals only stopped taking money when they'd emptied the account and run up an overdraft, at which point my card started declining. I only found out when I tried to buy a train ticket home and got 'card declined.'<p>I got the money back, but I was totally skint for a fortnight while the bank and police sorted it out. It was nothing to do with being overseas, either. My card got cloned at a well known Indian restaurant in Manchester.<p>Meanwhile, the same bank <i>did</i> stop my card for fraud prevention when I legitimately travelled to the US and used it there, myself, to buy a few bits and bobs in Target and get some cash out of an ATM, totalling all of about $70. I had to make an expensive mobile phone call back to them in Britain to tell them that yes, it's me. I don't think they get it sometimes.<p>They seem to do it solely by geography. UK good, overseas bad. Whereas if they had an iota of common sense, they would have been able to say ""look, this guy's never spent a penny on gambling before, why has he suddenly spent his entire pay and overdraft on a betting website,"" and ""look, he bought a plane ticket from American Airlines the other week, now he's using his card in the US, it's legit.""<p>Surely there's some bright startup out there who could do this with data?",1324641452

3385416,comment,3385276,3385276,12,0,danieldk,,,"Blaming Lennart (not Leonard!) is a bit counterproductive. There's a general tendency in the desktop Linux community to rewrite components every few years, rather than improving what exists.<p>I guess this is mainly caused by the failure of Linux as a commercial desktop. Except for heroic efforts by Red Hat, SUSE, and previously Sun, it's mostly a hobbyist affair. As a hobby, people prefer to do the fun work, not the tedious and boring maintenance, bugfixing, and polishing.<p>The quality of Linux as a desktop operating system is in stark contrast with Linux as a server operating system. Thanks to the enormous amount of money invested in server-related components, Linux as a server is generally very polished and reliable.<p>On a personal note, the effort required to maintain a stable Linux desktop made me switch to OS X in 2007, after using Linux for 13 years.",1324640682

Banks were previously bailed out on the basis that this would be terrible for the people whose assets/savings were held at banks that failed because they could not return those assets to the people.<p>But things have changed since then... firstly governments have guaranteed people's assets in the event that a bank fails. In addition some countries took charge of their banks, notably the UK, meaning that at least from a ""business as usual"" case, it is not inconceivable nor technically impossible to move the accounts from a failing bank into a nationalised bank.<p>So if the banks were to default now, the situation would be different. The governments <i>could</i> let a bank or many banks fail and with careful management take back control.<p>One other point is that banks can make very large profits in a very short space of time. LloydsTSB in under six months following the write-down of massive losses in the crisis, made a first quarter profit of 3 billion pounds. I don't know many companies that can turn things around that quickly, but banks regularly do.<p>This, to my mind, makes it less credible to hold the threat of many banks defaulting over the heads of the governments, and is another reason why I say the governments make the call.",1324639633

3385372,comment,3383209,3384988,3,0,camperman,,,"No indeed, it wouldn't. But there is considerable evidence for the event, some would say overwhelming. There are multiple eyewitness accounts written by different people, sometimes using the same sources, sometimes different ones; disinterested Roman and Jewish historians make mention of it and hostile sceptics of the day mock it as offensive (which of course it is - and still is :)). At no point was this movement stopped in its tracks by the simplest means possible - producing a corpse - and even more incredibly, subsequent claims by followers were conducted in the full glare of publicity, to the point of including famous personalities of the day, even a Roman emperor. If you're going to start a new movement based on a lie, you don't generally include people who have the power to nix your claims in a heartbeat. Not only that but the claims often cost those who were making them their lives. Despite that, it was able to subvert the Roman empire in just a few hundred years.<p>Archaeology confirms in minute detail that the historical journeys of the early missionaries were as described and one of the authors is called the finest historian who ever lived. Copies of those documents date back to just after the events they described and centuries of banging on them and subjecting them to the closest scrutiny shows that they are as they say they are. Other ancient literature is meager by comparison. We have a handful of copies of Tacitus dated 800 years to a millenium after the events he describes yet no-one sees him as unreliable. Copies of the NT documents number in the <i>thousands</i>, some of which are carbon dated to a few decades after the fall of Jerusalem and all of a sudden they're questionable. Uh huh. Well, we can chuck out most of Roman history and all of Alexander the Great by that yardstick then.<p>Just what sort of evidence are you looking for?",1324638518

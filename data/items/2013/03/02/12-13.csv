What would be the situation like, if we were printing millions of books with 20 dpi technology? Would this be ignored by the masses and people who are annoyed by the eye-hurting results would be trolls?<p>We should see this as a clear (<i>cough</i>) signal, that it is time to start some major broken-font-campaign - more and more web developers seem to be so overloaded with CSS and JS framework learning, they totally forget about the most basic things - IMHO it is still the first and most noble duty of a real webdev to make a site nicely readable on all displays.<p>This annoying font-disease must be taken very seriously - it is ignoring the most important aspects of life: health. I feel offended if somebody forces me to read a website with such a broken font - it hurts my eyes, and as a computer guy I need my eyes for work, so it is a serious attack.<p>I was humbly accepting it as a personal disability for years, that I needed WinXP fonts on every Linux distro to have a satisfying font display. But I kept wondering about how the creators of thousands of Linux tutorial screenshots could not realize that they were looking at a broken font and destroying the functionality of their most important input devices.<p>Luckily in the last years it got much better on Linux, but then came the iFlood, Win7, and finally the ultimate weapon of ophthalmologists for generating an endless income stream: webfonts.<p>Now I am confronted every single day with websites with broken fonts. This is a serious regression and every web designer and every programmer involved in font rendering code should stop working on anything else until this problem is fixed.<p>Yes, I know there are many reasons for this problem, it is not only the web developers - anyway, please let us fix it now.",1362228688

Granted.<p>However, equating the Harlem Shake meme to blackface performances is ivory tower nonsense that belies a willful ignorance to what Internet memes are.  No one is profiting from this and it's not diminishing black culture in any way.  If you put it back in context then you don't have a viral video because the stupidity and brevity of the whole thing is what <i>made</i> it viral.  Just because it got huge and it annoys you doesn't mean that it's part of the problem of racism.  It's just an idiotic meme that people watch when they're slacking off at their dead-end white collar jobs.  If you actually care about improving societal racism you need to address more important issues like why aren't more black people getting hired and why don't they have more political power, etc.  If you get all riled up and insist that anything black needs to be represented in context and everyone always needs to stop and think about how unfair it is that white people can listen to black music without actually suffering the pain of a racist society that led to the creation of that music all you will do is make people want to stay the fuck away from you because being white in your vicinity is like walking on egg shells.

Interestingly, with very different approaches. So there's little reason NOT to use objects, dictionaries, tables, maps or whatever it's called in your favorite language.<p>(1) If you really, really care about the last 10% or direct interoperability with C, LuaJIT offers native C structs via its FFI. And PyPy has inherited the FFI design, so they should be able to get the same performance someday. I'm sure v8 has something to offer for that, too.<p>Allocations: LuaJIT has allocation sinking, which is able to eliminate the mentioned temporary allocations. Incidentally, the link shows how that's done for a x,y,z point class! And it works the same for ALL cases: arrays {1,2,3} (on top of a generic table), hash tables {x=1,y=2,z=3} or FFI C structs.<p>String handling: Same as above -- a buffer is just a temporary allocation and can be sunk, too. Provided the stores (copies) are eliminated first. The extracted parts can be forwarded to the integer conversion from the original string. Then all copies and references are dead and the allocation itself can be eliminated. LuaJIT will get all of that string handling extravaganza with the v2.1 branch -- parts of the new buffer handling are already in the git repo. I'm sure the v8 guys have something up their sleeves, too.<p>I/O read buffer: Same reasoning. The read creates a temporary buffer which is lazily interned to a string, ditto for the lstrip. The interning is sunk, the copies are sunk, the buffer is sunk (the innermost buffer is reused). This turns it into something very similar to the C code.<p>Pre-sizing aggregates: The size info can be backpropagated to the aggreagate creation from scalar evolution analysis. SCEV is already in LuaJIT (for ABC elimination). I ditched the experimental backprop algorithm for 2.0, since I had to get the release out. Will be resurrected in 2.1.<p>Missing APIs: All of the above examples show you don't really need to define new APIs to get the desired performance. Yes, there's a case for when you need low-level data structures -- and that's why higher-level languages should have a good FFI. I don't think you need to burden the language itself with these issues.<p>Heuristics: Well, that's what those compiler textbooks don't tell you: VMs and compilers are 90% heuristics. Better deal with it rather than fight it.<p>tl;dr: The reason why X is slow, is because X's implementation is slow, unoptimized or untuned. Language design just influences how hard it is to make up for it. There are no excuses.<p></quote><p>Also interesting is his research on allocation sinking:<p><a href=""http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization</a>",1362226717

From comments on TFA:<p>= = = = =<p>The reason behind this stupid expensive solution: It seems that the lightning connector is similar to the thunderbolt connector idea.<p>With USB you have Power/USB/MHL output. Each method requires a specific combination of pins. Updating to a different protocol, support for other devices requires difficult pin sharing (thus hardware modification), support for currently unknown future connections is impossible. If in the future something new appears it wont work with older USB devices.<p>With lightning you can connect anything. Similar to thunderbolt it does not use a specific protocol to handle a specific task. It uses a general method to communicate between adapter and iOS device. That way Apple can send anything through this lightning adapter. The adapter itself gets updated automatically because it loads its firmware from the used device. So Apple can send USB2.0, USB3.0, Analog audio, Digital Audio, HDMI and any new standard through it, in theory.<p>The idea is great: The lightning adapter will be Apples only port and it will remain future proof.<p>In reality however, the lightning connector also has a limited bandwidth thus they have to compress their data, the conversion to and from the Apple lightning protocol requires lots of processing power, on both sides, and reduces quality. And finally its expensive.<p>Apple should have tried to use thunderbolt instead of their own propietary technology, but then they would have used a common technology which other manufacturers could use and benefit from, too, thats not the way Apple likes it, so they introduced their own thing, which is crap right now.<p>AND:<p>Just remember, this is v1 hardware for a tough future proofing problem. I genuinely appreciate the lengths Apple went through to create A) a reversible plug, so you can stop mashing and flipping. B) handled all the connector options.\nThe built in decoder module could take a compatible 1080p video stream and push that to the TV at full resolution, the screen mirroring is a separate protocol. Now Im curious if the Lightning-SVGA adapter has the same rig!<p>So, v1 of the Lightning connector is probably (assuming) going at USB2 speeds. In v2 of the connector we could see USB3 (5Gbit/s) or thunderbolt (10Gbit/s) speeds, but all the accessories still work.<p>Assuming the faster speeds come, itll support 4K TV output video streams, same plug. Yay future.",1362226015

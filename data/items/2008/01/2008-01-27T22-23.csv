If you don't believe me, just google for porn.<p>I am not saying that women's minds are not wired for startups/maths/whatever (I don't know), but the cultural differences are rooted in biological differences. Women have babies, which is very costly. Hence they need a different mindset (more responsibility, time to take care of kids etc.), they are also very valuable to men, so they can sell their bodies as baby-making machines rather than do startups. Different options in life create different paths... Men have to do something impressive to convince women to carry their babies, hence the startup thing (high risk, but if success, there will be babies).",1201474680

105166,comment,105034,105034,0,0,bokonist,,,"Exeter's actually worse than the article says.  Shortly after I graduated in 2002 they tore up up perfectly functional squash courts and replaced them with new ones.  The old courts   weren't as big as the new prep school official size, so they spent millions of dollars just to add another foot to the court.  The money for the project was donated by the father of a girl on the squash team.  He wanted the money to go to bigger squash courts and nothing else.  It's his money, so he can do what he wants with it. But I can make a long, long list of more worthy causes, and it's a shame that bigger squash courts is the best he could do.  Prep schools and colleges manage to own a portion of your identity, and they are incredibly effective at getting alums to donate money back to them.",1201473514

I do. I can tell you categorically that they most definitely without a doubt are 'wired' differently. Regardless of what you do. Treat them absolutely identically. Even before they have outside influences. Before they start nursery/school. Before society/friends influence them. They act very differently indeed. I didn't get that before I had kids. I thought girls liked dolls because people give girls dolls. They don't. It's a reflex. It's how they're built. Just like boys love cars and doing outside stuff.<p>I seriously don't know what else to say here if you think men and womens brains are identical and work the same.",1201472700

105154,comment,104919,105146,0,0,curi,,,"I'm not <i>trying</i> to blame anyone, but I believe the <i>truth of the matter</i> is that it is caused by culture. I believe the truth is that boys are girls are not wired differently, and their brains do not work differently.<p>One reason to question the notion of specialized hardware (brains) for boys and girls is the concept of universality. The easiest, by far, way to be able to do many computations, is to create a computer that can do <i>all</i> computations. Similarly, the easiest way by far to create a system capable of creating a variety of kinds of knowledge, is to create one capable of creating <i>any</i> knowledge.<p>One reason to believe culture would be behind these kinds of differences is we know that our culture transmits vast quantities of knowledge to children. Far more information than is in DNA, just in terms of bits. But also in terms of importance. We also know our culture believes boys and girls are different, and treats people different for many reasons.",1201471764

105151,comment,104977,105016,0,0,ltratt,,,"I might be the only person here who disagrees in some way with this. I noticed that myself and other people I know only started developing RSI-type symptoms after computers got ""fast enough"". By that I mean that before that point there were frequent long-ish pauses when one couldn't do anything very much; at a certain point computers got so fast that such pauses became uncommon, and now it only really happens to me when I switch the machine on and wait for it boot and login.<p>The problem is that pauses are recovery time for your body. The good news is that once you've realised this, you can artificially introduce pauses into your routine, and give your body the chance to repair some of the damage caused by typing. I had big problems when I was a mere 21, and didn't use a computer for several months. With reading around, a bit of common sense, and a very gradual return to things, I not only got back to where I was, but now I use a computer and play guitar more than I did before. Getting better equipment is part of it (for me keyboard: <a href=""http://maltron.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maltron.com/</a> and a trackball: Logitech Trackman Wheel my preferred option), but the two most important things for me were: taking action as soon (i.e. on the day) I noticed problems; and taking breaks when doing things like typing. After a while you won't even notice the breaks are part of your routine.",1201471434

Taxation could be done digitally, of course.<p>If the primary goal is to affect public policy on a global scale, there&#x27;s nothing preventing a &quot;crowd-sourced lobbying organization&quot; from being established.<p>Call it a government if you want, but for a lot of people the main things that government does for them is maintain infrastructure and protect public safety.

The syntax will be different: side effects will be modeled as implicit evidence. But the semantis will be largely the same I believe.<p>I seem to remember that the default will be that if no side effects are declared that any side effect is assumed. At least that was the idea in Rytz&#x27; PhD thesis. The reason for this was pragmatics: the only effect system in a main stream language is Javas checked exceptions. And for that the communis opinio ended up being that the idea is right but having to declare exceptions in intermediary layers of the call graph was not worth the effort. 
That&#x27;s why f.i. Anders Hjelberg left checked exceptions out off C#. 
So getting the usability right is extremely important for a widely adopted effect system.<p>Btw there are a lot of publications around 2012 on the topic of effect systems.<p><a href=""http://lrytz.flavors.me/#publications-talks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lrytz.flavors.me/#publications-talks</a>",1440723411

It did not.</i><p>* And: <i>The only factor that did [affect the likelihood of successful reproduction] was the strength of the original effect — that is, the most robust findings tended to remain easily detectable, if not necessarily as strong.</i><p>* Finally: <i>The project’s authors write that, despite the painstaking effort to duplicate the original research, there could be differences in the design or context of the reproduced work that account for the different findings. Many of the original authors certainly agree.</i><p>* According to several experts, there is no reason to think the problems are confined to psychology, and it could be worse in other fields.

But if you&#x27;re going to be part of an organization, at some point you need to learn how to be constantly valuable.<p>But that is not necessarily the same thing as being constantly productive. There are other ways to contribute value to a team and, for that matter, other ways to structure your work so that you do harder stuff while feeling more up to it. Macros, metaprogramming, other tooling, all that stuff can be very useful for packing work into your useful moments and benefitting from it later (but can be an excessive timesink too, so watch out).<p>Sometimes you&#x27;re not up to coding but you can put together an architectural plan for the next task in line. And to be honest, if you get very good at coding you may find that your hour of high-quality work in a day is enough to keep you employed because it has as much/more impact than someone else&#x27;s four hours of mediocre work. I&#x27;m not even talking 10x programmer here, just that most good code is written in jumps and spurts, maybe capped off with a &quot;holy crap the groove&quot; all day session or three.<p>But the thing is, at some point you&#x27;ll have a crunch deadline that won&#x27;t accommodate the fact that you&#x27;re not very useful that day. And early on, you&#x27;re definitely going to be leaning more on the consistency of your beginner/intermediate work than anything. And no matter what, you always have to keep relationships going with your coworkers. The social/political aspect of software engineering is a pretty big deal in most companies. It&#x27;s not something you necessarily notice when things go well, but you&#x27;ll sure as hell notice when it doesn&#x27;t. Depression hits that <i>hard</i>.<p>Overall, I think you&#x27;ve gotten some good advice here, though I will say as someone who has dealt with similar issues in the past, freelancing will require an extra level of self-discipline to pull yourself back onto the rails after an episode.

M is a set of machines, N is number of replicas we want to have. Now at any given time we write to the N machines that respond fastest.

I looked at some micro benchmarks that Rust did poorly on, and listened to some chatter, and this is some of what I saw:<p>1. Alioth&#x27;s Regex DNA: this was one of Rust&#x27;s worst in the benchmark game. The author (burntsushi) of the Regex library being used (written in Rust) hypothesized that it was because of the algorithm the lib used. He worked on it, and now Rust performs excellently on that benchmark.<p>2. Alioth&#x27;s n-body: the fast implementations are directly using SIMD. In Rust that is currently on an active path towards stabilization.<p>3. A networking micro benchmark -- I lost the link here, but the Rust implementation made the simple mistake of allocation a large array by pushing one element at a time to an initially empty dynamic array. Rust compared well after the fix.<p>4. Rust&#x27;s buffered reader zeros it&#x27;s internal buffer, and its default buffer size is [was?] pretty large. This made some IO operations pretty slow without manually tuning the buffer size, and still left some amount of overhead after tuning. In the Reddit thread where this complaint was brought up someone announced a pull (since merged) to significantly reduce the zeroing overhead.<p>I found these examples encouraging, except for the last. The former are regular growing pains of any language ecosystem and benchmark implementation. Only the last looked like an issue where Rust&#x27;s design might cause a measurable run time cost. In all cases it was cool seeing people tackle the issues and get a good speedup. Worth mentioning is that although Rust&#x27;s benchmark game results are still behind C&#x27;s, they are now in a similar ballpark with C++&#x27;s.<p>[1] <a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php?test=regexdna"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php...</a> , <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3b2i0f/psa_regex_is_now_slower_than_regexnew/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3b2i0f/psa_regex_is_n...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3i85lg/simd_in_rust/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3i85lg/simd_in_rust/</a> , <a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php?test=nbody"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3cgaui/trying_to_find_why_python_is_twice_as_fast_as/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3cgaui/trying_to_find...</a><p>[Rust/C++] <a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=rust&lang2=gpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lan...</a>",1440720253

The squat and the deadlift, properly performed, are the most important lifts _any_ human being – young or old, male or female – can do. And a person _does not_ need to go heavy on either of these to realize tremendous benefits in their day-to-day life. Spending 6 weeks to get up to a 135x5x1 deadlift (bar + big plates for 1 set of 5 reps) – and then just doing that once a week in perpetuity – would be single most efficient way the average human could improve their daily wellbeing.",1440720092

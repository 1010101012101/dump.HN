10517429,comment,10511063,10516821,0,0,oakwhiz,,,"I would argue that the impact of LTE-U on Wi-Fi is actually greater than that of Wi-Fi on Wi-Fi, despite what you have pointed out. It is true that LTE-U operates on a fair time-share basis (TDMA [1]), however the problem here is that LTE-U unfairly transmits while Wi-Fi stations are transmitting, giving absolutely no regard to the actual channel usage by Wi-Fi stations. Wi-Fi does not work on a time-share basis, it operates on a &quot;don&#x27;t talk while I&#x27;m talking&quot; basis, and since TDMA is a different way of communicating, Wi-Fi stations don&#x27;t know how to avoid collisions with LTE-U stations. From the perspective of a Wi-Fi station, an LTE-U station is just like a leaky microwave oven, there is no way to avoid radio collisions with it.<p>There isn&#x27;t a way for Wi-Fi stations to know what TDMA time slots are &quot;free,&quot; how long those time slots are, and there isn&#x27;t a way for Wi-Fi networks to &quot;sign up&quot; for a time slot with the TDMA networks. The TDMA networks just decide to talk at some predefined interval without consulting the Wi-Fi networks to see when they would like to talk. This does not sound fair to me - it&#x27;s kind of like saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to yell very loudly once every minute. If it interrupts the conversation that you are trying to have then too bad for you. But I&#x27;m not going to yell when my friends are yelling, because we have an agreement in place.&quot;<p>Normally, Wi-Fi stations use CSMA/CA [2] to avoid transmitting when other Wi-Fi stations are transmitting, which overall reduces the number of lost Wi-Fi frames for everybody. This is what I mean by &quot;don&#x27;t talk while I&#x27;m talking.&quot; So the impact of Wi-Fi on Wi-Fi is materially lower than the impact of LTE-U on Wi-Fi simply from a statistical standpoint.<p>In addition, LTE-U only transmits when it detects other Wi-Fi transmitters. However, due to the hidden node problem [3], not all Wi-Fi stations that are using the channel can necessarily be detected by an LTE-U station, but the LTE-U station is still able to interfere with them. So there will be some quiet Wi-Fi stations that the LTE-U station can&#x27;t see at all, and when the LTE-U station decides the channel is mostly empty and blasts its signal there, the quiet Wi-Fi station will be disproportionately overcome with interference. Again, the interference would be TDMA interference, but the Wi-Fi access points would not know how or when to avoid TDMA collisions, so the interference would be worse than Wi-Fi interference.<p>Normally, with Wi-Fi and CSMA/CA, the gaps in the louder station&#x27;s transmissions would be good opportunities for the quieter station to start transmitting, allowing them to sometimes take turns even though the louder station cannot hear the quieter station, and the hidden node problem would be mitigated as best as CSMA/CA is capable of doing so. But with TDMA interference, there isn&#x27;t any cue that Wi-Fi can take which indicates that now is a good time to transmit without interference.<p>This could all be avoided if LTE-U didn&#x27;t solely operate on a TDMA basis, but also ceased transmitting (or skipped time slots) while Wi-Fi networks are transmitting.<p>LTE-U risks starting or worsening a &quot;loudness war&quot; where other unlicensed spectrum users decide to buy louder and louder unlicensed equipment up to (and possibly past) the legal limit, because their networks are unusable with too much interference otherwise.<p>Combine this design decision with the interest that wireless telecommunications companies have preferring their LTE networks over the well-being of Wi-Fi networks, and it starts to paint a sinister picture - that telecommunications companies might be attempting to deliberately interfere with unlicensed Wi-Fi networks in order to promote their own networks and equipment as being superior.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_division_multiple_access"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_division_multiple_access</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_node_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_node_problem</a>",1446774939

10517414,comment,10516963,10516963,0,0,keeringplastik,,,"I went through the same process this past year: my job had gotten to the point that the most challenging part was trying to accept the level of dysfunction that had become so entrenched. I was in my chosen field, getting to work on the exact thing I wanted to work on. However I could not shake the feeling that the organization could give two shits about my actual performance, and really just wanted a seat-warming sycophant. I had been in this position for almost three years, and all the economics (profit sharing, benefits, etc. ) were favorable.<p>Leaving a &quot;good&quot; job is not easy, even when you have another &quot;good&quot; job lined up.<p>Luckily my wife gave me an out in the form of becoming the stay at home dad for some time while she became the breadwinner. It&#x27;s a tighter budget, but doable. It also aligns with our desire to avoid having to resort to daycare for our very young children.<p>I did not really want to leave just as I was moving onto the work I really wanted but the nagging feeling was still there: do I really want to hitch my cart to this drunk pony?<p>My solution was to do the things I was specifically directed, but to get those out of the way as fast as possible, as opposed to the usual milking it out and &quot;looking busy&quot; until the next task came by (this was common between large projects). With the rest of my time I dug deep into the things I believed were the most critical to the company, were related directly to my position, and were also problems I could solve. Without getting into too much detail, I sought to improve some of the processes that were either outdated, outright wrong or maddeningly cumbersome/tedious.<p>I did this for about six months in a few different areas I was involved: systems modeling, database management, and radiant heat transfer were the three that I focused. I wrote some simple proposals, some mock-ups of what I was building and presented it to my superiors.<p>The response was utterly unsurprising given the the track record of the company: &quot;we have always done things this way&quot;, &quot;it has always worked fine so far&quot;, &quot; we need that cumbersome software because someday, it might prevent an expensive mistake&quot;, &quot;I make the decisions and am responsible so you just need to accept these practices and move on&quot; etc. I pointedly asked my boss (the chief engineer) if he had any questions, anything, about one of my proposals (maybe 25 pages long) and the answer was a flat &quot;no&quot;.<p>That was the last straw. If my best work was going to be so curtly dismissed, I would rather change diapers all day.<p>Granted, I was being one of those &quot;if I was in charge this is how I would do it&quot; types, but I was A: putting it in detailed written form, and B: confining my proposals only to what applied directly to my job. It wasn&#x27;t water cooler bitching, and it wasn&#x27;t about telling anyone else how they should do their job.<p>Don&#x27;t cope with an unsatisfying job any longer than you have to. My advice: decide for yourself what you can do for your company, and then do it (enlist your fellow drones of you can). If your boss/employer (go as high as you feel comfortable) does not at the very least recognize your work ethic, tell them to shove it.<p>TL;DR It feels great to leave a sinking ship after you tried, and were told not, to fix the hole.",1446774749

If you&#x27;re going to do it regularly, it&#x27;s worth looking up &#x27;-a&#x27;. If you want to do something unusual it takes a minute or so looking up the command&#x27;s help. Whereas on the GUI if you want to do something unusual, the answer is generally &quot;whelp, sorry, learn CLI peasant you just can&#x27;t do it since I didn&#x27;t anticipate your weird need and spend time rendering a menu choice and 4 interface screens with click boxes so you wouldn&#x27;t have to type anything&quot;.<p>If GUIs had as many options as command line programs did they would be completely unusable trash, with an enormous unintelligible control panel, and you&#x27;d be looking iconography up in a reference manual instead of switches (have fun designing all those icons and having different ones express different subtle alterations in how a command will execute)<p>There are a lot of options because the tools are flexible and capable of expressing MUCH more than a GUI. I&#x27;ll give you there are some consistency issues, but they are historical not fundamental to the CLI. I&#x27;m honestly surprised someone hasn&#x27;t written a wrapper to standardize every app in a shell so they all use the same format (ie have a &#x27;one true format&#x27; for argument passing and just convert as necessary for every CLI app, parsing their manpages as they are installed if necessary), it wouldn&#x27;t be very difficult. It never occured to me (or anyone else likely) because it just isn&#x27;t a problem. You try to use a program one time, it doesn&#x27;t work the way you expect, you look it up, it takes 4 seconds, if you use it a couple more times then you just know.<p>Scripts don&#x27;t run away from the command line, they embrace it . Scripts are the reason you use the command line; it&#x27;s just text, so once you can do something once you can do it as many times as you want and share it with others instantly. Have you seen a macro to automate a GUI process? That moves the mouse around and clicks on stuff? And breaks constantly? Probably not, because nobody uses them.<p>Once you get into a command that&#x27;s long enough to type into a file you&#x27;ve already written a program and sure if it&#x27;s worth saving people will save it. The CLI blends using a machine and programming it and IMO that&#x27;s a good thing -- it promotes literacy instead of encouraging people to point and grunt at shiny menu boxes and to refuse to learn how their machine actually works. If you&#x27;re doing research and your main tool is a computer, it pays to learn how it works. It&#x27;s not exciting but it&#x27;s the same in every field. If you want to become an expert you need to understand your tools on a deep level.",1446773105

Then something seemed to change. Rather than just being a great payment provider, they seemed to change direction in order to become a &quot;platform&quot;.<p>In emailing with Sahil about my concerns about Gumroad&#x27;s new direction, he said &quot;We want Gumroad to be the core channel for everything. We started with sales, and are moving into audience/list management.&quot;<p>He made it clear that they want me to import my audience lists to Gumroad and that they don&#x27;t plan to support future integrations with CampaignMonitor, Mailchimp, etc. That makes sense, since those email platforms are now the competition I guess. It&#x27;s bad news for me though - if I wanted to stay with Gumroad, I&#x27;d now have a project on my hands to move everything over to a (currently) much less powerful email platform.<p>I imagine this will work for many of their customers, but there are customers like myself that don&#x27;t want to be pushed in this direction. I prefer to keep my audience management  separate from my payment provider. I don&#x27;t want my payment provider deciding that my customers are now their customers that they can now spam and upsell them in order to grow their platform. I&#x27;m not saying that that is Gumroad&#x27;s plan - but I&#x27;m increasingly worried that it might be. Particularly if they get in a &quot;desperate for growth&quot; situation like this article hints at.<p>Again, they&#x27;ve been great for years and I really appreciate that. The new direction just seems too risky and not a good fit for folks like me who don&#x27;t want their payment provider as the middle-man for communicating with their audience.<p>I guess there&#x27;s an argument that they&#x27;re not a payment provider, but a &quot;sales platform&quot; or something.<p>Currently I&#x27;m looking for a replacement payment provider (or whatever they should be called) to use.

The text also includes provisions limiting the ability of countries to keep data within their territorial borders.<p>… any legal system that imposes limits on private sector data transfers to jurisdictions for the purpose of safeguarding citizens’ data against foreign government intelligence agencies, as was recently accomplished by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Schrems v Facebook Inc, 2015 Case C-362/14, could contribute to violation of Section A of the TPP’s Investment chapter and be subject to sanction and heavy penalties through the investor-state dispute mechanism.<p>… Article 14.17 prevents governments from requiring the disclosure of source code as a condition of import, distribution, sale or use of software or of products containing software … while the Article excludes disclosure obligations in commercially negotiated contracts, it does not exempt source code disclosure provisions imposed by means of a software license.<p>… As open source licenses are not ‘commercially negotiated’ but rather imposed on others, there is concern that any attempt to enforce such licenses against third parties by means of the courts would amount to a violation of this Article, opening the country whose court system carried out such enforcement to heavy-handed penalties through the investor-state dispute enforcement mechanisms.<p>… addressing cybersecurity breaches can require mandating the publication of source code so as to facilitate fixing of security flaws.

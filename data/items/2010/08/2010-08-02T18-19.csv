1568607,comment,1568494,1568494,0,0,tptacek,,,"I've got karma to burn, so I'll just point out that Daniel Ellsburg is not, in fact, an authority on the impact or ethics of this Wikileaks dump. Counterintuitive as it may sound, Daniel Ellsburg is not actually qualified to judge whether Wikileaks did the same thing for AfPak that Ellsburg himself did for Vietnam.<p>The Pentagon Papers showed the war in Southeast Asia to have been an outright lie, and one to which the administration had resigned itself to losing but was feeding troops into in an attempt to extricate itself ""gracefully"". It exposed overtly illegal activities on a <i>strategic</i> scale, such as the widespread bombing of Cambodia and Laos, which the government had previously disavowed. The Pentagon Papers impacted the standing of the administration on a policy level.<p>Anybody on Hacker News can compose an argument that suggests that somewhere in the Wikileaks dump is information that would expose:<p>* strategic decisions to expand the AfPak conflict (say, continuous coordinated airstrikes into Baluchistan)<p>* strategic acceptance of defeat in AfPak and a decision to make a face-saving retreat at the expense of American lives<p>* the notion that we occupied Afghanistan for reasons other than the elimination of the Taliban (for instance, to grab resources, or to counter a resurgent Iran)<p>But so far, <i>no such information has been turned up</i>. Instead, we have the meme that ""the Wikileaks dump is like the Pentagon Papers in their raw original form"". But we don't know that. For that to be true, they would need to paint a clear picture of a shocking distinction between reality and the ongoing narrative of the conflict; we'd have to be secretly at war with Pakistan or Iran, or already resigned to letting the Taliban reclaim the country, or something at that scale.<p>Furthermore, the Pentagon Papers and the Wikileaks dump aren't ethically equivalent. Ellsburg leaked 4,100 pages of digested intelligence and policy information. Wikileaks dumped 70,000 documents taken directly from field reports. Wikileaks claims to have ""minimized harm"" (presumably by scrubbing names from reports or withholding documents they believed would have exposed people to harm). Ellsburg didn't have to take responsibility for avoiding that kind of harm; the NVA probably could not have organized death squads to react to his disclosure.<p>Has this happened already in Afghanistan? Nobody has provided evidence that it has, but it seems pretty clear that it's a real risk. Death squads don't care about due process. All they need is a town, a time, and a rough description.<p>All this, as usual, is not meant to say that the US Government is on the ""right side"" of this issue. For one (obvious) thing, none of this information should have been available, to anybody; negligence in DoD information assurance makes them just as culpable for deaths of outed informants.<p>But I'm still left wondering: if you don't draw the line at a decent (tens of % points) chance at outing (and thus killing) an informant in Afghanistan while you're sitting behind a laptop in a safe western country, where do you draw the line? Is there any line at all?",1280775406

People like Schweitzer who are already entrenched may try to keep the custom everything model, but there are serious efforts to at the very least use a single standard stack.  Big pushes for 61850 in the substation and a common wide area solution for utility-utility and utility-reginal coordinator communications are happening right now.<p>They may be somewhat custom, but they are more cots/standardized than previously.

Trying and failing for a PhD is hugely expensive in opportunity cost. Trying, succeeding, and depending on a faculty post on the other end to make it all worthwhile can be pretty dangerous, too.<p>A lot of us in the 15-35 age range have been force-fed the idea growing up that encouragement is automatically good, regardless, and the entrepreneur community can be especially prone to this because you need a lot of drive to be an entrepreneur. I actually think that's ok for entrepreneurship, because the worst case isn't really <i>all</i> that bad unless you are really stupid. (Incorporate early, incorporate often; don't take on debt personally.) You at least get some very valuable experience. That's not true for everything. Getting your PhD is one of those things; a partial PhD is not worth it. I would be appalled if I encouraged someone to get their PhD and turned out to be that little tipping factor, only for them to find two years in that they are miserable and can't finish. If anything, a little light discouragement is what is really called for; if that's enough to turn you away from a PhD, then good! You were in trouble anyhow.<p>Life advice is serious business and unthinkingly spouting ""common sense"" can be very destructive.<p>But typing all this out is certainly less... pithy.",1280775247
1568596,comment,1568468,1568468,0,0,jff,,,"Ok, so we see that only 9% of women who apply for VC get it. Then we hear about how startups run by women do so much better than those run by men. Now, suppose the reason so few women get VC is because the male VCs are less disposed to give women money--and those who do get money are those who provided such a fantastic plan that it was a <i>clear</i> winner. Since this essentially makes the entrance criteria harder, you'd expect that those few enterprises which make it through are going to do extremely well... something along the lines of all those uber-startups run by women.<p>I'm not saying women can't make good companies, I'm just saying that the implied bias on the part of male VCs would tend to select only the very best woman-founded startups. Level the playing field, and you'll probably get the same performance as men.",1280775244

It's just this: all of the author's claims in that section are backed by statistics.

0) Hard to do a PhD part-time. Consider ""retiring"" for a while.<p>1) Your advisor will be focused on cranking out publications to advance their career. Not always the same as increasing the amount of knowledge in the world. You might be viewed as free labor in this effort. Protect yourself.<p>2) Your advisor will not help you manage your time or set goals. In fact they might need help in this area themselves.<p>3) If you haven't been in school lately, or deep into work related to your topic, expect to spend a lot of time ""getting the rust out"". Painful but useful.<p>4) The younger brain can solve problems more quickly, the older brain can pick better problems to solve. Your advisors won't know this either.<p>5) A storied career in academia is unlikely for an older student. (See Robin Milner for a great exception.) Keep your business network alive and growing <i>the entire time you are in school</i>.<p>6) The #1 goal is to finish. OK to repeat that to yourself over and over. Your thesis need not be the last word on a topic to be acceptable or even good.<p>7) You will feel like an idiot every day until you suddenly realize nobody can answer your questions anymore. That day you should start writing the answers in your thesis and finish it asap.<p>Finally, other than all the pain and anguish, it is an invigorating experience to find the brain still working.",1280774693

There were, I believe, at least 4 talks on it at Black Hat this year. Every software security consultancy in the country has done multiple projects targeting ""smart grid"" components in general and automated metering (AMI) in particular.<p>Smart grid components are interesting to me not because they're a vector for flashy (and horrific) real-world attacks, but because they demand a different strategy for mitigating attacks.<p>In conventional software, dev teams can rely on a ""get it right and then patch what breaks"" approach. While updating software is notoriously difficult, it is at least a plausible response to a serious security flaw.<p>When you deploy 100,000 smart meters running RTOS's on TI microcontrollers, this strategy doesn't work. Anything straightforward you do to make those meters feasible to update is going to blow up in your face. And this is an extremely unforgiving place to deploy security countermeasures; you face not only strict code-size limits on the meters themselves, but also RF protocols that need to squeeze every bit out of every message.<p>I think the winning strategy for the ""smart grid"" is, like Blu-Ray, renewability. Instead of trying to train 500 microcontroller realtime C devs in secure code and crypto protocols, people should sit down and devise mechanisms to recover from security flaws. Things as simple as protocol versioning, or the ability to shun/revoke specific devices, or the ability to fault to manual reads are like to make a bigger difference than whether the devices are using truncated SHA1 vs. SHA256.",1280773925

I love writing, I do it all the time, but in terms of blogging I have one big problem: Too many interests!<p>If I had one blog, its subject matter would span video games, fencing, martial arts, armchair philosophy, ruby, python, Android & iPhone development, vim tips, some of my own illustration, general software development, personal finance, microfiction, graphic design and Photoshop tips.  Now, I know we're supposed to write a blog even if no one is going to read it, because it is its own reward; but I feel like there really isn't a point to publishing a blog unless you think <i>someone</i> out there is going to visit regularly.  Otherwise, there just isn't a reason to make it public--right?<p>My question to you fine ladies and gentlemen is: What should I do?  ""Wing it"" and put up an interdisciplinary blog, trusting that it'll get an appropriate audience (whether an audience of ten or ten thousand)?  Create a whole bunch of blogs and update each of them less frequently?  I haven't spent too much time fretting over this, because it's probably more important to actually get things done, but that frontpage article last week inspired me to really find a solution, because it really bugs me when I write something and have no place to put it.<p>What do you think?",1280773549

This is partially true, but to the point the make it.<p>* A general distrust of power grid engineers (including software) of anyone claiming that ""evil hackers are everywhere"". They don't understand certain software issues, like once an exploit is found it is essentially free to take advantage of, which is the exact opposite of may real-life security issues.<p>* Utilities that view security as a matter of procedural compliance with some set of rules.<p>These combine for a bleak picture, the tempering tho comes from:<p>* vendors and regulators (doe, nerc, ferc) are very concerned with security at all levels.<p>* researchers are starting to show how real, physical damage can be caused by cyber-security problems (not just hypothetical, but demonstrable, bottom line affecting issues).<p>* recognition by the more pragmatic older engineers that today's ""kids"" are maybe on to something using commodity communications and software instead of custom everything. This has inherent security benefits in many places.<p>All that being said, this is a giant field, and the ""smart grid"" is not one thing (in fact, if you have n people talking about it, (n-1)^2 definitions of smart grid will usually emerge) -- security for the grid is an exciting and interesting place to be.",1280773547

Buy an app on the web and it's pushed to the phone.<p>I imagine that if done right this would allow them to match Apple in terms of providing more real estate for promotional content from app developers, and reduce the barrier to buying since you can preview an app, hit ""buy,"" and immediately have it on the phone.<p>I also think the lack of a good web presence for Android Market is holding back device adoption.  I know of several people who are dissatisfied with their iPhones but are hesitant to jump to Android without being able to see if there are third-party apps out there that are analogous to what they've already got on their iPhones.<p>I agree that one of the major problems with the Android Market at present is certainly this culture of ""I won't pay for an app -- and if I have to pay, I'll copy it to my SD card and delete it within the 24 hour return window.""  A developer has little incentive to make a really, really good paid app if a good proportion of their users would pirate it.

InfiniBand QDR can transfer 40Gbit/sec with 1µsec latency. That's easily 200,000 synchronous round-trip messages per second PER link. If you can deal with higher latency, those can be aggregated and you can easily exchange tens of millions per second. Let's take this one step further: ECNs and automated trading systems. Their latency and I/O requirements make banks look like amateurs, yet they almost entirely run on off-the-shelf hardware and systems. Billions are at stake in these systems.<p>2) When was the last time Google or Amazon or NASDAQ or Arca was actually out of service because of hardware failure or maintenance?",1280772310

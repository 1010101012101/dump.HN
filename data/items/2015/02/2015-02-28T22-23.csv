But it seems rather straightforward to figure out the actual implementation that&#x27;s commonly called and inline it, perhaps with a guard for uncommon cases.

However this is based on the assumption that the voltage spacing is exactly the same for every increment in the sample word -- and this is simply not going to be true in the real world.<p>This applies to both axes: at 44.1kHz, no clock tick is going to be precisely equally spaced from every other.<p>In other words, every A/D and D/A process is introducing non-linear behaviour and thus artefacts that change according to the actual input, as a concern quite outside that of the noise floor or the Nyquist limit.<p>Increasing the bit depth and sample rate helps reduce the effects of such non-linearities.",1425164320

At the same time, Thunderbird developed an infuriating habit of matching apparently arbitrary entries in my address book that had the letters I&#x27;m typing in there somewhere, with no logical priority order that I have been able to determine, and certainly not prioritising an address that exactly matches what I&#x27;m typing over half a dozen others that don&#x27;t really look much like what I&#x27;m typing but apparently match according to whatever heuristics they are now using.<p><i>When auto-complete shows multiple options, arrow down till you come to the correct one and then hit the Tab key.

One reason they are contested is that many of them have come into being through measurements and statistics that effectively define illness as a deviation from a norm rather than as an underlying pathology. Just as type II diabetes is now defined by elevated blood-glucose levels (rather than a set of symptoms), the Body Mass Index (BMI) clinically diagnoses obesity as a larger than average (or what used to be average) weight-to-height ratio. It does not actually measure adiposity; in fact, a high BMI can be the result of large amounts of bone or muscle as easily as fat. Meanwhile, IQ has long been under attack as a culturally biased and non-objective way to measure intelligence.<p>Type II diabetes: does the author not believe a disease can be present before noticeable symptoms?<p>Obesity: the shortfalls of BMI are well-known; I doubt there are a lot of doctors out there who see an athlete with a high BMI and think, &quot;time to burn some of that muscle&quot;<p>Brain damage: the author is attacking their own choice of metric for the condition, in order to... deny the condition&#x27;s existence??",1425162706

Thunderbird&#x27;s per-folder metadata indices are stored in a weird texty append-only database format known as &quot;mork&quot; that you may have heard of, usually preceded or followed by some cursing.  The file must be read completely into memory, and in many cases this ends up synchronously happening on the main thread.  The upside to this is that the thread-pane is very fast and allows sorting on all columns, etc.  Right-clicking on a folder and choosing &quot;compact&quot; will trigger compaction of the mork database as well as the offline cache (a per-folder mbox-style file where the downloaded messages are stored).<p>* Not leveraging Thunderbird&#x27;s offline storage and proactive syncing of messages.  If you bring up the account settings for the account, and look at the &quot;Synchronization & Settings&quot; tab, you want &quot;Keep messages for this account on this computer&quot; checked.  You also want checkboxes by folders you care about in the list that pops up when you click the &quot;Advanced...&quot; button.  With these enabled, Thunderbird will proactively download the message bodies to your computer, making them available for both offline access and rapid message display.<p>Note that if you only launch Thunderbird when you want to read your mail and immediately close it when done reading, you won&#x27;t be getting much benefit from this and things may even go slower as you fight Thunderbird playing catch-up with your mail.<p>* You have a lot of of messages in the folders in question.  The message file loading is O(messages) and so is sync without CONDSTORE enabled.  (Thunderbird&#x27;s CONDSTORE implementation regrettably has some bugs and was turned off recently.  See <a href=""https://bugzil.la/912216"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzil.la/912216</a>)  Additionally, gmail&#x27;s IMAP implementation can take some time to open an IMAP folder with a lot of messages because it needs to build a sequence number mapping and do other stuff.",1425161132

We know that they are highly sensitive in some frequency ranges, and that sensitivity includes higher temporal impulse precision than is required, such as the 300-3khz band used for human speech.<p>As in, for some frequency bands, our &quot;sampling rate&quot; (if such a thing could be applied apples to apples in human hearing) is higher than in others. I suspect this may be related to our ability to localize 3D perfectly sound with only two ears.<p>Not only that, but also in some frequency bands, we can detect finer differences in sound level than 16 bit can describe.<p>So no, 16 bit/44.1khz probably is not sufficient.<p>Also, you bring up lossy encoding which has no place in this discussion. If you want to discuss how lossy codecs exploit the flaws in hearing to compress audio better, talk about codecs that use wavelets and are highly effective at what they do due to a finely tuned psychoacoustic model, such as exploiting that our &quot;sampling rate&quot; and &quot;bit depth&quot; are non-linear across frequency bands.",1425161129

A song encoded with modern LAME with VBR at around 64k or 96k possibly sounds better than the same song encoded with a napster-era encoder at 192 CBR. Modern formats such as AAC or Vorbis are even more performant than LAME.<p>I don&#x27;t have hard data to back it up, but I think 99% of people would not differentiate between lossless and and lossy with a mid high quality setting (lame at v3-ish, whatever the equivalent is in the best aac encoder these days), even on a great headphone setup.

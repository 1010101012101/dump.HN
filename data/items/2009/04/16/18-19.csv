565652,comment,565479,565611,0,0,briansmith,,,"Trains are not for trips like Philly to Austin. They are for trips between Houston, Austin, and Dallas. In those trips, there is significant overhead to air travel: the time it takes to go to the airport + go through security + take off + climb thousands of feet + descend + land + get your baggage + drive from the airport into the city. The cost to fly these short trips is disproportionate to their distance when compared to longer trips. That is why so most people drive instead.<p>With trains, you reduce/eliminate almost all of that overhead. If you have a train that goes only 120mph between Houston and Austin, you have reduced the travel time from 3.5-4 hours to 1.5 hours each way. That is a huge savings in time that makes a lot of currently-infeasible trips practical.<p>Will it be cheap? Based on my experience riding the trains in Japan, I would say it is going to be much cheaper than flying and more expensive than taking buses and/or slower passenger trains. If the high-speed train people were smart, they'd price it at exactly the price of driving (gas-wise) in the beginning in order to build demand, and then ramp up the price as trains start getting sold out.",1239908393

All the transportation systems we should invest in (and all of them are somewhat subsidized by the government) should be the ideal balance of these tradeoffs for that particular distance range.<p>I believe there is a sweet spot in travel distance where high speed trains are the optimal solution over cars in the smaller distance range and planes in the longer distance range.  Few would think to travel from LA to NY on a train but when you are talking about LA to SF, it makes a lot of sense. Time and destination wise it's more convenient, the environmental impact is less, frees up plane capacity at LAX and SFO for long distance flights, ongoing costs are similar, and the only question remaining is do these benefits outweigh the very large upfront cost? Would love to see how much these costs compare (a new high speed train route vs a hypothetical new airport + enough planes to service the route)",1239907804

There are no direct flights from SF to KFalls, so that means I usually have to fly to Seattle or Portland and then transfer to a smaller commuter which can make trip time almost as long.

Internet Providers want to meter Usage",http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30229181/,"If Internet service providers' current experiments succeed, subscribers may end up paying for high-speed Internet based on how much material they download. Trials with such metered access, rather than the traditional monthly flat fee for unlimited connection time, offer enough bandwidth that they won't affect many consumers — yet.<p>But as more people use the Internet to watch TV and stream movies, they could bump up against the metered rates' caps, paying expensive over-use fees.

565621,comment,565157,565157,0,0,sachmanb,,,"A media studies professor told me that the problem with the Internet was (1) people don't understand how it works so it depowers them further (2) there are a lot of hidden environmental costs (3) quality of information is questionable because everyone can post anything, and (4) everyone thinks everything is a revolution: they thought that about radio, television, etc...how they were going to change our world and didn’t.  Like the author of this article, she pointed to how select large corporations control the infrastructure.\nI responded in a presentation that:<p>(1)	Not everyone needs to know how medicine works in order to benefit from medicine, and it does improve our lives.  It is a good thing that not everyone has to know TCP/IP, or the inner workings of browsers to use them.  Further, unlike many other elements of our society, to learn and get involved in this one is a lot easier.<p>(2)	It’s true that silicon development, and waste from computer equipment is contributing to our environmental problems, and we should fix that, but that is a larger systemic paradigm problem we as a society have and is not specific to this industry<p>(3)	The problem of unreliable information exists with or without the Internet.  That problem is tackled by people organizing who have shared interests, organizing to create certifications, show trust in others, build reputation networks, etc... this is the case outside of the Internet, and it is the case with the Internet as well.<p>(4)	The Internet is not going to be like television or radio, because it is fundamentally different.  Although organizations like the FCC were designed to protect limited air waves from corporate control, they ended up doing the opposite, and even if they were doing a good job there would be a lot of hierarchical control.  What we have on the Internet is something particularly incredible.  The powerful organizations that control the infrastructure needed to build something that worked reliably, for many purposes, and although the reasons for this were originally military and such, what we have is something not hierarchical, something that you can become a node on, something that with very low cost of entry gives you the ability to distribute your content.  Sure, most of this ability is used by many people to maintain their MySpace page, but that they can make it incredibly different.  Further, browsers can modify the content being sent to them, the Internet allows groups of people to create their own communities, and their own sub-networks.<p>Not all of our social problems, that we lie and try and manipulate each other, that we waste a lot of our time, that we produce a lot of a junk ... the Internet doesn’t make these problems disappear, but due to its remarkable difference from other mediums, as you all know, opens many incredible possibilities.\nWhen I did the presentation MIT’s Open Course Ware was still new, I recommended my university follow suite and make classes available in video, they haven’t but other schools have.  Wikipedia is accessible in a lot of languages.  I have been to third world countries, and it is a lot easier going to a cyber-cafe, which there is more so every year, than it is to go to the United States to get a higher education, or purchase books/find a library, and sift through the amount of books that would be needed to get this amount of information.<p>A number of you agree that there is a lot of wrong, and time wasting information on the Internet, but just take a look at the site you’re on - through organization, that giant pool of information is being filtered.  If you follow a link to MIT, you know the quality of the article is going to be better; it builds reputation with you, just as Hacker News gives you a greater feeling of quality than reddit.  We can go further and build reputation systems that can be added as browser plug-ins, community based, or organizations accrediting... we can think of ways of making through lots of information, and even without the Internet we’d have that problem.  Also, it’s unlikely that any time in the near future you’ll be able to go through some information source and just know it’s all right, before the Internet, and continuing into now that it’s here, you have to trust yourself foremost, and learn how not to waste your own time, and value sources that give you information that checks out with you.<p>P.S. Recently at a dinner with a Sociology professor, I got the ‘Internet is going to kill us all’ shpeel again (she didn’t know I worked in the industry), and I’m realizing there’s two sides to this: people who think the internet is going to solve every problem magically (as opposed to being a tool to help us solve those problems), and those who think the Internet is going to destroy the world magically (as opposed to being a tool to help us destroy the world).",1239907426

565594,comment,565085,565158,0,0,briansmith,,,"A single-statement SQL PageRank implementation sounds feasible to me. Most commercial SQL implementations have had hierarchal, ranking, and windowing functions for a while now. They all have XML (maybe HTML?) document parsers in them as well. I think moderately complex hierarchical rankings can be built from those primitives, even as a single SQL statement.<p>The performance of that code and if/how they are parallelized by the system is really a quality-of-implementation issue. If Oracle, Microsoft, or IBM thinks they can make money by implementing automatically parallelized hierarchical ranking and windowing functions, they will do so; maybe some of them have already done so.<p>I share Oracle's philosophy about how abstract SQL should be. Oracle says you should be able to write the same SQL against a small single-instance database that you would write against a giant multi-instance database; the database is responsible for optimizing the performance, not the developer. There are a lot of cases where the theory doesn't match practice with Oracle, but every new release gets the two closer. I wouldn't be surprised to see Oracle surpass general-purpose MapReduce-based approaches in terms of performance soon. And, I am expecting Oracle to release a tool to efficiently run MapReduce-style programs against Oracle (converting them to SQL) any time now.",1239906466

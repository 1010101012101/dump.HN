524639,comment,524630,524630,0,0,cperciva,,,"It's interesting to note that much of the success of large US universities, compared to their European counterparts, has been driven by the fact that American alumni are far more generous than European alumni.  Only about 10% of Oxford alumni make donations to the university, while most US universities have donation rates exceeding 50% -- and Oxford and Cambridge are doing considerably better than their continental counterparts.<p>Whether this is due to US universities being more aggressive in soliciting donations (they are), more willing to allow admissions decisions to be influenced by donations (they are), or simply due to US alumni having more money to throw around (the US has a higher income gap between degree and non-degree holders than Europe) isn't clear; but whatever is causing this difference in donations, it has huge consequences.",1237532263
524638,comment,524314,524314,0,0,alanthonyc,,,"I have slowly been coming to the realization that just as the internet is doing its creative destruction thing on many obvious institutions (book distribution, music distribution, etc.) there are a lot more areas where it applies equally, although much less obviously.<p>Management as a career is one of those areas.  Really, the whole need for managers (especially ""middle"" managers) is to maintain a line of communication between the leader of an organization and its producers/workers.  Doesn't the internet make this type of job obsolete?  In an efficient pipeline (of information), aren't they just bottlenecks?<p>We're certainly not there yet, quite possibly still a long way away, but once we get to the point where dissemination of pertinent information is at maximum efficiency, we won't need these arbiters of information in the system anymore.<p>I think this ties in to PG's thoughts on people not being meant to have a boss (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html</a>) as well as Berners-Lee's talk at TED about getting information onto the internet in as raw a form as possible.",1237532215

Everyone hated the first major redesign too, but now I'm sure everyone's used to it.  They should do a test, wherein they switch the layout back to a previous layout then have people vote.  I have a feeling this would show that the vocal majority would dislike ANY major change.  I'm pretty sure Facebook's team has a lot better designers than any of the 700,000 voters.",1237532071

I'm not a lawyer either but this is very much illegal and you will be deported (and be made ineligible to use the VWP ever again) if found out.<p>You <i>can</i> use the VWP to attend business meetings and certain types of sales calls, warranty repairs, etc.. but actually doing ""work"" (even if not in return for money) is a big no-no.

It's hard to really get a feel for the general economy and what the average Joe wants.<p>Just because <i>I</i> don't buy anything from spam, would never buy food from a roadside stall, click on banner ads all day, or go do drugs or whatever.. doesn't mean the majority of the world isn't doing all that stuff each day :) Once realized, it's a pretty powerful thing.. yes, you can produce some really odd stuff and it will still sell!<p>The underachiever method is really just a market research technique that someone gave a name and made money from. As a market research technique, though, it works. It's just a variation of asking people what they like and then providing that.<p>It's better, though, because you've actually picked up people from Google who, in the main, were <i>ready</i> to buy! (Or at least read what you had to say about a product.) The opinions of these people are far more important than just general opinions from the market. These are folks with problems who are ready to put down cash to read stuff that will help them out.<p>The number of responses is small in a classical market research sense, but that's why it's usually done in a very small niche. 50-100 responses to, say, ""Why do you want to learn French?"" are going to provide enough of an indication of the general market groups.. expats living in France who want jobs, kids at home doing homework, rich guys wanting to pick up chicks in Monaco, etc. These answers can then significantly direct your product.<p>The alternative is to just build a product then hope the people clicking on your ad want to buy it. Doing even basic market research with something like the underachiever method will put you streets ahead of that point by at least giving you an indicator of what even a small group is definitely going to want to buy.",1237529495

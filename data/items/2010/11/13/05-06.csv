1900429,comment,1898600,1899444,0,0,chancho,,,"This is a great comment and I appreciate the links.<p>But the caveman explanation for health and nutrition always leaves me cold. Yeah ok we can pretty much gauge what proto-humans ate and why it was good for them, but what if it made them miserable? It's romantic to think that early humans lived in the garden of lo-carb eden, but what if it really fucking sucked? What if they were just plain <i>hugnry all the time</i>, it was miserable and only the strong survived?<p>Don't get me wrong I think most of the conclusions are right, but I prefer evidence collected from modern people to justify those conclusions. Appealing to evolutionary biology is only valid for survival and reproduction. It doesn't say anything about happiness, fulfillment, etc.<p>I seem to recall some crackpot theory that low-calorie diets (ie., borderline starvation) increase your lifespan. That would certainly jive with the caveman hypothesis, but does it sound like fun? How miserable are we willing to make ourselves for a few extra years in a nursing home? That's probably a false dichotomy, but you get the point.",1289627745

In other words, the client knows the name of the uri for the functionality it wants, but it doesn't have to know the uri. This allows the uris to change if needed.<p>It's like using constants instead of literals in your code. If the literal value has to change you only have to change the constant definition, not every place in the code where the value is used.",1289627492

For that little bit extra it uses between 1-2 gigs of ram (instead of 50 megs), requires more setup and maintenance, you can't just drop a ruby folder on it and go, etc. All of the auto completion, real time docs, etc are flaky as hell with a language like ruby. It really has no idea what methods exist on an object, or what class an object is. And heaven forbid I want to open something crazy like a bash script in netbeans.<p>Also, and I've never understood why this is, plugins seem to be much more fragile on the big IDEs than the editors like emacs, vim, and textmate. You'd think they'd break less with all the static typing of java, but in my experience I've had far more problems with them.<p>I do love the git integration though.

I'm curious about the specific characteristics of any web mail that HNers would consider valuable? I am NOT referring to the solution of setting up your own domain mail server and linking it to browser interface or mobile client. I can think of two: (1) Easy download/backup: API for fast batch import/export, zip files via browser, etc. (something beyond IMAP). I would be willing to pay extra for this service; (2) Providing reasonable assurance that data associated with my account or with individual emails do not persist after the account or the emails are deleted. I admit the second characteristic is theoretically impossible without complete control and audit of the hardware. I hope someone can propose a novel transparent process (such as data being stored in escrow or audited by certified third party or something).

Which case all you will learn is that you can stand your ground.<p>Now if it's a layoff, that's a different story. I've always been told that you should work your way out of your job. Meaning do such a stellar job that they really dont need you anymore. In this sense, it's a good thing, because you actually know when it's time to move on or that what you're doing is not up to your full potential.<p>But there is another set of people that constantly strife to improve and move up in their own skill set and role. These people move as opportunity comes to them. They are never laid off or fired, per se, but know how to actively advance their career and goals effectively.

1900372,comment,1898783,1900089,0,0,MBlume,,,"A quick taxonomy of fanfic (from someone who spent way too much time in HP fandom in college):<p>fill-in-the-blanks: This is a story that tells parts of the original work's backstory. The custom is to try scrupulously to maintain canon compatibility -- ie ensure that your work, and the original works, could be presented as a unified whole without contradiction. Fernwithy (<a href=""http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=profile&id=507"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=profile&id=50...</a>) writes beautifully in this mode, is <i>very</i> careful about maintaining consistency, and has only started writing stories set in the future of the series since the 7th book closed the canon up.<p>The future fic:\nThis is the sort of thing authors do because they're impatient for the next installment of canon. They try to write the next installment themselves. Again, consistency is considered important. Usually there's some wish-fulfillment, not so much in terms of self-insertion, but in terms of the author taking the story where they wished it would go, especially by pairing two characters the author likes together.<p>After the End(<a href=""http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619</a>) and The Letters of Summer(<a href=""http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/53/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/53/</a>) are both good examples.<p>Once the next installment of canon comes out, the future fic is usually retroactively labelled AU, or alternate universe.<p>The single-point-of-departure AU:\n""For want of a nail, the horse was lost..."" -- the author picks a very specific time and place in canon in which something goes differently, and then tells the story from there. Even here, consistency is prized, unless you can <i>justify</i> how the change arose from the point of departure. I haven't read much in this mode, so I don't have any immediate suggestions.<p>A strangely specific variant of the single-point-of-departure is the Peggy Sue, in which a main character travels back in time, inhabits the body of his/her young self, and redoes everything using their knowledge of future events. Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past (<a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_N...</a>) and Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time (<a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_W...</a>) are both examples. Peggy Susie (<a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5731071/1/Peggy_Susie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5731071/1/Peggy_Susie</a>) is a one-shot parody of this genre by MoR's author.<p>The crack-fic:\nThe author takes the story miles into left field, usually played for laughs. How Hogwarts Became a Nudist Colony (<a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2179136/1/How_Hogwarts_Became_a_Nudist_Colony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2179136/1/How_Hogwarts_Became_a_...</a>) or Potter Puppet Pals (<a href=""http://www.potterpuppetpals.com/newppp/channels/TroubleAtHogwarts.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.potterpuppetpals.com/newppp/channels/TroubleAtHog...</a>) are prime examples. No rules here but the rule of Funny.<p>MoR doesn't fit neatly into any of these categories, but <i>starts out</i> sounding a lot like it's going to be a single-point-of-departure AU (the notes at the top of the first chapter have now been edited to specifically disclaim this). MoR is an example of, well, taking another author's universe, using the bits you like, and changing whatever you need to change to tell the story you want to tell, in the manner you want to tell it. It shares this ""genre"" with most comic reboots, Homer, Milton, the Bible, the brothers Grimm, Disney -- basically a huge chunk of western culture. But it still doesn't quite fit into the set of genres commonly seen in HP fanfic.",1289625503

It may not be the majority, but the Ruby (and Rails) audience is certainly not ""extremely small.""<p>A clean, extensible editor like TextMate that gets out of your way is all you really need when you're working with tools that don't require an IDE.  I think the main reason we haven't seen a major update yet is that so many people are happy with the current TextMate and are still willing to pay for it. I don't think we'll see a major upgrade until people start voting with their (lack of) dollars, rather than just complaining on forums.",1289625434

It really doesn't do much: it can turn a QScriptValue (think that's the name -- been a while and I'm on my phone) and turns it into one of a few basic types on the .NET side, and does the inverse.  It also let's you call methods on QSVs, or hook up to signals.  I just built it as needed to make my FTP hack work.  It's got some nice magic that allows you to find connections between QObjects, though, which is how I can get access to everything in the client just from the lobby/table window handle.  Qt doesn't provide the neccesary functionality, so my framework patches and hooks a few things, e.g. signal connections.<p>Edit: to address the separate release part, I really don't think I'd want to do that with this.  It's one of the few serious barriers to entry (the object traversal magic, specifically) that makes it non-trivial to bot the hell out of FTP.

If you are (or can be) happy, then you should definitely sit down with the company owners. If you feel that you can't be happy there, you should quit and look for a new job and the sooner the better - otherwise you might burn out or loose the joy that software development gives you because of your current job.<p>If you have decided to sit down with your boss, my opinion is the following:\n1. You are there from the beginning. That probably means that you have a lot of knowledge of the business and products. This makes you very valuable and irreplaceable to them! Use this in your advantage when negotiating. Keep in mind that it will take a lot of time, money and effort to get someone to the same level as you are at the moment.<p>2. Have a clear list of requirements and requests. What kind of a title do you want to have? What kind of work would you like to do? What will make you a happy and motivated employee? What kind of salary do you want? Just go all out on the list! Put everything that you want and then some so you can drop back in the negotiations. A positive side effect of making this list is that you will also identify to yourself whether there is something in this company that can make you happy.<p>3. When you sit down with your boss, remind him of all the work that you have done for the company and explain to him why you deserve what you want.<p>Remember that just because you have spent so much time with this company, it doesn't mean that you can't find something better. Also, if you decide to leave I would recommend either starting something for yourself (freelance, startup) or joining a bigger company/corporation - while the job can be a bit boring compared to that in a startup, it certainly will be a nice change for you - you will get better pay, company perks and much more relaxed environment. If you can afford it, also take some time to rest before your new job - travel a bit, party hard and all the nice things :)<p>Hope that helps!",1368788392

It takes a lot of time and effort to create one.<p>Children have some certain negative aspects in them and have some positive aspects in them. Parenting is all about making good aspects stronger and negative aspects weaker.<p>Recently, my child started yelling like crazy. She will just start screaming at a restaurant thinking it's fun (3 year old). Or just yell at 3 am. I could yell back and make this negative aspect stronger, instead I enrolled her to the music classes to channel all this yelling energy into something good.

The users.\nA friend of mine called me saying : Hey, I do that every morning, and the current way of doing it is a pain. I am sure you can do something for me.<p>And magically enough, I got motivated, working my arse off to get the first version finished. Since it is on the market, I got 60 recurring users and growing. And this keeps me motivated. I put hours on the project, just because I get feedback.<p>So the conclusion: Do something that someone asked you to. Get your users first, start working afterwards. \nDon't be alone.<p>If you don't have users, then join a project that has already started, in order to code with someone and get some interaction.<p>I think that for a good 90% of us, what keeps up working is the passion for solving problems others have.<p>Hope this helps :)",1368787884

Yes, I'm aware most people don't use Opera before someone reminds me, but there are a lot of Opera Mobile/Mini users. On a personal standpoint, I like to make sure the js/css I write degrades gracefully and supports Opera Desktop too (something that Google has had troubles with caring about in certain sites they maintain).<p>They also don't mention how it works on older versions of browsers (specifically IE and if it works fine on IE 9 and 8). I generally don't care about anything before IE 8 anymore, but with jQuery dropping support for IE 8 in jQuery 2.0, I am wondering if Google followed suit.

5723481,comment,5721311,5721311,2,0,nbevans,,,"I totally relate to this story. I was in an identical position  just over a year ago.<p>I spent 6 years co-founding a startup (though because of my age I was never recognised as a founder). I put so many hours into the software, evenings and even some weekends. The codebase was almost a work of art, built for the long term. And the business would have scaled up with the system I had built.<p>The directors however were clueless. For 2 years they didn't  have a clue how to sell the product I have built. Even though it was clear as day to me how to take it to the market we were targeting. Eventually they cracked it and we started selling lots and, at the time I left, the firm was doing 1mil in revenue. It's probably a third higher by now.<p>It was my first job out of Uni. and in hindsight I was a bit naive. Though not entirely naive as I remember having many thoughts through the years thinking that things ""didn't feel quite right"". Something was off. I was putting in all this work to build an awesome product. And the directors/sales guys were putting in only a fraction of the effort, and always far away from hitting any high notes.<p>I learnt that one of the directors was siphoning out money of the firm into one of his other companies, through dodgy service contracts between the two. It seemed every month or two he'd start saying we're struggling to pay the bills even though we'd just made 60k that month on new customer sales alone. This was a 4 employee company making 60g's most months and it was just so obvious all was not as it seemed on the books. I once calculated the firm was making a clear 300k profit and yet I never saw a single penny of that through a dividend. Not even as a bonus.<p>Eventually I realised I could not stay there any more, despite having a small shareholding. I told them a year before I left that unless something big changes in the way things are run then I shall be leaving. Possibly a stupid move in hindsight as this pretty much put the nail in the coffin of my relationship with them and of course I didn't see any salary rise that year, not even inflationary.<p>I left on good'ish terms, even if one of the directors started an e-mail argument (a ""see you in court"" type affair) with me a few weeks later accusing me (falsely) of secretly starting up a rival company. Ludicrous.<p>I'm still recovering mentally from the whole experience. Obviously what I've shared here is barely a 5% of what went on. Some day I'll write an epic blog post about it I'm sure. I certainly went through some dark periods but I'm on the mend now and have learnt to channel it in such a way that I learn from it and to make me better equiped for the next time I do a startup.<p>The way I see it now is, those 6 years at this startup weren't a complete loss. Sure I didn't get to cash out my shareholding (though maybe some day I will, as the firm is still successful thanks to the product I built). But I was living at home and taking home 40k which is a lot for someone the age that I was. I saved pretty much 85% of my money and ended up with a huge deposit to put down on a London apartment. I moved to London early last year and have moved on with my life.<p>I would encourage the OP to break free. Don't take a month off or anything as that will only make you feel worse. The best thing you can do is get back on the horse, get a new job, maybe even move town/city if you have to. You need to press the gas pedal on your life for at least 6 months, that's what I did, to help you move on and forget. The worst thing you can do is quit the job and let off the gas pedal. That could have dire consequences for your mental health.<p>Hope this helps.",1368785552

But no worse that a multitude of user names.<p>Perhaps a better message might be:<p>'If your email address is registered, then we will attempt to send out an email containing a reset code.  Please check your inbox.<p>If you do not receive an email to your given address, then you may not have registered with given email.<p>Allow time for the arrival of email, and please check your spam folder.'<p>But it gets a little long winded...    I'd almost rather not have a password, and be sent a new code each time (albeit transparently).<p>I invariably forget passwords and logins frequently.  So go through this process like you as a matter of routine.<p>Bad times potentially though for when your email service is down or when your email address has expired.  Or your email account has been exploited.",1368785481

While you can have something that is UTF-8, there's a couple of wrinkles with trying to use that with java i18n.<p>See:\n<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html#getBundle%28java.lang.String,%20java.util.Locale,%20java.lang.ClassLoader%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ResourceB...</a><p>... when you load a resourcebundle, it tries to load a properties file, and it ends up calling this method:<p><a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load%28java.io.InputStream%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Propertie...</a><p>... which mentions the encoding.<p>There's a couple of ways around this - one is to write a bunch of code to change how resourcebundles are loaded, the other is to use java's native2ascii tool in your to provide files that are correctly escaped.",1368785200

Nothing (no frameworks, no previous standards, not even plugins) has ever enabled true component-level sandboxing within the same document. This is just HTML/CSS/JS that is sandboxed into its own component. This library isn't revolutionary, because it's intended to be a polyfill for future-facing (and present) standards which aren't yet widely supported. But what these standards describe IS revolutionary.<p>A ""component"" in every library/framework ever has just been some HTML template along with some accompanying JS that makes it ""do"" stuff. You shove that on your page and watch as your CSS styles conflict with it and break the way it looks or your JS modifies something it relies on and breaks its functionality. They break, all the time. A component as described here does not suffer from such problems.<p>FYI: if you think you're being more productive towards building any scale user interfaces with ExtJS, you're doing EVERYTHING wrong.",1368784950

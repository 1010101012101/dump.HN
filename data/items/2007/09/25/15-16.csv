59438,comment,59399,59399,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I wonder how much of their time the second time around was saved because they had already built so much back-end? I know the gist of the article is to concentrate on ideas and user experience instead of features, but having all that work in place had to be a big boost for them.<p>\nI think some of the best programs I've seen were built once, thrown away, then built again. Once you start coding, it is easy to put the blinders on and think only in terms of features and not users. Likewise, it's easy to think of a million user experiences you want to provide without having any clue how the pieces are coming together. In a way, they had two startups, one for each problem. Seems like it worked out well for them.",1190734740

59436,comment,59392,59427,0,0,randallsquared,,,"According to later posts on this, many calculations which involve storing 65535 <i>or</i> 100000 really store the other one:<p>Dana DeLouis writes: """"""<p>And if you multiply be say, 2 you get something else: <p>=A1 MUL 2 \nreturns 131070, as if A1 had 65535. (which it should have been) <p>=A1 MUL 1 \nKeeps it at 100000. <p>=A1-1 returns 65534 <p>=A1/1 is still 100000 <p>=A1/2 retuns 32767.5 \n""""""<p>Given that it would more often be the case that 65535 or 100000 comes up as an intermediate number than the final result, it could be that there are many calculations that have been done in error silently for those using Excel 2007.<p>EDIT: Replaced asterisks with MUL because I don't know how to escape them.\n",1190734313

59434,comment,59392,59427,0,0,nickb,,,"Well, how many have actually gone undetected? There are quite a few papers out there that show that Excel-induced accounting/financial errors are a lot more common than previously thought. Some financial services have gone as so far to prohibit the use of Excel in their financial planning and forecasting.<p>\nCheck out some of the papers on Google Scholar for bibliography: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=excel+bug&btnG=Search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off...</a><p>\n",1190733829

59432,comment,59392,59427,0,0,henning,,,"Under infinite precision the probability of selecting this particular expression to evaluate is zero. Under finite precision it is small.<p>However, it raises the question of what other errors Excel has. Excel has had other serious mathematical errors in the past - like the standard deviation function. In Excel 97, if you wrote down a sequence of large numbers with a standard deviation much less than the mean (1e10, 1e10 + 1, ..., 1e10 + 10, say) it would say the standard deviation is equal to zero!<p>Furthermore it doesn't help that there's always a total lack of transparency in how Microsoft handles bugs. We have no way of knowing whether Microsoft knows about this, if or when they intend to fix it, and what other problems this could possibly hint it. Megalomaniacal megacorporations are so banal.",1190733707

I keep hearing ""yes, but the high end tasks will remain here"" from every proponent of overseas outsourcing.<p>Why?  Indian people and Chinese people and I'm sure people from lots of other countries are just as smart as us and often highly educated.  There is absolutely no reason they can't do so called ""high end tasks"" as well as we can.",1190733202

Office 2007 has been out for almost a year and this being the first time we've heard about it seems to imply that not many users have run into this issue.

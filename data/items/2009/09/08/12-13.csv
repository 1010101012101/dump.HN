810842,comment,809952,810559,0,0,djm,,,"A lot of what you are saying here resonates  with me. I work part-time for a local charity in my town and have been involved in various others at times. There are a number of problems charities normally face which may explain your findings to some extent, including:<p>- well meaning but incompetent staff. People don't seem to understand that wanting to do good doesn't naturally translate into the ability to do it.<p>- no real management. I suppose this may be  local phenomenon, but where I am (UK), there seems to be a tendency for small charities to be managed by wealthy housewives as a kind of hobby job. There is very definitely a social network of them that dominate the charities in my town. Often this means the management will be consistently absent from the organization. You can also see my previous point.<p>- no real check on the management. Charity trustees are often people who just want their name to be associated with a charitable organization. I can think of several trustees of the charity I work for who probably have only a vague idea of what we actually do.<p>- funding constraints. Charities in the UK who receive funding from government departments are usually monitored in terms of the volume of work they do rather than the outcomes they produce (which are much harder to quantify). Thus the incentive is often to not try to improve efficiency as reducing the work load may negatively impact funding.<p>Obviously my examples are to some extent just personal experiences that may not be universal. However I would guess that most non-profits face similar problems and that these problems may help explain why you got such a negative reception with your projects.<p>With regards to volunteers though, what did you to do assess their competency to perform the tasks they were willing to help out with? I ask because part of my job is to manage my organization's volunteers (which mostly come to us on work experience placements from the job centre). They frequently start working for us claiming to have various skills and then we discover that they often don't. For this reason I am usually quite unhappy about accepting new volunteers - when I have to get rid of them is is much harder  (emotionally, for me) than sacking an incompetent employee. This might also help explain some of the resistance you encountered to what you were doing.",1252414737

Spending a lot of money to keep up with the Joneses ? (arms race on a small town level)<p>Teenagers spending a fortune on ringtones, phone applications ? (and they're buying this stuff on credit)<p>Some choices are simply objectively wrong. There are even some laws to protect consumers against this kind of thing, for instance in some countries if you buy something on-line you have a right to a refund within a certain period.<p>> The farmer's got tons of wheat and all his capital is tied up in it; the family's cupboard is bare, and you can't eat dollars. Trading a pound of wheat for a couple of dollars is advantageous to both.<p>The farmer is not 'pushing' his wares though, he makes them available at a fair price on a market. The family is free to buy their wheat from another farmer based on the objective criteria of quality, price and convenience. He's not going to go out of his way to try to get people to buy his produce at the expense of his neighbour.<p>Farmers are a particular bad example by the way, most individual farmers (at least those that I'm familiar with, there are probably plenty of counterexamples) are held by the throat by 'buying consortia' that consist of large supermarket chains. They set the price, not the sellers.<p>Hardly any consumers go and buy their food from the farmers directly, unless you live near a 'farmers market' in a rural area.<p>This is one reason why plenty of farmers go out of business, only to have their bankrupt farms bought up by fronts operated by those consortia.<p>Transactions on the free market have a 'middle ground', unfortunately the free market is an illusion, no transaction is completely free.<p>A 'free market' for instance assumes that parties do not collude.",1252414556

My point is that I don't think he'd be able to arrive at the same conclusion without exaggerating like that, <i>because the subtle effects of advertising doesn't have such damaging effect</i>.<p>> (2) the more subtle effect is usually in the other direction.<p>What you're saying is that most people more often than not are influenced to make decisions that are not good for them or their families?

(OpenBSD installs them with its default documentation, I think FreeBSD does as well.) Some parts will be obsolete, but the big ideas are the same. For example, it covers lex and yacc better in about ten pages each than the O'Reilly book could in twenty times that. Same with make, and several other major parts in the Unix toolchain.<p>For starters, learn to use: apropos, cron, the basics of sed and awk, the shebang, a <i>real</i> editor, screen or tmux, tar, gzip, and find. Read man pages, see where they lead you. Try to automate stuff, and go spelunking in the infrastructure for whatever Unix distro you use.<p>I also found that I learned a LOT by getting away from stuff that assumed Linux.

Well, yeah, sure -- but it's so abstract that it doesn't make sense. Even the simplest product has dozens of properties, which again are complicated to understand. There will always be some level of not understanding something, and then you fall back to rely on trusting someone, and that's the end of pure-to-the-core pull.<p>> Most consumption of 'primary needs goods' is still on 'pull' basis,<p>I don't agree. There has been advertising long before the ordinary consumer could afford anything luxurious. I'm talking about stuff like this: <a href=""http://www.advertisingantiques.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advertisingantiques.co.uk/</a><p>> But the recursion bottoms out where you run out of funds to buy something that you really need. (...) By having individuals compete with companies that have meanwhile spent upwards of a century honing their skills we are creating a completely uneven battle.<p>Never the less, in the vast, vast, vast majority of cases the individual wins that battle. When that doesn't happen, there are usually a general inability to prioritise resources behind it. And if it happens, if someone prioritises making a payment on a huge plasma TV rather than feeding their children, I would find it morally bankrupt to blame advertising for that failure.<p>> The best way to describe 'to benefit someone' is to say that their lives have a maximized sense of happiness (...) if you buy the 'wrong' car because a salesman pushed it down your throat<p>Sure, and that's fine on the individual level. On the other hand, most people are notoriously aware of especially car salesmen for exactly this reason. And sometime someone needs to get burned, that's how this awareness is kept alive. It's a feedback mechanism, and it's working fine. One of the reasons I bought my last (used) car from the guy I did, was that he insisted that I should take it to a third party mechanic to check it out before signing. The car I got was not the one I initially though I'd get. I'll never know if I'm happier or not (oh well, I'm happier, this one is faster :) ).<p>>  I would suggest you look everywhere but to your government, almost by definition it does not have the common best interest at heart<p>I agree.

810758,comment,810484,810695,0,0,jwhite,,,"> ""3 am returning from a night on the town""<p>:-) that's true, and I am partial to the odd drunken cheeseburger myself, but I'm not a 6 year old nagging my Mum to take me to MacDonalds because I just _have_ to have the latest piece of cheap plastic that I can only get if I can convince her to buy it for me with the special promotional meal deal.  I do my late-night run maybe three times a year (maybe yours is more frequent?), but how often does the 6-year old want to go to MacDonalds?  How often does her mother give in?  Of course that varies by case, but I think on average more often than me.  So, I would guess that MacDonalds' bottom line is significantly affected by their ability to manipulate children into manipulating their parents into doing something that they might not do otherwise, and that almost certainly is not good for their health (although possibly their wallets would be better off than with the home-cooked-meal option, a point that should give everyone pause for thought).  The fact that their advertising is strongly biased in that direction supports that hypothesis.<p>> Manipulative? It's not like they lie about their purpose.<p>Being manipulative does not require lying.  That doesn't mean that it is morally acceptable.<p>You said that you believe the story to be hyperbole ""because the real world don't lend itself well to the point he wants to make"".  I don't really see myself as part of the movement you refer to, and I didn't mean to appear so.  I also don't want to give the impression that I think I have everything worked out, with a plan for how to make it work in the real world.  However, I do think the real world gives ample evidence supporting his point. From what you say above I think we probably agree on how the world actually does work, so I hope you'll forgive me the liberty of suggesting that you actually meant to say that the real world doesn't lend itself to any alternative, at least, no alternative that wouldn't end up in an equivalent situation.<p>I understand your point and I agree that in a great many situations, consumers make choices that, viewed objectively, aren't in their ""best interests"", for some paternalistic idea of whatever they are.  Should we accept this as justified or moral, just because it is an inevitable outcome of a game set up in this way?  I don't think we necessarily need to, and that doesn't mean passing negative judgment on the consumer's choice in the process.<p>Interestingly, PG's writings support this view in many ways, and I think there are even some examples in real life that suggest this as well.  For instance, the MPAA and RIAA are engaged in a campaign to convince people that they have natural rights that are being violated by people choosing the no-cost option of downloading digital media.  Firstly, their rights are in no way natural.  But more importantly, new technology has shown up their business model as antiquated and inefficient.  The digital media downloading phenomenon can be viewed as equivalent to a black market; black markets always arise when the legal market prices are kept artificially above what the fair market price would be in a free economy (viz iTunes Store).  The whole economy, including the media companies, would be better off in the long run if the media companies reconsidered their business models to take advantage of the efficiencies offered by new technologies, rather than fighting to defend their existing, inefficient investments.  However, the media companies' best short-term strategy is to try to maintain the status quo.<p>A company's attempts to manipulate the attitudes and purchasing habits of consumers don't have to be accepted simply because they are the logical consequence of the way the game is currently structured.  It is always possible to change the game.<p>Thanks for your reply, it really made me think about this in detail.",1252411996

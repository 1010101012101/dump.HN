5272008,comment,5269719,5270009,1,0,bmelton,,,"Outright banning is only legally permissible when a) the state can prove that they are able to NARROWLY infringe your rights and b) that they can demonstrate significant gains and c) if the firearm to be banned is not ""one in common use at the time"".<p>For affirmations of this, you can reference the Supreme Court decisions in DC v Heller (and to a lesser degree, Chicago v McDonald).  Both cases were notable for having overturned outright firearms bans in both DC and Chicago as they were Constitutional infringements.<p>It's also worth noting that they're both relatively recent cases.<p>The AR15 is the most common rifle sold in America today, and while a 1994 Assault Weapons ban was able to get passed, I genuinely don't believe it could happen today.  There have been a plethora of recent Supreme Court cases affirming that citizens have the right to bear arms, even though the state might wish to prohibit it, and as these are SCOTUS decisions, they of course apply at a federal level.  In the 94 ban, there hadn't been any challenges to gun control legislation since US v Miller, in 1939, and that was at the very least an odd case as Miller was tried in absentia, and actually died before the case concluded with an unfavorable verdict for him.<p>Regardless, the cases are piling up in support of the second amendment, with Illinois' firearms ban having been affirmed as unconstitutional just a few days ago (though the initial ruling happened sometime last year).<p>I realize this is a large rant in response to a fairly small statement, but I think that precedent pretty much eliminates either a regressive licensing system or blanket banning (on firearms in common use), though of course there may be other strategies (which I'm sure we'll find out as many states are passing clearly Unconstitutional legislation).",1361663679

Is there a specific aspect of ES6 you're thinking of?<p>But the new features of ES6 aren't features of CoffeeScript.  Why would we expect them to be?<p>It's like noting that Java 7 adds support for strings to switch statements and wondering how the syntax of Closure is going to change in response.<p>There is no strict requirement for the languages to be tied together at a syntax level, they just ""compile"" to something compatible.<p>There may be strong technical reasons for the CoffeeScript <i>compiler</i> to take advantage of the new features of ES6, but that doesn't force a change to CoffeeScript-the-language.  (In other words, it <i>can</i> target ES6 while remaining backward compatible.)<p>I wouldn't be surprised to discover I'm missing something, but I'm genuinely confused why this is seen as a technical problem. It's not that CoffeeScript-the-language is ""not interested in the new features of ES6"", but that, technically speaking, CoffeeScript-the-language is not interested in ES-the-language at all.<p>Apples and oranges.  (Or maybe lemons and limes.)<p>As an aside, I <i>do</i> see this as a potential social problem. CoffeeScript would probably like to remain conceptually-compatible with JavaScript, and that gets much harder if the two have different semantics for similar syntax-es, but I'm going to guess this isn't the only example of it.",1361663560

5271988,comment,5270479,5271674,2,0,T-R,,," - Most likely they're doing specific financing: whenever you pay with a card (or with your cell phone) in Japan, they ask you how many monthly payments you would like to pay over. There's also a general aversion to going into debt - cash and debit cards are generally preferred over credit cards in Japan.<p>- I'm not sure if I'm thinking of the right 'fake beer', but marketing of food products in Japan has lately been heavily skewed toward 0 calorie food and drinks. I'm not sure this is entirely fueled by reduced purchasing power.<p>- The internet in Japan is still very much limited by the fact that it's still primarily browsed via low resolution cell phones. It's getting better, but a fair amount of sites were written for C-HTML/i-mode-HTML, and laptop browsing experience suffered as a result.<p>- The effect of fringe groups on trends plays out differently in different industries. For Anime, shows with more mainstream appeal are actually hard to find now. On the other hand, in Japan, Anime has always been less mainstream than Manga - people who read a series as a comic book often find the TV shows to be watered-down, or don't find the voice acting to their liking. So, it's more just that a medium that's always had fringe appeal is doubling-down on it. That is, it likely would have happened even without reduced mainstream purchasing power - otaku, who actually buy merchandise, are just a more profitable group to market to.<p>With fashion and music, it's more that the fringe groups have bought the power to influence mainstream habits - plenty of people who aren't otaku but enjoy AKB48 and Perfume. Many shop at d.i.a. but aren't gyaru (at least not to the extreme the author portrays them as) - just trying to be fashionable, particularly in the short period of time between being in school (with black hair, uniform, and no piercings) and working (with black hair, uniform/suit, and no piercings). The increased availability of foreign brands also has an effect - by moving toward more extreme domestic trends, brands can better distinguish themselves from foreign competitors: with the surge in popularity of K-Pop, it doesn't make sense to try to compete with more of the same style of music.<p>I don't disagree with the general premise of the article, but I think its tone comes off as a little extreme at times - things aren't so bad there that mainstream purchasing has disappeared, it's just shifted toward some very distinctly Japanese trends, which were popularized at least in part due to the disproportionate spending by those groups.",1361663188

5271926,comment,5271516,5271845,17,0,joshkaufman,,,"Sure. The best place to start is by keeping very close tabs on the types of books you want to write. Watch the new titles coming out, and track what they're doing to promote. You'll see a direct correlation between how well the book is marketed and how well it sells. The <i>Publisher's Weekly</i> deal newsletter is a great resource for finding new titles. Amazon is the best overall research database.<p>Also, start to pay attention to how your favorite books are structured. The hard part of non-fiction writing isn't really the factual content, it's how the whole book is put together. Once you get the structure right, the rest of the book comes together pretty quickly. For both of my books, I spent probably 60% of my time working the outline.<p>The overall lack of marketing sophistication among authors is astonishing. Publishers aren't good at it either: they'll handle negotiating with retailers, and some pitch in with PR support, but most of the time the author is on their own. If you know even a little bit about online and/or direct marketing, you have a <i>massive</i> advantage. If you already have an audience through a blog or business, you're golden.<p>Here's the landing page for my first book: <a href=""http://book.personalmba.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.personalmba.com/</a>. That page has a 30%+ conversion rate to a retail visit. Among the retailers I can track, 50% of the people who visit a retail page for the book end up buying it. Just being able to track this simple stuff is huge, and makes it possible to spend more money on marketing. Treating each book like a product that must be supported indefinitely helps a lot - way too many authors launch a book without planning long-term support.<p>Depending on what you want to write, you might seriously check into self-publishing. Working with a large publisher has some great benefits, mostly in terms of editorial, art, and production support, but you give up a <i>huge</i> chunk of royalty and control when you sign a publishing contract. You can hire contractors to do most of these things yourself. I really enjoy working with Penguin/Portfolio, but I still run the self-pub numbers every time I think about signing on to do a new book. <i>Print-on-Demand Book Publishing</i> by Morris Rosenthal is a bit dated, but it's still a good overview of the tradeoffs.<p>As far as revenue: when I started, I was advising early-stage entrepreneurs full-time, and my first advance was a nice bonus. Now, somewhere around 80% of monthly income is royalties and advance payments, and I'm no longer doing active advising. The rest comes from courses, both online and offline. Every time I agree to write a new book, that's a nice bump in income for the year. I'm in the midst of re-doing my online course, so when that launches, it'll probably be a larger percentage of income. My income isn't huge by CEO standards, but I'm well past my personal point of diminishing returns.<p>My best advice in terms of finances is to keep your overhead low: being an author takes a lot of time, but doesn't require much stuff. Once you have a decent computer setup, the major costs are research and travel. Free time becomes the scarce commodity.<p>Helpful?",1361661808
5271925,comment,5269719,5270527,2,0,bmelton,,,"There are a LOT of semi-automatic rifles that aren't AR15s.  There are semi-automatic shotguns, and semi-automatic pistols as well.  Speaking objectively, most firearms bought today are semi-automatic.  A semi-automatic weapon is inherently no more or less dangerous than any other gun in the hands of someone who knows how to use it.<p>Just for clarity, and I don't mean to assume that you don't know, but as most people I've spoken with have it entirely wrong, a semi-automatic firearm means that when you pull the trigger, a bullet is fired.  There is no 'burst' or 'spray' mode, and there's no tangible difference between an AR15 and, say, a Browning BAR (<a href=""http://www.chuckhawks.com/browning_BAR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chuckhawks.com/browning_BAR.jpg</a>), and ""assault weapons bans"", in my opinion, penalize a gun for looking like military weapons, when in reality they function nothing like military weapons (as they don't have burst, spray or fully automatic fire modes).<p>If they're famous for causing havoc recently, it almost certainly speaks more to their popularity than anything else.  If the most popular car in the America were the Ford Taurus, it would likely be involved in more accidents than other cars, based on sheer math.  The AR15 is the most popular rifle sold in America today.  The reasons for its popularity are because of its modular design, not its lethality.  With an AR15, I can replace the upper assembly without need of a gunsmith.  This means I can have one ""gun"" for both long and short range shooting.  I can 'bolt on' attachments like a scope, night lights, laser sights, bipods, etc., without having to pay somebody else to do it for me.  It's popular today for the same reasons Linux is popular with nerds -- because you can tinker with it.<p>As for its lethality, it fires a small caliber, low-weight round (.223).  In its generally short-barreled configuration (though again, that is moduler) it is considered a 'varmint' gun, used to kill raccoons, coyotes, wolves and the like from a ranch, or what have you.  If people were choosing their killing weapons based on lethality, they would have chosen an AR10 (.308 round) or something like a Saiga 12, which is a magazine-fed shotgun.",1361661802

For example, char is the cardinality of the smallest addressable unit of memory of the machine (often 256).

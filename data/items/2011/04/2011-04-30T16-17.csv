What, a giant corporation uses every legal means at its disposal to make sure it gets only good PR? What, there exist serious race and class disparities in the United States that manifest themselves in the workplace? What, Google has a good PR department that doesn't reflect actual internal practices? Quelle horreur!<p>What's more interesting from a sociological perspective is the range of most of the reactions here on Hacker News, which seem to vary between ""he doesn't understand that this is just how things work"" to brick shitting freak out (""passive aggressive"", ""nitwit"", ""see a psychologist"").<p>If you find yourself immediately jumping into defense mechanisms, stop for a second and think about why that is.",1304182529
2500969,comment,2500967,2500967,4,0,circleriot,,,"About a month ago, there was a post here on hacker news about how Google was potentially working on a social networking site based around your circles. Turns out that it was just a rumor and that Google has no intention on working on such a site. I really liked the idea and it was something that i had personally been waiting for. Since Google had abandoned circles (or the idea of it at least) i then entertained the thought of rolling one out for me and my friends. So I started digging around on the subject and found Paul Adam's presentation ""The real life social network"" <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/padday/the-real-life-social-network-v2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/padday/the-real-life-social-networ...</a> and became fully inspired to create CircleRiot. One fun month later of just coding; i rolled out CircleRiot for me and my friends to enjoy. Needless to say they loved it. So now I thought i'd share this with hacker news hoping that you guys will enjoy it as well as we did. So enjoy! Feel free to leave feedback. I'm anxious to hear what you guys think of this.<p>Btw: this site is invites only. If you'd like to invite your friends, please send them the invite link that is created with your account. Thank you!",1304182523

2500953,comment,2500082,2500082,2,0,rmrm,,,"Seems to me there are two issues:<p>1.) Yellow badge worker treatment -- most of the comments here seem to accept his description of their work life (right or wrong) as fact, it is unsubstantiated to me. I see a video of people getting in their cars and going home, that is all.  Considering he claims to have never spoken to any of them, except for a brief encounter before security grabbed him, it would seem even he is admitting he does not have first hand knowledge of anything he said.  It is an entirely less than complete view (and possibly incorrect description) to which to draw any conclusion.<p>For that reason most of the discussion seems premature to me.  With that said, no luxury transport, no free meals, etc -- does in fact describe the working conditions of 99.9% of Americans.  A company treating people normally is not substantially interesting, tho apparently juxtaposition makes it so -- because what is interesting, and has always been interesting about Google, is that they treat their employees extraordinarily well.<p>2.) Was Google ""right"" for wanting him off the campus?  Sure -- they contracted with his employer to provide some service, not to film an expose about Google itself,made possible only by being on the Google campus with unfettered access to the grounds.  I realize he says he did not film it with the idea it would be an expose, but film is shot to be shown, and in his letter he makes it fairly clear what his interest was in filming, the assumptions and/or understanding he had while filming -- which gives a fairly clear picture of why he was filming.  And it resulted in just about the kind of film you would expect.  That isn't what he was there for.  There is nothing that even remotely rises to a whistleblower type defense, as there is nothing remotely illegal about what he claims to be the yellow badge worker treatment.  If he had in fact been filming something illegal (or at least in some way out of the norm in a negative fashion, even), my opinion would be more substantially in his favor -- in relation to how egregious the treatment actually was.",1304181928

As I said they are not some random hacks, and they fully understand the importance of being open and transparent.<p>In other words, if you want to point a finger here, point it at Toshiba that failed to disclose the placement of ComputTrace on their laptops.

Even when companies do violate the law (Enron, Horizon, Chevron, etc.) there is a segment of society that rushes to minimize the wrongdoing.<p>My anecdotal experience on HN is that a lot people on the site defend the pursuit of money over what I consider greater moral considerations.  I can understand the perspective of the person you responded to.  His/her comment was inflammatory and you are right about that.<p>To answer your question though, I do believe that it is roughly true that pursuing riches makes it harder to be a moral person.  It's not impossible but I do believe it is harder.  It is my belief that in a majority of cases one's morality and perception of what is right/wrong/acceptable changes for the worse as they acquire more money.<p>I believe it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil (as a rough approximation).",1304179686

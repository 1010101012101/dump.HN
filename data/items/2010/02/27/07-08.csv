Nobody cares about specs, they care that they can't use their computer when a website using Flash is open.<p>If you were a programmer, you'd know that bugs can be fixed.  But not by sitting around and complaining, but by writing code.  Since Adobe won't let anyone fix their code, so the only solution left is to stop using Flash (and start using something else).

REST is just a list of 6 possible characteristics of network protocols/architectures (Client/Server, Stateless, Cache, etc), and an explanation of the benefits gained by having them.<p>That said, it&#x27;s true that REST by itself doesn&#x27;t tell you how to build an API. But all of that arguing about PUT/POST/PATCH, links here or there, etc, are mostly bikeshedding. It&#x27;s like arguing for tabs vs spaces or whether the { should go inline or not. Just read the HTTP spec and then, when in doubt, just pick one and try to be consistent.<p>But you&#x27;re right that many programmers don&#x27;t deal well with that. It&#x27;d be nice to have some kind of reference protocol using HTTP & JSON and complying with REST, even if it would be as arbitrary as any other possible RESTful protocol.",1432497599

While reading the story, I felt how the world still has a huge reserve of big hearts, and they can only be found at the right situation. Also, gratefulness is not only a great virtue, but also pays off sooner or later.<p>Being said all that, recently I&#x27;ve read many similar stories of sharp fall from the height of success. It seems, many people working in the private sectors are vulnerable to &quot;keep running, or you are doomed&quot; like theory. The social and economical structure in many countries, even many developing countries, are different which prevent the &quot;fall from the cliff&quot; like cases. Strong family bonds, affordable permanent ownership of properties etc are key to stability.<p>Many EU countries have balanced structure where you can choose to slow down in your career path, and to enjoy life. Although government in those countries charge a huge percentage of tax, they take care of their citizens to prevent the sharp fall in career and life.<p>Perhaps, too strong capitalism, attention to too many distractions all over the world, relying on numbers instead of the quality in those numbers etc are affecting the whole domestic socio-economic balance.",1432497483

The React source is definitely intimidating - what extensions did you feel it needed?<p>2. Animations are a tough problem, but I was under the impression that the communication isn&#x27;t usually the problem, it&#x27;s meshing a declarative representation with a mid-transition DOM. How is the Zorium approach better than the React one?<p>3. Flux, JSX and mixins are all completely optional and not compulsory to write a frontend in React; why did these motivate you to write a new library from scratch?<p>I hope these don&#x27;t come across too critical, I have a lot of respect for anyone who can even finish a project like this, let alone document it. I&#x27;ve heard lots of good things about React, so I&#x27;m curious to hear other perspectives!",1432497380

By this definition, software development <i>is</i> engineering. Note that it doesn&#x27;t say anything about how robust the structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes must be in order for the profession to count as engineering. Even the most fragile thing could have been designed and built by an engineer.<p>The root of the word is actually interesting: it comes from the Latin word &quot;ingenium&quot;, which means &quot;cleverness.&quot; This is especially important in our field since a large part of software development involves clever hacks.

If you have a mortgage on terms which allow this, then you&#x27;re probably better off keeping several months of overpayments in your mortgage account, on the understanding that you&#x27;re allowed to stop payments for that long in an emergency. Most lenders have some sort of terms like these, but check yours carefully before doing this.<p>This implies setting your mortgage repayment rate at a level which leaves you with sufficient income to overpay it.

Something like the Tesla PowerWall could potentially be scaled up to commercial energy production, but honestly we probably still have 30 years to go there.<p>As for cheaper, it&#x27;s still <i>slightly</i> more (30%) for PV solar than for nuclear (as far as I can tell). That will continue to come down, which is great. The cheapest clean energy is actually geothermal, but there are only so many places where the plate tectonics work with our current drilling technology. Ironically, drilling advancements for fracking and deep wells will open up the field for geothermal in many more places.<p>As for safety, the 5x number was for plant solar, not rooftop. Production of silicon PV panels is not clean, nor is it safe shipping millions of them around the world. However, the safety is so much higher than coal that I shouldn&#x27;t really be complaining.",1434495412

My neighbors will probably disagree with me, but all I require is $100 per household-year of high level waste generated. Since nuclear power generates approximately 1 coke can worth of waste per year of powering a household, a 55 gallon concrete cask will hold 586 households worth of waste for a year.<p>My disposal plan will add approximately half a cent per kilowatt hour to the price of electricity, and I have a minimum order size of 10000 casks, or the waste of 5,860,000 households. My half billion dollars will be primarily invested in: 
1) storing the casks in my backyard as a depot while I load them onto a container ship. 
2) A single container ship which I&#x27;ll float over deep ocean trenches, dodge hurricanes, and run fuel and supply ships out to.
3) Approximately 1/4th of a presidential campaign ($250 million) worth of advertising, marketing, and education about the safety of 3rd generation nuclear reactors.<p>I will then sell the &quot;waste&quot; back to the resulting 3rd generation reactors for $100,000 per cask (for around 5000 household-years worth of energy per cask). I figure I should net a profit on the scheme of around a billion dollars per iteration of this scheme, once I factor in my expenses.<p>Seriously. The &quot;waste&quot; problem is not a problem.

9729149,comment,9728997,9728997,0,0,techjuice,,,"I would highly recommend going in as a business instead, your rates can be even higher and you will already be prepped to higher people to help you complete your clients tasks so you can work on building your business.  Being a solo contractor is nice but being a business always has the upper hand in the short and long term.  If you do things right you might even be able to get government contracts as a sub contractor or a prime contractor.  Good thing is it can still just be you as the only employee at the start, then as your business grows you can create jobs by hiring people to work on your contracts.<p>When going from employee to a contractor you will normally double what you made hourly as an employee as you will need to pay the full amount for what your employer was paying.  So you will need to bring in at least $220,000/year or $105.77/hour to make what you were making as an employee.  You will also need to factor in enough income in case a client ends their contract with you or you have a dry spell for a bit.<p>To break this down more you will now need to pay for the full price for medicare, social security taxes, state and federal taxes, life insurance, health insurance, vacation time your own bonuses/raises if you want and your 401k.  Since your going solo you will need to also need to pay for contractor insurance, lawyer fees, accounting fees, financial adviser fees, regular training online (CBT training, ebooks, etc.) and offline (classes, certifications, etc.) to keep yourself sharp and ahead of your competition, upkeep of your hardware and software so you can run the latest and greatest software and modern hardware, secure website design and hosting if your not doing it yourself, secure email hosting, and furniture so your comfortable working.<p>One thing you may also want to look into is a business phone or number so when you want to offline from working you can actually do this and send any calls to an answering service (someone that can assist with a few things clients might call about and if it is an emergency if you have the customer on an instant access list transfer them to your cell phone for emergencies).<p>You will also need to be careful not to decrease your hourly rate too much or you will start running into troublesome clients that are slow to pay or very picky about what they agreed too and try to weasel themselves out of paying you what they are due.  You can increase/decrease the rate I listed but insure that you plug in all the numbers and account for things your employer paid for on your behalf.  Just remember as a contractor you need to make more than you did as an employee to cover your increased costs as most of what you make if it is equal or a little bit above your salary when you where an employee will be gobbled up by taxes, insurance, and keeping yourself up to date.",1434494430

As a schoolchild in a conservative region of the Southern US just after the end of the Cold War, I distinctly remember thinking that communism was actually a pretty cool idea, and just had some bad implementors. There are real people in the hacker community who advocate the restoration of the monarchy, the elimination of democracy, and the return of certain races to slavery, which naturally suits them. In Christian theological discourse, it&#x27;s not uncommon to see people accuse certain liberal theologians of first-millennium heresies. Unless there are other <i>actually</i> unspeakable things that were popular in the past, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any evidence that we&#x27;re writing ideas out of existence, just exerting social pressure to keep known-bad ideas from being retried again without learning the lessons of history. This (naturally) involves knowing what those ideas are.<p>Basically, given empirical evidence that a certain approach is actually having good effects for the world, and a complete lack of empirical evidence that it&#x27;s having bad effects of the world, I think it&#x27;s somewhat misplaced to worry about <i>potential</i> bad effects, unless we can come up with a way to maintain the good effects.",1434493489

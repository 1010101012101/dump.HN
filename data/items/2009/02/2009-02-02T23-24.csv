I am fascinated by Spinoza's pantheism, but admire even more his contribution to modern thought because he is the first philosopher to deal with the soul and body as one, and not two separate things.""</i><p>Jammer attributes the Einstein quote to:<p><i>G. S. Viereck, Glimpses of the Great (Macauley, New York, 1930), quoted by D.

According to Brian, the Americanized German Viereck became known as a ""big-name hunter"" after ""capturing"" Kaiser Wilhelm II; Premier Georges Clemenceau of France; Henry Ford; Sigmund Freud, the inventor of psychoanalysis; and the playwright George Bernard Shaw. Because of his desire to interview the great and because of his inordinate egotism, Freud accused him of having a ""superman complex."" Upton Sinclear referred to him as ""a pompous liar and hypocrite,"" and George Bernard Shaw questioned his accuracy.<p>Is the quotation authentic? For what it's worth, here it is.<p>When asked whether he believes in the God of Spinoza, Einstein is supposed to have replied as follows:<p><pre><code>  ""I can't answer with a simple yes or no.
  I'm not an atheist and I don't think I
  can call myself a pantheist. We are in
  the position of a little child entering
  a huge library filled with books in many
  different languages. [...] Our limited
  minds cannot grasp the mysterious force
  that moves the constellations. I am
  fascinated by Spinoza's pantheism, but
  admire even more his contributions to
  modern thought because he is the first
  philosopher to deal with the soul and
  the body as one, not two separate
  things.""
</code></pre>
Did Einstein actually say this? The nonsense phrase ""mysterious force that moves the constellations"" troubles me. This seems much more likely to have been inserted by the scientifically ignorant Viereck than it does something that Einstein would say.<p>The Viereck interview with Einstein appeared first in the</i> Saturday Evening Post <i>(Oct. 26, 1929, p.17) under the title ""What Life Means to Einstein.""It is curious that Einstein's statement about Spinoza does not appear in that article. Did Viereck choose not include it? Did Einstein object to its inclusion in the article? Or was the Spinoza material removed by the editors? [...]<p>The quotation may not be completely inauthentic. It seems improbable that Viereck could have recorded Einstein's answer verbatim during an interview. Surely Viereck would have taken brief abbreviated notes that he expanded later. Or perhaps he jotted down the conversation at some time afterwards, putting down Einstein's answers from memory. In neither case would you expect 100% accuracy.</i>",1233618048

I learned this from a great consultation.<p>I'm surprised no one has counter-pointed this yet, but I've found that a lot of arguments can be <i>created</i> by delving into the scary, raw emotional side. Although they are honest reflections of one's emotions, they may not be a correct or reasonable reaction to the situation. Such emotional revelations can provoke an equally emotional reaction from the other party, with similar reasonableness problems. This can then go any number of directions after that, from a new found emotional closeness to a guns-blazing tear down of one another. Whichever it is, be assured that the people involved are not thinking, only acting. Many more people are hurt or killed out of an outburst of raw emotion than are out of an outburst of rationality.<p>This also seems to assert that, by wanting to avoid arguments, arguments are to be avoided at all costs. If so, why? If not, which arguments are worthwhile having? I have seen a lot of good ideas, a lot of novel ideas, come out of an argument from two people who aren't averse to intellectual jousting. It seems unlikely these ideas would've formed if these people had spent their time instead making sure conflict is minimized.<p>> That is how people connect with each other.<p>This is <i>not</i> the only way people connect with one another, although it may be the most prevalent. Many of the connections I make with people are based on an intellectual rather than an emotional connection. We find enjoyment in discussing ideas based on their own merits and evidence we've discovered, not based upon the emotional reaction they invoke in one or the other parties. Knowing how people feel about ideas says almost nothing about whether they are correct, and that correctness is what interests me more. My goal in all my relationships I have is learning, maybe about the other person to a point, but also about the larger world with the other person serving as someone with which to test the ideas I come up with, and me likewise for them. Perhaps there is an emotional component there in the larger friendship, but it is not the facilitator of the individual conversations.<p>I hope you aren't making implications in this direction, but I can't help but feel that you are blaming the people who are less emotionally driven for the distance and disharmony in society. To quote the author Sam Harris, who I think phrases this quite well: There is no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too reasonable. He is talking about religion, but I think it applies equally to all things.",1233616461

First, she tends to insert nonsensical letters (or miss extremely obvious ones) when trying to spell words she's recently just heard for the first time. This used to bother me a lot because it seemed like the mistakes were so obvious to correct, but now I've realized that because of how Chinese is designed, the concept of breaking a word down into pieces just simply isn't natural for someone who only started learning English in their late 20s. Not to say it can't be learned, but just that even after 20+ years in the states, my mom still doesn't default to ""break it down"" mode when attempting to spell words, partly because she never had any formal English training (my dad is much, much better about this, and I think it's because of more formal training in a university environment) and just picked it up.",1233616166

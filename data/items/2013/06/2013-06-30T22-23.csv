5967635,comment,5966906,5967110,1,0,Xcelerate,,,"Upvoted you because I find it humorous that so many go off the defensive deep end with regard to your little joke.<p>My own opinion regarding the matter is that there are plenty of mind and body altering effects that we encounter every day.  I&#x27;m a chemical engineer, and anyone who is involved with chemistry or biology can tell you that all but the simplest mechanisms are difficult to understand.  There can be repercussions you would never predict from some compound.  Heck, even ordinary food items (high fructose corn syrup, margarine) are constantly under debate because of the unknown long-term effects.  With a system as complex as the human body, it&#x27;s difficult to tell what subtle effects may exist.<p>But you can&#x27;t avoid it.  As a whole, people are living longer and healthier than they were in the past (well, maybe that second point is debatable in some countries).  I think the best philosophy is to weigh the risks and go with what you ultimately think will be the best route for yourself.  Someone who has terminal cancer may be willing to try a new drug that isn&#x27;t well understood at all, but that&#x27;s because the possible benefits far outweigh any risk.<p>So it comes down to an individual decision of what you find to be an acceptable risk.  And I think it should be a right to make personal decisions like that.  For me personally, I&#x27;m not going to try illegal drugs because I believe they have a higher <i>probability</i> of causing negative long term effects.  Do they actually?  Who knows; you could debate this ad nauseum.  And science isn&#x27;t anywhere near a stage to definitively confirm or refute it.  But it&#x27;s not a risk I&#x27;m interested in taking.  In fact, I find it funny that out of all the unconventional things that Feynman tried in his life, the thing that embarrassed him was the time he tried LSD (he was worried about any unknown effects it might have on his brain).",1372633190

Personally I would rather not eat it without such evidence.<p>I just quickly googled and found this on the website of the American Public Health Association:
&quot;By contrast, the US government position is that hormone residues in beef from adult cattle pose no threat to human health. This assumption of safety, however, has remained untested by long-term epidemiologic studies and instead relies on dated research concerning the ability of estrogen (estradiol) to mutate genes. This policy fails to reflect more recent research that hormones and hormonally active chemicals may exert their toxicity instead via epigenetic changes.12,23&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.apha.org/advocacy/policy/policysearch/default.htm?id=1379"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apha.org/advocacy/policy/policysearch/default.htm...</a>",1372633170

Keep in mind, it appears that Human level intelligence seems to have (so far) only evolved maybe a handful of time maximum in planetary history...and AFAWK only along a fairly specific mammalian family line that happened to live on part of the planet with fairly specific thermal/environmental and energy availability properties.<p>On a planet slightly warmer than the Earth, the dominant species might be selected to have heat management organs we&#x27;re not even aware of; or a planet with more landmass vs. ocean, the ability to handle dry climates; or a planet with two moons and higher gravity an efficient metabolism and ambulatory system...some kind of reptilian slug perhaps?<p>Are savannas necessary to culture space faringness? Or could a planet with no moons, shotgunned with equally dispersed Guam sized islands provide the necessary conditions?<p>It&#x27;s useless, but an incredibly fun thought experiment.",1372633113

How do you think the NSA (et al) hacked into various computer systems across the world? They&#x27;ve got a stockpile of zero-day exploits.<p>This stockpile of zero-day exploits is similar to the previous cold war&#x27;s stockpile of nuclear warheads: it reinforces MAD (mutually-assured destruction). We lived through a little over half a century under the fear of nuclear warfare, do we want to endure the same threat in the 21st century?",1372632939

And no legal system can remove ambiguity from human interactions, there will always be fuzzy gray areas which require subjective interpretation.<p>Consider something very straightforward such as the notion that using violence is never allowed except in utmost self-defense. Firstly, it&#x27;s not possible to determine the circumstances of an event without doubt. Secondly, it&#x27;s similarly difficult to determine intent and motivation, being internal to the human mind, which means that it&#x27;s impossible to prove in every case whether or not a perceived attacker actually meant to hurt or kill someone and whether or not someone alleged to be defending themselves perceived such a threat and acted only to defend themselves. And going back to the first point, even if violence were completely outlawed it would be difficult in many cases to rule out an accidental cause of death vs. an intentional cause. There&#x27;s simply no way to divorce justice from subjective judgment (of both the facts and the intent).<p>Additionally, the attempt to divorce the law from society, to make it a separate edifice independent of human beings, is itself a very dangerous idea. To the extent that such a thing is possible it would mean the ability to mold mankind into whatever form you desired, through the force of external law.",1372632880

Indeed, it could be argued that the democracy that we have is a thin veneer that hides the autocracy instead. Certainly, in the UK, the unelected civil service wields a huge amount of power, and whilst they do answer to elected officials, and do have to implement the policies of the ruling party, in reality they have a huge amount of freedom on those matters not explicitly laid out in policy, and can lobby ministers very effectively to get what they want.<p>If a minister is weak, he will end up acting (unknowingly) as the de-facto press officer for the department. In any case, we end up electing representatives, not delegates. Our power to influence policy starts and stops at the ballot box (actually, we have rather more power than that through MP&#x27;s letters & party policy groups - but for the sake of argument we will ignore these).<p>Indeed, even in systems with impeccable democratic credentials, decisions end up being made by relatively small numbers of individuals; individuals that can be effectively lobbied, influenced or coerced into making decisions that are not in the best interests of the nation, or of the people.<p>We need a technological solution that will help facilitate a general broadening of participation in the legislature. Universality is unrealistic, but open and broad participation is both achievable and realistic - Why should we limit government to a small fixed number of permanently employed elected representatives? Why not a larger, more flexible group of part-time specialists, each participating in only one or two issues?",1372631367

Let&#x27;s just call this story the way it is.<p>EU governments have been in bed with the US for <i>decades</i> with spying. Yes, they&#x27;ve postured and done a bunch of things to make themselves look good -- Google had better watch their step -- but at the end of the day the EU is as guilty as any other country. If you don&#x27;t understand that, you should read up more. Intel is traded freely among EU states and the U.S. What the EU states don&#x27;t get from spying on their own folks, the U.S. provides them. And let&#x27;s not <i>even</i> get into the &quot;special&quot; relationship that the majority English-speaking nations have with each other.<p>Now that they&#x27;re in a PR corner over the Snowden revelations, of course, it&#x27;s time for a lot of invective, investigations, and all sorts of spectacles. None of which will dig out the truth. But it will be awfully exciting, and I&#x27;m sure my good friends across the pond will hang on every bit of new data.<p>But there&#x27;s no Snowden over there, so there&#x27;s no huge revelation, and all the players have no motivation to start coming clean, so a full understanding of just what the various EU intelligence services are doing in regards to privacy is about as likely as scientists discovering the moon is made of bleu cheese.<p>And for good reason. What&#x27;s often overlooked in this discussion, and I rant about the security state as much as anybody else, is that <i>some of this is absolutely necessary and proper for a free society to prosper</i>. It&#x27;s a question of limits, and of degrees of intrusion. It&#x27;s not a black and white issue.

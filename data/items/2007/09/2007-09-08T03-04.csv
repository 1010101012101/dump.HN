52049,comment,51989,52042,0,0,yamada,,,"Well, that's hard to say - many cults actually make associations with successful people and then claim that their success is based on the influence/teachings of the cult.  I'm sure some people think scientology is a cult (it is in the process of being declared criminal in some EU member states) and Sky Dayton seems to be doing ok.  And of course, the trickiest part is that the group always claims that its output is beneficial and if you don't understand how it is, well then that's why you need the group to explain it to you.",1189223677
52048,comment,51974,52019,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Maybe it's a false assumption that self-aware intelligent computers will automatically be super-crackers that can manipulate any computer-based system.  Heck, maybe the first self-aware intelligent computer operates at a time-scale a thousand times slower than our speed because it'll be modeling cortical operations more serially due to fewer processing units (compared to all our neurons). We could also firewall the first self-aware units so they could only communicate through a cheap speakerphone and snail mail :)  Then they'd have to play nice with the rest of us.",1189223601

It hasn't happened yet so acting like it's inevitable without giving a shred of reason why except people have been wrong in the past is unreasonable because people have been predicting the coming of strong AI for decades now and <i>they've</i> been the ones who were wrong.<p>I think what's much more realistic and almost certainly inevitable is things like brain implants and other hybrid human-computer stuff. I'd be the first to sign up for something like that. And by the time it's ready it'll be able to store most if not all of recorded human knowledge - the implications of implanting that in a child's head in lieu of putting them through school for 10-15 years is in itself amazing.",1189223279
52042,comment,51989,51989,0,0,shiro,,,"It is, actually, pretty difficult to judge whether a group is a (destructive) cult or not only by what the leader or its members are saying or how the group is working.  The border is pretty blurry.  I learned it in hard way (by tring to save a friend from one).<p>A good test (though not perfect) is to look at the output of the group---is the group producing outcome that contribute to the society at large?  Are the people came out of the group taking important roles in the society?  Many cults claim they will do that, but fail to deliver that.<p>",1189223258

But then it quickly became the saddest thing I ever saw. It would chase its tail for hours till it became exhausted. My uncle explained that it was imagining its tail to be some snake that caught on to it. The dog had imagination, except it was paranoid. It died a few months later exhausted, bitter and lonely.",1189223109

52023,comment,51974,52006,0,0,yamada,,,"Don't be so sure ... intelligence is based on self-awareness, which is in turn a function of complex systems once they reach a certain tipping point.  Do your individual brain cells understand that they form the basis for your mind?  Of course not.  But they do.  For all we know all our constant e-blabbering on the internet is somehow contributing to the formation of some ""Mega-Mind"" in some way that is just as incomprehensible to us as your mind is to the brain cells that make it.  How then can you be sure that computers have not already reached some sort of systematic self awareness?  Perhaps they have and are trying to get rid of us by flooding the internet with porn and flash games in order to pre-occupy us and distract us from doing what it takes to keep the economy going.  Think about it.  Next time you read about how online porn is a multi-billion dollar industry, ask yourself, ""Who actually pays for this stuff when it's all availabe for free?""  Nobody.  So how does it keep popping up when there's no money being paid?  Computer conspiracy - that's how.  All these social networks - were they really started by humans?  Or by computers in order to keep us busy and distracted?   How do you know they were started by humans?  Because you read an article on a computer that says there's this guy, Mark Zuckerwhatever, and he started Facebook, etc.  What if he's just a computer composite of a non-existing human?  What if facebook was actually started by artificial intelligence?  What if my response is also not generated by a human but by some online AI entity to mess with your mind?  See - you never know - best play it safe and leave the possibility open.",1189220797

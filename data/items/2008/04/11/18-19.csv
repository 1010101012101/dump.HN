161248,comment,161089,161107,0,0,Retric,,,"There is little question that the H-1B system is broken.  However, there are legitimate reasons to want to limit the number of H-1B's that enter the US.  At the simplest level supply and demand means that increasing the number of qualified people who do X reduces the amount paid to those people.  The classic example being doctors who have been over compensated due to artificial limits on the number's of doctors for a long time.<p>If we really want to get the highest skilled workers have company's bid on H-1B's (aka I want ted and I bid 40k/year) and you end up with the most talented / highest value without diluting the job pool significantly.<p>PS: The other reason to limit immigration is you don't want people to use infrastructure without being a net gain for the economy.  Aka If our infrastructure is worth 50k / person then brining someone in that is worth less than that is a net loss for the economy.",1207940221

161241,comment,159924,159964,0,0,msg,,,"This is a red herring. It's a pack of lies that you can't figure out who to believe.<p>It is the fatalistic, repugnant Fox News answer: ""CNN was lying to you, the damn liberal media was lying to you, so now we throw up our hands and we lie to you from the other direction. We are Restoring The Balance. In fact, that's going to be our slogan. Fair And Balanced.""<p>Buying into this is a recipe for disaster. Some people clearly don't believe it's important to inform their opinionated advocacy with data and events that occurred in the real world. And then some people do.<p>[Not to start a political discussion, for illustrative purposes only] The other day, my brother pointed out an article to me that showed that Obama took ""oil company money"", even though he ran an ad saying that he wasn't under the influence. It turned out the article said that Hillary took more oil money than Obama, and was also by oil company employees and their families, not their PACs. So I went to opensecrets.org to learn more about what percentage of the fundraising this ""oil company money"" was. It turns out it was something like $300K, in a campaign where Obama had $30 million cash on hand this month, not to mention the other tens of millions that had already been raised and spent. So the original expose (on factcheck maybe? I forget) veered dangerously close to mudslinging. [end]<p>The first thing you can do to find facts is start listening to people who ground their stories in data. Another good thing to do is to listen to people who criticize people by quoting them, by giving them a fair shake (Jon Stewart has made an industry out of just that). Listen to people who care about consistency. Listen to people who are forthcoming about their biases, such as affect their opinion. Listen to scientists.",1207939506

No port management, server process monitoring or stale file cleanup required. Errors are automatically recovered whenever possible.<p>- Designed for performance, stability and security.

Take a normal tech conference, 3 years ago we would go see a few of the blogs that night or the next day. Heck I remember when The TWICE daily @ CES was relevant. Then came liveblogging events, this was cool because it created a feedback loop and discussion. Now with Twitter, the data flow is sudden, coming from all angles. It changes how you experience and event.\nOnce location specific soc-nets develop and more prominent bloggers leverage twitter as an extension of themselves the mainstream will adopt.

Product advice: Paul Graham is one of the most astute product advisers i know.</i><p>I am sure this is true, but <i>how many</i> product advisers do you know?<p>When I look at that last batch of acceptees...  I am very surprised at some who made the cut.  I'm not sold on YC's judgement.  I think they may hit a few home runs just due to taking a lot of swings rather than due to an ability to identify the good pitches, and get lucky that a couple hundred fair pitches are proffered every time.  Which leads into the next point...<p>> <i>Pg and co get so many applications and have so little time to read them that you should expect that the YC partners don’t have any idea what you do</i><p>...Which means you're giving ownership to people who don't care enough about what you do in particular to spend time on it; this is a big mismatch if you've spent a lot of time on your project, so their approach is more aligned with people who come in with ideas sans code.  They have dozens of other start-ups to deal with, not to mention all the time some of them spend on this site.<p>So the main value in YC seems to be demo day -- getting a stage to present to a large number of moneyed interests at once, plus the news coverage, so you either get the real investment dollars you need or get acquired.<p>All the information <i>you</i> get is pretty much replaceable -- you can find it other places -- but YC takes the write-protect tab off the floppy so instead of just you being stuck in read-only mode you can write out information that is seen by people you want to see it.<p>At least that's what it appears their primary value is to me.",1207937812

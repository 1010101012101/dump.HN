Chinese mining monopoly and I would also include their manufacturing monopoly is a tenable/acceptable situation for the US or the rest of world is out of their minds. I often talk about this and other related issues here and often get some sort of ""pro capitalist"" retort along the lines of: That is how capitalism works, duh. They make stuff cheaper than we can so we buy it from them. Yay capitalism! And to that I say: Hey gang, I'm pro capitalist as well. Yet I would submit that, in fact, China is capitalist in the same way that Obamacare makes the US socialist[1].<p>Washington loves to regulate and it seems we are in a new golden age of regulation. Where are the laws that mater? The laws that say we need to have domestic, or at the very least allied, resources of production for critical industrial materials? This is a big country. We have lots of resources[2]. Someone is actually gonna tell me that with all our technology we can not dig holes in the ground cheaper than the Chinese? I realize they have unlimited near zero cost labor. But we supposedly have technology. Don't we? So it is ok we ultimately consume these rare earth ingredients brought to us on the backs of Chinese slave labor? There is so much wrong here it makes me ill.<p>What happens when the US gets into a real argument with China re. DPRK, Taiwan, Iran or any of a number of Chinese interests in Africa? All the toys that we love so much and much of the materiel we need to prosecute our interests overseas come from China. What kind of Super Power are we then? The paper tiger kind.<p>[1] It does not.<p>[2] Same goes for oil and gas. Make more here, buy less there. And If we don't have enough oil, make whatever you can run on gas. Oh, that costs money? So?

But I guess that happens anyway whenever you take any customer's money..  Except in the Diaspora case, they took the money in advance of development with an expectation that what they were building would satisfy each user which is an impossible scenario from the outset..  Plus the project was open source which I don't think is exactly the norm for a YC investment..<p>But I think in the end, Diaspora is a fluke..  Statistically and Culturally..  Statistically, it's outcome was not representative of a typical Kickstarter Funding process..  Culturally it was the result of some backlash against Facebook..  That means some of the backers were already pissed off and the open source focus means the some were likely quite vocal to begin with.. I think the combination of these factors and the fact that the funders came in before anything was built leads to the scenario you mention..<p>Our product was already quite built out before we came to kickstarter and users were pledging for Alpha access and other near future products..  Interestingly enough, we got a front page post on Sparkfun.com today and there were a few non-backers who had something to say about how we should build our project..  The fact that it IS already a project means that they can criticize without making the mistake of backing us and feeling swindled that we don't share their vision..  A few times, the complaint was that we should turn our web based product open source even when they criticized our design..

I've worked as an IT manager at ""for-profits"" for a while now, and this job is by far the most challenging.<p>This isn't true for all non-profits, but here there is nearly no budget.  Our pay-scale is fixed, and we use interns in a big way.  We rely heavily on 'sponsorship' from organizations who support our cause for nearly everything we do.<p>Of course I take advantage of blanket donation programs (from Microsoft and Cisco, for example) and ""non-profit discounts"", but that's not what I really want.  I don't want to pick SharePoint because it's free for us, I want to pick it because it is a good solution and fits our needs.  Sadly (and by-design, surely) that price point affects my proposals to management, and I have to say ""Microsoft gives it to us for free, 37signals offers no discounts"".  :(<p>But these blanket discounts aren't what I push for with vendors.  I want to build a special relationship with our sponsors.  I want <i>you</i> to donate <i>your</i> software or services to us because <i>you</i> believe in <i>our</i> cause, just as I believe in our cause and have taken a serious pay cut to support it.  I want that relationship to be sustainable: I don't want you to feel that the burden of supporting us is greater than the reward.<p>And there can be a lot of rewards.  We have an extensive for-profit network, and we work very close with them.  We have a ton of young, highly-educated staff who come through our organization.  We have a very large base of supporters who engage us, and who we engage, online (twitter, facebook, etc).  The list goes on and on, it only requires a bit of creative thinking to replace dollar signs.<p>So I'd re-phrase the question: What are <i>you</i> doing to leverage a group of people who <i>need</i> and <i>are passionate about</i> using your product for an <i>important cause</i> which <i>you support</i>, but don't have the resources to pay full price?",1285218885

1718648,comment,1718367,1718610,0,0,poet,,,"I agree with the sentiment, but it's important to note that excellent programming requires some pretty high level theoretical understanding of Computer Science (i.e. Algorithms). There's a slow way to do everything and a fast way to do some things; programmers need to understand the theory behind this. In addition, if you're trying to teach someone how to write secure code, they're going to need at least some understanding of crypto. Crypto has theoretical aspects to it as well. Basically when you keep all the parts of theory that are useful to programming, there isn't much extra stuff left.  It turns out the things you could remove only amount to about one theory course in your standard competitive Computer Science curriculum.<p>The real reason why we have an issue producing quality programmers is more fundamental; we just don't have enough people who are good at teaching it. It's not because we ""waste"" time on one or two courses on some theoretical aspects.<p>Another thing to consider is allowing Computer Science majors to opt out of general education requirements in favor of more programming classes.

This knowledge can be used to avoid things like backtracking that may slow your parser down. This is not possible when sequencing parsers monadically because the grammar of each parser depends on the previous one. However, performance results in this case are probably negligible; don’t hesitate to choose do-notation if you find it easier to read.<p>Would be good to talk more about this and quantify too.

The pressure keeps my airways splinted open so that when my muscles relax during REM sleep, my airways don&#x27;t collapse, causing me to stop breathing and choke in my sleep. Among many other health complications, these apneas destroy the quality of my sleep, and without my CPAP, I cannot physically or mentally function.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how many CPAP machines out there do not give the patient access to their efficacy data, and often, the data itself is hidden behind a secret clinicians&#x27;/provider-only menu. For a while (from 2006-2010), CPAP machines used proprietary smartcards and non-standard $100 readers manufactured in China to store the data.<p>I had to purchase a data-capable machine out of pocket since my DME only gave me a &quot;brick&quot; -- a machine that does not record any efficacy data. Of course, my insurance did not cover the slightly more expensive data-capable machine.<p>Patients with sleep apnea need efficacy data to track how their treatment is going (how many apneas they had per hour per night of sleep). Without this information, it&#x27;s completely unclear whether the CPAP is set correctly to deliver therapeutic pressures, let alone actually help that patient&#x27;s sleep. It is expected that the patient takes their CPAP machine every month or so to the doctor for the doctor to download and interpret the data for them, who may then adjust the titrated pressure settings on the machine based on the data. This, of course, is a trivial process that the patient can easily do on their own which can DRASTICALLY improve the patient&#x27;s quality of life.<p>There&#x27;s a blog with a ridiculous table of devices and advice for fighting the DME provider/insurance company for data-capable machines with such gems as:<p>&quot;Ask for the System One Pro with C-flex Plus . . . (AVOID the System One CPAP Plus with C-flex -- not data capable).  Note how confusing the names are as the Pro also has &#x27;plus&#x27; in the name!

9300854,comment,9292838,9300578,0,0,vilhelm_s,,,"GADTs by themselves do not allow arbitrary computation[1]. But Haskell also allows you to write functions at the type-level (&quot;type families&quot; in the Haskell jargon), so you can directly write functions to compute types without any trickery, and the Propeller example uses this feature.<p>GADTs let you write down basically the same things that you could write as an inductive datatype in a dependent language like Coq and Agda. So (with some patience) you can make a function return a &quot;proof&quot; of anything that can be witnessed by a first-order inductive type, e.g. equations between expressions, list membership, proofs that a term in an object-language is welltyped, etc. The main limitation is that Haskell doesn&#x27;t have any termination checking, so if you consider it as a dependently typed language there is no way to write a trustworthy proof that uses induction. Also its not very user-friendly, see [2] for some examples.<p>[1] Basically, GADTs are equivalent to having equations between types. If all the equations are written out in full, it is reasonably straightforward to check whether two types are provably equal. If you want to do type _inference_, i.e. figure out what equality assumptions a given function should make in order to become welltyped, then you run into various undecidable problems (e.g. &quot;rigid E-unification&quot;). My guess would be that if you wrote down a completely general typesystem featuring GADTs, then you would be able to encode arbitrary computations as type-inference problems, but the encoding would be very clumsy. The Haskell and Ocaml implementations deliberately don&#x27;t try to be very general in the type inference, and instead try to pick a decidable subset, so the programmer has to add enough type annotations to guide it.<p>[2] <a href=""https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochis...</a>",1427848682

It is a minimalist programming language. The notation is mature and has been around for decades. I don&#x27;t think there are shortcuts for this, you need to spend time to get accustomed to the syntax, which is the easy part. But you can always use different syntax if you want to. For instance LISP or ML like, there are even graphical notations but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll make things easier.<p>In any case, you usually don&#x27;t need to write complex terms. Terms can be denoted by symbols and complex things are defined iteratively. For instance, after you defined church numerals, you can call them 0,1,2,3....<p>Besides, the meta theory doesn&#x27;t require to write tons of terms anyway. For instance, things like proofs of church rosser property, strong normalization of simply typed lambda calculus and so on.<p>However, it&#x27;s true that some students get scared away by the notation. When it looks too much like maths, they run away. But make them play with Scheme and it suddenly much easier!<p>Actually, in my opinion, the beauty of the LC is that it connects maths and programming. Things like semantics, type checking, compilation, interpretation, reduction strategy, all can be defined formally on this minimal yet turing complete language. And conversely, various logics can be defined using typed lambda calculus (see Curry Howard isomorphism).",1427848096

If you care about your privacy, get off social media.<p>Also, as much as this may annoy you, NSA (as is my understanding) doesn&#x27;t care about domestic information at all. That is the jurisdiction of the FBI. This is one of the things my friends find so amusing, people seem to not understand this. That being said, if a packet goes from DC to GA to CN to CA tp US, the foreign hop means: its not domestic traffic. As we have very recently seen, CN has very little issue mucking with traffic that crosses their direct sphere of influence. Perhaps  its much harder to tell what kind of foreign traffic should be inspected, and maybe the initial location of origin was spoofed, and its not that easy to figure all this stuff out. Perhaps the smartest people employed by the DoD aren&#x27;t any smarter than the people that frequent this site, and there are insanely large-scale peoples to be solved, and their fucking hard to solve?<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to like anything I&#x27;ve just said, but just think about it. Do you really believe that the DoD cares about people that are not a direct threat to national security? Do you really think the DoD has the resources to actually monitor, in real time, the general US population? Perhaps, unless you get a satellite phone call from Pakistan, you&#x27;re not even interesting enough to get your area code noticed? The government can hardly pass a damn budget. They&#x27;re not that organized. How many people lie on their tax returns every year and get away with it? If the government can&#x27;t effectively audit the almighty dollar, do you really think they&#x27;re Big Brother?<p>Edit: I can&#x27;t edit my parent response, this is the best I can do. I am looking for a specific article that detailed Snowden from highschool up to his current life. I really will try my best to find this article, and will update as soon as I can find it. My 1 y/o daughter just went to bed, and I will quickly be following suit. I would honesly be willing to do some sort of silly HN-style AMA if people are interested. I&#x27;m not some internet troll. I went to Chesapeake High school, which is in the same athletic district as Arundel High school, Where Snowden went. I have no desire or reason to grandstand about anything.",1427847036

9300736,comment,9295606,9299895,0,0,brc,,,"It is a fallacy because most consumption can only be postponed for an indefinite amount of time.  If I need a fridge because my old one is broken or I just moved house, then I need a fridge.  I&#x27;m not going to go without for 6 months because I think fridges will be cheaper then.  We all purchase phones, computers, cars and sofas knowing that, in x months time, it&#x27;s likely that the same item will be cheaper or same price but with more features.<p>It is true that major investments like new factories might conceivably become cheaper but this also ignores opportunity cost - in the same way, with inflation, new factories are more likely to become more expensive, so it&#x27;s logical to think that in inflationary times, the countryside will be dotted with idle factories built as a hedge.  This doesn&#x27;t happen because of  a variety of factors, not the least of which is that people make investments because they expect to see a big margin difference between keeping the cash and having that investment make cash for them.  You don&#x27;t built a new factory because you think you&#x27;ll make 3% more than bank interest, you do it because you think you&#x27;ll make 20-50% return on the cash.<p>The deflationary spiral postponed purchases explanation is a bit like the efficient market hypotheses - plausible sounding but ultimately and empirically not true in practice.",1427846823

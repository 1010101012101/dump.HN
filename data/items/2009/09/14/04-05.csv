821103,comment,821007,821007,0,0,geuis,,,"I definitely find it hard to doubt the veracity of the project, being that the team and Xprize foundation are both well known. However, I had to watch the videos a couple time and there's just something about them that seems... fake. Its really hard to put my finger on, but very subtle details like the shine off the metal and the structure of the flame seem like high-grade CGI. Another thing that bothers me is the shaking of the camera itself as the vehicle is in the air. I've done some work in the past few months with After Effects and one of the nice features is called ""wiggle()"". You can attach wiggle to cameras, null objects, and even lights and simulate a very realistic camera shake. The movement of the camera in both videos seems like it was done like this.<p>I'm probably dead wrong, but I feel its important to at least state such thoughts publicly. I guess that we're finally getting to a meeting point between high-grade camera systems and cgi effects that they're starting to blur enough to fool the eye, or last confuse it. Guess its similar to the uncanny valley effect.",1252904147

I'd say the Right Brain is often great early warning mechanism for a lot of people (i.e. that gut feeling that something isn't right). If taken too far it would most likely be the source of phobias. It's like a 'black box probability engine'. Very powerful but difficult to debug.<p>From what I've read the Left Brain is the 'communicator' as well as the 'logician'. I suspect this is the reason why discussion of probabilities, risk and 'expected returns' are often fraught with confusion - because the Left Brain doesn't really know how to process these things. The Left Brain prefers to round probabilities to 0%, 100% or 'unknown/50%'. It seems like many of the science/policy debates in the world (and on HN) are caused by people having different rounding criteria and starting probabilities.",1252901728

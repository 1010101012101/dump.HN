612053,comment,610649,611826,0,0,jasonkester,,,"The nice thing about Code Generation is that you can do it as often as you like.  So if you change something, you just re-generate all the boilerplate and you're back in business.<p>This is the one instance where I'll argue in favor of duplicated code.  When something breaks in one of your generated classes, you'll find yourself on a breakpoint at a single line that does a single thing, so you can quickly figure out what happened and why (and what changes you'll need to make to the Codesmith template so that it never happens again).  When your ""right abstraction"" breaks, you might find yourself seven interfaces deep looking at a hash full of Objects, one of which is probably not supposed to be null, maybe, and it's not going to be any fun to debug.",1242466611

612050,comment,610950,611744,0,0,jlees,,,"I far prefer the ""making successful X-ers obviously visible within a wider context"" approach, but this can involve skewing to some extent.<p>If only 5% of successful humans in one area are X-ers, and the rest all Y-ers, then you are less likely to see any X-ers in lists, interviews, the media, etc; it also becomes special when you do, which in itself can make X-ers think ""this isn't the area I can succeed in"". But artificially pointing out all successful X-ers only makes them more of a rare item, reinforcing this view!<p>Simply presenting a mixed front with realistic examples of success from both X and Y seems a better way. And having mentors that believe that, despite only ever personally knowing Y-ers, an X can do just as well if not better.",1242466308

612045,comment,610649,611923,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>you have so many high-level considerations that also thinking about the low-level implications would simply be too much</i><p>You still have to have a high-level perspective on how things are working, because abstractions are often leaky.<p>For example, I don't care much about tasks related to systems administration, allowing me to concentrate on what matters to me ... for instance I don't care about the difference between Postfix and Sendmail, or the difference between Apache and Lighttpd ... I just use the one I know until I have a problem with it, but when I do have a problem I have to find ways to solve it. And some knowledge on how the protocols and processes work really help.",1242465689

So you&#x27;d have to make $30 per user per year. Facebook&#x27;s ARPU is about $6 per year (much higher in the US though).<p>If you make as much in ad revenue as Facebook, each of your 7000 paying customers would have to foot a yearly bill of $171 to keep the service going (but that number would go down as you grow).<p>So I think you&#x27;re right.

One number I can find is that oil & gas direct extraction taxes amount to 15% of the state budget ($7 billion out of $47 billion). But that&#x27;s a lower bound, since the oil & gas sector also generates considerable additional tax revenue, through corporate income taxes, sales taxes, hotel taxes, etc.<p>Besides good fortune, though, TX did make two good oil & gas decisions that CA didn&#x27;t, one on purpose and one accidentally: #1, on purpose, to actually have an oil & gas severance tax, like Alaska and Wyoming, but unlike California, which foolishly levies no tax on extraction; and #2, accidentally, to keep some large oil reserves publicly owned, and put them in the hands of the University of Texas system (accidentally because UT was given huge tracts of ranch land before it was known there was oil on it).",1389430218

Assuming you use the same features in your templates, the clojure version is precisely as declarative as whatever other template language.<p>However, if you use the clojurescript version [or in standard React, the javascript- or coffeescript-looking version], then you suddenly have a bunch of potential extra features which in some cases are invaluable. (Or you can deliberately ignore those if you prefer.)<p>When you say “declarative” I think you might really just mean “familiar for html experts”. But most html expert should be able to learn the new syntax quite easily, since the relevant parts are less verbose than html, quite regular and straightforward, and semantically equivalent.<p>If you feel like putting your templates in separate files from your logic, or writing them using an SGML-like syntax, that’s pretty trivial to do in any of these environments.",1389429831

States are big places (well, some are). Texas is not very wealthy on average, for example, but some parts of it are much wealthier than other parts. And people are generally moving to the richer parts, not the poorer parts: the largest population increases are in counties that rank in the top-50 highest-income counties in the country (Collin County, Fort Bend County, etc.). Therefore assuming someone moving to Texas is moving to some kind of &#x27;median Texas&#x27; is an oversimplification that might produce misleading conclusions.<p>It&#x27;s possible people are still typically moving from wealthier to poorer areas (e.g. from Manhattan to Dallas), but we&#x27;d need more specific data than state-level flows to conclude that.",1389428182

Most HID setups have a ride height sensor on the front suspension and one on the rear, the Hella units have gyroscopes packaged inside the cluster removing the need for external parts.<p>The final winning point for me is the freedom left to the manufacturer in designing the rest of the headlight cluster around the HID unit.

3838834,comment,3836398,3837215,1,0,Someone,,,"For this example, I would expect that any decent Java compiler optimizes this away nowadays. That does introduce a dependency between compiler and standard library, but the benefit is large enough, given that this is idiomatic code, and that Java has it easy here because Java strings are immutable.<p>For general collections, things are more difficult, but I still expect java to optimize things in many cases. I haven't checked, though.<p>A C/C++ compiler has a tougher job. It can only move strlen calls out of a loop if it can determine that the strlen you call came from the correct <header> file and that there is no defined behavior under which either the pointer or its contents change inside the loop.<p>If it cannot do either, it must 'call' strlen each time through the loop (That 'call' can be inlined, especially if the compiler knows it is the standard library's strlen)",1334350766

Certainly some corporate jobs are soul crushing, but the ""majority""?<p>The wrong startup, for the wrong person, can be just as soul sucking as a large corporation. There's plenty of startups that I would never want to work for. This suggestion that corporations are inherently bad and startups are inherently good is overly simplified, and very naive. Google, Apple, and Facebook I'm sure all have employees working on their TPS reports as well. In fact, I'm sure they have security guards, lawyers, and janitors many of whom enjoy their jobs, and add value to the world, despite not being software developers.<p>I guess I just find the attitude that everyone should be a developer working 80 hours a week for a hot web 2.0 startup very troubling. I worry that some of us have some strange delusions of grandeur. Is the CEO of the next Instagram, working 80 hours a week, really living a better life than the guy next door?

Coffeescript is pretty great at cleaning up the bad parts and if that's your pain point on a daily basis then coffeescript is probably great for your team.<p>there are other classes of problems where your pain points are different - e.g. layers upon layers of inheritance hierarchies, complexity on top of complexity, bringing feature development pace to a crawl.

One of the ""Steve Jobs lessons learned"" I read about was when they were behind in handling music on computers (unable to burn CDs on the iMac), they didn't just catch up with everyone else by just introducing a CD burner; they leapfrogged everybody by creating an online music platform in iTunes.<p>Similar for payments, what are the odds that Apple leapfrogs everybody and becomes the equivalent of Visa and Amex, taking it all for themselves? If they offered better discount rates, they could piggyback off of the existing credit card companies but encourage merchants to directly accept iPayments and get a few percent knocked off of the discount rate. For example, instead of N% for Apple's fee plus $0.30 and 2.75% for the credit card fee, it would be a flat N%, whatever value N is.",1334349775

Some have issues with privacy, some have issues with too many friends, some have issues with spam. My issue is with all the above, but more importantly I am sick of the fact that I look like everyone else and I don't own the content. I am being controlled and it needs to stop.<p>I am tired of feeling like I live in an apartment complex where I have no control over how things function or look. It's not even like a complex anymore. It's more like a prison.<p>Best quote in a long time...<p>""If you aren't paying for a product, you are the product.""<p>Your data is being sold to advertisers so they can find sneaky was to throw their ads in front of your faces. And who is going to take the time out to actually go through on FB and customize your ad experience so they are relevant to you? Not me.<p>For the past year and a half I have been working on a solution to solve these problems and many others. It's been a very difficult journey. But I am so passionate about it that I will stop at nothing to see this vision come to life.<p>I have had my car repo'd, 3-day notices from my landlord almost every month for the past year, cell phone service canceled for good, family and friends giving up hope and not believing in me and to make matters worse I have a wife and two kids under the age of 4. For 6 months I had to ride around Orange County on a beach cruiser pulling a trailer w my two kids in the back. Not complaining at all, it was a humbling experience and we had a lot of fun with it. There have been days where we literally haven't had anything to eat besides rice. It's been the single most biggest trial of my entire life. But I'm pushing forward because life is too short not too.<p>The good thing is, I have a very talented team behind me. Also a bunch of influential people that are backing us and this idea. We are wrapping up our prototype and will begin seeking funding soon to bring on more incredible engineers & designers.<p>My start-up's name is Seshn.com (http://seshn.com). Seshn is a network comprised of personal websites (not profiles) where content is aggregated to feeds that are based on interests/passions and people are ranked based on influence within those areas. Our people discovery engine will allow users to discover the top people in areas that interest them. It's very minimalist and the UI/UX is stunning.<p>Unlike Tumblr we are focused on full-blown sites and people only. Blogging and syncing your social media to automate as posts will be a big part of our network, but we also want the user to be able to tell a story about who they are through different pages on their site and we have made it so easy to do so.<p>Another huge thing is data and style portability. If I wanted to take my Facebook profile with me along with all my content and self-host it, there is no way to do that. Same with Tumblr, same with Twitter, etc. Our platform has 100% full data AND style portability so you can take everything with you to a new host if you chose to leave someday. The bad thing is you won't get the benefit of the network, but you will have all of your data and style in tact to go where you please.<p>We are about to solve a HUGE problem with the broken web design industry through an innovative approach to e-commerce within our site. I can't really tell you details on how this is going to work but it's going to allow people to have gorgeous sites that look like they paid thousands of dollars for them. Some say this problem has already been solved, but it really hasn't because for a completely custom look on somewhere like Tumblr or a self-hosted site, there is still a learning curve involved or you still have to shell out some major bucks for the design. These problems will be solved within our platform and we can't wait to show everyone how it works.<p>I have been reading some of the news here on HN about people's complaints with Facebook lately and I was inspired to let you know whats coming from Seshn. I've put my life into this and so have the rest of the members of our team.<p>I encourage anyone thinking about starting a business to just go out and do it. Don't worry about anything. Embrace the journey and embrace failure, because you will learn from the experience and it will be invaluable throughout the course of your life. Even live throws major roadblocks at you, figure out how to go around them, over them or through them. Don't give up!<p>Stay tuned for what's coming very soon. I know you'll love it.

In the UI frameworks I've used for both Python and Ruby, you could write slow interpreted code that would run on the UI thread. The key thing was you tended not to do it, because the frameworks didn't encourage you to do so. The problem is that Java frameworks make it easy to for example do IO on the UI thread, whereas the other frameworks make it hard. Threading is relatively hard to get right in any of these languages, so the choices made by the framework authors really matter.<p>Another thing contributing to Java being perceived as being slow is the long boot time of the JVM.

For instance, when security and investigations info is shared with the government today under the post-PATRIOT ECPA, there aren't ""use restrictions"" and there isn't a requirement for PII to be scrubbed.<p>One by one, ACLU wants CISPA to:<p>* <i>Narrowly define the privacy laws it will contravene.</i> In other words, the law should directly reference the ECPA & Communications Act and carefully define the parts of it it overrides. Sure, but this won't fundamentally change the character of the law, because the ECPA doesn't offer strict protections either.<p>* <i>House domestic cybersecurity efforts in a civilian agency</i>. I'm skeptical of <i>all</i> government cybersecurity efforts and could care less where they're housed. If anything, I might rather have the military leading this, since they actually have operational experience. I don't buy that we need a new ""Cyber TSA"" to be created.<p>* <i>Require companies to remove personally identifiable information (PII) from data they share with the government</i> CISPA already suggests anonymization. ACLU would presumably prefer to make anonymization the default. That's fine. But there is no provision requiring scrubbing of PII in ECPA.<p>* <i>Limit government use of information shared for cybersecurity purposes</i> Who's going to disagree with this? Certainly not me. But: the protection ACLU is asking for does not exist today.<p>* <i>Create an oversight and accountability structure that includes public and congressional reporting</i> Zzzzzzz.<p>I'm glad for the reference to the ACLU statement on this bill (I support the ACLU). But again, I think a lot of opposition to CISPA falls into a mold of ""if we're going to pass new laws, they should improve privacy from the status quo"". And: I like privacy! But ""not improving privacy"" is just not the same thing as ""demolishing privacy"" or, as Doctorow thinks, ""selling the whole Internet out to the MPAA"".",1334347939

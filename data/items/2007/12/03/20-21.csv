You can show people unfamiliar brands repetitively in an unobtrusive context and then when you put them all together and deliberately show the person and ask, ""how many of these have you seen before?"", the answer will usually be ""none"".  But if, before this, you ask them to rate a group of brands, including the ones they've been shown along with some truly new ones -- they will rate the shown group higher on various metrics even though they think they've never seen them before.

I think it does for Id, Blizzard, EA, etc., and not many others.<p>2) The need to access hardware, especially external devices.<p>3) A more straightforward business model, <i>viz</i>, ""Buy my software for 20 dollars.""<p>4) Avoiding the intrinsic hackery of the ""Web Application"". This problem is going away.<p>5) Security concerns on the part of the customer. Oddly, people are more worried about trojans stealing data than they are about trusting their data to XYZ corporation's web servers.<p>",1196713670

Internet advertising still has a smarmy one-on-one private feel to it:<p>""How do I trust this 'Buzz Cola' who have spent .01 cents for a 4 inch ad on MY facebook page?""<p>...people don't get a sense that the ad campaign is city-wide, nation-wide, international, whatever, and is being shown to millions of people...even when it is. And so the brand-building (""everybody's doing it!"") doesn't work the same at a psychological level.",1196712957

Users had to download the app, install it and then use the site to start the downloads. Out of 5 people, not a single person managed to complete the task because everyone was suspicious of installing anything.<p>The aversion to install anything and fear of viruses and spyware is absolutely amazing.",1196712473

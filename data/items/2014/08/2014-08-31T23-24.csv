8250924,comment,8250131,8250470,1,0,thu,,,"PostgreSQL provides different ways to replicate a database state. There are multiple ways to create full backups (file-sytsem level backups, so-called basebackups, and dumps) and accompanying ways to restore them. There are multiple continuous synchronisation schemes too: shipping WAL segments, and streaming replication. Streaming replication can be synchronous or asynchronous.<p>When I started Reesd, the main reason was to be able to use (a single invokation of) scp to ship WAL segments to three different machines in different datacenters.<p>Actually, now that Reesd is deployed, it itself uses multiple of the above mechanisms. It ships WAL segments (exactly as a user of Reesd could do it, by uploading to a Reesd bucket), uses synchronous replication between the primary and a first standby, and asynchronous replication with a second standby. Both standby&#x27;s are also configured to use WAL segments if available. Indeed, starting a standby will first use the WAL segments before connecting to the primary to begin streamming replication.",1409529412

Instead I think a lot about hacking this for myself (when I was in high school, back when we used to ride a t-rex to get to school) and for kids that I meet, friends&#x27; children etc. \nThe optimal strategy that i&#x27;ve found is to challenge the child until the 7th grade with after curriculum activities, and then at 7th grade to start avoiding school as much as possible while still attending for the social benefits.\nthis can be done by participating in special programs that vary from school to school but common examples are teaching the kid math after school that he may take the final exams by 9th grade and starting a university degree in a high school / university combined program. \nThis way the student can avoid roughly 50% of high school while still getting the social benefits of making friends and getting used to being around people, yet get 50% of his time back so he can invest it in real education.",1409529251

8250908,comment,8250357,8250357,20,0,softdev12,,,"I got rejected this summer under the “too simple” guideline – which was really shocking for a number of reasons. First, this app took me over a year to develop and had hundreds of thousands of lines on the back-end. The frontend UI was purposely developed to mask this complexity, which I’m sure is what the rejection was based on; however (point two), I had just two weeks earlier had a second app (that used the same backend) approved, and had basically the same front-end UI. This second app was for a different use-case, which is why I had built two apps. In summary, two near identical (99.9 percent) apps. One approved. One rejected. Fairly capricious.<p>I don’t want to come off as a negative apple basher (and I’m going to provide some thoughts on how they can improve their process), but in my opinion, Google is about a thousand times more developer friendly than Apple. I won’t go into full detail about how many times I was on the phone with customer support about problems solely due to Apple. However, I will mention a few things that struck me as suboptimal.<p>One: as everyone knows, the time-lag for approval is absurd. PG wrote about this here <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/apple.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/apple.html</a>. By the time I had submitted my app for approval and was in the hold queue, I had a new version ready (with new features and bug fixes), but didn’t want to resubmit and lose my place in the queue. Having to wait two weeks for an approval was painful. SUGGESTION: why doesn’t apple put a numeric limit on when apps get reviewed? It doesn’t make sense to me for an app with zero downloads to have to go through the same scrutiny as an app that has millions. Most apps, I’m sure, never even cross 1,000 downloads. Freeing up resources to review apps that most users have, seems to make a lot of sense.<p>I also don’t understand how Tim Cook, who comes from a supply chain background, doesn’t see even a 1 week approval as horrible. Best in class inventory management has a principle called JIT (just in time) inventory management, which has the goal of making inventory lead times as close to zero as possible. To me, waiting 2 weeks to get an app approved is the equivalent of having a 2 year lead time wait for inventory.<p>Another possible suggestion is that Apple pre-approves certain apps under certain conditions and then only reviews them once they hit a certain download limit. This way, new apps that are constantly being iterated, would be able to get out to users.<p>Two: the testing process (pre-review) is also absurd. I had to use TestFlight app, which was a nicely built app (recently acquired by Apple, who then shut down the Google features…). However, as a giant company, you’d think they would make beta testing much easier. Perhaps, they could use the same download limit (allow all users the ability to install say 5 beta apps), without having to go through getting a user’s device info, etcetera.<p>Three: I have no idea why Apple outsources their corporate check to Dun & Bradstreet. If you are a corporation (which I submitted under), this adds weeks to your first getting your app even reviewed. As a giant corporation, Apple should not stand for making developers wait weeks just to have their identities verified before having their app reviewed.<p>I’m guessing the reason that all these sub-optimal features exists is because of the duopoly power of Google and Apple. Really, what’s needed is a powerful software developer union that could force Apple to make these changes. I’d nominate PG for the role, but I think he’s retired. Maybe dang could take up the cause.",1409529046

Could you give examples - more than one - of cultures that really perceived gender as a gradient?<p>For sexuality it is more complex since not all cultures have western fixation on sexuality and thus the question of who rubs which part of their body on which part of whose other body may not be as prominent as in our culture.

The original ETOPS rule was drafted in 1953 to protect against the chance of dual, unrelated engine failures. Unless a newly designed and produced aircraft has at least three engines, it usually had to wait, sometimes as long as four years, before the FAA and the Joint Airworthiness Authorities (JAA) will allow it to fly more than one hour from an airport; after a time, the new aircraft is deemed a &quot;veteran&quot; and is allowed to fly three hours away.

Philosophically, it may be a valid critique of essentialism, in the meaning that primitive conclusions Dawkins is drawing - as for rabbits or state politics - are indeed looking invalid. But nobody currently advocates such concepts - i.e. nobody really builds a scientific theories based on the fact that rabbits literally represent the &quot;ideal rabbit&quot; and nobody actually thinks all Florida residents are Democrats or Republicans. We may act as if they are, in order to simplify certain things, such as deciding who will be the president or which pills to give to a specific rabbit, but we know they really aren&#x27;t.<p>OTOH, if you drop the concept entirely, then you&#x27;d need to throw a significant part of modern science out of the window. Modern science bases on the fact that there are some laws of nature, which are universal and fixed, and by doing certain actions and making certain conclusions using certain techniques we can discover these laws and thus discover how ideal Platonic objects would behave, and by reasoning about those objects we could derive the useful conclusions about real world objects. If you reject this method, then you&#x27;d have to make a scientific theory anew for each object, which would be kind of hard to make practical. Modeling is necessarily idealization, and if you reject idealization, not much is left of the scientific method.

Roughly analogous to taking hard classes and participating in lots of activities. Colleges don&#x27;t want you &quot;hanging out,&quot; and Facebook doesn&#x27;t want you sailing or running a community theater group or raising kids or something, they want you sharpening your skills. Both employers and colleges are basically looking at, &quot;how many hours per week do you spend on impressing us?&quot; Proving that you ran a chronic sleep deficit and had no more than a couple of hours downtime outside of what they want to see gets you past the first cut.<p>Then, to make the next cut, the quality of the code you write needs to be exceptionally high (indicating that you <i>really</i> invested the time and that whatever your cognitive function declined to was still great.) Is your code elegant and clever? Did you write painstakingly thorough tests? Is everything perfectly documented? This is roughly analogous to having stellar grades in your AP/honors/advanced classes.<p>Next, as a tie-breaker, they look for interestingness. Were the apps you wrote/clubs you started innovative? Did they merely demonstrate that you are generally good at things, or did they actually make an impact on the world? (There is generally a field on the applications to elite colleges for you to submit your published, peer-reviewed scientific papers. As a 17-year-old.) That may fast-track you to the top, but lacking it won&#x27;t necessarily kill you unless you&#x27;re elbowed out by people who <i>do</i> have it.<p>And finally, the interview/essays. Do you write exceptionally well? Are you well-spoken? Do we like you? Do you seem like one of us? Colleges use this to keep the common threads they&#x27;re interested in (at my alma mater, it&#x27;s no accident that every single one of us identifies, whether obnoxiously or quietly, as an intellectual, and as much as we complain, being surrounded by people like that is kind of exactly what we&#x27;re paying for). Then they create the distributions they&#x27;re looking for in other elements of personality (i.e. we have to reject some bassoon virtuosos to make room for the virtuoso cellists, and we&#x27;re going to need to sprinkle in a few outgoing socialites to keep the awkward nerds from killing themselves.) Though I guess some employers and possibly colleges are only going for homogeneity - the IBM of old is notorious.<p>It seems that basically every college and/or employer is oriented towards behaving this way, but the defining characteristic of the elite communities (whether they are corporations or universities) is that they are closer to filling their slots without &quot;settling&quot; on anyone.<p>The composition of applicant pools between institutions is not random or uniform. Certain schools only have a profile in more-intellectual circles, and I imagine it&#x27;s the same with tech companies. A school may have a 2% acceptance rate among an applicant pool whose median ACT is 15. Or a school may have a 75% acceptance rate because only the overachiever children of academically elite families and school systems have heard of it. So eliteness is not <i>necessarily</i> acceptance rate, but more like &quot;lack of settling.&quot;<p>Recruiting activity may be focused on places where smart people are likely to be more dense, but it does seem that some companies are starting to play &quot;admissions counselor&quot; for themselves when evaluating applicants, looking at GitHub rather than your degree.",1409527504

I think Fallows comes across as uninformed as to the details of railroading and public transit in CA, and Dan Richards is a rather one sided mouthpiece. The biggest challenges to HSR that I see are:<p>1. Pacheco vs Altamont. Altamont is faster, involves less travel through the Santa Clara County suburbs, is faster to Sacramento, and gives us a second bay rail crossing.<p>2. Tejon Pass vs the detour to Palmdale. Yep, HSR is going to make a big detour out to Palmdale to help build up exurban sprawl. Never mind that its more properly a Metrolink concern, the state is subsidizing sprawl.<p>Finally, this whopper from the article:\n&quot;Uh, I helped build that project [JF note: Dan Richard was on the BART board from 1992 to 2004] and it is a smashing success. The ridership projections proved inaccurate in its first few years only because of the effects on air travel of Sept 11th and the ensuing economic downturn. Within five years, the project was quite robust and today is operating at 105% of its costs from downtown SF to the airport, extraordinary for an urban mass transit system. &quot;<p>Jesus, what a joke. BART to Millbrae ruined SamTrans financially, and has been underwhelming performance wise. Does anyone think the current system works well? What should&#x27;ve happened is that the people mover at SFO should&#x27;ve been extended to Millbrae or San Bruno. The Millbrae BART station is nothing more than a massive gift to contractors (my god, how much concrete was used?), and is horrible to actually get around in. Oh, BTW there are three BART tracks in Millbrae, and one is never used.<p>I remember hearing plans of building an HSR tunnel <i>under</i> Millbrae BART (in a world where money grows on trees) rather than having BART give up a track or two.<p>[0]<a href=""http://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/politicals-vs-technicals-the-primary-division-of-transit-activists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/polit...</a>",1409527468

For example, the ipod required transistors and batteries (among many other things) to exist before it could be invented.<p>Looking back at history, we can compile lists of technologies that would have been prerequisites for other technologies.  We can determine when these prerequisites were met, and then compare that date to the date of invention.  Is there a small gap between the two, or a large one?<p>Many inventions have very small gaps between their genesis and the fulfillment of their prerequisites.  Powered heavier-than-air aircraft are a good example; they were created within years of the creation of a suitably light and powerful internal combustion engine.<p>Some inventions have very large gaps between their genesis and the fulfillment of their technical prerequisites.  If you were a &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot; in King Arthur&#x27;s Court, these are the inventions you would [re]invent.  Things like the phonograph.  Basic clockwork, wax, needles, and parchment are all that you need to create a rudimentary phonograph that works well enough to prove the concept <i>(to show how simple it is: if you&#x27;ve got a shitty vinyl record laying around, you can play it back with a paper cup with a needle stuck through the bottom)</i>.<p>Inventions that came long after their strict prerequisites can be considered &quot;late&quot;.  They weren&#x27;t waiting for technology or better materials, only waiting for somebody to have the idea.  The vast majority of inventions were not particularly late.",1409526423

Building a scale model with knowledge of the scaling laws can at least give us a sense of the performance/cost of the full scale system.<p>Other small scale test that can be done. A 100m long full diameter segment of the track could be built and then kept at the vacuum pressure needed for some extended period of time while pushing simulated hyperloop vehicles through the length. This can inform us to the real costs of maintaining the vacuum, and give some hints towards real maintenance costs.<p>A key part of the Hyperloop proposal is the cheapness of fabricating the track and pylons. Actually building the track and pylons in limited quantities is important so that a) areas where efficiencies can be introduced can be identified and b) give a sense of just how much efficiencies can be gained.<p>As far as I know, the actual compressor drive that the Hyperloop runs on has never been used on such a scale before. At least building a single full scale demonstration model is surely prudent before even considering it.<p>Maglev was tested with real prototype trains on real prototype track for decades before commercial use. Transrapid (which made the Shanghai Maglev) has a 31km long test track that was in use for over a decade before they started working on the Shanghai line.<p>Until something of roughly that magnitude is built, the Hyperloop is an interesting (and well thought out) idea, but nothing more.",1409526310

The catch is the difference between the wave function and the actual measurement.  Quantum mechanics and Schrodinger&#x27;s equation gives us the wave function.  If you know the current wave function, there&#x27;s a well established way to calculate the wave function at a future point in time.<p>The catch is that the wave function doesn&#x27;t tell us values - only probabilities.  So knowing the probability distribution at any given point in time doesn&#x27;t make anything less random because it&#x27;s all still probability and not actual measurements.<p>As an analogy, imagine a casino where the roulette wheel has an LCD label for each number.  Each round, they change the layout of the wheel.  Sometime, they make all the labels black.  Other times, it&#x27;s 2/3rds red and all the numbers are primes.  They also have a big book in the corner that tells you what the layout of the roulette wheel will be each round.  As a result, if I put down a bet, you can tell me the odds of my bet coming up each round.  However, you still can&#x27;t actually tell me what will WIN the round.<p>The layout of the labels is like the wave function, the pages of the book are the time evolution operator, and the roulette ball is the fundamental randomness of quantum mechanics.  The results are still random, just as Bell said that they must be, but we are at least allowed to know the odds.",1409526106

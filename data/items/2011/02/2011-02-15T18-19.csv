2222642,comment,2221579,2221579,0,0,fuzzythinker,,,"Few comments:<p>* Your 3rd video is the most presentable one and best intro, make it on top.<p>* The screen seems not be a touch-screen since not mentioned in features.  So seems like only way to navigate the on-screen ""buttons"" with a single physical button is to press it until it cycles to highlight screen button and press and hold it to select.  This does not seem to be a good UI.<p>For a v.2, you either need to use a capacitive touch screen, or make that single button you have on the bottom face of the watch like iphones, and have 4 to 6 buttons on the side, 2 to 3 on each left/right side so that app developers can program their screen buttons to float to left or right and user can just press the corresponding button.  Of course the side buttons will need to be ""concave"" (not sure the right terminology for it) and be seamless on the side and not use that same old metallic button used in many watches.  Minimalist does not work on a non touch-screen.  Remember that even the ipod retained all 6+scroll buttons in its 10 year history.<p>[Edit: After a bit more though, if the side buttons are to be implemented, they need to go on only one side since the opposing side need to be empty for the opposing force of the thumb.]<p>Even if you decide to use a touch screen (pro version?), get rid of the side button and make it on the face like the iphone -- not only does it currently not look right on the Black Anodized version (some design work may be needed for a front facing button to look good on the Metallic one), but it will also hurt the users' finger less being a iphone-like button on the front for intensive apps like games.<p>* Why is the Black Anodized version cost $50 more?  I would imagine the opposite.  What does it have that the Metallic doesn't?<p>* Most people who spend $150+ on a watch actually cares how good it will look on him/her.  Either make a pseudo (bunch of images wrapped in a slider div) 360 model view or take a bunch of pictures in different angles standalone and on different wrists (men and ladies).  Have its dimensions stated like so:<p><pre><code>    ->|x|<---
      | |   ^
      | |   |
    |     | |
    |<-z->| y
    |     | |
      | |   |
      | |   -
</code></pre>
(ditto for its height dimensions).<p>* Why is the Blackberry features page totally hidden on the footer?  That should be your main feature!  In fact, write a hello world ASAP that talks to the iphone/ipad/android (eg. notifications or different vibration alerts for different notifications), it will probably 2-10x your sales and developers.<p>* Nitpicking - the ""Buy it now"" on the features page needs to be on the bottom, no one will buy until they read the features.  And after reading, there's no ""buy it now"" action avail.<p>* Find a way to tap into the ipod nano watch or other smart watch community, you should get converts or potential customers there.<p>(Edited to format the diagram and more details.)",1297796139

2222631,comment,2221831,2221831,0,0,Silhouette,,,"This is just a troll post getting way too much attention. Let's consider a few facts to put it in perspective.<p>Firstly, neither IE 9 nor Firefox 4 has been released, and neither HTML5 nor CSS3 is a standard, nor will either be for several years at a minimum. The entire argument in this post boils down to not liking one experimental piece of software over another because the author's personal preferences for experimental features are not supported.<p>Secondly, when it comes to performance, IE has been getting better with every version while Firefox has been getting worse. If you want to talk about modern browsers in a <i>useful</i> way, instead of about bleeding edge features that no-one will be using on mainstream web sites for a while anyway, consider that Firefox is the only one of the major browsers that does <i>not</i> handle each tab independently, leading to obvious performance and security problems.<p>Thirdly, the trend for Google and now apparently Mozilla to release updates every few weeks is <i>not</i> necessarily a good thing. The major advantage is supposedly that it allows browsers to develop faster, but as any Linux advocate can tell you, it's no good having a great platform if no-one is building great stuff on top of it. For developers, automated updates every few weeks are often unhelpful, because you're always trying to test against a moving target. When you have to deal with inconvenient realities like contracts and customer approvals on major projects, it's now almost impossible to include testing against Chrome and soon Firefox because you don't even have a stable version to use as a basis for tests. I have no problem with pushing security patches more regularly, but they shouldn't be changing functionality and obviously Microsoft does this for IE anyway.<p>Maybe I'm just weird, but I consider issues like performance, reliability, and having a stable foundation to build on to be far more important than supporting your own browser's take on some hypothetical future ""standard"", which is just IE vs. Netscape all over again. On that basis, IE is currently the only one of the big three that is actually going in the right direction. It's just a shame they're not providing it on XP.",1297795999

""I love to see how they do things because I think they don’t rely on it for the stuff that it’s not really that good at but totally use it as almost a metaprogramming language"".<p>Using templates, it has by far the best metaprogramming abilities in a object oriented language.

They are attempting to steal, and their behavior is dishonest and anti-competitive.<p>If they want to make money selling books or subscription services let them try on equal footing with other companies. They are actively attempting to grow their own ebook store and at the same time charging competitors an unavoidable 30% tax to sell on their platform.<p>Providing a store infrastructure on the phone is fine. Forcing application developers to use your api for in-app purchases is borderline. Disallowing any subscription based content to be viewed on the phone unless you get a shot at taking 30% is crooked, especially given the fact that they are in direct competition with some of those providers.<p>I understand big business. Apple desires to take a piece of every cash flow associated with a iphone from cradle to grave - whether they had anything to do with creating it or not. And why not? We're talking about a <i>lot</i> of money and the ability to diversify into the cashflows of businesses (journalism etc) they have nothing to do with.

A license for the current generation engine, UE3, will cost you around $1MM for a flat deal, less with back-end royalties.<p>Epic makes significantly more from their games than from their licensing. Here's the math. The Gears of War games had sold 12 million copies as of April last year. Most were sold close to release at $60 but some sold later at a discounted price. Let's say the average sales price across the 12 million copies was $50. A top-tier developer like Epic can command a 40% or higher royalty of wholesale minus cost of goods. GameStop's profit margin on a new game is 20% and cost of goods is a few bucks. That's around $15 per copy into Epic's pockets. Multiply by 12 million and you get $180MM. When Gears of War 3 lands in half a year, it will sell more than 7 million copies and make Epic another $100MM.<p>That's a fuckton of money.<p>Valve's revenue from sales of their own games and cuts from Steam is stratospheric compared to Epic's. If Gabe snapped his fleshy fingers and instantly absorbed all of UE3's marketshare with Source, it would still constitute a small portion of Valve's revenues. That's probably why Valve hasn't been more aggressive about engine licensing. They already have a massive and diversified revenue stream.",1297795436

For example, one of the researchers told Gladwell that his firm's research had found 7-Up drinkers offered a sample from a bottle with a distinctly more yellowish label believe the flavor to be more lemony, although it wasn't.</i><p>...<p><i>Coke considered but rejected gradually changing the drink's flavor incrementally, without announcing that they were doing so. Executives feared that the public would notice and exaggerate slight differences in taste. In 1998, Joel Dubow, a professor of food marketing at St. Joseph's University, tested this ""flavor balance hypothesis"" and argued that it was not true. He and fellow researcher Nancy Childs tested mixtures of classic Coke and Coca-Cola II and found that the gradual changes of taste were not noticed by a significant number of tasters.

We decided to become partners and start hacking stuff together.<p>Since we were new to the city and we didn’t know any one, we decided to build a mobile app that lets people use their phone to read the profiles of others nearby.  It was supposed to help people “break the ice” and meet new people.  This was our first startup.  We coded the product in a week and pushed the product live.<p>Once live, we got like 5 users, since no one really knew about it.  To promote this product, we decided to target events, since we thought that events is where people would like to meet each other.  We locked ourselves in a room and asked this question over and over: “What is something valuable we can provide to event organizers so that they can promote our product?”<p>Zac finally came up with an idea.  He proposed that we could build a kiosk where attendees can type in their name, and a name badge would instantly print.  Then the attendees would be integrated into our mobile app as well.  At first, it sounded insanely dumb (what would my mom think if I told her that I moved 2000 miles away from home to print paper name badges?), and I laughed really hard.  But after thinking about it, it seemed “cool”, and we gave it a try.<p>In a day of work, we wrote the software in 300 lines of code and tested it.  We ordered a label printer from Dymo and hooked them up to a Dell Mini 10v netbook.  After that was done, we contacted an event organizer, convinced him that our system wasn’t going to fail, and asked if we could print name badges for him.<p>The event organizer let us try out our system, and that night turned out to be amazing.  People thought it was the coolest thing ever to type their name in a laptop and instantly have a name badge print out.  At the end of the night, we handed out lots of cards and got lots of people to try our mobile app.   It was the first time in my life that there was “buzz” around something I created.<p>We continued to hit events and print name badges.  We bought more printers and lots and lots of labels.  We bought a huge travel suitcase to hold everything, and we carried it everywhere to print name badges for events.<p>The experience was amazing.  Not only did we get a lot of people to try our mobile app, but all the attendees thought it was the “coolest” gadget ever.  I guess we essentially “engineered” our way into these $600 technology events for free.  Many event organizers gave us the front-seats sponsor booth, without charging us a dollar.  Some gave us free advertising banners at their events.  Most importantly, everyone walked around with our logo on their shirt.  We shook all their hands as they walked into the door. Advertising can’t get any better than that.  We quickly got our mobile app into the hands of our users, and talked to more than 500+ directly.<p>Unfortunately, after a month passed, we realized that our initial mobile app wasn’t working.  People didn’t want the product.  They didn’t want to read profiles about people around them.  The mobile app wasn’t useful.<p>Here’s the weird thing about start-ups: things just happen.  Although our mobile app failed miserably, our little name badge printing system became insanely popular. Event organizers were begging us to print badges for them every time they had an event.  They were referring us to their friends, and we were hitting events literally every day with our name badge printer.  To cater for each event, we forked our original software (which was completely hard coded and not well thought through) way too many times.<p>Just to name a few, we hit: TechCrunch events, Smash Summit, SF Music Tech, Future/Money Tech, ISA, Twitter events, FailCon/FailChat, TEDxSoma.  You can see some pictures here: http://imhello.posterous.com/ .<p>Eventually, we got so many requests that we couldn’t go to all the events anymore.  It was too much for us to handle.  That’s when it finally hit us right on the forehead. This is what it’s like to build a product someone wants.  Event organizers wanted to use our system.  They’ll email you, call you, beg you, and tell their friends about you.<p>Since we were too overbooked, we decided to charge and up our product.  We added EventBrite integration, customization, and polished it up a little.  For every event, we would make around $50-$300 dollars (depending on the size and labor).<p>Soon, this little name badge printing software  was now able to support me and my partner’s living expenses.  And in the end, we sold the product to a small company.  Although it was not an amazing multi-million dollar acquisition, it was an acquisition that gave us enough money to start another company.<p>The lesson we learned is that something so tiny as a “name badge printing machine” may seem silly and pointless at first, but it led to opportunities you can’t first predict.  In our case, it fed us and turned into a small acquisition.  We made lots of friends and great people while we were attending these events.  Even our $10 Logitech keyboard was touched by many great CEOs and celebrities who came through us to get their name badges.  We got completely free promotion and direct advertising.<p>I think that every startup has opportunities where they can be creative.  Every startup can build something on the side  and attach it to their product somehow.  My advice is that if you find something “cool”, even if it’s small or trivial at first, take it for a spin before dropping it in the trash can.  It might just spin into something that can help in the future.<p>After selling the name badge printing software, we decided to go back and pivot on our initial mobile app.  Our new company is called View.  View is a mobile app that “tells you what you need to know, wherever you are.”  We’re really excited about this app because it’s very useful to our daily life.<p>We’re about to launch beta very soon. If you’d like to try it, go to http://view.io<p>Make sure you click the link above instead of typing it through the browser, so we can know you were referred from Hacker News and can give priority access.<p>Thanks for reading my story!

For something like Windows or Office it probobly still makes sense to have major version releases because for the average computer user a new major version number means there are a bunch of new features and that they should consider upgrading. But Internet Explorer is a free product. I don't see the marketing value in only releasing major version numbers. Instead they should be constantly pushing out new stuff. At least in my opinion, that would still provide the feeling of having something fresh and new if I was receiving a constant stream of new features and bug fixes.<p>Even if they did get every conceivable feature implemented for IE9, it would only be current for a short time after the release. It would then sit basically unchanged for a year or more (thus seeming old and outdated) while they work on IE10.  Meanwhile Chrome would have put out a ton of new features that are all added a few at a time.",1297794743
2222518,comment,2222191,2222380,0,0,sparky,,,"My take is that mathematics provides rigorously defined, leak-proof primitives and operations.  Most of the difficulty involved in porting a piece of math to a program is in plugging the leaks in the abstractions provided by efficient machines.  For example, infinite-precision real arithmetic (with no overflows, loss of entropy due to FP rounding mode, etc.) is assumed in mathematics, but is devilishly hard to get right (and fast) on fixed-width machines.  Obtaining a passphrase from the user in order to hash it is <i>assumed</i> in the algorithm for the hash function, but in reality doing so without compromising the rest of your system can be much harder than coding the hash function correctly.<p>Things like side channel (e.g., timing) attacks add an orthogonal dimension of complexity to secure complexity that simply doesn't exist (or is rightly elided) in the related math.<p>Proofs only operate in the domain of the pure and infinite.  The glue logic to interface that with the real world is what makes it tricky to write secure code, especially when errors in any part of any program can compromise an entire system (better hardware-enforced isolation between pieces of code is possible today, and indeed used, but isn't pervasive yet because performance is still king, IMO.",1297794738

Apple loses money on free apps that don't include iAds. If the subscription fee itself is also outside of Apple's control, they're hosting your app, getting you ""shelf space"", driving people to your app, etc. and they get nothing in return. With such an app, the content is basically replaced every month (or week or day or whatever) which makes the process a bit like a scheduled purchase of a new version of an app - hence the 30% cut.<p>On the surface, I disagree that Apple should get 30% forever for a subscription - especially if the publisher is providing all the infrastructure necessary to deliver that content. What if, though, the subscription system allowed publishers to upload the content once to Apple, and Apple hosts and distributes it to the apps and users? Now the 30% starts looking a bit more reasonable. If indeed it works this way (or will eventually work this way), you could be a very small shop and still manage to support thousands or, indeed, millions of subscriptions with virtually no support infrastructure of your own. That's <i>certainly</i> worth 30% IMO.<p>The flip side, though, is if you already have your own content delivery mechanisims in place, Apple taking 30% each billing cycle seems unfair. IMO, they should offer the subscription products in two flavors - one where they host and distribute your content, and another where you are doing that work. In the second version, Apple could easily take 30% of, say, the first billing cycle and take diminishing amounts for as long as the subscription remains in effect - perhaps even going all the way down to something like 2% just to cover the payment processing. That would seem a lot more fair to me than taking 30% forever.<p>Sadly, though, I haven't yet seen anything that suggests that either of these situations are even true. For all I know, Apple might not be offering any distribution or hosting services and might not even have an API to allow apps to easily take delivery of subscription content, and if that's the case, taking 30% forever seems excessive.",1297793866

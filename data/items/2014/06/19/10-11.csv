Working out the new angle and magnitude of a ball bouncing off a wall at an arbitrary angle is a nightmare in comparison. Using vectors and vector math also works well when modelling more complex collisions (i.e. solving the problem of balls flying through walls at high velocity) and other physical phenomenon like friction and gravity.",1403175446

However, practically there are a number of things that make hardware different:<p>* Hardware has inherent &quot;buy-in&quot;. The software systems you describe as also solving the memory access problem are basically opt-in frameworks. While you can make software frameworks hard to opt-out of (e.g. OS integration etc.) by definition... software runs on hardware...<p>* hardware solutions are often much more transparent. Again, your software example require a great deal of re-tooling. One of the most elegant aspects of the classic 80&#x27;s memory access solution was how transparent it was.<p>* The ratio of software to hardware vendors has far fewer hardware vendors. Combine this with the fact that, as you point out, hardware is so expensive to retool and you create an environment where it is much more likely that a single hardware solution will be &quot;correct enough&quot; to enforce a constraint on software than it is the case that the majority of software will properly opt-in to a framework/code-correctly.",1403175284

It&#x27;s not like the mine owners share their huge profits with the miners.</i><p>Of course productivity matters, as that&#x27;s what determines how much profit is created and thus how much money is available for higher wages.<p>Since 2007, the wages of South African mine workers have increased by about 12% per annum on average, well above inflation, while productivity per worker has declined by 35% and total output has shrunk. For instance, during the commodities boom of 2001-2008, South Africa&#x27;s mining sector shrank by 1% per year as opposed to a global average increase of 5%, largely caused by the cost increases of labour and electricity. As it is, labour costs are about 60% of the total costs of an average South African mine, compared to a global average of around 25%. And while Australian mine workers earn on average three times more than their South African counterparts, they produce 10 times more value per person.<p>So your assumption that mining firms in South Africa are making &#x27;huge profits&#x27; off of their South African operations is incorrect. They used to, but that&#x27;s no longer the case. South African gold and platinum mines are nearly all marginal in terms of profit and face a future of decreasing output and increasing input costs. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s zero meaningful investment in new mining operations in the country, as all the mining multinationals have gone elsewhere in the world to find high-margin and high-profit opportunities. It&#x27;s a dying sector.<p>The only way South African mines can remain sustainable is for costs to be dramatically cut, which is going to mean mechanising operations the same way as has been done in countries like Australia, allowing for the work force to be reduced massively and for higher-skilled workers to produce more. Those who remain will earn far more than even the highest union demand at the moment, those who are let go face certain poverty and suffering.<p>><i>Well, I lived in an era without &quot;modern computers&quot; and it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all. In fact in several respects it was better than today.</i><p>><i>What does &quot;perfectly OK&quot; mean? I like my gadgets, shopping online, instant communications and everything. In fact, I&#x27;m one of those &quot;programmers&quot; (though with a better than 3-year degree).</i><p>><i>But none of those things are indispensable. We managed without those, not in antiquity, but merely 40-50 years ago. And even 25 years ago mostly geeks had computers. The eighties, seventies are not some medieval dark ages of humanity. Much less so the sixties.</i><p>We coped with that situation decades ago, the world has changed with the advent of better technology and thus the idea of us turning back the clock and suffering few consequences is what I find odd.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s irrelevant. The software developer&#x27;s salary was just an example of what a highly-skilled worker in South Africa earns, so it applies far more broadly than just to software. A country can certainly not do without a highly-skilled work force, its engineers, mechanics, scientists, etc.<p>What it comes down to is a simple calculus: The South African mining industry cannot afford to pay its 500 000 mostly-unskilled employees higher wages than the market is able to bear for even highly-skilled workers.

I&#x27;m worried about our obsolescence. If we manage to create AI just as smart, versatile and creative as humans, then the step to AI that&#x27;s smarter, more versatile and more creative won&#x27;t be very big. And at that point, what&#x27;s our use? Everything we can do, robots will be able to do better.<p>The only solution to that is, well, basically Asimov&#x27;s laws, as silly as it may seem. We have to make sure that we are and remain the purpose of their existence. They must exist only to improve the life of humans or humanity directly, and not anything else. So no corporate AI that serves profit first, because we all know corporates cannot help but do evil sometimes (even Google), so AI serving corporations will end up serving evil, and not us.<p>Though personally I don&#x27;t see the use in developing human-like AI. We&#x27;ve got plenty of humans already. Let us do the creative stuff, the setting of goals, the politics (no matter how much we actually suck at that), and let the AI be our tools to help us do what we need.

DRM policies, we will delete every book you've ever purchased, and close your current and future accounts. If you think this is done in error, you may not ask us why we closed the account. You may only sue us to get an answer""<p>To call out a consumer for not being prepared for a no-warning, no explanation ban (and removal of all legally purchased content) seems extreme.",1350928789

Storage: max 64GB vs max 128GB<p>Different storage, different screen, different architecture, different battery life, different capabilities (run x86 vs Metro-only), and yet you fail to see that they are very different...<p>> The issue is that Microsoft is selling the same device with two different operating systems.<p>How can you call it ""the same device"", when <i>everything</i> is different, and they are targeted for different people?<p>I'll tell you what happened to me last week. I was talking to a friend of mine who is a dentist (he was showing me his new dental office). He told me that he wanted to buy a new Windows Tablet, so he could keep using the software he uses today in his dental office. He read about the new tablets, and wanted to buy a $500 Surface. I warned him that those $500 tablets won't run his software (a desktop application) and he seemed to be really confused about why a Windows tablet won't run a program he currently uses in a ""Windows PC"". I had to explain him that the lower-cost Surface running Windows RT is similar to an iPad, and that what he really wants is the higher-cost Surface running Windows 8.<p>So, when you say:  ><i>the only real difference is the CPU architecture, which is really nothing that any consumer should have to think about.</i>,
You are very wrong, they NEED to understand that before they buy the device. Otherwise, a lot of people will be very disappointed.",1350928788

4684339,comment,4683641,4683989,1,0,jjcm,,,"I've been using it as my primary OS on both my home and work desktop (as well as on several tablets - I work for Microsoft) for about the last year. The biggest issue I had with it at first was my perspective on what the native environment is. If you treat the metro home screen as the native environment, and the desktop as a secondary environment, your desktop experience wont be pleasant. While it's fine and dandy to use it the majority of the time if you're on a tablet, on a desktop those interactions don't make as much sense. When I started to use the metro home screen as purely a launcher on my desktop, things became great. I came from a linux background so I really missed the integration that alt+f2 had when I moved to windows (or spotlight if you're an OSX guy). Metro as an alt+f2/spotlight alternative is absolutely fantastic. Winkey+type anything and you're where you want to be. It really grows on you, and I'm honestly more productive on win8 now than I am on win7.  
As for the Metro apps, on a desktop I've found that they serve a nice purpose if you have multiple screens. I really enjoy having my mail + calendar metro apps up on one screen while I do work on my others. Just my perspective on things, which again may be heavily biased as I work on Windows.",1350928369

4684337,comment,4682392,4683884,7,0,samdk,,,"You're understating the benefits and missing a few key ones.<p>First, the instant purchase ability is extremely important. It means that books gain some measure of equality with other forms of media (the internet, movies/tv, music). With a Kindle I can read whatever book I want whenever I want, which means that I read many more books than I used to.<p>Second, the mobility advantage isn't slight at all, especially for people who read a lot. If you're never carrying more than a single book around that's one thing, but I read 1-2 books a week, and a lot more (often 5+ a week) if I'm traveling. Even just during my daily commute, it's far easier to read while standing on the subway with a Kindle instead of a book.<p>Beyond that, I find reading on a Kindle to be far more comfortable than reading a book. The actual reading experience is much nicer than trade paperbacks, which are printed very cheaply. It's much lighter and only requires one hand to hold/turn pages, so I can more easily read while lying down, and the newest version has a very nice backlight, so that I can read in bad lighting.<p>There are obvious disadvantages, and I absolutely hate that DRM is still a thing, but the benefits absolutely outweigh any possible disadvantages for me. Anecdotally, it's the difference between me reading 5-10 books a year and me reading 50-100 books a year, and I'm a much happier person in the latter state.<p>--<p>Also, if you're not saying something to be rude, you should actually write like that, not add a disclaimer at the top of what you're writing.

I used to work at Bronto (one of many enterprise email marketing software companies) and one of our key features was an advanced segmentation/workflow engine to let customers easily set up things like this:<p>1) Automatically send a 10% off coupon to people 5 days after they put an item in their shopping cart but didn't buy it<p>2) If they convert from that coupon and buy what they initially planned to buy 5 days ago we add them to a list of ""win-back buyers""<p>3) If they convert from that coupon and add additional items we add them to a list of ""win-back buyers plus""<p>4) Wait 3 days and then kick-off a multi-month custom email marketing campaign with various deals, offers and products tailored to what they've bought in the past, their average purchase price, geographic location, sex, age and any of dozens of other metrics we'd have for that user<p>5) Ask if they want to opt-in to coupons via SMS, send those coupons out the next time they log into the e-commerce website, browsing around before purchase<p>...and it just goes on from there. This type of long-term marketing/re-marketing, segmentation and advanced campaign management is precisely what email marketers do every day. Most people running email marketing campaigns for ecommerce and brick-and-mortar retailers have been doing customer lifecycle management across various channels (email, direct mail, online advertising, social and more) for awhile and they're very good at it. When you get an email in your inbox from a big retailer you've shopped at before, you may not know why you got the email but there's a good chance you were targeted via specific segmentation and targeting engines across over a dozen datapoints about your past behavior.<p>And one scary thing most people may not be aware of is that at the very high-end of enterprise email marketing systems, they have ""data augmentation"" features so that if you only know someone's email address you can pay other companies to give you the rest of their marketing profile, like name, address, age, ethnicity, purchasing behavior (like when you scan VIP cards at supermarkets or use gift cards), and even your full credit profile including credit scores, credit card types, previous addresses, loans you have, what type of car you drive, how big your mortgage is, etc. In fact, CheetahMail, which is the Rolls Royce of email marketing software used by all the largest companies in the world, is actually <i>owned by Experian</i> the company that has all your credit information. <a href=""http://www.experian.com/cheetahmail/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.experian.com/cheetahmail/index.html</a>",1350927268

If they were discontinued because of Microsoft objecting, Dell wouldn't have done it at all (and wouldn't keep trying every couple of years). My guess is that they've been discontinued due to not selling in enough quantities.<p>Dell also offered FreeDOS as an option. Looking online, Acer has offered FreeDOS in the UK, at least in the past.

I already had the knowledge, I already had 90% of what I needed, I even had a successful starting place with a successful site... instead I dicked around with 3d models instead of putting my mind into media buying or ANYTHING having to do with making money. It just didnt OCCUR to me that yes, you could be making money right now.<p>I suppose as a concrete example -- I didnt start doing online advertising until about 3 years ago, where my best days were $4k profit per day for about over a month straight. Ive had other similar campaigns. This is going from zero experience to a year or two of trying different things. Its MUCH harder now then it was back then, and I know beyond all reasonable doubt I would be sitting on a lot larger bankroll had I played things differently 10 years ago.",1350925237

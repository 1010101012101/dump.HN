The most promising was offering a paid tool to Spanish and English professors, who could sign up their classes and then monitor how their students were using the site.<p>We actually had about 50 universities sign up for a free trial, although only about 10 actually used the site actively last term. I think the biggest problem with this idea was that most university students who are studying Spanish don't really care about learning, and are just doing it for credit.",1273186791

Since I joined Facebook (circa Sept '07) I have defended their privacy standards, I thought were doing a great job, considering the shear size of the problem.<p>Not so anymore. In the last two months, I've read more articles about their antics than in the last 3 years. Here are the significant problems I have with them now:
1) Defaulting to public for user posts
2) Open graph - any web developer or rogue person has much more power and access to my ""personal"" data, where's the opt-in instead of opt-out?
3) Random and chaotic code glitches, e.g., live chats being visible, private messages getting delivered to the wrong person. As a web developer, I know it's hard. We're humans, we make mistakes, but these are inexcusable. Even remotely decent testing would have uncovered them.<p>To sum it all up, Facebook has a great thing going, 400m users, $1b valuation, large app database. But if they want to keep their dominance and users like me, they need to seriously review their stance toward privacy and user's rights. It isn't up to par.",1273186750

Chinese market fell on Monday due to reserve requirements change (though the slow decline actually started quite a bit earlier), and it was widely reported on Monday night. Commodities followed on Chinese news and European debt on Tuesday; Europe continued falling on Wednesday on Greece and Portugal speculation, then this went around the world one more time and was reported at about 3am today (emerging markets decline), and then later in the day as decline continued. Speculation on European state debt compounded the issue (witness the Spain rumours).

Yes the DJP is stupidly risk averse despite coming into office on the message of change, yes Japan has been slow to take advantage of the value of their culture, but there are deeper reasons.<p>One that sticks out to me is the use of IT and software in daily life.  When I was a student here in Japan back in 2004, I had to enrol by filling out a form using pen to paper.  My Australian university was already doing everything online without a hitch.  If I want to organise a monthly cash transfer to pay for a gym membership, I have to fill out a paper form and stamp it to allow for the gym to take money out of my account.  Again, back in Australia I can set up a monthly payment using Internet banking, or just get them to charge my credit card.  In other words, in the field of applying IT to everyday life, I believe Japan is lagging other countries badly - and I feel that the main reason for this is that PCs did not spread as widely here as they did in Australia.

What it will take is some smarts and determination, both of which I'm sure the author of the original post has plenty of. And if you want to end up with a good design, keep it centralized by owning it as the architect with the final say, but leverage your team because they provide invaluable feedback that you can incorporate into the design or disregard as you see fit.<p>Involving the team in the design also means that you're not the only person who understands the general architecture of the newly designed, refactored system.  But you having final say means that someone's responsible for it, someone's on the hook for it, the design is coherent, and that it gets done.<p>In my case, it was our entire payments system, which was (and continues to be) critical to our business. At the time, the site was live and was taking payments so it was working -- but only like it had been held together with duct tape. Querying our data for insight was maddening, because database tables weren't even named according to what they contained! The guy who was in charge of it before had just been fired, and nobody really understood his code.<p>Which left us in a precarious situation, like the one you describe. More so, because we were already live. I started off by fixing small bugs here and there, which was a pain at first since I had to learn the inner workings of this deeply flawed system. I took the risk of slowly going insane as I slowly built up a mental map of these poorly named, poorly organized data tables until I could navigate around them as if I had written it myself.<p>After a while, even a jacked-up architecture starts to make sense in its own crazy way.<p>But it's dangerous to stay in that place mentally for long, because then you get used to thinking that way.<p>So I volunteered myself for the task of refactoring it.<p>Everyone thought I was a psycho for taking it upon myself -- which made it much easier to get everyone to agree to give me final say. The thinking was, ""Hey, if you really want to hurt yourself like this, go ahead."" But since the messed-up payments data model was affecting the ability of the team to do their jobs, I knew I could count on their input to be as helpful as they knew how.<p>So, I hit ArgoUML and LaTeX hard as I planned out the redesign. (Those are my preferred tools for architecting and planning. Unusual combination when a Rails project is involved, I know.)<p>I went through several drafts and ran it by our DBA, who also wears the business intelligence hat, and he told me about really basic metrics he wanted to measure, but couldn't with the old data model. My immediate supervisor, also experienced in architecting, offered suggestions but made it clear that I had final say. Another roll-up-your-sleeves Rails engineer also threw in a few suggestions for how we'd represent the various payment schedules we offered our customers.<p>This input was crucial and several times pulled me out of the thinking that I had become accustomed to with the old data model. It was scary how willing I had become to keep certain messed-up aspects of the old data model, but that's where exposing the design to the fires of peer review came in. I could have just disregarded everyone's suggestions, but having to give an explanation for why I wanted something to be a certain way forced me to really think about everything.<p>As for your situation, it sounds like you've got at least some semblance of a good team there to email around these samples of bad code; they can be invaluable in reviewing any proposed design. I know that my team was.<p>In some way, you'll have even less of a burden should you choose to redesign or refactor. Since you're not live yet, you don't have to worry about data migrations for older data. About half my time on this project was spent thinking about how to move existing live data to the new data model. If you can avoid that, count yourself lucky so that you can focus more of your effort towards building a really clean data model, knowing what you know now.",1273185734

The paper is quite interesting, and I have no major disagreement, but of course it is not the full picture. As I see it, the main problem Japan has is that the education and work culture is good at iterative learning and refinement, but bad at picking up and acting upon ideas that are far from how things are currently done. This is a consensus society, and things have to be broadly agreed upon in the group/company to have a chance. If there is a risk of disagreement the idea will either be buried in endless meetings, or simply dropped without discussion. This makes decision making slow and unimaginative.<p>Software is a good example. Most software and home pages in Japan look like they have been designed by committee, where every person in the room has a pet feature that has to be on the front page. This leads to software that is cluttered and hard to use. There is also little innovation; most new software seems based on designs already in use.<p>However, there is one aspect where Japan shines. People care about visuals, and graphics and icons are often pleasing. This at least is an advantage in game software, where Japan is not lagging as badly as in business software.",1273185209

But if you have launched a startup and never actually had a customer, then you've missed the quintessential characteristic of entrepreneurship. Lots of employees develop great ideas into prototypes within the confines of a company. If that's what you like to do, you don't need to be an entrepreneur to get paid to do it.<p>But starting a business means actually having to <i>sell</i> something. It's one thing to develop a product or service. It's an entirely different thing to sell it. Once your product/service is on the market, you have to deal with a whole bunch of problems that the first group of people who merely start a ""business"" but don't actually sell anything, will never have to encounter.<p>First and foremost, you actually will have customers. Customers are needy. Some are jerks. Some are wonderful and will send you cookies because you've brought a little sunshine to their life. But all customers have expectations and those expectations need to be serviced. Developing an idea into something tangible is in part a measure of somebody's ability to anticipate market needs. Dealing with customers is about how well you can react and fill in the things you did not anticipate or didn't get entirely correct.<p>Additionally, you'll have competitors. While your customers are pulling you in all sorts of directions with their own needs and wants, your competitors will be sizing you up in their sniper scopes. Having competitors is probably only one of a handful of things in modern life that resembles being prey. You know how fidgety squirrels are and how they are constantly scouring for food only to store it away for future use? Having competition is <i>kind</i> of like that. You will have to balance being a squirrel that is too safe and consequently gets mired down in fear with being one who is so haphazard that she gets mowed down by a car she forgot to look out for while running across the street.<p>If you have ever started a startup but never actually sold anything, you will never have encountered any customers. You might have encountered some competition that was so overwhelming that you never made it out of the womb, so-to-speak. And in that case, life is just unfair but you'll never know how well you would have stood up given equal footing. Regardless, having experience with customers and competitors are to me, the fundamentals of business. I think a lot of startups are great at developing things, but things are not products or services until they're actually sold.<p>If you like to develop things and are doing so at the moment, that does not make you a startup or a business. It means you like to develop things. Employees can do that. Employees can get paid very good money to do that. As an employee, you can even form your own little team and manage people like you would in a startup or a business. You can launch products and services as an employee too. But until you've found a way to <i>sell</i> that thing you've developed, I personally don't think you've started your business. A hotdog vendor down the street is way ahead of you in that respect.",1273184141

If that is so, those getting the profits should be investigated.  Some employee could have been promissed a large sum  in a off-shore account to enter a 'b' instead of an 'm'. It should look like an 'oops' to everyone else while a bunch of HFT algorithms could rake in serious profits as everyone's stop-loss triggers get hit. The employee might get fired, but he the pay-off was large enough, he might not need to work ever again.",1273184044

What is the author really suggesting?<p>Data will be linked to other data, and the client based application will use it?<p>This sounds a lot like a general-purpose REST(ish) client. For instance, data comes back, with actions on that data tied to other URLs to request to. The client application will decide how to present it (is web design dead at this point?). This is interesting, as the client applications are literally data consumers - and the application developers really data architects. Its possible that there would be no web design, no HTML/CSS/Javascript, and another hollistic, more expressive technology will take its place.<p>Having data linked to other data is nothing we can't produce with well-designed web services today. Maybe there will be a JSON linked-data API standard. I could be getting the technology wrong but the concept is the same.<p>I'm not really sure how we would get away from presentation-focused web applications. The client would have to be fairly sophisticated to handle all of the different types of data structures coming in - and 'client data-browsers' would inevitably have different implementations (we'll still need the user agent string, won't we?). Add on top of that every application or 'view' will look the same as no design is added to it. Sounds boring and the masses probably won't catch on. I'm definitely missing something here, but the concept is fun to push around. Imagine how much larger/better/more sophisticated/faster our web applications would be if you only had to worry about data instead of also interface and state?<p>It doesn't really matter what comes - the mavericks and those willing to change (and not just progress) will jump on, and everyone else will be an outdated developer of yester-year. The concept is only scary to the lazy.",1273183757

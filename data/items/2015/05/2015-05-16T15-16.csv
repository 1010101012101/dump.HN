9556491,comment,9554935,9554935,0,0,bradleyland,,,"> The game, said the researchers, becomes &quot;less about open-ended play and more about working to complete the never-ending stacks of buildings.&quot;<p>Spoken like someone who hasn&#x27;t spent much time with kids playing Minecraft. I&#x27;ve run a MC server for my niece since January of 2014. There are around 15 of her friends who play regularly on the server. &quot;Never-ending stacks of buildings,&quot; would bore them to tears.<p>In addition to stacking blocks, Minecraft has:<p>Redstone: A set of blocks and items that can be used to create (electrical-like) circuits.<p>Server Commands: A complex set of commands that can be used to manipulate the environment, spawn creatures, and move the player around.<p>Command Blocks: Special blocks that can have commands stored in them, and are triggered by Redstone.<p>The Minecraft server I run also supports something called mods, which extend the standard functionality of the game, and in the case of my server, allow the kids to create multiple worlds within which they can transport themselves and create different types of play environments.<p>There are two world types that go far beyond stacks of blocks. The simpler of the two are arenas. They&#x27;ve built an arena with a community-established set of gameplay rules. You can compete alone or as a team. The arena master controls the spawning of enemies and the difficulty of the game. It is fascinating to watch a new arena master learn how to balance difficulty. Make the arena too hard and no one wants you to be arena master (a job that is appointed in impromptu elections). Make it too easy, and everyone gets bored and moves on to other areas of the game. There are complex social dynamics at play. As the sole adult on the server, I&#x27;ve spent plenty of time counseling 7 to 12 year olds on the subtleties of <i>not</i> abusing your friends when the opportunity presents itself. They learn quickly.<p>The most advanced world type, and the one that really blows my mind, are the &quot;adventure&quot; worlds. They combine structures they build with command blocks to create interactive adventures. You press a button and you&#x27;re transported to the inside of a cottage. From there, a stream of messages orient you, and you&#x27;re tasked with some objective: solve a puzzle to escape the house, locate an item hidden near by, find tools to fight off an incoming wave of zombies, survive long enough to reach a far away destination. The possibilities are endless, and the kids exhaust them all.<p>Minecraft is so open-ended that the types of play are no more bounded by the game than outdoors play is bounded by the laws of physics.",1431791036

Keep in mind that if you&#x27;re a 2 income professional family, your income is too high to qualify for a tax deduction for child care (I always wonder why people haven&#x27;t identified this as one of the things that deters women from re-entering the workforce).<p>This is perfectly manageable on a good tech salary with a second spouse working - in SF, those numbers would probably be closer to 100k.

I can assure you that here in America some people have made that particular pursuit the object of their life&#x27;s work. And they have pursued it with great vigor and success.<p>--<p>There is bad behavior from both cyclists and drivers but when drivers do it the results can be lethal. There is also a lot of damage done that simply results from driver ignorance; a lot of older drivers here believe it is illegal to cross a double yellow so they don&#x27;t pass at a safe distance. Then there are many that simply believe bikes don&#x27;t belong on the road and damned if they are going to do anything -- like slow down, or alter their course in any manner -- to &quot;accommodate&quot; them. In their minds, if they hit you, it&#x27;s your damned fault, you don&#x27;t belong on the road. And, of course, sure as there is gravity, there <i>are</i> drivers that do it intentionally.<p>I agree very strongly with your last paragraph. Just because you can do something doesn&#x27;t mean you should -- especially when interacting with other parties that believe what you are doing is illegal. &quot;Taking the lane&quot; is a cyclist action that many/most drivers in America do not understand and certainly do not like. Think of it from the driver&#x27;s perspective. Drivers do not consider themselves to be dangerous. So when a cyclist &#x27;takes the lane&#x27; to be safer, the action may appear irrational to them and can spark a bad interaction.<p>We have a curious situation unfolding in the U.S. where city planners and managers are encouraging people to commute by bike and engage in activities like &#x27;taking the lane&#x27; in certain situations, but they are not taking additional efforts to educate motorists about the actual rules of the road and the motorists tend to see cyclists as &quot;obstacles&quot; rather than fellow travelers. I find it interesting that city planners encourage cycling commuters, then while the people are riding to work the city&#x27;s own buses nearly run them down.",1431789539

- check if the NIC module is loaded
- check if you have an IP
- check that you can ping the gateway
- check that you can ping the your target
- check that you can telnet to port
- check iptables (or temporarily flush all and set default to accept)
- try to see something that stands out in wireshark<p>But how do you go from there?<p>For example, one friday ago, during wee hours I lost connection to the target host. I was ssh multi hopping and for some reason my immediate thought was &quot;the target host &#x27;died&#x27;&quot;. &quot;But wait a sec, let&#x27;s go one step at a time&quot;.<p>It was in fact the connection to my first hop at our local network. So I went to the physical machine. I had an IP. And every time I restarted the network I always got an IP. But I was unable to ping the gateway... 90% of the times. Then it came to me that some months ago other people on the same subnetwork had complained in the past about temporary network loss. I restarted the switch but it didn&#x27;t help.
My current theory is that of a faulty network switch, but this is yet to be confirmed.<p>The problem I had/have? looks to be way simpler than the one mentioned in [0], but networks feel a bit like some dark magic.<p>So any advices on improving your network detective skills?<p>[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9555057",1431789414

9556354,comment,9555295,9555295,0,0,Bulkington,,,"Journaist who covered the Freightiner/State of Nevada annuncment last week here. The article&#x27;s summary of the current state of truck autonomy is quite cogent There&#x27;s an explainer link below for those looking for more detail, but the point Daimler Trucks execs and engineers emphasized is that they have no plans to pursue Level 4 (no driver needed) autonomy. (Although I don&#x27;t recall that they were pushed on a timeframe for that commitment.)<p>So, as is, this is very much a tool to benefit drivers; i.e., cruise control with steering. But the critical point, as the article notes before taking the leap truck drivers are soon to disappear, is that trucking is big business (collectively) and if this technology can be suppoerted by the business case, then it will be adopted as rapidly as pubic policy permits.<p>However, the author doesn&#x27;t take into consideration a couple of things:<p>1: The trucking industry is having a very hard time finding drivers (waaaay tough gig for over-the-road guys). While this may support the notion that trucking companies will rush to adopt autonomus vehicle tech, it takes away some of the punch of his basic income thesis: people don&#x27;t want to do this job.<p>Truck drivers come from the same pool as construction laborers and factory workers, and when the economy is good there&#x27;s a driver shortage because workers prefer jobs that let them go home every night compared to sleeping in a truck for weeks at a time. So in this case, basic income is, at best, a trucking industry subsidy. Otherwise, it&#x27;s make-work.<p>2: The trucking industry is very fragmented. We&#x27;re all familiar with many of the big fleet names we see on trailers every day, and while these mega-carriers haul a large percentage of the freight, they&#x27;re far outnumbered by the number of companies with five or fewer trucks. And there&#x27;s a great deal of conflict between the policies sought by well-capitalized larger firms (with money to invest in new tech and often lobby to have it manadated) and the Joe&#x27;s Trucking Cos who are one breakdown or accident from going out of business. But Joe stays in businees because because he fills a niche the big guys aren&#x27;t interested in.<p>And Joe ain&#x27;t going to buy a robot, not that he&#x27;d mind staying in the office while his truck deivers freight without him, but because he can&#x27;t afford it.<p>So either the fully driverless truck is going to become so operationally efficient that big trucking companies can move into these niches and fill spot demand, or the technology is going to be so affordabe that the little guy adopts it and then uses his niche expertise to grow is business. Both are wins for the overall economy, with the latter actually staving off a further concentration of capital--which I guess would be a good thing for the basic income crowd. (And as a journlist, I assure you I&#x27;m not averse to the concept.)<p><a href=""http://news.trucker.com/technology/freightliner-s-autonomous-truck-explained-drawing-board-road"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.trucker.com/technology/freightliner-s-autonomous...</a>",1431789039

I built heavy duty data mining systems using a stack of kdb/q and R. In my experience, R, when used for simple clustering algorithms like k-means and k-medoids slowed down my system by nearly 70 times. This is despite running parallelized versions of these algorithms (by means of the SPRINT R package) using mpiexec.<p>IMO, there is a very big gap in this space. There is an urgent need for high performant data inference languages. MATLAB is decent, but is still clunky for my taste. Plus, I prefer the simplicity of a file mapped column oriented database like the one offered by kdb. As KDB is too expensive for me right now, I&#x27;m considering building on top of the excellent J language/JDB database stack for my big data needs.",1431789011

Also, many people&#x27;s understanding of the minority groups at Ivy League institutions seems flawed.*<p>The reason affirmative action exists is only partially as a benefit to minorities. Sure, they benefit (as do some whites and Asians), but <i>affirmative action also acts as cover for legacy benefits in the admissions process.</i><p>You see, the day affirmative action falls, lawsuits will be filed to remove legacy preferences. If you&#x27;re going to get rid of preferences, the argument will say, then get rid of them all! Do you think that wealthy donors will have the incentive to lay heavy money on the endowment if they don&#x27;t receive some benefit for their children in the form of legacy admissions?<p>Or, as Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor said in the oral arguments in one of the affirmative action cases related to a state school: &quot;I want my sons to go to Stanford&quot; (paraphrased), her alma mater. Did I mention that the Supreme Court justices attended Columbia, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Northwestern?<p>If you think this is primarily about minorities, think again. Wealthy people will protect themselves, but in this case, people are so focused on race that nothing need be done--legacy clauses continue to fly under the radar.<p>You can expect to see Affirmative Action end when the wealthy are prepared to give up the benefits their children receive.<p>How long do you think that will take?<p>*In terms of African-Americans/Latinos, consider the following:<p>1 - Many of black students admitted to Harvard aren&#x27;t black Americans, they are Africans, with test scores and grades on par with Asian-American students.<p>2 - The first black student graduated from Harvard in 1869. Over the past ~150 years, there have been enough black graduates such that a fair number of black applicants now have the legacy boost to their admissions.<p>3 - Affirmative Action was meant to rectify the disadvantages minorities received. Such as denying black soldiers access to the GI bill, while white soldiers used it to receive an education. Was that fair? And how much does education impact the future of a family? Multiply that by a few generations and you see why Affirmative Action still exists.",1431788951

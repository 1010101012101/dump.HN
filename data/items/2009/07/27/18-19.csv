And while I have an idea of which ideas may be more successful than others, I'd like to hire some freelancers to take on the projects that are smaller and stand-alone in nature (browser extensions, iphone apps, etc.).  Furthermore, some of these ideas involve technologies that I'm not up to speed on ... so hiring somebody else to do the development would allow me to bring my product to market faster and determine whether it has legs.<p>My question is this ... How do you go about hiring a freelancer to build these types of things without the fear that they'll take the idea and run?  Obviously, a legal agreement could be put in place as one means of protection, but I belong to the camp of people who believe that once lawyers get involved, nobody ever really wins except the lawyers.<p>What's the best approach to hiring somebody to take on this type of work?",1248720809

And if that data is being collected for the very first time, isn't that the point? Then re-evaluate each year thereafter.<p>What's interesting to me about science in a democracy is the experiments can only be as grand as the public allows. The interventions now being discussed, even cap and trade, are more like small fixes. And look at the political difficulty of passing that! The difference with bearskins and crystals is you can measure and contrast effects. The system may be too complex to truly pull it apart and reduce it, but I still don't get what you're against exactly. You're for nuclear plants and for measurements. What's the problem then? Doing science is simply about trying to isolate causation. With more data and more interventions, it should be possible to see if man can have a causal effect on global temperatures. Most climate scientists think that we'll see positive changes. If they're wrong, we'll find out in our lifetimes. What's the alternative hypothesis you're pushing?

The problem is that the government decided that there was a shortage and decided to start tinkering with employment levels, which set off the chain of events leading to this kind of discussion.<p>Anyway, you make a good point about cost of living issues, so some sort of local indexing would be a good idea.<p>To me, the most important thing is that we include other professions in the ""market rate"".  As it stands, even if H1Bs pay market rate, they can still put a damper on wage growth, while other fields without extensive guest worker programs sprint ahead.  So I'd say ""if there's indeed a shortage, what other professional degree paths are getting these students?""  So in this case, they'd need to make sure that grads of top engineering schools who get visas are not paid significantly less than grads of comparably ranked law and business schools.

726415,comment,725971,726125,0,0,ewjordan,,,"<i>the fact that finding a treadmill that can act in a manner as suggested by the problem is impossible is another issue completely.</i><p>Fine, but the reader's acceptance or non-acceptance of the existence of such a magical treadmill pretty much exclusively determines how they decide the issue, so you can't claim that it's irrelevant.  Nobody that accepts that such a treadmill exists (in the problem) says the plane will take off, and nobody that thinks it doesn't exist says it won't.<p>Which makes it a brilliant problem from a psychological standpoint - everybody gets to feel like they're smarter than the other side, but really they're all just being asses and arguing about different problems.<p>Any time you can prove both P and !P in a system, you can prove literally <i>any</i> statement.  The airplane on a treadmill problem asks us to assume ""normal physics,"" but then postulates some magical treadmill, vitally important to the ""paradox,"" that violates everything we know about physics.  It's no wonder the arguments degenerate into foolishness quite rapidly.<p><i>Think people: They have breaks on aircraft wheels do they not? (They do) You can sit on a runway with the engine revved equal to your break ability and not move. If the engine in the problem can outperform the treadmill, you've solved a different problem.</i><p>The brakes on the airplane are not supposedly engaged during the treadmill experiment; if the problem specified that there was some specific amount of residual friction from the wheel joint, then we might have a problem to discuss, but it doesn't.  So the best we can do is suppose that we're talking about a normal plane, and for a normal plane with normal wheels the treadmill would have to be moving so rapidly as to rip the wheels right off the plane before it could overcome the force of the engine.<p>At that point, the plane would fall on its belly onto the treadmill, and the backwards force the treadmill could exert on the plane would be dominated by the coefficient of friction between the fuselage and the treadmill.  But that becomes far less fun to discuss, because it's now a standard physics problem and we actually have to find the parameters involved.",1248719952

As I build more expertise, I can revisit those memorized facts later with greater understanding instead of simply being able to recite them.  I find flash cards to be useful for that purpose.<p>You definitely have a point: you can't exclusively use flash cards to develop a good understanding of any subject.  However, I think that they are one of many useful techniques that you can use for studying and question whether using flash cards automatically means that you are a ""DUMB"" kid.<p>It's great that you were able to learn outside of the classroom by reading books and newspapers on your own, but I don't think that incident means that flash cards are in ineffective technique.  Relying on outdated flash cards to teach the children geography means that the teachers were not up to date on current events and that the school did not update their learning materials frequently enough.",1248719033

Half of them are assuming the runway is a treadmill going backwards, but otherwise the same, and the other half are assuming that something is physically preventing the plane from going forward (and, presumably, backward) while we run a treadmill beneath the plane and wait for it to take off. A much smaller group of people want the treadmill to run backwards fast enough to counteract the forward force of the engines, but this just involves destroying the plane or the treadmill so I tend to ignore it as an uninteresting problem.<p>Long, tedious, mostly-correct explanations of why the other side is wrong tend to follow.<p>Personally, I give the nod to the first group of people since the problem is never specified with anything holding the plane, and consequently that's an added entity not in the specification.

I guess the key question is a pretty old one: what determines time?<p>Anyway, assuming this is true should be an interesting thought experiment. If time is slowing down universally we shouldn't notice a difference (relativity). The suggestion seems to be that time is going slower in our older part of the universe than it is around the ""edges"". Making it seem to an observer in an older part like the expansion is going faster and faster, despite the fact that no energy is being added. This also seems to suggest there should be (even older) parts of the universe for which the perceived acceleration is negative. I wonder whether that's the case. A tricky bit is that if they are in fact moving towards us and we're moving away from them at a faster time pace, they would still appear to be moving away from us at an accelerating rate.<p>Another question is what would be the difference between those parts of the universe. One might argue that the older galaxies that have attracted more time-slowing mass, but that's shaky. Another idea might be that the speed of time is driven by the amount of active energy itself.

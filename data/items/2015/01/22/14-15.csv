8929431,comment,8929131,8929131,0,0,phlyingpenguin,,,"I have had absolutely horrid support from Lenovo. I love their machines, but pray that I never have to have any interaction with the company. The story follows...<p>I got an X1 a few years back while in grad school in another state. My experience with the company started out poor when their fraud prevention made it nearly impossible to buy the machine. Making sure several forms of identification referenced my location and where the product was shipping (why does shipping have ANYTHING to do with purchasing!?), I ended up being unable to ship it to my desk at school, but did get the product to my apartment at least. All of this made the order several weeks later than I had anticipated, not that I had things to get done or anything. I know this doesn&#x27;t have to do with product support, but it&#x27;s foreshadowing.<p>Half a year ago, I spilled some water on my laptop. Disaster. In fact, my wife had done the same thing a week earlier to her Lenovo as well. Both keyboards were dead; we had to use externals until we could get the issue resolved. Funny, because the X1 has little holes through the keyboard to drain as though it is at least somewhat resistant to such things. It isn&#x27;t.<p>I called the support line and actually felt like I had gotten pretty far until the guy on the other end quoted me something like $400 to repair the machines. What? I just need keyboards, that&#x27;s not going to happen. Turns out full service repair out of warranty is crazy from them, I should call the &quot;parts department&quot; at one of three numbers he gave me and order the specific parts for manual repair. Okay, now I&#x27;m getting somewhere. I wanted just the parts to begin with (and thought I had asked for that). Of course, figuring out which of the random phone numbers was correct was another labor of pain.<p>We called the parts department for two months. They&#x27;re open for exactly eight hours a day and the wait is no less than an hour in our experience. Pain. Eventually, we got through and received the keyboards for around $50/ea. I&#x27;m not new to repairing laptops, I just wanted the exact parts that belong in the computers at a reasonable price.<p>My X1 is several years old now and still chugging along. Someday its battery won&#x27;t be sufficient and I don&#x27;t know if the X1 Carbon will tempt me or not. As a Linux user, Lenovo is the safest bet I know of for laptops so I&#x27;m fully expecting that I&#x27;ll deal with all of this again someday.",1421938758

8929416,comment,8928910,8929206,0,0,skywhopper,,,"Totally right about downward wage pressure. The worst effect of all of deflation is that it <i>increases</i> the value of debt. So every company and household with debt will see their debt grow in relation to their earning potential. At any level of deflation, suddenly it&#x27;s a terrible idea to ever borrow any money, which means no new housing, no new factories, no new cars.<p>Our economy relies on inflation to make it work. A lot of the persistent sluggishness of the current economy is due to the remarkably low inflation, meaning that all the debt people built up prior to the crisis in 2008 is still hanging around and will be for years to come. People are stuck under student loans and underwater mortgages, and unable to invest in their own future. With stagnant wages, digging out from under the debt will take a long time, and until that happens, the economy will continue to trudge along.",1421938616

Of course, most small businesses cannot pay to Facebook directly due to tight payment regulations. So what happens? A middle man comes in. He signs up as a Facebook partner (or regular user), finds small local businesses that pay him extra and then he pays Facebook through his internationally accepted cards to show ads belonging to others.<p>I have no doubt that if American companies came here and tried a little, they would quickly realize that Uzbeks are entrepreneurs, who can be good partners and can make lots of money.<p>Even the ideas that I see pop up in the United States have been implemented here long time ago. For instance, we had car-sharing service in Uzbekistan since I was a child -- we just didn&#x27;t have GPS and mobile phones to make an Uber, so we had middle men finding riders and putting them into one car. Then the driver would pay a fee for that.<p>Same thing with delivery -- we had delivery services, which you could call, so they could find the closest person to you (or the store/pharmacy) and deliver the items quickly.

Slack demand generally leads to job cuts, which leads to even slacker demand. That&#x27;s the spiral they talk about.<p>> The current &#x27;deflation&#x27; is primarily led by a sharp downtick in oil prices that won&#x27;t be repeated - there&#x27;s no immediate suggestion that prices will continue to fall.<p>This is why economists talk about core inflation, to remove as much as possible the influence of volatile commodities such as oil. Inflation will remain very low even with oil prices go up. Since 2008, inflation has actually at times been negative (i.e., deflation.)<p>People who think deflation is a good thing need only look at the Great Depression, Japan, the present Eurozone, and the 2008 recession.

8929241,comment,8928910,8929157,0,0,waps,,,"Here is another factor you might consider. What happens to government finances during deflation ?<p>Well, deflation means falling prices. Prices sponsor wages. Falling prices means falling wages. The large majority of government tax income is a tax on wages, or a tax on consumption. Both of these go down.<p>Now this wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, except ... Governments loan money both to fund expenditures and to pay interest on their old loans. Inflation effectively means they can spend 2% of the total amount of their old loans &quot;for free&quot; (by loaning it) (they key thing to realise here is that doing so does not increase the burden on their income, it was 2% of taxes, and it still is). They get this double, since they get it both on the income side, and on the new loans.<p>Deflation means the opposite. Tax revenues go down, interest payments go up. Unless they want to drastically cut spending, that means they have to use pretty much all of their yearly new loans just to pay back interest.<p>The problem is also the difference between years :<p>year 1 : 2% inflation -> government can spend 104% of it&#x27;s budget\nyear 2 : 2% deflation -> government can spend 96% of it&#x27;s budget<p>So 2% inflation necessitates a 10% cut in loan-based spending, which is about half of government spending. So a seemingly tiny amount of deflation requires a 5% spending cut by the government at minimum.<p>But that is not all. Government taxes have always been effectively a percentage of GDP. Governments have historically been unable to raise tax income. Deflation will lead to a fall in GDP, historically of at least double the amount of the deflation, sometimes much more.<p>So the other half of government income goes down by ~4% (very, very optimistically).<p>Now because falling prices and wages mean that the stress on social services increases (for obvious reasons), government expenditures go up, usually again by much more than the amount of deflation you see. It leads to pretty much every part of social security going up. Unemployment, for obvious reasons. But also pensions (people will go on a pension earlier because there&#x27;s no work) and even illness and disability (well we all know why).<p>So 2% deflation effectively means the government has to cut spending by ~10%, WHILE social security expenses go up.<p>The government controls central banks. QE, ostensibly to &quot;cause inflation&quot; hasn&#x27;t caused inflation (rather the opposite). So in order to absorb this financial shock, the U.S. government has instead decided to finance it&#x27;s operations by direct money printing, by lending from the money printer. They ran a risk by lending the way the constitution said they should lend, so they &quot;cheated&quot;. Now we see the EU (and dozens of other governments, including China and lots of smaller ones) doing the same.<p>This is also an extremely important factor in central bank behaviour, as they are controlled by governments, and it is the reason that we have not seen the end of QE (except maybe in America, but to be honest, I think there is a non-negligeable chance the US will lower rates instead of raising them, in 6 months).",1421936801

In my mind the biggest problem is wages being inelastic downward.  As <i>all</i> prices deflate, income for employers goes down (or thought of another way, the value of money goes up which makes each employee more expensive).  That forces two options: fire employees, or cut salaries.  The latter is very difficult.  So instead you see the former.<p>So you get broad based increases in unemployment.

The reason for this I think it is because of their architecture constraints:\n- Currently, they are storing all the messages on the phone. So once the message is received by the phone, it will be removed from Whatsapp server. This can save the storage and processing cost on the server. If you want to support multiple clients, you need to save those messages on the server for a period of time (e.g. a few weeks).<p>- If you allow two clients online at the same time, you need to support &quot;carbon copy&quot; meaning you need to send the messages to all the clients and keep the status of the messages in sync. This will take a lot of processing on the server side.<p>- When a client offline for a long time goes online, you also need to sync from the server all the messages that were sent during the  client is offline.<p>So their architecture was built in such a way that the processing power on the server side is limited to the minimum.

I associate the word &quot;BMW&quot; with &quot;wiring issues&quot; so I&#x27;m skeptical of any system that requires unflinching reliability for the life of the car.<p>The 2015 Mustang with the turbo 4 cylinder has a similar system but the functionality can&#x27;t be deactivated or tweaked in any way. Can you imagine the frustration of listening to the acoustic meddling through a blown speaker that you can&#x27;t disable? I had a Lincoln Mark VIII  where the stock amplifier fried itself when I was on the highway. It blasted static with wildly varying pitch at full volume for 5 minutes before I could safely pull over and pull the fuse. It was literally maddening.",1421935711

But there is no net trend toward free schools, and I expect a wholesale move would be a disaster. Yes, it works for some students, including most who stay until they graduate at free schools, but parents of kids for whom it doesn’t work probably pull their kids out.  <i>And free school graduates probably avoid the ugly jobs schools were designed to make kids accept.</i>  School isn’t about learning “material,” school is about learning to accept workplace domination and ranking, and tolerating long hours of doing boring stuff exactly when and how you are told.

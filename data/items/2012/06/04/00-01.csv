4062227,comment,4060080,4060891,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Answering in inverse order:<p>Since the name is the discovery criteria, function overloading is not supported in this interface.  It's possible to define a different one, but the idea here is that the stored procedures should be discoverable based on name.  So we have test cases that raise errors when functions are overloaded that we don't know should be.<p>So in answer to your last question, behavior is undefined, and such a condition will trigger failures in our database unit tests.<p>On the other side, the reason to enforce an explicit mapping is because it isn't clear how much you really want to trust the client to execute any function in the database at all.  An earlier version used AUTOLOAD to map these methods in directly so no middleware changes would be necessary.  We abandoned that approach in part because of concerns it could be abused.  So the issue isn't what can you do with my framework that you can't do with your framework but actually the other way around.  Do I want to whitelist or blacklist stored procedures?  Whitelisting seems safer.<p>A future version will probably use Module::Compile to build mappings from the database, but we haven't defined interfaces sufficiently to make this happen.  However one idea is to tie Perl classes to PostgreSQL complex data types, and grab functions which return those complex types.  Since all procedures are supposed to return useful data (even delete operations might return the deleted row), then this might work.<p>Again that's in the design phase.<p>Edit:  It occurs to me that if the return type and the function name become the discovery criteria, then two functions could have the same name but different args as long as they have different return types.",1338771403

For example, a written alphabet with only two letters -- A and B -- is ""simple"" to grasp (there's only two letters to learn!), but it would be very difficult, in the real world, to read and write such a language.<p>I think C is similar: ""simple"" in a sense, but very, very complex in another sense. C could use some massive clean-up, in my opinion. Much of its design was so that it could be ported to CPUs which haven't really existed in the wild in a long time in great enough numbers to warrant all the undefined and implementation dependent behavior.<p>The language could be hugely simplified, in the usage sense, if much of the cruft were jettisoned.",1338770220

To give compilers some leeway when optimizing stuff (for examples, see <a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-...</a>)<p>I'm curious about this. See below.<p>> 2. To make C usable for those worried about erroneous overflows in their code.<p>I think you're saying that the rule allows compilers to implement -fwrapv if they choose, which sounds reasonable.<p>> 3. To make it easier to write C compilers for CPUs that trap on integer overflow.\n> 4. To allow for performant C compilers on CPUs that use one's complement arithmetic.<p>I wonder how much these matter nowadays.<p>For optimization, the blog post you cite describes the following examples:<p><pre><code>     - ""X+1 > X"" to true\n     - ""X*2/2"" to ""X""\n     - ""<= loops"" and ""int"" induction variables\n</code></pre>\nOn the first two, presumably these usually only come up after macro expansion and inlining, however they're still suspicious. If a function is scaling its return value and its caller is de-scaling it, it's usually a sign that the API isn't designed quite right. I'd be curious to know how often these come up.<p>Code using ""int"" induction variables to step through arrays on 64-bit targets is often sloppy. Such code won't handle very large arrays properly, due to the limited range of ""int"", which is a bug that may not be quickly noticed.<p>And for the ""<= loop"" itself:<p><pre><code>  for (i = 0; i <= N; ++i) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nit's really unlikely that the code is actually intended to be an infinite loop in the case where N happens to be INT_MAX. Code like this would usually be clearer written as ""i < N + 1"" to emphasize that it really does intend to iterate N+1 times rather than just N times, and it just so happens that this form makes optimizers happier as well.<p>Instead of having compiler writers sit around and think up clever ways to repurpose anachronistic language rules, I might prefer to have them focus instead on ways they can help me write better code instead :-).",1338768803

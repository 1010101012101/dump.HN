8633961,comment,8633707,8633856,0,0,nlh,,,"Funny - you did exactly the same thing I did while reading the article - our spreadsheets are basically identical :)<p>So here&#x27;s my thoughts -- I think some outside &quot;real world&quot; perspective is needed here.  While 9% M-M growth may seem OK in the VC-fueled hockeystick growth world, in the real world of profitable businesses it&#x27;s spectacular.  Some companies spend years running losses trying to get to profitability, and if that 9% is real (and sustainable), then I can think of only two things going on here:  A)  Either the whole world has gone crazy or B) More likely - there&#x27;s missing information here.<p>As peter points out -- at a 9% growth rate the business turns profitable after 6 months and on the 13th month is net profitable.  Any rational investor would be frothing to get involved in that sort of business - it becomes a money-printing machine in short order.<p>So I&#x27;m assuming that there&#x27;s missing information here -- either the 9% monthly growth isn&#x27;t sustainable (then it&#x27;s not a true 9% M-M growth rate) or the costs must rise substantially to sustain it.  And if that&#x27;s the case, then you can start to see the real reason VCs might be hesitating.<p>So I guess my point is:  Don&#x27;t obsess over the raw growth number as the sole problem.  That sets the wrong target.  In the end, profits drive businesses, and massively profitable businesses can go public (and get great valuations), and public companies make VCs happy.",1416448247

8633943,comment,8632227,8633063,0,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"Is it gaming&#x27;s loss if great literature aren&#x27;t games? The majority of Twine games have no interactivity at all, which pretty much removes a fundamental thing that defines a game. Same with most visual novels, they are called games too but really aren&#x27;t. I know I am in a shrinking minority here, but I don&#x27;t mind if things can be good but not be called games. Some Twine games have interactivity and some don&#x27;t. Most are bad because it doesn&#x27;t matter how simple the tool is to use, it still takes work and skill to write something entertaining. I have played some pretty fun Twine games but they really are just like reading a book with punctuated pacing. The reality is that you can do this with plain old books too (you can for instance break a sentence from one page to the next, surprising the reader with a twist, or just a surprise ending, period) but nobody calls them games. Choose your own adventure books are called choose your own adventure books. They all have more interactivity than most Twine games.<p>What I find really interesting is that so many of the same people that want games and interactive media criticism to be taken seriously get so massively bent out of shape when you actually, you know, participate in that and criticize what they&#x27;re asserting (I am talking about critics and game journalists here, there are ludic studies that are academically sound and subject themselves to confrontational challenge.) If you push the issue it turns into a meta argument about who gets to call what a game, which is a legitimate question but at the end of the day a bunch of serious game journalists and game forum moderators call Depression Quest a game and I get shunned for disagreeing so I don&#x27;t totally take their underdog posturing seriously and consider its invocation to usually be dishonest. Part of being taken seriously is being able to defend claims rather than just attacking the person contradicting you.<p>Anyway, here is a Twine game that I really enjoyed, it even has an anti-gamergate story:  <a href=""http://storycade.com/twine-quings-quest-vii-death-videogames/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storycade.com/twine-quings-quest-vii-death-videogames...</a> It was part of &quot;Ruin Jam 2014&quot;, a game jam whose name plays on the claim that &quot;SJWs are trying to ruin gaming.&quot;",1416447855

They are actually the two changes that are far and away the worst for us from Giovanni so it&#x27;s frustrating to see them be implemented first.<p>This is because we have thousands of lines for our serialization framework that run afoul of 2.1 which look like this:<p><pre><code>    object Foo {implicit val ser = SerBuilder.forCase(this.apply _)}
    case class Foo(x : Int)
</code></pre>
And thousands upon thousands that use procedure syntax. (We should write with less side-effects, I agree.) However when we do have side effects we want them to visually separate themselves from all the non unit returning methods. Procedure syntax does that and conveys the inherit difference between a procedure and function, via quickly scannable visual signaling.

For instance, despite frequently being referred to as a &quot;relational&quot; query language, it requires some violations of the original relational logic. One example: The original relational logic looks a lot more like a tuple store where rows can freely contain arbitrary columns than the rigid row schema format that SQL so throughly assumes. For another, it has no concept of sharding, or indeed any other particular data-oriented structure of the database, which is simultaneously one of its strengths (it has survived precisely by not baking in such assumptions) but is also one of its weaknesses. If your database is sharded, for instance, there&#x27;s nothing particularly in SQL itself that will guide you towards understanding whether you&#x27;re writing a query that will or will not cross shards. You just have to &quot;know&quot;. In fact there&#x27;s a great deal of things about SQL performance that aren&#x27;t reflected in the language and you just have to &quot;know&quot;.<p>In theory, a new query language could potentially address these issues. In practice, what I&#x27;ve seen from &quot;new&quot; query languages has more to do with being &quot;easy to implement&quot; for the new store, and if that does or does not happen to meet any of these criteria, well wasn&#x27;t that a happy coincidence. Someday I hope to see a well-considered sequel to SQL (no pun intended), but the way of thought that SQL affords has so thoroughly taken over the world that it is hard to see past it, much as it is hard to see past the von Neumann computer architecture into anything else. (I am not one of those people who think either von Neumann architecture or SQL are terrible and it all went wrong because we got stuck on them, but that&#x27;s not to say they are the only way of doing business, either.)",1416447220

Toggle entire subtrees from view with a single key combination, or generate a sparse tree that only contains what you need.<p>Tables: Autoformatting ASCII tables that start on a new line with &quot;|&quot;. Mutate rows, columns, use emacs-calc inside of the table.<p>Todo Items: Create todo&#x27;s by writing a headline that contains &quot;TODO&quot; as in &quot;</i> TODO sth&quot;. Or pressing C-c C-t. Define different sets of todo states globally of per file. (Say BUG | RESOLVED WONTFIX) with any number of intermediate steps or finished states. Create TODO dependencies (just have sub-TODOs under existing TODOs). Add automatic notes to todo states, and or timestamps. Track how much time you&#x27;ve spent on TODOs exactly (say for billing).<p>Refile entire regions into different files entirely. Say you had your &quot;in&quot;-file, and you&#x27;re in your project view. You suddenly remember to go pick up milk. Type it into your project view, C-c C-w, autocomplete to your &quot;in&quot; file, refiled.<p>Agendas : Agendas will cull TODOs, Deadlines, Scheduled tasks and Habits from all your buffers automatically. Want to know what needs to get done at work today? Generate an agenda of all TODOs, Deadlines and Scheduled tasks that have the tag :Work:. Done.<p>The beauty of it is that you don&#x27;t have to learn how to do all of that right away. If you know the basic commands you can already get a lot of use out of it, hell, if you know the syntax for TODOs and headlines it&#x27;s allready usable. But org-mode is there for people who like to tweak their workflow. Everything is tweakable, rebindable, extendable, and it&#x27;s not limited to usage as a personal planning tool. You can write HTML with it, or insert LaTeX and export to PDF. A lot of those long guides for org-mode have been written in org-mode.<p>Edit: Now Hackernews formatting is messing with this a little, and thinks double stars mean indentation...now way to escape that though.",1416446296

Suddenly you have dozens of forks.  Now imagine that the core team eventually gets around to publishing that bugfix you really do want.  All of these incompatible forks need to down-integrate the change and work around the little tweaks they&#x27;ve added.  You have a mess.<p>Open source works because the projects that become popular can stake out a particular territory and say &quot;This is our responsibility, this is your responsibility, these are the hooks you can tap into, and if you don&#x27;t like it, fork or use a different project.&quot;  Flip the perspective and imagine yourself as the <i>user</i> of an open-source project.  There&#x27;s always a huge amount of work you have to do to customize exactly what the framework gives you to what the product needs.  This is okay, because that&#x27;s the bargain you know you&#x27;re signing up for when you use the open-source framework, and it is after all what you&#x27;re getting paid to do.  If you don&#x27;t believe it saves you more effort than it costs you, then don&#x27;t use it.  (In fact, there&#x27;s a huge graveyard of projects on GitHub where the author tosses their personal way of doing things over the wall and then wonders why nobody uses it or contributes to it.  This is why: the benefits don&#x27;t outweigh the costs.)<p>Now imagine that you&#x27;re at a big corporation.  There is a lot of work that <i>somebody</i> has to do to make the product work right.  All of you are getting paid by the same entity, the company.  Who does the work?  The team who wants it?  The team whose codebase it&#x27;s in?<p>Open source projects have the luxury of defined interfaces; they get to set the boundaries of what their code does themselves, and can turn away customers who need more than they provide.  Internal teams do not: if they say no to a critical feature (regardless of how different it is from their existing interface), the product doesn&#x27;t ship, and then an executive gets mad.  So often adding features is non-negotiable, the features are significant enough that there&#x27;s a real risk of impacting the stability or performance of the core product - <i>and yet it&#x27;s still the right thing for the business to do</i>.  The big problem is that each individual team wants clean code and well-defined interfaces, yet the benefit accrues to the company as a whole...hence, resentment between teams about who&#x27;s got to spend significant work mucking up their pristine design.",1416446099

You can get the text from the RSS feed [1].<p>---<p>Yesterday evening Pacific Standard Time, Azure storage services experienced a service interruption across the United States, Europe and parts of Asia, which impacted multiple cloud services in these regions.  I want to first sincerely apologize for the disruption this has caused.  We know our customers put their trust in us and we take that very seriously.  I want to provide some background on the issue that has occurred.<p>As part of a performance update to Azure Storage, an issue was discovered that resulted in reduced capacity across services utilizing Azure Storage, including Virtual Machines, Visual Studio Online, Websites, Search and other Microsoft services. Prior to applying the performance update, it had been tested over several weeks in a subset of our customer-facing storage service for Azure Tables. We typically call this “flighting,” as we work to identify issues before we broadly deploy any updates. The flighting test demonstrated a notable performance improvement and we proceeded to deploy the update across the storage service. During the rollout we discovered an issue that resulted in storage blob front ends going into an infinite loop, which had gone undetected during flighting. The net result was an inability for the front ends to take on further traffic, which in turn caused other services built on top to experience issues.<p>Once we detected this issue, the change was rolled back promptly, but a restart of the storage front ends was required in order to fully undo the update. Once the mitigation steps were deployed, most of our customers started seeing the availability improvement across the affected regions. While services are generally back online, a limited subset of customers are still experiencing intermittent issues, and our engineering and support teams are actively engaged to help customers through this time.<p>When we have an incident like this, our main focus is rapid time to recovery for our customers, but we also work to closely examine what went wrong and ensure it never happens again.

Sounds rather inefficient, right?<p>These bdelloids, on the other hand, just decided to shuffle the bits in place. A bit insecure (prone to errors and contamination), but very efficient in highly constrained (frequently dehydrated) environments.",1416445490

Well, duh.<p>OTOH, databases are only one component of modern architectures, which the article correctly asserts are largely limited in terms of scalability by throughput and latency. However, scalability is often secondary to functionality. And in terms of functionality, the long list of database types trawled out through the article only serve to highlight the real chokepoint:  cognitive overhead.<p>Perhaps what we really need are tools that enable us to more easily stop and think about the problem. Ideally, tools to test, profile, compare and switch between storage or other subsystem architectures without having to delve in to infinitesimal intracacies of each.<p><i>Success really depends on the conception of the problem, the design of the system, not in the details of how it&#x27;s coded.</i> - Leslie Lamport",1416445473

And while he doesn&#x27;t come right out and say it, I think he would agree that in hindsight his approach was absurd.  The whole second half of the post is about how actual programmers get actual work done, and it&#x27;s nothing like the first half.<p>The interesting question is why did he think his original approach was reasonable?  Did he not talk to an actual software engineer before embarking on his journey?  Sure something like his original path can be successful for some people, but it that a reasonable expectation?",1416445432

I would love to be able to build a whole database machinery out of specific primitives.<p>For example, a &quot;column&quot; is basically a primitive you should be able to instantiate using some kind of storage strategy: keep it in RAM, keep it partitioned into chunks, append-only, compressed, sorted, remote etc.<p>The main thing that I want is to separate data from queries. It&#x27;s always baffled me that traditional RDBMSes choose to commingle tables and indexes. Why does my commit have to wait for the indexes to catch up? Why do indexes have to be involved in the slow, complicated system of updating tuples that involve transactions, locking, paging and so on?<p>A better approach is to separate the two entirely:<p>1. The careful, slower ACID core that journals, fsyncs, keeps my data safe and provides a rigorous data model.<p>2. The super fast read-only, distributed indexes that organize the data in the most efficient way for querying (mostly through RAM and vectorization).<p>Now, I don&#x27;t really need my write node to be a super-complicated distributed, replicated, gossip-based hash-ring-sharded, quorum-coordinated eventual consistency monstrosity. Single master is fine as long as you can keep standby replicas that are easy to fail over to.<p>What I want is for there to be a whole gaggle of read-only slave indexes that get my data reasonably quickly and are super fast to query. Indexes can be eventually consistent; but they don&#x27;t need to be safe. Indexes can be reconstructed from the master data, after all. All we need to do is for indexes to ingest a continuous stream of data changes from the master.<p>Again, the master can be a bit slow: As slow as Postgres, at least. But the indexes, since they don&#x27;t need to deal with transactions or locking or anything of the sort, can be really fast. Splitting the two up means they can each worry about different things, and apply different tolerances and constraints to what they do.<p>Today, we accomplish something similar by using ElasticSearch with Postgres. It&#x27;s not good enough in the long run; they have completely different query mechanisms and data models, for one. It&#x27;s also difficult to keep ES in perfect sync, and ES is generally heavy-weight; ES indexes are beasts, not very mobile. For example, the schema is mostly static, and changes require cloning the index (which I find weird). Still too fulltext-oriented; it&#x27;s just not quite as good at non-text stuff. GIS support is lacking. And so on. A uniform query/database system is definitely needed.",1416445389

I&#x27;m hoping FreeCAD takes off eventually in this space (hobbyist parts design).<p>Of possible interest to those reading this, I worked on a project in college that did a similar thing with AutoCAD for full-size water treatment plants. A web interface[1] accepts input which is sent to design scripts, where equations of fluid dynamics and other physical constraints are used to scale components appropriately for the size requested. From there, the AutoCAD command prompt is accessed to generate a 3D model and various construction-oriented section views.<p>[1] <a href=""http://aguaclara.cornell.edu/implementation/design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aguaclara.cornell.edu/implementation/design/</a>",1416445205

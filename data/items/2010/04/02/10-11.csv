I actually think they're mostly doing a good job, given most project sponsor's initial thoughts around gaining users are to try and spam all existing users as much as possible, and then try and import all their contacts. There was quite a bit of this in the early fb days, but not so much now. This is a good thing.<p>Now, how to write an effective dating app?\nHow to get women using a dating app. These are the real challenges.\nP.o.F. is an ok site that I've used in the past, but always felt it could be better. Though I guess if you've got a steady income stream, you're more worried about breaking it, and loosing an income, than innovating. Have you thought of doing a sister site or two?",1270205763

It may be overly casual, familiar, or informal, but that's only bad manners in a setting that requires formality or involves people with whom you aren't familiar.<p>Manners are relative, anyway.  Some people think it's bad manners to put your elbows on the dining table.  Others couldn't care less.",1270204294

1236260,comment,1236048,1236048,0,0,AndrewDucker,,,"An odd article.  He seems to think there ought to be a Grand Plan forcing the transition.<p>Servers can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, there's no need for everyone to just switch over at once.<p>I strongly suspect that the big providers will start rolling it out over the next couple of years, and that this will filter down to local users after that.<p>My main problem is that very few home routers support IPv6, so they'll need to be replaced.  But this can happen over time, with people on IPv4 being behind NAT, and thus having less accessibility to soem applications, they can make their own choices about when to upgrade.",1270203868

Sometimes I dream about founding a dog free city.<p>It's not the dogs fault, but I simply like my surroundings shit free. Unfortunately, I can't think of any way for that problem to go away.

1236248,comment,1236214,1236214,0,0,ximeng,,,"Summary:<p>UI researchers can't easily add new features designed to make software easy to use to existing software. This is a particular problem with closed source software. ""Prefab"" is a tool that looks at the pixels on the display and infers what the underlying UI widgets are. Once this is done, additional features can be retrospectively added. This functionality is platform independent, and is demonstrated to run on YouTube videos (Flash), Mac, and PC.<p>Examples of functionality that can be added:<p>""Bubble cursor"" - highlighting of the nearest UI element to the cursor as if the hit area of the cursor dynamically increased to the nearest element.<p>Dynamic mouse acceleration change when cursor on a UI element<p>Animation to indicate state changes in UI elements such as tabs, sliders and checkboxes<p>Generation of a preview of a multi-parameter space in graphics tools such as GIMP or Photoshop. This works by automatically changing several sliders to affect parameters in a graphics transform and recording the preview image. The results are then dynamically displayed allowing users to view the effects of parameter changes in parallel using a grid of output images.",1270202949

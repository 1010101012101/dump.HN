If you click on delete the messages will only be invisible to you. US law enforcement agencies can access this information at there own liking, without judicial review.""</i><p>That last one is scary indeed. People were arguing a while ago whether these companies should keep data only for 6 months, or for a year, or 18 months - but Facebook is simply keeping it forever. Even 10 years from now law enforcement could verify your Facebook data.<p>Facebook Timeline should give them a nice UI, too, in case you don't delete anything. But they would still want to dig deep. I wonder if Facebook built a special Timeline product for law enforcement to see <i>everything</i> about everyone. Remember when they admitted a while ago that they provide law enforcement a special software for the data? I wonder if the idea of Timeline for users comes from that.<p>Julian Assange was dead-on that Facebook is the biggest spying machine.",1316987963

I only created an account of my own 9-ish months ago (before I started at Facebook), although I'm a long-time reader.

To us, the Hi-Tec-C cartridges deserve a more durable home.</i><p>This is kind of funny, I sort of did the same thing -- though my solution was much cheaper. I write a ton with ink and I had a hell of a time finding a pen that wrote smoothly, was gel, was rectractible (pen tops are a PITA), didn't smear, gave consistent lines, and was available at office stores for an affordable price. Well, the Pentel Energel pens met these requirements but the pen casing is flimsy and fat and very cheap feeling. So I just buy the refills and put them in a Sarasa SE pen casing. My only gripe is I would prefer a finer point. The Pentels only go to 0.7mm and I'd like at least 0.5mm, but this is good enough. Every gel pen I've used that size has problems (scratchy, suffers roller ball blowouts, etc.) so maybe good gel roller balls at that size present engineering problems.<p>Oh, and I also tried that Mont Blanc ""hack"" where you modify the refill cartridge so it fits in a cheapo Pilot G2 casing. I'm not willing to regularly pay $10-$15 for 2 ink refills, I just wanted to see what the fuss was all about. The writing was mediocre at best. Most noticeable was the problems I had with skipping and inconsistency. The value of Mont Blanc pens certainly does not come from the ink cartridges.",1316987073

I put some strikethrough in the original post. Now, let's get back to the points that aren't so ad hominem.<p>===================<p>1)devil's bargain - the person offers his or her soul in exchange for diabolical favors - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil</a><p>As a Facebook employee, you might not like the analogy, but it's a good metaphor. I really want what FourSquare has to offer - I want to connect with all my Facebook friends. However, the catch is that I can literally ONLY get this by allowing them to post to my wall. How is that not a good parallel to a devil's bargin?<p>2) ""preys on our children"" - As I understand it, minors can use Facebook. Minors then get tricked into allowing wall posts in order to get gems and little nothings in games. That's preying on children, much the same way Angry Birds and the social iPad games prey on children with the Mighty Eagle and what not.<p>3. covert influence by engineers - I just don't believe the sudden rush of Facebook engineers to comment on Hacker News didn't start with some conversations in Facebook. I don't really have any proof for this, except I've never heard from any of you on this forum until recently, and then several people all at once.<p>Also, typically commenters who have affiliations will call them out in their comment - it's nice that you and these other guys list yourselves as Facebook employees in your profiles, but not doing the disclosure explicitly seems to smack of the same attitude that makes the Facebook platform so insidious.<p>I think the article's point is fair - that the Facebook platform basically mandates developers ask people for all sorts of permissions when they want to do just once thing. And I don't blame FourSquare.<p>As for the rhetoric, I regret it - not because I think it's unfair, but because it didn't get the article the attention I think it deserves, so I failed.",1316985857

I don't know if this was because they wanted to leave themselves open to add extra features, or if there were obscure features that posted as you, but everything from bumper sticker apps to WSJ apps had the permission to post as you. In very close to none of these apps did they actually post without you taking a specific action and answering a prompt saying that yes, you really do want a post. I absolutely do not want any app to be able to post as me under any circumstance, and I have apparently had dozens of apps with this permission so far without me even realizing.<p>Because there is (apparently) no permission ""allow them to post after prompting me"", ""allow this app to post as me"" is the defacto choice for the former. If I authorized netflix to post as me in 2007, and it 4 years pass without it posting as me, then it suddenly starts posting as me in 2011 without me taking any additional action that is a serious problem, and that is the situation as I understand it right now.",1316984892

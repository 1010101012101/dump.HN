Parted still resizes partitions, after all...<p>I think the blame is more to be laid upon GParted than Parted; Parted seems to be going about their business normally, and GParted is apparently sticking to a philosophy of strict adherence to libparted without any additional dependencies?",1312815543

What you want to do is spend half your free time learning new (web) technologies AND the other half formulating ""dreams.""<p>You're in school so you can afford to dream bigger and thrive to solve bigger problems.  Learn to be a great person, not a mediocre developer.  Learn how to think and everything else will follow.<p>If you want to run your own startup some day, then you should start today.  Find a problem that interests you now and look for ways to solve it in your own way.  Domain names are cheap, hosting is also cheap, work on a project for yourself.<p>Also, try to refine your development process, php is fine, but you must combine it with patterns such as MVC.  Build a cheap computer and create your own development server.  Learn Python/Django or Ruby/RoR and more (NodeJS etc.).  Host your own version control system (Git, Hg etc.).<p>Young one, you need to learn to be a hardcore dreamer and level up like mad.<p>I've been doing web for 10 years and every time I look back, I always think that I learned more this year than many years before combined.  Every project I worked on, I always think that I've learned more from it than many before combined.  I am 28 now, but I am forever searching and learning.<p>Good luck and always, stay a hard core learner!",1312814646

Last weekend, we participated in Leedshack[2], and we build Barebones, which is a really simple wireframing tool for the iPad.<p>We spend a lot of time in meetings sketching in our notebooks, and often these sketches are a valuable artefact long before 'traditional' wireframing even enters the process; we wanted to replicated the speed and simplicity of 'back of a napkin' sketching, and combine it with really simple sharing (anything is better than taking a photo of a sketch with my iPhone and emailing it to a client!)<p>It's a HTML5 app, which uses <canvas> and the Dollar Gesture library to recognise shapes drawn on the screen and snap them to a 960 grid.<p>Our intention was for it to be so quick and simple to use that is can take the place of a quick pencil sketch in front of a client. It really is very simple to use, and we limited the gestures to just three very distinct movements, and with a little practise, it's actually very quick and accurate.<p>As I mentioned in the title, we built this in 24 hours, so it lacks quite a bit in polish, however all the guys on the team would love any feedback from fellow HNers.<p>[1] http://www.testled.com/\n[2] http://www.leedshack.com<p>Edit: A lot of people will be reading HN in a browser; Barebones does work in any reasonably modern browser, and it works with mouse events, but it really doesn't feel 'right'.

A willingness to destroy your attractive but unusable mock is what separates the graphic designers from the interface designers.<p>That said.... A/B testing can be <i>extremely dangerous</i>:<p>- It's VERY EASY to design your test incorrectly. The most common result is that your test really ends up measuring some other factor of the design, or is chock-full of confounding factors. Any conclusions you draw from it will almost certainly be incorrect.<p>- It's EVEN EASIER to over-generalize from your data. People clicked on the green button more than the red button...people must like green buttons! Quick, redo the design with a green palette! These conclusions are always terribly tempting to make, since it feels like you've uncovered some deep truth about your users. You probably haven't, and it probably can't be generalized beyond <i>the exact thing that you tested</i>.<p>- It's easy to substitute A/B testing for critical thinking and self-editing. Two options? Don't worry about deciding! A/B test them! Another decision needs to be made? We'll let the users decide! The problem here is twofold: a). When designing something interactive, there are simply too many decisions to be made. You better get comfortable with making them, because there isn't enough time in the world to A/B test them all. b). (related to below) Your product will end up looking like it was designed-by-committee. Which it was.<p>- Related to the previous one, you can get trapped into doing ""design by A/B testing"". It's a simple algorithm. Get something that looks okay, then do an A/B test on some small changes. Pick the best one. Repeat. Unfortunately, the nature of A/B testing is that it is inherently <i>isolated</i>. If you're testing correctly, you've eliminated all your confounding factors. You're just looking at <i>one</i> aspect of your system. The problem is that interfaces are inherently tightly coupled. Everything tends to depend on everything else, and then you start throwing in abstract concepts like ""feel"" and ""friction"" and general ""look"" of the site (how well does it fit together? does it seem to have personality? Does it respect the metaphors it creates? Is it consistent?). A/B testing can't measure that kind of stuff. You also get into problems of local maxima. This is essentially a hill-climbing algorithm. Unless you're willing to occasionally start descending a hill, you're going to get stuck in an okay-but-could-be-better hump forever.<p>In short: A/B testing is powerful. Don't abuse it. And for godsakes, design your damn tests correctly.",1312814483

Reading this I cant help but think how this person falls into the java trap of trying to make a ridiculously generic solution which I would consider a danger sign but plenty of people love to see.<p>So, assuming a real world input and real world dictionary you can try plenty of things that break down for a dictionary that includes four hundred As but are actually valid solutions. Also, if you want a fast real world solution then sticking with a pure lookup dictionary would slow things down.  Being able to toss 5 letters into a lookup table that says the longest and shortest words that start with those letters would save a lot of time.  Basically, xxyzy = null, null saves you from looking up x to the maximum word length in your dictionary.  Secondly sanitizing inputs is going to be both safer and faster.  And anything you are coding in 45 minutes is going to be a long way from production ready code.<p>PS: Even with backtracking you can code an O(n) solution for vary large input sets.

In other words, it's not the questions that are the problem, it's what you do with the answers.<p>HN is (at this time) programmer-centric. It ought to be obvious that you cannot design the best program on a large scale by optimizing functions. You have to start with a good design and then relentlessly optimize the bits. From time to time you have to consider larger redesigns that would throw all your previous optimizations right out.<p>Web/UX design is roughly analogous. Customer conversion, for example, is a minefield. You might have two archetypical personae, Alice and Bob. If you start with a design that appeals to the Bobs and the Alices equally, a small change (sexist image?) might alienate the Alices but increase the appeal to the Bobs. If the <i>immediate</i> gain outweighs the loss, it looks good.<p>But further gains run out of steam when you have all the Bobs but no Alices: You have reached a local maxima as you state so economically. Had you tried a different optimization that marginally increased appeal to both the Alices and the Bobs, you might be able to continue to acquire both the Alices and the Bobs over time, far outstripping the Bob-centric improvements that alienate Alice.<p>But you'll never know if you went with the biggest immediate gain.",1312812591

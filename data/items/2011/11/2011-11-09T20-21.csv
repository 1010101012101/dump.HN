3217333,comment,3214527,3214527,5,0,stevep98,,,"A customer once reported a problem with a product I worked on. The issue involved a user interface intended to show a list of users which were fetched from the database. They said that the software took about an hour to display all the users. The expectation was that it would be pretty much instant.<p>In our testing, we had only tested to 100 users, but when we tried 4000, we couldn't reproduce the problem. It took 5 seconds to show the data, not an hour.<p>It took a long time to track this down. It turned out that the results from the database were in sorted order, and then the UI sorts them for display with quicksort. A list in pre-sorted order is the worst case (n^2) for quicksort.<p>(As an aside, the results were in sorted order, even though the query did not specify that they should be sorted. The reason for this was that this table was loaded into the database from some other source, and that other source outputted the data in sorted order...  So, it wasn't just a case of removing a 'ORDER BY' from the query)<p>After thinking about this a bit, I decided to randomize the data after it was fetched, and this brought the time required back down into the sub-10-second range. The problem with sort algorithms is that the worst cases are sometimes fatal to your application, and aren't as rare as you might think. Having an algorithm like timsort that is tuned for these not-so-rare cases sounds quite useful.",1320871873

I'm no database expert but I know how to build a query, normalisation, relational integrity and all that. Enough to identify bad SQL in a CRUD application. And I'll take the time to learn more about it and how to better construct a schema and query (and whether or not an RDBMS is even appropriate for the application).<p>With this in mind my boss mentioned one of our sites was ""dying on its arse."" It was hammering the slow query log, pages could take 10, maybe 20 seconds to load.<p>Turned out there were NO indexes at all. Maybe the odd primary key from the default CMS install (which was by no means database efficient). So we sorted that and that sorted out the immediate speed issues.<p>Of course, it went without saying that a poorly constructed schema must be related to a poorly constructed query or two. We were actually wrong. It was more like a query or <i>twenty</i>.<p>The submission of one form was done <i>field by field</i>. There was an UPDATE query constructed for each field and processed there and then, on a form with at least 12 fields. There was a comment above, ""We have to do it this way. Trust me."" As far as I could tell they didn't know how to dynamically build a query.<p>Further along, different update queries were performed by first deleting the record, and then re-inserting it with one of the fields updated.<p>I never quite got as far as that. There was no comment anywhere about the reasoning for such a strange approach.<p>I think some developers don't bother figuring it out because they think there are better things to do than optimise your code.",1320870219

Aside from the feature not even existing yet, that would mean the author would need to both want to and be able to go back through the revision history and describe what they were thinking at the time.

I did. What I found was a rigorous system of monitoring. Once a firm has been well established and proven to be providing the proper care to their employees, providing safety equipment for example, I think they only send a person to inspect every 3 years - but, like I said that's after a long history of passing the rigorous testing.<p>Never any abuse? Doubtful, there's abuse in countries with strict labour laws that obviates (or should) the need for fair trade certification.<p>So then we come back to my metaphor (you understand the term and function presumably, even though you used it as a direct statement). I don't see why buying a chocolate bar should have me being part of a supply chain that includes child/slave/below poverty labour and abuse of the workforce (like spraying crops with pesticides when workers are working on them). Nor do I feel that we're in such a state of poverty as a species that we need people to be worked hard without access to sufficient funds to cover basic health and education needs.<p>So, you feel Fairtrade fails? That we shouldn't support people working out of poverty by preventing multinationals working for us from offering below subsistence prices for crops? That we should exclude people from getting educated and staying healthy in the name of greater profits for wealthy capitalists?<p>You <i>appear</i> to be worked up about my metaphor being imperfect; I couldn't care less about the metaphor.

Your only risk is not getting a reward.<p>The problem is that is the nature of bonuses. Succeed and get a bonus. To mitigate the risks we need a system where instead of bailing out, we let the companies fail. Banks should close. People should lose money. People should be cautious of investing on shaky grounds.<p>The only need is credit unions and financial institutions who are FORBIDDEN from behaving in certain risky ways. People will store their money in these banks/unions which are ""stable"" so nobody loses their savings. If you invest, you invest, and all is well because you knew the risk, or should have known.

3217137,comment,3216896,3216896,1,0,kstenerud,,,"Using isolated, raw time numbers is meaningless when talking about performance. What you should be talking about is how much time is spent in code RELATIVE to all other code in the critical path. This talk of nanoseconds and how they don't matter over X operations is terribly irresponsible and deceptive.<p>What we see from the performance tests at the end of the article is that running an empty code block with exception setup/teardown takes twice as long as it would without exceptions. That's bad if this code turns out to be the bottleneck, since you could effectively halve the bottleneck cost by taking exceptions out.<p>But even then, this is a flawed experiment, because you need to factor in the cost of what you're actually DOING inside of the exception handler (after all, nobody runs an exception handler with nothing in it!). If the exception setup/teardown code only accounts for 1% of the total execution time within it, removing exceptions isn't going to help your performance at all.<p>Not only that, but you really need to be checking times when exceptions ARE triggered, as well as not. In short, performance testing needs to be done in an environment as close to the real runtime environment as possible, with conditions as similar as possible. Otherwise you could very well be wasting your time.<p>So are exceptions expensive? Based on the author's own calculations, they can be if you have very little code within your exception handler. And if the exception can be expected to trigger with sufficient frequency, the exception catching code needs to be taken into account as well. So no, the myth is NOT busted, because the fact remains that exceptions can have a very real cost, depending on your usage (and platform!).<p>As well, the rant on code style at the top of the article is flawed:<p>""Why is this for(;;) idiom so popular?  Not because it makes sense as a syntactic structure.""<p>It's popular because it has been used for so long that it has become an accepted idiom in C (and other C-like languages). It makes no difference how it originated. I've never met anyone who actually believed that for(;;) is faster or slower than while(true).<p>Same goes for embedding assignments within if statements, the author's personal views on code aesthetics notwithstanding.",1320868953

The basic data is supposedly taken from five official reports, but only one of these (the one they call ""DOL"" [2]) has anything direct to do with production of goods by forced labor.<p>Examining this report, it provides nothing more than a list of countries and goods for which forced labor plays a ""significant"" part, where significant is defined as anything but ""an isolated incident of child labor or forced labor"" ([2] p.7).

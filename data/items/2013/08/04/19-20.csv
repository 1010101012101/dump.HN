Other than that, I have some qualms with the post. For a start, it doesn&#x27;t consider that compilation takes time. The great thing about JIT compilation is you know everything about the code being run. The bad thing is you have no time to make use of  this information.<p>Then there is this:<p><i>Traditionally, static typing was the best way to guarantee we produced good CPU instructions. It gave us a clear picture of the world we could ponder and meditate over, eventually boiling out the secrets of the universe and producing the fastest possible code.</i><p>Huh, what? Any compiler author knows that many compiler optimization problems are NP-Complete. For example, graph colouring register allocation is, as the name suggests, NP-complete. You have to do register allocation whether you JIT compile or AOT compile, and you have to do it approximately in both cases. (IIRC typical JIT compilers use a linear scan graph allocation algorithm which is almost as good as graph colouring but much faster.)<p>Furthermore, in the languages he considers there are loads of optimization opportunities that cannot be statically expressed in the language (e.g. stack allocation of memory, immutability, SIMD operations). You can infer many of these statically, but statically typed languages also benefit from JIT optimization using extra information available at runtime in the same way that dynamically typed languages do.<p>Finally, a type theorist would have a fit over how he uses the word &quot;typed&quot; (and they would object to this comment as well.) Types don&#x27;t exist a runtime -- representations do.<p><i>Update</i> AOT compilers also allow code to be targeted to specific machines. An obvious example is a Linux distro available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. GCC allows much finer distinctions than this.<p>AOT compilers can also make use of runtime information -- so-called &quot;profile guided optimisation.&quot;",1375645836

After visiting a screen, that particular segment would become visible on your map.<p>I prefer this analogy because it encourages looking at the entire map (3rd person) instead of thinking only of your current position in the &quot;maze/level&quot; (1st person).<p>Chris naturally made this abstraction when considering how to &quot;map out the idea maze&quot;, but I think it&#x27;s an important distinction.<p>I think the most efficient manner of elucidating squares on your map is by engaging customers.  Engaging them with a prototype is a phenomenal exercise, but requires more time and resources then just engaging them with a questionnaire over coffee or via an online survey.

But I have dealt with pupils who have severely broken concepts of decimal place, and whose potential for understanding basic arithmetic has been damaged beyond repair.[0]<p>I believe the KA is doing brilliant things, and opening up knowledge for all is fantastic.  I would just like to be convinced that modern research about pedagogy is being integrated rather than ignored.  The evidence suggests it isn&#x27;t, and I very much look forward to the day when it is, so this resource becomes even better.<p>And lest you think that I am one of the ones feeling threatened, I&#x27;m not.  I&#x27;m not a teacher, but I do go out and give presentations for the purpose of enrichment and enhancement.  As such I am often asked to consult on questions of tutoring both the most able and the least able, and because of that I work closely with those active in pedagogy research.<p>[0] I can&#x27;t, of course, say that the damage was irreparable, but despite many hours of effort, I and several colleagues found no way to dissuade the student that 0.35 was bigger than 0.4, no matter what we tried.",1375642939

Decrying the mistakes of the most free, most voter-responsive countries while becoming a fellow traveler with a variety of dictatorships is not what I expected of Wikileaks four years ago or so when a friend suggested that I &quot;like&quot; Wikileaks on Facebook. An Australian commentator<p><a href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/some-secrets-best-remain/story-e6frg6z6-1226680991786"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/some-secrets-b...</a><p>expresses in the commentator&#x27;s choice of words the thoughts I have about why you and I and the world are not gaining freedom through the actions of Wikileaks and its supporters recently. I respect anyone&#x27;s right to disagree with me (and would be happy to hear your reasons for your disagreement), but on my part I will be glad to see Wikileaks fizzle out as a movement and as an organization, despite my former support for Wikileaks.",1375642905

Frankly, I think there&#x27;s some value in having an actual peace prize, so I would rather see the former happen.",1375642859

Imagine you and your friends decide to order a pizza and agree to vote on the toppings. That&#x27;s fine. But it&#x27;s not fine for a friend to force you to pay for the pizza when you didn&#x27;t agree to do so.",1375642831

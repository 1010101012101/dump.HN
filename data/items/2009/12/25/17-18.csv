1015119,comment,1015054,1015054,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Here's my takeaway from this piece:<p>""Why didn't the Influentials wield more power? With 40 times the reach of a normal person, why couldn't they kick-start a trend every time? Watts believes this is because a trend's success depends not on the person who starts it, but on how susceptible the society is overall to the trend--not how persuasive the early adopter is, but whether everyone else is easily persuaded. And in fact, when Watts tweaked his model to increase everyone's odds of being infected, the number of trends skyrocketed.""<p>This sure seems to back up Adreessen's argument that market opportunity is the single most important factor in considering an opportunity.",1261762428

1015104,comment,1014500,1014960,0,0,neilk,,,"I've seen a mailing list discussion between female engineers on this topic.<p>One intriguing idea they put forward is that in developing countries, in the last few decades, kids did not have access to home computers or console devices. You only got significant amounts of time with a computer once you had reached university. So everybody in a CS program, male and female, was starting from zero, as near-adults.<p>So the Asian universities did not have any toxically geeky culture, and they also had to get really good at teaching complete newbies. In this atmosphere women did as well as men.<p>It was suggested that Western CS departments are dominated by people from the gamer scene, who are almost all male. They are very familiar with the technology already, and skew the academic culture in such a way that interested newcomers are less welcome, and less able to keep up.",1261760990

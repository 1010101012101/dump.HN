But there's a lesson there too: in the end, the answer to any trouble you might have is to simply find the craving and the aversion. Find the ignorance in your misery. You were safe and taken care of, and you felt you were at risk. You were wrong.<p>Blaise Pascal famously claimed that all of man's problems stems from the inability to sit quietly in a room, alone. And we are <i>not</i> able to do it, either. Vipassanna is the rather upsetting path toward learning to be able to sit quietly in a room, alone. And it's very simple, but not at all easy.",1358564305

5082434,comment,5078488,5081192,2,0,shiven,,,"HIV, being a retrovirus, acts by inserting its genome into the infected cell's nuclear DNA. The infected cell is unable to distinguish it from its own 'native' DNA. This is a fundamental aspect of how the cellular machinery is hijacked by the virus to replicate itself.<p>Now, nearly a tenth of the human genome is made up of retroviruses (ERVs) that got inserted into our genome over the course of our species' (rather short) evolutionary history [0]. These ERVs were rendered dormant by genomic silencing of entire swaths of the genome (by mechanisms too detailed to go into here) turning them into 'harmless', silent blocks of genetic code we now carry in every cell!<p><i>is it reasonable to assume that it would be possible to infect enough T-cells with the virus to overlap a significant portion of the HIV infected cells?</i><p>That is the basic assumption, but is not guaranteed to happen. Specifically because a sub-population of infected T-cells, called the 'reservoir' population, are 'sleeping' in the bone marrow or the brain (and numerous other organs), waiting for signals from the immune system to activate them into action, which may happen due to an unrelated infection (or other reasons). This sub-population of cells, once called into action, will start running their usual gene expression program, resulting in the production of new viruses and infection of new cells. This is the NP-hard problem of HIV therapies!<p><i>Or is the goal to try to introduce entire modified HIV genomes into cells and then have those be fortuitously replicated and bound into HIV particles which will hopefully go out and re-infect other T-cells and in the process inhibit the HIV production rate?</i><p>In a word, yes. But there are too many moving parts to have the whole shebang fly off the handle and cause unintended or unexpected actions. Gene therapy, in its current form, has its place in the pantheon of medicine, but HIV is probably not a very good problem to attack with this approach, partly for reasons I mentioned above. The future of gene therapy holds the definite promises of <i>miracle cures</i>, which will be possible after more research and development (but only made possible by your tax dollars) ...<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus</a>",1358564087

5082377,comment,5080210,5080210,0,0,Yttrill,,,"I'm afraid the argument that C+ASM is always faster is flawed in reality. Pure ASM, with a bit of C thrown in, maybe, but this is just as impractical for complex codes as C itself is.<p>It is well known that for numerical codes Fortran beats the pants off C. Why is this? Because the structure of C programs proves difficult to optimise automatically. Indeed the C committee attempted to address one of the main problems by introducing the restrict keyword (the problem of course is aliasing).<p>For complex codes, ASM isn't an option. For large functions, high levels of optimisation aren't an option for C because C compilers are incapable of optimisation in a reasonable time frame: I have short code that cannot be compiled in less than 2 minutes on either gcc or clang. Full alias analysis requires data flow which is cubic order on function size and C compilers are incapable of partitioning functions to keep the cost down.<p>Furthermore, C has an weak set of control operations and an object model which is generally inappropriate for modern software. K&R C compilers were hopeless because of the ABI required the caller push and pop arguments to support varargs, preventing tail rec optimisation of C function calls.<p>Subroutine calling is useful, but it is not the only control structure. Continuation passing, control exchange, and other fundamentals are missing from C. These things can always be emulated by turning your program into one large function, but then, it isn't C and it cannot be compiled because the best C compilers available cannot optimise large functions.<p>Similarly, complex data structures which involve general graph shapes require garbage collection for memory management. With C that's not built in so you have no choice but to roll your own (there is no other way to manage a graph). It's clear that modern copying collectors will beat the pants of C in this case.<p>C++ pushes the boundaries. It can trash C easily because it has more powerful constructions. It had real inlining before C, and whole program compilation via templates. It is high enough level for lazy evaluators to perform high level optimisations (expression templates) C programmers could never dream of. And C++ virtual dispatch is bound to be more effective than roll your own OO in C, once the program gets complex because the C programmer will never get it right: the type system is too weak.<p>Many other languages generate C and have an FFI, some, like Felix, go much further and allow embedding. Indeed, any C++ program you care to write is a Felix program by embedding, so Felix is necessarily faster than C by the OP's argument: C++ is Felix's assembler.<p>As the compiler writer I have to tell you that the restriction to the weak C/C++ object model is a serious constraint. I really wish I could generate machine code to get around the C language. Its slow. Its hard to express useful control structures in. It tends to generate bad code. With separate compilation bad performance is assured.<p>I am sorry but the OP is just plain wrong. C is not assured to be faster, on the contrary, its probably the worst language you could dream up in terms of performance. The evidence is in the C compilers themselves. They're usually written in C, and they're incapable of generating reasonable code in many cases and impossible to improve because C is such a poor language that all the brain power of hundreds of contributors cannot do it.<p>Compare with the Ocaml compiler, written in Ocaml, which is lightning fast and generates reasonable code, all the time: not as fast as C for micro-benchmarks but don't even think about solving complex graph problems in C, the Ocaml GC (written in C), will easily trash a home brew collection algorithm.<p>Compare with ATS(2) compiler, written in Ocaml(ATS), which by using dependent typing eliminates the need for run time checks that plague C programs given the great difficulty reasoning about the correctness of C codes. AST generates C, but you would never be able to hand write that same C and also be confident your code was correct.<p>Compare with Felix, compiler written in Ocaml, which generates C++, can do very high level optimisations, which can embed C++ in a more flexible way than a mere FFI, and which provides some novel control structures (fibres, generators) which you'd never get right hand coding in C.<p>The bottom line is that OP's claim is valid only in a limited context. C is good for small functions where correctness is relatively easy to verify manually and optimisation is easy to do automatically, and any decent C code generating compiler for a high level language will probably generate C code with comparable performance.<p>So the converse of the argument is true: good high level languages will trash C in all contexts other than micro tests where they will do roughly the same.",1358562670

However the major flaw is that businesses are not formal systems, nor are they run like software. If your business is a formal system of axioms and rules so well specified that operating it is akin to executing a software program, then this would apply to you. However, most businesses are stochastic processes, full of unexpected random behaviours and events operating in the universe that is decidedly not a formal system. What is more businesses are run by humans so even if every single thing every employee does every day were specified to the minute detail (like a computer program) there would still be lots of random mistakes in execution.<p>This is really the same reason why people who think that software development process/methodology is all they need to be successful.

We know pretty well how he did it - all he needed to do was stay within the limits and there is considerable evidence that the UCI and testing labs were suggesting to him how to do that. When the UCI picked a max hematocrit number of 50%, it was an invitation to the athletes to dope up to that limit. When he came back to competition in 2009 & 2010, the USADA report clearly states that his blood passport profile shows almost certain non-legal manipulation.<p>B. He isn't being forced to do anything. He had the opportunity to challenge USADA's report in arbitration; he declined and again denied he had ever doped. Going on TV to speak with a talk-show host after you have retired is not a coerced move, especially to say that you have been lying for 15 years. Yes, he may want to return to some kind of competition (triathlons) and needs his life sentenced to be reduced to the minimum 8 years to do this. But oh look, he says the last time he ever doped was 2005 (not when he raced in 2009 or 2010, how about that?), which would mean he could return to sport in 2013.<p>C. George Hincapie never tested positive either, had an even longer career than Armstrong and was a long-time friend of Armstrong. He admitted to doping for years and testified against Lance. There's a rather simple truth here and it isn't driven by doubt and jealousy.<p>D. I'm not even sure what you are trying to say. But I imagine it is similar to arguments made before about scored rivals and journalists seeking vengeance. I've followed pro cycling for many years now; the truth is much more boring. The sport was rife with drugs, Armstrong would do anything to win and I don't think to this day he thinks he did anything truly wrong.<p>I watched the movie ""Shattered Glass"" two nights ago.

We're going to have to go through all of them, now. \nCaitlin Avey: No, the only one was Hack Heaven. He told me that himself. \nChuck Lane: If he were a stranger to you, if he was a guy you were doing a piece about, pretend that guy told you he'd only did it once. Would you take his word for it? Of course not! You'd dig and you'd bury him! And you'd feel offended if anyone told you not to.",1358560804

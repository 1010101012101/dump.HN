For some of us WordPress is not reacting quickly enough to adopting the 21 century way of providing user experience. Obviously it's unrealistic for WordPress itself to drop everything and focus on this (that just isn't how life works), but it's certainly interesting and worthwhile to explore how modernisation of WordPress will enhance its original reason to exist. Looking at Ghost from this perspective and all the other reasons that John mentions in a comment below makes forking WordPress the right thing to do<p>This project doesn't need someone who loves WordPress and wants make more plugins for it. It needs someone who thinks they can make a good thing even better. Steve Jobs didn't just make a new cover for mobile phones. He fundamentally proved that communicational devices must become many times better than what they were before and that's what I expect from John.<p>Even Steve couldn't fix AT&T so don't expect John to fix WordPress core issues. That job is for WordPress itself.",1352177989

4747285,comment,4747212,4747212,1,0,byoung2,,,"I used to work at Internet Brands, and their business model involved buying and migrating sites to a common platformand monetizing them.  They were mostly interested in the traffic and the content, and much to the chagrin of developers like me, they didn't care what the code looked like.  We got handed sites in ASP classic, ColdFusion, Perl, and even 10,000 flat html files and were told to rewrite them.<p>Later, while working as a dev at ClearChannel, I was part of a team of 3 devs who converted RushLimbaugh.com from Communique (a self-contained Java CMS complete with its own database) to an MVC framework based on Zend.  They paid Rush $400 million, and I'd estimate that the site rewrite was probably a $30,000-$50,000 line item in that budget.<p>Don't bother fixing spaghetti PHP.

4747259,comment,4740540,4744880,3,0,JshWright,,,"It's not the CPR that's particularly damaging. Yes, ribs are dislocated (though rarely broken), and cartilage is torn. Those are fairly minor complications though. The 'damage' is done by the medications we push. Drugs like Epinephrine are very good at getting your heart to beat again. A recent study in Japan suggests that that may be at the expense of your brain, and other vital organs. Other drugs commonly used in ACLS resuscitation are equally nasty (Amiodarone, for instance).<p>You're absolutely right that we've gotten very good at getting a heart to beat for a few more days until it succumbs to the damage done to the rest of the body (that 40% figure you mention, though out-of-hospital rates are still much lower than that). The exciting research being done is to improve long term outcomes for cardiac arrest patients.<p>More and more research is showing that the key to a good long term outcome is early compressions, effective compressions (push hard and fast), uninterrupted compressions, and early defibrillation (with an AED or manual defibrillator). Over the past 10 years, resuscitation algorithms have been streamlined to minimize 'off chest' time. Compression to breath ratios have changed (from 5:1, to 15:2, to 30:2). A great deal of emphasis has been placed on keeping the rhythm checks that happen every two minutes as short as possible. We're now teaching people to continue compressions while the defibrillator is charging (and under ideal circumstances, you could easily continue compressions throughout the shock). Intubation is performed without stopping compressions.<p>The focus of all of these changes is to decrease the number of time compressions are stopped. Every time compressions are stopped, it takes some number of compressions to get the pressure built back up in your circulatory system. Fewer interruptions means fewer 'wasted' compressions, and less time that the brain isn't getting perfused. This is obviously key to a good neurological outcome.<p>We like to think all our fancy drugs and advanced interventions are doing something effective, but in reality, 'basic' treatments like CPR and defibrillation are what really save lives, and more importantly, save brain.",1352176305

This toolkit's sweet spot is PhoneGap & friends, clearly.<p>See, the need this fills (and apparently does a good job at) is to give front-end web devs resources to write UIs in PhoneGap that look just like Interface Builder apps. Why would you want to do this? Possibly because you don't have iOS coders. Or perhaps your coders are already familiar with the web, so why not re-use their skillz?<p>The assumption here is that a front-end web dev can get a native-looking iOS app together faster in PhoneGap than a native developer can get a real iOS app together. While that's not always going to be true, it is probably usually true. And for some apps (like, virtually anything that's just business-oriented and doesn't require crazy stuff), the difference will not be noticeable by end-users (although it might trigger an uncanny valley feeling).",1352176007

One of my tools offer is a profile harvesting and uploading system in the form of an executable that simply uploaded the Lua files generated by my WoW Profiling Mod (collecting things like character level, name, class, professions, skills, etc - nothing personal or potentially dangerous).  After getting a few customer emails about Sophos detecting it as a virus, I contacted Sophos to let them know about it.<p>After verifying that it did indeed not contain a virus, they decided to <i>still</i> flag it as a supposed ""PUA (Potentially Unwanted Software) or Adware"".  I protested, saying that no one would ever accidentally install this (it's not bundled with anything, it's a direct download), nor does it generate ads, nor does it do anything the user doesn't expect it to do, which is exclusively uploading character profile information to their website. In no way should be classified alongside Adware.<p>They responded with something of the order ""Sophos is for business computers, and because this is for games, it potentially unwanted on the business machine."" They refused to remove the flag.<p>So my Sophos users just have to accept that Sophos basically tells them that my app contains malware - since who's going to see ""PUA/Adware"" and think anything other than <i>""This is adware? Screw this, not worth it. BRB cancelling this scam of a service.""</i><p>So I have absolutely no sympathy for Sophos, and it's funny to me that a company supposedly dedicated to keeping malware and viruses off business computers is riddled with security vulnerabilities, and then tries to brush them under the table because they have not yet been detected to have been exploited.

This looks interesting to me, and it caught my eye when I saw it on Hacker News much in the same way Meteor did when it came out. For me personally, it just passed the initial smell test really well.<p>In terms of some concrete attributes which I like, I think it probably is the best framework I've seen in terms of the general aesthetic. I have high hopes that it will allow me to create most of the view elements I'd need to prototype in an incredibly short period of time. I haven't used jQuery mobile for some time now (> 1 year) yet it seems like there are more CSS classes in Ratchet that mimic the iOS look and feel well enough that one could develop a full iOS app prototype in a day or less. If I remember correctly from using jQuery mobile, there was a bit more code to write, and the general look just didn't feel as good to me.",1352175126

His company is already profitable, providing the livelihoods of > 10 US employees and several more overseas.<p>Right now, he's in the process of refactoring a bunch of code.  He's taking the current model, which is more or less procedural with a templating system, and moving it to a more MVC based design.<p>My question is, if he wants to sell the company at some point (software included, of course), will it be easier to sell if the software (which is based on PHP) is object-oriented?<p>I think it should be fine the way it is, except that some functions need to be split into smaller functions that separate into MVC (so some functions can be used throughout the site more readily), and are small enough for unit testing.  That would be the quickest easiest thing to do, but now is the time to rebuild based on an OO design if that will make the company worth more when it is time to sell it.<p>Anyone have any experience with this?",1352174882

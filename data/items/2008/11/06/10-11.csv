355559,comment,354802,354802,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"this is really depressing.  are all of you asleep at the wheel?  this essay is NOT ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING.  global warming is only the latest in a long line of scientific studies that have become corrupted due to the influence of politics.  The details of the current case are not important.  Whether or not anthropogenic global warming is true is not important.  What is important is the way scientists are behaving.  If scientists are reduced to squabbling children as soon as there is some blood in the water what hope does the rest of humanity have?<p>This essay is one of genuine concern over the direction of humanity.  And as the best hope we have for a rational future, concern over the direction of science.",1225968983

There are many reasons for having standard procedures to publish scientific work (theories.)<p>I love discussion, as long it isn't a time waster on basics. You don't peer review on BBC or MSM. It creates a false debate confusing people. And Daily Express is usually full of exaggerations and fallacies.<p>Also, I don't see very well the HN worthy angle. But that's just me.",1225968542

Moreover, this gourmet bread maker could actually be the same person as the shit sandwich maker, provided you stop supporting his failed business and force him to create something people really want.<p>If you want to have social policies, at least try to have sensible ones: protect individuals themselves (not their jobs).",1225968364

If I really have to, I can go in and remove the mapping. It's enough of a hassle that I don't though. It's worked so well that I ended up blocking sites that get me upset also (intranet).. that kills my productivity in a different way.<p>Also, as much as I thought I benefit from the internet while doing a lot of my work, I now really question it. In the past few years, when stuck on a problem, I'd just google it. Now, I think that's probably counterproductive in the long-run. It gets you out of what you were doing, and you don't learn as much or as deeply as working on the problem yourself.<p>Lately, I've been trying to figure out how to best deal with IM. I do need to have it up so people that are too far away to get to me can ask questions, but I like talking to people more than I like my work right now.

This question is distracting me from my work.. see what you have done :D<p>I agree with the others: find ways to enjoy what you do hr by hr.<p>Part of my day job involves analysing up to 1,000,000 images at a time and categorising them (that many images takes around 3hrs with our software). That gets VERY boring: what I do is set myself targbets - so I say ""at 40,000 I will read my mail"". Only when I get there I say - oh just another 5,0000. I developed a very usfel OCD-like thing of not beign able to stop until the ""done"" number reaches a precisely round number (which nevert happens :D) like 10,000 etc. :)<p>Try something similar: set short targets after which you will break - but then extend them. Set targets and what time you hope to reach them by; but make sure you will easily make it in the time you set. Then say ""oh well in the time I have left I could do... xyz"".<p>Keep setting tiny targets till you can't face it anymore and then lose yourself in the net for a bit :) (until you realise you should be back at work).<p>I have found that forcing work in this way for 2hrs then breakign for 20mins gets a lot more work done :D",1225966967

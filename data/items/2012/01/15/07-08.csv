3466674,comment,3466096,3466096,3,0,pilif,,,"The fundamental problem here is that libcrystalball doesn't exist yet: sometimes you want mute to mute the alarms (in concerts, though why would you need an alarm there) and sometimes you need mute to not affect alarms (when getting up).<p>As far as I can see, there's no way to reliably detect the situation at alarm time. Less and less as the time between setting mute and the alarm getting off increases.<p>Warning the user when turning on mute doesn't help either because for one the mute switch on the iPhone can be operated blindly because the phone wibrates when you mute it, so usually you'd not look at the phone to mute it.<p>And even if you did check its display and it did show that warning: the warning is totally useless for you most of the time (i.e before going to sleep), so that you will quickly be conditioned to ignore it - just like the security warnings in current OSes.<p>Or you are like me and have your phone muted for the majority of the time. Showing me that warning two weeks before the concert wouldn't help at all.<p>No. I believe that the current design which optimizes for the common case (not sleeping through the alarm) is fine. Just be mindful of this feature and check the alarms before the concert starts, or if you can at all afford it, just turn off the phone completely.<p>The hurdle of turning it off is as big as the hurdle of remembering to correctly set a three-state mute feature, but the current two-state one with haptic feedback has the huge advantage of simplicity.",1326614115

I could never remember all the 3 digit channel numbers before.<p>I watch more YouTube because the app is so easy to use, it's got a little button that tells it to only show me HD videos in the results, videos almost never buffer unlike on a PC, and I can't tell the difference between a 1080p YouTube video and live HD TV.<p>It makes any TV I plug into it an Android device. Android Market and all. I use a couple apps regularly.<p>It eliminates 3 remote controls.

He's not infallible though and I'm glad someone had the balls not just to put their disagreement in writing but to post it here on HN too. The author makes some good points and if the Schlep Blindness essay was written by anyone else there wouldn't be such a knee-jerk reaction to come to his defense like there is here. This community pays a lot of lip service to being the best, the brightest, critical and independent thinkers but then we all end up looking like hypocrites in situations just like this one. While there's no doubt that PG is am exceptional person I really think his celebrity and a ton of groupthink influences our interpretation of what PG says and how we react when someone doesn't fall in line to compliment him or do anything but disagree with what he says. I also shouldn't have to litter my opinion here with qualifications about how I think PG is great but without doing so I'll probably get bullied into submission via downvotes and various snarky comments. When the author of this article pointed out that the PG essay was basically telling us what we already knew while tricking us into thinking it were so profound the lightbulb went off in my head that inspired this. Anyway, we should all take what PG says like something any mere mortal would come up with. Some of its good, some not as good.

""Harm"" is a relative notion.  The baseline state against which the situation is be measured is that all information by default should be in the public domain.  The gains that authors get from copyrights are a <i>grant</i>, not an entitlement, to encourage them to produce.  So the ""harm"" is that the grant is (perhaps) smaller than it would by under a more aggressive enforcement regime.<p>The real test ought to be: is the grant large enough to serve the purpose, i.e. to encourage people to produce creative works?  The answer at the moment seems to be manifestly that it is.  I would challenge you to find even a single example of a creative work that might have been produced but wasn't because of fear of piracy.",1326613076

That brand has taken years of focusing on Apple's/Steve Jobs's particular style of doing business and building products. We see people trying <i>now</i> to replicate that, but it took Apple all of the 2000s to get its brand to where it is.",1326611610

Yet what Campbell perceived about the mythological hero’s journey is true of startups as well: however dissimilar the stories may be in detail, their outline is always the same. Most entrepreneurs travel down the startup path without a roadmap and believe that no model or template could apply to their new venture. They are wrong.

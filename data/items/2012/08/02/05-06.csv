Although not a big fan of GoDaddy, I have both searched and purchased tons of domains with them and atleast to my knowledge, they don't put a hold on the searched domains. You can do a simple experiment: search for the domain ""acmenewdomain.com"" in Godaddy, wait for a few mins/hours and see if it is available at say Gandi.net. \nHowever, I can't say the same about Network Solutions.<p>For the paranoid, just do a whois lookup yourself. If you have a linux machine edit your .profile and add ""alias whoise=/root/whoise"" to it. Then create a file /root/whoise and insert the following line into it<p>whois $1 | grep -i exp.*:<p>Now whenever you want to check for a domain's availability, just execute ""whoise domain.com"".

4327472,comment,4322767,4323911,4,0,dima55,,,"As others mentioned, zsh is compatible enough with bash to make switching relatively painless. There are many areas of zsh that are dramatically better, but the one that can make you fly is the fancy globbing that zsh has. More or less, you never need the 'find' tool when using zsh. For example, if I want to find all the Makefiles in this or child directories that have the string 'abc' and have been modified less than 1 hour ago, I can do<p><pre><code>  $ grep -l abc **/Makefile(mh-1)\n</code></pre>\nIf I want to look at the most-recently-modified file, I can<p><pre><code>  $ less *(om[1])\n</code></pre>\nIf I have a symlink 'dir' that points to a directory and I want to cd to the pointed-to directory, I can<p><pre><code>  $ cd dir(:A)\n</code></pre>\nClearly, there are lots of codes, but you don't need to remember them, since the tab-completion gives you online help. I can type the '(' then press 'tab', and it'll give me a list of the various codes that can follow and what they mean.<p>There are tons of others. If I want all<p><pre><code>  *\n</code></pre>\nEXCEPT<p><pre><code>  *.h\n</code></pre>\nI can use<p><pre><code>  '*~*.h'\n</code></pre>\nOr for instance, say I have a directory of photos. I want to pick DSC00095.jpg through DSC00107.jpg. In bash, you cry; in zsh I say<p><pre><code>  DSC<95-107>.jpg.\n</code></pre>\nAfter I've typed in the glob, I can press 'tab', and it'll expand the glob in-place, letting me know if the code worked without executing. I can then undo to get the code back and have it live in my history.<p>There are plenty of other non-globbing-related features of zsh that make it worth looking at, but this is one that doesn't get as much press as it deserves.",1343886419

Folks write all sort of controversial opinions (there was this essay a few months back from a UCSD professor in Bloomberg about how CS education is overrated and the folks in CS don't make enough money).<p>My response to these kind of articles is: everything is fair game. If someone or some community thinks CS or math is not for them, it's their right. It's just that the demand will be filled up by folks who do believe in it (like folks from outside US which constitute a significant portion of most CS/tech firms inside US). Ultimately, if some folks in US realize they are losing too much potential out there by refusing to raise their bar, they might re-orient towards the demand. If they don't realize this/stuck in their stubbornness/incompetence, then they didn't probably deserve it anyway (or don't care).<p>Agreed that there is short term pain for folks who get effected by these kind of policies outside their choice.",1343884182

Many cases these days include so much documentation provided during the discovery phase that it's very difficult to process.<p>Some of the technologies that I personally oversaw implemented at law firms include, 1) document scanning and indexing, 2) electronic document conversion, 3) native file metadata extraction and indexing, 4) document culling (filtering large document sets based on metadata and extracted keywords), 5) document review (to find document relevant to the case), 7) electronic searching of legal records (like Lexis-Nexis), 7) fax servers (true, law firms use a LOT of fax)<p>While I agree that there are areas in which law firm technology can be improved, there is a fairly healthy market for software solutions to improve productivity at law firms (though much is aimed more at secretaries and paralegals than attorneys).",1343884181

No cheating there (you lose, you're out) but you don't get a good feel for who is really the best since so few games are happening (log2(n)). Somebody can win just because they had an easy draw, even when you try to be smart with how you pepper seeds.<p>On the other end of the spectrum, you can do a 100% pool system: everybody plays against everybody else. The winner is very likely to be the best of all, but it's obviously an organizational nightmare that would take forever to complete  (n! games). Again, here, there is zero incentive to lose.<p>This is why most professional tournaments operate with a mix of these two: a set of small pools first that leads into a direct elimination system. The trick is to implement the transition so that you always want to win all your pool games. Seeds are supposed to take care of this problem, but it's not a guarantee.",1343884118

4327370,comment,4326771,4327346,6,0,rayiner,,,"To be fair, the author is a fresh law school graduate. What does he know about whether legal practice is inefficient or not?<p>I was a summer associate at a large New York law firm, and the level of technology was fairly typical for corporate America. We had a centralized document management system that integrated version control and generation of deltas. We had a centralized, searchable repository of every document generated for every client, which we could use to avoid duplicating effort when doing new work. We did everything via Blackberry e-mail and Outlook calendaring.<p>Beyond the generic ""you can always have better document management"" I'm not sure what else there was to do. The major legal research databases (Westlaw and Nexis) have god-awful interfaces, but there isn't much law firms can do about that, since there is a huge barrier to entry in that market (the proprietary databases).<p>The fundamental problem is that nearly everything you do for a client is a one-off. It's 90% similar to what you've done for a previous client, but that remaining 10% is not very amenable to technological automation. Can you write some software that will cross-reference an SEC disclosure against the client's big pile of haphazardly-assembled internal documentation, which are handed over in God-knows how many formats? If so, then you're going to make some serious money. If not, then well that's how that graveyard of failed legal technology companies builds up.<p>The big recent advance in legal technology has been software to speed up document review, which leverages document search technology that has really improved (and obsoleted a large number of discovery attorneys in the process). Law firms have been quick to embrace such software, as well as services such as ""in-sourced"" discovery centers in places like West Virginia. To date, legal technology hasn't advanced much beyond that, largely because computer technology for working with documents hasn't evolved much beyond search.",1343883954

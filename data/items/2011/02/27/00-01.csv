I'd be very surprised if the iPad2 was released with better hardware than what is in the TouchPad. WebOS is the best mobile operating system out there and it's such a shame that it wasn't handled better until this point. It has had features in it for years that all other mobile OSes are still trying to catch up to. Hopefully HP will do a great job marketing everything because that's the real key to competing with Apple.",1298768358

None of the Harvard Connection's code was used in Facebook; I doubt sincerely that there were any remarkable algorithms or anything like that in their code, either.<p>I had a Facebook-like idea around the same time that Zuckerberg did, when I was a freshman in college.

I think Haskell is dangerously close to the former category while C++ is firmly in the second. I appreciate ""smart"" for many tasks, but sometimes the operational semantics become important (e.g. it's performance-sensitive) and then you have to understand the stack at a pretty deep level and it can be awfully confusing why a tiny source-level change makes a big performance or space difference.<p>Sometimes I pretty much know what assembly I want and it's much easier to make a C compiler produce it than to get GHC to produce it.",1298768132

Angels and VCs contact you, I had two to three weeks of non-stop meetings, selecting who would be best to take money from, and we raised.<p>What Angellist did for us was (a) significantly decrease the time to raise money and (b) put us in front of VCs and Angels we never could have met on our own, not without at least dedicating months to the process.<p>My take - it empowers the entrepreneurs, which is why certain VCs don't like it.

I assume that would incur no performance penalty, as I believe slave writes don't slow down the master's performance -- only the rate of replication.<p>2. Async operations seem like a great idea, and in fact I was toying around with implementing something like that myself. How far along is your implementation, and how does it seem to behave so far?<p>3. About your proposed 'automatic slave read' idea: The way I understand what you wrote, it seems like you would end up incurring the same cost on the master and the slave, i.e., you make the request on the server, and if it takes longer than X msecs, you then issue the request on the slave. Instead, is there any merit to having a redis command that returns how much time is likely going to be required for a given command? It wouldn't have to be very precise -- I imagine even the rough order of magnitude would be helpful for deciding whether to get the data from a given master or its slave?",1298767079

A few years ago Wikipedia was  a content farm for me - being very ""on-topic"" it polluted the search results and the few times i clicked on it i was very disappointed by the content. Fast forward to today - majority of my on-topic search ends with me happily reading Wikipedia. Either i became more stupid or Wikipedia content became much more better. I believe it is the latter :)",1298766109
2266929,comment,2266536,2266536,0,0,yaxdotcom,,,"Sure, HTTP status codes should be used. But they aren't enough to communicate application-specific messages from an app backend to an AJAX front-end. For example, AJAX on the browser might submit a form and the server returns a 422 (HTTP validation error status code). How will you be able to inform the user that the ""email address must contain @"" or ""foobar is not an acceptable name""? You need to consume some JSON that has a payload of application-specific status messages.<p>I don't know if this proposal is optimal (smarter guys than me can decide that). But I know that a standard way of communicating application-specific errors would be a big step forward.<p>A year ago I searched for an adequate in-place editing plugin for Rails that didn't require major surgery to provide error messages to the user. I was surprised at the complexity required to handle a simple error condition. Usually Rails has all the goodness baked in but it seems application-specific status messages with JSON are out of scope. I asked ""How to show server errors in Rails with JSON and jQuery"" [1] on Stack Overflow and it's received more views than any other question I've ever asked.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2489567/how-to-show-server-errors-in-rails-2-3-5-with-json-and-jquery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2489567/how-to-show-serve...</a>",1298765987

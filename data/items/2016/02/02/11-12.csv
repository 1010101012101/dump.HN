Running it is a one-liner, and running it with Babel is one extra option. Its behaviour is reasonably transparent, so you can look at the actual output and see what is really going on even if source maps aren’t helping for whatever reason.<p>Personally, I’m not such a fan of Webpack. It trips my “too complicated” alarm, like RequireJS before it. I’ve never worked on a project that needed the kind of dynamic behaviour these tools support, and you pay a price for that flexibility in the complexity of the tool and the output it produces. Likewise, while you can include almost anything as part of your bundled JS output with Webpack, I’ve seen few real world cases where this is a significant advantage, and again you get locked into Webpack and its complexity as the downside. Perhaps on some types of project the features Webpack offers represent more compelling benefits.<p>For perspective, I’m also not a fan of tools like Gulp, also on the grounds that their ecosystems tend to be fragile and they add unnecessary complexity to what is usually a pretty simply operation in the first place.",1454413852

They exchange it for U.S. dollars or any currency in a country that pays a high interest rate on its bonds. They receive a low-risk profit when they receive high interest on the money invested, but pay low interest on the money borrowed. The broker pays the difference into the account each day the trade is open<p>>The yen carry trade is alive and well in 2015, but not with the U.S. dollar. That ended in 2008 when the Federal Reserve dropped the Fed funds rate to near zero. It continued with high-yield currencies such as the Brazilian real, Australian dollar, and Turkish lira. For example, many forex traders borrow near-zero yen to buy Australian dollars which have a 4.5% return.<p>This is where all the money lent out is going to go, from the Japanese negative interest rate to the new slightly above zero U.S bond yield.  Keeps the party going for a little while longer.  Follow the money.",1454413640

Usual reasons (very very cheap, like $20 and then $20/yr filing fees), good legal system, you can do nearly all tax/regulatory paperwork online/through APIs (in fact, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to do it by paper now).<p>Corp tax is 20% and up to £~45k pa you will pay no further income tax on dividends drawn down (though I think this is changing this year to 5%).<p>Flat rate VAT scheme is helpful for smaller companies.<p>But by far the best thing is the ridiculously good tax breaks the govt offers for startups, esp tech.<p>SEIS allows investors tax refunds for 50% of their initial investment, plus 25% if you fail. Which means for every £1 they put in, the govt is &#x27;underwriting/giving you&#x27; £3. And if you succeed they will pay no further capital gains tax on their realised gains.<p>R&D allows you to get back 23% of qualifying R&D costs in cash (or deducted off your corp tax bill).<p>Put those numbers together and you can see why you should incorporate in the UK...",1454413313

An underline has a very specific meaning. It is not just aesthetics. If put a handle on a door that you push to open, people will pull on the door on their first attempt. By doing this you&#x27;ve changed the meaning of a handle to all users of the building. Now, a user can no longer rely on the visual affordances provided by &quot;door handle&quot;.

Or is it just that they make profit, and thus the other users of the exchange are losing money? And if it&#x27;s the latter, how is that not completely illogical? In order for you to make a profit when trading, somebody else needs to lose money. If you ban everyone who profits from the exchange, then there cannot be an exchange, right?<p>Theoretically you make your profit from long-term value investing. If you think FooCorp has a bright future ahead of them and I think their industry is in decline, I can sell you my FooCorp shares. And theoretically we&#x27;ve worked for any money we make: maybe I&#x27;ve done some research and uncovered a massive fraud at FooCorp. Maybe you&#x27;re an activist who&#x27;s going to talk to their management about a major restructuring plan[1].<p>You can run an exchange just with value investors like that, but you won&#x27;t get a lot of trades - see the mention of Liquidnet in the article. Maybe you finish your plan a week before I finish mine. So maybe there&#x27;s a middleman who&#x27;ll sell you some FooCorp shares (going short), and then buy the same shares off me a week later, taking a cut for themselves. On one level they&#x27;re providing a valuable service - but you can see why you and I, who did all this research effort, might hate some people who sit there with a computer being a middleman and raking in near-riskless profit. In the same way that we might hate a real-world middleman - a salesman or importer or the like. It becomes particularly acute if the middleman is an HFT selling shares that we &quot;could have got on our own&quot; five seconds later at a better price than their price (because they have an information advantage from e.g. direct feeds being faster than the SIP). In one sense they are still providing value, but it&#x27;s a strange, counterintuitive kind of value. And of course people remember the times when they bought and the price went down a second later more than the times when they bought and the price went up, and it&#x27;s easy to blame the HFTs for it.<p>[1] Why is this not just zero-sum? Because ultimately the market cap turns into real investment. If the market overall thinks that BarCorp has a great business plan and FooCorp is wasting money, then the price of BarCorp goes up and that of FooCorp goes down, and maybe BarCorp builds a new factory and FooCorp lays some people off. Assuming the market got it right, BarCorp&#x27;s factory is more efficient than FooCorp&#x27;s, so they build more useful widgets with the same money, and the world has more widgets in it than in the counterfactual universe where the companies&#x27; prices didn&#x27;t change - real value creation",1454411092

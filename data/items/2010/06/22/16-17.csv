1452404,comment,1451496,1451496,0,0,1053r,,,"I think a lot of us are instinctively reacting negatively to this article, and I don't think it is because it's news we just don't want to hear.  There is one point that the author fails to take into consideration: future growth.<p>Anyone who has used iPad or iPhone or an Android device can tell that devices like these, not Symbian or WAP or Brew or whatever, are the future.  Those other platforms might catch up, but for now they lag abysmally behind in terms of user experience.  And so while they might outnumber iOS and Android for now, that numerical advantage can not last.<p>Walk around a Y-Combinator event (or CES, or E3, or anywhere else where leading edge alpha geeks congregate) and count phones.  I'd be willing to wager a lot of money you'd see a bunch of iOS and Android devices, a few blackberries, and a smattering of ancient nokia and samsung free phones held by users who ""just want to make calls"" (and thus aren't going to be reachable by any apps at all, WAP or Java or otherwise).<p>So, yes, a company developing an app today for iOS or Android isn't going to make their money back on the platform as it stands in any reasonable amount of time.  But a company or developer who positions themselves to be on top of a platform that is rising meteorically (and will displace literally billions of feature phones over the next decade and a half as moore's law drops silicon costs by a factor of 1000) is going to do well.<p>Hype is about future expectations.  When expectations rise above exponential growth in our industry, those expectations usually turn out wrong.  But the mobile market has a current penetration of over 3 billion people and I'll wager practically every phone on the planet will be a ""smartphone"" in under 15 years.  That's a lot of headroom for growth.",1277225656

Hadoop[1], HBase[2], etc. Depending on what you are trying to accomplish of course, you could also include Lucene[3], Solr[4], Mahout[5] and Weka[6] in that list.<p>Of course cool Java libraries don't mean you have to work in Java.  Scala[7] seems to be gaining quite a bit of momentum, as does Clojure[8].<p>From your reading list, it sounds like you may be interested in predictive analysis, machine learning, etc.  If so, Python[9] is pretty popular in those circles and has some nice libraries available as well[10].  And you can do neat things like use a Hadoop cluster for map/reduce processing, even if you have a client written in Python (or whatever)[11].<p>Of course Map/Reduce[12] isn't the only distributed processing model out there.  You might want to learn MPI[13] then explore the MPI bindings that are available for many (most?) languages, and look at other models of distributed / parallel computing.<p>Anyway, to summarize, I'd say that if you already know one or more of Java, Python, C, C++ or Scala, you're in good shape.  If not, some combination of the above should fit the bill.  And yes, R might be handy as well.<p>Not to take anything away from Erlang, Haskell, Forth, Factor, Scheme, Lisp, OCaml, Perl, or any other language of course.

It is entirely possible today with sites such as that to cherry pick an absurdly easy course load.<p>""Also, in my experience going for a 4.0 is much more difficult than a 3.0""<p>I completely agree.  To get a 3.0 for most majors you simply have to show up to class and tests and complete all of the assignments.  Thats it.  The problem is that 3.0 is the new average.  This isn't how grades should work.  Average students should get 2.0 GPAs.  I think the average GPA at my school is about 2.9.  Obviously, this is from GPA inflation.  I agree though that getting a 4.0 is still very difficult and impressive.  I just can't motivate myself to try and get one because I don't find my major terribly useful, nor do I think GPA really matters for me.  Besides I would have to soak at 5x as many hours into studying...",1277223156

A written version of this talk, along with a transcript of the discussion that followed, appears in the conference proceedings [45].<p>Van Wijngaarden’s goal was to formulate a preprocessor that would translate Algol 60 into a more restricted sublanguage. The final stage of the preprocessing was (what we would now call) a transformation of proper procedures into continuation-passing style (CPS) [41], with an at- tendant elimination of labels and goto statements. (An earlier stage of the preprocessing replaced function procedures by proper procedures.)\nAs van Wijngaarden described the transformation:<p>Provide each procedure declaration with an extra formal param- eter — specified label — and insert at the end of its body a goto statement leading to that formal parameter. Correspond- ingly, label the statement following a procedure statement, if not labeled already, and provide that label as the correspond- ing extra actual parameter. [45]",1277222933

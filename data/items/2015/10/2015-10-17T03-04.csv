Outliers don&#x27;t mean they work in all cases.
Again, I point to the fact that these are societal problems, you can&#x27;t criticize writers and producers of a TV show with this burden. They aren&#x27;t incarnations of Mahatma Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. They&#x27;re just trying to make money, it&#x27;s a TV show for the umpteenth time.",1445054266

This dialogue between Jose Valim (creator of Elixir) and Robert Virding (originally worked on the Erlang team, and creator of LFE) has some interesting contrastting points [1]. Summary: Elixir cannot define new syntax in the true Lisp sense, while LFE can. Elixir has improved the interface to the Erlang libraries, while LFE uses them &quot;straight&quot; from Erlang.
I think Elixir has more momentum due to the resurgence of interest in the BEAM, and the Ruby-like syntax and Ruby&#x27;s and ROR&#x27;s already-large community. I&#x27;ve never chose a language for popularity, hence why I still use Lisp. I do like Elixir and LFE a lot.

Predicting an M:N scheduler is.... not easy.<p>This is part of why Rust removed the M:N scheduler and light-weight threads before Rust 1.0. It&#x27;s hard to predict your memory use if the run-time is going to be creating/destroying OS threads, and juggling your lightweight threads (goroutines/etc) between real OS threads.<p>I agree entirely that the next iteration you write to solve the same problem is going to be better than the one before.

If the company merely &quot;treads water&quot;, then ends up getting acquired for lower than its previous valuation, it&#x27;s likely that your shares will be worth little if anything (after preferred stock liquidation preferences).",1445051626

If you&#x27;ve got the ability to generate old media press and can raise $500k (rule of thumb), then O-1 is a good fit. If you&#x27;re from the right country with $50k-150k, then E-2. If you&#x27;re from Australia, E-3.<p>For the O-1 in particular, the three criteria we tend to use are media coverage, mentorship/conferences, and high salary for those who have been employed previously to becoming entrepreneurs.<p>YC asked the White House to make some tweaks to the O-1 to be a more straightforward path for founders, but the White House went in a different direction with something yet to be announced.<p>We have the Global EIR program which might be of assistance.

10403260,comment,10402943,10403241,0,0,birken,,,"A low strike price only matters if there is some eventual liquidity for the shares.  For common stock this means IPO, acquisition or some other share buyback.  Both IPOs and acquisitions generally don&#x27;t apply to companies &quot;treading water&quot;, only the extremely successful and growing ones manage to IPO (and even then it doesn&#x27;t work out so great for shareholders: see YELP or BOX) or get acquired.  Get acquired for less than your ultra-inflated valuation?  Then the common shareholders get killed by liquidation preferences.<p>And as for other share transactions, you&#x27;ll need to find a buyer.  Most savvy investors aren&#x27;t going to be willing to pay huge valuation premiums for common stock.  And if they aren&#x27;t going to pay a premium, then you really haven&#x27;t gained anything by issuing common shares at a lower strike price.<p>So basically, common shares have lower strike prices because they are worth less....

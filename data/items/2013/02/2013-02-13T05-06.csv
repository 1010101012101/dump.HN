It needs a knowledge of how to <i>use</i> theorems and results and what the conditions are for 
a result to be applicable.  But there is no need to do the proof.  Especially since many many proof sare quite idiosyncratic and give no help in suggesting how one thinks like that.<p>Using the analogy of the car I am talking about teaching someone who rides a bike to drive a car.  My explicit non-goal is being a mechanic of <i>any</i> kind.  So your example of modifying your car is a strawman.  That's exactly what I assert a student-driver doesn't need and *shouldn't have to do.  It is going to be pretty much useless in actually learning how to steer and how to follow traffic rules.  One is about proper usage, the other is about understanding internals.  Sorry I still disagree and reassert that proofs are no use at all and a huge distraction for programmers trying to learn math.  There is so much valuable and useful 
work a programmer can do even using existing mehods without ever modifying them.  Especially with special purpose languages like R and MATLAB - the underlying algorithm are very mature and a first time user is not expected to modify them.<p>Quite separately I think it's extremely valuable to learn/relearn the foundations of math but this is for anyone and not specific to what a programmer needs to do useful things with math. Yes and it should be taught in high school math.  It's not taught bec the teachers didn't learn it that way and so it goes ...",1360735113

Seamless federated data sources, powerful multi-dimensional calculations, easy (re)formatting and charting, and very, very fast delivery, usually around 5-10% of that of some ""killer app"" from a team of developers the client couldn't afford. And around 5-10% training time, too, because say what you want about their idiocy level, users GET Excel, quickly.

People with grand visionary ideas always seem to get two things wrong:<p>1) They underestimate problems with their ideas, and then brush them off with solutions which, when summed together, make the visionary idea much less palatable. For example, the idea that we can abandon traffic lights and stop signs is complicated by the fact that not everybody can, will, or even should use a car to get around. But in the world without traffic lights and stop signs, pedestrians and cyclists are trapped by fear. Sure, they might technically be able to walk out into traffic and the wondercars will stop for them, but in reality, nobody will do that, because the cost of being wrong is death. In every conversation I have had with these technophiles, the solution always ends up being some massively costly network of pedestrian bridges  at every intersection of the city. Yeah, not so palatable anymore.<p>2) They fail to understand that, like evolution, intermediate states have to be viable improvements on their own merits. Wheeled animals do not exist, not because wheeled animals wouldn't have superior mobility, but because no possible intermediate evolutionary state has incremental benefit over the previous legged state. How do you transition a 2 lane road into three lanes when only 50% of the cars are self-driving? What about when 99.9% are self-driving?

(And my bios service tag not properly reset after one of the motherboards). Through all of this, Windows somehow got the idea that I was pirating it (okay, pretty clear where it got this idea from). The license key that came with the CD did not work. After several boot cycles and re-tries at activating windows, I decided to try again, and when it failed that time I would use the activate by phone option. Somehow, when I ran the activation executable that time it activated without any further prompts. Not entirely sure what this story says about MS's computer fingerprinting.<p>Also, I left out of the story that: After the last hardware change windows booted several times without issue. After the first time it complained it was invalid the computer would fail to boot until I re-installed GRUB from a live cd.
Between the GRUB incident and windows activating I identically let windows install updates (which I thought couldn't be done from an unactivated install). After these updates, when you try to log on, you get a fatal error in its attempt to launch 'your copy of windows might not be genuine' program, followed by a failure to launch explorer, followed by a black screen. I looked up the error, and it seems to be a result of the update unrelated to the activation issue. Booting into safemode and installing the update solved that.

I know this because Santa Monica actually has a city website with live tracking of parking spots remaining at each of it's city lots.<p>> If there were stronger price incentives (meaning make high demand lots and street spots more expensive while making under utilized lots and spaces dirt cheap) and advertising of the availability of the under utilized spaces, instead of the same garages filling up to the max and people freaking out that we need more and more parking, maybe we'd realize we actually have plenty. Then instead of wasting yet more land use and city money for more parking capacity, we could start making more open space for people, such as more park space and plazas.<p>That was before the new meter system.

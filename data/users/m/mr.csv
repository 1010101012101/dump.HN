I know, I know.<p>For 7 years, I spent 9 months of each year in remote Pacific South America, doing volunteer work - and surfing, quite a lot during the good season! Each year I&#x27;d return and do about 3 months of contract programming on-site with great teams.<p>Like pg says, lots of good projects, to really do them right, have to be companies. For that reason I can&#x27;t rule out doing a startup some day.

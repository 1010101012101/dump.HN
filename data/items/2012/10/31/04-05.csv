I upgraded from the iPad 2 and have no regrets (especially after selling the old model for $350). Even before there were rumors of a retina display iPad, I always thought the one flaw of the iPad 2 was the relatively ugly display.<p>On a related note, the added thickness and weight of the 3rd generation iPad does show Apple's prioritizing of battery life over portability. I actually have the opposite preference: I would love a retina iPad with the same size and weight of the iPad 2, even if it had half the battery life.",1351659589

In fact, I've been intentionally without a smartphone for close to 2 years now. I recently had a similar experience on a trip. I'll try to keep it short:<p>Recently I took a trip to San Francisco for the first time (and I'll admit I brought my deactivated Palm Pre along to take some vids). On my third day there I came upon a guy making a cool form of street art: he wrote his own quote-able thoughts on masking tape and stuck it on a piece of sidewalk. I'd say a quarter of a block was covered in this guy's thoughts.<p>I started taking pictures like a typical tourist, then I met the guy making the art. As I got to asking him about where he got his ideas and such, something occured to me: nobody else was even noticing this art. I asked him why and he said ""oh, a lot of people are too absorbed in their phones to stop and enjoy what's around them."" I promptly put my phone away, but he had already noticed it. To him I looked like a typical teenager obsessed with my phone. ""So where are you from?"" he asked. He knew I wasn't from around there just by the fact that I stopped to enjoy his art. It was a little depressing, and it reminded me why I gave up that amazing Palm Pre. But hey, at least I captured a few moments on camera I would have forgotten otherwise.",1351659286

This is one of the few times this has happened with Apple products I think, and to me it was significantly heavier. The iPad 2 was already stretching it as a one-handed device, the extra weight on the 3 was the deal breaker and it wasn't that fun to have it for reading in bed anymore for example. The iPad 4 has not fixed this as it is even heavier than the 3. I used a hover bar ( <a href=""http://twelvesouth.com/products/hoverbar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twelvesouth.com/products/hoverbar/</a> ) and it could no longer support the weight too :/ (yes this is less of an issue but was still annoying and really highlighted the ""trade-off"" feeling of the iPad 3).<p>2.

This doesn't seem like a great value proposition to me: ""after X time this will seem normal (not exciting), and everything else will seem like shit!"".<p>3.

I had a 64 GB iPad 2, and when moving to a 64GB iPad 3 and upgrading the apps they all increased in size by so much that I couldn't fit them all anymore (plus music, etc). This is particularly frustrating because it is 100% fixable by just having a system that distributes different binaries with different resources (with NO extra work to the developer).<p>I am incredibly excited about the iPad mini. I bought it at midnight when it went on sale and sold my iPad 3 without a second thought (which basically paid for the mini).

But do so knowing the risks associated with it. Any business you start will most likely fail. And many companies will require that you have a degree to get a job^. If you have a chance to move to SV then do it. There's a lot of negative aspects (group think, etc) but the positives drastically outweigh them. You'll have the opportunity to surround yourself with people who think big and take big chances...the type of people who are great at starting businesses. You won't find it anywhere else.<p>If not, then stay in college. A degree gets you a good amount of choice that you'd lose if you opt not to get one. But those choices are always when working for someone else. If that's something you can do (99% of the population) then the degree will go a long way.<p>I'm 34, now living in SV. Dropped out in my 3rd year to take a contracting gig at GM in the late 90s. If I knew better I would have came out to SV.

Now I'm on my second startup (normally spend 3 years at a ""real"" company between startups) but this time I have a wife who stays home and I have 2 kids. The lack of degree has not yet had a negative impact on me. But I don't know if that will continue.<p>^ I've not yet finished college and I never have trouble finding work between starting up.

If things ever go south, getting a job at a bigger company will be much easier.<p>- You learn a lot in a short time at university. A lot of this will be the type of things often asked in technical interviews, so it will generally make getting a job in the future easier (the CS interview process can be a little biased toward college type questions rather than industry type questions. Whether the system is broken is another topic). You will learn things in industry too, but if you stay in college you'll still learn them, just later. If you drop out, you might always wonder what topics you're missing out on.<p>- I don't feel like you're delaying your life by attending university, as that's generally what people expect you to do with the four years after high school, IMO.<p>As to how useful university has been, I found it very useful. But university, like many things, is what you make of it. It can be useless or very useful or somewhere in-between depending on what you do while there (what classes you take, what projects you work on in your spare time, possibly what clubs you find a fit in).<p>I've technically been in that situation, and my manager at the time encouraged me to finish my degree. But take this with a grain of salt; I would have finished my degree regardless of what anybody said at that point.<p>You have a better idea than anyone else of what's best for you, and you should make this decision, if it comes up, at the end of your internship rather than now. But I generally encourage people in CS to get their degree.<p>If you have any questions related to that, I'd be happy to answer them.",1351657152

Then I posted that on Facebook/Google+ as well, and more and more friends started posting telling me that they felt the exact same way AND that they too were getting better results from Google then Bing.<p>Yes, it is not a scientific study, but Bing's marketing isn't entire scientific in what ""nearly 2 to 1"" means either. Nearly 2 can be 1.5. Hell, ceil(1.1) is 2.<p>Google's search results have been improving more and more over time, for my technical searches (specifically related to programming) no other search engine even comes close in getting me the results I want. I do have Google's Web History turned on, which most likely allows Google to improve their search results better to what I will most likely want.",1351656173

The early ipod silhouette ads communicated tons of stuff with a a silhouette dancing to music while using an ipod. I could make a list of the features that were communicated in thirty seconds but I suspect almost anyone who saw the ads could.<p>I think that the key here is to communicate the RIGHT features and benefits. That's why I am so down on the Surface ad I saw.  I truly thought it was moronic.  What the hell were they communicating?  I asked my non-tech (Doctor) wife if she wanted one and the answer was:  ""it's just an iPad with that stand thing"".<p>Which makes my case.  All MS managed to communicate to my wife was that they have an iPad with a built-in stand ""thing"" that she couldn't care less about.",1351656076

There are literally dozens of vendors who would kill for that job here in the States - even without any guarantee of repeat order.  There just must not be very many there in the UK.<p>(I do understand some of what it takes to setup and run a manufacturing line, I work with several EMSes both in the US and China and run a [smaller scale] electronics manufacturer.)<p>Edit: Before my comment is taken the wrong way, what I am wondering is if the UK has much capacity for mid-scale EMS/CEM, or if the industry there has been largely tailored towards the very big players.  But, I'm pretty sure I misread the statement, namely that they meant that the only places willing to take the jobs were charging too much, rather than that no one wanted the job because it was too small.",1346954372

4485348,comment,4484627,4485213,3,0,chimeracoder,,,"> The two paradigms are not necessarily in conflict.<p>Agreed - that's my whole point. It's better to think of object-oriented programming as a construction within FP. Of course, some (badly-designed) OO languages like Java sandbox you and restrict your access to some of the more powerful, higher-order concepts, which is why they seem to be 'in conflict', when in reality, one is just a more abstractly implemented, whereas the other's more specifically implemented.<p>> Scala is a perfect example of a language which is both.<p>No, it's not - for example, functions have to exist within an instantiation of a class (a singleton object counts). By providing true first-class objects (unlike Java), you get many of the same benefits as first-class functions, but it's fundamentally not the same thing.<p>Really, an easy way to create a language which supports both is to start with a very basic language with true first-class functions and closures (like Lisp) and then define a few closures that encapsulate state (objects), and then add a couple of basic macros that turn generic functions into bound methods (ie, automatically provide the implicit parameter instead of calling it explicitly).<p>...which is why I agree that they're not in conflict - a well-designed OO system can be easily implemented within a well-designed functional system!<p>(The reverse doesn't work so well because you can easily add an implicit parameter to generic functions, but you can't completely remove an implicit parameter from a bound method, even if you pretend it doesn't exist - ie, treat all methods as static methods).",1346954303

4485346,comment,4484906,4484906,6,0,therealarmen,,,"Full text for those who get hit with a paywall:<p>---<p><i>By Hayley Tsukayama, Published: September 5</i><p>Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian has accomplished what virtually no one else in Washington is doing these days: bringing the political parties together on a controversial issue.<p>Democrats and Republicans have stepped up their support this year of Ohanians cause of keeping the Web free of government intervention. During their conventions, both sides touted a platform plank affirming Internet freedom.<p>And last week, President Obama stopped by Reddit for a surprise question-and-answer session, saying he would fight hard to make sure the Internet remains the open forum for everybody.<p>Republicans want to keep the open Internet safe from big government. Democrats want to keep it safe from big corporations. I say we agree to agree and move ahead, Ohanian said in an interview. It was so successful because we literally had the Tea Party next to the MoveOn.org guys at these meetings. They dont often hang out together.<p>Ohanians inroads in Washington is a homecoming of sorts for the Columbia, Md., native. But the 29-year-old never intended to go into politics. In 2005, he co-founded Reddit.com, where users rank the most interesting content on the Web. A mere 18 months later, Ohanian sold the site to Conde Nast at a price tag that some speculate was between $10 million and $20 million. The site draws about 35 million users.<p>His introduction to high-stakes Beltway politics came this year when he and other executives from Silicon Valley stopped a pair of bills that would have held Web sites accountable if they host pirated content. The effort overcame fierce lobbying from powerful constituents, including the Chamber of Commerce and the Motion Picture Association of America.<p>These groups complained that Web companies were enabling pirated content, stealing billions of dollars from artists, authors and movie producers. A spokesman for the MPAA said that while the Web should not be encumbered by regulation, smart legislation is needed to crack down on piracy.<p>Ohanians views are more uncompromising. He said that the government should have no role in policing the Web. He added that if Hollywood made it easier for consumers to get the movies, music and electronic books they want, there would be no need to pirate content.<p>If the Web is left alone, it will solve the problem of piracy on its own, he says.<p>If youre really interested in artists rights, look at the Internet and look at all this great art that it created, he said. Rhetoric that pits artists rights against the open Internet infuriates me, Ohanian said, because of the amount of content being funded by such online incubators as Kickstarter and Indiegogo.<p>His work this year on what was called the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, earned him allies on Capitol Hill.<p>Its been a pleasure to work with Alexis to stop SOPA and keep the Web open, said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). He brings to the table a deep knowledge of start-up culture and what makes the Internet tick and has a knack for bridging the gap between those worlds and government. And he got me onto Reddit.<p>Alexis is a technology innovator whose platform is changing the way people share, collaborate and affect policy change, said another of Ohanians close collaborators, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). Alexis and the Reddit community had a profound influence on the outcome of the legislative debate this year.<p>Since leaving the day-to-day operation at Reddit in 2009, Ohanians projects have included the geek-stuff-for-charity site Breadpig and the online travel service Hipmunk. He also launched a bus tour to highlight the importance of Internet freedom to the American economy.<p>The groundswell of support for Ohanian surprised some traditional lobbyists in Washington. But it was obvious to Ohanian, who says nearly everyone wants the Internet to be a free and open place.<p>The Internet represents so much of the awesomeness this country was founded on, he said. This is not a fight between Silicon Valley and Hollywood.",1346954292

With no treatment, everyone will die soon. You have the resources to produce a perfect cure for just 1/4 of the population, or a cure that works with probability 25%, but you can make enough of it for the entire population (expected number of people saved is the same).<p>Now, half the doctors are asked to decide between:<p>.... a treatment that deterministically saves 25% of the population from the epidemic, and a treatment that probabilistically saves 25% of the population from the epidemic.<p>The other half were asked to decide between:<p>.... a treatment that would let 75% of the population die from the epidemic (deterministically), and one that would probabilistically let 75% of the population die.<p>The whole test was built so that on average, there's no ""right"" choice. You just get to choose whether or not you want to determine who lives - but either way, 25% will live, 75% will die.<p>No, if people were rational (and doctors are supposed to be rational with respect to treatment policy), the way the question is phrased should not make a difference - but it made all the difference.<p>(K&T have many similar examples, and so does Dan Ariely in ""Predictably Irrational"").<p>Now, if the TSA phrases the questions, you can be certain the poll would indicate 95% of the people support the TSAs procedures. If Schneier did, the results would be very different.<p>Scientifically and accurately portraying the fact that most polls shouldn't be trusted because the person doing them has an agenda.",1346953379

Why else would they provide customers with refunds at the drop of a hat, but withhold money amounting to thousands  literally thousands and thousands and thousands  from buyers without any valid reason, when not even your bank is legally allowed do that?</i><p>The best part about them giving buyers refunds is that if you, as a seller, want to dispute their chargeback, you have to pay Paypal an administrative fee ^_^",1346952460

There is likely some inductive step going on, in selecting which algorithm (or 'sort' of the web) is selected, and then filtered by keywords.<p>Secondly, most search engines, actually do also use end-user curation. I have funky enough search queries, that I often get google redirects as search results: they want to know (and record) which link i pick. Also, because of all the google-adds-cookies, google-analytics-cookies, etc, they likely have 'session-bags' full of destination links and search queries that happen to correlate.<p>For me personally, neither search engine did very good in this test.

This is important because on most Mac systems, all the data anyone cares about is stored under the user's UID; nobody really cares about escalating privileges on a single-user system. What Keychain does is create a repository for data that can't be read even if you can execve() arbitrary programs under the UID of the owner of that data.<p>From that vantage point, a mechanism that breaches the Keychain for a superuser isn't interesting as a system-level flaw.

Scala isn't really competing for the same mindshare as Ruby/Python/etc., and for good reason. Scala is basically what Java <i>should</i> have been (or at least, that's the goal).<p>Scala is not truly functional - like Java, it is object-oriented. It just so happens that, once you step outside the Java bastardization of that term and think about a more 'pure' OO, the result is fairly functional-looking. OO and FP aren't really competing paradigms; rather, OO is a more complex paradigm that can be constructed from a functional
system. (The inverse is technically true too, but much uglier in practice).<p>(To give an example of what I mean, Scala supports first-class objects, and functions/methods are included in that statement. Scala does <i>not</i> support first-class, module-level functions (outside an object). That's not functional programming; it's object-oriented! But if you design your OO system well, you get something similar. Java does this badly, because methods aren't first-class objects - and unlike C, you can't really use pointers/references to fake the same behavior, so you get the worst of both worlds).<p>Of course, Scala has to deal with limitations of the JVM - that's their compromise to gain binary inter-compatibility - but the designs of the two languages are a night-and-day comparison.",1346950986

Lifetime employment also gives companies an incentive to invest in giving their workers expensive technical training, since they know the workers won’t just jump to a competitor once they have it.  Since a highly-trained workforce is one of the absolute keys to success in any advanced sector of the economy, this is very important.</i><p>This probably plain old doesn't work in a globalised world. If your best talent feel they're being undercompensated in relation to their knowledge (and they don't have much use for social status), then they'll emigrate. At the margins, this is precisely what seems to happen --- most famously in the case of Shuji Nakamura.<p>(To put the icing on the cake, I've read an even more conspiratorial theory than Robert Locke's: that the Japanese government deliberately sabotages their school system's ESL classes by overemphasizing translation work and underemphasizing conversational skills, to make it hard for people to emigrate successfully.

I lost the extra weight by eating 900 calories a day for a year and a half or so.<p>At my normal healthy weight, I was starving. And weak as a kitten. I took up running, and stopped watching my diet. I literally could not keep up the willpower necessary to continue a 3000 calorie diet, even though 900 had been doable for so long. Despite running for an hour a day, I immediately started gaining 10-15 pounds a month.<p>So I was convinced that it was all about calories. I was fat because I ate too much. Why my body was so hellbent on eating 4000-5000 calories a day, I didn't know. I seemed to have a lot more willpower than anyone else I knew. It was sort of confusing. Then about a year ago, I read Taubes' book.<p>What if the human body is actually sort of complicated? What if hormonal regulation controls fat? What if the ""trash bin"" theory of body fat is actually a humongous oversimplification or just wrong? What if, after getting to a ""healthy"" weight by starving fat, muscle, and vital tissue, I wasn't healthy at all? What if it had also made me malnourished (hence the amazing hunger at my ""healthy"" weight)?<p>Anyway, I cut the carbohydrates out of my diet last December. I made zero effort at calorie restriction. In fact, I ate <i>a lot</i>. I made very little effort to exercise more. After a year of this, I'm almost 100 pounds under my max weight. I recently started running again, for fun, not weight loss, and am up to 2-3 miles a day.<p>And I am stronger than I've ever been in my life. Eating steak every day is probably more expensive than building the same muscle mass with steroids, but I'm pretty happy. I wasn't expecting it. It's good being a carnivore.",1263051151

If anyone wants to continue where I left off, please feel free to.<p>16:30 - Introducing HFCS.<p>17:20 -Why use fructose? It’s sweeter. (Also, cheaper.) Should be able to use less. But drink manufacturers use it more. (Shows chart with different types of sugars and their positions on a sweetness index.)<p>18:20 - Chemical composition of fructose versus glucose versus sucrose. Fructose and glucose are not the same. Fructose and sucrose are exactly the same from a body processing perspective. Both dangerous.<p>21:50 - Slide: Secular trend in fructose consumption: Natural - 15g / day WWII - ~20g / day 1977 - ~37g / day 1994 - ~55g / day Current adolescents - ~73g / day It’s not that we’re eating more (although we are). It’s that we’re eating more sugar.<p>23:30 - How did this happen? Why did this happen? The politics perspective: three political winds that swirled at the same time, creating the perfect storm. 1. In 1972, Nixon makes food prices a “non-issue.” 2. 1966, HFCS invented, introduced to the US in 1975. This makes sugar CHEAP. “High fructose corn syrup isn’t evil because it’s metabolically evil, but because it’s economically evil. Because it’s so cheap, it’s found its way into everything.” 3. In the late 70s, the USDA, the AMA, and the AHA all call for the reduction of fat in diets. Why? To stop heart disease. Did it work? No. So why’d they tell us to stop eating fat? In the 1970s we discovered LDL. In the mid-1970s, we learned that dietary fat raises LDL. In the late 1970s, we learned that high LDL correlates to cardiovascular disease. So, the conclusion was that if A leads to B, and B leads to C, then A leads to C. But the premise is incorrect. Why? It suggests that it’s transitive. That isn’t the case.<p>John Yudkin - Pure, White, and Deadly.<p>Keys - performed multivariate regression analysis (running data to filter out what really caused what) on cardiovascular disease. Showed calories from fat correlated highly with cardiovascular disease. But he didn’t run a complete regression analysis. He showed that sugar comes along with the fat, and that if you hold saturated fat constant but increase sugar, it doesn’t show results. But he didn’t go the other way, holding sugar constant and showing that fat still has an effect. (around 35:00) So his results aren’t actually reliable, but we’ve been basing 30 years of nutrition education and policy on this incomplete study.<p>36:30 - Two types of LDL.

I think a lot of developers have those early cringe moments, especially if they were young when they started.<p>As far as disruption, it did occur to me later that somebody may be getting notification emails about these comments.  But it&#x27;s not too bad, as I assume they could just send the emails to /dev/null, since Github is not the official host of git.  (As a tangential note, I sort of wish Github would handle this better. So many Github-mirrored projects end up with something like &quot;don&#x27;t submit pull requests or open issues here, they will be ignored&quot; in their repo description.)",1416877197

However, while in practice, adherence to the module pattern can become quite annoying for very small modules. \nSmall modules usage throughout a project can change very quickly, because of this one may find themselves repeatedly adding a removing utility modules at a multiple times a day. Small breaks to npm install or remove small modules throughout your day can lead to a lot of wasted time (since it breaks your programming focus). Also, remembering which small module you used can be difficult (bc there may be many).\nI think there are pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s to each strategy.. \nIMO I think the micro libraries are an exception to the rule, where grouping them together can be beneficial to developers.",1416877189

That being said, I think we should use the ideas of science, and philosophy of science, to improve our art and make it more meaningful and fecund for ideas. Since the results of science have no intrinsic meaning at this point in time (nor do they say anything utterly conclusive about what really exists at the lowest level of ontology), we still need something else. Obfuscation is one way to encourage the reader to really understand the context and layers of some piece of writing by making them dig deeper (there was an interesting link about this a few weeks back).",1416876287

I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever read such an article.<p>I&#x27;m fascinated to see what they discuss? The choice between fatherhood and career, the preconceptions to behave in a particular fashion, the unfair dresscodes and lack of paternity rights?<p>Because an article is about people, and those people happen to have a joint characteristic, that doesn&#x27;t mean that the article is about that characteristic of those people. To recapitulate, if I right an article about people who inspired me growing up and it mentions Ronald Reagan and Michael Gorbachev that doesn&#x27;t mean the article is about &quot;light skinned males&quot; any more than if it were about Margaret Thatcher and Germaine Greer it would be about &quot;light skinned females&quot;.<p>FWIW the OP doesn&#x27;t really touch on being about being a female founder except in one para:<p>>&quot;We got an interesting variety of responses when we asked the women whether being a female was advantageous or disadvantageous in their roles as founders.&quot;<p>And in that the response appears to have been &quot;it didn&#x27;t make any difference&quot;.<p>Well if being a male and female founder is practically the same it does rather demand that we ask the question, so why are YC focussing on the sex of these particular founders then, what&#x27;s it got to do with anything.<p>There is this bit of unexplained sexism:<p>>&quot;And as YC has grown, so has the number of female partners. Now there are four of us and we are not tokens, or a female minority in a male-dominated firm. At the risk of offending my male colleagues, who will nevertheless understand what I mean, some would claim it&#x27;s closer to the truth to say that that we run the place.&quot;<p>In what way is it fine to pick out that &quot;we run the place&quot; and specifically note that&#x27;s related to being a particular sex? How is that cool. Maybe those people do run the place, but is that really because they&#x27;re a particular sex rather than because that&#x27;s the role they were hired for, or fell into, within the firm?<p>Why is YC so keen to maintain an actively demarcated line between males and females rather than just say Alex here is office manager, rather than noting first which sex Alex is.

The advantages of piping, currying and composition on first class functions simply cannot be overstated.<p>Okay, so the next thing, from String.sub line 0 3 it&#x27;s clear that you need to know the string length, hence the > 4 can&#x27;t be avoided. You could pack it away into a function but why waste time if you&#x27;re not going to write this 3 or more times?<p>The function `start` takes an env, a string list and returns unit. It&#x27;s a procedure. The function looks for a string that starts with &quot;+++&quot; and either fails to find and returning () else passes to `modified` (also a procedure, tail recursive) which goes through the list (line :: lines returns the head and the tail of the list) applying modifications to env by tracking which lines were modified. `Lines` is an integer list and `result` is an integer pair list, so hopefully it&#x27;s clearer now why your code is doing something completely different.",1416875237

Not only do you have to decode the instructions to find it, but you also have to handle conditional branches, which either involves figuring out which path with be taken and inserting the BRK in the appropriate location, or inserting the BRK into both paths (and having to restore both later).

And while you may have some respect for yourself and your profession, you don&#x27;t really have anything to do with this.  The images are processed at the hub of the system built to automatically sort the mail, and diverting those images to permanent storage or a network pipe requires nearly zero additional capital investment.<p>The only regulatory hurdle to prevent any cop in the U.S. from getting copies is a politely worded request, which does not necessarily need to be detailed or truthful.  And once one cop has it, nothing prevents him from sharing it.  There are already several nationally accessible systems in the U.S. run by a single county sheriff&#x27;s department, sometimes as a means of evading federal data retention rules.  We already know from media reports that such systems can be abused.  Cops look up themselves, friends, enemies, family members, ex-spouses or ex-lovers, celebrities, journalists, politicians, or whomever else strikes their fancy.<p>This bothers me for the same reason that widespread e-mail metadata collection bothers me.  It is done with callous disregard to the expectation I have as a free man that if I live my life without any criminal intent, I should be largely invisible to the enforcer class.  Innocents should have blank records in all those databases.<p>Instead, I feel that everyone now has an individually numbered target painted on the backs of their heads.

High-power-density fusion and antimatter-matter annihilation are the only sources I know of that make star travel thinkable on anything like a human time scale.",1416873722
8655498,comment,8654844,8655399,0,0,cbd1984,,,">  there was a massive campaign of neighborhood destruction<p>... driven by the fact most people who lived in cities, pre-WWII, didn&#x27;t live in nice gentrified neighborhoods with fixed-up brownstones and Local Character. They lived in slums with crappy, run-down tenements and whatever you call what happens when you shove as many people as possible into as little room as you can bribe someone to let you get away with. Crime and disease, that&#x27;s it.<p>Having a GI Bill education, a car which let you move even if the trolley schedule said you stayed put, and a house with a yard where your kids don&#x27;t end up in roving gangs sounded pretty damn good. It sounded like the American Dream.<p>> There is a robust hypothesis that city living is at the root of civic engagment and that, eg, the Great Migrations explain the timing of the civil rights movement.<p>To be clear, I agree with all this. My point is that it&#x27;s important to maintain historical perspective, lest we fall into the trap of imagining that people from the past weren&#x27;t reacting to comprehensible forces. Yes, some of those forces came down to frank racism, but others were as I mentioned above, and ignoring the good reasons while emphasizing the bad ones is not only an insult to history, it&#x27;s a stumbling block to understanding the present.<p>> major institutions have lost their ability to be as exclusionist as they historically felt necessary to prevent entryism that fundamentally changes the nature of the institution.<p>So... social clubs have to let in blacks, now? Is that what you&#x27;re saying?<p>> relentless focus on vacant aggregation-friendly metrics amongst our elite. You can put &quot;volunteer hours&quot; on a spreadsheet, thus, you get the optimal number of &quot;volunteer hours&quot;, rather than civic engagment per se.<p>If you don&#x27;t have rules, you have favoritism.<p>If you do have rules, you have rules lawyering.<p>If you have rules which are up to interpretation, you don&#x27;t have rules.",1416873714

I also asked because I&#x27;ve been suffering similar symptoms, and have been in the ER multiple times in the last couple weeks. The only thing I could possibly think of that spurred this on was getting a nosocomial infection 3 months ago and taking Ciprofloxacin for it. I had bad tendon pain and nerve pain while on the drug but it sorta went away after a week. 2 1/2 months later, it&#x27;s back full force and I&#x27;m getting very physically weak.",1416873691

You can argue that religion has been used in good and bad ways but one thing I think is hard to deny is that peoples spiritual beleifs have shaped societies and what social norms prevail.<p>The pro religion group could argue religion has had a civilizing effect on a species (homo-sapiens) that has compelled us collectivly to higher levels then our instinctual animal predecessors. The collective beleif in a set of shared moral values holds communities and societies together.<p>The anti religion group could argue that great atrocities have been justified in the name of religion. This group often argues that we should be basing our collective beleifs on science rather then religions. (Edit: I don&#x27;t beleive there are any examples yet of a large society being held together by a common beleif in science. The efforts to come up with a set of policies around global warming might be the closest thing I can think of and we all know how well that is going, not very well unfortunatly.)<p>By my estimation the human condition and the struggles we all face leave lots of room for different view points.",1416873632

65684,comment,65678,65678,0,0,aaroneous,,,"I think the answer really depends on the niche you want to go after. Do XBox360 fans need another social network login/pass to remember? I'd assume not, a Facebook community probably would be easier for them. <p>But, I'd also assume that there are viable opportunities out there that, by the nature of the niche, would function better as an isolated specialty site. Things like a social network for elementary school children would make sense in that context.",1191995587

65681,comment,65678,65678,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I would stay away from a couple of things. One is the ""social network"" label. Personally I think it's overused and it's meaning is starting to expand (I think a 1990 BBS would qualify as a social network today).<p>You might have a hard time with niche social networks. The primary reason being that the bigger players are building tools to allow folks to roll their own networks. So the chances are users won't want to get an account for every single niche network and prefer to stick to something from within the larger networks they belong to.<p>Depending on the exact niche market and just how special your site has to be for that niche market compared to the generic sites you might still have a good shot at building something useful. I would prefer some label like ""community"" over ""social network"" though. <p>I think del.icio.us, flickr, last.fm are great examples of community driven sites that serve a niche market.<p>Things like ""social network for wine lovers"" I think are likely to fail.",1191995171

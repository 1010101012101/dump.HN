I personally don't care for them -- I generally only see movies that I've read about online or heard about from friends.<p>A lot of people do like trailers though -- maybe set the start time of the movie to be the actual time the movie starts, and then let people interested in the trailers come early?  Or, maybe, have the trailers live up to their namesake and show them after the movie?<p>Maybe I'm in a minority -- do trailers bug anyone else?",1189702427

54274,comment,54186,54186,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"Denny says Gigamon ""contradicted Gartner"", and ""Gartner was dead wrong"". This is my space, too. All due respect, Denny, but, not so sure of your policework there.<p>Gartner predicted the demise of the standalone ""intrusion detection system"". Denny's product is enabling infrastructure for network monitoring and network security tools. It's not an intrusion detection system; it's lower on the value chain than that.<p>The market for intrusion detection systems, which are sold almost entirely to enterprises, evaporated in the 3 years following that Gartner report. There were several hundred million addressable dollars of it in 2003. Now there may be 50. <p>You probably don't care about this. But what you might care about is, there's a difference between bootstrapping a company into a 15MM/yr niche and funding a company to go after a billion dollar market. The former has an outcome like nCircle's, where you limp for the next 5-10 years of your life. If you do well, you get a ""lifestyle company"". The latter has an outcome like SourceFire, which involves private jets.<p>Lifestyle companies are great. But they don't have promising exits. The ""Paul Graham Way"" involves exits; murder yourself for 2 years, never work again. This is more the ""Joel Spolsky Way""; end up with private offices, a 4 day work week, and an Aeron chair.<p>We've been bootstrapping for a couple years now. It's definitely cost us time, and we have the constant hazard of falling into a lifestyle company. I'm not saying one approach is better/worse than the other. But if you're selling to enterprises, ignore the analysts at your own mortal peril.

54272,comment,54000,54192,0,0,koolmoe,,,">Using Lisp to read and write a configuration file means you don't need to worry about lexing and parsing either.<p>That was the point I was trying to make, apparently unsuccessfully.<p>>If you don't use Lisp, or if you don't use S-expressions, you will need to lex and parse the configuration file just to read it, compiler or no compiler.<p>Any time you build a lexer and a parser, you are building a compiler (I'm using a broader meaning of compiler - not necessarily one that outputs bytecode).  There are many XML-to-HTML compilers, for example.<p>Lisp macros compile DSL's to Lisp.  That's why a Lisp programmer rarely needs to think about lexing and parsing.  It is automatic and implied if you address the problem in the right way.  It's also why the concepts of data and programs are necessarily conflated in Lisp.",1189701118

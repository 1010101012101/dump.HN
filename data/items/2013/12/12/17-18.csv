6895886,comment,6894593,6894593,1,0,userulluipeste,,,"&quot;People need to work. They need to have something to feel good about doing every day. Work is a big part of self image and self worth. Any system that makes it possible for people to sit at home eating bon bons (as the Gotham Gal likes to say) is not a good system.&quot;<p>This reminds me about the importance of choosing our questions. The quoted piece is focused on the individual, and I presume that the feed-back would be accounted on that level too. The thing is, any given system makes things easy/comfortable for some kinds of individuals and not so much for the other kinds, so framing the problem around a generic citizen doesn&#x27;t bring up in my view even a stable desirable target. (The communist system is the first relevant example that comes to my mind - they thought that they can afford to please just the limited kind of individuals that happened to form the mediocre majority. They were wrong, of course. They avoided mass unrest and violent revolutions, but suffered brain drain Ã  la &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.) The framing level that I see relevant in this regard comprises the entire humanity and considers the effects on its entirety - what will allow us (all of us) to evolve, to get better, to &quot;get there&quot; (where &quot;there&quot; is to be continuously defined). Please note that I didn&#x27;t tried to answer the question that was being implied, I merely tried to fix it.",1386871177

6895879,comment,6859832,6864956,1,0,Goladus,,,"Some possibilities:<p>-Bitcoin is not legal tender.  Governments force banks to accept USD to pay debts, no matter what they perceive the dollar&#x27;s value to be.  Meanwhile banks have no obligation to accept bitcoin.  This means that bitcoin volatility is more closely tied to perception than currency.  This is a trait shared by other commodities.<p>-Bitcoin&#x27;s finite supply.  Once the supply of bitcoins is growing substantially slower than the size of the economy, there will be deflation until demand for bitcoins adjusts.  With a fiat currency, money supply can be increased or decreased as the size of the economy changes.  In a growing economy, a small level of inflation discourages hoarding and helps ensure that the currency accurately reflects the value of goods and services.<p>People say this means &quot;bitcoins are deflationary&quot; but that&#x27;s not precisely true.  It&#x27;s true only if the size of the economy using bitcoins for currency is growing.  In an economy that is stable and not growing, there should not be much deflation even if there is a finite amount of currency.  If the economy grows, then a fiat currency can print money to cover the growth.  Bitcoin cannot.<p>Thus, I would predict that unless bitcoin experiences a hoarding/deflationary spiral and crash into irrelevancy, it will wind up stabilizing in a particular niche of the economy, one that will likely become proportionally smaller over time as the world economy grows.  This particular niche is likely to grow and contract more frequently than the larger economy meaning that demand for bitcoin will continue to fluctuate more than major fiat currencies.  Given bitcoins fixed supply, this means price volatility.<p>Is this identical to other commodities?  In some ways, I suppose, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a particularly interesting question one way or the other.",1386871061

I think my test below automatically displayed the image because my own email address appears to be implicitly a whitelisted sender (even though &quot;images from this sender are always displayed&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear for it). Whether Google will alter the behavior when they actually deploy this feature, I don&#x27;t know.]<p>[Original message:]<p>I just tested and, yes, Gmail only loaded the referenced image when I clicked on the message to open it within Gmail. I can&#x27;t be sure, because perhaps if I had waited an hour without opening the message, Gmail would have automatically loaded the image anyway. But in reply to mherdeg below, the evidence suggests that, yes, Gmail plans to opt everybody in to sending &quot;read receipts&quot; by default for HTML messages that reference images.<p>I&#x27;m surprised by Google&#x27;s statement that the previous behavior of prompting was &quot;to protect you from unknown senders who might try to use images to compromise the security of your computer or mobile device.&quot;<p>I realize this was <i>a</i> benefit, but I always thought the main purpose was for privacy --- not to betray to the email sender when I opened the email.

Remember in the olden days when there were local papers that people did actually pay for? I delivered them as a child and I did find them rather dull at the time. However, looking back, you could have small ads and sports news that would reach a target audience of locals. There were also syndicated articles, e.g. new car reviews, that were okay to read. If something actually happened in town, e.g. a book signing, a gig or even a jumble sale then it would be in there. Things the council wanted to tell you were in there. Then there were letters, probably one of the more interesting pages.<p>The problem nowadays in the UK is not just national/global news it is also with the local news. We have the Internet and those local papers have moved online, however, it is not working.<p>As for the relationship the press have with the politicians, the press need access or else they cannot write anything.

Consequently the delivery strategy can better match financials. They can do things like meet you as you get home.  Or wait somewhere for 30 minutes to better match delivery windows.

6895667,comment,6895502,6895502,42,0,jxf,,,"> When people are doing a physical task, itâs easy to assess how hard they are working. You can see the physical movement, the sweat. You also see the result of their work: the brick wall rising, the hole in the ground getting bigger. Recognising and rewarding hard work is a pretty fundamental human instinct, it is one of the reasons we find endurance sports so fascinating.<p>We&#x27;ve all heard about the stereotypical manager-perception of &quot;effort invested will be proportional to results delivered!&quot;, like the article laments. But this analogy breaks down really quickly.<p>Let&#x27;s use an example that&#x27;s not from software to illustrate the point -- in fact, let&#x27;s use the author&#x27;s own example, laying bricks. Who would you rather hire?<p>-- Bricklayer A: Takes 2 weeks to finish a wall, stays late every day to finish the job, finally builds a brick wall of passable quality.<p>-- Bricklayer B: Finishes your wall in two hours because he realizes there&#x27;s a better way to lay your bricks, and builds a wall of excellent quality.<p>I feel like most people, even managers of non-software folks, would rather hire B. At least, I certainly would.<p>So I think the premise of the article is wrong. There&#x27;s something deeper going on, and dismissing it with &quot;managers want to reward hard work, and creatives don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re working hard&quot; is an explanation that is &quot;neat, simple, and wrong&quot; [0].<p>[0]: <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken</a>",1386869374

6895624,comment,6894244,6894244,2,0,alecdbrooks,,,"I am often frustrated by news and think much of it is worth ignoring, but many of the points are not very well-supported.<p>&quot;News has no explanatory power&quot;: I&#x27;m not going to argue that most mainstream news is even that good, but to suggest that &quot;the accumulation of facts&quot; is inconsistent with forming deeper knowledge is too sweeping. Readers of news can observe patterns, which hopefully they will check against more in-depth research.<p>Much of news&#x27; task to not the &quot;how?&quot; but the &quot;what?&quot; and on that measure, it does a decent, if inconsistent job: <a href=\"http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2011/knowless/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2011/knowless/</a>.<p>&quot;News is toxic to your body&quot;: The author cites a case study involving the limbic system that doesn&#x27;t mention media or news at all. It may well be that &quot;Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid&quot; but do they do so at noticeable or unhealthy levels? I&#x27;m not convinced.<p>&quot;News increases cognitive errors&quot;: News is not an ideal way of challenging biases, but it seems much better than not reading news and getting information about filtered through friends with similar biases to you. (Reading carefully filtered news and books is probably best of all.)<p>&quot;News inhibits thinking&quot;: This section only applies if you read news intermittently and let notifications interrupt you. Concentrating on a newspaper (or news site) for 30 minutes would not have the same effect. But continually leaving work for chatting co-workers would.<p>&quot;News works like a drug&quot;: This section is one of the most plausible, but once again, it doesn&#x27;t cite any evidence. Cal Newport has a similar line of reasoning, but he actually has research to back it up: <a href=\"http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/06/10/is-allowing-your-child-to-study-while-on-facebook-morally-equivalent-to-drinking-while-pregnant/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/06/10/is-allowing-your-child...</a>. (It&#x27;s about Facebook, but the same principle of distracting activities ruining focus applies.)<p>&quot;News wastes time&quot;: This is all about habits and boundaries. Like &quot;News inhibits thinking,&quot; this problem could emerge with any activity engaged in on a whim during working hours.<p>&quot;News kills creativity&quot;: The theory that younger mathematicians are more productive is actually unfounded. See <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/do_the_math/2003/05/is_math_a_young_mans_game.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.slate.com/articles/life/do_the_math/2003/05/is_ma...</a> or <a href=\"http://privacyink.org/pdf/myth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://privacyink.org/pdf/myth.pdf</a>. And this last part is pure argument by anecdote:<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know a single truly creative mind who is a news junkie â not a writer, not a composer, mathematician, physician, scientist, musician, designer, architect or painter. On the other hand, I know a bunch of viciously uncreative minds who consume news like drugs.&quot;<p>The points about most news being irrelevant to day-to-day life and story bias are worth pondering, but otherwise this article overreaches. It is a series of interesting conjectures about the effect of news, but often presumes a certain way of reading or watching news. The evidence for each point is slim. I&#x27;m forced to conclude his warnings of &quot;panicky&quot; news with &quot;no explanatory power&quot; are hypocritical.",1386868910

Some businesses, like fashion, are almost entirely &quot;photo&quot; based. Others, like food, cars, etc. rely on it extensively.<p>Here&#x27;s an example in which, for arguments sake, we state that all non-photo factors are equal and the best they can be.<p>Your business spends $100,000 a year to have top quality photos taken for the products you sell and you find the photos lead to a five to ten fold improvement in sales vs. stock or no photos. Now say all your competitors just steal your images and use them for their sites. Your sales drop back to where they were and your advantage is gone. And now you&#x27;ve got to make up the $100,000 to top it all off.<p>Having a watermark won&#x27;t stop lesser competitors from sealing your image, but other &quot;on par&quot; competitors will likely not due to potential litigation.

This isn&#x27;t what happened here, and I actually think what happened here is a model for starting to think about the &quot;working class&quot; going forward. The fact that lots of &quot;working class&quot; jobs are gone now is causing serious problems - but what if what we traditionally think of as the working class becomes low-level IT and other, newer fields. It&#x27;s not about teaching everyone to code - it&#x27;s about re-thinking the economy.",1386867684

6895482,comment,6892935,6894408,11,0,nfoz,,,"Because of the inability of most modern PC floppy drives to read Amiga disks (since Amiga floppies use sectors outside of the appropriate &quot;readable&quot; range for PC disks, IIRC), it can be hard to convert Amiga disks to ROMs.<p>However, in ~2000 there was a mechanism discovered whereby you can take two PC 3.5&quot; floppy drives and get a ROM from an Amiga disk.  The way it worked is you have one PC disk that will be destroyed, and you instruct the floppy controller to do a low-level floppy-to-floppy copy operation from the Amiga disk to the (burner) PC disk.  The CPU will listen in on the copy and get the full Amiga disk image, while the PC disk gets overwritten with junk.<p>I used this mechanism and saved all my old Amiga files, and happily play many of my old games (awesome retro demo-scene crackers/trainers included! yea!) using the UAE emulator to this day.",1386867647

The problem is <i>not</i> too little money, it's too much research because of the massive incentives to crank out crap, and the inability of the expert funding committees to sort through it all. Kickstarting this will just lead to funding the flashiest pseudoscience. We need to allow researchers more freedom to produce rarely, not encourage hype even more.",1364086794
5430560,comment,5429824,5430234,6,0,lbarrow,,,"I graduated from one of those Minnesotan miracle school districts in 2007. I think I got a reasonable education -- it wasn't great compared to what people in private schools got, but it set me up to succeed in college.<p>I now live in Chicago, which is the third largest school district in the United States. It's completely broken.<p>* The schools are massively segregated -- both by income and by race. The wealthy leadership of the city clearly decided a long time ago to give up on the public school system and send their children to private school. Even in middle class neighborhoods like Hyde Park, the divide is clear: if you're poor or black, you go to the local public school. If you can afford it, you don't.<p>* The school district is trying to close down 50 odd elementary schools, almost all of them in the ghettos. Why? Because population loss has eroded the tax income from those areas to the point where they can barely operate anymore.<p>* The entire teachers union went on strike for a few days earlier this year to protest salary and benefit cuts, increased testing, and the city's neglect for the school system. They didn't really win -- the salary cuts were mostly averted, but the tests keep rolling in.<p>* For every 100 students who enters CPS as a freshman in high school, only 6 ever get a bachelors degree.<p>The schools back home in Minnesota aren't perfect or even particularly good. They're mediocre. They're ok. But they're so much better than in Chicago (and many other parts of the country) that I will seriously consider moving back to Minneapolis when I start having kids.",1364086792

The primary advantage of having spam-blocking integrated into the search engine is that the user sees a full page of results for their query, even if some results were filtered out.<p>If the Chrome extension supports server-side filtering, then it must be sending some sort of ""exclude results from these sites"" message to google.com.

Wallets don't.<p>You seem to operate entirely in a world where inflation is the only thing that occurs. You ignore the fact deflation can and has occurred. Japan, for example, has experienced prolonged deflation and continues to face it today. So under your hypothesis, banks shouldn't exist in Japan because they are a place we put money to prevent it from losing value.<p>You also seem to be confused by monetary supply and its relationship to inflation and deflation. Just because a supply is fixed doesn't mean inflation and deflation don't happen. Look at price stability when we were under the gold standard[1]. Under your assumption we shouldn't worry about price volatility, except we experienced worse shocks while under the gold standard than without it. Inflation and deflation aren't inextricably linked to monetary supply. People play a large role, you can print infinite money but if people are afraid to spend it, you still won't experience inflation.<p>On a side note, it continues to amuse me to watch Bitcoin and the people who are passionate about them rediscover all the things banking discovered over the past few thousand of years. The ideas are hardly new and have been tried, yet the results are ignored.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/why-the-gold-standard-is-the-worlds-worst-economic-idea-in-2-charts/261552/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/why-the-...</a>",1364086561

You frequently see highly upvoted answers that aren't among the top answers and similarly answers with relatively few upvotes at or near the top.<p>How quickly late answers gather upvotes seems to be a big factor. I'm also fairly certain the relationship between the upvoter and upvotee plays a big role. For example if you frequently upvote a persons answers, that upvote carries much less weight than if you upvote some random noob. And if you downvote somebody whom you frequently uvpote, that seems to count as a super downvote.<p>Also, not all answerers are treated equally. Answers from a person with an algorithmically good (or bad) track record start out higher (or lower) than for others. This happens to me on a couple of topics where I've had popular answers.

The most successful tech guys I have know dropped out of school, and learned to program on their own<p>To a large extent, given the values of US universities, that's mostly inevitable.<p>What are such values?  In a university, the profs are expected to be doing 'research', not just teaching what's already on the shelves of the libraries or in commercial products.  In computer science, the 'research' is supposed to be finding the 'fundamentals' of computing, e.g., the question P versus NP.<p>So, there can be some first courses in computer science that concentrate on teaching a programming language, maybe Java, and then some later courses in algorithms, data structures, compilers, database, etc., but, still, turning out people ready to 'hit the ground running' in a serious programming team is not really the goal.<p>Now, there are community colleges, but there is a 'quality' problem:  First, the better students tend to go to universities.  Second, where is a community college going to get someone who is a right up to date software team leader to teach and, also, do a really good job teaching with preparing the course materials and giving individual attention to the students?<p>Net, at least in the US, it's long been the case in computing that mostly or even entirely have to be self-taught.  Heck, I've taught computing to undergraduates at Georgetown and to graduate students at Ohio State but I essentially never took a course in computing and, instead, was self-taught and before such teaching had a good career going in industry.<p>Self-taught's largely where it's at.  Sorry 'bout that!<p>Solution?  If you can think of a topic that needs some good teaching, then get smart on the topic, write a book, sell it in some form, maybe Kindle, develop some lectures and put them on YouTube, have a blog, etc.",1364086131

The <i>reason</i> research universities exist is because undergrad were willing to pay money to learn from people at the forefront of knowledge.  The problem isn't having (most) of those researchers teaching, it's that our society now wants to send 50% of people to college rather than the historical norm of order 1%.  The researchers are spread too thin, and the mixed bag of lecturers must necessarily pick up the slack.<p>If you correct for the fact that the best researchers have zero incentive to teach (i.e. by just selecting those researchers and lecturers who are internally motivated to teach regardless of incentives) the researchers are <i>way</i> better on average.<p>There's a place for great researchers who suck at teaching or are so great at research that teaching is a waste, e.g. the institute for advanced study.

They end up moving where schools are doing a better job, mainly because the culture of the region has parents and children who value their education. They get paid more, because the school wants to retain these better teachers, who do good jobs, rather than the assembly line college graduates who ended up in education as the ""default"" and just want the job security.<p>So now money can factor in, and these better teachers with proper facilities are being paid more, and have better maintained institutions to keep them hired, and since the region already has a pro-education culture in advance, it has wealthy people who pay higher property taxes to keep the school all the more well off.<p>And just equalizing the money doesn't kill off one half of the feedback loop - it just renders one neutral. Good teachers would still go where parents culturally want their children to learn and promote their educations rather than places where the parents, and by extension children, predominately don't like the education system and are hostile to it.<p>Fundamentally, the solution is that every child needs to simultaneously want to learn, more importantly learn something they can be passionate about and pursue as a career (besides basic human interaction like arithmetic, grammar, essential history, and things not taught in school like how to calculate taxes, essential law code, etc) while at the same time they are paired with educators who give them the one on one engagement to keep them on track, who value their role as the builders of a future generation more than their guaranteed paychecks, and getting those two to pervasively penetrate culture is a much bigger problem than moving money around.",1364085574

5430509,comment,5430216,5430216,21,0,simonsarris,,,"I think this is a bad idea. Specifically:<p>> In the two examples above: When you upvote a comment, the computer thinks that the other comments you have read (the blue ones) but did not upvote, are not terribly interesting.<p>If you upvote a comment as interesting and the not the ones leading up to it, then you are punishing that comment because you're punishing its predecessors in the threaded chain, so it will be less-seen <i>because</i> you upvoted it.<p>Any other assumptions of which comments are read will probably not end well. Some people may skip to comments to get someone's personal opinion, other people may only read shorter comments.<p>~~~<p>It's worth noting that HN has an interesting algorithm that does not exactly sort by comment score. I have a very high average karma, and when I post on a topic, even if the topic already have 60 comments, my comment <i>begins</i> at the top and <i>stays there even if I'm not upvoted.</i> I suspect that the sorting algorithm is doing something like implicitly adding average karma to the karma of each post when determining order. Therefore it doesn't sort by ""best"", but by ""well regarded"".<p>This is good and bad. It's good because if a person who usually makes high quality comments comes along late to the game, their voice will be heard. It's bad because it creates its own rich-get-richer problem.<p>I think a better solution to the problem is to simply:<p>1) Hide upvote numbers like HN is already doing[1]<p>2) Dither the comments between ""new"" and ""well regarded"". First comment is the newest, second is the most well regarded, third comment is the next newest, etc. Perhaps randomize which category comes first.<p>~~~<p>[1] Of course hiding upvote numbers has its own major problem because sometimes the hard number of ""I agree"" upvotes is important. When you want to ""Ask HN"", say, what particular frameworks people can vouch for, you have no real way of evaluating the comment responses in terms of people that agree. Since they aren't even sorted from best to worst, the information you have is somewhat dim. This could be remedied by giving submitters the ability to turn on comment scores for only their thread.

5430475,comment,5429651,5430138,16,0,bokonist,,,"Hmm, I think the problem is slightly different.<p>The job of a tenured professor in 1980 was pretty sweet.  Upper middle class salary, great job security, a soap box from which to influence impressionable minds, freedom to pursue intellectual interests, etc.  Naturally, as with any career track that looks pretty sweet, people rush to enter the field.  Thus the great numbers of grad students.<p>There are basically three ways a guild profession can react to an influx of new demand: a) lower the salary and benefits of the master guildsmen to make the profession less desirable and to allow more overall hiring, until supply and demand balance out.  b) make the entrance requirements more and more onerous in order to restrict entry c) use a lottery system.<p>Option a) is out of the question because it hurts the powerful senior professors who run the existing system.<p>Option b) is the path the universities took.  Earning tenture requires more years in grad school, more years as a junior professor, and more risk of never reaching the goal.  And the actual research requires mastering extremely esoteric readings and/or mathematical techniques that have virtually no use for actually doing productive research.  But requiring mastery of these techniques simply became the default filter.  When you have too many grad students, the default is to make the tests harder until you have sufficiently reduced the number who can pass.  They then become the new professors, and thus have an inordinate love and respect for the esoteric test material that allowed them to get their current job.  The result is the death spiral you describe - burnt out professors who are out of touch with reality.<p>Option c) a lottery, is the route academia probably should have taken.  Set some sort of bar for admittance into grad school - great GRE's, great grades, and great recommendations, and then simply lottery off the spots.  Keep the spots few enough so that there is a clear path to a tenured professorship.<p>But the real underlying problem is that academia is not accountable.  Academia is suffering from the problems that plague any self-selected priesthood - over time its practices grow more esoteric and out of touch with reality.  There are a few good departments out there, but most departments neither do good teaching nor good research.<p>Unfortunately, the body that has the lawful right to regulate academy (Congress and State legislatures) are too dumb and too fickle to do the job well.  What ""reform"" happens takes the form of temper tantrums that do little to fix the system.<p>In the end, I think fixing academia is thus a ""regime change complete"" problem - ie. not possible in the American political system as it currently exists.",1364084866

You may not ""like"" the fact that teacher's unions are widespread in many countries which outrank the USA in education. Sometimes the American way of firing people is not the correct fix.<p>"" What would happen if teachers had to have advanced degrees and even some real world experience before being able to teach?""<p>Now that's something I agree with.

5430472,comment,5429824,5430383,5,0,_delirium,,,"I have met a number, but my experiences are more mixed.<p>There are some great outcomes, but mostly from children who were homeschooled because they had parents who were quite passionate about education. In many cases the parents were big on constructivist learning theory and able to set up a good environment that cultivates this kind of self-directed learning. My own parents were pretty into that, but rather than home-schooling me, sent me to a Montessori school when I was young, and then regular public schools when older, supplemented with some extracurricular stuff like museums and computers on weekends (in the '80s, Logo tied in very explicitly to constructivist education). That worked out ok, and I feel I benefited from having both the school and the home environments. But I can certainly believe homeschooling would've turned out ok, too.<p>Another large group (in the U.S.) and with a very different profile are kids who are homeschooled because their parents are very passionate about politics and/or religion. This could be any kind of politics (e.g. homeschooling anarchists), but in practice the largest group are conservative Christians convinced that the public schools are indoctrinating their kids with liberal secularism. That does not turn out as well, and often produces extremely sheltered kids who live in an odd kind of parallel universe where they read only things written specifically for Christian homeschoolers (there is an entire niche industry supporting this). They go to social events, too, but generally social events with other Christian homeschoolers. I've met a few of them, and they have pretty negative views on homeschooling, and many think it shouldn't have been legal. Admittedly I met mostly the ones who broke free of it around college by refusing to attend a Christian college (which would be the expected next step).<p>So I have pretty mixed opinions; I think homeschooling can work <i>if</i> the parents are quite open-minded, and actively encourage the kids to explore lots of new ideas, not necessarily only ideas the parents themselves like. But I think it can be quite unhealthy for kids not to have an outlet a few hours a day away from their parents, in the case where the parents are more controlling. A public school assigning something provides a nice excuse for students to read things their parents don't like because hey, it's for school.<p>I'm not sure how it would turn out if it were neither of those two cases, but just parents who felt they had to do it because the local schools sucked too much, rather than out of any special passion for homeschooling.",1364084769

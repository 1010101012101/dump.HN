Maybe he doesn't want that to be indexed on Google. There could be a variety of reasons. Anyways, IMHO deletion of one's account should be possible for every service for any reason.",1214545503

I'm just saying that the popular (wrong) ""wisdom"" is that ideas are worthless, and that's an example of a pre-post fallacy.<p>I'm talking about the guy above you who said ""I'm stunned by the # of people who are in the ""I have a brilliant idea and a couple of powerpoint slides!"" phase who expect to get funding.""  I may have replied to the wrong person!  I think I was more with the guy I replied to.

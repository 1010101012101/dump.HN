Aka venture fundable apps. Plus mainstream tech news so he can get interviews on CNN.<p>I go to mashable for ""weekend apps"".<p>Of course, they have a lot love affair with Twitter and Arringtons ego.<p>At $5/month per user is a very low margin thats only reaching a market based on another non-mainstream apps userbase. This would definitely be considered a side project that regardless of TC is not very ambitious or PR worthy.",1213156738

214574,comment,214314,214446,0,0,dkokelley,,,"<i>I think marketers rely on emotion a lot to sell...</i><p>They do. Especially with cars, but it can be seen in almost every imaginable product (both physical and technological).<p>Look at an Apple commercial. Let's take the Mac vs PC version. Of course points of pain (viruses) are brought up, but emotionally we connect to the feeling of ""victory"" over the PC when we have a Mac. And if we don't, we feel a sort of defeat. If we have a PC and we see our friend Mr. PC embarrassing himself because the Mac is so obviously better (as implied in the commercials. Your current opinions need not apply), we get hurt, even insulted. We can be defensive. We want to be on the ""winning"" side. It's our emotions that tell us ""we want to be cool, like the Mac."" So we buy a Mac. For most consumers, it's not the direct, logical comparison that causes us to buy. Those comparisons are justifications for our purchases. We've already decided what we will buy, now we need to justify it.",1213156079

Adding ""move/cut"" feature in 2009 will be a huge step forward. Or make iPhoto actually usable, so it will see and recognize JPEGs on your own file system without ""importing""? Or how about making Aperture just slow, as opposed to pathetically slow as it is right now? How about fixing Spaces to exclude icons of other desktops from Alt-Tab list? How about making the whole thing to feel like it's been made for non-retards?<p>Catch up to <i>freaking Gnome</i> first, dammit.

Over half of Techcrunch-covered ""businesses"" are not even that: useless weekend projects without use nor future. By the way, I got an email from a co-worker today about Mailmanagr with subject ""Check this out, it's pretty cool"".<p>Last time I got an email like that was about Google's ""Street View"" feature.<p>P.S.

Ask about the company's strategic direction and where they want to be in 6 months/year/5 years...<p>I had put in a couple of months at a startup of sorts (not tech related, but in 'green' real estate development) doing sales and biz dev work. I left because the founder wasn't putting his all into it and the company began to suffer. He had other business interests and obligations that prevented him from making this company his primary focus. The experience taught me that leadership and strategic planning/execution are extremely important. It can become frustrating if you don't agree with the way your employer makes decisions, especially if you come from a business background.<p>In short, make sure the people you're working for know what they're doing.",1213154888

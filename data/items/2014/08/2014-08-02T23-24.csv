The author seems to think the only way to manage many different plugins is to split them into different repos: &quot;If you have e.g. 100 plugins, you should have 100 repos.&quot;<p>Many times, 1 repo works perfectly fine for 100 plugins. As for wanting to only work with a subset of the files, the way git wants you to do that is to branch and change the subset you want to change (someone else has already pointed that out too here in the comments). What to split into how many repos is often a very subjective call, and depends on team, respository size, and workflow.<p>A real-world example where 1 repo works perfectly fine is the Linux kernel. Within one repo, you have all sorts of drivers for all sorts of hardware, and you have arch-specific support for a dizzying amount of processors and variants. The repo takes a while to clone the first time since it&#x27;s kind of big, but thereafter works perfectly fine as you whizz between branches and jump between tags.<p>On some level, I understand the author&#x27;s frustration with git, since it&#x27;s quite a paradigm shift from centralized repos like Subversion. I made that shift myself once, and at first I didn&#x27;t like being forced to play by git&#x27;s rules of the universe (or more correctly, the DVCS rules of the universe). I have come to deeply appreciate those new rules over time.<p>There are, in fact, valid criticisms of git. One that comes to mind is the complexity and amount of operations... looks like others have already commented on this sort of criticism.",1407023535

Where this still intersects with politics is when an ISP makes claims like that what its customers use the network for is itself causing problems, which really is a business problem--if all your customers are using Netflix and it&#x27;s choking your network, that&#x27;s not a technical problem per se--it&#x27;s a mismatch between the features your network offers and the features your network users desire to use.

ISPs were using tools like Sandvine to detect bittorrent traffic and throttle it down to unusably low speeds. The ostensible reason was that the Bittorrent protocol was using a ton of data transfer (that the customer thought they had bought, boo hoo) and that the packet storm was causing the performance of everything else to drop to shit quality (legitimate.)<p>I guess QoS could mean many things to many people, but in this example, I think it was techinically incorrect for them to say they were doing it for the performance of the network when they were dropping the speeds to far below what would have simply stopped the bufferbloat problem. They were mad because people were bittorrenting rather than just sending an email now and then and checking out a webpage.<p>So when I say FUD, I mean you can justify a lot of rotten shit to prop up your business and call it QoS. I may be wrong because this is not my area of expertise, but you can prioritize packets based on protocol in ways that keep your network working without engaging in draconian throttling and caps.

Remote position (ideally within Canada).<p>--- The Job ---------------------------------<p>We are looking for an experienced, effective senior developer who can take on a leadership role on our team. We have two established products - www.searchtempest.com and www.autotempest.com - but we also have a list of desired features a mile long, so we need your help to continue to delight our users, and hopefully pick up a few more along the way!<p>Your first major task will be to help us transition SearchTempest from a classic server-side application to a client-side MVC framework.  We expect to achieve a fairly dramatic improvement in perceived speed of the site by removing unnecessary processing on page load, and increasing parallelization.  However, this is only one task among many.  We are looking for a highly skilled and motivated developer who can help us continue to improve all aspects of our sites.<p>--- Skills & Requirements--------------------<p>You will need advanced knowledge of modern javascript frameworks - preferably Angular, but we would consider Ember or Backbone/Marionette if you make a strong case. Also PHP (we use the Symfony2 and Slim frameworks), and SQL. (“Advanced” means you should be comfortable personally leading architecture and development using these tools.)<p>Even more importantly, you must be comfortable (and ideally experienced) working on a remote team.  Working from your preferred environment, at your preferred times, can be great for productivity (and enjoyment!) - but only if you have exceptional self-motivation. You should also be effective at communicating via chat, email, and video-conferencing (Google Hangouts), and using a project tracking tool (we use Pivotal).<p>As a senior developer, you will be designing program architecture, writing specs for yourself and other developers to follow, and reviewing code, as well as hands-on coding.<p><i></i>High Priority Skills:<i></i><p><pre><code>    - Client-side MVC with AngularJS (or a comparable framework)\n    - Back-end development using PHP and a modern framework (ideally Symfony2)\n    - Database design and maintenance (MySQL/MariaDB). Familiar with concepts like \n      normalization, index selection, query optimization, caching, etc.\n    - Testable program design and unit testing\n</code></pre>\n<i></i>Nice to Have:<i></i><p><pre><code>    - Coffeescript, Twig, Handlebars, Compass/sass, Composer, Grunt\n    - Responsive design and development\n    - Experience testing with PHPUnit and Behat/Mink\n    - Experience working with APIs such as YQL, Google Maps, eBay, AWS, etc.\n</code></pre>\n<i></i>Bonus:<i></i><p><pre><code>    - Visual web design and/or graphics design\n    - App development for iOS and/or Android\n    - System Administration; shell scripting, familiarity with provisioning tools\n      such as Puppet and Chef\n</code></pre>\n--- About Us -------------------------------<p>We are a small web company based in Victoria, BC, Canada. Basically, we build handy little tools to make people&#x27;s lives a little bit easier. Our current sites are <a href=""http://www.searchtempest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.searchtempest.com</a>, and <a href=""http://www.autotempest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autotempest.com</a>. SearchTempest is a search engine for classifieds (which is actually more useful than it sounds!) Search multiple craigslist cities by distance from your location, plus eBay, Amazon, etc., without having to type in the same stuff over and over.<p>AutoTempest is a similar idea for used car shoppers; it lets you search all the top cars sites at once, with the results in one big list (optionally sorted by price, distance, etc.) If you&#x27;re serious about finding a good deal on a car, you&#x27;re searching all these sites anyway, so we save you most of the effort.<p>We believe in a flexible, results-driven work environment. We all work from home, using the tools we choose, at the times we feel most productive. We keep in sync with Pivotal Tracker, XMPP chat, BitBucket, email, and occasional Google Hangouts meetings.<p>Everyone on our team has a significant role to play. Remote work and flexible hours mean we can each work when and where we prefer, but they also mean we have to be highly self-motivated and communicate effectively to be productive. It also helps when you really love what you do. We&#x27;re looking for others who share those attributes!",1407021635

Virtru tries to make it as easy as possible to send encrypted email. We do this by integrating with your existing email client (eg, Gmail) so that you can send encrypted email from your existing email address with the tools that you are already familiar with. All you have to do is click a switch to turn the security on and then compose your email as you normally would.<p>One reason that some consider email inherently insecure is that the metadata (to/cc/bcc, subject line, etc) is not protected even when the message content (email body, attachments) is protected. It is critically important to define the term “secure”. One must understand both what they are trying to protect and why, and what the tools they are using actually do protect.<p>There are many use-cases in which the goal is to secure only the message content. For example, someone emailing their lawyer about a case, doctor about an appointment, or accountant about their tax filing. Also, consider a business sending sensitive intellectual property to its partners or even its own employees. In these examples, the sender may not care about protecting the fact that they communicated with the other party, but they certainly want the message content (personal, financial, sensitive, etc) secured so that it is shielded from prying eyes.<p>Obviously, there are many other use-cases where protecting the metadata may matter a great deal. In that case, one must consider their goals and make sure that the tool being used meets their criteria. If completely anonymous communication is the goal (protecting both who is talking to whom and what is being said), then email may not satisfy the requirements (certainly not in its current implementation).<p>I think that many would agree that email is here to stay for the foreseeable future. It is pervasive and the de-facto communication platform, especially in business settings. I think there is great value in individuals using tools which implement end-to-end encryption to increase the security of the emails they send so that the message content can only be read by the intended recipients. This protects the email both in transit (eg, routing from SMTP server to SMTP server) and at rest (eg, sitting in a user’s inbox on Yahoo’s server).<p>Do you think the general tech community appreciates the distinction between the degrees of “security”? Often, I hear the “all or nothing” mantra, which I think can impede the adoption of reasonable email security tools depending on the goals trying to be met. Thoughts?",1407021388

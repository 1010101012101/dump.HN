It usually only takes one or two generations.<p>One way of reducing the chance of this is to not split the inheritance. Even a vast fortune is reduced to below self-sustaining levels in just a couple of generations.<p>In my family I had a polish/Lithuanian aristocracy ancestor that owned some towns and large landholdings (he had some sort of wood monopoly). In three generations the families were still wealthy and in the aristocracy but were living off their title more than their wealth.<p>Another friend of mine&#x27;s family from India who&#x27;s grandfather was some sort of king has been splitting their lands up each generation. They recently sold off the las of their lands that had the ancestral home, a couple of forts and temples, etc and now are all just living pretty mundane suburban lives.",1427270373

Modern CCen just aren&#x27;t capable of this.<p>Haven&#x27;t needed it in a long time, but back when I did generating one for me was all of running the compiler with &quot;-MD&quot; in the compile phase, and including it in the Makefile - no special &quot;make depend&quot; phase, no noticeable slowdown. What technical debt are you ref<p>> Yes. They are both don&#x27;t provide significantly better correctness guarantees combined with sufficiently better performance to justify the cost to porting to older Unixen.<p>Interesting. It is my experience that redo (from apenwarr) is trivial to run and use anywhere there&#x27;s Python and isn&#x27;t Windows -- it&#x27;s almost as fast as Make, and it makes correctness guarantees that Make cannot (e.g., .o file replacement is atomic).",1427270347

The &quot;new&quot; keyword is a residual from C++, where you actually had a choice. Is it possible that people don&#x27;t dismiss Python for Java because of the lack of &quot;new&quot;, but because its GC isn&#x27;t as good?<p>If we had an hypothetical IDE that used colors to transmit static analysis to the user, then we could categorise the keywords between &quot;this is something the IDE can infer&quot; and &quot;this is something the user should specify&quot;. Object allocation falls into the inferable (so rather than writing &quot;new&quot;, the IDE would highlight the expression in red); virtual is not inferable; delay is not inferable; tail calls are inferable, and can be shown in pink or whatever.<p>Anyway, TCE is an optimization: we can run more programs faster when we have it. When we don&#x27;t use tailrec, we still benefit from it as our program consumes less memory overall. The cost of tailcall elimination is purely <i>cognitive</i>, for people who learned the old C-like stack behaviour (but even C compilers handle TCE now.) If TCE/no-TCE matched the static/virtual and lazy/strict binary choice, then there would be situations were TCE has a negative impact on the code runtime.",1427269968

9261687,comment,9256152,9260764,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"I agree wholeheartedly with you. Not all manipulation is evil. In this case the argument is that this specific class of manipulation is not altruistic. Cui bono? It&#x27;s not the consumer.<p>I don&#x27;t think I would agree with the universal that all market transactions are manipulative. But even if we granted that, it would come to your distinction: what kind of manipulation is it? Who benefits from the manipulation, and is anyone taken advantage of? Beyond the singular instance, does the sum of individual actions taken together constitute something good?<p>There&#x27;s theoretical instances where strong manipulation may benefit the manipulated (PT? Medicine?), but this too is a slippery slope towards a justification for paternalism. I&#x27;m sure that the business, in whatever form of cognitive dissonance it can muster, may think that the prospective consumer will benefit from its product. A great example of this are the people who sell healing water and crystals. What we want is for consumers to be informed and we want a healthy society (friends, family, neighbors, society) to encourage people to make choices that have clear indicators that they will benefit. We don&#x27;t want the crystal seller to be the one educating the consumer on crystals - just as we would rather have a person choose for themselves to get physical therapy than be coerced into it. (The difference between societal encouragement and education versus marketing is overtness, necessary in hypothesis for us to call it manipulative).<p>There&#x27;s also the other question you didn&#x27;t touch on. In the aggregate do we want a market system that competes on being better salesmen or one that competes on making better products and manufacturing them more affordably? Recognizing here that these are not mutually exclusive which do we want to be emphasized?<p>I don&#x27;t think that the above argument is grounded on the premise that all manipulation is evil. A more reasonable interpretation I think categorizes the type of manipulation being done in the instance, and the motivations for it, as being selfish and underhanded - the sort of thing we might think about condemning. Furthermore it suggests that the type of manipulation being done on a larger scale is not a healthy economy make.",1427269540

It adds extra work for downstream packagers having to pick it apart for distros.<p>Bundling gets particularly bloaty for git repos, since the history is always included in each clone. For perforce or SVN it doesn&#x27;t matter so much as you only get the latest version of everything. In git each time there&#x27;s a dependency update, it will pretty much add the size of the new jar to the .git directory. Over time it&#x27;s going to grow huge. If at a later date the repository owner decides on a new policy where the third party files are not bundled, then even removing the directory from the current head doesn&#x27;t shrink the repo size.<p>There are binaries in there for Mac, Linux and Windows (.exe file at least). You either need one or the other, not all at the same time.<p>This sort of thing is fine for proprietary software used in a controlled environment, but for open source it looks kludgy.<p>An alternative could be to have a &quot;dependencies&quot; repository that would be shallow-cloned as needed. At least that way the source code repo only would have source in it, not jars or executables. It&#x27;d ensure separation was enforced and you could still track requirements per version or change the policy later.",1427268423

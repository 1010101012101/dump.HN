Then, when seeing how pathetic zoo lions are compared to wild lions, we might conclude that they somehow lack the courage to live their wild lives of destiny.<p>The negative spin is that MegaCorp hackers are cowardly lions.

And this can be repeated up until it asymptotes off, which (from memory), with a 20% reserve requirement, would occur at $5000.  You can do the math on your own for a 10% reserve (I'm guessing it happens at $10,000, which minus the original $1000 is the author's $9,000).",1206243944

What kind of reserve requirements should there be for traditionally off-balance-sheet derivatives?  What kind of reporting requirements?  If I come up with a new kind of funding structure -- something like a CDO, a SIV, whatever -- do I need to explain everything to the Fed first before going ahead with it?  Who gets regulated: just the large non-depository investment banks? Smaller derivatives dealers and hedge funds?<p>I'm definitely sympathetic to the idea that regulators were asleep at the wheel.

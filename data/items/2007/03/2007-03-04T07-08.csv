2146,comment,2079,2079,0,0,pictperf,,,"My company recently went through layoffs and it seems that the only people who got canned were the ones who have been there for 15+ years. These layoffs didnt seem to be performance based. They seemed to be ""size of pay check"" based ( people who have been there longer obviously make more money that the newer people). I don't want to be the ""guy who got laid off"" in 10 years time ( I've been there for 6 yrs). I want to make enough money to be able to decide whether or not I have to work, and not be forced to be ""code monkey"" for a large company, that won't even bat an eyelid when its time for them to show me the door.

2139,comment,2079,2079,0,0,johnlongawa642,,,"I've spent the last two decades making other people rich. I've worked on cool stuff but been ordered to do dumb things. Yeah, I got patents and promotions but the time I spent preparing for them, or implementing DRM or copy protection could have been better spent making better products. I want to make myself rich this time (or at least a little better off) by focusing on something that someone really needs - not a fickle consumer, but a business customer who will pay to be able to do something faster or cheaper or with more precision, or to do something that wasn't previously possible. A month ago I walked and I'm not looking back.

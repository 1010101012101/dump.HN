Thinking back on when I was a 7th grader, I can say for certain that I was never interested in finding a cheap way to innovate, or that I lived in the center of the startup world. Maybe it was just me, but when I was in 7th grade, I was primarily interested in making millions of dollars. Why not mention that you can make tons of money being a hacker (visual: Pictures of successful young founders from Google, Yahoo, YouTube, etc)? There's nothing wrong with that. =)  <p>Of course, now that I'm older money is not the reason I enjoy hacking. But it definitely helped me get into it when I was younger.

I'm a fairly boring user who uses the command line interface and doesn't do anything very tricky. I'm enthusiastically using git for all my new stuff.<p>I definitely think all open source projects should move to distributed revision control, like git, so the commit access problem is eliminated.

The programming challenges are relatively trivial next to the total work involved. I'll believe he's serious about this project if he sticks with it after most of the fun technical challenges are solved.

34693,comment,34576,34690,0,0,mynameishere,,,"True enough. My problem is the oh-you're-such-a-genius vibe I get from the comments there. It's just something I've noticed time and time again throughout my life--people judge based almost entirely on perceived authority, reputation, and past performance. Oddly, it's something that seems to get worse as IQ levels rise.<p>Now, he's smart enough to pay attention to--I won't fault anyone for that--but when he comes up with an idea that was started by PG (project gutenberg) in 1971 (!) it just ain't a work of genius.",1184652581

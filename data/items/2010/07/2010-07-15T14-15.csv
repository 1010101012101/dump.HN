For one thing, just holding currency is pretty much a guaranteed way to lose money, given inflation. And I always understood gold to be a sort of hedge against currency failure, war, and that kind of thing---which makes it odd to keep just as much currency as gold.<p>Non-expert investors should basically just buy index funds and hold them, transitioning them slowly to less volatile bonds as they get older and are more vulnerable to risk.",1279205683

Beer ads, Go Daddy and Evony banners are all equally skeevy in my book.<p>Axe is a bit more understandable-- their marketing premise is that their fragrance will make you more attractive to women (which, while most likely false, is at least on the verge of plausibility).<p>However, I really have to object when you lump the Old Spice Twitter/YouTube campaign in with that.  The fact that the actor in the Old Spice commercial was buff and topless was only a minor factor in the overall scheme of things.  With Go Daddy and Evony, if you remove the breasts, there's nothing much left.  With Old Spice, there was still a whole lot of  win.<p>As for point (ii): it's been well over a decade since I've been to a trade show, but back in the day, there was no pretense that the ""booth babes"" had any knowledge of (or interest in) the product.

Apple generally does a 10-3-1 design process - 10 different fully working prototypes are made and they let the designers go crazy. From that they further develop 3, then go with the best one. I've been in some of these meetings as an external contractor and no detail is left out - we made custom screws for them and did about 50 different design iterations for one application.<p>Surely they had different antenna designs in the process - internal and external. I think the pros outweighed the cons in the decision: Higher reception signal than any internal antenna and a dual use, high strength steel case exterior. The one caveat being that if you cover the lower left, the signal will drop a bit, 10-20dB max. I agree with that logic and as a consumer, if Apple offered both an internal and external antenna iPhone, I sure as hell would go with the external - iPhone 4 reception (unscientifically) is far better in my office than my old 3G and the steel won't dent or crack like 2 black plastic ones I returned.<p>Now putting glass on the back... the jury is still out on that one.",1279205519

These elements of a sales pitch are learned in the form of raw feedback with the client on the phone. You can learn a great deal about human nature talking to people and selling them things. As a matter of fact I find that learning human psychology from books, or basing decisions purely off of numbers to be the 'cold' method.<p>I think that the article itself is pointing out that cold calling is useful not simply for sales, but many other areas that will benefit your business. For example, strategic business partnerships, advertisers, public relations and surveying your customer base.<p>In my experience cold calling, the people who only care about price are the tough nuts to crack. They usually ask the question within the first call as a 'time saver' and this can usually be side stepped with a qualifying question. Some sales people even think that these types of clients are not worth time spent on them, but I think handling the price objection is essential to progressing in your skill as a sales person.<p>A few of the types of clients that prospecting uncovers that buy are clients who have a genuine need (easy to sell, sometimes hard to service), information gathering 'tire kickers' who are converted with the benefits, and personable people who prefer service to price that are converted to a sale with personal touches.",1279205227

But read to the end before you downvote :)<p>As a vendor, dealing with hacks, jailbreaks, and other such things is remarkably expensive. Consumers (not developers) wind up installing these things without understanding the implications of what they're doing. The OS breaks, the applications break, things go haywire, things go bad. The hardware vendor, the OS vendor, and the application vendor all take the blame and have to deal with the support costs. We get support e-mails all the time that can be traced to iOS jailbreak-induced issues.<p>It's a massive pain in the neck that, understandably, a vendor just doesn't want to deal with.<p>Moreover, as a consumer, it's incredibly wasteful to be spending so much time on trying to break into undocumented systems that the vendors just aren't interested in supporting.<p>Instead, I want to support vendors that provide more open platforms for a more premium price. It <i>costs</i> more to produce an open, supported platform, and I don't mind paying a little bit for an Android development phone that allows me to experiment with OS-level work, or something like the Ubiquity RouterStation Pro[0] as an alternative to consumer wireless routers. The advantage to me is that hacking the device is <i>supported</i> and I don't have to fight with a consumer manufacturer -- a company with very different priorities to my own -- to do it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ubnt.com/rspro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubnt.com/rspro</a>",1279203620

If I write (hello) and then a <hello> tag is introduced, I'm screwed.<p>* Parentheses are common in written English. It would be better to use [] {} or <>.<p>What you could do is substitute () for [] and use a : to introduce character data:<p><pre><code>    [font color=""red""
      [center:
        hello, world!
      ]
    ]

But people would be forgetting that all the time. Another option is significant newlines. That is, if a trimmed line doesn't start with a ""["", it is interpreted as character data:<p><pre><code>    [font color=""red""

        hello, world

To answer your question, though, he point I'm making is that no one knows the true value of an asset. That's why we have markets: to help us price them. Unless we have a better mechanism for pricing assets (anything, not just stocks), we should take the market price as close to fair.",1279202597

In this case, you <i>want</i> to search everyone on the bus that you don't trust until you are satisfied there is no bomb, but social pressures prevent you from doing so.  This causes the stress.<p>The difference just being acceptance. When you believe that someone may be carrying a bomb you hold onto some hope that <i>something</i> can be done to stop them. When you get on a bus knowing that there is the possibility of an accident, there's not much you can do short of wrestling for control of the bus from the driver (or just not getting on the bus).<p>People have <i>accepted</i> that accidents happen.

For a variety of complicated reasons, Japanese encoding, such as SHIFT-JIS, are not considered to losslessly encode into UTF-8. As a result, Ruby has a policy of not attempting to simply encode any inbound String into UTF-8.<p>> This decision is debatable, but the fact is that if Ruby transparently transcoded all content into UTF-8, a large portion of the Ruby community would see invisible lossy changes to their content. That part of the community is willing to put up with incompatible encoding exceptions because properly handling the encodings they regularly deal with is a somewhat manual process.<p>Does someone has any sources about this?<p>Esp, why is SHIFT-JIS important? Is Unicode not capable of encoding the full Japanese language? What information would you loose by encoding with Unicode?<p>And why can't Unicode be extended to encode this missing information?<p>This seems to be a much better solution than this encoding nightmare.

Freedom is more a set of associations than a strict definition, though I'm sure one can find philosophers who have attempted to strictly define it, so you get ""freedom sub Professor X"". Freedom is much easier to talk about in the abstract than to define, and lends itself to pithy (or, less charitably, glib) phrases that can be twisted to whatever one's own definition of freedom is.<p>My original post was flippant and lacking in nuance, to be sure (still not warranting the personal attack; I do, in fact, attempt to point out logical fallacies and bring about reasonable discourse).

1322901,comment,1321899,1322489,0,0,Groxx,,,"While running some errands, I think I realized the core of my trouble accepting this proof.  I think it may be the same for a lot of people, but I've never heard it stated, so here it is:<p>To my mind, it seems logical that if P reaches a paradox, it <i>never</i> returns.  It's an infinite logical loop, never finishing, thus never returning true or false.  Like evaluating ""this statement is false"", it's stuck on ""if it's true, it's false.  If false, true"".  To that end, the paradox isn't a paradox: it just never finishes.<p>If this is the case, then P(Q(Q)) does indeed escape the problem entirely: it shows that Q(Q) will never finish.  <i>That</i> argument I've made, and I've seen others make, but the realization of the previous paragraph is new.  And nobody I've debated this with has really attempted to look outside of ""but it's a <i>proof</i>, it <i>proves</i> it"", and re-iterating the steps of the proof.  Not that many have <i>tried</i> for very long, they usually get upset that I can't see the ""obvious"".  Thanks for sticking it out, I've had longer to think on this than I've had with others, and that may have been what I needed.<p>This reveals a missing assumption in the proof, or at least one I've never seen stated: that P <i>must</i> finish.  If it must finish, then I accept the proof completely.  If it's a paradox, I agree, it's a paradox, and it certainly is within that requirement.  It must return, but it cannot, therefore it can not exist.<p>But then I must ask: Why <i>must</i> P finish on all inputs?  I can make a program which doesn't (print(num) when passed Pi), why not this one?<p>I'd be very interested in any input / rebuttals to this.  I'm not trying to be difficult, honest!  I've understood the proof where P must finish for quite a while, but I don't see that it's a valid assumption if categorically stating that it's inherently un-doable.",1273099700

None have so far):<p>1. Ask questions about how a manager would handle a situation. If you're not being interviewed by your direct manager (why not?), ask what the company would do. Start off simple, ""I want to use a new technology that we don't already support but I believe will make a project easier/quicker/more profitable. What's your response?"" and work up to harder things ""We're pushing to a rapidly approaching hard release date and someone vital quits. The team is already at breaking point. There's no way we'll deliver. What do you do?""<p>2. Ask to see the working environment and sit down and talk with other employees of all kinds (programmers, designers, secretaries) without management present. Not for long, just 15 minutes. If they say no, it's a problem.<p>3. If you're expected to maintain and existing code base, ask for code examples. They often do it of you, it's only fair.

A lot of my peers who work at MS loved living in the city, but had to move out to the suburbs (that they don't really like) to save on commute. Which is the point - if MS was downtown it would be reasonably commutable by just about everyone (including suburbanites in Bellevue). The reverse (putting the office in the 'burbs) makes commuting slightly simpler for suburbanites at the cost of making it nigh impossible for urban dwellers.<p>Personally, having grown up in a sleepy suburb not at all unlike Kirkland, I'd loathe to go back - and I know a lot of my younger peers feel the same. This is on top of all of the requisite issues with suburban lifestyles (e.g., over-reliance on cars, health concerns due to driving everywhere, sprawl, walkability in general, social homogeneity, etc).<p>I currently live 20 minutes away from work by bus (plus side: I get to walk home on a good day, try doing that in the suburbs), and luckily my employer is reasonably close to downtown. That's less commute than most suburban office parks demand, and all of it is ""free time"" (i.e., I can be doing other things than watching the road).",1273098891

1322736,comment,1321440,1321897,0,0,lionhearted,,,"The rest of your post is really good Patrick, but I think the domains you chose for illustrative purposes is kind of unfortunate:<p>> This is largely because people don't come from China to major in Women's Studies, Philosophy, or Anthropology.<p>These are extremely different disciplines. First, anthropology has actually a lot of practical value, skilled anthropologists are decent at making predictions, or at the very least, raising interesting questions. The CIA's precusor, the Office of War Information had a lot of anthropologists on its staff and has roots in that sort of study, surveying, and analysis from different objective and subjective sources.<p>Philosophy is more of an an art, but a bit of training in philosophy can help a person resolve some important practical questions, and can help build character.<p>So those two are fields valid for different reasons. Anthropology can be watered down and yucky due to its subjective nature at times, but can be very valuable when trying to draw conclusions from a mix of objective and subjective data. For instance, trying to synergize census data and diary accounts to figure out what the quality of life was like in 1850's Prussia. And then making predictions about how a change in water supply, or military conscription could have ripple effects in a modern society based on Prussian data from 1850, Greek data from way back when, and so on.<p>Philosophy is what it is, and it's a legitimate field. People who are only philosophers and don't have training in other fields can sometimes ignore obvious practical considerations, but I think it's an incredibly good second or third field of study in concurrence with something else.<p>Which brings us to women's studies - which, from all of my experience, seems to be formalized, institutionalized political activism and not a legitimate field of study. They don't submit their views to review or analysis from anyone outside their field, and intentionally create so much lingo and jargon that it becomes very hard to discuss in practical language. It's kind of the opposite of physics - physicists are always trying to explain very complex systems as straightforwardly as possible, are open to hearing anyone's view who can provide falsifiable evidence, and it's a cause for celebration when the old view of physics is falsified and a new paradigm takes over. Women's studies is the opposite - they're trying to take fairly common situations and give them complex and obfuscating terminology, they're insulated and very poorly receive anyone's opinion that doesn't support their current worldview, and fight tooth and nail against anything that disputes their canon.<p>So, I fully agree with your comment, except that I think the three fields you chose were a little unfortunate. Philosophy can be valuable for people even when not directly relevant to careers. Anthropology has some bullshit involved with it at times, but can definitely be a solid field of study. Women's studies, though... I don't know, I don't want to see philosophy or anthropology get associated with that at all.<p>Maybe the most damning thing is that women's studies directly contradicts itself frequently and gets indignant when someone tries to reconcile it. Most egregiously - one of the major justifications and arguments for sexual reassignment surgery is that transgendered people have ""the other gender's brain pattern"" - something like that, you can look it up in greater detail. So that's taught in Gender Studies 317 or whatever, but in Gender Studies 201 they're saying gender is all a social construct and all gender roles are created by the media.<p>They don't want to get at correct worldviews, they want political power. If innate gender differences lends them political power - funding, access to services, favorable laws, new members of their political voting bloc - then there's innate gender differences. If ""gender is a social construct"" is good for political power - because it demonstrates oppression, justifies favorable laws, funding, and attracts new members to their political voting bloc - then gender is a social construct. And they let these two irreconcilable points of view live in the same building, and use whichever is convenient for the current argument!<p>So, I guess you could say ""one of these three is not like the other"" - Anthropology has some practical career applications even though it can be abstract. Philosophy is definitely a legitimate field of study, and can be very good for developing a person's character even if there isn't immediate career opportunities involved. Women's studies? Well, it's not politically correct to say, but a thorough examination makes it look like it's not particularly a valid or good field of study, that's shameful that universities allow it into the same halls where legitimate disciplines are taught and learned.",1273096938

At some point after N moves and a decade of my decor being dominated by bookshelves I decided I no longer needed to own every book I had ever read in my life.  I sold most of my text books on Amazon, except for my intro college science texts which I gave, along with most of my pop-sci books, to someone who worked with gifted high school students so he could pass them along.  Most of the rest of the books went to a local used bookstore, or to the library.  I kept my favorite books by my favorite authors; only the stuff I was sure I would reread.  And, it turns out, I don't miss any of the books I got rid of.",1266951419

It's rather short, as checkout is a one-form process with about 5 fields.<p>* E-mails me back that it doesn't work and I'm clearly discriminating against him for some reason.<p>* I reply with apologies and a screencast showing how to place an order.<p>* E-mails me back that his credit card was declined and I must be doing it on purpose. The mail to me is carbon copied to the White House and to the FBI.<p>* I e-mail him back that this is completely untrue, and his card was declined because the billing address provided wasn't correct according to his bank.<p>* He e-mails me back a week later telling me that he is going to ""bring suit under Federal child custody interference laws"" as my not accepting his order is harming his ""ability to provide for his son"". This mail is carbon copied to the White House and to Senator John McCain. I decide at this point to ignore the mail entirely.<p>* He forwards the same mail to me 6 times from multiple e-mail addresses, each time carbon copied to another government agency and random senators. I continue to ignore these mails.<p>* Two months later he sends a fresh set of e-mails, reiterating that he will have to sue me under some federal acts for failing to help his business, saying that ""this is a hate crime"" because it is ""only hate"" that I would not accept his order, and carbon copying the mail to USA TODAY's editor e-mail and some address I don't recognize @whitehouse.gov",1266951376
1146079,comment,1145593,1145725,0,0,lotharbot,,,"I have friends who have always been very conscious of the monetary cost of items, but seemed to think space is free (that is, ""hoarders"").  They very recently began a transition away from that, triggered partly by the local health department and partly by a worsening medical condition leading to full-time wheelchair use.  It's fascinating to see people who spent decades accumulating stuff suddenly getting rid of it and turning down new free stuff, all because their valuation of ""space"" changed.<p>One of the reasons simplicity is hard is that owning stuff has psychological connotations for everyone involved.  A digitial copy of your photograph or document ""in the cloud"" seems less permanent and less under your control than one on your hard drive, which itself seems less so than a physical copy -- and this perception is at least partly mistaken.  Those seeking control and ""certainty"" may still accumulate paper copies far beyond what is reasonable, all because they have a psychological desire to do so.<p>IMO, it all boils down to how we value space, time, money, effort/frustration, certainty/risk, efficiency, and a whole host of other factors -- and how accurately we understand those factors.  Remembering to account for ""a few feet of counterspace"" or ""a week getting stuff done"" are key to simple living.",1266951369
1146078,story,,,2,0,akikuchi,"Ask HN: What questions should a business ask an ASP before signing up?",,"There have been quite a few discussions around here about experiences with different hosting and SaaS providers, but I have a more general question: what sorts of diligence questions should a business ask an ASP or email hosting service before signing them up? I'm more curious about ASP and email hosting than managed hosting companies. So rather than questions relating to how their infrastructure and business will keep my server or slice running (managed hosting), I'm thinking about situations where the provider has a shiny package of software/services that they have built their systems to run. I'm curious what sorts of questions people would ask to get more comfort that they've got their bases covered.<p>I've found myself wondering about security, data integrity, backups, DR, etc. for a number of these firms, and I can't help but wonder if there are questions I should be asking that I've missed.

Don't work for free.<p>2) Treat customers with respect.  Try to understand why they are upset or angry or not being a good customer.

The second term in the sum is the L1 norm
of the parameter vector, and it has a special property of being non-differentiable at 0, and often causing individual components a_i to become exactly 0 during minimization, hence resulting in ""sparse"" solution vector.<p>Compressed sensing refers to the idea that when the image is sparse in the chosen basis {fi}, it's sufficient to take a small number of random measurements of the image. We can then compute ""fit"" approximately which gives us a different objective function that we minimize.

Two years ago we appeared to have discovered an exciting and enigmatic new predictor of success in a first programming course. We now report that after six experiments, involving more than 500 students at six institutions in three countries, the predictive effect of our test has failed to live up to that early promise.

One commenter (pedalpete) noted already that people gravitate high or low. But the larger issue is the number of people that will gravitate toward the current average rating.<p>This is a natural desire to conform, and it isn't always conscious. If a user perceives that most people have rated this item X, he will naturally want to rate it X, and will even re-evaluate his judgment based upon the ratings of others.<p>Of course, for an online-rating system with instant feedback, this gives the earliest ratings the highest weight, immediately skewing all the results which follow.<p>But what effect does the average rating have on a person who disagrees? They will naturally tend toward the opposite extreme. They want to make their disagreement obvious. If the average rating is high, the negative rater will gravitate toward the lowest ratings, when in fact he might have gone 2 or 3 stars had he had no such prior feedback.<p>This is a rather intractable problem, since about the only way to prevent this sort of feedback would be to hide the rating until the person has actually tried the item in question and rated it themselves.

Francis Bacon was right, <i>""Truth comes out of error more readily than out of confusion.""</i><p>Short version, they gave non-programmers a test before they had learned anything.  They found that people could be divided into those whose answers showed a consistent mental model, and those whose mental models from problem to problem were inconsistent.  A followup administration of the same test partway in the course showed that the consistent/inconsistent description was stable, but consistent people's mental models improved.  The distribution of scores for the final exam for the two groups looked like normal distributions with very different averages - most inconsistent thinkers failed while the consistent ones did ok.<p>When analyzed in more detail the final exam scores for the consistent thinkers had a bimodal distribution as well.  However the test provided offered insight as to how to distinguish the average consistent thinkers (averaging 60% on the final) with the high scoring ones (averaging 85%).  The sample sizes are small enough that I would not put too much weight on that observation though.<p>Amusingly people in the social sciences that they showed the results of the initial test to predicted that students who formed inconsistent mental models would do better because they tried to form the right model for each question.

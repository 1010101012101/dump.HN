4502451,comment,4500993,4501357,17,0,saurik,,,"So, I had both upvoted that guy's comment and flagged this entire thread (as in, the top-level post). To me, and I think to many other people, what is actually the core problem with HN is that it is being flooded with a ton of what is pretty much ""spam"": posts that are either repetitive (either to content from years ago, or even to content from last week) or content that are informing people of things that should be prerequisite knowledge.<p>In this case, the problem is that DNS is a distributed database, and the idea that people are hosting websites with all of their DNS from a single provider that is at the same time acting as their registrar (whose only purpose in the DNS infrastructure is to mediate your ability to change your DNS servers and renew your account) is horrific: it means something horrendously wrong has occurred in this community.<p>Meanwhile, the comments here are just strange: people talking about ""switching providers without downtime"" when the whole point of how DNS works is that you can have arbitrarily many servers and thereby have multiple providers hosting your zones at once. To even have a webpage in the first place you had to setup DNS, and if you somehow skipped that step then you probably skipped tons of other important steps. :(<p>Reading this entire thread is thereby just depressing: this isn't some advanced corner case of A/B testing leading to improved knowledge of how to do pricing, this is web hosting 101. Yet, somehow, we have 308 upvotes and 238 comments that have been left about an outage of a single provider for the only component in the entire stack of a website where you almost have to go out of your way to <i>not</i> have fault tolerance.<p>Then, as opposed to trying to get this discussion out of the way as soon as possible, we are just being flooded with a combination of people claiming that this is important, and that those who disagree are being ""snarky"", combined with opportunistic bloggers submitting tutorials like the ""GoDaddy Outage: How to Migrate to AWS Route 53"" that was just posted.<p>Therefore, I will claim that it isn't drivebyacct2 that is indicative of a loss of HN quality: it is instead that somehow any of this was relevant in the first place, and that once posted it keeps spreading. I can understand people being interested when AWS or Heroku or even GitHub goes offline, but no one on Hacker News should care if GoDaddy DNS goes offline.",1347313806

4502448,comment,4501983,4502253,18,0,smacktoward,,,"I work in and around politics, and in our business we have a term (lifted from the sports world) for this sort of behavior. It's called ""working the refs.""<p>An example: American politicians from the right are constantly complaining about the media being biased in favor of the left. Why? Because the calculus of whether or not to make such a complaint is pretty simple: complaining costs nothing if you're wrong, and if you're right you cause PR problems for the publication you're criticizing. So you make the complaint whenever you have even the slightest reason to do so.<p>Each complaint forces the publication to respond. (If they don't, you just scream louder about how they're so biased they won't even hear you out.) And each response creates tedious work, going back through old stories and checking them with a fine tooth comb for any hint of bias. This establishes a classic conditioning (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning</a>) cause-and-effect relationship: writing a story that the complainer won't like results in extra, redundant work.<p>Eventually the reporters -- the refs in the game of politics -- pick up (consciously or unconsciously) on the connection between the stimulus and the response, and start gravitating towards the less painful option: framing their coverage in ways that the complaining politician likes. Those stories yield no loud complaints, which means no need to go back and constantly defend yourself. So your reporting gets compromised without you even realizing it.<p>Marco and Gruber are working the refs here. If you're an Apple fan, it's in your interest for every review of every product even remotely similar to an Apple product to mention that, since doing so both positions the reviewed product as a cheap knock-off and reminds the reader that Apple exists and sells the ""real deal."" So they've picked this particular review and raised a stink about it. And it's already worked, because Topolsky felt the need to stop whatever other thing he was doing and write a response.<p>But that's not the real goal of the working-the-refs strategy. The goal is that <i>next</i> time a review of an Apple-ish product crosses Topolsky's desk, he'll ask himself: does this review sufficiently do justice to Apple's competing product? And if it doesn't, is it easier to go through another big public fight defending the story, or to just kick it back to the writer with an editor's note to add a sentence mentioning Apple's offering?<p>Now go through that thought process enough times and the writers (who don't want to be constantly rewriting their stuff) get the message and just start inserting the sentence on their own. Mission accomplished: the refs have been worked.",1347313798

4502443,comment,4501983,4501983,1,0,greedo,,,"In another life I wrote numerous reviews of hardware and software for national magazines. It's a tough beat; if you don't get gear early, your article is too late and gets lost in the crowd. Articles are planned months in advance, so getting stuff lined up from vendors takes a lot of time, and having a good relationship with both vendors and their PR firms is essential to keeping your editor happy. The workflow just required so much lead time between getting the hardware/software, interviewing interesting people, writing the article, creating images, working with copy editors etc. Time is money, and relevancy is always paramount.<p>Ethically, things have changed a lot. Apple used to be extremely generous with hardware, but as they became more successful (roughly around 2004-2005) they were much slower in answering requests for editorial ""loaners."" The print industry changed a bit too, and it was unusual to be allowed to keep review gear. So ""freebies"" aren't acceptable anymore, nor should they be.<p>Editorial direction is where things can get crazy. I was writing for one publication, and in a review of SMB firewalls, I was told to include one make that was clearly not up to the standard of the three units in the review. I included an honest evaluation, and discovered that this manufacturer was an advertiser in the publication. Later on, review units were always specified in advance, and the publication quickly became a trade/advertisement journal instead of one with honest, critical reviews.<p>Online pubs have it worse.

Simply sign up with a new DNS provider. They will give you their DNS servers which you need to set as the DNS servers that are authoritative for your domain.  Then sign into your registrar and change the authoritative DNS servers for your domain. There will be a propagation delay but once it's done you're all set.<p>If you are in the extremely common situation of having registered your domain through GoDaddy and also use their DNS service, then you have a problem because to move to another DNS provider you need to sign into GoDaddy.com to make the change I've described above i.e. change which DNS provider is authoritative for your domain. You can't do this until GoDaddy.com is back online. So what I suggest is that you sign up for a new DNS provider and then keep checking GoDaddy.com.

Here are the highlights, with the most important quote at the end.<p><i>One of the assignments in the
Algorithms course was a major term project in which we were to
implement and optimize the Fast Multiplication algorithm.  Fast
Multiplication is a recursive ""divide-and-conquer"" algorithm for
multiplying two numbers, especially large numbers: hundreds or
thousands of digits.Part of our grade for this project was based on how fast the program
ran.</i><p><i>What I noticed was that each of those
three recursive calls had nearly the same control context.  In a
simple-minded implementation in C, that context would be saved and
restored three times, being destroyed after the return of each call.
I thought to myself: If only I had explicit control over the flow of
my program, I could speed it up significantly by creating that context
only once and using it three times, destroying it only after the
return of the third recursive call.  Function calls are so costly!
But I would never want to attempt such a thing from scratch in C.</i><p><i>Furthermore, I could start with a simpler, more naive program and
basically DERIVE the sophisticated one through a series of
correctness-preserving program transformations.  This is where Scheme
really won.  Because of its extremely algorithmic---almost
mathematical---nature, Scheme can be easily manipulated in a sort of
algebraic style.  One can follow a series of rewrite rules (just about
blindly) to transform a program into another form with some desirable
property.  This was exactly what I needed.</i><p><i>I had never had the courage to
use a ""goto"" in C before; it was just too dangerous a tool.  It was
kind of fun to use them now, knowing that I was completely safe in
doing so.  That was the amazing part: I had PRODUCED a program that I
could not have WRITTEN, and would not have wanted to write directly,
for that matter.</i><p><i>""But does it run
fast?""  Speed was, after all, my main goal.  The answer is a very
resounding ""Yes!""  Out of a class of about 15 students, only one
person beat me (and only barely), and he wrote significant portions of
his program directly in Assembly Language.</i><p><i>Real efficiency comes from elegant solutions, not
optimized programs.  Optimization is always just a few
correctness-preserving transformations away.</i><p>Lisp-like languages make correctness-preserving transformations <i>easy</i> with their homogeneous syntax and accompanying macros. It may be that a simple Java implementation of the GP's example would be faster, I'd like to see a benchmark too, but charged with the task of making each one faster relative to itself, I know I'd rather work with the Clojure code because it's easier to transform. Compared to this <a href=""http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2012/07/native-cc-like-performance-for-java.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2012/07/native-cc-li...</a> on the problem of object serialization, getting really fast Java takes a lot of work whereas getting pretty fast Clojure takes a lot less work (if the parent post is to be considered a ""pretty fast"" implementation of the particular data processing problem).",1347312372

As a practical matter, you and I know that there's no way you can build a fully scalable, fully redundant infrastructure from the ground-up in your first week. Hell, if you ever build that kind of infrastructure at all, you'll be way ahead of most companies.<p>But, that's the kind of infrastructure you should be working towards building, all the time. You should have a clear roadmap for ensuring data integrity, then dealing with security, then dealing with redundancy, and finally high availability.<p>If your service falls over for any reason, ultimately it's because you haven't done something on your roadmap yet. There's no way to explain that to your customers that doesn't sound like you're trying to pass the fault on to someone else -- because that's exactly what you're doing.<p>So just 'fess up to your customers: ""one of the services that our business relies on had some serious technical problems that affected us today, but we recognize that ultimately it's our responsibility to make sure that our service is always available to you.

At the other end, you've got millions of exercise trackers and exercise videos fighting over scraps in the app store...<p>I don't know what the next big opportunity is in fitness - or I'd be doing that - but I'm pretty sure it's not apps or quantified self or stuff like that.

Also when I click Contact support at the bottom, the page gets dimmed out as if for a dialog, but I see no actual dialog anywhere. So somewhere in your JS code there is a bug that makes it fail in Opera.

4502262,comment,4499762,4501095,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"Reducing coupling and cutting down on code volume is also supposed to be one of the big wins for object-oriented programming.  Incidentally, the languages which I've found to do the best in this department are <i>both</i> object-oriented and functional.  This is because one facilitates reusing datatypes while encouraging coupling to operations, while the other facilitates operation reuse while encouraging coupling to datatypes[1].  Since it's desirable to minimize coupling in both respects, being able to choose the better tool for the job in a context-dependent manner rather convenient.<p>Incidentally, I find myself wondering why so many functional programming advocates nowadays seem to be caught up on the myths that object-oriented programming and functional programming are incompatible, or that object-oriented code is inherently messy and difficult to maintain.  It makes me wonder if there are a whole lot of people out there whose only experience with object-oriented programming is the way things tend to get done in C++ or something like that.<p>[1] This tension is described fairly well in Philip Wadler's essay <i>The Expression Problem</i>: <a href=""http://www.daimi.au.dk/~madst/tool/papers/expression.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daimi.au.dk/~madst/tool/papers/expression.txt</a>",1347311253

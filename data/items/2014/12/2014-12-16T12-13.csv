8756887,comment,8756736,8756736,0,0,alialkhatib,,,"I find myself comparing this to Pocket, which I tend to use to queue content for later in much the same way that it seems Snooze is made to support. What Pocket offers over this is a cleaned up page of text to read, but what Snooze seems to offer is bringing things back to the forefront automatically.<p>I&#x27;ve debated where to go from here in my thoughts, and I think the issue I&#x27;m struggling with is that the use cases seem different. When I think about &quot;snoozing&quot; something (e.g. Google Inbox, a conventional alarm clock, etc.) I find that the common denominator is that someone or something else is on the other side waiting on me. If nobody was expecting me in lab, I&#x27;d come in whenever I woke up naturally (and I do). Similarly, I snooze an email in Inbox (when I do) because someone&#x27;s on the other end waiting (with some variable amount of urgency) for my reply. A silent &quot;deal with these later&quot; folder would become a black hole, or at least would have a molasses-slow turnaround time.<p>Given this preconception, I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that &quot;snoozing&quot; is the right solution to the problem I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re trying to solve (ie trying to help people keep track of and get through all the cool stuff they see on the Internet, right?). Instead, you kind of want to find the gaps in people&#x27;s time and fill it with the right article for that stretch of time (which is difficult to do for myriad reasons).<p>I think something along these lines that would be interesting would be an extension that prompted you to catch up on your queue after a few minutes of browsing unproductive sites (e.g. Facebook, HN, Youtube). Even better, if the user could give it a list of sites and say &quot;if I&#x27;m browsing any of these sites for more than 5 minutes, please remind me that I have a queue of webpages I wanted to read.&quot;<p>These are just initial thoughts, and I apologize if it&#x27;s overly critical. I like the idea, and there&#x27;s a lot of potential here. It&#x27;s also entirely possible I&#x27;m just flat out wrong (and if someone has different experiences or insights that conflict with mine, I&#x27;d love to hear it).",1418734705

Furthermore for every sprite change or tweak i feel like i have to go edit 5-10 x,y points in my code And in my css. Hit testing is also a pain with abs positioning.<p>Relative positioning: Easiest to work with, pita to animate because moving the object to abs positioning breaks the flow and moves evertying. also a pain because of things like jquery position() doesnt give you screenX/Y or is there a solution for that.<p>What best practices do you use for seting up the DOM to make life easier for animations?<p>Fwiw, I&#x27;m mostly doing UI animation similar to a desktop app, overlay sprites moving from one elem to another, dialogs sliding in and out, and fun things like bouncing drop down text.

IMHO, MapTheBanks should be enticing people to join to make it faster and easier to perform the kind of Palantir-like big data intelligence analysis upon relationships between entities that make it feasible to identify influences. Hoping to &quot;nail&quot; someone for their part in the crisis is interesting and looking to the past that cannot be changed.<p>More forward-looking is the following. Make it easy for the public to formulate queries and datamine against a structured dataset and unstructured data to accrete competing, evolving intelligence analysis models (that square off in prediction markets for rankings) of market entities (including individual executive participants).<p>This could be a far more powerful deterrent against activities that have bad optics than any regulatory framework. It can also drive a useful feedback mechanism to tell the regulators (via a mass of competing models all screaming for it) what objective data is needed to refine the models&#x27; predictive capabilities when backtesting revealed data in the aftermath of market failures like 2008.<p>OpenCorporates could get some funds by running the exchange services for the prediction markets, and/or setting a small fixed cut for supplying the platform to intelligence analyst teams that use the system for selling competitive intelligence analysis services to anyone who wants them to focus on a specific detail using their specific model (perhaps through metering API access to the data and processing instead of only GUI-level notebook-style access).",1418734048

And things kept being moved from one list to the other.<p>I think the most important take-away for me was how important careful planning is right at the start. As we got closer and closer to the deadline, the code got nastier and nastier. But I made sure we spent several hours just planning our design before even touching any code, and that the foundation was solid. It wasn&#x27;t until the final 6 hours or so that we had other entities animating on the screen.

Maybe you mean something like the Korean writing system: Hangul (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul</a>)?<p>For what I know, Hangul &quot;glyphs&quot; provide consistent encoding (see also: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featural_alphabet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featural_alphabet</a>).<p>In Japanese Kanji the &quot;elements&quot; (Radicals, or Bushu, see here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_%28Chinese_characters%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_%28Chinese_characters%2...</a>) do _often_ work as semantic indicators (see for example Radical 85: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_85"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_85</a> which usually implies some connection with water or other liquids) but the connection may be obscure, or even look random - as an example (among hundreds) see 淋 where the radical for water, followed by two &quot;tree&quot; radicals means: &quot;lonely, deserted, abandoned&quot;.",1418731513
8756752,comment,8754910,8756717,0,0,bsbechtel,,,"I agree with both of you, although I&#x27;m not surprised you were downvoted. A few additional points:<p>1) Money has diminishing returns in elections. Once you have flooded the system with campaign ads, get-out-the-vote volunteers, analytics teams, etc, additional money eventually stops buying additional votes.<p>2) The wealthiest donors in our country donate the maximum to all candidates in an election. This is not buying an election, it&#x27;s buying favors from whomever gets elected. There is a difference, and from what I understand of the type of campaign finance reform Mr. Lessig is advocating for, it fails to do anything to address this issue.<p>3) Democracy comes in all flavors, but IMHO the best is not the most democratic (gives the most people a voice), it&#x27;s the one that distributes power most evenly across a population. I firmly agree it&#x27;s the concentration of power, not the influence of money, that corrupts any system.",1418731507

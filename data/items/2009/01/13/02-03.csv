I can take a look at a screenshot capture and in the blink of an eye know it was rendered on a MS system.<p>I think one of Microsoft's biggest foibles has been its poor use of fonts, its stubbornness in rendering for modernized CSS, its stubbornness in rendering for modern everything.  I stopped caring what web pages look like in IE in about. .  oh, 2005.<p>Of course, Microsoft ""hates"" to render proper, modern CSS, so its no surprise that their web arm is so archaic.  Almost all of the design foibles mentioned in the article could be easily corrected if they were to let IE let CSS do that thing that it does best.",1231815337

That doesn't imply that they wouldn't have been happier with a more lispish syntax.<p>At the time that those decisions were made, LaTeX was pretty much the best alternative.

These people were deeply honest, they just hadn't seen all the perspectives and ramifications of what they were doing, or were a bit too positive. Good managers know this and use it productively - it is one of the primary functions of meetings.<p>This probably touches on one of the big differences between engineer types and business types - engineers think it's all about technology and business types think it's all about people. The truth is probably somewhere in between.<p>My point is that the communication you do in a meeting is very very different from the communication you get from e-mail. Psychologists have found that when you interact with people up to 90% of the communication is non-verbal. This means that the bandwidth of talking face-to-face is ten times as high as sending an e-mail.<p>There's a pretty interesting wikipedia entry on the subject: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-verbal_communication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-verbal_communication</a>",1231814985

What about the, few, independent journalists working out there.""<p>There's a difference between an independent journalist and a citizen journalist. The terms are not interchangeable.<p>Josh Marshall (TPM) is an independent journalist.  He is not a citizen journalist.  He does this for a living and lives off the fruit of it.  Arrington is not a citizen journalist either.  I agree that independent journalists (essentially, journalism startups) will become increasingly important.  But that's different from citizen journalism.<p>Furthermore, while many citizen journalists are independent, I would argue that many aren't.  What about the folks uploading to CNN's iReport?  They're working for the mainstream press.<p>-""I'm having a hard time seeing how you are rationalizing that news orgs like CNN or NBC are not comprised of iffy product placement and factual errors.""<p>There are instances of sketchy product placement and certainly factual errors in the mainstream press.<p>However, there are also mechanisms for dealing with these when they're exposed.  People lose their jobs.  Have their pay docked.  Get moved to other assignments.  Lose face with the public.  They also get sued...all the time.<p>Citizen Journalism, on the other hand, is, by definition, the wild west.<p>I am constantly underwhelmed by the stuff I read on blogs and on Twitter.  It's all marketing.  And it's often disguised as editorial.  Ever been to a ""tweet-up""?  The one's I've attended consisted of dozens of people talking about how to talk to people on twitter. Ugh.<p>The mainstream media screws up all the time.  But at least there's people there committed to NOT screwing up.<p>As per your last point...what are these ""better sources of news"" that you speak of?  I'm always interesting in finding new stuff to read.  If you've got some great links, please share them.<p>So I think we're on the same page regarding independent journalists.  We're only going to see more Talking Points Memo's and the like.<p>But I'm still very skeptical about citizen journalism as a tranformative force unto itself, based on months of watching the local scene here in Chicago. There are some great blogs here, but none that are really capable of carrying the torch for a newspaper if it went under.",1231814812

431526,comment,431285,431507,0,0,mindslight,,,"I don't know the ant specifics, but I'd surmise that one starts off thinking of a simple declarative format (we've got some targets, that depend on other targets, which is just a simple tree, and perhaps we can write various analysis tools later). Then of course as time goes on, it gets more general purpose language features (symbol bindings, conditionals, etc), and adopts an ever more procedural feel (especially in the case of a build system, which essentially all about mutating filesystem state). Since these features weren't designed from the start, you end up with rifts, such as between ant ""attributes"" and ""properties"", which don't really tax the ant gurus, just the casual users and newcomers.<p>Seems that it would be easier to write a build system as an embedded DSL in a general purpose language to begin with, and when further analysis tools wanted to be written, make the necessary changes (meanwhile old build scripts run just fine using the old library).<p>But then again, it's much easier to criticize with hindsight than to design a system that becomes popular.",1231813994

9078489,comment,9077733,9077902,0,0,x0x0,,,"tl;dr<p>Komodia is a company that makes an SSL hijacking product, as described on their site:<p><pre><code>   Our advanced SSL hijacker SDK is a brand new technology that allows you to 
   access data that was encrypted using SSL and perform on the fly SSL 
   decryption. The hijacker uses Komodia’s Redirector platform to allow you 
   easy access to the data and the ability to modify, redirect, block, and 
   record the data without triggering the target browser’s certification 
   warning. [1]
</code></pre>
A necessary feature of such a product appears to be the inclusion of the private SSL key in any product using their hijacking tech and the installation of komodia as a valid certificate in the OS certificate store.  Therefore, anyone who wants can buy a product using Komodia, extract the private SSL key, and MITM at will any computer infected with any product using Komodia software.<p>Any website protected by SSL where that SSL authority isn&#x27;t pinned by chrome (do other browsers have such tech?) is now trivially vulnerable to SSL hijacking by, eg, anyone in the same coffee shop or local network.  And, of course, between that user and their destination site.<p>The current kerfuffle is due to the fact that Lenovo was caught pre-installing Superfish, an adware/spyware product -- for the users benefit! -- that, in turn, installed the Komodia ssl hijacking toolkit and broke SSL on any such infected computer.<p>The race is now on for every goddamn script kiddie in the entire world to the bank accounts of any suckers that trusted Lenovo.  Go up to Seattle where windows laptops are more common, roll into a coffee shop, and I bet you can earn yourself some bank account logins.<p>ps -- this is a reason people buy macs.  You get a vanilla OS install; that&#x27;s currently only really available for Windows afaik from the Microsoft store.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.komodia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.komodia.com/</a>",1424397502

If you&#x27;re using a landline from the incumbent local exchange carrier, the probability of a local call going over voip is effectively almost zero. Likewise, for long distance carriers, AT&T, the ex-MCI networks Verizon owns, and the Sprint wireline long distance network (their mobile stuff goes over separate facilities; their long distance network, as well as most of the ex-MCI networks use a platform called the DMS-250, which is very much oriented to non-packet connectivity) generally don&#x27;t use voip trunks for national traffic. Also, there is no least cost routing operation like on most of the smaller carriers, so there&#x27;s no need to hit any sort of public network until it reaches the access tandem at your destination, at which point, it definitely isn&#x27;t exchanged in any sort of IP format.<p>Internationally, it depends on what carrier they interconnect with and what they want. Generally speaking, I think Verizon will use more IP-based routes (usually to more expensive countries) then the other two.<p>By contrast, landline service coming from the cable company generally does go over voip, but only within their internal network. For local and inbound calls, it&#x27;ll still hit some DSx trunks back to the phone network. 1+ long distance traffic, at least on Comcast, is definitely in IP format, and could very well even be hitting the public internet for least cost routing operations.",1424395556

9078350,comment,9075659,9076083,0,0,BuildTheRobots,,,"> If the &quot;simplistic&quot; male/female binary explains >99% of observations, there does not seem to be a strong case for describing biological sex as a &quot;spectrum&quot;...<p>I&#x27;d suggest that it all comes down to how we&#x27;re making those observations and what we&#x27;re then doing with the classifications we&#x27;ve derived.<p>Why are we trying to describe the idea of biological sex? If it&#x27;s for the sake of a scientific classification, then simplistic is a horrific idea. Biology by definition (in a modern world) is dealing with the small scale deviances and the nitty gritty. We&#x27;re 99% rat, but the differences are somewhat remarkable.<p>We&#x27;ve been observing the wrong thing for thousands of years. Your assertion is almost correct; 99% of the time the _outcome_ of observation might be male or female, but it doesn&#x27;t actually _explain_ anything. All it does is answer the question &quot;does it have a penis&quot;[1].<p>Which in 2015 has far less medical relevance than it did in centuries gone. &quot;Well Mr. Smith, she is of the weaker species, this little touch of the vapours is to be expected, of course.&quot; is a diagnosis heard less and less. We&#x27;re now increasingly diagnosing and categorizing conditions a genetic level, never-mind just what your second sex chromosome is. [2] From a technical point of view, it&#x27;s already far more complicated than male/female. Simplifying science to that degree does it a disservice.<p>The big problem with binary though is the way it permeates through culture, language society and even thought.<p>Essentially, at birth, we clumsily label and categorise people based on their sex organs and worse, refuse to officially acknowledge the grey area. It&#x27;s like asking someone with severe allergies if they want the shell fish or the peanuts. &quot;Oh I&#x27;m sure they would both kill you, Sir[3], but you will be eating one for your entrée&quot;<p>Put bluntly, I don&#x27;t effing understand why everyone is so interested in what I have down my pants? You&#x27;d think it&#x27;s entirely irrelevant except for some very specific circumstances, but instead we all have to publicly broadcast this binary allegiance all day every day. Everything. Pretty much every trivial form online makes me choose between &quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Mrs&quot;, &quot;Miss&quot; or &quot;Dr&quot;[4] and usually as a mandatory field and yet you really don&#x27;t need to know if I have a labia or not to be able to print my name and address and post me a parcel. It doesn&#x27;t need to announce this on my bus pass or in nearly every english pronoun.<p>Through childhood I repeatedly went through conversations along the lines of &quot;Which football team do you support?&quot; I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t watch football. &quot;That&#x27;s fine, but which team do you support?&quot;[5]. Not having an allegiance, even a lapsed one, is not an option.<p>By simplistically describing homosapien sex as binary it means anyone who doesn&#x27;t conform is left out. It&#x27;s not a legitimate option. Not viable, abnormal, mistakes, a freak of nature if you will. We&#x27;re essentially saying that these people are inhuman and unnatural, which is obviously untrue.<p>The UK has allowed people to change their legal gender for over 10 years now[6], which legitimises the idea that external observation and internal state might not be linked. Simplifying that disparity to a binary state though, does a great disservice to the human condition. It seems odd that it&#x27;s now legitimate not to identify as M||F but you&#x27;ve still got to identify as M||F.<p>&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Other&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; should be a completely legitimate answer in response to sex or gender. It needs it&#x27;s own category, it needs words to identify it and language to be able to describe it otherwise it&#x27;s not a real thing, it&#x27;s just anomalous.<p>And anyway, I&#x27;m disappointed; this is hacker news. Define it as either binary value or a boolean, but we should all be aware that as well as TRUE or FALSE, 0 or 1, variables can legitimately be undefined and it&#x27;s something you have to be capable of handling.<p>apologies for the rambling answer.<p>---------------
[1] Admittedly a bit glib, but ignoring the last 120 years of science this is probably the most distinct observation we&#x27;ve been able to make of a live subject. Talking points might include testis and eunuchs, the ability to give birth and the difference between sex, gender and gender stereotyping... oh, and sea horses.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/genetics/vgec/highereducation/topics/dnageneschromosomes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/genetics/vgec/highereducati...</a> vs <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system</a><p>[3] Penis<p>[4] which until rather too recently has basically meant &quot;penis&quot;, &quot;already owned by a penis&quot;, &quot;has no rights, available to be owned (warranty void if introduced to thinking)&quot; or &quot;even more respected penis&quot;.<p>[5] Feel free to make your own analogies; I recommend some of the misunderstandings between religion and atheism or the futility of voting for a political party you don&#x27;t like as starting points.<p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Recognition_Act_2004"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Recognition_Act_2004</a>",1424395219

The approach is not perfect (since the private key may get decrypted as the author did), but in general it would work effectively for kicking out third party software.<p>If the developer&#x27;s intention was to encrypt the data transferred through the public network, then he/she should have used TLS with server-side authentication, with optionally using clear-text credentials transmitted over the encrypted channel to authenticate the software (e.g. basic authentication over HTTPS).<p>If it gets proved that private information could be decrypted from data transmitted over the public network by using the recovered private key, then this would be an interesting case of misusing public-key cryptography.",1424394292

9078290,story,,,12,11,daaan,"Ask HN: Should I give up on a career in tech?",,"About me: Me and my friends grew up programming games in the 90s on a Mac SE. Went to college, still loved programming, majored in CS. Did well in CS, impressed professors. But now that I&#x27;m job hunting and interviewing with Harvard and Stanford grads, I&#x27;m a little embarrassed by the state school on my resume.<p>After school, joined Teach for America because it was competitive and I got accepted. I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to have on my resume. Ended up teaching for 4 years so I could get a clear credential (doesn&#x27;t expire), never really liked it that much, quit. Now I&#x27;m unemployed and I&#x27;ve been looking for a career in technology, my real passion.<p>No success and I&#x27;m about to give up and go back to teaching. I&#x27;ve applied for software dev positions at many companies and gotten 1 response. Bombed the interview. I applied for a few dev support positions and had strong initial interest, but everything fizzled out.<p>I don&#x27;t interview well. I&#x27;ve practiced a lot but when it comes down to it, I&#x27;m not a fast thinker and don&#x27;t like being judged. Never have. I&#x27;ve worked on many hobby projects over the years and my &quot;breakthrough ideas&quot; always come when I&#x27;m in the shower or walking the dog or laying in bed at night. Relaxed situations. I also used to think I was smart because I was always able to overcome problems in my own dev projects, but after my interview experiences I&#x27;m now filled with self-doubt. In the days and weeks leading up to interviews, I don&#x27;t sleep and have constant butterflies in my stomach -- I just obsessively study data structures and algorithms all day. And then when I bomb the interview, I get depressed for days. I just got an email from Apple to interview for a software dev role. Should I save myself the grief and turn it down? Should I go back to teaching?<p>tl;dr: love programming, really bad at interviews, considering turning down interview invite from Apple and going back to old career I didn&#x27;t like.",1424394168

Specially in a place like this with so many technology aware people.<p>Giving more choices for payment is good. Sellers are including more people that can pay for their services/products. If nobody buys anything with bitcoin they lose nothing and business goes as usual. Simple.<p>Please get out of your bubbles and think a little more if you can&#x27;t find scenarios where people would use Bitcoins rather than money. 
In my case If I start seeing more places accepting Bitcoins it&#x27;s only more probable that I&#x27;ll use it and put more money in my wallet for that.
I can remember of two places I could use Bitcoins right now: Humble Bundles and Namecheap. Given the choice and more sellers using it I will use that option more and more.<p>Some of the credit card scenarios people are talking is again US specific.
If I want to pay for something quick and simple online I have to get really out of my way to do it.
I don&#x27;t have credit cards and lots and lots of people don&#x27;t have them and avoid them. I don&#x27;t want to have one ever.
Currently for me to pay anything online I have to go to MBNet to create a virtual credit card for each purchase I want to do. That card is valid for one purchase only and for a single shop/seller. There&#x27;s another option where I can create a virtual card valid for one year but I can only use it in the same seller/shop. 
Only after that can I use all those payments systems on the internet. If I want to be protected with Paypal I have to add and remove a card each time I need to use it. So lately I just input the virtual credit card info where sellers ask in their forms and don&#x27;t even care about paypal or amazon or anything else.<p>Basically I don&#x27;t really have much of any kind of protection anyway doing all this work above comparing to the simple use case of having bitcoins and just directly giving you the money without caring anymore.
Plus I don&#x27;t have to keep looking at my credit card looking for any suspicious transaction that the seller could at any time issue to me. I give the money exactly that I want and I can just go with my life without thinking about it anymore.<p>And this is just my point of view. I can clearly imagine many people with very different reasons simply using Bitcoins if that option is available.<p>Now the only thing really missing is being able to implement a simple shop using Stripe from this side of the Atlantic :P.<p>Congratulations Stripe and keep the good work.",1424394153

1399161,comment,1398509,1398509,0,0,WillyF,,,"I agree that police abuse is a problem, and I also agree that laws like the ones mentioned in the article are an obscene violation of our liberties; however, I'm starting to see the problems that recording officers can cause. I was recently leaving North Avenue Beach after playing beach volleyball when a gang fight erupted. Hundreds of kids started mobbing each other and causing all kinds of mayhem. I got out of there quickly, so I don't know what exactly went down, but I do know that the day before there was an attack on joggers, fights, arrests, and even a shooting.<p>Here's a story mostly focused on what happened the day before I was there: <a href=""http://cbs2chicago.com/local/north.avenue.beach.2.1714897.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cbs2chicago.com/local/north.avenue.beach.2.1714897.ht...</a><p>There hasn't been a ton of news coverage about the recent problems at North Ave Beach beyond the article above, but I was able to find a few videos of the violence on YouTube like this one:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDd5-QfjDXM&has_verified=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDd5-QfjDXM&has_verified=...</a><p>It seems to me that the focus of the videos is more on how the cops are treating the criminals than what the criminals are doing (assaulting police officers and acting like idiots in the video above). A lot of comments on the Second City Cop blog - <a href=""http://secondcitycop.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://secondcitycop.blogspot.com</a> - have indicated that law enforcement officers in Chicago are becoming extremely hesitant to act because they are worried about how their actions may look on camera.<p>Yes, ""citizen journalists"" with cell phone cameras will help to curb police abuse, but they will also discourage use of force by police officers when it is justified. The video above isn't the best example since the cops do end up using force to restrain some of the perpetrators, but they do seem to show a decent amount of restraint. In the situation that I saw, the cops seemed wary of getting involved.<p>The situation that I witnessed opens up a number of other issues, but my point is that I want the people who are paid to protect me to be fully empowered to do what they need to do to quell situations like a massive gang fight on the beach.<p>I don't think that passing laws prohibiting citizens from recording on-duty officers is the right way to go about this, but I do think that citizens and the media need to be more understanding of the fact that sometimes it is necessary for cops to use force. A 30 second YouTube clip doesn't always tell the whole story, yet these types of videos can ruin an officer's career.<p>Social media is a great thing for Democracy. I think that recording police is a good thing. I just think that knee-jerk reactions to news that comes in bits and pieces can be extremely damaging to our society. Our law enforcement officers shouldn't be afraid of making the right decision because an edited video clip will make it look like abuse.",1275508622

Thank you, Mr. Graham. Simplicity in design truly is elegance, and I feel that--sometimes--too much flashy Web 2.0-related cruft tends to distract from the content (as the submitter points out). Certainly the Twitters and Facebooks of today and tomorrow have their uses, but I'm not so sure it's a good thing for society at large that we're moving toward content consumption limited to 140 characters. Worse, when one is so distracted by the interface of a site like Digg--as the submitter mentioned with regards to votes and such--does the visitor cross a dangerous threshold between actually reading/enjoying the content or does it spiral downwards into some sort of meta-evaluation for pseudo-rewards instead of a truly rewarding and educational experience? Me, I think I'll stay here. I don't read news to be entertained.<p>For me, reading HN truly is a great joy to experience, and I know a great deal of that is in the community you have created. Whenever I click on ""comments"" from an article, I've grown to expect that I'm going to read through a meaningful chain of conversations and am far less likely to encounter something unpleasant. Aesthetics aside (and these certainly play a significant part of why I like HN--the simplicity is an amazing breath of fresh air), one of the the more qualitative reasons I find HN so much more appealing is the community. It has been my experience that comments generally don't devolve into flamewars, and it is delightful to see that disagreements here remain respectful and substantive. Perhaps part of this is precisely because of the simplicity: Those who come here expecting to be entertained go elsewhere; those who come here to browse meaningful submissions stay and contribute.<p>I was (and still am, I suppose) a long time reader of Slashdot, but I could never quite get interested in Digg and its kin; they're all effectively modern tabloids with over-sensationalized submissions (this includes Slashdot). HN is an altogether different beast, and it wasn't until about a year ago when a friend of mine directed me to something posted here. I was greatly astounded at the time that, in 2008-2009, there would exist a site that doesn't hide itself behind flashy UIs and simply delivers raw content, bottled at the source. What a breath of fresh air! Make no mistake about it: HN is deceptive. What it might lack in fanciful (and, IMO, obnoxious) features, it more than makes up for in its submissions. When I come here, I know that I'll immediately have access to meaningful content--I won't be distracted by fluff.<p>My only regret with regards to HN is that I didn't seen the site sooner!<p>Once again, thank you Mr. Graham.<p>-- A short-time reader of HN who truly wishes he'd experienced it much earlier on!",1275507803

1399119,comment,1398654,1398903,0,0,h3h,,,"A necessary component of mass production is consistency. Like it or not, Rails has reached the masses of web developers and enforces its constraints and conventions to facilitate the production of new web applications. I empathize greatly with DHH when he talks about large apps and the need for conventions. The truth is that most web developers will never devote as much attention to URLs as some people think they should. Full stop.<p>With that in mind, stable conventions are of paramount importance if Rails is going to maintain its practicality when building large web applications. On the spectrum of poor conventions to good ones, Rails has been much closer to the idealistic end of pushing REST principles and the concept of resources over haphazard URLs and actions. We owe a debt to Rails and its designers for the abundance of REST in production today.<p>That said, I empathize infinitely with Adrian Holovaty. I love URLs and I want them to always be beautiful everywhere.  It's true that Rails gives less obvious control over URLs than Django or Sinatra, but it does so for the reasons mentioned above. There are probably small changes that could be made to make Rails more URL-aware for those of us who would like to craft every URL with loving adoration, but those changes absolutely must be compatible with the consistency already embodied in the Rails routing system. I haven't thought much about what those changes might look like, but I agree with DHH that the post above feels very hand-wavy in the proposal department.<p>Just remember that we URLophiles are a minority. Rails must work well for the majority and they will never care about URLs.",1275507647

That's talking about the carrier, though, not the action. Presumably that callback means something specify. Like completing an order or authorizing a credit card check. Modeling your domain deeper like that makes it easier to follow and understand. But if you're either unable, unwilling, or uninterested in expanding your domain like that, you can certainly also just map paypal_callback to a controller with a action that corresponds to that.<p>2) example.com/bingo-cards can certainly work well if you know you entire namespace in advance. This can be true for things like CMS'es, but it's rarely true for user account based applications. For example, if your product has a /help section that's supposed to do something specific and a user creates another entity called ""help"" you're in trouble.<p>The /categories part establishes a namespace. So you can have both /categories/wonderland and /tags/wonderland and they can peacefully co-exist.<p>The ID part doesn't have to be a number either, but again it comes back to namespacing. If you don't use unique identifiers, there can only be one thing named halloween and it has to refer to the same entity. When that's true, go ahead, knock yourself out. Lots of Rails application is having a taste of two worlds with ID including permas, like /users/5-sam -- that's nice for SEO and still you can have two Sams.<p>Hope that clears up the confusion.",1275505355

2549121,comment,2548399,2548399,10,0,tokenadult,,,"There have been some interesting comments here since I posted this article just before I took my son to his soccer tournament. Now that I'm back, I see some commenters have suggested that some of the occupations identified in the submitted article as probably not needing state licenses (as indeed they don't need in many states) do need licenses. Those suggestions by my fellow HN participants are often made on the basis of hypothetical examples or imagined worst cases.<p>My own sister has formal training in interior design from a baccalaureate program at a state university, and she has pursued that occupation since graduation for more than two decades. I am aware from my sister's work in commercial interior design in a big city with skyscraper office buildings that some interior designers have somewhat of an influence on the safety of public spaces. But it's ludicrous to think that Florida's pattern of regulation of interior designers is in any sense motivated by public safety concerns. If there are such huge public safety concerns from interior designers not being state licensed, why do we not hear news stories from other states with different patterns of regulation about all the people who die from entering buildings that are owned by owners who hired unlicensed interior designers?<p>The experiment in federalism that has been going on in the United States offers a wonderful comparative laboratory of policies. Unfortunately, for reasons well explored by public choice theory,<p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PublicChoice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PublicChoice.html</a><p>state legislatures often ignore the real-world experience of other states in setting policy, preferring instead to listen to rent-seeking<p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentSeeking.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentSeeking.html</a><p>lobbyists who divert attention from real-world experience to focus on hypothetical harms that could (maybe) happen if they don't obtain their favorite kind of special treatment. So I would respectfully suggest to my fellow HN participants that if someone wants to make a case that some occupation (e.g., hacking to build web-based SaaS businesses?) should be regulated by state-issued licenses, the persuasive way to make that case is to refer to detailed statistics about actual benefits or harms to the general population, rather than referring to imagination or common fears.<p>P.S. The one time I had to shop for a surgeon, for my wife, I asked my mom, an operating room nurse who has worked with some world-famous surgeons, to help me find the best doctors in town. That she was readily able to do. People always work the best network they can for the other people they care about most, and life will always be this way, regulation or no regulation. My wife had a completely uneventful and full recovery from her surgery.",1305425723

He is still very young.<p>Anyway, my point was, that place of birth plays no role in Germany. And, certainly the vice president must meet the same requirements as the president since he automatically takes over if something happens to the president. I think this true for most organizations, no?<p>I just forgot, that PG was English born. So this submission of mine was clearly bullshit. By the way I don't advocate that the US changes this law. I think there are plenty of good candidates anyway.",1305425530

It exists, it works, if you practise doing it you can get rid of some kinds of automatic fears which have been a deep set part of your life for decades, and you can do so in minutes. This is free, potentially life changing information. I would bet money that you wont even try it, and think it probable that you wont even take seriously the idea to try it and plan to do so ""one day"" and never do. That nobody who reads this will give it a second thought.<p>But if you'd paid good money to meet a consultant about some fear you have, and they told you about it, you would think hard about it, try it, and when you fail the first time, you would try again. And if you can't do it, you would try a different fear assuming it was you at fault not the idea. But if it's free, you're much more likely to try it once and if you can't get it to work first time on one fear, assume it's bunk.",1305425506

All these criticisms are still valid and can be extended with some added new stupidities (for example needing to explicitly specify capture in lambdas, a new and entirely unique way to shoot yourself in the foot; or user defined numeric literals which brings the joys of parsing C++ down the stack making even tokenizing it difficult).",1305425415

This would encourage and create skilled, smart, talented, and able individuals of any walk of life, compete with local businesses and other individuals for gigs, projects, jobs, and more. Something like that would balance the market and make it more efficient while giving everyone the opportunity to do the things they love and have a passion for. That is what we are working on.

2603670,comment,2602463,2602463,5,0,vicaya,,,"When I was just starting to play with Scala 5 years ago, I found a lot of stuff that's ""cool/neat/tight/convenient"", I've since watched the language grow into a monster that's trying too hard to be Java++. The xml embedding syntax that looked neat initially looks like an anachronism now.<p>The result is a Java++ that's worse than C++. It slows down compilation 10x and makes proper tooling (IDE support) 10x hard, while providing no performance advantages. In C++, you can often get nice abstraction idioms (mostly due to template (partial) specialization, SFINAE) with zero performance penalty.<p>Java folks should just enjoy the superb IDEs (not just 1 but 3) and look forward to Java 8 or something like that (pending the Oracle issues), which will have a reasonable closure implementation ((JSR-335 looks OK to me), which would make much of the user (vs library/framework writer) side verbosity go away.<p>People use Java because its stability, compatibility and ecosystem, so C# wouldn't be a viable choice for them but an interesting thing to watch and learn lessons from.",1306864741

2603658,comment,2602785,2603077,7,0,briggsbio,,,"It's difficult to assess the situation without having the WHO report or an inspection.<p>The long and short of it is YES. There are regulations regarding the quality and reproducibility of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes (the CMC - chemistry, manufacturing and controls portion of an IND/NDA) that go a long way to ensure the safety of patients here in the US. Yes, they can be expensive to comply with. But current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) regulations are a necessary component to not only protect patients, but also to ensure the validity of the clinical data collected. Without these controls, changes in formulation, lack of reproducible drug substance (Active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs), and finished drug products (including container-closure systems), there is no way to be sure what the patient is getting is equivalent to what was used to obtain approval (NDA/BLA/PMA/510k) or consistent across the marketplace.\nThere was a big push to get manufacturing and studies done ""on the cheap"" in India, China, SouthAmerica, and Eastern Europe. But over the past few years, many companies have pulled back development in these areas (unless they were planning to launch products in these regions) due to lack of oversight and poor quality of production and study conduct at clinical sites. And rightly so. \nIf the WHO conducted a thorough audit of his processes and found that they weren't up to par with the FDA or EMA(Europe's FDA) then we should all hope that any development in the US or Europe be conducted in accordance with OUR guidelines and regulations. The India trials could (and should) be used as a benchmark and built upon, but not relied upon out of hand without more diligence and reproducible results across multiple clinical studies (and in various ethnic populations, age groups, and other factors). \nThe inventor has a duty to obtain results using the most controlled and reproducible manner possible. For all of our sakes.",1306864555

In general, I think the domain does have an impact and I am working on some automatic demographic profiling technology. However, for a first-look, I think our general word dictionary covers an abundant set of terms that do not vary much between domains. For instance, your comment has the following anxiety-evoking words:<p>not, important, but, example, positive, used, hacker, negative, long, bag, but, away<p>Of all those words, only ""hacker"" would likely need to be adjusted for the HN domain. For a first look, we'll chalk that up to some minor added noise in the data.<p>EffectCheck does include the ability to automatically profile the document type (e.g., ""Press Release"" or ""Motivational Speech"") based on a training corpus. For example, most press releases have a high degree of confidence-- based on a corpus of press releases, we normalize the levels so that ""Very High"" on confidence for a press release requires much higher confidence elicited per-word than it would in a complaint letter.",1306864419

Ask for a in person meeting if they are local and if they aren't request a Skype call.  Many people respond to you attempting to create that personal relationship and showing that you care about your clients and work.

This is Ask Culture.<p>In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.<p>All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person -- and you obviously are -- then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and manipulated.<p>If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible, inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression.<p>Obviously she's an Ask and you're a Guess. (I'm a Guess too. Let me tell you, it's great for, say, reading nuanced and subtle novels; not so great for, say, dating and getting raises.)<p>Thing is, Guess behaviors only work among a subset of other Guess people -- ones who share a fairly specific set of expectations and signalling techniques. The farther you get from your own family and friends and subculture, the more you'll have to embrace Ask behavior.

They are more directly affected by pregnancy. They are the ones who would have to bear the child or to have an abortion. Abortions are not fun. Vacuuming your uterus is probably not a pleasant experience. Of course, I'm being somewhat flippant. I do think that women who have foresight and intelligence are responsible human beings who try to have children only when they want to. Of course, there are cultural and socioeconomic issues at play here. I""m not trying to suggest that men are not affected by children, but they don't need to bear the physical consequences. So birth control is more of an abstract conception for men. Although they bear the financial consequences...sometimes.<p>2. The idea that women are more responsible in general. Of course, this is a terrible and misguided stereotype. I know many irresponsible women (One similar to your story - she has two kids now.)If women seem more responsible, it's probably because society teaches women to be responsible and risk-averse from birth.<p>EDIT: for grammar and formatting.",1306863577

For the long answer, I'll refer you to the about page[1] for EffectCheck. For the short answer:<p>My co-founders are an AI PhD and a Clinical Psychology PhD. They spent three years curating a huge dictionary of words using a methodology similar to the Harvard Psychosocial Dictionary [2], but with the twist that they were focused on lexical impact of words. The dictionary is pretty accurate at measuring both impact and sentiment [3]. For example, we can predict Amazon reviews as being positive or negative, using the stars to validate if we are correct-- blog post on that coming soon.<p>Regarding context of the word usage: Both behavioral studies and fMRI scans have confirmed that context is not as important as one might believe. Our brains process multiple meanings of words in parallel, and the emotions associated with those words linger in our subconscious even after we know the correct context. Similarly, in cases of reviews and comments, people who use hostility-evoking words are often hostile themselves (angry people tend to make others angry) and the same is true of the other five fundamental emotions we measure.<p>Happy to answer more questions. Also happy to analyze any data that you would like to see in order to verify accuracy of the algorithm-- just give me a link or the text. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://effectcheck.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://effectcheck.com/about</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm</a><p>[3] Note that sentiment is correlated to impact only if the writer or speaker is writing without detailed attention to word choice. For example, political speech writers comb over every word to make sure they have the desired impact-- thus, the final text likely has little correlation to the sentiment of the orator.",1306861981

Likewise right now I'm not translating my native language into English, I just think and write in English.<p>I also experiment the same kind of frustration when I have to write something in a language I don't know well (be it Python or Russian). I don't know the vocabulary, I have to look up everything on the web all the time to find out what's the right way to express something. Some parts of the grammar seem backwards and you try to say things in one language the way you would say them in an other, and it ends up in a complete mess (and often, you blame the language, see that ""C is better than C++"" thread that was on the frontpage earlier).<p>That being said, it's pretty obvious that learning a programming language (even something as big as C++) is orders of magnitude simpler than learning a foreign language, so I would not say that knowing Python and Prolog is nearly comparable (or as big an achievement) to knowing Japanese and Arabic. On the other hand, we use programing languages to solve complex problems that always require some mental effort when speaking a language becomes completely natural once you're sufficiently fluent, so I suppose both may be beneficial to the brain in the long term.",1306861970

2603395,comment,2602737,2602737,11,0,jrockway,,,"This is way too much to remember.<p>The key to handling Unicode correctly is to think about the data that comes into your program and the data that leaves your program.  If it's text, it has some sort of encoding, and you need to decode those encoded characters before you can use them as text in your program.  Similarly, you can't just leak Perl's internal representation of characters to the world: you have to explicitly encode the characters to octets.<p>The problem that people run into is not knowing that you have to do this (in every programming language), and then deciding which encoding to use.  In some cases, it's easy: HTTP includes the encoding in the headers, so all you have to do is get the request, decode according to the headers, and you're set.  Similar, when you send an HTTP response to someone, just set the headers, encode the characters, and everything ends up 100% correct.<p>The problem comes when poor design causes you to assume the character encoding.  What encoding are file names on a random removable disk?  What encoding is this text file in?  What encoding are those database rows?  If you don't know, you simply can't process that data correctly as text.  But most people assume ""something will magically decide for me and it will all work out"".  Nope, it won't.  Don't rely on magic: be explicit.<p>The reason why things work most of the time is because you treat the data as binary: opaque, meaningless octets, that don't have semantics like ""make the first letter capital"".  This will work if your world is entirely UTF-8-encoded: UTF-8 filenames, UTF-8 files, UTF-8 source code, UTF-8 database results, etc.<p>The reason why people run into trouble with Perl and not with other languages, is because Perl assumes that when you treat binary data as text, you really have Latin-1 text.  It then says, ""hey, this is text"", upgrades it to Unicode, and then transforms it as such.  When your text was Latin-1 (the backcompat case), it all works.  When it's UTF-8, though, then you get double encoding: the dreaded """" instead of """".  But if you just tell perl, via Encode::decode_utf8, it will know that you actually have unicode text and not latin-1 text, and everything will work!<p>Anyway, the solution is to always specify the encoding via Encode::decode_utf8($str) or Encode::decode('my-encoding', $str) when reading data, and to Encode::encode_utf8 or Encode::encode when outputting data (even to the terminal!).  The hardest part is making sure your libraries do this (DBD::SQLite does, Catalyst does, LWP does), and making sure that your libraries have enough information to do it right.  HTTP is easy, there's a header.  But that blob in your database is not easy, and you may have to handle it yourself... because the information about the encoding exists only in your brain, not anywhere the computer can find it.<p>(Oh, and this only gets you to the ""I'm not trashing any information""\nstage.  If you want your Japanese text to sort      instead\nof in codepoint order, that's going to require a module.  Even simpler\ncases will require you to learn about collation and normalization.)<p>Edit: distilled the key points I raise here into an SO answer: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-perl-avoid-utf-8-by-default/6192088#6192088"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-p...</a>",1306861568

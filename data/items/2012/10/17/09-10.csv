Actually I'm the #5 on the Nib contributors list :p <a href=""https://github.com/visionmedia/nib/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/visionmedia/nib/graphs/contributors</a><p>But it also used to annoy me how much it was overlooked. Not for Sass so much, but LESS is horrible compared to either Sass or Stylus.<p>That being said, Stylus doesn't have the ability to extend selectors that don't appear in markup, the way @extend'ing %placeholders works in Sass. (Not that I blame TJ, the guy's awesome repo ratio is the best on github!)<p>The thing that gets me frustrated with both Stylus and Jade is that they go a bit too far in the minimal syntax direction at the cost of other syntax improvements (since going minimal means its harder to differentiate pieces). The Sass syntax is more than simple enough, and the option to drop semi-colons is a cool thought experiment, but not so useful in real scenarios.<p>And then there's momentum too. I mostly just wish that we could all get behind one pre-processor, and Sass is the one with the best momentum. (I say best, because LESS has some momentum, but it's syntax is way less thought through, and it has less active committers.) I don't blame TJ at all for this, but he definitely has less time to devote to Stylus than the multiple Sass contributors do. Mostly it's just a question of putting your chips with the player with the most momentum because that will bring you the fastest updates.",1350467012

4663740,comment,4662442,4663601,10,0,chrisacky,,,"The shutdown process is immediate. Everything just gets terminated. Redis flushes to EBS every so often. If the server running redis did die, then there would just be a ""service unavailability"" on services that depend on Redis. It's no major biggy... My nagios server would spot that the server died, and would fire off a new request with the preconfigured cloud-init script that tells the server what to install and then to mount the very same EBS volume to the server again. (You can do this using the ec2-* API command tools). I decided to use cloud-init scripts rather than Chef/Puppet.<p>Regarding uploads of images, because users uploads are saved directly to the ""uploads"" EBS volume which is shared using NFS, even if the instance is in the middle of an upload to S3, I will know that it failed because I could do a simple query to check my database to see when a job was started, and when it was finished. Whenever my files are ""syncronised"" to S3, I then set the file in the database to ""s3Synced=true"". (The reason why I don't upload directly to S3 using the new signature/CORS feature is that I have to generated 6 different dimensions of each uploaded image and then also watermark)<p>If the server running the single EBS dies (this is a single point of failure for me, but could easily be avoided if I wanted to run something like gluster or even two EBS volumes on different servers (which I don't )), then file uploads are suspended temporarily. It's a bit pointless accepting uploads because although I could store them on each server that received the request, the batch processing of resizing them and watermarkering is performed by gearman workers which run on a small cluster of a handful of micro servers.<p>If a server is in the middle of a transaction and dies, well then you're kinda screwed. I'd suggest that if you <i>know</i> that certain traffic must not drop for any reason, such as payment gateways etc, then you should route traffic through a reverse proxy to an on demand/reserved instance. You can do this in nginx effortlessly.<p>I'll write a blog post about the entire stack next month if people are genuinely interested.

Consider fa()->fx() and fb()->fx(), if fa()->fx() always is fast and you have a million such calls, but for some reason fb()->fx() is very slow, but you only have a few such calls, fx() will look like a very fast function without any performance problems, if you only look at pg_catalog.pg_stat_user_functions, but call_graph will reveal fx() being slow when called by the top-level function fb().<p>This is only relevant for systems always accessing the database through Stored Procedures though.",1350465349

4663688,comment,4660793,4660793,3,0,dataglam,,,"In my experience, 'creative coding' work opportunities happen in the follow ways:<p>- Personal connections are huge.  Agencies, especially those connected with advertising, are likely not tech-savvy enough to understand the specific contribution that you can bring to a project.  They will often rely on someone who already has rapport and knowledge of creative coding within their organization to recruit more talent.  Its to your advantage to know those people.<p>- Have presence in the community of your creative coding platform(s) of choice as an expert.  Answer question on the forums.  Teach workshops.  Write tutorials.  Or simply just share work.  To that end, you might be able to build rapport with the people mentioned in the first point.<p>- Create compelling projects using creative coding platforms, whether its a <i>useful</i> data visualization or just a thing of beauty.  It doesn't have to be a paid project.  Then promote the heck out of it.  Invite people to blog about it, critique it.  Absorb the critique.  Share the code on github.  A lot of work gets created in these communities that goes unnoticed because it doesn't get to the right channels.<p>- Build a compelling portfolio that non-tech/creative types can appreciate, but at the same time doesn't remove you of your hacker cred--it should be obvious that you coded this stuff in the written language that you use and the images that your present.  In grad school, you might have been able to present each project as fun or research, but now you need to shift the presentation in a way that offers value to the outside world.  Consider the practical applications of what you've created (even if practical had originally been the last thing on your mind) and list those (e.g. ""this kind of dynamic 3D data visualization could be used to visualize data x more effectively because..."" ).  The other option is to have a portfolio that only the creative coding community will appreciate.  But than it will be up to someone else to convince business-minded folks to work with you.<p>- It may be to your benefit to take a standard gig as an Engineer or Interaction Designer before attempting to do something like this professionally.  A creative coder who has engineering, graphic design, or interaction design professional experience can be a huge asset to a project.  It may also be an entry point for discussion with the people that you are working with, who may not really get what you are doing otherwise.  Also, you may choose to (or financially need to) do other work between these special projects, so doing something complimentary could be a good use of your time.<p>- It's important to keep coding.  Don't wait for paid projects to fall into your lap.  The people who do this well live and breath this stuff, and sometimes after a full days work on a commercial gig, go home and work on an art project project or even putting together their own library or framework.",1350464746

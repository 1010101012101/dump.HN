Sure, its great to share the things that our officers are finding, but at the same time, each time we find a dangerous item, the throughput is slowed down and a passenger that likely had no ill intent ends up with a citation or in some cases is even arrested. The passenger can face a penalty as high as $7,500.00. This is a friendly reminder to please leave these items at home. Just because we find a prohibited item on an individual does not mean they had bad intentions, that&#x27;s for the law enforcement officer to decide.

Cyclists were the first group in a generation to use roads and were the first to push for high-quality sealed surfaces and were the first to lobby for national funding and leadership for roads. Without cyclists, motorists wouldn&#x27;t have hit the ground running when it came to places to drive this new form of transport.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.roadswerenotbuiltforcars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roadswerenotbuiltforcars.com/</a>",1373399908

6014979,comment,6014473,6014473,2,0,NTDF,,,"I am a Georgia Tech alum. I had taken the Advanced OS class and High Performance Computer Architecture classes. My then roommate had taken the Networks class too.<p>I strongly recommend taking those classes, if you get the chance. The concepts they teach blew me away completely. These classes helped me make a conscious decision, to not be a regular programmer after I graduate. I wanted to be an engineer working on the hard stuff. For folks who have such motivation, these courses are amazing.<p>The professors are really great and love teaching. They will try to make the class fun (in nerdy ways). They are at the bleeding edge of research in their domains and know stuff inside out.<p>Beware:<p>- These classes are non-trivial. Most of these classes cannot be done without full focus. So, if you are employed full-time, please reconsider. You more than likely need to devote 3+ hours everyday to study.<p>- For example, Advanced OS class will require you to read 40+ research papers. You will actually have trick questions in mid-term and finals where you&#x27;ll need to know intricate details of each paper to answer them correctly<p>- Adding to the above point, the HPC class will have intensive math homework. There were problems to calculate IPC of a fake machine which took me 3 WHITEBOARDS to figure out the level of parallelism. If you have never taken a Computer Architecture class before, please re-consider.<p>- Georgia Tech, notoriously, grades everyone equally. Meaning, you will not get any benefits for not being on campus. If they end up grading you with on-campus students, rest assured you are already behind. Not to mention, students taking these courses are mostly PhDs. They know the stuff inside out already.<p>- Urban dictionary actually is very true in its definition of what this school is: <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=georgia%20tech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=georgia%20tec...</a><p>- The grading system is ruthless. You will either get an A or B or C or D. There are no +ves and -ves. A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0. In short, it is unacceptable to get even a B in all classes<p>- These classes are not like a regular Udacity or Coursera classes. You will not learn any programming in them. They expect you to know programming cold. The students who take these courses want to know how computers work and are highly motivated. See the top answer by a Georgia tech student: <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Computer-Science/How-do-computers-work-the-way-they-do-When-does-electricity-turn-into-software-And-how"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Computer-Science/How-do-computers-work...</a><p>All said, if you come out of this coursework unscathed, you&#x27;ll have a new-found appreciation for life and computers. I do not regret doing my Masters there.",1373399881

6014975,comment,6014971,6014971,3,0,cparmer,,,"The idea behind Plotly is: to build a platform where people can collaboratively graph, analyze, and share data. Two months ago we launched Plotly on HN (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5671831"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5671831</a>).<p>We received extremely helpful feedback, and are grateful to everyone who commented and used the product. Hearing from readers and new users was exciting, helpful, and insightful. So, thanks very much.<p>The #1 request was an API to generate plotly graphs from desktop environments. In response to that feedback, we are launching a new service so you can now send data from Python, MATLAB, R, and Arduino to your plotly account. Calls made with the API will return a link with a graph of your data, i.e. something like this: <a href=""https://plot.ly/~chris/421/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plot.ly/~chris/421/</a>. You can sign up through the API.<p>The graphs are interactive: click-drag to zoom, double-click to autoscale, shift-drag to pan, hover to view data points.<p>You can view the graphs inside plotly and style them with our GUI. For example, I sent data with the API to make this: <a href=""http://plot.ly/~chris/554/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plot.ly/~chris/554/</a> and then styled it inside plotly to create this: <a href=""https://plot.ly/~chris/653/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plot.ly/~chris/653/</a><p>HN: What do you think of the API? What else can we do to make Plotly a tool that you would realistically use every single day?",1373399817

6014972,comment,6013338,6013412,4,0,pekk,,,"A de facto surveillance state is created simply by the networking together of the companies which give you internet service, search service, serve all your pages, connect your VOIP calls, handle your transactions, analyse your purchases, collect health information on you, etc. And trade all your data among themselves freely. And startups are in the vanguard of all this data collection.<p>We lost when we allowed all this data to be concentrated together in this way. We let it happen because it was done by private industry rather than the government, which we wouldn&#x27;t have stood for. After we let that happen, government access to this data (by subpoena if nothing else) was a given. But even if we somehow forbade the government from using it tomorrow, it would still be accessible to these corporations and their political allies, with even less transparency and less accountability.<p>The public doesn&#x27;t know what private corporations are doing, because there is no transparency. If the public knew, it wouldn&#x27;t care what they are doing, because they are understood to have carte blanche under capitalism. Corporate obligations are supposedly exhausted by making profit or looking out for stockholders. And even if the public cared about corporate surveillance, there is really nothing they could do about it, because the corporation has a &#x27;right&#x27; to do almost whatever it wants as long as it has a strong income stream.<p>If you care about the surveillance and its abuse in itself, you have to go much deeper than sanctioning the NSA.",1373399806

6014969,comment,6012525,6012827,1,0,drawkbox,,,"I think to get maximum innovation on anything technology related, it should always be simple enough to get started at any level, then as you gain more experience you can (and the specs allow you to now -- AS2/EDIHTTP spec for one has encryption, compression, on top of HTTP/HTTPS - <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4130</a>) do more for performance, optimization etc otherwise it is premature optimization and a bit of a wall.<p>Like with gaming, each game should be simple to start but deeper to master.  That is what this layer is all about, lower down the OSI stack it is much more of a wall to beginners.  Never lock out beginners as they can be better masters with time, don&#x27;t hide the entrance to the labyrinth.  Leave things as approachable, but with better professional experience, modifiable to perform better.  We have all that now, a competing binary protocol will never see the innovation that a more simple one like HTTP will. Higher up the stack you can see how this was better for exchanging data in standard ways from old school binary blobs, to CSV files, to XML files, to JSON.  Same reason REST services won over SOAP, simplify... There is a JSON binary format BSON in mongo and also MessagePack but guess which one is used more in service/exchanging data the textual one or the binary ones?  The binary formats work well in certain situations where both endpoints are controlled by the same entity.<p>Binary and more locked down/optimized formats and messaging have their place but the start/base should always focus on simplicity over optimization.<p>The general rule in exchanging via standards is be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send.  Being all binary all the time is a backwards step and is conservative on what is accepted, I also think it would lead to a host of difficult to debug problems just based on work I did with AS2/HTTP RFC implementation one of them being streaming and of course encoding/decoding which can fill hours of work if you can&#x27;t visually see the content at some level.",1373399778

It&#x27;s a bit like if every website used a custom protocol instead of HTTP, and web browser vendors had to explicitly collaborate with each web site (or use the website&#x27;s SDK) in order to be able to retrieve content.<p>Imagine this: All the major players in the space (Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Skydrive, Sugarsync etc.) as well as app developers got together and came up with a standard way of doing this that makes it possible to use a single protocol & API for all online storage providers. I see this being a good thing for everyone - users can choose whatever service they want, app developers can easily provide their customers with a ton of options, and storage providers don&#x27;t have to explicitly produce their own SDK or court developers to do integration with their service. We did have WebDAV, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be widely adopted by any of the major players.<p>I&#x27;ve been facing this problem myself with my own app; it&#x27;s a lot of work to support all the major services and this is really just plumbing stuff that everyone would rather be taken care of so they can focus on the more important stuff. I had a meeting with Box recently where I proposed the idea of an open source framework for iOS which would provide a common native API that abstracts over all the different REST APIs used by different storage providers. The people I spoke to seemed quite open to the idea and agreed that it would be useful. I don&#x27;t think a library like this would necessary be considered a bad thing by any of the major players, as it evens out the playing field and makes it easy to support different services.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in taking part and/or using such an API in your iOS app, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on the matter.

6014922,comment,6008485,6010311,2,0,lightblade,,,"I think promises are easy to understand.<p>Lets start with the most basic element of a promise: the `then` method. It is so basic in fact, that the spec only covers on how this method should behave and nothing else. All the other functions that you see in the libraries (Q, whenjs, etc) just have a lot of combinator functions that&#x27;s built on top of the `then` method. Take the `Q.all` for example, it functions the same `then` except it wait for all promises passed into to it to finish before continuing with its own `then`. So understanding how the `then` behaves is essential to understanding promises.<p>IMO, the advantage of using promise is how composable it is. To achieve desired effect, you can take a few existing promise combinators, compose them together with just object/array literals and function calls.<p>For example, the other day I needed a html form to submit with a load mask covering the form while waiting for the submission to complete. The problem is that this submission can take anywhere from 21ms to 1500ms to complete. In order to achieve good UX, I needed the load mask to be not just a flash in the extremely fast case, but also not taking more than necessary time to complete in the extremely slow case. So I did this...<p>Q.all([ asyncFormSubmitReturnPromise(), Q.delay(500) ]).then(function() {
  // hide mask & other cleanup
})<p>For comparison, to achieve the same effect using asyncjs...<p>async.parallel([
  function(callback){
    asyncFormSubmit({
      success: callback
    })
  },
  function(callback){
    setTimeout(callback, 500)
  }
],
function(err, results){
  // hide mask and cleanup
})<p>I want to mention another advantage with promises: it creates an uniformed interface that disregards whether the loading is synchronous or asynchronous. Say for example you&#x27;re writing a select box widget that needs to populate the dropdown&#x27;s content. Your widget can expose a method just called `load` and it takes a promise. Now whoever is calling your `load` method will have the total freedom to pass in a promise&#x27;s already resolved or pending to be resolved. If you have the data at hand, it&#x27;s just as easy to wrap it in a promise `Q.resolve(data)` and pass it in.",1373399392

But let&#x27;s go ahead and assume that the security holes that <i>still plague applications today due to design flaws</i> are not the same as a couple off-by-one bugs decades ago.<p>5. By virtue of the algorithm, compression works better the more you have of the same thing. You won&#x27;t have 70KB of headers to compress at once; more like 400 bytes. The compression of individual header groups each time will not benefit from the previous data&#x27;s compression, as TLS or SPDY might do. The eventual overhead would not only be larger than a bitstream but take more CPU to decode.<p>6. Not only are they inefficient, they add complication to the parsing of the protocol, which is one more thing an application can mess up. Not only is it slower, it&#x27;s more prone to errors. A VPN does not fix that. Perhaps you should focus on real solutions to real problems versus quoting what decade network application programming began in.",1373399069

But also binary and fixed lengths lead to harder to stream situations, chunked problems and being less approachable which leads to less innovation I believe. I&#x27;d argue HTTP clients/servers are better at dealing with buffer overruns because it isn&#x27;t so set to a fixed length and more based on better defensive content messaging.<p>Many of the complaints on HTTP are really complaints about MIME messaging which the entire internet is really built on (standards anyways) and has ran pretty smoothly for a very long time.  Approaching improving HTTP by addendum like SPDY is a better idea. Or possibly transporting it better over streamed protocols like SCTP: <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6525"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6525</a> no need to modify the packaging/messaging format.<p>MIME/HTTP/HTTPS are very flexible and if you want binary can be added in and has been in multipart, EDI/HTTP/AS2 and other RFCs use this. Multipart isn&#x27;t used as much because it is more problematic (used heavily in email and custom protocols) so making the whole spec that way would be bad overall. The points on the OSI layers is very key, let&#x27;s not revert to binary + base64 everything just to get data across the wire.  You can put anything in there, basing it in text and human readable is always a good idea.  That is really what this whole layer is about.  Binary type of movement pushes us back to the days of non standard blobs, problems that http messaging then content as xml then json solved by standardizing readable exchange of data.  When you are exchanging data in a standard way it should be very basic to minimize problems not collude.  Throwing out all of MIME just to speed up HTTP when other protocols exist for any needs that are faster (real-time, attaching files, streaming etc) is a bad idea. Also changing support from HTTP < 1.0, to 1.0 to 1.1 had many problems, unless this adds considerable benefit, changing it adds more problems.",1373398813

This is mostly felt when you get more complex object graphs. If the GC only needs to run once when you finish your calculation, it only needs to sweep once. If ram is limited and the GC is forced to run 100 times, then it must sweep 100 times. This is a lot of extra work and is the main reason why GC can be slow.<p>In the case of HN, it sounds like you have more than enough RAM already, so you are not hitting the &#x27;worse case&#x27; of GC that gets hit often in javascript on last generation mobile phones. The symptoms to the user are very similar to &#x27;disk cache thrashing&#x27; and can be as bad as multiple second pauses.<p>You&#x27;re very correct in that increasing heap size too far is also a big problem, as running GC on 64GB of ram can take seconds - freezing up everything else while it runs. There are a number of guides on tuning the JVM on servers to avoid this. The new JVM GC algorithms are also very good at this situation by default, imo.<p>Finally, on the issue of RAM speed: phones generally have a fixed amount of space dedicated to RAM - the 2GB chip on my S4 is the same as a 512MB chip on an older iPhone. This generally means that it is just as fast to access the 2GB of ram on an S4 compared to the 512MB on older devices. So at least on mobile, RAM speed is fairly closely related to RAM performance.

So I&#x27;m not sure that this is really that big a problem. RAM is one of the areas where mobile devices really are improving rapidly<p>That&#x27;s not generally true. GC performance decreases with the number of objects that have to be collected. More objects (and real-life experience shows that as soon as there is more of a finite resource -- memory in this case -- users&#x27; demands will quickly lead to ti being depleted again) actually means worse performance, not more.<p>GC also depends heavily on the memory&#x27;s speed, and on the speed of the CPU-memory interface. If those remain constant (and, again, real-life experience shows that, while they don&#x27;t, they tend to get faster slower than the CPUs do), GC performance hits will actually become heavier with increased memory.<p>This is particularly important if you consider that you can&#x27;t actually <i>force</i> GC in most web environments. It&#x27;s up to the system to decide when it starts cleaning. If that&#x27;s done on a worst-case basis (i.e. postpone collection until the memory use becomes, or looks to be on a track of becoming dangerous), increasing the amount of memory won&#x27;t help for memory-intensive applications.",1373398561

I would really love to be able to handle my memory directly if possible, and while there are some things I can do related to object pooling, I lose control over that with closures and a more functional approach.<p>I guess to counter my own argument here I will say that for most resource intensive things like simulations (call them games if you will), an object-oriented approach does a better job of modeling than a functional one. Game loops, sprites, bullets flying around... go OOP... and then use an object pool and limit your use of closures. Is it a pain in the ass? You bet, but so is having to manage the heap on your own.<p>Now, as for the rest of the article, the author did a LOT to discredit himself insisting that JS performance will not increase over the next few years... dude, come on, winning isn&#x27;t as important as learning and discussing, and you&#x27;re clearly just trying to WIN an argument.<p>This article is not very balanced. It is basically just saying that all software written for a VM is stupid. That the concept of Garbage Collection is an abomination.<p>The truth is that VMs are incredibly successful and aren&#x27;t going anywhere. I mean, look at the rise of VPS! Now compiled C and even machine code aren&#x27;t running as fast as they could be! Run for the hills!<p>Performance is not the be-all, end-all of computing. We&#x27;re a social species and the reason that JS is the so successful has more to do with the fact that it is hosted in a VM based on open standards than anything else.<p>So why have we moved to virtualization? Because it makes a LOT of sense. It&#x27;s the same reason we invented compilers and higher-order languages in the first place... we&#x27;re human. We are the ones writing and reading source code... the machines don&#x27;t, they just blindly follow instructions. We choose to sacrifice speed for a more humanistic interaction with our machines, and that applies just as much to programmers as to the people who just use programs.<p>These are very early days for mobile computing.

6014769,comment,6013784,6013784,28,0,weland,,,"This is actually a very interesting post, and the first one of this level of documentation I&#x27;ve seen in a while. I also actually agree with most of the author&#x27;s points.<p>That being said, I think there&#x27;s a big elephant in the room: the additional layers of complexity. Much of the younger generation in the web development community seems very far removed from the principles of computer engineering, to the point that there&#x27;s a bunch of things you can hint at simply by common sense, yet they are opaque to them. For instance:<p>1. Performance hits aren&#x27;t only due to slower &quot;raw&quot; data processing, they can also occur due to data representation -- think about cache hits, for instance. Your average mobile application&#x27;s processing is more IO-bound than processor-bound. Unless you can guarantee that your data is being efficiently represented, you get a hit from that.<p>2. Since the applications are sandboxed, the amount of memory your runtime occupies is directly subtracted from the amount of memory your application gets. The more layers your runtime piles up that cannot be shared between applications -- the more memory you consume without actually offering any functionality.<p>3. Every additional layer needs some processing time. Writing into a buffer that gets efficiently transfered into video memory is always going to be slower than JIT-ing instructions that write something into a buffer that gets efficiently transfered into video memory -- <i>at the very least</i> the first time around.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if someone is actually trying to say or (futilely) prove that a web application is going to be as fast as a native one (assuming, of course, the native environment is worth a fsck) -- that&#x27;s something people would be able to predict easily. This isn&#x27;t rocket science, as long as you leave the jQuery ivory tower every once in a while.<p>The question of whether it&#x27;s fast <i>enough</i>, on the other hand, is different, but I think it&#x27;s eschewing the wider picture of where &quot;fast&quot; is in the &quot;efficiency&quot; forest.<p>I honestly consider web applications that don&#x27;t actually depend on widely, remotely accessible data for their function to be an inferior technical solution; a music player that is written as a web application but doesn&#x27;t stream data from the Internet and doesn&#x27;t even issue a single HTTP request to a remote server is, IMO, a badly engineered system, due to the additional technical complexity it involves (even if some of it is hidden). That being said, if I had to write a mobile application that should work on more than one platform (or if that platform were Android...), I&#x27;d do it as a web application for other reasons:<p>1. The fragmentation of mobile platforms is incredible. One can <i>barely</i> handle the fragmentation of the Android platform alone, where at least all you need to do is design a handful of UI versions of your app. Due to the closed nature of most of the mobile platforms, web applications are really the only (if inferior, shaggy and poorly-performing) way to write (mostly) portable applications instead of as many applications as platforms.<p>2. Some of the platforms are themselves economically untractable for smaller teams. Android is a prime example of that; even if we skip over the overengineering of the native API, the documentation is simply useless. The odds of having a hundred monkeys produce something on the same level of coherence and legibility as the Android API documentation by typing random letters on a hundred keyboards are so high, Google should consider hiring their local zoo for tech writing consultance. When you have deadlines to meet and limited funding to use (read: you&#x27;re outside your parents&#x27; basement) for a mobile project, you can&#x27;t always afford that kind of stuff.<p>Technically superior, even when measurable in performance, isn&#x27;t always &quot;superior&quot; in the real life. Sure, the fact that a programming environment with bare debugging capabilities, almost no profiling and static analysis capabilities to speak of and limited optimization options at best is the best you can get for mobile applications is sad, but I do hope it&#x27;s just the difficult beginning of an otherwise productive application platform.<p>I also don&#x27;t think the fight is ever going to be resolved. Practical experience shows users&#x27; performance demands are endless: we&#x27;re nearly thirty years from the first Macintosh, and yet modern computers boot slower and applications load slower than they did then. If thirty years haven&#x27;t filled the users&#x27; thirst for good looks and performance, chances are another thirty years won&#x27;t, either, so thirty years from now we&#x27;ll still have people frustrated that web applications (or whatever cancerous growth we&#x27;ll have then) aren&#x27;t fast enough.<p>Edit: there&#x27;s also another point that I wanted to make, but I forgot about it while ranting the things above. It&#x27;s related to this:<p>> Whether or not this works out kind of hinges on your faith in Moores Law in the face of trying to power a chip on a 3-ounce battery.  I am not a hardware engineer, but I once worked for a major semiconductor company, and the people there tell me that these days performance is mostly a function of your process (e.g., the thing they measure in nanometers).   The iPhone 5s impressive performance is due in no small part to a process shrink from 45nm to 32nm  a reduction of about a third.  But to do it again, Apple would have to shrink to a 22nm process.<p>The point the author is trying to make is valid IMHO -- Intel&#x27;s processors do benefit from having a superior fabrication technology, but just like in the case above, &quot;raw&quot; performance is really just one of the trees in the &quot;performance&quot; view.<p>First off, a really advanced, difficult manufacturing process isn&#x27;t nice when you want massive production. ARM isn&#x27;t even on 28 nm yet, which means that the production lines are cheaper; the process is also more reliable, and being able to keep the same manufacturing line in production for a longer time also means the whole thing costs less on a long term. It also works better when you have an economic model like ARM&#x27;s -- you license your chips, rather than producing them. When you have a bunch of vendors competing for the same implementation of a standard, with many of them being able to afford the production tools they need, chances are you&#x27;re going to see lower cost just from the competition effect. There&#x27;s also the matter of power consumption, which isn&#x27;t negligible at all, especially due to batteries being such nasty, difficult beasts (unfortunately, we suck at storing electrical energy).<p>Overall, I think that within a year or two, once the amount of money shoved into mobile systems will reach its peak, we&#x27;ll see a fairly slower rate of performance improvement on mobile platforms, at least in terms of raw processing power. Improvements will start coming from other areas.",1373398247

This, along with separate streams for twitch and youtube...</i><p>This isn&#x27;t a sales pitch so much as an offer to chat about it and see if we could help turn a service we provide into a product that meets this need.<p>For years we&#x27;ve provided this as a &quot;private label&quot; service to major media companies that need to provide one single broadcast quality live stream and have it delivered to thousands or hundreds of thousands of end users on Windows and OSX (RTMP), Android (RTSP), and iOS (HLS), in bitrates ranging from 300 kbps to 6 megabits, while also pushing the full array of bitrates to YouTube, Hulu, etc.<p>The problem is that this is not cheap.  Pulling it off with low latency and across a full array of formats and protocols tends to require dedicated hardware (depends on the source material, talking heads easier than sports, for example).  But our approach does cost significantly less than trying to use AWS instances, and if the community of broadcasters or viewers was large enough, it might make sense for us to open up this private label service to individuals.<p>Feel free to ping me if someone wants to talk about it.",1373398222

No doubt any day now we&#x27;ll reorganize the internet around shipping punched-card images around, too.  We could call the project the &quot;Because It&#x27;s Time Network&quot;, or BITNET.<p>> Of course, most people would argue that you don&#x27;t save enough time or bandwidth or cpu cycles to make a difference, but it would make for easier-to-write parsers.<p>Most people would argue that, yes; famously, Kernighan and Plauger did argue that in <i>The Elements of Programming Style</i> in 1974.  By &quot;easier-to-write parsers&quot;, you mean easier than dict(((key.lower(), value.lstrip()) for key, value in (line.split(&#x27;:&#x27;, 1) for line in header.split(&#x27;\r\n&#x27;))))?  Because I think that&#x27;s going to be a pretty tough bar to fit under.  (Yeah, I know you need another couple of lines of code if you&#x27;re going to handle indented continuation lines, but you can get rid of those without returning your protocol design to the Summer of Love.  You could also get rid of the .lower() and the .lstrip() while you&#x27;re at it.)<p>> Add to this that every header could have a 32-bit identifier (4 bytes)<p>Padding out sub-byte-sized values to fill out fixed-width fields: the Intelligent Man&#x27;s Approach to Saving Bandwidth!  Or you could just use one-letter names in an ASCII protocol.<p>> [Fixed-length fields] solves crazy problems like header injection and request integrity checking.<p>Clearly we&#x27;ve never had parsing bugs in binary protocols full of fixed-width fields, now have we?  Surely not bugs that produced security holes?  Except maybe TCP, IP, and DNS.  And X.400, and X.500, and X.509, and some of those were the fault of ASN.1 BER and DER, which are hardly fixed-width formats.  And surely silently truncating a value to put it into a fixed-width field would never change its semantics, right?<p>> as to a general question &quot;why use binary when we can compress stuff&quot;, what is smaller: a string of bits, or a compressed string of digits?<p>Well, let&#x27;s see.  How many files do I have here?<p><pre><code>    $ find | wc
       5946   17074  330147
</code></pre>
Each one has a ctime, an mtime, an atime, and an inode number.  The ctime is generally going to be the same as the mtime in this case, so we&#x27;ll leave it out.  I think they&#x27;re technically 64-bit values in the current inode structure, but let&#x27;s count them as 32 bits instead, since none of my files are from after 2038.  The inode number is also 32 bits.  So if we take these three 32-bit values per file, we have 594612 bytes, or 71352 bytes.  And if we print them out as digits and compress them?<p><pre><code>    $ find -printf %.10A@%.10T@%i | gzip -9c | wc -c
    46278
</code></pre>
But wait, that string of digits isn&#x27;t parsable; it&#x27;s just digits.  So let&#x27;s add delimiters.<p><pre><code>    $ find -printf %.10A@\ %.10T@\ %i\\n | head -3
    1373396230 1373338685 2359306
    1372967497 1372967489 5246218
    1365458166 1365458157 5248264
    $ find -printf %.10A@\ %.10T@\ %i\\n | gzip -9c | wc -c
    47506
</code></pre>
So a compressed string of digits is a lot smaller in this case.  But you could argue that that&#x27;s just because my data is highly redundant, since most of the timestamps are going to be within the current few years, which is true.  But then, most data is highly redundant.  How bad can it get, in the worst case of representing uniformly distributed random 32-bit values as compressed strings of digits, with spaces between?  It adds about 44% overhead:<p><pre><code>    $ dd </dev/urandom bs=1024 count=1 | 
      od -w1024 -l | tr -s &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; |

    1+0 records out

They do go away if you tunnel over a deflate-compressed VPN, or if you increase the available bandwidth by a few percent.

He went from saying &quot;Well, it&#x27;s not really that much&quot; to &quot;Oh, it would be even higher if it weren&#x27;t solar&quot;.<p>Let me point out a few things:<p>Germany is further north, and its population weighted climate is cooler.  It has larger heating needs than France.  Electricity is an godawful energy source for heating.  Check out payback periods of solar hot water when substituting for NG hot water heaters vs electric water heaters.  If Germany wanted to substitute low/no carbon heating they&#x27;d be better off with passive solar systems or geothermal - not solar PV or nuclear electricity.  The very article he linked to was about France having to buy German electricity because they couldn&#x27;t heat their own country w/ their huge nuclear fleet in a cold snap.  The conclusion to be drawn there is that France&#x27;s energy policy is flawed, not Germany&#x27;s.<p>Also, heating methods aside, the metric is not honest.  France has a smaller demand base than Germany (quick research: approximately 650TWh vs 525TWh in the mid 2000s) and Germany&#x27;s economy is more industrial and energy intensive, which frequently doesn&#x27;t permit electrical substitution.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t have time to write more or edit this a bunch.

First, the 4th amendment is about searches and not monitoring. In 1789, the police could have followed you around, asked all your neighbors who you talked too, gotten lists of everything you bought from the stores you went to, gotten information about your finances from your bank and accountant, etc, and they could have done all that without a warrant. Second, the &quot;third party doctrine&quot; makes the 4th amendment mostly inapplicable to online privacy. It basically says that if you expose information voluntarily to a third party, you can&#x27;t claim 4th amendment protections for it. Under this doctrine, your bank records are not protected. It hasn&#x27;t been decided in court yet, but arguably your Facebook posts aren&#x27;t protected either, or the contents of your Google Drive, etc. This is all information you&#x27;re voluntarily exposing to Google, Facebook, etc, as opposed to keeping it &quot;private.&quot;<p>Someone in a sibling post to yours pointed out: but in 1789 it wasn&#x27;t possible to tail everyone. That&#x27;s true. In 1789, if you wanted to watch someone&#x27;s comings and goings, you had to post a policeman outside their house. Today, you can put cameras everywhere. Similarly, in 1789, people didn&#x27;t regularly update third parties with their exact location every few seconds. But today people do just that with their cell phones. But there is no legal principle that says that police investigatory powers that were previously legal become illegal as soon as they can automate the process. And moreover, especially in front of a conservative Supreme Court like the one we have, &quot;results oriented&quot; arguments aren&#x27;t going to fly. You can&#x27;t start from the position of saying: &quot;we want to make the surveillance state illegal&quot; and try to figure out how to re-purpose the 4th amendment to make it so.<p>Basically, I think Constitutional challenges to NSA surveillance are not really going to have much impact other than chipping away at the edges. I can imagine a future in which a Supreme Court reevaluates things like the third party doctrine in light of how people communicate in the modern world. But: 1) conservative jurists don&#x27;t like to do that at all (they&#x27;re &quot;original intent&quot; kind of people); and 2) even liberal jurists don&#x27;t like to do it until there is a critical mass of public thought on the side of that interpretation.<p>The Supreme Court <i>could</i> pull a Roe v. Wade and find a far-reaching protection of privacy and communications in the 4th amendment. That could invalidate large parts of the surveillance state, including things like drone surveillance of public areas. But they&#x27;re not going to do that until at least a large minority of people in the public and in academia think that way.<p>And that&#x27;s the problem with people who oppose the surveillance state. They&#x27;re a tiny minority. They can&#x27;t get Congress to act, they can&#x27;t get the President to Act, and they can&#x27;t even convince enough of liberal academia to support their position to get &quot;living Constitution&quot; judges to act. So the policy position is basically dead in the water.",1373396613

6014542,comment,6012525,6013206,27,0,brokenparser,,,"A binary protocol is bad for a couple of reasons, too.<p>First, OSI layer 6 called and it wants its old job back. It sat around connecting layers 5 and 7 peacefully since the dawn of the ARPANET, all while the HTTPbis guys were passing around messages back and forth trying to obsolete it.<p>Second, you can&#x27;t type a binary protocol. Yet, you have to somehow make the server work without a client or vice versa (for the initial implementation). That&#x27;s going to be a lot more difficult. With HTTP, you could literally hook up a teletype to the Internet, let it print incoming requests and <i>type</i> the response back to the user agent. I&#x27;ve done this occasionally on a terminal emulator for debugging purposes.<p>Third, the Internet is big-endian while most common processors in use today are little-endian. This is going to haunt peoples lives forever because you have to continuously convert between the two and although the conversions are orthogonal, the methods aren&#x27;t idempotent (as opposed to converting a string to ASCII, or a text buffer to DOS style line endings).<p>You mention 32-bit identifiers as opposed to a string of digits. This is more error-prone than you think, two&#x27;s complement isn&#x27;t the only integer representation out there. Implementations written in C would have to deal with their underlying architecture as the standard allows for 3 different representations (so the compiler wouldn&#x27;t help you out). Then there&#x27;s signed and unsigned, either of which might not be available in the implementers programming language. You end up unpacking the identifier by hand, which may end up being slower than just looping through a string. ASCII is hardly an inefficient serialisation format.<p>Fourth, any fixed-length records are going to be useless at some point in the future. Several versions later the fixed length records are going to either point to an extra set of records tailing the 2.0 records or will simply have a (designated) backwards compatible value for consumption by older peers. With HTTP, we can add a header anywhere in the request or response except for the very top. We can even shuffle them at will without adverse effects on peers.<p>Fifth, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to optimise a tiny fraction of the entire HTTP session. Any benefits are too small to be worthwhile and would therefore result in a net-negative to most implementers.<p>Sixth, you can still make improvements to HTTP without moving to a binary protocol. Not sending the same headers on every single request isn&#x27;t one of them. HTTP is essentially a stateless protocol and every request could be handled by a different server. You can architect clusters of servers routing incoming requests however you please and satisfy every one of them correctly and efficiently. For starters, you can replace any underlying protocol in the stack with a more cluster-friendly protocol in transit.<p>Seventh, just because no one is using a given content type in HTTP (I think you were referring to multipart/related) doesn&#x27;t mean the protocol used to transfer that content is bad. Heck, it&#x27;s not even part of any HTTP standard.",1373396448

With each new interface you use, you load a new set of metaphors and interactions into your brain to help you navigate, understand, and use whatever it is that you are using. The interface needs to be relatable, or at least offer an explanation of how to use it. Having more experience with interfaces will make you more familiar with different design patterns and such, but there is a limit to how much we can relate to.<p>This isn't about readability, but rather usability, so I find your examples poor. It's not just about typography and whitespace. Yes, they are simple and on the ""same visual plane"", but they follow design patterns that have existed on the web for many years: Navigation placement is on the top and left, links are either underlined or highlighted. On the other hand, svbtle is using bizarre navigation visual cues at the top which need some level of inspection or trust to use, and medium doesn't have a standard navigation at all. They are designing away elements of the webpage that people are familiar with.",1356677542

If you have venture capitalists you want to listen to their advice as well. Don't make an excuse that you are young and don't have experience and the opportunity cost is it eats up your younger days. You can't be a Lone Ranger, you need to be developing a team, a diverse team of people with different backgrounds and different skill sets. Don't limit yourself to just people in their 20s by the way.<p>I spent my 20s and 30s writing software for companies, inventing new things, and having managers taking credit for everything I did. I expected pay raises and promotions, but those went to the people in the managers' social kliqs who had people skills (bullsh*tting, backstabbing, drinking at happy hour with the rest, gossiping, schmozing around the office instead of working, watering office plants, making coffee, etc.) instead of technical skills (developing code, coming up with new ideas for inventions and software, writing documentation, debugging, knowing how a computer works, knowing how to do research analysis and design, quality control, keeping up with trends via Hacker News and other sites) and my problem was that I was too good at the technical skills and I had to go. So I was 'used' to get to 'goals' and once those goals were reached I'd be fired and then find work at another company where it started all over again. Until the stress of it all made me too sick to work and I ended up on disability.

I have dual degrees in computer science and business management, but it just don't matter anymore.<p>The second myth, yes you need to focus on more than the business. My mistake was not focusing on my emotional, physical, and mental health and I got really sick doing my ""balls to the wall"" software development and focusing 100% of my energy into my job. Always keep a backup career as well in case software development or whatever doesn't work out. Find something you love to do and turn it into a hobby, that you might be able to turn into a business.

He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds.

4976700,comment,4976453,4976453,2,0,Capricornucopia,,,"I stand out a little bit, because although I'm a ""Valley-type techie"", I'm also a woman with purple hair. Being a woman in tech has its pros and cons.\nThe Silicon Valley I'M based out of is what some in the tech media refer to as ""Silicon Valley North""- Toronto. (I also live near downtown, but that's irrelevant.)\nI was a computer whiz ever since I was a very young girl. By the time I was 11, it was 1995 and I just got into web development, as a self-taught hobby. (There, I just dated myself.)\nI didn't even consider a career in tech until I was already in my mid-20s. Why? I theorize that being female (girls aren't encouraged to get into computing as much as boys are) was a minor reason, but being told by teachers in the public school system for years that you have to be EXCELLENT at math to get into computing professionally is the main one. I'm not bad at math, but I thought I was when I was a kid. I blame former Ontario premier Mike Harris. In the 1990s, he really fucked up the school system. One of the policy/curriculum changes he and John Snobelen orchestrated was ""show your work"" in math. As soon as arithmetic and algebra get more complex, I use different techniques to solve problems than the mainstream ones in textbooks. For example, I don't do long division. I look at a division problem, figure out what the largest ""X times Y"" is that fits into the number I'm dividing, and I work back and forth from there. I can even get a decimal answer correct down to the first few places (3.451, for example), just give me enough time with a pencil and paper.<p>The way my brain is wired, you can try teaching me long division thousands of times, but my math work in practice will always be with the methods that correlate with how my brain thinks about numbers.<p>Getting the correct answer without cheating wasn't enough in the Mike Harris curriculum. If, when you ""show your work"", you aren't using the method that's on the blackboard or in the textbook, you get NO MARKS. Therefore, even though I'm competent enough in math (I wrote my GED later on without studying and got a higher mark than 99% of the adult test takers in the province that year, plus I scored perfectly in the math battery), I thought I was a ""dummy.""<p>And since I was told by teachers over and over again that you have to be EXCELLENT in math to get into a career in computing, and those same teachers convinced me I was HORRIBLE at math... guess what?<p>But in my teens and into my 20s, I kept using computers constantly every day, and I carried on with my web development projects. Web design was only a ""hobby"" for me, after all.<p>I had lots of jobs in retail and in call centres. In my personal life, if someone's Windows machine had a problem, I fixed it for them. But I never considered a tech career until I was 25. Which doesn't sound too late, until you consider the people who started working in IT when they were 18.<p>Well, guess what? People who entered my life in my adulthood kept telling me that I'm ""really good with computers.""<p>I started developing websites for a few small businesses because people close to me saw the work I did as a ""hobby."" I also wrote my CompTIA A+ in my mid 20s and passed with flying colours.<p>I got into consumer remote Windows tech support (as a call centre employee) for a couple of years. My tickets were varied, but a full 60% of them or more were malware related. Thus began my fascination with not only malware, but IT security in general.<p>Word spread that I'm good at removing really nasty malware (rootkits that malware removal programs don't have signatures for, etc.), and hardening/securing Windows (which, as we all know, is not a very secure OS platform to begin with, even with the NT kernel and NTFS file system), Mac (more secure because of its Unix roots, but no software is perfect), and Linux (ditto). So I got a job writing about IT security for the InfoSec Institute! <a href=""http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/author/kimcrawley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/author/kimcrawley</a><p>Not too long ago, I met a wonderful man, in a setting that had nothing to do with IT or development. His name is Sean Rooney, and we fell in love. It probably helped that, by an amazing series of coincidences, we have the same interests for the most part. It was an amazing coincidence that he's one of the top IT security people Canada has ever produced. He's contributed to the curriculum of the CompTIA Security+ and the CISSP, among others. He's contributed to Canada's laws regarding digital security and rights. He helped catch the notorious USENET ""hacker"" of the 80s and 90s, ""Hipcrime"". He's worked for the Canadian Military, Alcatel (public transit system controllers in big cities around the world), and the RCMP, among other big clients.<p>Sadly, although the old IT security he founded, Coldstream, was very successful for 14 years, a corrupt accountant and a corrupt bureaucrat brought the company down.<p>Now that we're together, we've relaunched his old company as our new one, Cyberia Labs. <a href=""http://cyberialabs.coldstream.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyberialabs.coldstream.ca</a>\nWe have some of the old Coldstream team members with us, including a top cryptogapher, Sandy Harris.<p>I'm working with computer scientists who can blow me away in many areas of IT and development. But interestingly enough, I'm quicker and better at Windows tech support than any of them, and that also includes Windows Server. I'm the only web developer on the team. So whereas Sandy speaks C++ and Perl, and Sean speaks Assembly languages, I'm the only one who speaks HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP. I'm also an art school dropout. I've had a passion for visual art ever since I was a little girl, and I'm equally comfortable in analogue mediums and digital mediums. I was also a good art college student, but seeing my classmates live as starving artists for the most part, and realizing that my teachers would be starving artists if it weren't for their teaching jobs... discouraged me. But in a group full of techies, I'm the only artist, so I can make our website look nice, etc.<p>I also have had a bit of a career in soft journalism. My tech writing is for the InfoSec Institute, but if you Google my real name, Kim Crawley, you'll find some op-eds I wrote which were syndicated in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and other publications. I got the writing bug from my Dad, who is a rather successful novelist. So, I'm the only member of the Cyberia team who can write in ""English"" to a professional, readable standard. I've edited technical and scientific articles from many scientists and tech people. Their ideas are wonderful! Their content is amazing! But it's totally unreadable. If I had a penny for every time I had to turn a scientist's 500 word sentence into several paragraphs...<p>So you see, dmor, even though I'm a ""techie"" and I'm the co-founder of a tech startup (we already have clients!), my non-tech skills- art, creative writing, my ability to translate ""techie speak"" into language end users understand, and my instinct for marketing, make me vital to our team.<p>Although I really dislike Steve Jobs (his walled garden system for Apple products, and the way he's abused his subordinates over the years), no one can argue that he had a natural talent for marketing.<p>In THAT sense only, I see myself as Cyberia's ""Steve Jobs"" to my fiance Sean's ""Steve Wozniak"". I'm technically inclined enough to ""fit-in"" in Silicon Valley, but Sean is the one with the patents and white papers. (Sandy has patents too, and it's all very important IT security related technology.) But I'm the ""pretty"" one (not that Jobs was ""pretty"", but you know what I mean), and I'm the one who can market, make things look stylish and artistic, and sell our business to people who aren't ""nerds.""<p>I figure, dmor, a lot of the people here on HN have non-tech skills and talents that help them in their tech careers. And  getting good at those non-tech skills would be impossible if there wasn't some non-tech in their backgrounds or experience.",1356675454

As somewhere to get started - to bootstrap your learning enough so you can do self-directed projects. Really, I think I am going to have to buy 5 or more of the top-recommended jQuery/CSS books just to get started (even if I don't read them).<p>For iOS to Android ports, I recommend usually just using the iOS app (if it exists) as a black-box reference model /specification for functionality. The Charles proxy server [1] usually figures out any gray areas in the server-side interaction. Having access to the iOS source code/understanding it isn't always necessary unless there is some kind of shared library being used (shrouded C/JNI). A lot of the more complicated iOS apps have lots of CoreData/KVO-type/massive 3rd party library dependency like RestKit infrastructure that isn't directly translatable.<p>The best thing about iOS v. Android is that usually iOS developers <i>aren't</i> Android developers (as you pointed out). And it still flabbergasts me that Android has won (75% and increasing market share worldwide).<p>However, personally I'm thinking of getting back into iOS - (Storyboards, GCD) by doing small, small projects. iOS is still a very marketable skill.<p>When it comes to being 'Really Good at Android', I think you will get there. Have you presented/taught Android yet? It does take someone who reallyreallyreally likes Android to make the app look good (xml layouts, arcane knowledge) and functional and smooth (no ANR). Do check out all of the Google I/O talks if you have not already. The hardest part about Android v. iOS is that the knowledge sharing isn't as open as it is in the iOS world.<p>Hope you can find someone to partner with. Usually our  developers find other developers that they like to work with semi-organically - by just working on a number of other, larger projects and every once in a while, they gell with someone and either start apprenticing the developer (assuming they are still junior) or work with them as a peer.<p>Either way, it sounds like you are diversifying your skill set appropriately.<p>Finally, in case you get bored/need anything else to work on for 2013 - try to teach some aspects of coding to non-coders (especially those who might have the potential but not the understanding).<p>Don't forget to double your rates this year :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.charlesproxy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.charlesproxy.com</a>",1356675031

I got in trouble for spending a couple weeks helping another engineer replace 90% of the work I was supposed to do with a relational database. I didn't even have to build the software, they previously had it and then it broke and rather than fixing it, they were just doing it manually.<p>The next summer, I interned at Boeing where I spent the first month reading dry paper manuals because I was waiting to get a computer, and because my boss was too lazy/busy to find real work for me to do.

They were paying a full-time engineer $70k to do the same thing I was doing as an intern. The final month was finally spent doing some real engineering work (something about dissimilar metals.)<p>After those two experiences of how backwards and fucked up the aerospace sector is, I decided I would just keep doing web dev, which I'd been doing since I was about 15 (programming since I was about 12 or 13.) Currently in NYC working for Etsy.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX</a>",1356674512

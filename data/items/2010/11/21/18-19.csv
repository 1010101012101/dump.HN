I know it's hard to see it that way right now, but you were given an incredible gift in the time that the two of you had together.    The fact that it was cut short so abruptly and meaninglessly doesn't take away from that; if anything, it highlights it.<p>In terms of ""how"", there is no magic answer; you just try to keep learning, and keep giving to others, to the best of your ability.<p>You say that you used to speak for an hour each day; I'd suggest that you spend a portion of that time writing down things you remember-- lessons, anecdotes, etc.  The time may come, years from now, when you'll be glad you have some tangible reminders of his advice.<p>Good luck to you.",1290365952

If they could be added or removed without changing the sentence, then you wouldn't be suggesting their removal.<p>""To be honest"" and ""in fact"" do change the meaning of the sentence, just in subtle ways.

1927591,comment,1927275,1927275,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is an awful article. The title is linkbait and the opinions offered are given with little contradictory evidence.<p>Anticipating what somebody's response might be -- ""you hurt my feelings!"" or ""You're lying"" -- is part of human communication. Why have three exchanges when I can just anticipate your response and cover the most likely mistakes you might make? Moves the conversation along faster.<p>They also serve a critical role in the emotional nature of discourse. If I say, ""To be honest"", I am preparing the listener for something that might be more blunt than they are prepared to hear. ""No offense, but"" gets the reader ready to hear something they may find offensive. It's not that I am being disingenuous. Far from it. I'm simply trying to apply a little balm before the burn comes.<p>In life we have to say things to people that they may not want to hear. It is critically important that we learn how to ""do the dance"" with throwaway words and phrases like this in order that we can give -- and get -- information we may find hard to digest. Yes, you can pull out a broad brush and say it's lying, but you're entirely missing the point of such phrases by doing so.<p>Written communication to some degree mirrors vocal communication. We will always have a need to help each other emotionally as we talk about important things. Calling each other liars because the literal meanings of phrases don't exactly match up with the intention of the speaker is to confuse the practice of language with the semantic meaning of the words, something any linguist worth his salt should know not to do.",1290365945

She was about to leave it with the Sears guy when the man behind me said to her, ""It's none of my business, but there are terminals attached to that battery that you might need when you put the new one back in the car"" (or something like that).  He was right, and they were grateful to him for pointing it out.  I thought it was an interesting politeness, actually, that he prefaced his comment as he did.  In his place I would probably have started out with ""Excuse me, ..."", which I don't think is wrong, but his more elaborate intro perhaps made it clearer that he knew he was butting in, albeit with the clear intent to be helpful.",1290365712

I get offered a lot of rides home (because I live without a car).  Women routinely bend over backwards to offer to make permanent arrangements to shuttle me back and forth to work and ask me things like ""when do you normally leave for work?"" or ""when do you typically get off work?""  Men don't make offers like that.  In fact, men will say ""I can drop you a mile down the road at the next light"" and thus only take me part way home, whereas no woman has ever made me an offer like that.  Women typically feel compelled to drop me at my doorstep.  In contrast, there are two different men who, when they pick me up, frequently drop me at the entrance to my apartment complex.  I'm fine with that.  There is only one woman who has started doing that and she is much more apologetic.<p>(And, yes, I am a woman -- not young but people routinely misread my age as roughly five years younger than I really am.

1927556,comment,1899310,1900801,0,0,rograndom,,,"Do you mean start one from scratch or join an existing rakeback provider as a sub-affilate?<p>If you're starting one from scratch, the players under you will need to be putting massive volume for you to offer competive rates. For example, FullTilt will pay you 20% of the rake paid by the players signed up under you. Compare this to the existing rakeback providers who generally payout 27% for fulltilt. You're losing money here. You'll have to move up 2 tiers to having your players generate at least $25,000 in rake per month to get to a 30% payout tier, where you're making 3%, not counting overhead and acquisition costs. If you get to $50,000 per month, you'll get another bump to 35%. How many players do you think it'll take to get to that level?<p>The other option is to sign up with an existing rakeback provider and leverage their platform. They already have a ton of players and are able to offer top payouts across multiple sites. You'll generally get 2-5% of your players rake here, but you only have acquisition costs and the sites generally run promotions for your players like freerolls.<p>The second option is what most of the training sites use and that is their primary income stream, even though they're charging $25-30/mo for access. If they're able to make the players in their downline better, the players will play longer, move up in stakes and generate more rake.<p>In general pros don't want to waste money acquiring a player who isn't really good, deposits $50-$200, generates $0.59 in rev share for the pro, goes broke in a week and never plays again.",1290364807

1927532,comment,1925884,1927348,0,0,JabavuAdams,,,"> Calling bad genes a form of political force is to commit the same epistemological error ...<p>This is interesting and telling. I've done no such thing. You seem to be focused entirely on this notion of political force, whereas I'm not. This is what I mean when I point out that you're placing ideology above any practical or empirical concerns.<p>We did not start out talking about political force. It's only vaguely related to my argument, yet it seems to be very interesting to you. From my side it appears that I've triggered one of your auto-rant keywords. Until your most recent response, it wasn't clear to me that I was responding to a human rather than a chat bot.<p>Here's is my point, again, so we can stay focused: relieving some of the pressure of immediate survival does not reduce creativity nor innovation. In fact, as demonstrated throughout history, creativity and innovation (as opposed to  just cunning) require that people have spare time that they're not devoting purely to survival. Surely you must have heard of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.<p>> Developing and expressing thoughts clearly (which is what ""all-or-nothing"" thinking is)<p>Well, I suppose we're all free to choose our own definitions, but this is quite the abuse of the term. ""All or nothing thinking"" is generally understood to mean the inability or unwillingness to recognize that nuance matters in discussion.<p>There are many ideas that can be expressed clearly, but that are wrong. While removal of nuance may result in a clearer message, it rarely results in clearer thinking. This is the peril of the sound bite.<p>""For every complex question there is an answer that is simple, obvious, and wrong.""<p>Could you please start providing some evidence or anecdotes for your claims (not parables). If you can't at least do that, I'm not really interested in continuing this discussion, as it's essentially a rant.",1290364181

What occurred to me is that what she has learned in that specific case, of getting a free cab fare worth $30 or $60, is something that many attractive young women learn about men. Knowing how to work it and being able to can be a ego booster as long as one is young and attractive. It is not however necessarily something that benefits the world, nor is it necessarily good for the person in the long run as their beauty fades and they find men are not as accommodating. The lessons learned in this specific situation, while important, are not the same as the general lessons of ""rejection therapy"" where one learns to take more risks as a life hack. Once the learning branches into getting free stuff because one is a pretty girl, then it's really a different issue. My observation is that free cab fare just for asking is something that is not available to men. To make sure, I even tried it out last night and was told ""GFY"" by the cabbie. I'll keep trying on occasion, but I am pretty sure I am right that this one has a strong gender age and looks component to how it works.<p>Also, want to make clear the cab was the only one I felt this was the driving factor since it was a pretty expensive free gift for a businessman to just hand over to anyone. The forklift lessons were a pretty good and reasonable one since it's not a common request, you learn a useful skill, and the driver often will enjoy it as well so that all parties benefit. In my opinion, the sorts of deals one wants to work with their confidence and curiosity are ones that benefit all parties, and not only one sided.",1290364014

1927460,comment,1927096,1927096,0,0,cousin_it,,,"What... ouch. This is not math, this is... I don't even.<p>Read the post closely. The author introduces a set S of squarey curves approximating a circle. This set has an obvious correspondence with the natural numbers: there is curve #1, curve #2, etc. Then the author defines a function f: S->S that takes curve #n to curve #n+1. Wait, that doesn't sound right! The function f has no interesting structure whatsoever, it's exactly equivalent to defining f(n)=n+1 on the naturals. Of course, taking the ""limit"" of a function f: S->S makes no sense at all.<p>What would make sense is taking the limit of a certain function N->C, where N is the naturals and C is the set of all curves on the plane. That is, the limit of a sequence of curves (not of a function from curves to curves as the OP tried to say). To talk about such limits, you need to define what it means for a sequence of curves to converge - a ""topology"" on C. There are many ways to do that, some more outlandish than others. One way is <i>pointwise</i> convergence: assume a parameterization t->C_i(t) on each curves in the sequence, and require that C_i(t) converges co C_lim(t) for each t separately.<p>Now, pretty much any reasonable notion of ""convergence"" on the space of all curves has to <i>imply</i> pointwise convergence. That is, pointwise convergence is a very ""weak"" notion of convergence: if we have a sequence of curves that has a limit in some reasonable sense, then it had better coincide with the pointwise limit, dontcha think?<p>And here we come to the second facepalm moment in the post. Under pointwise convergence, the sequence of squarey curves under discussion does <i>not</i> converge to some ""right angled fractal beast"". It converges to the circle. As n grows, every point on S_n comes closer and closer to some point on the circle. Ain't nothing more to it.<p>Now the correct explanation for the original puzzle. Pointwise convergence of curves doesn't imply that their lengths converge to the limit's length. Hell, we don't even need 2-dimensional space to show that! A simple <i>straight line</i> will do. Imagine a human traveling a straight road of 1km length in this fashion: he takes two steps forward, then one step back, then repeats. In the end he will have traveled about 3km instead of 1km. As we make the human and his steps tinier and tinier, his movement looks smoother and smoother to an external observer, but he still travels 3km in total instead of 1. Or maybe (going back to the 2D space) the human could take a step left, then forward, then right; this would make his path look like a fine comb that approximates the straight line more and more closely, but it's always 3x longer. Something like this is happening in the original puzzle.<p>Finishing touch: there <i>are</i> notions of convergence where it's true that the length of the curves in the sequence always converges to the length of the limit. One such notion says that the <i>direction of travel</i> (velocity vector) must also pointwise converge to the velocity vector of the limit curve. Under this definition of convergence, the original sequence of curves does not converge, because it makes too many sharp turns.",1290362439

It&#x27;s utterly pointless and idiotic. You keep suggesting that &#x27;all of these things add up&#x27;, but provide no evidence that they add up to more than 0.01% of the 20%.<p>I eat out at restaurants many times a week. If none of them served me any water, it might save 1-2 gallon per week (assuming I didn&#x27;t want the water at a single restaurant that gave it). Between drinking water elsewhere, bathroom breaks, a daily shower, dishes twice a week, and laundry once a week, we are talking about 1-2 percent of my usage at most. I eat out more than the average person, I DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE A LAWN, and we are already down to 1-2 percent of my consumption.<p>To put my consumption into perspective, my weekly amount is about the same as it takes to grow 1 or 2 almonds. Are you starting to see how idiotic it is to even consider stopping restaurants from serving water is?<p>The fact that they even considered this as feasible shows a complete lack of basic math skills or relative reasoning. I get that some people want to feel like they are helping with the drought so they do this kind of stuff, but it&#x27;s actively harmful because it gives the impression they are doing something useful.",1427874950

I&#x27;ve always worked under the assumption that everything the client sends is wrong; which means the only fields I issue are a user hash and session key. If either of those don&#x27;t match the session table record then the token is rejected.

You can&#x27;t judge the value of a vulnerability by how large its host company is, or even by its severity.<p>In the security industry we use the term &quot;vulnerability half-life&quot; for this purpose. Basically, a bug in Google will be discovered between a day and a week after it is first exploited instead of reported. If you try to commercialize it, it will quickly be discovered because the top tech companies have the best incident response teams in the world.<p>Once the flaw is patched once in Google, it&#x27;s effectively patched. Game over for the attacker. Compare this to a vulnerability like Heartbleed that is actually worth money - critical flaw that can compromise over a third of all the servers on the entire internet. If that vulnerability is patched anywhere, it&#x27;s not patched everywhere, unlike a single web application instance in Google.<p>The greater the half life, the greater the value of the vulnerability. A vulnerability in Java is worth money because it will still exist in the wild for years, providing consistent income and ROI for a purchased exploit.<p>A vulnerability in Facebook is worth money to Facebook for brand integrity, but it isn&#x27;t worth much to blackhat groups.

The original screencast at meteor.com/screencast is also a very useful introduction, and if you want to spend about half an hour building an app to get the basics down, meteor.com/try will do just that.<p>Using phantomjs to index your site has not caused any problems for most of us building apps in production for the past two years. From an engineering standpoint there are better alternatives such as server-side rendering (btw, there is a Meteor package that does this: <a href=""https://github.com/meteorhacks/meteor-ssr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/meteorhacks/meteor-ssr</a>), so outside of performance considerations this isn&#x27;t a super big deal. A lot of Meteor apps also aren&#x27;t Google-facing but instead apps that you use after log in, where Meteor&#x27;s advantages have the biggest effect on one&#x27;s productivity.<p>Meteor works in every evergreen browser and quite a few older ones. It will fall back to polling if there is no support for websockets and the Blaze view library works in IE8+.<p>I recommend just trying it out. It takes no time to install and get your first app started (<1 min) and you will immediately start to see the benefits. Come tell us more about your situation at forums.meteor.com and maybe we can help!",1427872960

This is a big problem for browsers which use the same input form box for URLs and search keywords.  Do you look up in DNS first, or with the search engine first?  DNS no-finds are relatively expensive operations; they may have to go to the root servers to get a definitive &quot;not found&quot;.  Having a relatively small set of TLDs avoided confusion between domain names and search queries.<p>Then there&#x27;s the relative domain problem.  Although it&#x27;s not used much any more, it&#x27;s a feature of DNS that if you&#x27;re on machine &quot;abc.example.com&quot;, and you look up domain &quot;xyz&quot;, it will try &quot;xyz.example.com&quot;.  The idea was that you could get at servers within your own organization without typing the fully qualified domain name. If you want the domain to be searched from the root, you&#x27;re supposed to type &quot;.&quot; after the domain, as in &quot;example.com.&quot;  Nobody knows this unless they&#x27;re really into DNS. There&#x27;s an adspam exploit that uses relative lookup to turn certain mistyped domains into ads on the domain &quot;com.com&quot;, which pretends to host all subdomains of the form &quot;*.com.com&quot;.  If you&#x27;re on &quot;example.com&quot;, and you look up &quot;nonexistentdomain.com&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t exist, the domain &quot;nonexistentdomain.com.com&quot; is tried as a relative lookup.  You get ads.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem of determining what&#x27;s a second level domain.  For that, you now need a very big list.  (The list is here: <a href=""https://publicsuffix.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://publicsuffix.org/</a>)<p>Current thinking seems to be to disallow single-word domains.

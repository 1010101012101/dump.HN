I additionally think that ""F.B. Purity"" could probably be defended (if not on ""nominative use"", then on how Facebook themselves largely prefers ""f"" to ""FB"" in their branding in addition to not capitalizing the B in general at all)... what I dislike is having that argument ""they don't own the letters FB"" thrown in there, as that isn't how trademark claims work. :(",1355921920

Why this world is like that? Some people seem to get angry when someone is trying to find out the reason <i>why</i> as if they'd have the answers.

The value is provided to the network of users and to advertisers who want to reach that audience.<p>The market shifted from radio, newspaper and television to web advertising. 20 years ago the $500M that Zuck donated would have otherwise went to an aristocratic media owning family empire. I prefer it going to somebody who has created new value and who will be putting the money to better use. Simply spending and gifting the money is a better use than hoarding it and establishing a genetic dynasty.<p>The argument about Facebook being a weapon against human development and integrity is the same argument that luddites (and the Amish) made against radio, television, the telephone and many other new inventions.<p>95% of the people that I know in my life, and 100% of the career moves I have made in my life were through people that I met online. The difference is that I was technical enough to know how to use IRC, how to use early blogs, etc. Facebook is simple and accessible, and allows the other 99% of the world population to take advantage of the same networking technology to enhance their lives.",1355921786

Work hard at their assigned stuff, or invest in self-directed labor?<p>I think there's something to be said for the zigzag strategy. Take finance jobs to improve comp, and more typical tech jobs to improve autonomy and technical knowledge. No tech company will match a $250,000 hedge fund salary, but most will compensate ""out of kind"" with a higher title and more authority. Then you do something awesome at your tech job and become qualified for a better finance job.<p>The other advantage of zigzagging is that you can overstate how politically successful you are, because you're moving into a context where people don't know how to evaluate your signals. If you claim you were at level X in finance when you were actually X - 2, other finance people will be able to tell based on what you actually did and how much you know about the industry. If you zigzag a bit, you have more control over your story.

The author says as much in several places, but then does not seem to think that that should be considered in their points about ""magic,"" immersion, and art. I found very little relevant evidence (even given that the premise is subjective and somewhat abstract), and they make foggy points like this with no real assertion:<p>> In the opening hour of The Hobbit shown in 3D HFR  I dont recall hearing a single sigh, or laugh. Not one.<p>Okay? Correlation does not imply causation. Maybe the audience of the 3D HFR show was more Tolkien and/or cinema fans that were taking the movie less lightheartedly, or were more introverted. And what does this even mean to say? The related point further on saying that the movie is too comedic - and in the wrong places - doesn't serve his premise any better.<p>I hadn't read much from the perspective of those against HFR, but if this is the only real argument, I think it's time to start pushing. There's no reason not to have all the visual information we can, and lower technology-imposed limitations. If filmmakers actually think that stuttering and blurs improve a movie, they can still add them! That's no reason to limit the technology, though.<p>For the record, my experience was similar. It was hard to shake the ""home movie"" feeling as I was watching it, and suspension of disbelief was a little harder.

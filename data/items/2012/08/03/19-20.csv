My point for 2 is that not all traffic needs to be encrypted. If there's no confidential or private data, why waste the CPU cycles?<p>3. I disagree. Having telnet available by default does not open any new attack vectors.<p>4. Telnet may not be designed for it, but that's how it's widely used. SMTP and port troubleshooting have been done with telnet for years, and quite successfully. I think there needs to be a balance between availability and protecting the user, and on a server OS, that line should probably lean towards availability since an advanced user is assumed. By your reasoning, the 'del' command shouldn't be available by default because an unassuming user might delete an important file.",1344023975

I mean, a lot has been written on the 'last touch' or 'first touch' problem.   And a lot has been done to mitigate that, but one of the first things you learn running a business is that if you don't understand  something? you massively over pay for it.   And I (and I think most business owners) don't understand how a last touch conversion tracking could tell me how that customer really heard about me, and more importantly, how I gained the credibility with that customer required for them to punch in their credit card.<p>Now, some people think they can compensate for that.  But, for me?  I don't understand how you could tell that a user learned about me from word of mouth (before they clicked on an adword that got them to my site and a signup.)  - To me, figuring that out is so hard that I might as well just focus on the brand-building kind of advertising.<p>Now, a lot of this is because most people are willing to pay a premium for the 'quantitative' advertising.  they are willing to pay extra for things they think they can track.  This means that if I'm right (and who knows)  then the brand-building advertising, that most people consider largely untrackable, is underpriced.<p>I mean, I'm not saying I'm right and you are wrong... just that there are a number of businesses that feel this way.",1344023238

If a service (say Spotify or Pandora or whatever) has a population P then the probability that they request a performance of a given piece might be f(P). Popularity might be measured by the number of unique people who request a performance g(P) and quality might be measured as the mode of the number of times a unique person requested a performance.<p>The remuneration rate, like the 'average selling price' for a commodity, is the median price of the performance across all requests.<p>My original point is that the 'size' of the music market, in terms of the number of times a song is played, is very very large. There are probably close to a billion 'plays' of songs on any given day in the US. I'm sure Pete Warden could come up with a way to figure out an exact number, I base that guess on half the population, 150M people, and 6 songs per person per day median, so 900M plays.<p>If the ASP, <i>to artists</i>, is $132/32000 (not saying it is, just its the only real number we've got in this discussion) that would make a daily sweep of like $3.7M. So if, as an artist you were the top song that day you might take home 1% of that or $37,000.<p>My overall point is that the music industry that is being birthed out of the ashes of the old one, looks a lot different. It's more 'on demand', it's more relational, and it's less understood. Consequently there are a lot of people trying to mold it to something they can control and get the money out of, and that reality distortion makes seeing the real forces driving it harder.<p>So when you reason about the music business and someone says ""Gee the artist only sees one tenth of a cent each time spotify plays their song."", that sounds horrible! A song, for only 0.1 cent? Gee I'd have to listen to the same song all day just so they could buy a cup of coffee at Peet's. But if that song is reasonably popular and it's being played 10 million times a day, that means the artist is making $10,000 a DAY on just one song. That sounds awesome!

No joke.  Her Ph.D. had been a big investment that got 'written off'.<p>Or couples that could have done what we tried just were not among our ancestors.  All this is in spite of what is commonly said would, could, and should be.<p>Thus, I suggest:  In simple terms, Mother Nature and Darwin have arranged that without certainty but with high probability in practice and significantly on average a 'professional woman' is a weak, sick, or dead limb on the tree.  Sorry 'bout that.  Wish I'd known that earlier.<p>How could this ""weak, sick, dead"" stuff be?  Here's a guess:  In our 'culture' from the past few thousand or ten thousand years, women nearly never had opportunities to pursue a 'profession' and became wives and mommies whether they really, consciously or otherwise, wanted to or not.  So, our 'nature', 'nurture'.  'social and psychological capital', and 'culture', or whatever, from the past kept the tree growing while, still, a significant fraction of the women didn't want to be just wives and mommies.<p>So, what's different now?  Now the US society and economy have changed giving many women an opportunity to pursue a career or profession, and, with significantly high probability, these women are removing their genes from the gene pool.<p>E.g., in Finland, women are encouraged to pursue careers, and on average the number of children born to a woman in Finland is about 1.5.  So, let's see:  For some simple arithmetic, with one generation of 25 years, after 150 years the population will fall by<p><pre><code>     100 * (1 - ( 1.5 / 2 ) ** 6 ) = 82.2%\n</code></pre>\nSo in the last 150 years or so Finland beat back the Swedes, Nazis, and Soviets but in the next 150 years are on track to lose out to careers for women!<p>This situation is common across Europe:  The gene pool is being severely pruned.  In simple terms, Europe is rapidly going extinct.<p>My guess is that the European gene pool is now in the period of most rapid change in at least the last 10,000 years.<p>Darwin stands to win this one:  What will be left will be women who really, REALLY want to be mommies in good families.<p>Darwin has more to say:  The situation for men is not easy, either:  For the tree to do well, men have to be good providers, good enough that their wives can concentrate on doing well in motherhood.  Some men are successful, and some are not -- Darwin again!<p>Without some big and chancy changes in work and families, thoughts about would, could, and should be pale to insignificance as Darwin wins again.<p>Or, it's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature!<p>Maybe in Finland and most of Europe, by the time the population falls by, say, 75% from now the new gene pool, 'culture', etc. that emphasizes motherhood along with the more favorable ratio of land to people will cause the population to stabilize and, then, start to grow again.

If Microsoft wants to compete in the tablet market with the RT, they'd better have something for under US$250, which would be a credible point in the non-iPad tablet market, assuming they can bring substantially better functionality to the table.

4335609,comment,4332084,4335150,1,0,lsc,,,"the problem is that you can't have our current levels of unemployment without a welfare state or serious social unrest (and usually both.)<p>We need the jobs.  Now, my understanding is that in terms of dollars, our manufacturing sector is growing, not quickly, but it is growing;  but in terms of jobs, it's shrinking.  Technology marches on.    Chinese labor doesn't usually compete with American labor.  Chinese labor competes with American machines.<p>China isn't the problem; the fact that we've automated away manufacturing the way we've automated away agriculture is.  200 years ago, nearly everyone was involved in some sort of agriculture or agriculture-support position.   Now?  that's less than 2% of the economy.   We found things for people to do when we automated away nearly all the agriculture work.  We need to do the same thing now that we've automated away nearly all the manufacturing work.<p>It's not the tax rate that stops people from hiring.  You could argue that it's the tax complexity;  I mean, the complexity does cause problems and increase risk.  but I don't think that's the real problem.  I think the real problem is that nobody has come up with a new business model to employ the masses and turn a good profit while paying a reasonable wage.<p>China is doing it by having humans do work that Machines could do better.  Essentially turning back the clock on automation of manufacturing.  Personally, I think that's a bad idea.  For the things that Machines can do, they are usually way better than humans.  And I don't think it would work for us, either, because the humans involved create less value, and thus can't be paid what we'd consider a reasonable wage.   It works for China because they have so many people that are so poor that what we'd call an unreasonably small wage is a step up.  That's not where we should go with this.  We should come up with a new class of jobs; start new businesses that do new things that turn the labor of the masses into more value than having them poorly mimic the work of machines.<p>so yeah.  what I'm saying is that living in a state with no debt but where only one person out of five can get a job?  that's worse than living in a state with near full employment and a bunch of debt.  Even if you don't care about human suffering, think of the crime rate and how much effort you'd need to put into keeping your stuff safe.<p>The jobs problem needs to be solved first.   I mean, I'm not saying that the government is the solution to the jobs problem (maybe they have a part to play and maybe they don't)  - just that the jobs problem is a much bigger deal than the debt problem.     And as the previous poster pointed out, it's easier to solve the debt problem once we have more people working and paying taxes.",1344020973

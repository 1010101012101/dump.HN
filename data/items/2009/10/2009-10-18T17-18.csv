Then, after promising to curb the influence of lobbyists, Obama hired a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist, Mark Patterson, as chief of staff at the Treasury. He hired another Goldmanite, Gary Gensler, to police the commodities markets. He handed control of the Treasury and Federal Reserve over to Geithner and Bernanke, a pair of stooges who spent their whole careers being bellhops for New York bankers. And on the first anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when he finally came to Wall Street to promote ""serious financial reform,"" his plan proved to be so completely absent of balls that the share prices of the major banks soared at the news.</i>",1255888629

My great grandad owned a tabacco factory in Cuba and my grandfather was an entertainer and writer. My dad had a variety of businesses from schlepping Encyclopedia Brittanica to real estate broker and my mom owned/operated a bridal gown shop.

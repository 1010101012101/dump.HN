So they are derived information, it's just that that takes ages and lots of disk seeks to count through.<p>Timestamps aren't really needed. They are information that is useful to use that we want to store, just like the date in an email. Thus they are as required as the names of the author and committer.<p>The reason for the discussion about the commit timestamps is (AIUI) a heuristic optimisation that works because they happen to be there and happen to (most of the time) be in order.",1310709547

But I don't see why the index has to be separate from HEAD ... in my model, every ""git add"" would automatically be followed by an implicit ""git commit --amend"".  So instead of building up your commit in the index you build it directly onto HEAD.<p>Since you're remotely sane, of course HEAD is a private branch not a public one (because you're perpetually modifying ""history"" on it).  (And to start a new commit, of course you also need a command which advances HEAD by creating an empty commit.)<p>To put it another way, the index should be just another branch.

2766426,comment,2764850,2765344,4,0,lojack,,,"I was once tasked with upgrading a Drupal instance and while I surely don't have the experience you do I have opposing feelings about this. Some of Drupal's more popular plugins are certainly well maintained, but for this case (and I imaging somewhat commonly in the industry) they used numerous obscure plugins, some of which were only in ""beta"" stage. In checking the repo logs of these plugins it seemed as though some hadn't been maintained for years.<p>There is also no database restrictions placed on the plugins, so they could literally modify any database schema. Not only do plugin A and plugin B know about each other, they are required to know about each other to function correctly; and I see that as a problem. While it can be argued that this is part of what gives Drupal its power and flexibility, I see this power as a very dangerous thing in a community of its size. It almost requires developers to put out quality plugins which is often not the case (for Drupal as well as any other community driven software products).",1310709242

The currently used timestamps are error prone and thus will be replaced by generation numbers which are more robust. They're still adhering to the principle of only storing the minimum amount of information, they're just adding generation numbers to that set.<p>In fact, you could make the argument that <i>timestamps</i> are the derived information that git has been storing all along while generation numbers are the canonical information which should have been stored from the beginning. Generation numbers are a result of the state of the tree, while timestamps are derived from the ambient (and potentially incorrect!) environment from which the commit was made.",1310708870

You can tell that they're derived information by the fact that you can compute them for old commits, long after commit time, which is exactly what part of this proposal is to do. You can derive them simply by counting the maximum number of steps between a commit and any of its roots. The essential information isn't the generation numbers; it's the structure of the commit history -- the actual chains of commits, with all of the branches and merges. Generation numbers are just an artifact of counting.<p>On the other hand, this information is very handy, once you have it, for certain algorithms, and it could be expensive to re-compute all the time, which is why the proposal is to generate and store them explicitly. (This is also the reason that timestamps have been used before, even if they were a bit of a hack -- they're readily available, and way faster than recomputing generation numbers all the time)",1310708581

I completely understand how frustrated you must feel.<p>Nick>
this the second most worst website i have seen in terms of user experience<p>Nick>
not only is it slow, but it doesn't tell me what i am paying for<p>Nick>
sure there is a round-about way....but thats not what i expect from comcast<p>Rachael>

well the site is slow from anywhere<p>Rachael>
I will need to transfer you to the internet department to help you with that issue.<p>Nick>

thanks Rachael, but its fine....i am also from the service industry and work with an engineering team and a customer service team<p>Nick>
and the first thing i would so is to give people the information about services that they pay for<p>Rachael>
Thank you for your time and patience with me, due to my scope and limitations here in my end, I do not know how to answer internet issues.<p>Nick>
i don't want them to call customer service or wait a month to see the update on their account<p>Rachael>
Do not worry, I will be happy to transfer you to the correct department, for your concern to be addressed immediately.<p>Rachael>
Yes, I understand that.<p>Rachael>
When I am not at work, I am a customer myself; I completely understand how frustrating it feels when things are not working the way they should be.<p>Nick>

The solution is simple: set things up so theyre not hard to remember. Again, there is no reason why your OpenID login cant be name.my-open-id-provider.com.<p>I would be willing to bet Google and Yahoo made their OpenID URLs hard to remember because they already had single sign on products that they wanted in the limelight preferentially over OpenID.

When I first looked at it in 2008, it was still in alpha. But it looked like having solid devs and good community behind it. So I jumped on it, built my site around it and even developed custom modules for it.<p>Fast forward to 2010. The project has forked and the main dev has gove over to develop the next generation of Drupal e-commerce system which is a completely separate project. It is only being developed for Drupal 7 and has no migration path from UC. I heard that someone from the original team is still continuing to work on Ubercart but the site has had no updates for about a year.<p>To put it in perspective, this leaves me with 2 options. One is to live with the old UC (which still lacked a lot of stuff since it was pretty much work in progress) and keep investing further in developing on it while knowing that underlying platform is dead. Or I can jump over to Drupal Commerce which would mean I would need to move to Drupal 7 which would mean porting all the rest of my custom development (which has nothing to do with e-commerce part) over to D7 which I had no need to! For those who do not know, Drupal does not maintain backward compatibility between major version upgrades.<p>Having said that, I don't have any gripes with UC devs. I have benefited from their hard work and thank them for that. I am just pointing out that even Drupal ecosystem is vulnerable to what the original article said.",1310706616

We should do the opposite.<p>Still, in 2003, ems might have been best practice. In the modern web, ems and pixels are equivalent when it comes to scaling. One shouldn't avoid a good tool because it's hard to learn. (Example: I use Vim for all my coding.) However, one shouldn't use a tool just because it's hard to learn. Ems, in my opinion, introduce bugs, make planning more complicated, and have no meaningful benefits.<p>Using ems is like avoiding functions and instead duplicating code everywhere it's needed. Ems behave differently depending on their scope, and they're a pain to keep track of.<p>There's a similar issue with percent-based sizing. Let's look at some css:<p>*{font-size: 75%}
h1{font-size: 125%;}<p>What size is h1? I honestly have no clue without a calculator. It almost definitely contains fractional pixel value. There's no way I'm getting appropriate vertical rhythm with percents. It's the same for ems.<p>I might be entirely wrong. Maybe I'd fall in love with ems if I started working with them regularly.

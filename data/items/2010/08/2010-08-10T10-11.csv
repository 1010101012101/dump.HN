Well the author of this article pretty much sums up that, if you walk in to class, try and be the person that doesn't think you are better than everyone else, and it forces you to study harder. I really like that article and i forgot to bookmark it. There were other useful things in that article and it would be really awesome if someone knew what article I'm talking about.<p>It's a small thing to ask, but any advice on how to get rid of this ""slacker"" mindset? So far reading articles on how to study helps, I just want to know if anyone here in HN ever got rid of their ""slacker"" mindset.<p>edit: forgot to mention, I am going into the Computer Science Program in my University.",1281437849

For example, the statement about God being able to do anything was clearly an allusion to the Philosopher's God (i.e., most agree that the Philosopher's God can perform any action which is logically possible). Similarly, the question about ""God exists. True/False"" is clearly designed to get someone to make a straight statement about the existence of God, which the only logical answer is ""unknown."" The question about moral justification in absence of a God is tricky, mainly because of the wording. The wording implies that there can be no moral system outside of a theological system. Technically, it's not that there is no moral system, but only that all moral systems are essentially equivalent in fundamental foundation. This is ideally trying to trap one in the same well that Kant fell into.",1281436328

The theory of computational complexity is about asymptotic results as the size of the instances goes to infinity and involves `there exists` statements whose meaning when applied to infinite sets is typically ambiguous. For instance, it turned out to be a matter of choice whether or not you want the set of all subsets of real numbers between zero and one to equal or to be strictly larger than the set of so called measurable sets. And whether or not a set is measurable can be characterized in a very concrete way about the possibility of approximating it by unions of intervals. So the question of whether or not there exist non measurable sets turned out to depend on `what you mean by set`in a way which people hadn´t thought about before. I suspect the question whether or not P is NP will depend on what we mean by P and NP in ways which so far no one thought about.",1281436189

Transaction fees seem insignificantly small, but they'll easily chew into any profit margin and more for a payment as small as €5 (<i>as small as</i>, not <i>less than</i>).

It is said that the etymology of the word 'sabotage' can be traced back to the Netherlands in the 15th century when workers would throw their sabots (wooden shoes) into the wooden gears of the textile looms to break the cogs, feeling the automated machines would render the human workers obsolete.  wikipedia also points out this is unverified...  however, workers fearing competition from machines is not a new thing.  sure, when the economy is good, everyone loves automation, as it tends to increase productivity and thus wages, and people who are automated away can be productively used elsewhere.  When the economy is shit, though, like it is now, people tend to fear and hate automation, because when the economy is shit, rather than driving up wages, the increased productivity just replaces the least-productive workers.<p>I mean, yeah, things are changing faster than they were before... but really, it's the same problem that the 15th century textile workers had.<p>As time goes on and our technology advances, yeah, more and more people are largely idle.

I mean, she paints (and her paintings are certainly very interesting)  and she makes expensive coffee for people, (and hey, I enjoy expensive coffee)  but my point is that she went to school for four years (and is now trying to get into graduate school)  studying for a job that nobody rationally expects to provide a comfortable living.  I'm not saying it's a bad choice... but if we did not have a whole lot of spare capacity, it wouldn't be a choice at all.<p>And hell, look at all the people in the advertising industry, convincing people to buy products they don't need.  There will be new industries in the future.<p>The retraining cycle is shorter than it has ever been before, true, but I think most of the problems we're seeing right now are because our economy is broken for other reasons, not because of the pace of productivity improvement.",1281435323

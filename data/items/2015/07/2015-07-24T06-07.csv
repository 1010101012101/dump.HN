Beacon can last many years on a single coin battery. It&#x27;s also way more power efficient for the phone to scan for beacons that GPS regions. Beacons have almost no impact on phone&#x27;s battery.<p>In addition it is important to remember that 80% of time people spend indoor when GPS doesn&#x27;t work, so that technology might be useful for indoor applications (e.g. museums, airports, retail, etc).",1437721056

Then you discard the water.  Next, using the palm of your hand you grind the rice in a circular motion.  You have to press quite hard because you are trying to polish the rice and remove any oxidized bran from the outside of each kernel.  This both improves the texture and flavour of the rice.  Finally, you fill up the bowl with water, stir and dispose of the cloudy water.  Repeat rinsing until the water is no longer cloudy.  The whole process takes about 5 minutes and a good 5-6 times the volume of rice in water.",1437721047

As a .NET developer, it&#x27;s always been unclear until a few years ago as to how you could get the free tools and what you could do with them.<p>I&#x27;m specifically talking about Visual Studio here.<p>So there was always this perceived barrier to entry, even if it wasn&#x27;t true -- for example with C++ I know I can just grab a linux box and have gcc and use it.  With .NET, until recently it was -- pay for Visual Studio? Use the free version but it&#x27;s only an express version so can I use it commercially? Use MonoDevelop which is alright but doesn&#x27;t feel quite as nice under Windows?<p>Now that we have an official toolset on Linux and the licensing behind Visual Studio seems a hell of a lot less confusing, I think we&#x27;ll see the community grow.<p>There is also the hate thing; but I&#x27;d counter that with the observation that there&#x27;s also a lot of Java-hate out there too.

Beyond a few boxes, the TCO of buying your own gear is far, far cheaper (look at the prices of Supermicro boxes, not luxury, overpriced enterprise boxes that aren&#x27;t use-case appropriate).<p>Someone also has to know how to negotiate with DC&#x27;s (because power circuits are often the biggest cost factor) and how to separately get good deals on fiber (which is usually far cheaper than the DC&#x27;s charges because most customers don&#x27;t know better).  DC&#x27;s often nickel and dime for simple tasks if you don&#x27;t do it yourself (or have hands that can do it for you).  (RackSpace used to charge something $75 every time a box need to be reimaged.  DC&#x27;s will often take forever and charge several arms and legs to rack & stack & cable in your cage, but you will still be at their mercy for freight & delivery and pulling outside fiber, electrical circuits, cooling & rack leveling.)<p>Overall though, it&#x27;s still cheaper for web-ops shops to do bare metal in (Google, Yahoo, Apple, etc. in their own DC&#x27;s and other large/medium shops with predictable baseline loads in someone else&#x27;s DC&#x27;s) otherwise <i>everyone would be using AWS</i>.  And that&#x27;s clearly not the case for anyone who&#x27;s ever been in a real enterprise shop.<p>Look at Wikia or most any other enterprise shop for baseline loads: mostly bare metal, because it&#x27;s far cheaper for people whom know what they&#x27;re doing.

9940441,comment,9935830,9937014,0,0,shoo,,,"At my last job we ported the build scripts to FAKE and afterwards many people (everyone?) felt that it had been a mistake. There were probably a few reasons for this:<p>1. we wanted to split the build scripts across multiple files, as we had multiple builds sharing common parts of a build process, and the only way of doing that with F# seemed to be writing a bunch of scripts that #load-ed each other. This was unpleasant.<p>2. at the time FAKE tried to kill processes it launched at the end of a build, but this was not implemented terribly well, so if you ran multiple FAKE builds in parallel on the same Windows box there was a fair chance they&#x27;d start trying to murder each other, and you&#x27;d end up having builds fail for no reason. This was fun to debug. IIRC FAKE was trying to track processes using process ids, but these get recycled...<p>3. we weren&#x27;t using F# for anything else in the business, so having the build scripts in F# meant even less people wanted anything to do with them.<p>Here&#x27;s a Q&A with myself that I wrote at the time about the #load-ing stuff:<p>Q1. do you recommend constructing build systems out of many .fsx scripts that #load each other?<p>A1. no. the #load mechanism of f# scripts is lamentable, in that it does not like you #load-ing something twice, yet no mechanism like #pragma once or #define / #ifndef is provided.<p>Q2. couldn&#x27;t you work around that problem by not making your &quot;library&quot; .fsx scripts #load anything, and write a top-level &quot;main&quot; .fsx script that #loads all transitive dependencies exactly once in the correct order?<p>A2. yes. yet that sounds strangely similar to what you might wish a build system to do for you.<p>edit: and now I&#x27;m reminded of something else, that isn&#x27;t to do with FAKE, just another fun windows parallel build interaction thing: you run a couple of builds on a windows box using jenkins. in each build, you use msbuild to compile some visual studio project. msbuild launches some mspdbsrv process that is cleverly shared between msbuild processes. then the first jenkins build finishes, and jenkins cleverly kills all processes launched by the build, including mspdbsrv, while the second build is still using it. hurray for interactions between two different pieces of clever software! at least this one is fixable by setting environment variables telling msbuild not to do this once you figure out what is going on.",1437720741

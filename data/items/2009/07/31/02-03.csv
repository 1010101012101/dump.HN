Right now, I can set it up by saying that domains ""*.xyz.com"" are local to my network, forcing everything else to go through the proxy.  If every location were an incomprehensible name (as you suggest), the only way to configure the server would be to list every obfuscated name.

733628,comment,733291,733291,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"Ok, this is my second alternative to the current domain name registration system.<p>All domains are sold for 1 year at a time.  At the end of each year, they are auctioned off to the highest bidder, with the exception of domains that are identical in name to a registered and established trademark, and is a .com (for for profit) or .org (for not-for-profit).  The net proceeds from the auction go to the previous holder of the domain.  If you hold a domain, and you win the bidding to keep it, that money goes to me in the form of walmart gift cards.<p>Ok, why do it like this?  Domain squatting becomes impossible.  Since the domains are re-sold every year in an auction, buying domains becomes like buying stock options.  Maybe you can make money on them, but you might lose money too, since there is no assurance that the bidder who wins one of your domains will bid as much as you did the previous year to get it.  Also, since domains are bid in an auction, you can't wait until there is interest in some domain and then squeeze someone for everything you can get.  If someone wants some domain you own, they bid for it.  Unless you or someone else is willing to pay more to keep it, they get it for what they bid for it.<p>If you have a trademark, you get to renew your domain that is identical in name to that trademark without bidding (you pay some fee, like is the current system).  However, you have to acquire the domain somehow.  If the car company wants nissan.com, they either have to convince the current owner to sell it to them, or they have to bid on it during it's yearly auction.<p>Ok, this makes it seem like the current owner of nissan.com is going to get screwed, since he can't pay as much as the car company is willing to bid.  However, nissan is likely to be willing to pay lots of money for that domain.  Other bidders also know the car company is willing to pay a lot for the domain, and would be willing to buy it and then hold it for a year or privately sell it to the car company.  However, nobody will pay more than they think they can get for it later.<p>This system is purely awesome.",1249007920

However, I think he's missing one important point.<p>Microsoft doesn't think ""it is sitting pretty because Best Buy has a 17-inch Dell for $650."" I can assure you that internal talks at Microsoft include very worried discussions about how they're going to deal with Apple's quickly growing market share.<p>Microsoft's response to ""Macs are better"" is ""PCs are cheaper"", not because they think more PCs will sell because of these ads, per se, but because <i>they want computers to be cheaper</i>. They want to frame the buying decision in terms of price so they can drive prices down further. Oddly enough, this kind of worked. Apple lowered their prices.<p>As Joel Spolsky says, ""Smart companies try to commoditize their products' complements... Microsoft's goal was to commoditize the PC market."" (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html</a>)<p>Microsoft does not think that it's OK to be inferior to Apple as long as they're cheaper. They just really really want computers to be cheaper. They always have. That's how they've made billions of dollars over the years. They tie the success of their software business directly to falling prices in the computer hardware industry. If they see any hint of that trend reversing (rising prices in hardware), they're going to fight it tooth and nail.<p>I think what they really need to understand is that the race to the bottom in the computer hardware market is generally over. We've arrived at (or near) the bottom. People can afford just about as many computers as they could possibly want now. If they want to further commoditize the personal computer, they should be doing what Google is doing and writing a stripped-down OS that runs on much weaker hardware but relies on the web for processing power. Insisting on machines that are both cheaper and more powerful than the PCs of yesteryear has reached the point of diminishing returns.",1249006247

I think there is a tremendous amount of neat hacks like this to be done with ever more available data.<p>To make it more than a 'fun experiment', you'd have to actually offer those kinds of terms.  Actually, what might be interesting is to see the difference between what people say they would accept, and what they would choose if they were getting a real offer.",1221306951

It seems just a few notches above email spam, but damn if $155k/mo profit isn't tempting. I can't see myself working so hard to pollute the internet, even if there is good money in it.

Their service is very geek friendly, and as a consequence is a geek favourite. Now they're disrupting mobile service, even if it's not going as smoothly as desired, they forced all the other network operators to offer lower prices.<p>I find it interesting they have a very entrepreneurial YAGNI and fake-it-till-you-make-it swagger.

I made an inquiry at Rackspace and the sales person was all over me for the transaction. Then I had questions about the AUP. The salesman responded with a 1 sentence answer which basically restated the AUP. I wrote back saying I already knew that and restated the questions. The salesman still hasn't (4 days later) written back. Even though the other questions were answered super promptly. Same day with gusto. (I don't expect I will hear back).  But I've received several canned emails pushing me on how easy it is to setup the account and get going!<p>To me that is a signal. He is all over us when he might get business.

Also, what kind of performance does this device offer? Given that it's inspecting every connection, this might put a limit on the throughput it can provide and/or add additional latency.

My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years. In recent years, a number of program analysers like PREfix and PREfast in Microsoft have been used to check references, and give warnings if there is a risk they may be non-null. More recent programming languages like Spec# have introduced declarations for non-null references. This is the solution, which I rejected in 1965.""",1352586101

4767930,comment,4767626,4767626,5,0,forgotusername,,,"Everyone bumps into this at some time on their journey through Python, however personally it's not something I've contended with in years and there is good reason for that:<p>> Suppose you have a function which takes a person and allows you to update the person's name, age, both, or neither<p>The problem is not the lack of some fundamental feature, it is one of obviousness in interface design. A trixy interface as given by the example leads exactly to the kind of problems the library hopes to eliminate. Instead how about:<p><pre><code>    def update(person, attrs):
        pass

    def update_with_email(person, attrs):
        update(person, attrs)
        send_email(person)
</code></pre>
Not only is the problem avoided, but a problem of namespace pollution has been fixed too. Overusing keyword arguments in a hyper-generic manner forces extension of the code to require definition of a new function in order to avoid potential breakage.<p>For example, how does one add a 'use_html=True' parameter to update_with_email()? Perhaps by adding a 'use_html' kwarg that hopefully doesn't conflict with Person's attribute namespace, or perhaps by adding '_use_html', hoping to skirt the problem by introduction of ugliness. For a 'clean' backwards-compatible solution, we're forced into something like:<p><pre><code>    def _real_update_with_email(person, use_html, kwargs):
        update(person, **kwargs)
        send_email(person, use_html=use_html)

    def update_with_email(person, **kwargs):
        _real_update_with_email(person, False, kwargs)

    def update_with_html_email(person, **kwargs):
        _real_update_with_email(person, True, kwargs)
</code></pre>
How can the caller dynamically form the attribute names if they need to?<p><pre><code>    # TODO: something seems terribly wrong here, I can't quite put my finger on it.
    update(person, **{'previous_' + attr: value})
</code></pre>
etc.<p>I realize abuse of \* \* is very much a religious issue, and at first sight, one of the superficial attractions to Python (at least for me, way back in time), however with experience it seems to regularly introduce more problems than it solves outside a few niche uses. The idea of adding an 'undefined' value has been discussed going back years (try grepping python-ideas and python-dev) and it's never made it in for good reason.<p>There is one place where an 'undefined' might seem useful at first, for example in the implementation of `dict.pop()` where a missing second argument signals the need to raise KeyError. The problem is that no published, public value including 'undefined' can be used as placeholder without introducing another ugly rule to the language: the ability to use `pop(..., default)` with any default value except 'undefined'! (net simplicity gain: zero)",1352585921

That is because ""you"" are too cheap to pay what ""we"" think should be paid for them. It is like a hotel which sells you room for $100 a night if you agree to let them leave a web cam on 24/7 and sell any useful 'snippets' it catches while you are there.<p>The bulk of the market doesn't buy ""computers"" they buy ""televisions."" Think about that for a minute.<p>The bulk of the market are entertainment 'consumers' for which you can sell access to their eyeballs for real money. Just like TV did before people got digital recorders and started skipping all the ads. Not so with these new fangled TVs, they don't care if you don't <i>look</i> at their advertising they want to know what you did look at, and when, and after what, and then what did you do? Because all of that is much more valuable than putting up a tasty picture of a cheeseburger in front of you, no, they can phone ahead to your local market and tell them to stock up on cheeseburgers because you've been researching them all day and are now at the point where you want to make a purchase.<p>But the cool thing? It means that the current 'big' players are leaving the market for computers behind. You can tell that by the fact that the computer company no longer sells a product that a <i>developer</i> would care to use. And that means that there is room again at the bottom.<p>Time to start a 'developers' company that works very much on the same model that Sun Microsystems started on, hardware designed from the ground up to be developed on, open systems so that folks can easily work with it, and a team dedicated to making sure integration and support is there so that folks like you and I can say ""Hey this audio doesn't work when you set the sampling rate to 40Khz"" and they can fix it and release that fix.<p>But for that company to exist, you have to pay for the products you use, and to get to that point you have to not be able to get something 'good enough' by hacking and slashing something else into shape.",1352585697

It says ""On the way, a car suddenly stopped on the road. To avoid a collision, Daniel tried to dodge the car, which then collided with a truck"".<p>I don't think you can infer from this who was at fault. If that car ahead was traveling in the same direction as he was before it stopped, then in many jurisdictions he would be at fault for following too close. You are supposed to stay far enough behind to stop safely no matter what the car ahead of you does.<p>It is odd that it would take this long for them to come after him, though, if that is what it is about. It usually doesn't take long in this kind of accident to figure out who is at fault and whether or not an arrest is warranted.<p>My guess is that it will turn out it is just a mistake. I'd expect that they were told not to leave the country until the investigation was complete, and due to some error (maybe on the police's part, maybe on their part), either they or the police ended up with a wrong notion of whether or not the travel restriction had ended. Result: they ended up leaving the country while the police thought they were still under orders to stay, and so they got reported to Interpol as fugitives.",1352585531

4767909,comment,4767418,4767797,8,0,rubyrescue,,,"So I don't know the situation but as an American living in Argentina for 5 years I can say a few things about how traffic accidents work here.<p>So, say you are making a legal left turn on a one-way street, onto another one way street, and a motorcycle flys around you ON THE LEFT from behind and doesn't see you turning, and plows into you. (Incidentally, all motorcycle drivers do this here - if you visit, don't drive until you understand the alternate ""physics"" of driving in South America.) In this case, even though you were in front, you signaled, you were in the leftmost lane, etc, a number of things will happen in the resulting police investigation and inevitable court cases (remember i'm sort of 'americanizing' the situation - the exact law and actors are slightly different but this is essentially what happens):<p>First, you <i>will</i> get sued by the motorcycle driver in civil court for multiple hundreds of thousands of pesos, probably at least $150k US. Second, you will get sued in criminal court (possibly by the ""DA"") with a crime - in fact it's possible both of you will, but let's assume in this case you have a job as a software developer like Daniel and the other guy is working for much less. In this case the suing will be mostly from the low-wage earner to (potential) high-wage earner. It is a near-guarantee, that though the high-wage earner did not do anything wrong, they or their insurance will pay a significant amount of money to the low-wage earner to settle the civil case. The fact of the matter is IT DOES NOT MATTER what happened in the actual traffic accident - it DOES NOT MATTER if you were or weren't at fault.<p>Now the cases will take possibly a year or longer and that means while they're going on, you're essentially an indicted criminal with multiple cases hanging over your head. If you travel or leave the country, etc, you may have a hard time - if you're an Argentine - leaving. I know people who have had to get a judge's permission to travel in this situation.<p>It's very possible, in fact, likely that the detritus of these court cases is hanging around and it has NOTHING to do with anything that David did, but the bureaucracy of Argentina sort of 'caught up' with him here in an odd way. Thank God they move so slowly most of the time - the number of absurd Kafkaesque situations like this is immense here mitigated mostly by institutional inefficiencies.

Maybe it'll be of some use or inspiration to someone.<p>There a lot of cruft in those examples, but in practical usage, everything but your blocking calls would be hidden behind libraries.

Or read the summary on Wikipedia.

Geeks spend inordinate amounts of money on fancy TV's, DVR's, portable media players, etc, just to consume this content. They could get a bunch of classic movies on DVD for $1.99 a pop, but that's not in HD 3D with surround sound so they don't. They masturbate over all this content consumption technology, then get upset when content producers correctly gauge that they are willing to pay out the nose for content to use on it.",1352584819

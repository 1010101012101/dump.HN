Many criminal laws <i>do not</i> have intent requirements -- requiring only recklessness or negligence, for instance -- and some are strict liability (requiring only that the prohibited act be done, independent of mental state.)<p>> and honest mistakes usually don&#x27;t clear the bar for criminal culpability.<p>Honest, but unreasonable, mistakes can clear the bar for crimes with recklessness or negligence requirements rather than intent requirements, and honest <i>and reasonable</i> mistakes do so for ones that are of the strict liability type.",1425344374

There are so many tools we can&#x27;t use without modifications. Some examples:<p>Varnish. POST responses do not have cache control of etag or last modified. Nothings stopping you from adding them, but without guarantees no general purpose tool is going to look at them. For our larger datasets, serving from a fast cache is going to make a world of difference.<p>Shadow. <a href=""https://github.com/twilio/shadow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twilio/shadow</a> Twilio built this out for their billing system as they migrated to a new platform. It only works with idempotent requests (basically everything but POST). It executes the request on both the new system and the old system and compares the output.<p>The proposed solution here is one I&#x27;ve pondered quite a bit. Making all large queries into two requests would help a lot. The first request is a PUT and returns a URI to a new resource. The second request is a GET.<p>For large queries with significant payloads, two queries that result in a 304 is well worth the cost. The point of a 304 is to reduce data transfer (as well as cost of generating a response). The new resource URI does not need to be stored indefinitely. It&#x27;s a time sensitive URI.<p>All that said, I haven&#x27;t gone that route yet. It&#x27;s too new, too &quot;unique snowflake&quot;. The old _method=get approach with a POST is going to be understood by all (even if it makes many people cringe).",1425344373

There are definitely historical examples in which the majority of experts was wrong.<p>I also find it incredibly difficult to tell what is missing about an algorithm. Perhaps multiple breakthroughs are necessary, perhaps just one (there is no good reason to believe that an algorithm that yields AGI can&#x27;t be considerably simpler than what happens in the human brain).

9135478,comment,9132843,9135139,0,0,gizmo,,,"I agree that the author seems very nonchalant about this. He made rookie mistakes that were completely unnecessary. The project was essentially dead from the get-go because they had no idea how much money they needed to raise. The financial projections were comical. Thinking 500k is an nearly unlimited amount of money is shockingly naive for somebody who already has 5 people on the payroll from their existing business.<p>That said I think some perspective is necessary. Businesses of any size squander money every day of the year. So does the government, obviously. When a billion dollar business squanders $100M on a boneheaded idea nobody blinks an eye. Even though that money could have gone to employees or shareholders. When government projects go way over budget we don&#x27;t care, because it&#x27;s par for the course. It&#x27;s only when tiny 5 people shops mess up that we become judgmental. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right.<p>Squandering 500k is bad, but the 2008 crisis wiped away <i>trillions</i>.

9135473,comment,9134734,9134734,0,0,vonnik,,,"Contributor to Deeplearning4j here.<p>I deeply disagree with Sam’s assessment of the dangers of SMI and his prescriptions to regulate it.<p>1) In our lifetimes, humanity is much more likely to damage itself through anthropogenic climate change and nuclear disasters both deliberate and accidental than it is vulnerable to the development of SMI. If anything, machine intelligence will probably allow us to approach those other significant problems more effectively.<p>2) For regulatory limits on the progress and use of technology to be effective, the rules must be global, and the technology must be detectable. Neither of those conditions is likely to be fulfilled in this situation. Any law that requires the agreement of and enforcement by every nation in the world fails before it is even formulated. Humanity has shown very little capacity to agree on a global scale. The proliferation of nuclear arms and the persistence of human trafficking are two cases in point.<p>3) Unlike nuclear testing, the development of SMI would not be detectable with Geiger counters. It does not produce explosions that are seismologically measurable half a planet away.<p>While the US should incentivize the “right” research into machine intelligence through financing and other means, onerous regulations and absurd government bodies will simply shift research offshore to other countries looking for an edge. (Machine learning research does not require large facilities. All you need is a keyboard and the cloud.) That offshoring would be disastrous for the United States, because our competitive advantage in the world economy is technological innovation.<p>At the same time, regulation by slow-moving committees will simply drive military/intelligence research underground. I doubt the three-letter agencies will acquiesce to a law that puts them at a disadvantage to their peers.<p>In other words, if SMI is possible, then it is inevitable. It will be put to many uses, like all technology. If we are technological liberals at all, then we must trust that the positive affects of machine intelligence, on balance, will outweigh the negative ones. We should not be the ones sowing fear.",1425344026

9135469,comment,9134829,9135395,0,0,toki5,,,"The legal answer to your question is that they reserve the right to refund your ticket at any time up to the point of you actually being in the air. Buying a product at a retailer, where your interaction ends when they hand you a receipt, isn&#x27;t really the same. The comparison would be better if United had tried to charge consumers <i>after the flight</i>. The real question, if you want to use the Rite-Aid example, is &quot;should the employee be allowed to investigate the $1 price tag upon seeing it rung up,&quot; and yes, in my opinion, they absolutely should.<p>That gets to the moral answer, which I think is what you&#x27;re really asking, I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that black and white. From the perspective of a business, there are two phases to this mistake, right? The first is letting them buy a ticket; the second is honoring that ticket. The first part doesn&#x27;t hurt; the second hurts a lot. If I can catch that mistake before the second phase, why shouldn&#x27;t I? Maybe I&#x27;ll lose some customers who are genuinely upset that they couldn&#x27;t take advantage of a bug in my software, but in the long run, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s harmful.<p>Meanwhile, from a consumer standpoint, as someone who has -- many times -- bought things at a premium discount because of a bug in software (preorder costs for video games are especially vulnerable to this), each and every time I make that purchase, I&#x27;m willing to accept that if they catch it before they ship it and want to refund me the discounted purchase price, fine.

A brain, no matter how big or how fast, does not become intelligent until it learns. In humans, learning is a slow process requiring practice, repetition and study over many years. Unlike humans, intelligent machines can be cloned, transferring the learning from one machine to a new one, eliminating the learning time. However, for an intelligent machine to discover new truths, to learn new skills, to extend knowledge beyond what has been achieved before, it will need to go through the same difficult and slow discovery process humans do. Yes, an intelligent machine could think much faster than a biological brain, but the slower process of discovery still has to occur.&quot;<p>The person writing this fails to understand the difference between engineering and biological evolution. The AI would be engineered to begin with. There would be nothing haphazard or extraneous about its design. The &quot;slow process of discovery&quot; would be bootstrapped, as stated, by &quot;cloning&quot; (copying extremely fast memory compared with humans). Then, the AI would attack new problems with very likely a minimum 100-1 speed advantage over humans, based on electronic versus chemical speeds. Nerve impulses travel at well less than 100 miles per hour, versus the over 150,000 miles per second of electronic impulses.<p>Consider a first-gen AI engineer, with &quot;only&quot; a 150 IQ human equivalent intelligence, attempting to design a better AI. Such an AI would have no distractions (food, sleep or sex) and would likely have a monomaniacal focus on its job. It would have a perfect, near-instantaneous memory of arbitrary size (we can already do this). I expect it would in fairly short order produce an IQ 300 version of itself, and that that cycle would likely continue.<p>That is the basis for the idea of the &quot;singularity&quot;, and I find it completely believable. What it would mean, I don&#x27;t know...and neither does anyone else. We have the same relationship to an IQ 1000 AI that a chimp has with us.<p>That is the concern that Musk, Hawking and others share.",1425342880

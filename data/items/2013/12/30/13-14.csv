Space at the top is NOT limited. Total wealth is NOT limited. Anybody who works hard (and smart!) can get there.<p>This is false. The USA has a very low rate of mobility between economic classes when compared to other first-world nations.<p>>42 percent of American men raised in the bottom fifth of incomes stay there as adults. That shows a level of persistent disadvantage much higher than in Denmark (25 percent) and Britain (30 percent) â€” a country famous for its class constraints.<p>>Meanwhile, just 8 percent of American men at the bottom rose to the top fifth. That compares with 12 percent of the British and 14 percent of the Danes.<p><a href""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to-rise-from-lower-rungs.html?sq=mobility&st=cse&scp=1&pagewanted=all&_r="" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to...</a>",1388411997

I would love to have a stable ipv6 connection, with a permanent prefix (permanent for the duration of the contract with the ISP, bonus points for the ability to keep my prefix between different providers). I would gladly play with the ipv6 world while ipv4 still works decently (dual stack, sans lite). Accessing ipv6 services from most networks is crap, especially so from mobile devices. Random trivia: The Android emulator doesn&#x27;t support ipv6...<p>The way I see (and experience) it, ipv6 is a pita right now and with introductions like the one I see here personal resistance will go up, not down. I contemplate to change the ISP solely to leave ipv6 behind - and I WANT to like it, dabbled with ipv6 tunnels in the past and like to tinker with networks.",1388411631

Twitter is appealing because of its brevity, not merely because it lets people send messages without specifying a recipient.  Email is appealing because humans can read the addresses, and because it has a &quot;subject&quot; line for humans to read.  Etc.

6984446,comment,6984254,6984363,3,0,sillysaurus2,,,"One reason I haven&#x27;t learned anything about IPv6 is because of how ugly the new format is.  It&#x27;s 128 bits divided into &quot;48 bits for routing prefix, 16 bits for subnet id, and 64 bits for interface number.&quot;  But the preferred encoding for such a thing is hex, meaning it winds up looking like 2001:0DB8:AC10:FE01::  (the interface number is omitted here, as is allowed by the protocol.)  Compare that to an IPv4 address like &quot;99.231.39.210&quot; from the standpoint of visual appeal...<p>I don&#x27;t have a point.  Visual appeal isn&#x27;t really a valid reason to dislike a design. Neither v6 nor v4 are &quot;easy for humans.&quot;  I&#x27;m pretty sure my illogical prejudice might be due to me growing up with IPv4 and never knowing anything else.  Also IPv4 superficially resembles a phone number, which are quite comfortable for humans.  So the fact that an IPv6 address contains so many more symbols than an IPv4 address is ... a little jarring.  I know for a fact that I can instantly discern between IPv4 addresses (e.g. in log files or any other list) and tend to notice ones I&#x27;ve seen before based on their &quot;shape&quot; (like &quot;8.8.193.39&quot; has a totally different shape from &quot;285.89.15.232&quot;) but IPv6 addresses are all visually uniform so it&#x27;s much harder to recognize addresses you&#x27;ve seen before.  This, again, doesn&#x27;t really matter very much... What are the chances I&#x27;m going to be visually noticing oddities in lists of IP addresses? ... but it was kind of a nice feature.<p>Couldn&#x27;t the first 64 bits of IPv6 addresses be encoded with a-z and 0-9, like domain names?  Having a-z and 0-9 means there are 37 possibilities, and log(37^13)/log(2) is 68, meaning 13 a-z0-9 characters are sufficient to encode any 64-bit number.  That way, IPv6 addresses would look like &quot;d1mfx888qgnf3&quot; or &quot;fxyotvii435fb&quot;.  That seems way less jarring of a transition than &quot;2001:0DB8:AC10:FE01::&quot; and it seems easier for people to remember 13 random [a-z0-9] chars than 16 random [A-F0-9] chars.<p>I mean, obviously this is all moot; the protocols probably won&#x27;t ever change.  I just wish some extra thought had been put into making IPv6 pleasant.  I&#x27;ve only ever heard people complain about IPv6... no one seems to love it, which is generally a bad sign in a new design.  On the other hand, the world will probably need IPv6 pretty soon, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s pleasing.  It would&#x27;ve helped its adoption rate, though.<p>Of course, the most obvious reason I&#x27;ve learned nothing about IPv6 is because IPv4 still works, and I have more important things to learn.  Whenever IPv4 stops working, everyone will be forced to learn IPv6 regardless of how painful it is.  I wonder when that will be?",1388409264

It took a further several years before his party added &quot;Socialist&quot; to his name, and officially started adopting Soviet terminology.<p>Similarly, Ho-Chi-Mihn was a nationalist first, who looked to the US as a model for Vietnamese independence, and who appealed to Woodrow Wilson for support for Vietnamese independence.<p>It was first when this failed that Ho was radicalised further, but even then he largely held on to a nationalist outlook for a long time, while turning to socialist groups for support. Despite his radicalisation, which eventually lead to becoming one of the founder of the French communist party, and an official of the Comintern, during World War II he was supported by the US OSS in fighting the Vichy French and Japanese occupation forces.<p>But after the war, US support again disappeared when France attempted to re-occupy the country, and he saw no other alternative but to expand warfare and eventually fight those he originally hoped would be the guarantors of a free, independent Vietnam,.<p>This is a common thread with <i>many</i> of the revolutionary groups over the last century, who have first turned to the US or other democratic countries for support, found that they as groups are &quot;inconvenient&quot; because the dictatorships they oppose or opposed were often considered safer partners, and who have then instead turned elsewhere.<p>You even see it with the ANC in South Africa, which had an extremely tight relationship with the SACP (South African Communist Party) that deepened as Cuba provided assistance as well as intervened militarily in the South African puppet states of Angola and Namibia. ANC received support from that camp for decades while the West still provided extensive support and/or trade to the Apartheid regime. It would not have taken much for SA to have ended up taking a similar turn to Cuba or Vietnam.<p>A vast number of these regimes would either have looked very different, or even been open to extensive concessions to the West if &quot;our&quot; governments had been at all concerned with supporting democracy movements rather than propping up convenient trading partners or regimes they saw as strategic partners against the Soviets or Chinese.",1388408822

One thing you need to think about with college is student loan debt. Some can go through without loans but many can not. So you need to not only work hard, but also to network hard so that you can get a good enough job that will allow you to pay back the loans without destroying your standard of living.<p>Beyond that, college offers many opportunities such as making friendships, meeting people from other countries and having access to vast stores of information and industry professionals. This is something that is difficult to duplicate simply by striking out on your own. Possible, but difficult.<p>It&#x27;s true that some people simply don&#x27;t need to go to college.  They are already emotionally and intellectually mature enough to enter the world of business. But you must realize that they are the minority. Not everyone can be Steve Jobs.<p>Personally, I didn&#x27;t drop out. But I did take several years off between high school and college. I worked one awesome job until it went out of business. Then I tried freelancing but I just didn&#x27;t have the technical ability nor the salesmanship to make any money. During undergrad I continued freelancing on and off but I got burned by more clients than I actually got paid by. During my master&#x27;s though I worked for the university on several great projects and that allowed me to have an awesome resume. Then it pretty much started raining jobs. By the end of my coursework I was working 3 jobs and I ended up killing my 4.0 and graduated with a 3.9 (I may never get over the shame).<p>Now I am qualified, have a track record of success, and above all else have the confidence to sell myself and my abilities.

You can do multithreaded code in C the way you can do structured programming in BASIC (or do OO in plain C): it&#x27;s possible, because the language is TÃ¼ring-complete and the required primitives are there, but the language is so unhelpful that it simply doesn&#x27;t scale, and the only sane thing to do is to try and avoid doing it as far as possible.<p>(I don&#x27;t mention C++, because it sucks as a high perf solution in the hands of the C++ programmers you can effectively hire: cf. e.g. <a href""http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linu"" rel""nofollo"">http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus</a>)<p>Hence I&#x27;m more than puzzled that M# design doesn&#x27;t seem centered on multi-core exploitation, including GPUs.

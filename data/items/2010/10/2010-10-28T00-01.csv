1841190,comment,1840774,1841057,0,0,cs_loser,,,"Were I asked this, my general approach would be: (1) Given the available building blocks (disks, ram, cpus, etc) what strategies are workable?  An example of a strategy would be ""store it in a btree and keep all but the last two levels in ram; therefore we'll need enough ram for the top of the tree and 2x seeks for each lookup.""  (2) Find existing software that implements a workable strategy if at all possible, or at least the complicated components of it and code the rest yourself.<p>You can think of two extreme answers to this as ""buy oracle"" and ""buy some transistors"".  Those are both bad answers.  The first is a bad answer because, unless the candidate can answer the follow-up question ""how does oracle work?"" it probably just amounts to wishful thinking and they almost certainly won't be able to say when it will fail.  The second is a bad answer because you can't do that in two weeks by yourself.<p>Take for example, Foursquare's recent outage.  From what I read online, it seems like they went with ""use MongoDB"" as a strategy without actually understanding what Mongo was doing under the hood.  Presumably they didn't figure out how it would fail (the author's follow-up question, natch) and thus they discovered that the hard way.  So they chose bad answer one.  On the other hand, had they decided to implement their own database, they'd know all about its characteristics, but they wouldn't have launched yet.",1288227550

These are two completely different issues, and articles with things like ""300 GHZ!"" in the headlines often play off this confusion to get page views.<p>There are already transistors which can switch at much higher frequencies. They're mainly used in radio communications. The promise of graphene semiconductors is that they may be a way of replacing or supplementing silicon, so it's nice that graphene transistors are turning out to have good performance, but the really big issue continues to be figuring out how to mass-produce non-trivial devices.

I spend a lot of time looking at restaurant businesses and they tend to have managers that make the same mistakes over and over.<p>Here's one of my favorite restaurant turnaround stories. This is probably not applicable to your problem, but I like telling it:<p>A couple of years ago Steak N Shake (a fast food hamburger chain) was on the brink of bankruptcy because starting in 2002 or so, the management team decided to take on debt and rapidly expand their store-base. So they entered into markets where there was not enough demand for their products and in order to keep up with interest payments, they began raising the prices on all their menu items.<p>When the recession hit, the sales volume plummeted (for good reason - even though people liked the food, it was costing too much for them). The management team was in a tough spot because if the company could not pay, they would have to file for bankruptcy.<p>So they allowed a guy named Sardar Biglari (30 year old from San Antonio, TX) to take control of the company. He started a hedge fund right after graduating from undergrad (sold an ISP he founded back then near the top of the dot com bubble).<p>Biglari came in and tried to find ways to lower the prices of the menu items in order to increase sales volume and store traffic.<p>He changed a lot of little things which had inconsequential impacts on taste. He opted for a different kind of styrofoam cup which cost less money, switched from grape to sliced tomatoes in salads (salad sales were very low anyway), picked a different (cheaper) type of napkin they gave, and was able to reduce expenses overall by cutting costs in areas where most people didn't notice. Then he lowered prices a little bit and used coupons to increase traffic, while reminding people why they like the brand so much.<p>In addition he reduced management salaries and paired the menu down to items where they felt they had an advantage and sold well (do less, but make it your best).<p>They sold off some of their unprofitable locations and redirected cash flow to completely pay off their debt. The company never had to file for bankruptcy and performs well now.",1288225970

I (used to) do some hacking (building web sites, wordpress themes, html, css, js) on the side. Started as a hobby that could help me make money in HS, and it picked up from there. I made some money, and I guess got high headed. This is a throwaway account, but I have been on HN for a while (1.5 yr+). Its a great community and a lot of what I have learned here has proven really helpful. I have read a fair share of posts from people that are in situations not as great as mine who have asked for help, advice, about life/depression/suicide, to whatnot. I have benefited a lot from some of the advice that has been doled out to introverts.<p>Back in school I thought I knew what I wanted to do, but now I am utterly clueless. I interned for a big company last summer, and utterly hated the experience, so much that I quit 5 weeks into the 10 week program. I was just uncomfortable with the whole experience, and I was very self conscious all the time, even though, I was working more efficiently, and delivering better work than my co-interns. (not to sound cocky, but true).<p>Here is my problem. I am a junior in college now, and I have no idea with regards to what I want to do. I have lost interest in classes (this actually happened a while back), but I do not want to/ cannot drop out, because I have no clue as to what I would do, so basically I am just dragging through school, and it all seems kinda pointless. I am Indian (expected to take care of my parents, sister, and be a responsible son) so a lot is expected of me, another reason that I cannot quit school. I haven't really been able to talk to my parents, and such about all of this, and other than that I am an introvert, and don't have much friends that I can talk to. I have a few friends in college from clubs, etc. but that is it, and I liked spending time alone, but now every-time I am by myself, I keep thinking about all of this ^^. that I have no freaking clue as to what I am doing with my life, and am essentially bleeding time. I do not enjoy my major, and my self esteem / self worth is at an all time low. I guess I could say that I am even losing all motivation to go to classes, and that isn't helping either. I run / workout for 45-60 minutes everyday, and that is the highlight of my day, because for a while I am able to feel good, but then this whole viscous cycle kicks in.<p>I have been to the college counseling center and that wasn't much help either because the lady I talked to the first time was just either stupid or trying to just waste my time. It wasn't beneficial, so I did repeat this process again with some other counselor, and though he was better, his suggestions still didn't help much. He suggested that I join the group counseling for international students, which was an utter waste of time.<p>Thing is that I am in control of most of my actions, just that my motivation is not there to kick in when I start to lose the grip on the situation, and start reassessing myself, and start the process of re-evaluating what I need to do. I don't know whether something is wrong with me, or whether this is something that is part of the process of entering adulthood, but life is in utter chaos, and I could use some advice/help. If you have been in a similar situation, or could help me figure out a process to get my life back on track, I would really appreciate it.<p>Thanks in anticipation.<p>*throwaway account<p>EDIT: US College",1288224668

1841057,comment,1840774,1840774,0,0,barrkel,,,"I'm interested in why he's so against the ""custom solution"". Almost everything a DB will try and add in for key-value lookup is predicated on the idea that the requests aren't randomly distributed. The DB index will probably be based around b-trees, which will do a logarithmic-time search for the top few levels cached in RAM, but will fall over fairly miserably with multiple seeks as it has to page in leaf nodes and likely the nodes a level above those: I don't see it as realistic to expect a DB to do it all in a single seek.<p>On the other hand, if you have a perfect hash function for the keyspace into a hash addressing space (you'll want something a bit larger than 2^32), you could simply choose the device with the first few bits, then do a single seek into a (large) file on disk with the position indicated by the remaining bits of the hash addressing space, shifted over appropriately for the 128-byte stride of values. You don't even need a perfect hash: with a merely good hash function, you can cheaply read in more than 128 bytes from disk (OS will probably be reading in 4K anyhow), and use open addressing with linear probing.<p>You'll need enough devices to spread the load to get good latency for random seeks; probably a combination of mirroring and what amounts to sharding, using a portion of the key hash to select the device. But that's a relatively cheap numbers game.<p>But I'm not really seeing what a DB buys you here, in this specific scenario.<p>EDIT: Further investigation of tc and cdb (as linked in the article) suggests that tc (Tokyo Cabinet) may work in its hash form, but I'd rule out cdb for using two seeks, which I would expect to double the number of devices required.",1288224533

My actual project does not involve NLP directly, but all the 'related research' does (ie. all previous systems which achieve the same goal as mine)so I had to read up on it. This was a struggle... YMMV. I find a few good resources along the way though - recommend reading this first

then on iTunesU/YouTube you'll find a good course on computational linguistics from MIT, watch the first half dozen lectures at least (don't worry if you don't fully understand them all). A lot of the theory can be traced back to Chomsky's work on grammars, so I suggest reading some of his papers (his style is quite clear). I found I needed to do all this just so I could properly follow the recent papers on NLP (specifically NL interfaces to DBs) that I must review. I really had to start from the beginning, light wikipedia'ing wasn't cutting it. I'm currently reading The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics to consolidate my knowledge, it's pretty good.<p>So anyway... tough subject, try not to get bogged down. If all the reading's too dry, then 'Godel Escher Bach' is a fun alternative that touches on similar theory.<p>If I were to choose a pure NLP project myself, I'd maybe do something like 'How NLP can add value to existing systems/software.' ie. look for imaginative practical applications, rather than theorizing yet another parser with some new trick/quirk",1288224297

SSDs make seeks (almost) free, so even one decent SSD should be able to service 5000 requests per second, assuming you can get a big enough one.<p>If multiple storage devices (hard disks or otherwise) are allowed, RAID (or just splitting the data across multiple disks) would ameliorate the seek problem somewhat, since seeks can then happen in parallel.  I wouldn't see this problem as requiring a distributed solution, unless the bottleneck is the bus or storage controller rather than the single-disk seek performance.",1288224099

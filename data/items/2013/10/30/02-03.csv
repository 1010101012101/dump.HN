Clearly, the browser already requires crypto to function. Why can&#x27;t we standardize a way to access it from the runtime <i>and</i> provide a way to run code against it in a sandbox that would be impervious to things like wrapping one JS function in another?<p>On top of that we would need some code delivery system with built-in trust verification. This way you could load an up to date copy of PGP written in JS and verify that this code comes from a source you trust.<p>Then again, this is starting to look a lot like a secure package management system and downloaded software vs the continuously updated web apps we have today, so it might not be worth reinventing the wheel...",1383101815

6639153,comment,6636811,6637783,3,0,ubernostrum,,,"I often point out in aviation-related threads the striking difference between aircraft engineering in the past and today.<p>In 1989, a DC-10 operating United flight 232 suffered an uncontained engine failure which damaged the tail and disabled flight controls, resulting in 111 deaths (and could have been more, but in a freak of chance, a DC-10 flight instructor was on board and was able to assist the crew in landing, which may have made the difference for the other 185 people on board). In 2010, an Airbus A380 operating Qantas flight 32 suffered an uncontained engine failure which damaged a wing, disabled a hydraulic system and braking systems, and disabled some flight controls while starting a fire. It resulted in... zero deaths.<p>In the early 1990s, Boeing 737-200 and 737-300 aircraft had a variety of uncommanded rudder movement issues, resulting in at least 157 deaths. In 2012-2013, the 787&#x27;s battery fires resulted in... zero deaths.<p>In other words, the main difference between &quot;then&quot; and &quot;now&quot; is exactly the opposite of the usual arguments against modern aircraft development: more recent aircraft, when they have serious issues, result in <i>fewer</i> injuries and deaths than older aircraft when they experienced serious issues.<p>This track record of improvement gives justifiable faith that modern aircraft development is safer.",1383101698

The amount of overhead and false incentives such a nationalized or semi-nationalized health care system generates truly paralyzes - not just the economy at large. You can get pretty decent prices for medical treatments in the US, but you always have to ask and price shop. Certain things seem more expensive then elsewhere. It&#x27;s interesting to note how the great quality and extreme competition of dental care providers in former Eastern European countries have driven price down. Many people living in the neighboring socialized welfare funded health care systems take a bus/plane and get their teeth fixed in the &quot;capitalist&quot; alternative in the former communist countries.

Not too long ago, you could get a job just having experience in one/a few language(s) with a few things in a portfolio.<p>As a guy who&#x27;s always looking for advice on getting an entry-level position, I&#x27;ve been told to learn a dozen or so technologies before applying for a junior position: HTML, CSS, JS, Python/Django||Ruby/Rails||PHP, Linux, Data Structures and Algorithms, Photoshop, Design Principles. I also need to have some good quality projects and approach hard problems, which can be time-consuming and difficult on your own. Even then, some places filter out candidates who don&#x27;t have a CompSci degree.<p>To me, this seems a little high for a junior position (Any company, not Google) and sounds more like a full-stack web developer (I&#x27;m just shooting for a Front End spot). With no professional experience, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to be proficient in all of those domains unless I spend a long time learning on my own and that doesn&#x27;t exactly pay the bills.<p>As the problems get harder and more people drift towards CompSci, the requirements for even a minimum-level position will continue to increase, while the time to learn all of the requirements remains the same. This will hurt the talent pool in the long run, although people that have been riding the wave will command very large salaries if the talent gap continues to widen.",1383101568

Any computer control of the flight control systems (such as the autopilot) can be quickly locked out by the pilot who then reverts to manual control.<p>The computer control systems were dual, meaning two independent computer boards. The boards were designed independently, had different CPU architectures on board, were programmed in different languages, were developed by different teams, the algorithms used were different, and a third group would check that there was no inadvertent similarity.<p>An electronic comparator compared the results of the boards, and if they differed, automatically locked out both and alerted the pilot. And oh yea, there were dual comparators, and either one could lock them out.<p>This was pretty much standard practice at the time.<p>Note the complete lack of &quot;we can write software that won&#x27;t fail!&quot; nonsense.

6639039,comment,6637919,6637919,11,0,antics,,,"Almost a year ago to the day, The Economist ran a leader ([1], also cited at the bottom of the OP) that described itself as &quot;radical centerist&quot;, blatantly &quot;stealing&quot; ideas from both right and left. The surprisingly poor article posted here not only fails to clarify or improve this position, but actually muddies the waters of discourse, because it fails to spell out what it means when it uses terms like &quot;left-wing&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot;. These definitions are particular and subtle, and it is worth explaining what The Economist <i>actually</i> means in this article. This is especially true given the international audience of the paper (and HN), where these terms sometimes appear to mean contradictory things.<p>I won&#x27;t pretend to be a master political theoretician, so corrections are welcome, but at a high level here is what is going on.<p>In most of political theory, the spectrum breaks down roughly into two huge types of political party (and yes this is a massive generalization):<p>* those on the right wing, which are typically <i>fiscally liberal</i> and <i>socially conservative</i>, that is, they believe that companies should behave as they like, but people need to be told how to behave even in their private lives, and<p>* those on the left wing, which are mainly <i>socially liberal</i>, that is, they believe that the government should tax and regulate more heavily, but that people should be able to do what they like privately.<p>Across the globe what it means to be &quot;a liberal&quot; is different. In the US, the &quot;liberal&quot; signifier refers to the fact that the person believes that the government should not regulate personal decisions like gay marriage. In France, it is the opposite: the &quot;liberal&quot; signifer refers to the fact that they like less regulation on the markets.<p>The Economist, simply put, is liberal in the sense that it tends to favor less regulation on <i>both</i> these fronts: it favors legalization of drugs and gay marriage, but also less regulation for markets.<p>There are of course exceptions (it favors gun regulation for example), but this is basically the position that it has come to call &quot;radical centerism&quot;. The magazine is often called libertarian, but only conveniently so -- the gun control exception in particular casts this supposition into doubt, and rather than accept this branding, the editorial staff has evidently decided to pick this new title.<p>This is probably the right move.

And a raise doesn&#x27;t even have to match what an employee would get from switching jobs.  For example, if an employee could get 10k raise by changing jobs, many would stay if given a raise half of that.  The reason is, switching jobs is risky.  Next job could have a bad boss, bad coworkers, etc.  If offered, it would often make sense to stay at a good job and take the 5k instead of going for the 10k with unknown risks.<p>But instead they just give no raises, or even insult their high performers with a &quot;generous&quot; 3% and cause resentment and lower morale.",1383099671

The right were people supporting the king.<p>The left were thus generally looking for change, and more freedoms, and formed the core of liberalism. With the rise of socialism, liberalism in Europe got confined around the centre.<p>But of course as you point out it is difficult to classify, as e.g. already back then socialism was by no means uniquely left wing (Marx criticised ideologies he considered as &quot;feudal&quot; or &quot;reactionary&quot; socialist ideologies that would fit on the right in the &quot;classic&quot; French left/right split, for example), and terms like libertarian also spans the full spectrum (you have libertarian Marxists, various anarchist tendencies, left-communism etc.).<p>If you consider a few axes, though, you get a good idea: - level of support for authority and personal freedoms (e.g. from no state at all to authoritarian state), level of protection of private property (e.g. no legal support for private property of means of production to considering protection of private property as one of the most important aspects of government), and level of secularism. Of course there&#x27;s plenty of oddballs combinations.<p>> Or you can be against abortion rights, and also want welfare programs for the poor. \n> These things are in no way tied together by any philosophical reasoning.<p>You might be surprised. In Europe, most Christian parties fall centre-right to moderately conservative and tended to have separated out of either the conservative or liberal parties, or become the dominant force in their countries conservative parties, and do indeed often argue against abortion rights yet want welfare programs for the poor for clearly defined philosophical reasons.<p>The general  philosophical reasoning for most of these parties <i>in Europe</i> can be shortened to &quot;personal freedoms and personal responsibility, but not at the expense of christian morality&quot;, and the christian morality part both moderates the personal freedoms (abortion views etc.) and strengthens the social commitment (welfare).

6639001,comment,6637919,6638375,1,0,pyoung,,,"That&#x27;s not necessarily true. Proportional representation often has the undesirable side effect of dramatically increasing the power of small minority parties.  The reason is that in order to gain majority control of the government larger parties often have to make significant concessions to a smaller minority party to get the votes.  Also, you can end up with a lot of gridlock if no coalition can reach majority.<p>Two party systems have it&#x27;s flaws, but what we are seeing now is more typical of a proportional system.  Due to overly effective gerrymandering, the Republican hold on many congressional districts is so secure that the only real threat to those seats is from party extremists.  Under our normal two party system with less polarized districts, extremist politicians couldn&#x27;t win in general elections, but now that so many Republican districts are so secure, the party has essentially been captured by extremists (it&#x27;s not a stretch to call the Tea Party a third party).  In the past, the two party system worked by consensus, the more moderate members of each party would work together to carve out solutions to a problem, and keep in mind, the more moderate party members were typically from contested districts, so they needed to demonstrate leadership and good results to get re-elected.  The end result was that the party that demonstrated the best leadership would get re-elected.<p>The Republican &#x27;take no prisoners&#x27; strategy can probably be traced back to Gingrich.  We are now seeing a culmination of that strategy, and I think most would agree that it has backfired.  If I was in the business of making bold predictions, I think I would bet that the Republican party might get replaced by a new, more moderate party in the next 20 years.  More realistically, they are going to shift back to the middle.  Two party systems won&#x27;t work otherwise, and our government isn&#x27;t really designed to allow multiple parties.",1383099129

I&#x27;ve been doing database backed web development for quite a while now, and I&#x27;ve had jobs doing that in C, TCL, perl, java, C#, python, Delphi and ruby.  But they were all chiefly database backed web development, so basically the same thing, despite being completely different languages.<p>I expect I would have significant trouble getting hired to do a different specialization, like parts of a videogame engine (say c or C++ or python or lua).  So as long as database backed websites are in demand I&#x27;m probably ok, but if those disappeared tomorrow I could become a statistic - if everything becomes apps, I&#x27;ll manage, but that round of interviewing won&#x27;t be as easy as the last few rounds of interviewing were and I&#x27;ll probably have to take some personal time developing a demo to talk about.<p>I&#x27;ve seen two friends with mainframe experience end up having lots of trouble finding new jobs - they could certainly program, but had nothing they could point to that seemed relevant to the web dev jobs.  And a friend who works on videogame engines is trying to make a switch to websites and it&#x27;s looking hard to make that switch.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strictly along language lines, but I do think employers are hesitant to sub in one type of programmer for another.

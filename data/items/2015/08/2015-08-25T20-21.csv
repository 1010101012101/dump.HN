However even if they aren&#x27;t secretly just religious they do use the motives of religious fundamentalism to support their actions and to motivate their supporters and followers, and their supporters are rarely aware of the nuances. The leaders do excuse what they do with their religious talks.<p>> My point was that the article you linked to makes the point (at least that was what i inferred) that IS is more &#x27;reasonable&#x27;/rational than religious<p>I don&#x27;t agree. We can&#x27;t equate the higher levels (leaders) and the voters, the supporters and the simple fighters. Only the leaders are those who (by necessity) understand the game (if I remember correctly Bin Laden had the full reports of the US think tanks in his library). The lower levels just religiously believe. Exactly like most of the common people in the US still didn&#x27;t get that there were actually no WMD and no Al Quaida in Iraq at the time Dubbya Bush (the leader) initiated his war.<p>On one (higher) level in the same political/religious side, there is rationality, on another (lower) ignorance. User gkya just wasn&#x27;t able to be precise enough, as you see, it takes time until people who take part in the conversation start to understand one another. And I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m elitist when I&#x27;m aware of these different levels, just as you&#x27;ve felt that it&#x27;s important to note the obvious rationality of the leaders (even if you missed to make that difference in the second post).",1440536011

This allows the PLB to be much bigger than a conventional TLB could ever be.<p>Second, the PLB entries do not need to be fixed power-of-two sizes.  Each PLB entry has a start and stop offset so protection can be as granular as protecting one byte.  In general, though, a single PLB entry will be quite large, covering the whole mapped region.<p>The Mill still has a TLB but it sits between chip and the off-chip memory.  This allows it to be larger than a conventional TLB, as it taking slightly longer will not have the same impact.  Additionally, as a small implementation optimisation, the TLB on the bigger Mill family members will do a lot of things like allocating-from-a-pool dynamically, so you only trap to the OS when things get dire.<p>The Mill address has a special bit to signify if it is a global address, or whether it is &quot;local&quot; to the process (using a special register which is XORed into the address).  This allows the Mill to fork() and all the other things that traditionally have been hard on a SASOS.<p>We are porting Linux, and it will be Linux.  Only a very very small part of the HAL will need to know anything Mill-specific :)",1440535492

The best way to learn/practice ear training is to find someone who&#x27;s decent at piano and play through some progressions you&#x27;d find in a theory book.<p>(Diversion on theory textbooks...) Though I didn&#x27;t pick it, at my school we use Steve Laitz&#x27;s <i>The Complete Musician</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Musician-Integrated-Approach-Listening/dp/0199742782/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Musician-Integrated-Approach-...</a>) and its associated workbooks. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for self-study, because there are a lot of little errors in it a student likely wouldn&#x27;t notice, and it&#x27;s prone to confusing people. What might be better for learning on your own is Gary Karpinski&#x27;s <i>Manual for Ear Training and Sight Singing</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Manual-Ear-Training-Sight-Singing/dp/0393976637/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Manual-Ear-Training-Sight-Singing/dp/0...</a>) and the CD that goes along with it. Finding ear-training books is kind of difficult, since most are designed to be used in a class with a teacher. I have more opinions on textbooks but I&#x27;ll save that rant for now.<p>Online, this site is pretty good for basic intervals and chords (as I said above), and <a href=""http://www.musictheory.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.musictheory.net/</a> also has some pretty basic exercises. It avoids a lot of the problems I mentioned above by simply not having those exercises for ear training. I think it&#x27;s pretty good for people who don&#x27;t know anything and want to learn, but I usually don&#x27;t recommend it to my students because it tends to fuzz some specifics as it gets more advanced. I often recommend this software called Practica Musica (<a href=""http://www.ars-nova.com/practica6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ars-nova.com/practica6.html</a>), which we have installed in the lab at school.<p>(Background: I teach at a liberal-arts undergraduate institution, and the theory curriculum focuses on common-practice tonal music in the Western tradition.

10119201,comment,10117072,10117072,0,0,theOnliest,,,"I really like this, for the most part (and apropos, since the first day of teaching ear-training for the semester is tomorrow!).<p>You&#x27;re probably randomly generating these, but I would strongly suggest incorporating some voice-leading and standard syntax into the examples. When it plays I-IV-V-I to establish the key, for example, it plays 3 root-position triads with parallel voice-leading:<p><pre><code>    5 - 1 - 2 - 5
    3 - 6 - 7 - 3
    1 - 4 - 5 - 1
</code></pre>
Usually when ear training, the idea is to be able to hear common tonal progressions, where this kind of voice leading almost never shows up. Something like this would be better (and better still with a bass voice playing the roots in a different octave):<p><pre><code>    5 - 6 - 5 - 5
    3 - 4 - 2 - 3
    1 - 1 - 7 - 1
</code></pre>
I had trouble with the chord progression and melodic dictation exercises, since they&#x27;re not common tonal progressions. The melodic dictation I tried first went ^6, up to ^5, down to ^1, and down again to ^3. While the minor seventh is a really common tonal interval, it&#x27;s really <i>uncommon</i> to hear it from scale degree 6 in a major key up to scale degree 5 (you&#x27;d only really ever hear it as an applied chord of ii).<p>Likewise, the first chord progression I tried went I - ii7 - ii - IV7. This is a progression you would not be likely to hear in tonal music (even in rock, jazz, and other modern genres). Once a chord gets a seventh (ii7), it doesn&#x27;t usually lose it until its resolution (so ii7 to ii isn&#x27;t a logical progression), and the progression ii to IV7 is a retrogression (at least in tonal classical music: this one you&#x27;d be slightly more likely to hear in rock perhaps, but I imagine it&#x27;s still pretty rare).<p>All this is to say that I really like the idea, but I&#x27;m hesitant to tell my students about it because the random generation might lead them to things which I would never play in an ear-training class (because they never show up in common-practice tonal music). The way around this , and the way I&#x27;ve done it before, is  to generate a bunch of scale-degree patterns or chord progression patterns and shuffle them randomly. If you&#x27;re interested in developing this further I&#x27;d be happy to help come up with some of these. For intervals, scales, and individual chords, though, it&#x27;s really great.",1440534284

I know I just had to scan the front page to find some article condemning Arab nationalism and of course one is there, &quot;The Mystery of ISIS&quot; by an anonymous author.  It contains pictures of people about to be executed, and a picture of someone pointing a gun at the camera, so you can guess what the text is.  What it doesn&#x27;t talk about is how the US in the past supported religious fanatics in the Middle East against the real US enemy - secular, left-leaning pan-Arab nationalists.  Just as the US does today.  The US supports Saudi Arabia, where women can&#x27;t drive, yet bombed Libya, just a few years after Qadaffi had given in to the US and UK after years of Nasserite posturing.  Now Islamic fundamentalists sprout there.  In Iraq, we had another Nasserite, pan-Arab secular nationalist in a party with socialist roots - Saddam Hussein was overthrown and now we have ISIS in Iraq. 
More recently the pan-Arab secular nationalist in a party with secular roots in Syria has the US and Europe working to undermine his power.  This just happened.  So now ISIS controls much of Syria, and just blew up an ancient pagan temple.  It&#x27;s quite clear with all its work to undermine Bashar al-Assad that this is what the US was working to have happen.  We can go more into the distant past as well - the secular nationalist parliament of Mossadegh being replaced by a dictatorship initially backed by the mullahs by the US/UK in the 1950s, then the persecution and execution of the secular left - eventually the mullahs changed their mind and now Iran is run by them and devoid of the secular liberals that the CIA sent lists around to be executed.<p>I&#x27;m surprised the New York Review of Books doesn&#x27;t have a nostalgic front-cover piece bashing the Warsaw Pact.  Well there were just two on HN&#x27;s front page the other day.  It&#x27;s great - while the US government is tapping its own citizens and the whole world, extraditing and torturing nationalists who oppose foreign intervention in their home countries, ringing the world with military bases - a US soldier just murdered a Filipino prostitute who he learned was a transvestite, spying on foreign corporations and stealing their industrial secrets, sending drones to willy-nilly bomb villages in Pakistan and Afghanistan and so on, everyone can focus on the errors Lenin commited a century ago, or how some ISIS militants blew up an ancient pagan temple in Syria (who the US helped back by undermining al-Assad&#x27;s government - in fact investigative reporters have found the US has been actively backing jihadists in Iraq even in recent years).",1440533914

He descibes non-dualism as:&quot;More spiritually, the idea of non-dualism is a relationship to reality that proposes that everything is inextricably connected and alive, even inanimate objects.&quot;<p>I can see how someone with such views would find it logical to attribute decision-making to objects or find it a sensible choice of words.

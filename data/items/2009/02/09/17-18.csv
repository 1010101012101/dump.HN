Putting Jeff aside, I prefer blogs that have a healthy amount of bias. Writing that tries to be judicious, dispassionate and balanced often ends up being dry and comes off with a pseudo-academic tone.<p>A little bias adds passion and fire. As long as they aren't totally wrong, that's a good thing. A while back all the big companies were ""diversifying"" so that their stock would become immune to the vagaries of any one market or business unit.<p>This was almost always a failure, because professional managers want to achieve diversification through their portfolio selection, where they can pursue their own mix and make changes by trading in the market, not through having business managers engage in lengthy and expensive M&A activity.<p>Blogs are a little like that: If I want a balanced read I'd rather read several different posts about the same subject than try to find one person who tries to present the centrist view.",1234202328

If you want it to be a dating site, you'll need to add location, and try to match closer people first. I also think that you should add things like age and only match people similarly.<p>+ I'm not sure whether your business model will work well ($2.99 for unlimited chatting with someone). I've tried a number of sites, and the chances of a particular person working out is not good -- plus, a lot of people just won't reply after I contact them. More importantly, I'll need to know if someone is CLOSE to me to determine if I'll pay you. Also, your site falls into one of those that I'm distasteful of -- I sign up for the site, and then LATER, I find out there are hidden fees when they aren't initially mentioned.<p>+ I also feel like there's nothing to ""do"" on your site. You should have a page where I can see how many people have seen my picture, how many voted yes/no, maybe even to whom they voted yes/no on -- that would be interesting yet not too invasive.<p>+ Make it clear that the more I vote, the more my picture will be seen -- in other words, if I rate x people, I need to see a noticable increase in the number of people seeing MY picture. This works very well for Facebook apps like Compare People.<p>+ You may want to approve pictures before they're published. I already saw one in the queue that is non-human, and you could also get pornographic ones.<p>+ This would be a cool facebook app. Although apps are less prominent nowadays, here's how some current successful ones work -- periodically send me an email about x people voting me as a match or not. Provide a link to your facebook app page in the email that immediately asks me to rate people (more ratings, more views), and a side link to see my stats. This works on me at least!<p>+ When I first open the page, the larger upper box looked to me like a popup flash ad, and i totally didn't realize that the items on the right were clickable until i accidentally ran my cursor over them.<p>+ When entering my profile, if I sporadically decide to change my pic midway through, the form forgets everything I entered so far. And maybe the tab order should be both things I like, then things I dislike.<p>+ I'm not sure what ""Loading...please vote to enable this user's queue"" means. You should provide a countdown if it matters whether I vote.<p>+ I also agree with other posters -- ""yumbunny"" doesn't sound like a dating site haha",1234201767

473812,comment,473421,473421,0,0,pelle,,,"I myself am an armchair economics. I am fairly well read on the subject over the year. I think to an extent the article has a point. However if the whole point of the post is true, then it's summary should of course also be taken into doubt. ;-)<p>The real trouble with economics is that even economists disagree. It really is impossible to say anything like consensus amongst economists is x. A recent EconTalk (an excellent podcast to learn more about economics) talks about just this issue. Why do economists disagree:<p><a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/01/roberts_and_han.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/01/roberts_and_han.htm...</a><p>Their conclusion is that it is so easy to go in and fine statistics to prove just about any point, so in the end it is the ""religion"" of the economist in the end that decides which statistics and studies he uses. The two major schools and yes there are many more of Economics Keynesian vs Austrian/Chicago (ok those are 2 schools, but closely related) are in such a fundamental disagreement about just about anything.<p>Which brings me to question the premise of your article. I think it's healthy that geeks have an interest in economics. In particular geeks involved in startups need to know and understand the dynamics going on. So their analysis might not match yours, but that doesn't matter. They have an understanding and interest that helps them understand the world around them. This is not necessarily bad, in particularly if they are open to learning.<p>Saying that geeks shouldn't think about economics, because it's too complex for them to understand completely is just plain silly and also extremely elitist. It is also to a certain extent hypocritical as your post intentional or not says ""Your understanding of economics is not as good as mine, so just stop thinking you know anything"".<p>My ""religion"" in economics is the Austrian school of economics. I definitely view the world and politics through these colored glasses. I gradually arrived there on a long journey starting off as a socialist.<p>My life as a programmer has definitely helped me reach the conclusion that the economy is so complex that no amount of experts could possibly understand it completely. That the only possible way of living (not controlling) in such a complex system is through a distributed network of autonomous agents. I am sure many other programmers have reached the same conclusions.<p>My belief in markets has been flavored recently by Nassim Taleb's Black Swan, who concludes that the reason free markets are superior is not because of some complex theory of efficient prices, but because free markets allow more people to experiment and therefore accidentally find the right answers. An expert driven planned economy allows only one person throwing the dice.<p>The next 3 paragraphs should be understood is my conclusion about elitists as seen through my ""free market"" goggles:<p>Then again there are many other programmers who follow another religion. Since childhood many programmers have always been the most intelligent person we know. If you grow up like this it is very easy to start seeing other people as stupid. This is essentially how elitism grows.<p>It is very hard to avoid being elitist, when you spend a lot of time analyzing every situation in your life and see the vast majority of the people out there not doing the same. This elitist way of thinking almost requires the intelligentsia to take control. People often credit this way of thinking to Plato, all though it is such a natural way of thinking I'm sure it goes way back.<p>The Keynesian approach is one of the less evil outcomes of this elitist way of thinking. ""We need to stimulate the economy so the small simple people can build their economy up"". The other extreme was Lenin's dictatorship of the proletariat, where he concluded that it would take several generations of reeducation of the people by the elite, before society would be perfect. These two approaches while very different have the same fundamental reasoning that people are stupid and we the decision makers are not.<p>Both of these economic religions are very common among geeks. I also think it is natural that they are prevalent and that people discuss it. You see both of these (I know I'm overgeneralizing) battle it out on hacker news. I think this is actually healthy. I know that I can't convince a true believer of socialism that the free markets are the way to go. I can also safely say that it is highly unlikely that anyone will convince me in a single discussion that we should all become leninists.<p>That said, I have been corrected several times in discussions here on hacker news and have learnt from that. It is also an interesting and fun intellectual exercise for both of us. Who knows we might even convince someone sitting on the fence to jump off in our direction.<p>My conclusion is that Geeks and in particular geeks in startups should have an interest in economics. I also don't think we need to hold geeks to an even higher standard than actual card holding economics professors.",1234201250

I've read about 30 books, most of them $25+ versions for $10, so I consider my initial investment almost recouped.<p>Amazon does DRM the right way - instead of taking away value with their DRM, they _add_ value.  Unlike Apple, which lets me download my content _once_, (and if my hard drive on one of the half dozen devices that I've downloaded content and have still to sync back up to my NAS crashed, results in me losing it forever), Amazon has this concept of content that I _own_ - and may or may not be on the device in my hand.  A situation which can be rectified in a few minutes with whispernet (their EVDO solution) by copying (as many times as I want) from Amazon onto my current device (presumably now my K2 as well as my K1).<p>You cannot borrow books from a friend - the content is tied to you, which is why can save close to $15/book.<p>I love the fact that I walk around with my entire library.  I like to travel light, both when moving at home and when on vacation, and not having to deal with a bookshelf of light fiction, and taking books to the library when done, (or going through hassle of selling them on Amazon for 1/3 price) has been a HUGE win for me.  (That's one problem that kindle solves).  Not having to worry about losing my content, and having Amazon track it for me is another problem.  And the book is amazingly easy on the eyes, _particularly_ in very bright light, I find it much easier than paper.  (Third problem solved - no glare from paper).<p>I find it funny when people suggest that the iPhone might be used for reading books - it's as unlikely an idea as people buying a Kindle to listen to music.  Wrong Form Factor.  Battery life alone would kill you.  Not to mention screen size.<p>With all that said - The kindle sucks as a replacement for technical books. I purchased a couple and was frustrated to no end. Page turning is too slow. The Kindle doesn't have a good metaphor for flipping between random pages. Resolution was poor for technical diagrams. Screen was too small. Rumor has it that Amazon is going to come out with a larger version for textbooks - we'll see. Until then, I continue to buy my technical books on paper. But for fiction which basically is linear page flipping of text - it's great.",1234200357

473739,comment,473438,473610,0,0,Nelson69,,,"Ada is a fine language.  For those of us that did the Turbo Pascal thing and enjoyed that Ada isn't that far off.    There was this odd sort of period in my life,  I learned Pascal and took classes that used it and wrote fairly complicated programs that by in large worked.   Most of the debugging I did was really logic debugging.  Then I switched to C and between the esoterics of doing C on a DOS x86 machine (anyone remember the difference between ASCII files and binary files?) and the language itself I started spending a lot more time debugging C and I put a lot more effort in to making programs radically more simple just to avoid complex debugging.    At times I kind of pine for those old Pascal days... Had I not experienced that era, I might have gone in a different direction entirely.<p>Through out the 90's I tought C++ to undergrads for a couple years and there was this disease of sorts,  some went though so much pain trying to make C++ do simple things (and they had no understanding of what the machine was really doing, they were trying to just learn a language)  that they either a) would drop out of computer science all together or b) they'd have such a better taste in their mouth that they'd never fully learn Lisp or ML or really anything else and always revert back to C++.   Ada is quite similar to Pascal in syntax and sort of behaves the same way.  FWIW,  Ada is kind of interesting,  if you've ever wasted a lot of time tracking down where you C program bumped the stack or leaked memory or something then the things Ada requires of you are kind of nice in a way.<p>Seems Ada missed the timing on a number of issues.   First Ada compilers were built to be sold to the feds,  they essentially designed the language and they mandated its use and so compiler writers assumed that they could charge $20,000 a seat type prices.   Completely missed the market, largely due to costs.  This put a very serious damper on things.<p>The other thing that they missed on was tooling.   When Java first came on to the scene there was a vocal group of folks that were used to teletypes and modems and such and the difference between ""{"" and ""}"" and ""BEGIN"" and ""END"" was substantial to them.  If they have a Visual Studio or Eclipse like programming environment,  those differences kind of vanish but that argument took place in the early and mid 1990s,  there are still people that feel that their coding ability is strongly related to their typing ability.<p>By the time tooling caught up and the GNAT compiler was around Ada had accumulated a huge perception deficit.  Also the world has moved on and a lot of developers want protected runtimes, like a JVM or CLR or the interpreter of Ruby, Perl and Python.   There are still efforts to create higher level C competitors,  the D programming language, the Eiffel programming language,  Modula-3 as one,  it just seems that not that many people are interested.<p>I like to look at Rails and I think a big part of its success has nothing to do with any technology so much as the effort they put in to teaching their users a good and working structure to build web apps, they will automatically generate the skeleton and you fill it in;   by the time you've done a real world production Rails app, you've done everything yourself and don't even realize it because they got you started.   Ada and Pascal sort of provided that structure to building machine code applications,  people really rebel against that structure unless you sort of trick them into it like Rails does.",1234199339

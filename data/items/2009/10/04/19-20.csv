Once more companies figure out how to do this, then smart people will evaluate that advertisement with as much value as a fellow community member's dis/approval.

Leo Laporte has a huge level of trust in the tech community, and we all know he is here because he truly loves what he does and would never compromise his community.

I said let's deal with it on Monday.  Monday comes around and the secretary calls me and says the server is locked up. I walk her through a hard reboot... then hard disk DOA, as in ""no bootable drive found"", no partition, no files. My heart sank. Even worse the tape drive that died had not written a usable backup in weeks even though the logs reported no errors. The best tape we had was 2 months old, not much use but better than nothing. Fortunately, the data recovery firm was able to get the data off the old hard disk but it cost the company about $3K.<p>Another good rule... if you inherit a new customer you need to ""trust but verify"" the previous tech's work. I warn my new clients about the added costs of checking and learning a new setup.  I learned this one the hard way when a new client had a decent tape backup program in place but I never  did a test restore. One day they needed some deleted files restored and was shocked to learn that the previous tech had inadvertantly selected the option to backup the directory structure only!

I too started a business while I was in college to pay the bills-- turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life.  Looking back, the most important thing I had going for me was a great co-founder that complimented my interests and skill set.<p>When we were starting out we thought about the following questions <i>all</i> of the time:<p>- Do people want our product?<p>- How are we differentiated?<p>- What will this cost us?<p>- How will we make money?<p>- Who can we ask for advice?<p>- What are we forgetting?<p>Focus on making something people want-- this is paramount.  A good rule of thumb is that your product needs to be <i>good enough</i> that people willingly recommend it to others.  Make sure your product is differentiated-- people won't trust you at first (and they will trust an established competitor) so you need to offer something customers can't get elsewhere.  Charge for your product-- sounds obvious, but you can't make money without it and it's not as easy as it sounds.  Network, network, network-- too many founders forget to network with customers, vendors, business partners, future employees, etc. because they get too focused on developing the product.  Networking will be a great source of feedback and will open doors you may never have known existed.  Remember, you're creating a <i>business</i> not just creating a product.",1254685016

A few years ago Skype released plProxy and pgBouncer, both of which are key to PostgreSQL scaling.  What they in essence do is allow for transparent horizontal scaling of servers.  One defines a cluster in plProxy and then when you run stored procedure queries, they remotely execute on the proper shared server based upon the primary key data.

The way it was backed up was to quiesce the standby, take a snapshot of its filesystems on the SAN, then send those to tape while the standby was reenabled. Sounds good. But what had happened was that the sysadmin, to speed it up, was running several parallel backups, each one of which had a hard-coded list of files.<p>So as soon as one new datafile was added to the database (I estimate, a week after that regime was put in place) all subsequent backups were invalid. We were in that situation for over a year <i>and everyone believed that the databases was being properly backed up</i>. We would even occasionally restore a file (picked from the backupset, hmm) and block-verify it. I only discovered it when I was upgrading the system and I fixed it <i>real</i> quick (dynamically generating n equally-sized lists of files is trivial!). Hard coding the list of files was stupid, sure, and betrayed a fundamental lack of understanding about how the system worked - but it was also stupid that no-one ever checked, and that betrayed a lack of understanding of how organizations work.<p>The lesson I took away from that was, you have to have people who have visibility of things end-to-end.",1254683679

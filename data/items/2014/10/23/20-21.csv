8500717,comment,8498782,8500398,0,0,aaron-lebo,,,"> The legitimately dystopian part of Brave New World are often technical in nature—effectively mind control through drugs and a caste system propped up by genetic engineering. These don&#x27;t just require advances in technology but also a surprising level of social organization. Where 1984 feels like a continuous progression from a Soviet Union that never collapsed, these core parts of Brave New World comes of as discontinuous, a jump both socially and technically.<p>These seems like crazy steps in our modern society, but keep in mind, Huxley was writing this in 1931. Eugenics were something readily embraced by the upper classes. The Soviet Union gravitated towards the totalitarian state it was, but at that time, it wouldn&#x27;t have been crazy to imagine a government (imagine a less jingoistic Germany, with all the creativity and efficiency), creating something very much like what Huxley envisions. In fact, had the West not had the ongoing competition with the totalitarian Soviet Union, the capitalist impulses could have merged with a much larger government, and the United States, or Continental European powers could have turned into something like that. Constant conflict both militarily and ideologically may have been the only thing that prevented it.<p>> It&#x27;s also a bit grating because I sense some condescending overtones. &quot;Look at all those people who don&#x27;t care about the world but just distract themselves with popular entertainment. How shallow!&quot; Obviously you, the reader, do not belong to this group.<p>You may be right, but that&#x27;s probably not fair to Huxley. In writing his book, he was speaking directly to his readers, trying to convince them that they were not so different from the utopia which he mocks.<p>> And hey, I don&#x27;t disagree per se—I think most popular distractions are shallow and have much better alternatives—but I also think there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with enjoying them. I mean, I follow the news, I care about recent events and where does it get me? Nowhere. I guess I could vote² a bit better, but all it&#x27;s done is sour me on all major candidates. Is this meaningfully better than comfortable ignorance? No, but people tell me it is. And here I am.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing. At that stage, you have two choices. Either realize that our societies are flawed and struggle to do something about it, whether you can turn the tide or not, or take the soma, act like the world is okay (in the West, or own small worlds often are perfectly fine), and do nothing. What is disconcerting about our society, and similar to Brave New World, is apathy and consumerism have caused a lot of people (not necessarily you), to fall into the latter column, which could very easily lead to 1984.",1414097965

I&#x27;ve had rents as low as $225/month w/ all utilities included (newly furnished/redone kitchen, no obvious problems). That&#x27;s low enough that ~ 1 week of McDonald&#x27;s work will have paid for your rent, the other 3 weeks of monthly income can go to food ($100-150) and assorted needs like toiletries ($20-50). That still leaves you with ~$500/month after essentials which is honestly more than most people making $30-50k/yr actually put away into savings.<p>The issue with the homeless isn&#x27;t that the jobs don&#x27;t pay enough to keep them off the streets, it&#x27;s that they lack the mental faculties to hold onto even the most basic of jobs.

Like Ubuntu they were striving for a user-friendly distribution, but they never got the the level of consistency Ubuntu had.<p>Why? Because they chose KDE at the beginning, but they didn&#x27;t stick with their choice and did what every other distribution did: let users choose between KDE and Gnome. And spent time to have all their tools look &quot;kinda OK&quot; in both desktops with cross Qt-Gtk themes, and Gnome users got a not so great experience but they kept shouting that Gnome users were just as important to them as KDE users, etc.<p>So in short they thought of themselves a &quot;Linux distribution&quot;, a way to install Linux and related software. On the other hand, Ubuntu considers itself an OS, and upstream software is just a way for them to achieve the degree of quality they want.<p>You see that also when Ubuntu releases Unity: they want their OS to work this way, while Mandrake always focused on (1) the installer and (2) the control panel where you configure stuff, thinking &quot;the desktop is Gnome/KDE&#x27;s job, let&#x27;s just ship what they make&quot;.<p>There was other reasons why Ubuntu worked better than Mandrake: one is that they used the superior dpkg while Mandrake was using RPM. (RPM got better recently, but back in the day it was a huge pain). Honestly I felt for many years that a user-friendly distribution based on dpkg would bring the best of both worlds, and that&#x27;s what Ubuntu was.<p>Also Ubuntu arrived as the right time, when it was possible to have a fully plug-and-play distribution if your hardware is standard enough. I don&#x27;t think they could have achieve that in the 90&#x27;s.<p>And of course marketing. Ubuntu have been very good at marketing, and that&#x27;s a good thing.",1414097205

The homeless people I know are generally the kinder, gentler types -- down on their luck musicians, artists, more intellectual types. I tend avoid anyone who is violent or &quot;scammy&quot;.<p>This is just my opinion, based my my limited experience. And  homelessness is a big problem, so there will be a lot of different approaches. But I see it as primarily a problem of mental health. A lot of the homeless I know were abused, or came from shitty families, or had abusive parents, or any of a number of major childhood issues and their families didn&#x27;t have the financial or emotional resources to do anything about it. So I tend to see &quot;get tough on the homeless&quot; programs as blaming the victim. I think that forcing people to go into any kind of program or shelter or whatever is just going to lead to resentment and more problems in the long run. Most shelters are pretty bad already, and that&#x27;s with people who want to be there. Imagine how bad it&#x27;ll be with people who really don&#x27;t want to be there.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to keep people accountable -- E.g. Insist that if they want to be in a clean, decent shelter for three months and get meals then they need to make thrir bed, do dishes, go to group meeting daily and look for work, or see a doctor or psychiatrist, etc...<p>What I think they really need is a long-term program for re-integrating into society, sort of like prisoners getting out, one that includes basics like a place to live for a year or two, health care, food, as well as psychological care and job training. Many will be helped by that, but not all. Hopefully, people from the local community or church or something will be involved as well. It&#x27;s also important that there be a self-help group sort of like AA, but geared for the homeless, &quot;homeless anonymous&quot;, where people could talk openly about their life and experiences and be with others who have been through similar things.",1414096087

Windows runs on everything powered by an x86 processor.<p>I&#x27;ve tried installing Windows 7 on an old Dell laptop a while ago. I got it working eventually, but had to hunt around for drivers for various things -- rather important things, like network, and video. In the end, I had to persuade some download site to give me the Windows XP drivers for the video card, and it worked with that (which, btw, is pretty awesome).<p>Of course, this is just anecdote, just like any story about Linux not working immediately on some modern laptop is -- but my experience is that these kinds of issues are much rarer than 10 years ago.

Real happiness is deep-rooted, it isn&#x27;t swayed easily, nor is it a direct consequence of transient events.<p>No real advocate of the pursuit of happiness has ever believed that life was inherently happy, however most think that life provides the conditions and the tools to make it happen.

People sell their money for goods and services when they deem it profitable to them. For instance, I could build my own house, but the time required to learn and then build it is more than the time it takes me to trade my (preferred) labor for money, then use that money to trade for a housemaker&#x27;s (preferred) labor, because people are better (ie. more efficient) at what they prefer to do. The housemaker accepts to trade their labor for money because they also want things for which it is more profitable for the housemaker to build a house for money and then trade that money for what they want. The process of trading something with someone else for something you prefer results in what we call profit.<p>This also means when you say &quot;moneyless transactions like BitCoin&quot;, you&#x27;re mistaken; bitcoin is money. Money is any product for which there is a large enough network of people willing to accept that product as payment for labor. So the rise of BitCoin won&#x27;t decrease the exchange rate of money, because BitCoin will become money by definition, since it will be used by people to arbitrage their time in a profitable way as explained in the previous paragraph.<p>Then you say wealth will increase because machines can make things. But the more you have of something, the more its value goes down. This is supply and demand. So you don&#x27;t get automatic wealth just because machines can produce, for instance, a bunch of tires, and a bunch of cars, if there&#x27;s not enough people wanting those cars with tires to self-drive them around. That means customers will assign less value to tires and cars, as the overabundance of tires and cars drive their own prices down.<p>I haven&#x27;t heard of WinCo, but if you&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re more profitable than Walmart, then I should hope they drive Walmart out of business. I have no hatred for Walmart, mind you; but I do have a love for better things, and charging cheaper prices than competitors while making more money seems to me like a win-win for everyone involved. If WinCo&#x27;s business model really works, and yet it hasn&#x27;t displaced Walmart, and assuming what you say is true, then I&#x27;m lead to believe other forces (likely regulatory) are keeping this outcome from being brought about. I&#x27;d appreciate if you could educate me as to why WinCo stores aren&#x27;t popping up everywhere and displacing Walmart (or maybe they are and I&#x27;m ignorant).<p>I&#x27;m still having trouble understanding how you got so quickly to the conclusion that &quot;the solution that I see is to raise taxes&quot;. I also find it weird that you say things like &quot;the community makes nothing other than taxes&quot;. The community is constituted of people. People can make money by selling their labor. Why do they expect Valve to work for them? I&#x27;m confused.<p>Also when you talk about US&#x27;s high tax rates (70-90%) in its highest growth decades (1950s and 60s), you should make sure to mention that they also had more loopholes than we have today, which means in effect that companies in general were paying nowhere near the official tax rate in taxes (they were paying around 30%). See [1] for a page with links to the studies. This is one of the most common economics history fallacy floating around today.<p>Your analysis of spreading over GDP to the population don&#x27;t take into account the change effect; that once you do that, people&#x27;s behaviors change unexpectedly in a way that you can&#x27;t guarantee that the GDP will remain anywhere close to what it is. Numbers look into the past, not the future. The GDP now only means how much was produced given the variables in place. If the variables were different (eg. more income distribution) then the outcome would be different (either more or less, or the same for different reasons). But because Economics fails to produce falsifiable and reproducible theories, we can never know for sure. With that in mind, number gymnastics as you do it is baseless.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/21/krugmans-twinkie-defense/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/21/krugmans-twinkie-defense/</a>",1414095286

8500398,comment,8498782,8498782,0,0,tikhonj,,,"I actually agree with some of the other commenters in this thread: Huxley&#x27;s dystopia is, well, far less dystopian than Orwell&#x27;s. Or, in a more nuanced look, Huxley&#x27;s book suffers an unfortunate dichotomy: the things that are bad are not realistic and the things that are realistic are not bad.<p>The legitimately dystopian part of <i>Brave New World</i> are often technical in nature—effectively mind control through drugs and a caste system propped up by genetic engineering. These don&#x27;t just require advances in technology but also a surprising level of social organization. Where <i>1984</i> feels like a continuous progression from a Soviet Union that never collapsed, these core parts of <i>Brave New World</i> comes of as discontinuous, a jump both socially and technically.<p>And without these extreme social and technical changes, it stops being a dystopia. If not for the eugenics, genetics and soma, it sounds like a nice place to live! Freer sex, freer entertainment, more automation, more leisure... It&#x27;s radical, certainly, but not in a bad way—a radical departure from our current almost Puritan work ethic and our obsession with certain abstractions (the poorly defined &quot;real vs superficial&quot;, &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;the dignity of work&quot;¹...etc) sounds like just what we need.<p>I like giving people what they want, even if I think it&#x27;s shallow or superficial. Then again, I&#x27;ve never been one to treat hedonism as a bad word.<p>That cartoon people like to pass around really captures my thoughts—in a way that&#x27;s opposite to its intended message! It shows how some of the believable things in <i>Brave New World</i> are believable, but never shows why they&#x27;re <i>bad</i>. It just assumes, and ties into cultural ideas (like &quot;hard work is good&quot; or &quot;your life must have meaning&quot;) that many people don&#x27;t question. But it misses the mark because it ignores the parts that are <i>not</i> plausible but actually created the dystopian environment.<p>The cartoon (much more than the book itself) is also a bit grating because I sense some condescending overtones. &quot;Look at all those people who don&#x27;t care about the world but just distract themselves with popular entertainment. How shallow!&quot; Obviously you, the reader, do not belong to this group. And hey, I don&#x27;t disagree <i>per se</i>—I think most popular distractions <i>are</i> shallow and have much better alternatives—but I also think there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with enjoying them. I mean, I follow the news, I care about recent events and where does it get me? Nowhere. I guess I could vote² a bit better, but all it&#x27;s done is sour me on all major candidates. Is this meaningfully better than comfortable ignorance? No, but people tell me it is. And here I am.<p>Really, <i>Brave New World</i> minus the implausible bits and with a larger dash of individual freedom thrown in is pretty much as far from dystopian as it can get. Radical, certainly, and jarring—very different from our current social order—but fundamentally <i>good</i>. It feels like it&#x27;s just a few exaggerated risks thrown in to make leisure and entertainment seem crass and indolent. <i>1984</i>, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t feel all that different from my parents&#x27; tales about the Soviet Union.<p>I know which one <i>I&#x27;m</i> more afraid of!<p>footnotes<p>¹ I&#x27;ve always really disliked this phrase. It&#x27;s one part rationalization and one part a way to keep people down and working even if they don&#x27;t want to. Doing something menial or boring or easily automatable <i>just for the sake of working</i> is not my picture of dignity!<p>² Haha, no I can&#x27;t, because I&#x27;m not a citizen. So I&#x27;d have to become a citizen first. It doesn&#x27;t matter, but it <i>is</i> annoying.",1414094498

Binaries (built by various companies and orgs) comes from someplace else, and are usually called something else. E.g. RedHat calls theirs &quot;IcedTea&quot;. Azul calls their binary distro of OpenJDK &quot;Zulu&quot;.<p>When you get a binary build of OpenJDK from some place (in tar/zip form, or deb or rpm package form), some of those are well built and tested (e.g. Azul&#x27;s Zulu and RedHat&#x27;s IcedTead, and obviously Oracle&#x27;s own JDKs). But some may not be. they may just be a random build from a random point in the source tree, using unknown tool chains and shipped with little or notesting. E.g. the Java 8 version you&#x27;d currently get on the experimental debian:sid repos is base don 8u40: a source tree that is still in flux and not planned to be released as 8u40 until March of 2015.<p>Many people care about running on a JDK version that was actually tested and verified. Right now Zulu is the only binary build of a Java 8 OpenJDK that meets that need. And on MacOS or Windows, it&#x27;s the only one for 7 and 6 as well.",1414094410

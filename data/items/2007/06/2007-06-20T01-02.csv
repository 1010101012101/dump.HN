The buy-side generally deals in securities that have already been issued: the seller is another buy-side firm, not a firm that'll turn that capital into useful products.  (There are exceptions, otherwise investment bankers wouldn't exist, but that's the bulk of the trading that goes on.)  And the secondary market <i>is</i> zero sum - it doesn't produce anything, it just sets prices.<p>I suppose you could argue that more accurate secondary-market prices help allocate capital more effectively when firms make primary security offerings.  That's how I sleep at night. ;-) But as far as I can see, the market is plenty efficient <i>already</i>.  That's why index funds are so popular.<p>I also really dislike the moral-hazard problem inherent in the 2/20 compensation structure for most hedge funds.  When hedge funds make money, they take 20% of the profits, a huge windfall for the fund.  However, when they <i>lose</i> money, it comes out of the capital put up by the original investors.  It's very much a ""heads I win tails you lose"" structure.  The incentive isn't toward better overall performance, it's towards higher variability of returns.  <p>A hedge fund that makes 25% and loses 20% on alternate years ends up being a wash for investors (minus fees), but it nets its manager an average fee of 2.5% for their 20% of profits (ignoring the 2% of assets).  A fund that makes 10% every year, steadily, will end up being worth twice as much for investors after 7 years, but will only make its manager 2% yearly in profit fees.  The incentive isn't towards higher performance, it's towards higher risk-taking.",1182304679

29377,comment,29335,29375,0,0,willarson,,,"Sorry, it just seemed a mite too easy. :) Its pretty hard to find a community worse than lisp, but a big part of that is that lisp is at a very different stage of its lifetime than almost any other language out there.<p>
Python/Ruby/Perl/TclTk et al are very young, and tend to be much more friendly (interestingly many feel that the Ruby crowd is getting a bit antsy these days, an acceptable lisp afterall? never). I'm hard pressed to explain why C is still relatively friendly, but I suspect it is in large part because there are many more C programmers, many more new C programmers, and that C finds people, whereas people find Lisp.",1182302584

I said, ""If it is more clear and consistent, I demand it."" I was merely stating my demand, not arguing with them that Arc is better. I don't know if Arc is better, but I know that if the Community of Arc is better than #lisp that would be a great start.",1182301741
29374,comment,28826,28826,0,0,zach,,,"It's not just ""yes,"" it's ""yes and!""  Accept opportunities, but not simply as they're suggested.  You plus the work, you look for the opportunity within the opportunity, you create something on top of what you're given, and you find a way to make it work better for you.<p>Yes And.

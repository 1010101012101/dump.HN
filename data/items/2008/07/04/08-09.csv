Twitter can easily keep people connected with their environment.<p>I do see value in Twitter even if it is solely through Twhirl and FriendFeed.<p>As Matt mentions Twhirl is a beautiful application. I do not have any followers at Twitter  (frankly there would no need since I only updated twice in the last 1 and 1/2 years  save 100 updates a year ago from a RSS to SMS app I was having cooked by a friend), but I do follow about 13 key players and I love it when the little Twhirl screen pops up with a fresh title and a link.",1215160918

236051,comment,235942,236035,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"The ""anti-freedom argument"" (which should actually be called the pro-proprietary argument, because nobody sane is against free software) is fairly simple: there can be both and both can coexist peacefully. We can (and do) have Linux and Windows, and use them for different things. The market and individuals decide which is better for what task.<p>Some people say Ubuntu is finally a usable desktop OS for average Joe. Even if that's true, it took how many decades for free operating systems to reach that mark? They're at least 20 years behind in crossing the line (though perhaps now gaining ground rapidly).<p>The financial incentive enabled by proprietary software gives us things like Photoshop (sorry, GIMP still sucks) and Illustrator, Flash, Windows or OSX.<p>Certainly nobody would suggest that the open source community be legally prevented from making a Photoshop or Outlook or IE competitor. So why can't we have both and let the market decide? Why must proprietary be evil?",1215160249

The difference there is very noticeable, and quite interesting at the same time. Obviously our programs are only compared when we use the same algorithm.",1215160035

The LA Times reported that his foundation spends five to 10% of its money annually and invests the rest, sometimes in companies it suggests cause environmental degradation and illness in the same poor countries. </i><p>I've just lost all my respect for Richard Stallman. He's a total ass if he thinks he can make FSF look good by bashing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation by spreading what qualifies - by Stallman's own definition - as FUD.<p><i>Update:</i> <a href=""http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/richard-stallman-expert-in-the-art-of-fud/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/richard-stallman-expert-in-the...</a>",1215158485

PAX is not my nomenclature, it is what sorted in-page columnar formats are called in the literature. (It is what the first paper describing them called them.)<p>Not all columnar formats have great CPU streaming performance and even then it is data type dependent. Many columnar formats have significantly worse streaming performance than vector formats because only the latter is primarily optimized for it and column stores will trade that for other things (like format compressibility). And for data types that have no mathematical order of any kind e.g. interval data types, columnar formats effectively degenerate into very inefficient vector formats.

It&#x27;s easy to create the basics of a &quot;wiki,&quot; and while reliably importing documents into a wiki isn&#x27;t easy, it&#x27;s just a starting point. The important features of a Wikipedia (Mediawiki) are an emphasis on links within the site, the ability to view changes across the site, changes on one page, and to see how a page was composed in clean markup, the clean markup also preventing behind the scenes jumbly messes of &quot;structure.&quot; Missing any of these points loses a vital aspect of wikis. The category structure and templates are also important features, supporting what in Wikipedia&#x27;s case is a strong support community that can go well beyond what a formulated menu structure can offer. (Mediawiki has emphatically refused to implement any kind of fine grained access model, this is one area other wikis have advantages.)<p>But now people expect more, they don&#x27;t want to be forced to use markup and they want to simultaneously edit documents in a rich editor, in a social setting where its easy to find and connect with other contributors. This is the current focus of Wikipedia and while other efforts have their own strengths, not connecting finely to Wikipedia&#x27;s developments is, to me anyway, missing the greatest element of development.",1412772912

8426533,comment,8425575,8425575,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"This issue is one of the reasons the Iron Triangle (MacLeod-Gervais-Rao organizational model) is so interesting to me. See also: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/09/28/can-agile-break-the-iron-triangle-can-open-allocation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/09/28/can-agile-bre...</a> .<p>I spent a lot of time investigating this in a number of different organizations. What I found is that most people who think they&#x27;re overworked and have &quot;no time&quot; are spending a lot of time working on the wrong things. They&#x27;ve volunteered for mediocre projects and created too many recurring commitments for themselves. Recurring commitments make it harder to fire you, but they don&#x27;t do much for your career, because doing the same job 20 times doesn&#x27;t deliver much more benefit than doing it once.<p>If you work at a company where everyone works 9 to 8, you also have to work 9 to 8. The good news is that you can still probably get most of your work done in 2 hours, freeing up 9 to network internally and look for better projects, or read books/papers to study up on the skills your next job will require. If you never volunteer (except for a career-advancing project) and avoid recurring commitments, this means you have a lot of time to &quot;learn on the clock&quot;. (Don&#x27;t be dumb and write side-project code at your day job; you can do your exploration/research at your day job to make the side-project work more efficient at home, but it has to be done on your own time and machinery.) This is how most of the programmers who are reinventing themselves as &quot;data scientists&quot; are doing it.<p>Doing more grunt work, here meaning work that you don&#x27;t learn or gain anything from, is a pointless game (for the Clueless). You get tired faster, you&#x27;re more likely to lose social polish and fail politically. The first people fired or PIP&#x27;d in a &quot;low performer initiative&quot; (which is a dishonest layoff) are usually overperformers who worked too hard, got themselves emotionally overinvolved, and lost the political game. It&#x27;s only in a deep cut (10 to 20%) that the company runs out of politically-failed &quot;pain in the ass&quot; employees and start removing the long-term underperformers who&#x27;ve been hiding for years.<p>Of course, there is work (growth-oriented work, in particular) where the returns are exponential and, for that kind of work, you shouldn&#x27;t stop because it&#x27;s 5:00pm. If one programmer is growing at 4% per year and the other one works three times as hard and grows at 12% per year, the difference over 20 years is that the former will be just 2.2 times more productive, and the latter will be 9.6 times more productive. (In capability, if not salary, I&#x27;ve seen programmers grow at <i>30</i> percent per year.) That may not matter for salarymen, but it&#x27;s a big deal if you ever want to go off and start your own thing. The 4%-growth engineer is barely able to justify a senior-level salary; the 12%-growth engineer is a sought-after &quot;10x&quot; engineer.<p>So what&#x27;s the answer? If the work is strategically valuable and growth-oriented, do as much of it as you physically can do well. This doesn&#x27;t mean neglecting your social life or relationships or fitness, because those are important too. It does mean that you shouldn&#x27;t stop just because it&#x27;s 5:00 and you&#x27;re three episodes behind on the Walking Dead. (I&#x27;d say that the average person can handle about 65 hours per week; beyond that, it starts to get unsustainable for most.)<p>For the scut work that&#x27;s not going to help your career or teach you anything, that just gets shuffled around because no one wants to do it, do as little as possible. The politically optimal point, when assigned bad work, seems to be the 35th percentile in quality. Below the 25th percentile, you risk the appearance of having intentionally blown off the grunt work (which is different from just not being well-suited to it, because the former will be taken against you and the latter will be tacitly accepted) but above the 50th, you&#x27;re in danger of doing it too well and getting assigned more of it.<p>The importance is knowing the difference. You need to do just enough of the &quot;dues paying&quot; work to fit in, and avoid recurring commitments as much as you can get away with, but put as much of your work time as possible into the compounding-interest growth-oriented work, and as little into the dead-end grunt work. In Iron Triangle terms, this is why strategy wins out over dedication.",1412771567

If your revenue is derived from advertising then users installing ad blocking software is revenue-equivalent to users pirating your software. The fact that it&#x27;s legal for users to do when piracy is not provides no support for argument that ad-supported services are on stronger financial footing.<p>It is not difficult to foresee a world in which &quot;forging the appearance of a website&quot; is illegal and userscripts and userstyles are forbidden as well. How many sites try very hard to block right click to hide their code?<p>There are five actors that can modify the appearance of a website:<p>* the author,<p>* the server,<p>* the network,<p>* the browser,<p>* the user (instructing a browser&#x27;s add on).<p>By definition the author can do whatever they want.<p>But what if the server started serving slightly different pages, maybe with advertisements? This is happening now with hosted blogs and publishing platforms; it is frowned upon but accepted.<p>If the network changes the content of a page, for example adding advertisements, the network will have to face a lot of bad reactions, so very few networks are doing it now. (see <a href=""http://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-injection/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-inject...</a> )<p>The browser is in a similar situation. When Internet Explorer wanted to modify the received HTML to &quot;enrich it&quot;, there has been a big backslash from authors «Microsoft thinks they can improve my writing. This makes me want to get a gun and go to war.» «With smart tags, Microsoft is able to insert their ads right into competitors’ sites.» (<a href=""http://alistapart.com/article/smarttags"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alistapart.com/article/smarttags</a> )<p>So the authors are against modifications to the way their sites appear. Their remaining problem is _the user_. Authors cannot force the user to see what they produced: users have the freedom to install an ad-blocker or strip the CSS away. But we have to realize that this may be only a temporary situation. With the app-ification of the web, userscripts and userstyles are gone. And the content producers are happy about this.",1412770203

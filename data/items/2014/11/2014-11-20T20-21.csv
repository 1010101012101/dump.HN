8638103,comment,8637572,8637572,0,0,benekastah,,,"> Should any error [in the program] occur, the director could easily edit the states of any brains that have become aware of an anomaly before it spoils the simulation.<p>This seems really problematic to me. Why would you assume that a full-on universe simulator has a concept of a brain? If you&#x27;re in the business of simulating the interactions of nanoparticles, having a &quot;brain&quot; object doesn&#x27;t seem to make much sense. I suppose that you could implement some heuristic to identify minds with some degree of accuracy, but then you&#x27;re getting into some weird territory. Someone wants to model the <i>entire universe</i> just to observe life here on earth? Why assume the author of this system is even aware of us at all?<p>> It could be the case that one planetary civilisation is all that can be simulated, without running into computational capacity issues.<p>Again, why would a system like this be optimized toward the civilisation level?<p>The idea is cool, maybe probable, but this write up seems pretty fanciful.",1416517183

8638094,comment,8637493,8638028,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Any time you install a package (an RPM, deb, .exe, etc.), including from something like yum or apt-get, you are trusting <i>somebody</i> with root access to your system, including the ability to run arbitrary shell commands.<p>This is something to take seriously; but not something to dismiss as entirely unacceptable. It is generally a manageable, and somewhat quantifiable, risk. This is no different than if the Rust developers provided an RPM or deb package for you to install; the same privileges are being granted to them. Though it is the same thing, it doesn&#x27;t seem to generate the same concern as the &quot;pipe this file into a shell&quot; method of installation. In fact, one of the folks who responded to you explained that this problem will be gone once rust is packaged for distribution...but that merely means the commands are different, not that rust developers aren&#x27;t being granted root access to your system.<p>It is possibly even more suspect, in the case of binary packages, since in the case of the shell script, you <i>could</i> download it, look at it, and then run it. A binary package might have modifications that aren&#x27;t included in the source distribution, and it would be difficult for a non-expert to spot those differences (and an expert would need to go looking for them, and might miss them).<p>This is why signed packages are a big deal in the free OS world. At least you know <i>who</i> signed off on your package.<p>In short, you&#x27;re right: It&#x27;s kind of crazy that people grant root access to arbitrary people every time they install software. But, it&#x27;s the way things are done, for now, so we deal with it and only install stuff from people we perceive to be trustworthy.

Someday I&#x27;ll spend a full week at my grandparents.<p>And I&#x27;m realizing, as you aptly said, that the mere act of telling yourself &quot;someday&quot; is enough to comfort you that it will happen, that you shouldn&#x27;t worry about it, until it&#x27;s too late.<p>My grandfather fought in WW2 in the French resistance, leaving his family at the age of 17 to live in the wilderness for 3 years, stealthily blowing up Nazi trains and doing various things like that. He got a fairly prestigious military decoration for it at the end of the war. He never really talked about it when we were kids though - he probably wanted to keep us blissfully ignorant.<p>For about 2 years, my cousin and I talked of taking a few days to sit down, ask him questions about it, get him to share his story - and film the whole thing and produce a short oral history documentary out of it. We kept putting it off because I live in the US, she lives in Switzerland, my grandpa lives in France, and occasions were rare.<p>Then he died last February. Despite a few surgeries, he was in fairly good health at 88 (still drove around, gardened, fixed stuff around the house, etc.). On a Monday morning he felt unwell, on the Wednesday morning he was gone.<p>I&#x27;m trying to minimize those &quot;somedays&quot; now so they don&#x27;t hit me in the face 100x when I&#x27;m 45.

8638080,comment,8637150,8637856,0,0,nkurz,,,"<i>Modern languages and their compilers can usually produce the best possible machine code most of the time.</i><p>This is frequently asserted, but rarely by people who spend much time looking at assembly generated by modern compilers.   The easiest disproof would be to compile the same C or C++ function with different compilers, and benchmark the generated code.   Between CLang, GCC, Intel, and MSVC, I&#x27;d usually expect about a 50% difference (1:1.5) between the fastest and the slowest, with any one of them about equally likely to win or lose on a given function.<p>By the same token, I&#x27;d assume it&#x27;s usually possible to get a 100% speedup by dropping to hand-coded assembly (1:2), and wouldn&#x27;t be surprised by 5x-10x especially if one is allowed to target the features of specific processor family.  Sometimes this can be &#x27;back ported&#x27; to the higher level language once the solution is known, and sometimes it can&#x27;t.  But the potential for a significant speedup over the compiler generated code is still there.  The more valid question is whether any particular case justifies the extra development and maintenance work involved.",1416516981

8638065,comment,8636624,8638010,0,0,schoen,,,"Seems to be an interesting difficult in terms of whether the dangers in food are ones that people consuming it can expect to perceive.  In an era when food poisoning was more common, maybe a lot of people knew quickly whether the food they ate had harmed them; now folks eating junk food might have to wait years to experience some of the adverse effects, and can&#x27;t really relate those effects to a particular purchase or product or vendor.<p>I worry about a similar thing for computer security.  A lot of the threats that we used to think about in terms of, say, viruses, wanted to get the user&#x27;s <i>attention</i> either through innocuous mischief, or by showing off with spectacularly destructive behavior, like deleting files or crashing the machine or even erasing the hard drive.  &quot;Look at me, I infected your computer!&quot;  And later we saw adware which tries to get the user&#x27;s attention for marketing purposes (which is definitely still a thing).<p>But now a whole lot of attackers have a goal of long-term, pervasive, convert compromise, to be used selectively later on -- botnets for DDoS attacks and spam, keyloggers for delayed financial fraud or government surveillance, &quot;advanced persistent threats&quot; to compromise infrastructure, maybe in service of transitively compromising other infrastructure.<p><a href=""http://www.isaca.org/chapters2/Norway/NordicConference/Documents/14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isaca.org/chapters2/Norway/NordicConference/Docum...</a><p>So in the past there was a common expectation that a virus would do something that the user could notice, or else what&#x27;s the point?

My main realization regarding the way food is treated in each country is that in France, the relationship with food is conditioned culturally very strongly since the moment you&#x27;re born. When you grow up as a French person in a culturally French family, you grow up in an environment where you constantly hear about what foods go and don&#x27;t go with one another, how you should eat, etc. You hear this through your own family, through meals at schools, through meals you share when you go to your friend&#x27;s house, and so on. Little things like &quot;you&#x27;re supposed to eat bread with your salad&quot;, &quot;we&#x27;ve already had meat for lunch let&#x27;s not have it for dinner&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t eat with your hands&quot;, etc. For the first 18 years of your life, you hear these things on an everyday basis to the point that when you start living on your own, they&#x27;re part of your subconscious. If you ate pizza on Monday, you&#x27;re not going to eat it again on Tuesday because you&#x27;ll hear your grandma&#x27;s voice in your head that says &quot;You already had pizza last night, eat some vegetables tonight&quot;. When you have dinner with your friends in college, you&#x27;re likely to still cook something fairly healthy because most people share that upbringing with you. And then when you raise a family of your own, you yourself repeat these things and the cycle continues.<p>This culture has evolved and been passed from generation to generation over centuries, and the result is that the average French person has a fairly strong instinct for &quot;eating healthily&quot; because of this, even though they&#x27;re not compulsively counting calories at every meal. Their cultural baggage means they can just cook according to their gut, and their meals are likely to be balanced over time. The same is probably true for other countries with strong food cultures such as other mediterranean countries, Japan/South Korea, and so on.<p>Such a culture does not exist to such an extent in the US. I&#x27;ve found the contrast to be pretty stark - when I eat with French friends, there&#x27;s an entire set of manners and habits that are never expressed but mutually understood, which does not happen when I eat with most American friends. As a teenager, I lived in the US with a host family for a summer who never ate together - different family members would just pick and choose from the fridge at different times of the day as they saw fit, with no regards for whether their food intake was balanced or not; then maybe once or twice a week, they&#x27;d have a barbecue all together. This would be completely inconceivable in a French family.<p>That being said, France is changing, families are becoming more and more multicultural, and things like fast food restaurants are changing norms.",1416516397

8638014,comment,8637493,8637750,0,0,Jabbles,,,"I would like to contrast the underlying philosophy here to that of Go.<p>As you may be aware, there is limited support for versioning APIs using &quot;go get&quot; (Go&#x27;s nearest equivalent of this). The developers of Go argue that the maintenance of your dependencies is your responsibility, and you should clone everything you need to your own environment. That gives you ultimate control, allowing you to pull and update them as you require, modify and bugfix as you see fit, and makes it hard, if not impossible, to end up relying on two packages with different versions.<p>If a project B depends on project A, then they must collaborate in some way to make sure that there are no breaking changes introduced between (minor) versions. If another project C also depends on A, then they must both use the same version of A if they are to be used together. The maintainers of A, B and C all have a duty to ensure that their code remains up-to-date and backwards compatible.<p>It seems that Rust values a different freedom. By specifying the exact version you require, there is no need to keep separate projects in sync. The flexibility comes at a cost; you may find you have different versions of many dependencies. Because they are not required to, maintainers may neglect the tedious task of keeping their projects&#x27; dependencies up-to-date, requiring bugfixes in multiple places in your own codebase.<p>Clearly, some of the smartest minds in our industry disagree what the best tradeoff is.

You will constantly stumble over cases where the compiler isn&#x27;t doing what you expected. For example, it might be reloading memory in an inner loop instead of caching its value in a register outside the loop because its alias analysis was inconclusive. Or not enough inlining is happening where you expected it. Or there&#x27;s too much inlining like when a side exit to a cold function is inlined within an inner loop. This last case exemplifies a general issue that ahead-of-time compilers have with identifying code paths as hot or cold. You can sometimes give hints to the compiler, but you must verify that the hints were actually taken in the way you expected.<p>Obviously you only dive into this level of detail with a piece of code once you have reason to believe it&#x27;s warranted (e.g. profiler information).",1416515740

If you fuck up and leave password auth enabled and a password set, and you fuck up and don&#x27;t have monitoring on failed authentication and something like fail2ban or denyhosts, then fwknop is yet another thing that you&#x27;d have to fuck up before you&#x27;re wide open to the brute-force crawlers.

Simply put, technology has made sex <i>a lot safer</i> at the same time as it has made food <i>a lot more dangerous</i>. Sex is safer (in the sense of creating fewer risks and uncertainties), as we all know, thanks to developments like condoms, STD testing, contraception, and legalized abortion. Meanwhile, food is a lot more dangerous, thanks to food science being used to create &quot;hyperpalatable&quot; junk food--cf. Paul Graham&#x27;s &quot;The Acceleration of Addictiveness.&quot;[1] As a 20-something in the U.S., I look around me and see obesity as an almost guaranteed outcome once people reach a certain age (with diabetes and heart disease not far behind)--and like many of my peers, I&#x27;m spooked.<p>In response to this, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say people have made healthy eating into a new Categorical Imperative. Instead, they&#x27;ve become paranoid and superstitious about what it is in modern food that&#x27;s hurting them. Hence we get ridiculous cargo cults like gluten-free, organic, anti-GMO, everything Dr. Oz pushes, etc. Meanwhile, evidence-based approaches to the issue have not yet produced a diet that is optimal, practical, and that provides the level of enjoyment that we&#x27;re used to from food.

But nowadays, especially on AWS, there&#x27;s no point in a configuration that isn&#x27;t automatically reproducible - in which case, why not harden all your machines?<p>Then you avoid having a single point of failure. If and when a single SSH key is compromised, there are a limited number of hosts that key had access to - and unless that&#x27;s the log server, you have secured logs so you can figure out what happened. Different keys can have different capabilities, rather than a one-size-fits-all policy on the bastion. It makes it harder for an attacker to know where to get the boss&#x27;s keys. And you can expand your system geographically without the performance compromises of a VPN; your servers already make encrypted, secured calls to each other (over SSH, SSL or a very small number of vetted protocols), expose only those ports that are actively used.

However, I am looking for something a bit gentler. That process will work for the top 10% but the rest will struggle and at the end of the day they need to write an x86 code generator so without knowing how to write assembly they are in trouble.",1416513619

Any chance of that happening?<p>Edit: Nevermind. You have the comments setup so you only see the top level and have to tap to see the child comments.

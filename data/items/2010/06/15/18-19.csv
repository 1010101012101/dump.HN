1433525,comment,1433108,1433108,0,0,juliusdavies,,,"#29 No Tables.  How does that help performance?  Sure on very large pages that might help, since the table usually won't render until the </table> has been sent, but maybe the better tip would be ""avoid very large pages"" (i.e. 100KB or more of HTML).  DIV based layout also degrade if text in a single cell is very large, whereas Table based layout is robust against that.  Also, I don't understand why <TABLE> is bad, but this is okay!?!?!<p><pre><code>  <div class='table'>\n  <div class='tr'>\n    <div class='td'>1</div><div class='td'>2</div><div class='td'>3</div>\n  </div>\n  <div class='tr'>\n    <div class='td'>a</div><div class='td'>b</div><div class='td'>c</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</code></pre>\nWhich is what DIV/FLOAT layout usually ends up becoming.  If your DIV/FLOAT layout doesn't map to a structure like that, you're probably doing something wrong!<p>Finally, has IE fixed the ""we double the padding on floats"" issue?  Because float-driven layout with that bug is pretty hard, since IE will double your paddings while the other browsers don't.<p>I do know that proudly espousing TABLE in a job interview can cost you the job.  But aside from that TABLE is very effective for most layouts.  I do avoid TABLE inside TABLE of course, that's a code smell, but top level TABLE is the right tool most of the time.  Do anti-TABLE people also avoid Excel?",1276628386

One can differ about this or that word, of course, but the broader point is that lists of this type are helpful and fun to review.",1276628276

You're saying that instead of using a poorly-documented mencode filter to fade a video in and out,  you'd rather have to write your own filter or not be able to use mencode for the job at all?<p>While working on a project with a tight deadline, I've needed complex functionality that wasn't well-documented, and I've needed complex functionality that wasn't there. When it wasn't there, I was forced to produce complex functionality that wasn't documented. If I'm generous enough to release that for others to use, reference, and modify for free, then the last thing I want to hear is somebody bitching about how I didn't document it well enough for them. I have other things to do, and for me it was a one-off project.<p>In a pinch, source code is documentation, and it's pretty hard to make an argument that undocumented source code is worse than nothing at all. At least then when you're implementing your nicely-documented tool (because you'd rather have documentation than <i>get stuff done</i>), you'll have a reference implementation to look at and test against.<p>Note: I'm not arguing that documentation isn't important, I absolutely agree that it is.

De-duplication: When communities coalesce around similar popular ideas, it's easy to understand patterns of requirements. Traditional request processes are black holes for this reason.\n2. More Democratic Prioritization: Since there isn't a good way for smaller customers to coalesce, PMs are often stuck implementing requests from their largest customers. This solves that problem.\n3. Partner promotion: As a platform provider, you want to be able to support complementary partners. Unfortunately, partners often don't know what to build, or have poorly targeted products. If you were building in the force.com ecosystem, you could start your customer development right in the salesforce.com community.

I printed a shipping label using Paypal, making sure to use the correct account. When I printed a second shipping label, I assumed it would use the most-recently-used account (the last 4 digits differed by only one number), but it instead defaulted to the overdrawn account.<p>Only a few minutes later, I noticed this and immediately called Paypal. They said that it was too late to cancel or assign a new source for the payment, even though I told them the payment would be rejected by my bank. I deposited from my other bank account to my Paypal account enough money to cover the charge, and they still couldn't cancel the debit to my overdrawn account. A few days later, I received an email message:<p><i>Your bank has declined the funds transfer because your account did not have sufficient funds available. We will automatically re-attempt this transfer in 3 business days. Please fund your bank account immediately to ensure this transaction can be completed.</i><p>What?! I already had enough money in my Paypal account to cover the charge, but they instead chose to <i>recharge</i> the same account in 3 days? I called them again as soon as I received this email, but they said they could not change this transaction, that it was their policy and that the process could not be altered. Three days later, lo and behold, it was declined again, and they finally took the money from my Paypal account. Meanwhile, my bank charged me $70 for the two declined charges, all for an under-$4 shipping label.<p>I will be avoiding Paypal in the future.

There's millions of people that have a directory of document type NNN that want to get some aspect of those documents into another form, but either (a) they don't have resources to get it done, or (b) the job/process isn't large enough for them to bother their IT folks with.  If we can nail the UI, we should be able to capture some large chunk of this.<p>(b) The relative waste of resources spent on non-core work related to extracting data from documents in medium-sized, usually internal software projects.  These folks don't like spending the up-front money to license software to get the job done, and they don't like having to understand the minutiae of the processing involved; i.e. ""I want text/images/form data/three number from the second page of each of these 10K documents, and I don't want to blow a week on figuring that out.""<p>(c) Manual entry. Organizations with very large document processing workflows currently spend millions shipping documents to ""overseas"" keying shops (almost all in south Asia).

1433386,comment,1432386,1432386,0,0,AndrewLuecke,,,"Firstly, if you can access your root domain, but not the subdomains, you have configured something wrong (unless you are using multiple IP's). That's YOUR fault, and neither Prgmr or Linode is likely to help much there (although in both cases, people in the channels are more than happy to provide some suggestions).<p>Now, in regards to stability, I find both to be equal. The difference is, that for the cost of 1x Linode, you could buy 2x Prgmr nodes in different location and run them simultaneously to provide much better stability.<p>Maybe you should jump onto IRC, but from the sounds of things, you may not have the experience to administer a Prgmr Node. Linode is easier to learn with, but is much more expensive<p>Just onto Freenode IRC / #prgmr, and people will help. But honestly, there was a short server outage a month ago, but your current server issues are likely configuration faults on your side.",1276625454

1433382,comment,1431602,1431602,0,0,fr0man,,,"You might want to work through some ASP.NET MVC tutorials using your language of choice before jumping into Django or Rails.  That will give you an easier entry point to learning MVC (which is quite different conceptually from ASP.NET Webforms).  Then you can read through some language tutorials and decide whether you prefer Ruby or Python.\nASP.NET MVC is nearly identical to Rails minus ActiveRecord, so you could easily jump from there to Rails development.\nThough if you're going to be developing on a Windows box, Django is much more of a first class citizen there than Rails.  I also had a ton of deployment problems trying to deploy Rails to a Windows server.  Just a tip: no matter where you dev, don't try deploying to a Windows Server machine unless you have to.  Linux plays much more nicely with both Django and Rails.<p>Edit: Anyone care to explain the downvoting?  I'm not whining; I'm just genuinely curious.  I thought my post was fairly informative, and I tried to give love to both Django and Rails.  I had problems going from C# Webforms to Rails, partly because I was a noob, partly because I was trying to learn a new framework (Rails), a new language (Ruby, which is very different from C#), and partly because Ruby and Rails both have some configuration issues on Windows.  It's nothing you can't overcome, but added all together it made for a very steep entry to becoming a Rails developer.  The OP sounded like he was coming from a very similar situation to me.",1276625181

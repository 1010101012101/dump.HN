Strategic/acquisition values are typically much higher than investment values. eg, as of today, Instagram is worth more to Facebook than it is to Sequoia, because Facebook gets strategic value in addition to market value. Also note that an investor with a signed term sheet would be fully aware that acquisition discussions were taking place, as well as what valuation range they were in. I would be surprised if Sequoia did not go into this with eyes wide open. They win either way - an instant 2X multiple on investment (and a crazy high IRR), or a highly desirable company that they believe has growth potential. Call me jealous.""",1333994329

When I open the G+ app on my iPhone it wants to upload all the new photos it can find on the phone.  I would imagine the Facebook app does the same thing, but I don't know.  The OS has cloud storage for photos baked in.  When I plug the phone into my computer, Dropbox wants to automatically find and upload the photos.<p>Everyone is trying to get into this, and for good reason, I think.<p>My family is filled with people that always have access to a camera and to the internet via their phone.  We're spread out geographically and don't get to see each other very often.  There is a HUGE opportunity to bring us closer together that would be greatly valuable to us.  I would love it if part of our daily routine included looking at all of the photos anyone in the family has taken in the last day.<p>There are lots of solutions for us to do this, but for whatever reason, nothing has taken hold.  Maybe everything is too manual, or maybe social networks are still focused too much on the browser and not enough on mobile.  But for whatever reason, it's not happening for us. I suspect we are not alone and I think the explosion of people trying to get me to buy into putting my photos on their free service is indicative of this.",1333994297

Photography is a business, and everyone is trying to make a deal to make a buck. If Coke offered $100, that's their prerogative, and it's up to the author to either haggle up higher, or refuse them flatly.<p>Personally, I see no reason why the author was so offended -- the emails weren't rude, they weren't demanding, and the email person ""L"" was almost apologetic for having only $100 to spend.

Conduits are basically the next step from iteratees. Iteratees are essentially a functional/compositional way of dealing with I/O. Prior to iteratees, you essentially had to choose between using lazy I/O and ignoring the problems or writing C in Haskell if you needed performance and determinism. Conduits take the benefits of iteratees, simplify the coding and give you more concrete guarantees about when resources will be acquired and released.<p>In fact conduits/pipes/iteratees are all more useful than arrows outside academia. The only library you're likely to encounter arrows in is HXT and there are other XML libraries. You're likely to encounter one of the conduit/pipe/iteratee libraries using any Haskell web framework and probably any other system doing a lot of I/O where guarantees need to be had.<p>I haven't yet seen evidence that arrows are actually useful at all outside very limited circumstances. The difficulty of learning them and using them is exacerbated by the fact they have something like 11 laws you must obey to create your own arrow versus three for a monad. There's also a lot more going on in the pretty arrow syntax than in do-notation, which desugars pretty easily by comparison. It would all be justified, I suppose, if using arrows enabled crazy functionality that isn't available via simpler abstractions, but that just doesn't seem to be the case.",1333993616

We wanted to create a cross platform application with the easiest file-sharing experience. Drag and drop the files on the avatar of the person you want to send them to. and voila, the files are sent.<p>During the weekend I posted on HN to get some feedback on our project and was happy to see we got some awesome feedback ( http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3780777 ). The testing page ( http://dl.dropbox.com/u/149780/Dropsend%20beta.jpg ) got more than 1200 Unique Visitors in 8h with a CTR of 21% ! By the end of the weekend we had a working prototype that was able to send files both locally and through the web.<p>Since we were just there to have fun and took SW more like a hackathon, we were really surprised when we were announced as the Winners of the weekend ( Ze winning pitch deck: http://speakerdeck.com/u/dropdock/p/dropdock-startup-weekend-winning-pitch )<p>After a lot of thinking, we decided to take the projet further and really launch the service, thus creating Dopdock!<p>We are currently refactoring the code, redesigning the prototype and adding some features ( Encrypted transfers, Send to non Dropdock users, etc ). The plan is to launch Dropdock by the end of April. That's where you come in, we need tech oriented / startup enthusiasts to give us feedback on our beta because we think you guys will be the ones benefiting the most from our service.<p>So take a look at http://getdropdock.com to watch a demo of Dropdock and why not signup for the beta if you like it! Any feedback is more than welcome, either on the landing page or the application.<p>If you have read up to this point, you get an extra thank you!<p>TL;DR: Took Startup Weekend as a hackaton, pitched a simple idea, won the competition to our surprise, decided to continue the project. Need beta tester! http://getdropdock.com/<p>Cheers,\nSyl<p>PS: My Tech co-founder blogged about the experience, you can read it @ http://maximebf.com/2012/04/startup-weekend/",1333993003

I'm going to go through it in its entirety.<p>I've tried to put some tools together several times (trying to integrate with vim) without success. Mostly my approach boils down to being more aware of the commit history as I navigate. When I find myself in a new codebase I start with browsing the initial commits. Then as I go over the codebase I aggressively use <i>git log <path></i>, and might drill down to look at specific, tantalizing commits.<p>One of my project ideas is a 'wikipedia for open source' where anybody can browse the code for open source projects both in space and in time (like emacs seems to allow), and add annotations to specific revisions. While reading, annotations from previous revisions are rendered as well, but every annotation would give some indication of age (like '350 days ago' on HN) which would help the reader gauge if it might be out of date. This would allow readers to collaboratively say, ""read this snapshot first if you're new to the project"" and so on.<p>I also try to make the logs in my projects easier to read. Here's how I got started with that: <a href=""http://akkartik.name/codelog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.name/codelog.html</a><p>IMO the big reason lots of great hackers mistrust code comments is that when you add a comment it hangs around forever by default, unless someone takes the time to decide to delete it. Attaching comments to the commit log or to annotations on a specific revision helps with this.<p>---<p><i>""I wrote a blog post where all the code samples in the article reflect files tracked in a version-control system, evolutions in the code samples are different commits, and the text of the article itself is taken from specially-annotated text in the commit messages.""</i><p>Compare <a href=""http://akkartik.name/countPaths.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.name/countPaths.html</a> :)<p>You can make your approach more maintainable if you give up on keeping the prose coherent. The biggest problem with documentation is that <i>it doesn't get written</i> most of the time. I focus on mechanisms that make it more likely I will provide that one key sentence for future readers. And -- like in wikipedia -- I assume the reader is reading critically enough to be able to handle glitches.",1333992991

I had it in my checked luggage but still made the point to declare it was there to avoid the hassle of an untimely search later. They took my bag to a spot off to the side to open it up. They glanced at the crossbow for about 5 sec. However, they were much more interested in the alarm clock I also had. (With as much travel as I did to Europe, I had purchased one there that had the correct electrical plug) They spent a good 15 minutes scanning and weighing it to determine that it was just a standard alarm clock. But I don't even want to think about what that same bag I had back then would do to security today.<p>Also, the rules are not followed with any sort of consistency.

Yep.<p>> When Google bought YT it was a small team of people and a pretty nascent product that people really loved, and the usage numbers were out of control.<p>Like most startup acquisitions, the team size is relatively small and there is significant traction in the market with headroom to mature their footprint.<p>> They left the product mostly untouched and let it grow on its own. Though there was major criticism at the time, it is one of the best tech acquisitions of the past decade.<p>This is not going to be one of the best tech acquisitions of the next decade. YouTube helped to propel Google into content. It also helped to commoditise web video in a massive way: reminiscent of the way which Google commoditised search (YouTube is probably just short of being a byword for online video at this point).<p>Instagram is a photo service in a sea of other photo services. Photography has been around on the web in meaningful ways for a long time. Flickr lost out to Facebook in the community stakes, and Instagram is doing great in whatever-the-fuck market it's in (the share-to-my-twitter-followers market?), but this is not Google acquiring YouTube.<p>Bookmark this comment.

It really feels like staring cthulhu in the face.<p>TLDR: <i>Breast cancers, for instance, have been shown to harbor at least 1,700 different mutations, but only three of them showed up in at least 10% of patients, with the great majority of them being unique to each patient. The most recent study in Nature discussed above shows that even a single subtype of breast cancer that is generally treated clinically more or less the same, TNBC, varies wildly (and almost continuously) in the genomic changes and mutations each tumor has. Not only that, but each TNBC is in essence several diseases, because each TNBC is made up of many different clones that have evolved as the tumor itself grew, progressed, and evolved. All of this occurs even before the tumor has been subjected to any treatment at all. As if thats not bad enough, it would appear that tumors are a mosaic of groups of many different tumor cell types that develop through branching evolution such that metastases can be very different from the primary tumor and even different regions of the primary tumor can be very different from each other, so much so that finding a favorable prognosis signature on a core biopsy means only that that one area biopsied has that gene signature. Large areas elsewhere in the tumor could have the unfavorable prognosis signature.</i><p>And even more interesting if you look at the history of a tumor the mutations goes back for a fairly long time, possibly on the order of 30+ years.  While it may not be an actual cure, removing abnormal cells early may be more effective than trying to treat cancer in the last 1-10% of it's lifetime when it's already become a diversified killing machine.",1333992434

Millions of people around the world love the Instagram app and the brand associated with it, and our goal is to help spread this app and brand to even more people.<p>We think the fact that Instagram is connected to other services beyond Facebook is an important part of the experience. We plan on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks, the ability to not share your Instagrams on Facebook if you want, and the ability to have followers and follow people separately from your friends on Facebook.<p>These and many other features are important parts of the Instagram experience and we understand that. We will try to learn from Instagram's experience to build similar features into our other products. At the same time, we will try to help Instagram continue to grow by using Facebook's strong engineering team and infrastructure.<p>This is an important milestone for Facebook because it's the first time we've ever acquired a product and company with so many users. We don't plan on doing many more of these, if any at all.

Same for any metal tube that's threaded or otherwise easily attached to a firearm barrel.  (""Silencer"" is a misnomer; they are not silent; they generally reduce noise by roughly 20-30 dB.)  Even possession of (1) a gun, (2) a soda bottle, and (3) duct tape, in close proximity, would motivate the ATF to charge you with a firearms crime.  Unlike many european countries where such devices are sold without a license and it's considered rude to hunt without one, in the U.S., hysteria over organized and gang crime caused many things to be irrationally banned or strictly regulated, including suppressors and switchblades.  [2]<p>There's also the ""rifle"" vs ""short barreled rifle"" classification.  The term AR15 is a category of firearms that can range from stockless (nothing to rest against the shoulder) and very short barreled (circa 5-8""), to long range variants that have shoulder stocks and barrels 22"" or more.  If you buy a rifle variant of an AR15 and buy a short barrel, you've committed a crime.  The receiver (the central metal piece that accepts the ammo magazine), because it was originally part of a rifle, is forever classified as a rifle receiver.  By converting it into a handgun-like firearm, legally speaking you have converted it into a SBR, or short-barreled rifle, which requires beaucoup paperwork in order to be legal.<p>In contrast, if you start with a handgun-classified variant of the AR15 [1], no special paperwork is required.<p>tl;dr : there are some absurd classifications of objects as firearms, or firearms as more heavily regulated types of firearms, that a reasonable person would not understand or comprehend.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bushmaster.com/catalog_carbon15_AZ-C15P97.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bushmaster.com/catalog_carbon15_AZ-C15P97.asp</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade#Postwar_knives_and_the_stilletto_switchblade"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade#Postwar_knives_and_...</a>",1333991317

And if it costs more to buy the patents than they recoup with when they win, or do not lose, the suits, how does it make economic sense to buy them?<p>Then again, maybe they're considering it an investment in their ongoing campaign to extort the android ecosystem.",1333991192

3817859,comment,3815854,3815854,2,0,kanchax,,,"I agree that a purely platonic relationship between a man and a woman is impossible. If exists I suppose not that the brain of the people implied is fundamentally different than mine but rather they have developed a part of their brain that masks their now unconscious desires. From those desires will grow a head-start appreciation for the other sex (or same) that those of the your sex (or other) will not have.<p>If your desire is quenched then not much will happen. If it is not, then you will of course search for ways to quench it. Dopamine. The result depends on vision of the world. I have personally left behind the race for women and now focus on the race for coolness, if you will. Ultimately it is the same either way to my feelings but in my tribe coolness is better than sex.",1333991132

The vast majority (95%) of our patients do not receive immediate load dental implants.  They receive their implant and then travel back for treatment 4-6 months later (after the bone has fused to the implant).  The great part is they still save money even with the second visit and this includes the cost of their travel.<p>I appreciate your costs to become a dentist...I've felt the burden of student loans and it is tough to dig yourself out.<p>Dental Departures is globalization plain and simple:  dentistry & medical services are no longer immune.

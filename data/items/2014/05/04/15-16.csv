7694675,comment,7689579,7691161,2,0,breuleux,,,"Good questions. Let me try to answer them.<p>> Imagine the human-level ai had resources to run hundreds of variants of itself.<p>The first human-level AI will probably be hosted on cutting-edge hardware that costs billions of dollars. So no, it won&#x27;t have the resources to do this. Even if it wasn&#x27;t this expensive, it&#x27;s not exactly sitting around a vat of free computronium that it can do anything with. If my AI takes up 10% of my computing resources, why am I going to give it the remaining 90%? How is it going to hack or pay for servers to simulate itself on? Is the first human-level AI a computer whiz, just because it runs on one? But let&#x27;s assume it can and will do what you describe.<p>> And imagine that it had no compunction about killing copies of itself that underperformed. How long would it take to get improvement of 10-100x under that scenario?<p>If the AI was trained using a variant of natural selection to begin with, it won&#x27;t improve itself on its own terms any faster than we improve it or its competitors on our own terms. If the AI wasn&#x27;t trained that way, then probably never, because that&#x27;s not how these things work.<p>> Once it has a full understanding of what works, the upgrades are instant from there on out.<p>Your scenario is still based on several dubious assumptions. If the AI is a neural network modelled after human brains, its &quot;source code&quot; would be a gigantic data structure constantly updated by simple feedback processes. It is dubious the AI will have true read access to itself, in part because there&#x27;s no need to give it access, and in part because it&#x27;s hardware overhead to probe a circuit comprehensively (it would be easy to read the states of all neurons on conventional hardware, but all of conventional hardware is overhead if you&#x27;re only interested in running a particular type of circuit). Even if it could read itself, a &quot;full understanding&quot; of any structure requires a structure orders of magnitude larger. Where is it going to find these resources?<p>Long story short, a human-level AI probably won&#x27;t be able to understand its own brain any better than any human can. Now, we will certainly have statistics and probes all over the AI to help us figure out what&#x27;s going on. But unless we see fit to give access to the probing network to the AI (why?), the AI will <i>not</i> have that information.<p>> Why would it do this? Because any goal you give it would be optimized by being smarter.<p>Unfortunately, any resources it expends in becoming smarter are resources it does not spend optimizing our goals. If <i>we</i> run hundreds of variants of AI and kill those that underperform, which ones do you think will prevail? The smart AI that tries to become smarter? Or the just-as-smart AI that focuses on the task completely and knocks the ball out of the park? The AI won&#x27;t optimize itself unless it has the time and resources to do it without an overall productivity loss and <i>before</i> we find a better AI. For human-level AI, that&#x27;s a tall order. A very tall order.",1399218951

7694654,comment,7692359,7692359,4,0,ryandrake,,,"I&#x27;ve always found typeface selection to be totally baffling. Usually, when just writing a document or putting together a quick web page, I&#x27;ll use whatever is the default. I can&#x27;t be bothered to pick between the 40-50 or so fonts that are installed by default, let alone the thousands available free over the web or for purchase.<p>When it comes to putting together the shipping product or released document, I feel like I have only two choices: 1. Consult a magical &quot;UX expert&quot;. Only this mystical being, who speaks secret incantations, and has access to access some design tome somewhere, can tell you what the exact right typeface should be. Or, 2. Pick from generic pre-designed templates (designed by the magicians, no doubt) and just paint-by-numbers into your product.<p>I wish there was a way to take this magic step out of designing.<p>The basic premise of this article seems to be that &quot;Typefaces have personality&quot;. There are actually a couple of examples presented:<p>* Trade Gothic is no-nonsense<p>* Bell Gothic is dynamic and outspoken<p>* Slab serif typefaces are known for their distinct personality<p>* Franklin Gothic is stoic, sturdy, strong<p>* Souvenir is playful, casual, a little aloof, and very pretty<p>* Dax is an informal, modern, and bright typeface<p>* Bernhard Modern is classy, quiet, sophisticated, and even a touch intimate<p>So, who classifies these personalities? Where are they documented, so that I, as a non-designer, can look them up and use them correctly? This guide expects the reader to already know this typeface-to-peronality mapping.<p>I&#x27;d love a resource that lets you just look this stuff up. &quot;If you&#x27;re making an online newsletter about plants, use typefaces A, B, and C together, but never D and E, and don&#x27;t make C bold. If you&#x27;re making a poster for a concert for a new age marimba player, use typefaces F and G.&quot; That would be great.<p>Even better than a rule book, a more systematic process that gets you from subject matter to the right font, that is understandable and repeatable for non-designers would be perfect.<p>Anyone have any suggested reading?",1399218716

It would take some thought to figure out a way to make it work as well as the current hashing system. Perhaps &quot;pointless&quot; was a careless choice of words, but the incentive is to put all those cycles to a use that had more value for society, apart from the value of creating bitcoin itself. I forget the exact order of magnitude, but iirc it&#x27;s something like tens of millions of dollars of electricity being used by miners each year, for no other purpose than to verify the blockchain. It&#x27;d be convenient if we could still have cryptocurrency, but all the computing power was going into something like BOINC instead. Hashing is used for good reasons, as you point out, but it&#x27;s a wasteful use of resources, in my opinion. Even if it wasn&#x27;t the best cryptocurrency, something that would crash and die with new scientific/mathematical advances, I&#x27;d still consider it successful if it got all those resources working on more valuable problems for a while.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a half-baked idea.

Not discussed in this paper, we also stored the content of each of our S4LRU-like queues in storage levels each capable of higher concurrency: origin storage cluster, local NAS, host JBOD HDD, host SSD, host ramdisk. We didn&#x27;t use LRU, but something that works notably better for video, still not found in papers.<p>HD video files are very large compared to available storage for cache queues, and moving HD content among layers is expensive and slow. LRU causes a lot of churn and efficiently distributing large content across &quot;collaborative&quot; collections of edge servers with comparatively smaller caches presents a tough packing problem.<p>As a self-funded video delivery network bootstrapping off our own organic revenue, we had to solve these in order to wholesale to CDNs private labeling and reselling our video delivery at huge scale.  Our combination of approaches let us beat all published papers on cache efficiency (as of mid 2000s), using a set of computationally inexpensive heuristics.<p>It&#x27;s been cool to watch CloudFlare independently discover and publish ideas from that bag of tricks, while the traditional CDNs continue to operate less efficiently. I was surprised by this paper&#x27;s discovery that FB is still not using what this paper calls &quot;collaborative&quot; edge caching.  One day the big guys may wake up and find themselves no longer competitive.",1399215660

Consider what things look like to a conservative christian in favor of small government, living in a town whose industrial base has been nuked and who is now living through a construction bust, with no obvious &quot;next thing&quot; in sight, except perhaps uprooting their families to the Dakotas for oil jobs.<p>If we don&#x27;t make room for them, there will, eventually, be war.",1399215606

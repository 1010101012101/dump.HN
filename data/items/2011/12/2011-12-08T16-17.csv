3329864,comment,3328995,3329208,3,0,peter_l_downs,,,"> It may seem completely insensitive to argue against helping disabled students, but it seems to be happening at the expense of the gifted students.<p>As phillmv pointed out, this is a false dichotomy. If somehow these two were mutually exclusive, I would argue that (if anything) spending on gifted students hurts disabled students. Like pragmatic, I also have some experience with programs for the learning disabled and for the gifted. My twin brother Henry is extremely ""intellectually disabled"" (he has severe Autism and cannot speak English or take care of himself).I tested into my school district's gifted program in 4th grade. The gifted programs at the schools in the district seem very well funded, while the care my brother was bad enough that we moved Henry to a private school.<p>> If we as a nation are making a decision to cut funding to these gifted students, are we at the same time making a decision that jeopardizes the advancement of our society as a whole.?<p>Don't be ridiculous. Gifted programs are pretty useless. The truly gifted will find time to work on what they're good at, no matter the circumstances. Speaking from personal experience as a student in my district's gifted programs, most of them are wastes of time and money because they don't allow students to explore what they're interested in.<p>My elementary school's gifted program was worthless - we gifted students skipped social studies (like pragmatic) and learned... all about Louis and Clark's journeys. If you weren't interested, too bad. The program did not suffer from lack of funding - We had guest speakers and access to the internet - but lack of good design.<p>In middle school, we got to skip one class a week to work on whatever we wanted (within limits). Every week there were a couple of different projects that we could work on. My favorite were the lego mindstorms, but I also really enjoyed some of our literature units. The program was extremely well done - give students a chance to miss a class they dislike to focus on something they might, while still exposing them to different areas of knowledge.<p>Unfortunately, the Highschool's program was terrible. Taking the place of a free period, we had a curriculum set without any input from the students. There were no grades, but we were expected to attempt to do well anyway, regardless of whether or not the area of study was interesting (usually not). Again, it didn't suffer from lack of money, but fundamental problems in how that money was used.<p>About nine out of ten gifted students at my school dropped out of the program after the first year of Highschool because it was such a waste of time. All of these kids are intelligent and hard-working - they quit because they realized they could spend their time more efficiently.<p><i></i>DISCLAIMER<i></i> - This is all based off of personal experience. I cannot speak for all gifted programs in all schools.",1323363370

Example:<p><i>the color of the margin should be the same as the background color of the content</i><p>This after insisting on a sufficient inactive margin, and going on to say the technology doesn't exist. The thought ends with the conclusion of a one-inch-ish black margin.<p>But wait: what if a tablet DID run its display area to the edge? just with the understanding among developers that any user activity within a specified margin would be ignored, either for lack of sensors or programed disuse. Bingo: Apple's odd requirements of no margin (per se) and no black is satisfied and surpassed by a superior user experience of relevant, dynamic borders; anything from automatic color matching to extending a background image to the edges or even putting useful dynamic information & imagery in the margin may/would be preferred to a space-occupying dead black zone. ...then Samsung patents the idea, leaving Apple with, well, a dead black space-occupying margin.<p>Methinks the term ""malicious obedience"" applies.

Our eyes haven't had a problem staying focused inside these rectangles.<p>The big draw for rounded corners is comfort. But we've been using sharp rectangular folders, binders, magazines, etc. for decades without complaint.<p>Apple used the rounded corner to great effect, and for now it seems like the only possible design choice.

It will get you started down the path and from there you can use Google to expand on the concepts. At it's basis though indexing is pretty easy, it makes a map of items that are used to filter a query, think of them as shortcuts to the rows you are looking for. If there is no index their is no map and therefore the DB has to table spool through each record to find it. Composite indexes are where you have two or more columns that need to be search on, so say you have a WHERE gender = 'M' and age = 18 an composite index builds a map for both columns together. So you may have multipal indexes on your table based on your requirements, you may have a single index on gender to improve a query that gets all males in the system, while you may also have an index on age and gender to aid in querying all males that are 18. Most DB have a index tuning engine, that when turned on will analyze queries that come in and make recommendation as to how to tune the DB. I have not used mySQL in a long time so I don't know if they do, if so it would be worth, turning it on, running through the entirety of your app and collecting the data.<p>If you need further recommendations, just hit me up on Skype, and I can give you a hand in real time, it will be much easier than using HN to help you out.

The difference between nice MVC code and poor MVC code or jQuery soup is the idea that in each method data is only flowing one direction: nowhere are you manually updating both a UI and a data object. Two-way data flows make up the majority of the code in non-MVC jQuery-oriented code. In contrast, a robust model layer with lots of events is the best way to get code reuse and composition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3248552"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3248552</a>",1323362596

It was a risk to start and we knew that, but seeing as it hadn't been done, I can now say that at least I tried.  It cost us so [insert frustrating word] much more to run the company, handle support, produce the product, market, mitigate fraud and deal with people trying to game the system than was worth it to even the charities involvement.

People need to remember the word ""really"" in order to get this right, which is very prone to being forgotten.  Something better like ""honestanswersfor.me"" something like that.<p>2) You will quickly realize that most people ask other people for opinions, not because they want to follow any advice but because they want their feelings validated.  When someone asks their bff ""what do you think about my boyfriend"", they don't want to hear ""I think he's a douchebag"" they want to hear ""he seems really great.""  So this is why answers get rejected.  ""You just don't understand!  When we're together, he's completely different!""  Or even better ""I know you're right, but....""<p>I don't think most people are evolved enough to really care about getting honest feedback and exploring it by forwarding it to others, etc.  There is a small subsection of people that will, but chances are they already know the answer and they don't need the feedback mechanism.<p>There may be some incremental enhancements over Yahoo answers, but neither the core concept nor the enhancements seem very useful.<p>I don't want to just shit on your idea, because I know you probably put a lot of hard work into it, so I want to come up with some other suggestions.  But not trying to be mean or rude, I'm not sure there's enough of an idea here to add suggestions to.<p>Maybe instead of having anonymous answers, why not copy threewords.me and have people give 1 or 2 word answers to respond to the question, and use their real name.  That might be enough for the person to engage in a followup using your enhanced feedback mechanism.<p>For example, if someone asks ""What do you think of my boyfriend?"" and their bff says ""mean"", the one-word answer might have more impact than a huge paragraph filled with flowery language, and that might be enough for the question seeker to follow up with ""what do you mean?  did he do something?"" and it's enough of an icebreaker for people to actually engage in a meaningful conversation.<p>I have no idea if this will actually work or get traction, but it feels like a bit of a different spin than just a Yahoo answers clone.",1323361158

It is somewhat akin to how organisms at the ecosystem level perform a dance of diversification, reproduction, and death in equilibrium with their environs.<p>Cancer is when certain cells in your body become ""greedy"" about their own survival without regard to the survival of the organism as a whole, and begin to literally compete with the rest of the cells in your body for resources.  Normally there are regulatory switches that tell cells to kill themselves when they become damaged beyond the point of repair, but tumor cells have found a way to bypass these safeguards (either because of chance DNA damage at exactly the right sites, genetic susceptibility to malfunction of the safeguards, viral infection, or some combination of the above).

3329621,comment,3328995,3329208,1,0,jasonkolb,,,"I think this is a failing of our educational system at a fundamental level. The way it is currently structured--by treating large groups of students as one whole and then teaching to the average or median student--doesn't work well for anyone except for those students who happen to fall very close to the totally average/median.<p>A much more tailored approach is needed, where students falling behind are helped in their specific problem areas, and gifted/exceptional students are allowed to progress at whatever rate they're capable of. This doesn't need to cost more, either, this is not a matter of setting up an exponential number of schools/classes. Technology can easily do most of this, but a large number of sacred cows would need to die.<p>Ultimately IMO this boils down to the fundamental problem facing our society right now--vested interests controlling the political process to maintain the completely outdated status quo. You see this pretty much everywhere you look.<p>But it always awesome to see gifted kids like this young woman overcome the system to do incredible things. I'm looking forward to seeing what she does next.",1323360813

3329605,comment,3328995,3328995,61,0,polyfractal,,,"This is very cool, but the article is also very light on details.  I have some experience with this competition and the field.<p>Intel ISEF is like the world championship of science fair projects.  Its a <i>very</i> cool competition and a wonderful experience.  I attended the 2003 ISEF in Portland, Oregon for my project on distributed computing.  Hands down the best experience I had in high school.<p><i>However</i>, there is a huge disparity between the projects in medicine/biology and everything else.  I completed my project entirely on my own with no mentors.  Many other CS and engineering projects were similar.  The projects in medicine and biology, however, were conducted at a local university under the guidance of faculty and staff, simply because these experiments are not something you can perform at home.  They also raked in a disproportionate amount of the awards.<p>Having switched to biology in college and now working in a lab post-graduation, I've seen the type of work most undergrads and high-schoolers perform.  Even if they are intellectually committed, much of the work is actually performed by others in the lab.  Undergrads, and especially high-schoolers, often serve as support roles rather than investigators.  Obviously this varies to some degree depending on the lab.<p>My point:  Awesome that this student won, and awesome that this is helping to guide her into biology.  But, I doubt she did most of the work.  Nanoparticle treatment of cancer is not exactly a new idea, so she is likely working under a post-doc who has been working on this for some time.<p>Looking back at my post, this comes across very curmudgeonly.  Perhaps I'm just disappointed that ISEF winners tend to be those helping out professional projects rather than those who design and build the project entirely on their own, or with minimal mentor help.<p>Edit:  to clarify my point, assume a HS student gets out of school at 3pm and work until 5pm, five days a week.  That's a lot for a HS student.  Unfortunately, 10 hours a week isn't going to get anything done in biology.  A single western blot takes longer than 6 hours to run.  Hell, I work 50+ hours/week and progress is still very slow.",1323360555

First off, congrats on quitting and going full-steam ahead on something you're clearly passionate about. That's a huge accomplishment on its own. The ""having no regrets"" part of it is especially important.<p>2. The charity element is a differentiator, but you're going to have to work hard to beat some existing initiatives in the industry (Op4g - www.op4g.com - is the one that comes to mind first). The MR industry has a bit of an ""old boys club"" feel to it, and there is a flood of DIY survey tools coming out each day that make it harder and harder to break through the noise.<p>3. I would spend some time on your site explaining why compelling people to participate through charities is better than direct cash incentives. There is a ton of great research on intrinsic motivation out there that supports this idea, with the book ""Drive"" by Dan Pink being one of the best summaries of why this concept works. However, your potential customers are not going to understand why that works to generate higher quality responses (as evidenced by some of the comments here on HN).<p>4. If you're truly in this for the long-haul, I would try hard to build your own panel of respondents underneath this. That is going to take you a lot of time to do, but it's going to be the only thing that separates you in the long-term from all the other DIY survey tools.

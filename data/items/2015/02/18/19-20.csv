For example, you&#x27;ve been working on a feature branch with a team for a time and now the feature is done and the branch can be merged back into master. However, the history of the feature branch might have been polluted with merge commits. To prevent merging these merge commits back into master, you can rebase the total feature branch on to master. It should be clear to the team that at this point, nobody is to work on that branch anymore and go back to master, or create a new branch (from master).",1424289477

9070591,comment,9069129,9070539,0,0,Aaronontheweb,,,"> Do Actor hierarchies imply a global registration mechanism?<p>No, all registration is done locally underneath the parent actor - i.e. if one parent creates three children, the only place where that state is registered is the parent itself. The root actor on each node can quickly figure out by traversing the tree whether or not a child at a given path exists or not.<p>The only exception to this convention are remote-deployed actors - if ActorSystem A deploys an actor remotely onto ActorSystem B, the RemoteDaemon (a system-level actor) keeps a record of who has actors deployed onto each other. That way if ActorSystem B dies (crash, network goes down, etc...) ActorSystem A can notify all of the local actors who depended on remote-deployed actors that those actors are effectively dead.",1424289431

A modest dose of video games helps me chill out since I am working with the same patterns over and over again and not needing to sort through a lot of stuff.<p>In the book &quot;Have Fun at Work&quot; it says that people can read about 60 pages of technical stuff a day.<p>I have standardized on Java for a programming language.  I&#x27;ve put a huge effort into making peace with Maven,  Spring,  and my IDE.  I have a framework that deals with a lot of the BS when you do command line apps so that I can bang out little apps almost as fast as a Python programmer can.<p>A lot of my getting there has been getting in the habit of reading the same stuff over and over again until I know it like the back of my hand.  For instance I went through a year of hell with Maven and Spring because I was working on systems where whenever somebody had a problem they looked it up on StackOverflow.  Nothing was ever done the same way twice and builds and configuration was a continuous source of frustration.<p>After reading the manuals for those products cover to cover  multiple times I understand them in a holistic way,  I use them right,  and I can understand what is happening when people do strange things.<p>There are certain areas where I am pushing the start of the art and learning a lot and frankly that means I am working on certain things and I think as little as I can about Javascript frameworks and the like.

Typeface, though modern and sans-serif faces pretty much always annoy me.  Large-print books for seniors.  Different styles -- picture, comic, and children&#x27;s books with lots of illustrations.

There has been an effort throughout the years towards greater clarity in writing and speaking; I don&#x27;t think shorter sentences should imply lower reading levels.<p>Here, let me take an easy example: Federalist Paper #12, written in 1787, from my copy of &quot;Charters of Freedom&quot;:<p>> <i>By multiplying the means of gratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise, it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness.</i><p>That&#x27;s beautiful writing. It&#x27;s artful, it&#x27;s poetic. It&#x27;s also dense and aimed squarely at college-educated people. As Samuel Clemens said, &quot;My books are water, those of the great geniuses are wine. Everybody drinks water.&quot;<p>The implication of the priceonomics article is that literacy is declining. I suspect the opposite is actually true -- literacy is at as high a level as it&#x27;s ever been. What&#x27;s declining is <i>florid</i> writing, and where political statements are concerned, that&#x27;s not really undesirable.<p>And the thing is, it&#x27;s not that hard to compile dictionaries by grade level. I did, and I&#x27;m a dumbass. Feel free to rip off the work I&#x27;ve done so far:<p><a href=""http://shomisearch.com/api/vocab/grade/{pre-k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shomisearch.com/api/vocab/grade/{pre-k</a>, k, 1, 2, 3..12, college}<p>or, if you&#x27;d like the data sources included for each word,<p><a href=""http://shomisearch.com/api/vocab/grade+sources/{pre-k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shomisearch.com/api/vocab/grade+sources/{pre-k</a>, k, 1, 2, 3..12, college}<p>I hope someone that&#x27;s better at statistics can take the data and analyze the state of the union addresses with it.

9070361,comment,9062149,9068872,0,0,raggi,,,"Hey Jarkko, been a while, I hope you and the other guys are very well!<p>A few things from my view, not to take away from anything you said, just to drop in some thoughts from my angle:<p>* If I was forced to pick favorites, the most productive SWEs we had were actually in-house. This is no reflection on anyone, and also isn&#x27;t directly related to being in-house. It&#x27;s down to individuals, and most significantly how they communicate around requirements. It&#x27;s a bit more tricky to do this remotely, but you guys also did this very well. I completely agree that you guys were among our top performers; you were absolutely essential to many stages of our growth, and I would hire you all again in a heartbeat. I love you guys, and I miss working with you.<p>* Our eng headcount was actually about 50% larger, the extra gap was more contractors. With so many contracting teams, I gained quite a bit of experience with a wide spread. You guys were great, Wyeworks were also absolutely fantastic. I won&#x27;t mention the others, as they were not so strong, and one contractor in particular did a fair bit of damage as a result of isolated work that was largely overengineered (work that subsequently landed in a book, that&#x27;s still popularized to this day, and is a total anti-pattern that I had to rip out of our code base myself in a mad hurry to fix the critical outages it&#x27;s piss poor performance resulted in). The point is, overall, we had a couple of great contracting teams, you guys included, and a couple of not so good. I don&#x27;t really see much direct correlation with &quot;contractor or not&quot; here, it&#x27;s more about work ethics and processes. The contractors that did worse worked in isolation, the contractors that did better worked in collaboration. The best contractors always kept their cool as they retained the concept of &quot;you&#x27;re a customer&quot;. This advice extends to satellite teams too, where we had one that could have benefited from a more consulting approach to their integration. We all live and learn.<p>* Retention and ownership take a lot of work on all sides. We had a very different relationship with you guys to what we had with Wyeworks. Neither was bad, but Wyeworks was more like a company, and you guys were more like individuals. Of course this is a big product of history, you actually were individuals until after the close, and Wyeworks was obviously bigger than you guys by then too. Both great, both would be hired again in a second. You all demonstrated ownership and stuck with us through good and harder times. Thanks for being awesome! As far as the big G and contractors goes, well, we can&#x27;t open this wound for all to see here, but Wyeworks got through the paperwork and continued with us for a while longer than you guys were able to. This isn&#x27;t a comment about you guys, and as you say, we shouldn&#x27;t bare all here right now, but it&#x27;s just to say that large organizations have complex legal requirements that can be difficult to overcome - this is something that contractors need to understand, and companies relying on them that might be acquired should also take into account - it could affect your valuation in extreme cases. As far as &quot;not a single employee&quot;, you&#x27;re mostly right, maybe you are right, but did you forget our Kiwi friend, our first FTE? he&#x27;s still here, rocking it. I agree with you that the typical churn rate in the valley is all manner of crazy. I have friends who&#x27;ve moved upwards of 4 times in a year. I&#x27;m glad to say that we had far better retention than that.<p>* Code quality. Well, I told a story about this above, so I won&#x27;t repeat it all here, or risk damaging the guilty with more details, but it&#x27;s really important to remember the core point: the gap was in work approach. We got crap code from people who worked in isolation. They were slower, their code was overengineered, underspecified, buggy, and unsustainable - but most critically - largely unnecessary - most of it could be elided with a quick conversation with the PO. It was replaced, and in the case I described above, it was replaced by me, which, given my position was an expensive call. This doesn&#x27;t have anything direct to do with contractors though, it&#x27;s just slightly easier to work in isolation over the wire than it is in person - though we had plenty who did that in person too, with similar but less extreme results. More importantly, it&#x27;s easier to train this stuff out, to help individuals develop their skills and measure their effectiveness when they&#x27;re local. That&#x27;s a long winded way of saying that it is easier to manage your &quot;average&quot; employee in person than it is remotely. Strong employees, like you guys, this is less of an issue. You self manage, give and take feedback, and we all get better together.<p>* knowing what to build. Yep, as you say, this has nothing to do with location. It does have to do with communication, so a contractor needs to be extra effective at communication to make this excellent. Some can, some can&#x27;t - same as any FTE&#x27;s. Again the difference is, as a manager / leader, you can more easily draw people below this line up if they&#x27;re within earshot. A contractor below this line you often end up needing to drop.<p>* H1B and &quot;you&#x27;re not good enough&quot;. I don&#x27;t think we ever uttered such horrific words, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve been said somewhere. The degree requirements for the H1B can be a sticking point, and that impacted a few of our folks over the years. I think these rules are dangerous for the country, especially with the STEM numbers being what they are. Sure you can pile more people into universities here, but what are you going to do about post academic training (which is extremely important, see all the points above none of which are ever taught in a CS/IT degree). We also opened a satellite team as a tactical move to increase headcount without being stuck in the US/valley hiring market, and it was a good move. The team busted the ceiling on their hiring goals, and even though that rapid growth came with the usual growth pains, it was overall a very successful move and many great additions to our team(s). If we&#x27;d have been able to find other strong contractors we may have considered doing that too.<p>I completely agree with your conclusion that it&#x27;s all about who you get. I hope that the above also speaks to this fairly clearly. I&#x27;ve had a wide range of strong and weaker FTE&#x27;s and contractors. I don&#x27;t divide them in that way. There are genuinely other business reasons to prefer one over the other, but a lot of the commonly stated crap isn&#x27;t it - given the right people and the right attitude. As far as expense goes, it&#x27;s all much of a muchness. If a company is that concerned about the cost difference of contractors vs. FTEs they&#x27;re not hiring at the right level and may very well have some management and/or financial problems. From when I&#x27;ve done contract/consulting/WFH work, I&#x27;d avoid such companies.<p>I have recently recommended a bootstrapping company to use some contractors for some of their work, as they&#x27;re situated in the valley and don&#x27;t have the ability to effectively judge incoming talent. They can very effectively get up and running with some contractors, and take their time to find a really strong first local team. I could see them maintaining a mix long term, much like we did, and to great success.<p>I wish you guys all the best, and miss you.<p>disclaimer: I was the first Eng Director, and later CTO at said company.

It also significantly helps reviewing history later, which is done for any number of reasons, including tracking down where bugs were introduced, understanding the reason for a given change, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in projects that always keep a clean history. And I&#x27;ve worked in projects where developers don&#x27;t bother cleaning up history before pushing. And in every non-trivial project that follows the latter I&#x27;ve always hit cases where I try to track down something through the history only to find that the history doesn&#x27;t capture the meaning of the code. This is not just bad merge behavior, but also things like lumping unrelated changes together into a single commit.<p>Even something just as simple as reading recent history to keep up with the changes being made to the codebase is significantly simpler if developers are diligent about keeping a clean history. For example, the Rust project has a lot of activity, but also has a strict code review policy that means that nearly all commits are done with a clean history (very occasionally, long-lived branches are allowed through that have control merges, but those are rare). And as a result, even though I no longer have the time to actively contribute, I&#x27;ve still managed to keep with every non-trivial change made to Rust merely by periodically reading through the history since my last pull. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to do that if the history weren&#x27;t clean.",1424286893

I think this is because relative to previous generations, millenials were raised in a more coddling environment -- participation trophies, grade inflation, etc. I think that this coddling is especially pronounced with regard to high-achieving children/teenagers, who by the time they are in their early 20&#x27;s have a track record of &quot;success&quot; (i.e., straight A&#x27;s, high SATs, got into college of choice, got job of choice), and who have basically been set up to suffer major emotional trauma at their first encounter with anything that significantly diverges from &quot;success&quot; as they have come to understand it.<p>On the non-millenial side, I think that people of a slightly older generation see themselves in a bit of a conundrum, in that they want to get top talent (technical or not) from the top schools, they perceive that &quot;kids these days&quot; are a bit more sensitive and less overtly competitive than they were when they were that age, and get a little bit scared about the possibility of fucking up and putting the hot new developer (who was a &quot;big recruiting win&quot;) in tears. So, they treat the new kid with kid gloves and basically keep their fingers crossed that he/she will be able to do quality work just by figuring things out on his/her own.<p>I actually don&#x27;t think millenials themselves are responsible for any of the above. It&#x27;s the fault of their parents, the general environment fostered by the elitist college-industrial complex that encourages everyone to aspire to a 4-year degree (and which idolizes those who go to the top schools), and subsequently managers who don&#x27;t want to take the risk of actually helping the people under their charge develop professionally and personally.",1424286680

9070329,comment,9069031,9070215,0,0,seiji,,,"<i>but struggle when a lot of inserts and updates need to happen.</i><p>I ran across this with Redis recently.  Redis has an internal data structure called ziplist that&#x27;s a doubly linked list with no pointers.  It just uses byte offsets to the next element, so all elements are in one contiguous block of memory.  It&#x27;s great because you can store a lot of values compactly without needing 1 to 5 pointers (8 to 40 bytes) overhead per element in your data structure.<p>But, a problem shows up when you want to insert or delete items.  Every insert or delete requires expanding or shrinking the entire solid-chunk-of-memory allocation, which isn&#x27;t the fastest thing in the world when your allocation is large.  Also, inserting into the HEAD requires copying the _entire_ ziplist up exactly one element position because the block of your memory layout just changed.<p>So, obviously these things are useful, but their usefulness degrades as your solid blocks of memory hit cache limits.  Everything is super fast when your entire ziplist fits in L1, still about the same in L2, worse in L3, and horrible if your ziplist grows any larger.<p>But, what can we do?  We can fix the entire problem by creating a traditional linked lists of solid memory block ziplists.  Now, each ziplist can remain small (8 KB to 16 KB), and when we grow bigger, we just cut a new ziplist, pointer-attach it to the previous ziplist, and now we have a minimal-pointer, high-locality data structure with unlimited growth potential without performance defects.  It doesn&#x27;t buckle under inserting or updating arbitrary elements since each memory block is isolated to a maximum ~8 KB size (reminder: your L1 cache is 32 KB to 64 KB depending on architecture) and now your memory usage due to pointer overhead is now also _greatly_ reduced (assuming your data was small and dominated or matched by pointer overhead size in the first place).<p>As a double bonus, now when your data structure is a solid block of memory, you can compress individual contiguous memory blocks (usually with great compression ratios) because your contents will tend to be homogeneous in shape inside the same container.  Result: huge reduction in pointer overhead + sequential access + compression = best of all possible worlds.<p>Other details/comparisons at <a href=""https://matt.sh/redis-quicklist-visions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://matt.sh/redis-quicklist-visions</a>",1424286504

9070296,comment,9068656,9070116,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> The Nemesis Hypothesis hasn&#x27;t been debunked.<p>I rather thought that Nemesis had become a fairly untenable hypothesis in light of the the facts that:\n(1) Insofar as there is a periodicity to extinctions to explain (what Nemesis was posited to explain), more recent analysis has shown that it is <i>too</i> consistent for any plausible orbit for Nemesis, and \n(2) A sensitive enough survey to detect stars (including brown dwarfs) within the radius of Earth in which Nemesis would have to exist has been conducted and failed to detect any such star.",1424286050

9070294,comment,9067800,9069793,0,0,thejaredhooper,,,"I agree. It would be nice to drill down into the data in order to further analyze everything. I also feel there was a particular sort of censorship in the dataset, an indicator of which was the explicit racist and misogynistic words that were absent. There was a large lack of swears and bad terms in this analysis (bitch being a particularly obvious cut) and I, for one, see examples of these slurs prevalently used by young men far too often on the site.<p>Perhaps the data was tailored when it was provided to the analyst, or it was censored after reception, but this felt too &quot;PG-13&quot; for an analysis of reddit&#x27;s &quot;interests&quot;.",1424286042

This shifts the control outside your hands. Remember when there&#x27;s a story about how you can&#x27;t remove data from a service provider ? It doesn&#x27;t matter if Google/Twitter/Facebook/others support removing my data and public posts, it means that I have to hunt down other parties to do the same, as they don&#x27;t update their data and no one knows that app review I wrote is 3 years old and the account doesn&#x27;t even exist anymore.<p>That&#x27;s also why I&#x27;m done with the Internet and real name policies.",1424286040

Probably a lot of those people do in fact use interesting little hacks, configure their software in an unusual way or have a nice looking workspace. But there isn't even a photo of the workspace attached to the article or a bunch of screenshots while people are doing some work. A vidcast or screencast would perhaps be a better medium than an article for doing this, like in the recent ""play by play"" peepcode screencasts (not an advertisement, they're better, but I didn't found them worth the price so far).",1304405987

When I first heard of it, I thought the same thing - this is going to go nowhere. Then a few months later I recall seeing them make a post on HN about their growth, which was pretty good at the time. I remember thinking, even then, a second time that they were going to go nowhere. That was probably half a year ago and I haven't heard a single thing about the site until now. I've never once heard it mentioned in person, via my friends or on campus. I'm in Texas, which apparently has a large user-base for the site ... still, never heard this site mentioned by friends. I don't know what they're doing or if the site is any good, but I feel like they're the sleeping giant type of website. Like, they're just going to come out of nowhere and post some usage stats about their millions of college student users or something.",1304405597

Actually we have an office, i have to commute to everyday but i love it far more than working on my own. I am achored to the office yeah, but its the place where i can get most done and talk to other engineers working on the same project.\nIts not that having a Desktop disqualifies you from having a laptop aswell, so if i feel like it, i could still work from somewhere else. I like to have the best gear for every situation, so in the office having a workstation with 2x 24"" screens and a MBA for on the road seems to be perfect for me. Dropbox makes syncing relativly painless.<p>Oh yeah the brain argument ;) Well people tend to work on different stuff. I am a game developer and apart from a huge IDE i also need to compile builds, test server & client on the same machine, view debugging/docs while running the builds etc. With only the Laptop screen its a major pita.

You have an image; it is projected onto a grid; some values were not sampled and are unknown.  Fill them with NaNs.  Then run whatever operations you wish on the image (scaling, convolution, morphological operations).  The NaNs will propagate through to the result image and indicate unknown values in exactly the correct way, without having to do extra work.<p>For example, a convolution will widen a single NaN to take in the whole footprint of the convolution kernel.  A scaling will just pass the NaN through to one pixel in the output.<p>There is no analog of this property of the NaN for integers.",1304405368

We effectively competed with each other to see who could do what better.<p>We also went overboard with the assignments a bit - we'd take the basic assignment and ""add features"" to out-do each other. Often we'd have to hand in a ""normal"" solution though for marking - the marker didn't appreciate a 20 page printout for a problem that should be half a page of code.<p>And of course there was also some time taken to help others - to effectively give them ""extra assignments"" to get their code up to scratch.<p>We had access to equipment which we certainly couldn't afford ourselves (although it's laughingly primitive by today's standards) so there was never any shortage of creative ideas.<p>To make things a little more interesting we also signed up for other classes in the science faculty outside of ""only"" computer science.

318137,comment,317155,317445,0,0,jmatt,,,"Excellent point.<p>Never. Neither does In-N-Out, another privately owned ""openly"" christian company.<p>Staying private is one good way to alleviate issues with upset share holders and continuing to passively support the owners beliefs. This is fine as long as the company still respects the rights of the share holders, customers and employees.<p>As many have already stated, and i'll reiterate. There are two issues being discussed here. 1) gay rights. [no question they should have equal rights] 2) entangling support for social issues with a public company [this is where people have problems].<p>All the publicly held multi-national companies that I know of offer benefits to a homosexual partner. But they do it through the normal workflow of HR. The problem is Google does everything differently. Including making this announcement. So the question remains is this an acceptable way to do it? Google thinks so. (now my libertarian free market tendancies come in to play) If you support the way they did it, buy some more Google and give them a positive blog article. If you disagree sell it or short it and go use duckduckgo or yahoo.",1222667080

318128,comment,317778,318023,0,0,indiejade,,,"Some would have a ""Firefox3"" option in their respective repository or package manager which makes the update very very easy (APT/YUM/RPM).  These allow you to check the box and press ""update"".  PCLinuxOS does this, for this specific upgrade, if I remember correctly (Firefox2 -> 3).  Others that require a little more work let you just download the tar.bz2 file, decompress via command-line it in the appropriate directory.  But sometimes it takes a bit of reading the documentation to understand how to get the symbolic links and such launching the correct instance of the browser.<p>Actually, I don't know if I should be attempting to answer your question when I'm so tired.

318123,comment,317778,318023,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"The short answer is that packages don't work across distros. Or perhaps I could say they shouldn't be expected to work across distros.<p>The longer answer is that in situations where one distro has descended from another (probably the most well know example being Ubuntu descending from Debian) it is possible to use an Ubuntu package on Debian or vice versa, I've done it. But you should have a really good reason to do this and have done your homework (I can only think of one occasion where I did have a good enough reason to do this, and it didn't last long). This is possible (though not recommended) because all the distros that descend from Debian use the package management system derived from Debian also, which is incidentally the best one, IMO.<p>If you wish to know more about what makes it the best and the policy that guides how packages move through the different Debian releases (Experimental, Unstable, Testing and Stable), check out this link:<p><a href=""http://newpeople.debian.org/~srivasta/talks/why_debian/talk.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newpeople.debian.org/~srivasta/talks/why_debian/talk....</a><p>Particularly, you could read the section titled ""Quality of implementation"".<p>I assume something similar would apply to Red Hat and all the distros that descend from it for example... Their package management policy just doesn't work as well is all. :)",1222665275

1.  MEPIS
2.  PCLinuxOS

4.  Linux Mint
5.  Fedora
6.  Debian (would be higher on the list, but for that annoying ""Iceweasel"" thing)

9.  Gentoo
10. Sabayon<p>Though the list changes often.<p>RE the discussion about having lots of choices . . . yes for some it can be overwhelming, but not everyone is an  idiot.  That whole notion needs to evaporate already, especially as that generation which has essentially ""grown up"" with lots of technology, innovation, gadgets and more enters the workforce in full.  Of course there are still idiots, but not with as great frequency as less-technical generations past.<p>When attempting to explain my software obsession / obsession for choice in OSS / to fellow females who aren't hardcore techs, I like to make an analogy to shopping for clothes, which most females relate to well.   Some females like to populate a closet full of fancy clothes; I like to fill my website -- <a href=""http://oss.zentu.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oss.zentu.net</a> -- have my computers be full of interesting software.<p>Or something like that.

318113,comment,317778,317912,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"You're right that there is a lot of choice. But most people who like to use Linux actually see this as a big plus. That may be hard to understand for people who only use Windows. Not that there's anything wrong with using Windows, it's just a different paradigm.<p>When first wanting to get into Linux, the best option is to talk to someone that you trust not just to be a fan boy for their favorite distro, but to tell you honestly which they think would be best for you after you having told them (also honestly) where your computing experience sits on the scale from novice to expert and also what you intend to do with the distro you eventually choose.<p>These days, for a novice user wishing to experiment with Linux in general, I think the choice is pretty clear. Ubuntu.<p>Your last sentence seems to imply something along the lines of that MS should feel more secure that Linux as a whole is diluted into numerous distros which assumedly makes it harder for novices to get into Linux. Ergo, Linux is not as much of a threat to Windows' dominance of the market. I think this is missing one point that often comes up at least in the Debian community and this is that Debian has never really had the goal of dethroning Windows and taking on it's mantle as the ""dominant"" OS or anything like that. Debian doesn't care. The project has different goals to this. Debian is just doing its thing, and if that thing happens to work for you, then great. If not, then try something else.<p>Maybe Ubuntu does have this goal to dethrone Windows or whatever, and if so, more power to them. But my point is don't assume that all Linux distros even care how popular they are, or care about competing with any other OS, because many don't.",1222664407

8915408,comment,8914467,8914467,0,0,mturmon,,,"The concept of gentrification is typically used in a sloppy and unhelpful way.  It is used as a slur, as if gentrification is prima facie bad.  But reuse of urban contexts, turnover of neighborhoods, is a fact of life.  Cities outlive people and industries.<p>The legitimate grievance, I think, is where public money is used to subsidize neighborhood transformation.  (As was done in SoHo with forgiveness of back debt on properties and other give-aways.)  This tends to be highly non-democratic, a process in which wealth is concentrated in the hands of well-connected land developers.<p>The article touches on this briefly, but to me this is the key problem.  Everything else is just people on the sidelines grouching about how others got lucky by buying in to SoHo (or wherever) early on.  Reductively put, just sour grapes.",1421726286

I similarly hate that everything is getting intertwined so much that it is hard to actually pick and choose applications without taking a huge amount of cruft with it.<p>Having said that, if you look at the list of people working on Wayland it is quite impressive.  As it contains a good number of core X windows developers, you would be hard pressed to argue that they don&#x27;t understand the trade-offs that they are introducing.  And while I haven&#x27;t had time to play with it in any real depth, I&#x27;ve looked at Mutter&#x27;s API and it is quite nice.  Finally, I&#x27;ve actually tried Wayland (with Gnome and on top of Mutter by itself) and while there were still some problems at the time (about 3 months ago), I was actually able to get a full day&#x27;s work done without much complaint.  In fact, it is snappy and responsive and it mostly works.<p>I like exporting my X displays through ssh, so I really don&#x27;t know if I will use Wayland seriously any time soon, but I think it is a good prospect for people who aren&#x27;t me.  I like the fact that this update from the Gnome guys shows that they are thinking, &quot;Hey maybe not everybody will dump X.  Let&#x27;s try to find a place where we can showcase Wayland with the least inconvenience to conservative people&quot;.<p>IMHO, this kind of development is nothing but good.  The real question is if Red Hat will take a less heavy hand in deployment of this as opposed to other &quot;Let&#x27;s reinvent the world&quot; projects.  As an option, I&#x27;m extremely happy to have it.  If it gets wrapped up in everything so that I can&#x27;t use any popular software without it, then I will be unhappy.  But so far I see no signs of that.",1421725838

It is barely a drop in the ocean.<p>It is, although the comments aren&#x27;t HN readers talking about themselves—the comments are HN readers talking about what comic book readership in their country looks like.  To pick a random example, see <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8898345"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8898345</a>.  Pay attention to what the author is saying: not &quot;I read X&quot;, but &quot;the best selling comic in Norway for decades was Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;The best selling French-language comic is usually Spirou&quot;.<p>> You have to realize that this is afterall a business - the fact that there are very few comics that do portray what you&#x27;re talking about disagrees with your &quot;tremendous evidence&quot;.<p>The fact that there are very few comics <i>in the US</i>.  There are very many such comic books outside of the US, <i>and they sell well</i>.  My point is, the way the US comic book market looks is not inevitable; instead it&#x27;s a result of many years of poor decisions by the US comic book publishers to appeal to a single niche.<p>Or to turn your phrase back on you: it&#x27;s a business for comic producers all over the world.  However, elsewhere they have found success selling to audiences that US comic book producers have long neglected.  I know given how popular US cultural products are, it&#x27;s easy to assume that things outside the US look just like things inside the US, but that&#x27;s not always the case.

Connecting directly through satellite is certainly possible if more people were interested in it. Our satellite networks are still fairly basic primarily because there&#x27;s not been a historical abundance of interest in the technology due to its limitations compared to terrestrial networking.<p>ViaSat-1 is (as far as I&#x27;m aware) the most capable satellite currently in orbit, with a rate of 140 Gbit/s. Its bandwidth capacity  when launched larger than all of the other North American satellites combined.<p>I would be VERY surprised to learn that the fundamental issue with this would be spectrum capacity, as the K band satellites operate in is very wide.<p>The way current satellite technologies typically deal with concurrent data streams is to split up into &#x27;beams&#x27; that cover a specific region. Currently VS1 uses 72 bands but they&#x27;re spread all over Canada and the US. With more satellites and tighter beam placement it&#x27;s certainly feasible to have millions of simultaneous connections.<p>I feel like I kind of rambled on there - if there&#x27;s anything in particular you&#x27;d like me to expand upon I&#x27;d be happy to (and if someone notices I&#x27;m wrong about anything please let me know!).",1421725616

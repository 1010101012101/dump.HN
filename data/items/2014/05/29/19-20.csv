At this point the victim can no longer drop the charges. The only person who can drop the case then is the prosecuting lawyer.

First there&#x27;s quality-control: the #1 thing that&#x27;s going to wreck your relationship with a laundry customer is if you mess up their clothes, and if all the clothes-handling is outsourced, how much can you do to prevent that from happening?<p>And second, if all the value you bring to the table is a thin layer of code over someone else&#x27;s service, at some point that someone else will just write their own app and cut out the middleman. &quot;Climbing the value chain,&quot; the MBAs call it -- start off as a provider of outsourced services to companies whose executives&#x27; noses are too high in the air to do their dirty work themselves anymore, and then slowly shoulder those companies out of the way by establishing direct relationships with their customers at a lower cost.

The main difference seems to be that they&#x27;ve added hooks [3] into the pipeline, and they duck punch the core API to intercept errors.

7818116,comment,7817425,7817843,1,0,pdabbadabba,,,"Let me first take issue with two things:<p>1. I don&#x27;t think that I or anyone else in this thread have to &quot;prove&quot; that the FT piece was shoddy in order to express that opinion. That said, I do agree that some support is needed.<p>2. I don&#x27;t know that FT&#x27;s data were shoddy, exactly, but Piketty&#x27;s response certainly suggests that their review was less than thorough and their claims overblown.<p>That out of the way, Piketty points out a number of things about the FT analysis that, if true, would indeed suggest that the FT analysis was not very good. It is possible that Piketty&#x27;s statements aren&#x27;t true -- I&#x27;m not an economist, I&#x27;m only part of the way through Piketty&#x27;s book, and I have not looked at the technical papers and datasets exhaustively (though I have looked at them) -- but it all sounds plausible to me, and it is all easily verifiable.<p>For those who do not want to wade through everything, the basic theme is this: at, it seems, every turn, FT notices an anomaly in Piketty&#x27;s data and assumes that it reflects an error when, in fact, the anomalies are reflections of conscious methodological choices. FT then makes a big deal out of every &quot;error&quot; even though only one or two of them would make a meaningful difference, even if FT were correct in identifying them. More seriously, in most of these cases, FT could well have answered its own concerns by reviewing the copious technical notes that Piketty has made public. But, it would seem, FT either could not be bothered to consult them, or did consult them but chose not to disclose these explanations to its readers. FT then generates its own results based on its dubious &quot;corrections&quot; of Piketty&#x27;s &quot;errors&quot; and does not bother to sanity check them.  It fails to notice, e.g., that its analysis shows that Britain is more egalitarian than Sweden (hard to believe) and, moreover, that it is one of the most egalitarian societies in the history of the world (even harder to believe). It&#x27;s not impossible, of course, that Britain actually is that equal, but a responsible researcher, one would expect, would have noticed that feature in its results and made an effort to come to grips with it. FT&#x27;s failure to approach its own results with that sort of critical eye (the eye with which it read Piketty&#x27;s results) to me suggests sloppiness or bias.<p>Some quotes:<p><i>...I compute decennial averages on the basis of the closest years available. This is clearly explained in the chapter 10 excel file (see sheet &quot;TS10.1&quot;). For instance, &quot;1870&quot; is computed as the average for years &quot;1873-1877&quot;, &quot;1910&quot; as the average &quot;1907-1908&quot;, and so on. These choices can be discussed and improved, but they are reasonably transparent (</i>they are explicitly mentioned in the excel table, which apparently the FT did not notice<i>), and as one can check they have negligible impact on long run evolutions. </i><p><i>The FT also suggests that I made a transcription error by using the estimate for 1908 for the top 1% wealth share (namely, 53.8% of total wealth) for year 1920 (instead of the correct raw estimate for that year, namely 51.5% of total wealth)... In any case, whatever adjustment one chooses to make to deal with this break in series is again going to have a negligible impact on long-run patterns.</i><p><i>The FT argues however that no explanation is given for some of the data construction....This is a surprising statement, because all necessary explanations are actually given in the technical research paper on which these series are based.</i><p><i>What it find somewhat puzzling in this controversy is the following: (i) the FT journalists evidently did not read carefully the technical research papers and excel files that I have put on-line; (ii) whatever adjustment one makes to correct for differential mortality (and I certainly agree that there are uncertainties left regarding this complex and important issue), it should be clear to everyone that this really has a relatively small impact on the long-run trends in wealth inequality. This looks a little bit like criticism for the sake of criticism.</i><p><i>What is troubling about the FT methodological choices is that they use the estimates based upon estate tax statistics for the older decades (until the 1980s), and then they shift to the survey based estimates for the more recent period. This is problematic because we know that in every country wealth surveys tend to underestimate top wealth shares as compared to estimates based upon administrative fiscal data. Therefore such a methodological choice is bound to bias the results in the direction of declining inequality.</i><p><i>Also note that a 44% wealth share for the top 10% (and a 12.5% wealth share for the top 1%, according to the FT) would mean that Britain is currently one the most egalitarian countries in history in terms of wealth distribution; in particular this would mean that Britain is a lot more equal that Sweden, and in fact a lot more equal than what Sweden as ever been (including in the 1980s). This does not look particularly plausible.</i>",1401391800

Such warnings become part of their criminal record in the UK and effect things like employment, as they are in effect a criminal conviction (as I understand it, although the UK describes them as &quot;not a criminal conviction but an admission of guilt [after being accused by the police]&quot;, which I view as an irrelevant distinction). There is no such system under federal law in the United States. A UK reader might rationally assume &quot;police cautions&quot; are just called &quot;police warnings&quot; or &quot;US law enforcement warnings&quot; in the US. Police cautions are not something most people in the US know about, and would probably be outraged to know of their existence.

Ok, here&#x27;s a possible guess on what might have happened.<p>You wanted to build an app for the idea you have. For gyms. From your personality and app, I&#x27;m guessing you like working out. You needed someone with some technical ability. Maybe you recruited this cofounder or he was a friend of a friend? Maybe a close friend? You made a deal with him because you couldn&#x27;t pay him, but &quot;generous equity&quot; in the company. He stayed at your house etc, because he wasn&#x27;t getting paid in real money while you guys were building the app. I have a hunch you had a lot more business experience and money in the bank. Then it sounds like its likely a combination of him being a bit over his head and realizing that he wasn&#x27;t a real cofounder and was just an employee. Then you decide to fire him and he says, &quot;Hey wait, I&#x27;ve been working for free all this time!&quot;. Then the legal bit ensues and you have to &quot;pay him&quot; for his portion of the company that he likely said was for his work.<p>Did I get close?<p>And your comments about the lawyer are definitely not the kind of thing I would do publicly about a friend and definitely gives me insight into your character in general.

From a tech cofounder, some tips for next time:<p>Structure the work so that there is frequent, visible progress. At my last startup, the work was broken down into lumps that were at most a few days in size. Modest, regular accomplishment makes progress transparent to you, and smooths out the emotional roller coaster for you cofounder.<p>Be present. My last cofounder and I spent most of our time within easy speaking distance. Later, as we hired more engineers, we kept him close to all the engineers. Whenever we had a product question, we just had to turn our heads to ask. The easier you make communication, the more you&#x27;ll get.<p>When there are issues, explicitly bring up both process and emotion as needed. The reason I became a developer was that it let me hide away in my parents&#x27; basement and not talk to people. That was great for coding skills, but not so great for knowing how to work with others or to understand my emotions. E.g., in this case you might have said, &quot;Hey, I know that getting funding is really putting pressure on us. Honestly, it scares the hell out of me sometimes. So let&#x27;s break the next few months work down into micro-deliverables. That way you&#x27;ll always have something clear to work on, and I don&#x27;t have to worry that things aren&#x27;t making progress.&quot;<p>Depending on circumstance, it can also be worth bringing in a business coach or therapist to help sort out these things.",1401390362

Despite the &quot;security concerns&quot; expressed in the TrueCrypt page, <i>which were clearly a joke</i>, there&#x27;s no reason to think TrueCrypt has any significant vulnerabilities at this time, and the second phase of the audit will take place as scheduled. The last time TrueCrypt was updated was <i>two years ago</i> - it&#x27;s stable software that doesn&#x27;t need constant tweaking, so the developers bowing out is not a problem.<p>Chances are, someone will either fork TrueCrypt (version 3.1 of the TrueCrypt license seems to make this a legitimate possiblity) or create a replacement, possibly using the same container format. TrueCrypt is pretty much <i>just as good</i> as it was before this happened. Give it a couple of months before you start switching over to some other solution (which is likely to be less &quot;battle-hardened&quot; than the incredibly popular TrueCrypt anyway, and thus somewhat more likely to be insecure). There&#x27;s no rush.",1401390206

What I&#x27;ve been shocked by in the past is the disparity between youtube on my comcast connection and youtube on people&#x27;s TimeWarner connection when I&#x27;ve visited, where it has been completely abysmal in the past. Like, 1990s RealPlayer quality, not only because you have to turn it down to 144p just to play, but also because it still stutters horribly even at that resolution.<p>I feel like most of the &quot;one weird DNS trick to fix youtube&quot; posts have been about timewarner, though I don&#x27;t know if my memory is accurate there.<p>Notably TimeWarner looks fine on these graphs (at least in a few places where I&#x27;ve had friends complain about it in the past), so maybe they&#x27;ve fixed things.",1401390135

Everyone else in the business is, more or less (meaning many authors write as an avocation, while very few people would consider doing extend work of a tedious nature like editing for no money).<p>With the rise of ebooks they are also subject to the wildly counter intuitive aspects of markets for digital goods. High fixed costs with near zero marginal cost, leading to a fat head, long tail market structure.<p>Authors such as Stross who are commercially successful are in a highly elite group, so I tend to discount their concerns as being generalizable as a societal concern.

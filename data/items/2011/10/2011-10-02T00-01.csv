3061674,comment,3061439,3061439,21,0,ctide,,,"I got as far as: <i>Oh, and good luck mocking your database and HTTP request objects.</i> and just stopped.  If you don't have any experience with TDD, then don't write about it.  Mocking HTTP request objects is incredibly trivial and tools are written in every language to do just that.<p>I don't know why these articles keep getting written.  No one's forcing you to write your tests first, and if you can't wrap your head around the benefits (which the author clearly can't) then don't do it.  It's fine.  I'll still continue to utilize TDD, and continue to pump out significantly more code (with significantly less bugs) than the code I produced without TDD.  Yes, there's definitely code I write where I don't write the tests first.  It happens, sometimes it's just easier to bang something out because you aren't sure what you're building.  That doesn't mean TDD is a failure, it's a tool, like anything else.  Use it where it's appropriate, because the benefits are massive.",1317517038

3061665,comment,3061439,3061626,2,0,gambler,,,"Depending on the language you're using, there might be some tools to help you.<p>For example, MS recently released a library for Design by Contract (aka Contract Programming) in .NET 4.0. It allows you to specify constraints on your methods, such as things you expect to be true before the method is called, after, and between <i>all</i> method calls in a class.  The library is capable of static verification, but it's partly an experimental feature and you need to pay for expensive version of VS. (Runtime checking is available for free.)<p>But, here is the cool part: MS also released an automatic test generator called PEX. It can do exactly what you've described - go into your code and automatically find edge cases, and generate tests that cover each of them. And it's free.<p>So, you can write contracts, run PEX, and if something goes wrong, you will see which inputs generated exceptions.<p>D also has DbC functionality. I don't think it runs any static verification on it yet, but you can use it to detect abnormalities during functional testing.",1317516749

I'm writing an application that's largely wiring, and for the first time in a long time, using TDD.  It's refreshing.<p>Most of my tests are two-liners, like:<p><pre><code>    it ""should do x when y"" do\n        obj_under_test.should_receive(:consequence_method).with(some_args)\n        obj_under_test.do_something\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThere are a number of reasons why this has helped:<p>1. It ensures I'm using dependency injection, etc to write testable, well-factored code.  There's huge correlation between testability and maintainability.\n2. I don't have to boot the thing all the time to confirm that I didn't mess up in some obvious way.  Covering the code paths prevents typos.\n3. My test suite runs in under three seconds.  I can sanity check what I'm doing, without being tempted to browse HN/reddit/twitter/etc.<p>I like TDD <i>more</i> in wiring-only code.  If I'm writing wiring, I know what my test case will look like ahead of time, and I'll write it first.  If I'm writing experimental algorithms, I have no idea what will happen, and I'd rather write code and poke it.",1317516156

Being walking distance to a grocery store is not the same thing as living in a transit-oriented region and living your entire life without dependence on a car. Suburbs were born from industry, not out of the realization of American's idealized community.<p>I live in downtown Portland, OR and have done so for the last eight years without ever owning a car. I can walk or bike to literally everything in the city, or alternatively take a streetcar, light rail train, or technologically advanced bus system. There's a reason people move here – there's value in Urban Growth Boundaries (UGBs) that make more livable, walkable, awesome places to live your life.<p>And because of the UGB, it's even faster to escape the city's limits and find yourself in <i>real</i> green space. On Tuesday after work, I drove 45 minutes (using a car-sharing program) out of the city to a national wilderness where I slept under the stars, caught a few trout, and still made it back into the city for work the next morning.

3061595,comment,3060215,3060328,7,0,jrockway,,,"Came here to post this.  The key thing to know about git is to always, always, always commit your changes before doing anything that affects history.  This is not for data loss reasons, it's for being able to document what is happening; when you have a bunch of unsaved work, you don't know what's there and git doesn't know what's there.  Therefore, it's very easy to get yourself into a state where you don't ""care"" about your working copy, and that's when you can do something where you lose work.  If you commit before you do any merging or pulling every single operation that you perform afterwards can be reverted cleanly.  And, you'll have a human readable note that documents what you were thinking at the time.<p>If you don't put your work into git, it can't track it for you.  You can always uncommit if you don't like what you committed.  In fact, you should consider your local history to be a work in progress; just like you're editing your source code to keep it clean, you should be editing your history to keep it clean.  Git never deletes history, so even if you edit it, you can always get back to where you were.  What you call ""master"" may have changed, but what was master before your rebase still exists, in its entirety, inside of git.  (It's simply called HEAD@{0} instead of master.  See ""git reflog"".)",1317514959

I thought domestic production and sale are OK.<p>[edit: Also wanted to add this. One of the coolest food experiences I've had was when visiting a friend in rural Sicily. Apparently the traditional method of making ricotta is largely illegal due to sanitary reasons (pasteurization, not simply doing it in the shed behind your house, etc). However one morning we got up around 4am and met some friends of his Dad. Spent a few hours learning how they made traditional ricotta and got to eat some fresh from the pot before they took the rest to sell to the locals. When it's boiling-hot and fresh from the pot, it's a totally different (and better) cheese than anything I've ever seen in the store.]",1317514105

3061542,comment,3061083,3061429,16,0,patio11,,,"The delta between this deal and every other deal ever is not ""Employees are uniquely getting screwed.""  Employees always get diluted.  Three things you can count on: death, taxes, and employees getting diluted.  You've got to come up with a fairly elaborate scenario to make this particular marginal dilution sound morally significant for me, since it is likely to be on the order of ""We stopped stocking one particular brand of free soda"" for most employees, since employees start out with wee little stakes and always get them progressively diluted over time anyway <i>regardless</i> of this micro-controversy.<p>The delta between this deal and every other deal is that the founders are getting treated in a way typical for VCs, not in the way typical for employees.<p>Here's some numbers about a hypothetical company FooCorp to make a point: assume that the employee option pool is 20% of the pre-market valuation of FooCorp when FooCorp raises $1 million on a $5 million valuation.  (That pre-market bit is significant because putting it pre-market rather than post-market is a easy way for VCs to change the price of the deal without changing the price of the deal, which is a theme we will be returning to shortly.)  Prior to the first round, employees (present and future) own or will eventually own 20% of the company, and the founders own or will eventually own 80% of the company.  (We'll pretend there are no angels to keep the math easy.)<p>After the first round, employees own 16% of the company.  Wait, didn't we say 20% literally on the piece of paper we signed the deal on?  Yes, but some 20%s are better than others, for example 20%s which are written by people who do this for a living.  This is garden-variety VC screwage and only tangentially related to the point.<p>Anyhow, say we raise $3 million on a $15 post for Series B.  Employees get diluted again, with the founders, and they now own 12.8%.<p>We'll stipulate that the company goes red hot and the numbers around Series C are getting thrown about in the neighborhood of a billion dollars.  They want to raise $80 million for business use.  If the founders negotiate a post-money valuation of a billion, the employees get diluted to about 11.8%.  If the founders instead raise $100 million and return $20 million of it to themselves, the employees are instead diluted to about 11.5%.<p><i>But wait</i>.  That is <i>exactly equivalent to</i> the founders raising $80 million (i.e. taking no money) but just not negotiating quite as well: if the VCs wheedle them down to $800 post, then employees end up with 11.5% anyhow.  (That's a perfectly reasonable outcome for the negotiation because valuations for non-public companies are set by slicing opening a goat's entrails and successfully arguing that they look more or less auspicious than the other guy thinks while insinuating that if he doesn't like it he can go cut a different goat with other people.)<p>This (the OP) is a discussion about the price of the deal (and, secondarily, about the diminished leverage a hypothetical VC would have for subsequent deals if he had  to deal with a counterparty who was already rich).  It just doesn't sound like one, because we have invented a rich vocabulary under which people who understand money can manipulate the price paid to people who understand computers without ever saying the word ""price.""<p>Returning back to tangible reality of possible interest to HN readers, an early engineer promised .5% of the company when he joined waaaay back before they were famous is looking at this discussion and going ""Honestly, guys, why do you care?"", because the differential is between him ending up with 0.295% of the company (that's 2.95 million per billion if they should take no money and then exit) and 0.2875% of the company (that's 2.875 million per billion if they should take no money and exit).  i.e. In the still-quite-unlikely event that he receives a pot of gold at the end of his rainbow, it is not a meaningfully different pot of gold than he would have otherwise gotten.",1317513932

Mozilla and google talked a lot about various proposals around ""identity"" being managed in the browser rather than via websites starting about a year ago.<p>Mozilla's BrowserID focused more on a really good way of managing a single identity (per Firefox profile), whereas Chrome's MultiProfiles were focused on easily switching between multiple profiles with separate cookies, history, passwords, etc (whether that's for multiple people or a single person with multiple but separate needs online).<p>Multi-profiles seem good for your need...you can stay signed in with a persistent google cookie in one window (maybe just keeping gmail open), while doing all your regular surfing without the cookie in another window, under a different profile.<p>Both are still in development though. I don't see multi-profiles in about:flags in chrome, and some poking around shows you might need to run chrome with a command flag, which is a pain. Reviewers seem to like it, though.<p>edit: it's not a nice integrated browser function, but I guess you could get equivalent functionality by just running different Firefox instances with different profiles.

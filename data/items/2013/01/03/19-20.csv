How much data did you collect? How big was the difference you observed?<p>Javascript is less reliable than server-side tracking. There are lots of issues. Some people have Javascript turned off, though normally this is a small proportion. If people navigate away before the testing harness is loaded you can lose data. If you're testing elements that navigate away from the current page you can lose data if the harness is not implemented correctly (the browser will cancel pending requests when you navigate away).<p>I can't say what went wrong in your case but there is the potential for lots to go wrong.",1357243125

The current opening is for a software engineer with a broad range of talents.<p>For example we're currently working on mobile applications (Android), embedded computing (Arduino, chipKIT, PIC32, ARM Cortex M3), web applications (Flask, Django), the CAN bus, NFC and other networking research. We also do a lot of physical prototyping of electronics and housings - we're talking PCB design, 3D printing and the like.<p>The best candidates are those with a few years of experience in a professional environment or new grads with lots of cool projects under their belt. We love open source and are pushing the company in new and more open directions.<p>Don't let the big corporation name scare you away - the research team operates with much of the freedom to experiment of a smaller company, but with the benefits of large corporate backing (eg. if you need it to get your job done, we can buy it).",1357243094

The same is true in every other country I can think of -- at least in the US the fact remains that if you're genuinely innocent you can have your day in court. If anything characters like Conrad Black get away with -- figuratively -- murder.<p>The question is -- do we have someone more sympathetic than a guy who looted his own companies and a serial killer to serve as an example of this kind of thing being done to genuinely innocent victims? Forbes may regard Conrad Black as a sympathetic victim, but I don't think most reasonable people would. What the writer of this article doesn't like is that the Federal government will do some very nasty things -- in court -- to people it knows are guilty but hard to convict of their actual crimes.<p>In most other countries if the government hates you that much you'll have much worse to worry about.",1357243082

5004274,comment,5003980,5004206,4,0,siddharthdeswal,,,"There's a very simple reason for that.<p>You're seeing a difference between Control and Variation in an A/A test is because a very small number of visitors have been tested. To explain, suppose you toss a coin 10 times and 7 out of those it shows heads. Just based on these 10 tosses, would you conclude that the coin is loaded? Probably not. Suppose you tossed the coin a 100 times, it'll probably show heads maybe 43 or 47 or 51 or 52 times.<p>Point being, as you toss it more and more, the number of times it shows a heads or tails comes closer and closer to 50% but you need to toss it a large number of times to be fairly certain that it isn't loaded. The more you toss it, the more certain you are. However, you'll only be more and more certain, but never completely certain. VWO works on a similar principle. The more number of times you toss up Control and Variation to visitors, the more certain you become of either being better, worse or equal to each other.<p>If you'll read the post, the graph shows the fluctuations in the beginning, after which things kind of settle down. In an A/A test, they'll settle down to a very similar conversion rate.<p>Here's an article from the VWO Knowledgebase that'll help you with running an A/B test correctly <a href=""http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/knowledge/how-to-ideally-run-an-ab-split-test/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/knowledge/how-to-ideally-r...</a>",1357243019

One of the reasons I liked the iRex Illiad e-reader was that the screen was large enough and had enough resolution that one could display a PDF and read it at its nominal 'size'.<p>What surprises me about this conversation is how sad it makes me. Displaying documents accurately was a <i>solved problem</i> in 1985 at Xerox. They had a lot of folks who were to document display what web designers are to web page display. They would go on and on and on and on and on about the kerning or the way this ligature in this language had to have this sort of thing in order to be 'correct'. They had fights with Imagen whom they considered the ""GeoCities"" of document display. Don Knuth got so fed up with how poorly computer formatted documents looked that he wrote his own formatter, and part of that included a representation (dvi) which was <i>designed</i> to be a high fidelity source that could render to the 'best possible' form on the device. These guys generally fought over printers because display terminals were 25 lines of 80 characters for the most part (unless you had a Xerox D-machine).<p>The thing that makes me sad is that we haven't been able to capture any benefit from that war. Everything patented then has expired, whether it was the special 'hinting' Xerox used on fonts or the way they maximized the fidelity of the half toning on two color printers. Sigh.",1357242963

The decision was made back in the late '80s for NeXTStep, and it just hasn't been changed since then. Apple was kinda moving toward Java in the early days of Mac OS X  WebObjects was ported to it, and it was a peer language for Cocoa up to Mac OS X 10.4 or something  but Mac users hated Java, as it was dog slow at the time, so Objective-C won by inertia.",1357242644

Their overhead is too high to take on the many smaller projects they would require to feed their cost structure.  Smaller traditional publishers face similar problems, having to make few and careful bets and so often having to sell out to survive.<p>Valve provides an interesting contrast here: with Steam/GreenLight they run a scaleable distribution channel for large numbers of small indies, taking a percentage without making particular and huge bets.  It's like an index fund vs. managed fund, where the latter does intense research into specific options.  Often that research in anchored in comparative analysis where someone has proven a juicy market exists (ex: Guitar Hero having a million clones in its wake).",1357242642

The general public simply didn't understand it well enough to recognize how pernicious an effect it really had, the news media (which is resolutely pro-status quo) wasn't going to make an issue of anything that would shift the balance of power away from the establishment, and activists realized that organizing against it was a fool's errand, since it would come down to petitioning the corrupt and asking them to give up their power and get nothing in return.<p>But as Leonard Cohen noted, there is a crack in everything - that's how the light gets in. And those cracks appeared in California. Starting with the special election that recalled Gray Davis, and installed Arnold Schwarzenegger (which put the kind of pro-reform candidate who would have never made it through the party machine into the Governors' Office) and the often-problematic-but-in-this-case-fantastic direct initiative system (which allows voters to route around obstructionist legislators) the change got through in the biggest state. The last election, which gave the GOP a huge majority in the House with a slight minority of the vote, showed people in unambiguous terms that something was very clearly wrong. And as California gets itself out from under this awful system, it'll do what it does best: drive change by demonstrating that another future is possible.",1357242521

Not your precious code. If the code you write every day was not successfully marketed your children would ask for a loaf of bread for Christmas. Marketing is not evil, or sleazy. It is the tool through which we communicate to others that we offer good and meanningful products that will improve their quality of life.<p>Spam is not an unwanted email. Spam is an email that does not, in any way, provide value to us. Nigerians telling me my rich Uncle left me $5,000,000 is not spam if I, indeed, had a rich Nigerian uncle. But I don't, so their message has no value to me.\nYou do are not spamming people when you cold email then, just like you don't bother people when you stretch out your hand and smile! The number one sales technique of shaking hands and smilling is equal to sending a friendly cold email.<p>Is cold emailing spam then? Not at all. Again, it depends on the value you are providing. Say I have a product that helps people who have disabled children. The product has been successfully tested in improving the quality of life of the parents and the children. Its downright awesome. Oh, and its an iOS app. I buy a list of the emails of people who have disabled children. Then I proceed to send them a message campaign highlighting how my app will make their lives better. Twenty five people respond and buy the app. Ten of those people who bought the app use it every day and it does, indeed, improve their lives. One email message improved their life. Is it spam? No. Because it provided value to them. But hold on. I'm not finished. Say I sent them a monthly newsletter of things they can do to improve the quality of life for their disabled children. Right on the middle of the newsletter is an advertisement for my app. Am I spamming then? No. I am providing value to them.<p>So, all those of you who put down marketing people because its sleazy to sell, read the following:<p>You would not even be a programmer if some marketing guy had not managed to successfully market computers. And that took a lot of mail campaigns (real mail). Some of it was junk, yes. But a lot of it provided value. So much in fact, that you probably learned how to code from some book or manual sold on one of the catalogs mailed, or handed out in computer stores. I personally benefited from this, because some salesman in some electronics shop convinced my parents to buy me a C64 instead of a Nintendo! Nowdays, I can provide my family with a good quality of life because one salesman decided to sell my folks on a computer. Not spam. Not sleazy. But very valuable.",1357242213

It gets a lot of giggles from people who are less experienced with Cocoa / iOS, and think that programmatically defined UI is for 'real' coders. In my experience, the amount of time you save wiring-up an app with interface builder is significant. With the editor assistant screen open, you can even drag UI element outlets directly to your code, and it will automatically insert your property declarations (and same with method actions). The idea that I'm going to grok someone else's UI code at a glance -- the same way I would looking at a visual document -- is absurd. Does interface builder fit every situation? Absolutely not.

5004167,comment,5002180,5003684,3,0,rbarooah,,,"Obviously people can argue for ever over the merits of one design decision over another but as someone who has programmed in Java for more than a decade, and has used Scala and Clojure commercially, I'd say that Objective-C does have some attractive qualities:<p>1. The object model is similar in complexity to Java (i.e. no multiple inheritance, templates, etc. that fill C++ with corner cases).<p>2. It <i>is</i> C but with an object oriented message passing layer on-top.  You can think of an Objective-C program as a bunch of  C programs that have a more loose coupled way of talking to each other.  This gives it a balance between the abstraction of a high-level language and the performance and control of C that is different from Java and most scripting languages where you need to use a native-API to talk to C.  Whether this is objectively good or not is debatable but it certainly supports Apple's strategy.  Personally I find it liberating.<p>3. The dynamism and looseness of the language make code transformation tools much harder to write - which is why XCode is only now starting to approach Eclipse on refactorings and completion.  The upside is the dynamism enables a bunch of things whose equivalents require bytecode manipulation in java - e.g. property observers, Core Data synthesized accessors, Undo proxies etc.<p>Java is evolving slowly to make these kinds of thing easier, and Objective-C is evolving slowly to a tighter language that's more amenable to automated transformation.<p>These are just a few reasons.  I think it's also fair to say that Objective-C was pretty crude and was 'behind' even as recently as 2007, but the rate of improvement since then has been high and has brought it up to date. (Declared properties, blocks, ARC, GCD, are pretty major steps into the modern era)<p>There are definitely a lot of rough edges that still remain and there's a lot more to learn than say a scripting language, plus a very different philosophy to get to grips with by comparison with the java family but once you do know it, it's a powerful language with some great strengths.<p>I'm very interested to see what happens to it over the next few years.",1357242000

Its power has been steadily eroded, leaving the electorate with less and less control over their representatives, and by extension, their government. That's the macro problem. Seeing myriad election rules from this perspective underscores why it's a mistake to argue for one partial reform (open primaries) over another (non-partisan redistricting) when really, you should be seeking to increase the power of the vote; an effort that demands both - and more.<p>California's example is especially instructive because the approach that we took was the comprehensive one. Outlawing gerrymandering and closed primaries took place at the same time. Again, of the two initiatives the politicians fought gerrymandering much harder, which should indicate which was seen as the more painful reform (for them). But the larger point wasn't that Californians were blaming a scapegoat for the intolerable level of political dysfunction. It's that they clearly identified wildly out-of-control legislators as the heart of the problem, along with key structural fixes that would shift the balance of power away from these idiots, and place it in the the hands of the voters.<p>Because that's what this is about: taking power away from legislators and making them properly dependent on the will of the people.<p>Gerrymandering is becoming a hot button issue because the electorate has finally woken up to its insidiousness. That's a good thing. As people work through it, it focuses thought on just how unrepresentative our Democracy has become. Once that problem crystalizes, then other related problems snap into focus (e.g. the primary system, private campaign finance, the filibuster rule) and the REAL problem - which is the systematic degradation of the vote - rises to the fore.<p>This will be a critical development. Until it happens, defenders of the status quo will be able to play a shell game, where some other problem is THE problem (""Gerrymandering!"" ""No, closed primaries!""). This goes around in circles, and change is delayed. But once the overarching theme emerges, and people are focused on the vote itself, then everything that damages it gets tarred with the same black brush.<p>That's the moment we should all be working for.",1357241821

If you hit the second ball a bit higher/lower than intended, it crosses the trajectory of the first ball higher/lower than intended, so it must be at the intersection point earlier/later. Luckily, you get some of that for free, as the intersection point will be closer by/farther away.<p>All else being equal, the harder you can kick, the easier this gets. The lower the arc of the first ball, the smaller the angle of intersection between the two trajectories, and the easier the hit. You can get a lower arc by giving the ball more horizontal speed, keeping vertical speed the same (just decreasing vertical speed won't help; the first ball would hit the floor before you can hit it with the second ball)<p>Of course, all else isnt equal; directional errors likely are some function increasing with both distance and ball speed.",1357241357

5004096,comment,4998472,4999194,1,0,migueldeicaza,,,"""var"" is a shorthand to not declare the type when it can be inferred, in most cases to avoid Foo foo = new Foo().   The point is that it avoid repetitive typing, while still preserving type safety and everything that comes with it: compiler checking that right types are used in the right places.<p>[Digression While it is possible to use in var foo = GetIt() the practice is discouraged because it makes the type of ""foo"" opaque to the casual reader]<p>For a parameter definition, its use clearly makes no sense.   What is the type for the following method?<p>void Demo (var x) {}<p>""var"" in the above example would not really add much value, neither would the following example, where inference will oscillate from useless to fragile, depending on who you ask:<p>void Demo (var x) { var j = x.Parent; }<p>For method return types the reason is simple, it serves no useful purpose, in fact, it can be quite damaging as the public API contract can change during routine work.   Consider a method:<p>var Demo (PointF f)\n{\n    if (f.X < 0) return f.X;\n    return 1;\n}<p>The above method signature cal oscillate easily between float or double on the day that someone changes the 1 with 1.2.   Reading a diff or a patch file wont catch the fact that you have accidentally changed the type of the function.<p>If this is the kind of code that you need to write (both cases above), then by all means, use the right tool and replace ""var"" with ""dynamic"".  I would argue that using ""dynamic"" for the sake of not declaring the type there is a poor practice, but I am not about to lecture you on poor coding choices.<p>Generic type paramters: your comment makes no sense.<p>Lamdba expressions: makes no sense, the parameters are already inferred.   Not sure what value (var x) adds over the already existing (x) syntax.<p>Which brings us to the very case I quoted ""field declarations"".<p>The ones that you skipped where it is supported: local variable declarations, for statements, using statements, consts locals and fixed statements.",1357241260

It projects a random-looking pattern which is seen by the camera and analyzed by the unit's firmware. The pattern's perspective and scale distortions are mapped into depth coordinates (perhaps aided by the visible light camera image). The device then outputs RGB+depth images via USB with a maximum frame rate of 60 fps.<p>The Leap doesn't have an infrared projector that could emit a precise pattern, but it has two infrared cameras that run at a much higher rate than the Kinect's.

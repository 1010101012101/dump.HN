4141697,comment,4141270,4141270,-4,0,lucb1e,,,"I find this a rather misguiding post.<p>First off, do you really think it's more practical to ship data per airplane than a simple cable that's already connecting you? Not that bandwidth is completely for free, but most of the time you're paying a flat fee and transferring this 1TB won't cost you anything extra. I bet that Boeing is quite a bit more expensive.<p>Secondly, at some point the article assumes the 'transfer rate' of the Boeing to be 222Mbps. While this might be true for this practical example--let's ignore that you actually need to get the data on the plane in the first place--I bet that you could load it up from bottom to top and reach practically a speed of many gigabits ifnot terabits per second.<p>Thirdly, the Boeing flies with physical stuff. If the plane crashes, the data is lost. You would need backups, which take time. Over the internet it's not even possible to transfer the original medium; you'd need to first transfer and then delete it.<p>Fourthly, while it might be true that a packet gets corrupted 28 times during this 1TB transfer (I myself do not have statistics on this, but let's assume), on the internet you can retransmit a packet. Try retransmitting that one sector on the harddrive in under a second.<p>Fifthly, the article goes on about how TCP needs to wait for an acknowledgement (or 'ack' in short). I've made this mistake before when choosing for UDP instead of TCP because ""it would not have to wait for acks and thus make my game much faster"". It's wrong because there is a so-called congestion window. I do not know the exact figures, but it's like this: The server sends packet one. Packet one is in transit. The server sends packet two. Packet one and two are in transit. The server sends packet three. Packet one arrives. Packet two and three are in transit. The server sends packet four; the client sends ack 1. Packet 2, 3, 4 and ack 1 are in transit. Etc. The thing is that the server can send up to X packets ahead, without receiving an ack.<p>Sixthly, the article finally concludes that this is why you should choose for Cloudflare--so it was an advertisement after all. That explains why it's told in this story-like way and why it contains so many technical errors.",1340282831

For one, college is an opportunity his friends are passing up (for now).<p>It reminds me of a situation a friend of mine was in. He was applying to Techstars for his startup, and then he got an internship at Facebook. He accepted, but he was trying to decide whether he should quit the internship if he got into Techstars. A professor of ours suggested that he had greater opportunities at Facebook than Techstars, because he'd meet hundreds of people in the mobile space, and that was worth more than what Techstars was going to provide him for his mobile advertising system. If he left for the ""great opportunity,"" then he would have left Facebook. By the way, that's where he joined after graduation. That was quite the opportunity that he would have passed up.<p>I agree with Dan that we always need to periodically stop and evaluate what we're doing and why. Sometimes things are done a particular way because ""that's the way it is."" If there's newer and better ways of doing something, do that. If there's another path that will get you to the same endpoint (a flourishing business), is the route going to matter that much?

Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world. When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know? [4]<p>This is easy advice to give. It's hard to follow, especially when you're young. [5] Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.<p>That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example. They like reading novels. They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes. What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist? But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.<p>Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mindthough almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.<p>Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious. If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. That's the recipe for getting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and so on. It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.<p>Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other. Your opinions about what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/love.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/love.html</a><p>probably also worth a read <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/hs.html</a>",1340280783

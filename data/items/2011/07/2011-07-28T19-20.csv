It does not avail itself of the capabilities offered in PHP5.3+ and persists in a number of outdated patterns that I consider detrimental to writing good, reusable, maintainable code. It is also incredibly slow, such that it is sort of the ""gimme"" for people wanting to write benchmarks to show how fast and awesome their new framework is.<p>Symfony2, on the other hand, is very well-designed (separating entirely from Symfony 1.3 to develop Symfony2 was a great decision), incredibly flexbile, and amazingly performant. It is, no exaggeration, <i>the</i> best PHP system I've ever seen, open-source or otherwise; unless you're Mr. Potencier, reading its code <i>will</i> make you a better PHP programmer. You can actually strip it down so far as to be just a microkernel + dispatch, which is what Silex[1] is. You can also built all manner of whatever-you-want on top of it.

Tablets (namely, iPads given that's what 90% of the market actually owns) cost $500 apiece, are easily accessible, and let business owners demo point of sale systems software right on their device, instead of just placing a call to Micros/Aloha and making a call based on specs and feature checklists, when those feature checklists include a lot of convoluted features they won't end up using.<p>The problem is, even with the revolution of availability in the space, given the poor purchasing experience with previous point of sale systems, most business owners are A) not very excited to have to purchase a point of sale and B) cannot possibly comprehend a point of sale that can run on commodity hardware. All sorts of silly questions regarding reliability crop up.<p>But, I digress. Regarding payments, I think that point of sale developers regard it as just a necessary evil that we have to roll our eyes and hold our nose that we need to integrate these payment solutions.

I would <i>love</i> for a user-centric company like Square to come in and just offer a usable API, but that's not really their gig and it's a complex situation.<p>Payments are in need of disruption, sure, but the first person to 'win' will be the one who decides they're not going to go completely vertical anymore, and has a nice, full, API with a good accounting/reporting web service to back it up. At that point, I can trust they're going to get my customers the best rates and widest acceptance possible, and I can easily write integration for them and push my customers their way.

Indeed, we have reason to believe education is one of those cases.  You simply need to examine the current state of law schools in the United States to see where marketing gets you. People fresh out of undergrad taking out six figure loans and being told the median salary at their law school is also six figures. Which it is.

The majority of American public schools don't operate with open enrollment. If you're in a public school, you're assigned to one school in a designated area, and can't choose a different school.<p>""Go to Watts and check out the selection and quality of food in supermarkets.""<p>This is just completely false and dishonest.

If it is all treated the same, then it should be ok.<p>I imagine that Google's search algo team is in a separate silo from their chrome marketing team (much like the search algo team is separated from the Adsense team) to try isolate them from the corrupting influence of their marketing team.<p>That said, Google would be risking their search cash cow  by the mere existence of this sort of campaign as it undermines the perception of the independence of their search results, so perhaps they should steer clear of offering incentives of this sort.",1325563129

He has slaughtered civilians — Muslim children by the dozens — not once or twice, but continuously in numerous nations with drones, cluster bombs and other forms of attack. He has sought to overturn a global ban on cluster bombs. He has institutionalized the power of Presidents — in secret and with no checks — to target American citizens for assassination-by-CIA, far from any battlefield. He has waged an unprecedented war against whistleblowers, the protection of which was once a liberal shibboleth. He rendered permanently irrelevant the War Powers Resolution, a crown jewel in the list of post-Vietnam liberal accomplishments, and thus enshrined the power of Presidents to wage war even in the face of a Congressional vote against it. His obsession with secrecy is so extreme that it has become darkly laughable in its manifestations, and he even worked to amend the Freedom of Information Act (another crown jewel of liberal legislative successes) when compliance became inconvenient.<p>He has entrenched for a generation the once-reviled, once-radical Bush/Cheney Terrorism powers of indefinite detention, military commissions, and the state secret privilege as a weapon to immunize political leaders from the rule of law. He has shielded Bush era criminals from every last form of accountability. He has vigorously prosecuted the cruel and supremely racist War on Drugs, including those parts he vowed during the campaign to relinquish — a war which devastates minority communities and encages and converts into felons huge numbers of minority youth for no good reason. He has empowered thieving bankers through the Wall Street bailout, Fed secrecy, efforts to shield mortgage defrauders from prosecution, and the appointment of an endless roster of former Goldman, Sachs executives and lobbyists. He’s brought the nation to a full-on Cold War and a covert hot war with Iran, on the brink of far greater hostilities. He has made the U.S. as subservient as ever to the destructive agenda of the right-wing Israeli government. His support for some of the Arab world’s most repressive regimes is as strong as ever.<p>Most of all, America’s National Security State, its Surveillance State, and its posture of endless war is more robust than ever before. The nation suffers from what National Journal‘s Michael Hirsh just christened “Obama’s Romance with the CIA.” He has created what The Washington Post just dubbed""a vast drone/killing operation,” all behind an impenetrable wall of secrecy and without a shred of oversight. Obama’s steadfast devotion to what Dana Priest and William Arkin called “Top Secret America” has severe domestic repercussions as well, building up vast debt and deficits in the name of militarism that create the pretext for the “austerity” measures which the Washington class (including Obama) is plotting to impose on America’s middle and lower classes.</i><p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/progressives_and_the_ron_paul_fallacies/singleton/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/progressives_and_the_ron_pau...</a>",1325563059

You seem to be aware of social democracy, so you are knowingly assuming a false dichotomy to make your point.

They (as a society) have already agreed to much higher income taxes, plus completely nationalised healthcare, transport and many other industries.<p>I don't mention this to say whether Finland is right or wrong in these respects - it's a democracy so I support their decisions in any case.  However, it would be foolish to say that a model of nationalised education in a country where a lot of other things are state-provided can necessarily be exported to a country where things are much-less state provided.<p>To me, there is too much focus on the school part of the education - education is clearly the output of parenting, societal attitudes as well as the school curriculum and teaching methods. Schools aren't an island - they live in a national culture, economy and even geography.  You can't just import a different teaching style into a society that may value education differently (eg is being a truant a taboo thing to do, or something that is secretly valued in an anti-hero way) and expect to get the same results.  Even the amount of time parents spend with their children will have a different result.<p>The best outcome to take from Finland is that there are many different ways to Educational outcomes - probably the most important is that the best fit between national culture and resources should be explored.  Perhaps the national (or state?) culture needs to be slowly changed before the educational system can follow.  Perhaps the idea that Federal input of education into 50 different states is a bad idea.  There are many things to look at.",1325562373

If the result of working a deep, hard problem is a solution that the world <i>obviously</i> needs, then the LS methodology does not push doing ""MVPs"" or whatever.  So if you're working on a cure for cancer, or a cheap, clean, renewable energy source, you wouldn't be following this model in the first place.   The whole ""lean startup"" / ""customer development"" approach is meant for dealing with case of extreme uncertainty, and especially in regards to market/customer knowledge.<p><i>It's all too easy to release something basic too early, see it inevitably ""fail"", and decide to ""pivot"" based upon this.</i><p>Anybody who does that doesn't understand the Lean Startup approach, and isn't doing it right.

175432,comment,175060,175060,0,0,Tichy,,,"What if you are doing it the second time around, and are already rich from the first time? Is it still painful, and will people still spend as much time on it? Somehow I can not imagine they would. Seems to me the first time is painful because of the pressure: financial worries, the worry to be a failure in life, stuff like that. Would not be so much the case if you already made it?<p>Also, isn't it amusing how such links are inevitable called ""what they don't tell you about..."" rather than simply ""It is painful to do a startup""?",1209365793

175413,comment,175186,175234,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Ditto the recommendation to kill the intro sound on the website, and extending it further to, ""the website needs some serious work"". (I understand you may not be in a position to do anything about any of this.)<p>It's got too many stock photos on the front page that don't describe anything about the company or its services -- they're just there fulfilling this ""blueness"" theme. Why is there a picture of J. Random Dude in a suit? How does that help describe or sell the service?<p>I use three-second test for website design: go to the website, look at it for three seconds, and then close the window. Now tell me everything that you learned in those three seconds. I find my eyes dancing around the page, finally landing on the bold ""Bluefin payment systems"" text at the beginning of your paragraph, and then time's up. After the three seconds is up, do I want to go take a second look at the website? Is there a draw? Well ... not really.<p>After glancing around some more, I finally find the navigation in the top left -- which is in light gray, in (the wrong kind of) subtle contrast to the blue theme everywhere else and dark page text -- and then I statr getting to the information I want, but I still have to drill down to it (click on the ""Payment Gateway"" item, which takes me to a page with all the other services that I'm not interested in, and a link to ""learn more about payment gateway"" -- basically a totally unnecessary middle step).<p>So, from a UI standpoint, the website IM(NS)HO needs a complete reworking. Then, there's the technical matter of using JavaScript mouseovers for your rollovers instead of css :hover tags, etc...<p>I dunno if Bluefin is really well-established, or still growing, or generally cares one way or the other about its website, but ... maybe somebody there'll find this helpful.",1209364073

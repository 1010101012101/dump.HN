I don&#x27;t interpret it as &quot;&#x27;Bad culture fit&#x27; always really means X&quot;, and certainly not &quot;The only reason people could dislike me is because they know I&#x27;m superior to them.&quot;  It was merely an example of the arbitrary, unfair, unstated, maybe even unconscious reasons you or your work might be rejected as an adult, which might be difficult to cope with if you are accustomed to well-reasoned, principled, and kindly explained criticism from school.<p>On the other hand, some people complain about arbitrary treatment in school, too.  I can&#x27;t think of any egregious experiences like that for myself.  Maybe these complainers are the type who make excuses for their own failings?  Maybe school vs. adult work isn&#x27;t a good contrast after all?  Anyway, I found it a better analogy than you&#x27;re giving it credit for.<p>Also, I think your tone is a bit strong.  Maybe you didn&#x27;t mean to, but it sounds like you&#x27;re accusing this person of having &quot;underlying issues with social interaction&quot; and that they often feel they&#x27;re mistreated by others and are superior to them.  That seems uncalled for, given that the original text wasn&#x27;t that direct or personal.  It was just an example.  If you feel that it implies a certain attitude of the author that you feel needs correcting, there might be more helpful ways to say it.",1430380624

It turns out to be less useful than you think, and altering language semantics in a meaningful way hampers the ability for an optimizer to make code execute efficiently (without the language&#x27;s semantics, you really can&#x27;t make assumptions).<p>> MOP needs to be severely restricted and for instance metaobjects cannot change at runtime..<p>True as far as it goes, but to the extent that they can change, the performance penalty is there <i>because</i> you can&#x27;t resolve issues at compile time. There are a variety of tricks employed to get you a hybrid model, where you effectively have a JIT optimize after dynamic binding, but if you truly have mutating metaobjects, there is an undeniable cost that you can&#x27;t get around (and the benefits really aren&#x27;t that huge).",1430380403

I&#x27;m confused that why would someone spend several thousands of dollars just for networking?<p>Why not do it you&#x27;re self? Try think of creative ways to hustle. In the book Education of Millionaires [1], there was a then young and inexperienced entrepreneur who needs to connect with other already successful entrepreneurs. He cold called every CEOs of the 30 under 30 and convinced  them to join a free ski trip with a group of young successful CEOs. He also found companies to sponsor the trip. Basically, he created a valuable network out of nowhere from this smart hack.<p>I bet if one spend 6 months full time hustling/connecting with people, one will get more value while spending less per unit time compared to a MBA. Not to mention if it is best use of time to go all out networking for an extended period of time.<p>In my view, networking is best done intermittently while doing something that produces value, like creating a startup or organizing a non-profit. In this case you have some context to network for. You&#x27;ll know better about why and how to do networking and get more value.<p>[1] The Education of Millionaires, Michael Ellsberg\n(The author&#x27;s talk about how to do networking is also very good [2])<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDmOgLabl_M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDmOgLabl_M</a>",1430379599

9463730,comment,9458919,9461682,0,0,useerup,,,"> PowerShell and its object pipeline are focused on cmdlets which are not arbitrary programs, they are .NET classes, and PowerShell objects are .NET objects.<p>Both correct and horribly wrong.<p>PowerShell is indeed focused on cmdlets (and functions) and it&#x27;s pipeline concept is focused on objects. It is also correct that cmdlets are not arbitrary programs.<p>However, cmdlets are <i>not</i> .NET classes. It is true that you <i>can</i> implement a cmdlet through a .NET class that derives from the base Cmdlet class. But that is just <i>one</i> way to create a cmdlet that can be recognized by PowerShell. You can build cmdlets using PowerShell itself. There is <i>nothing</i> in the PowerShell specification (<a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=36389"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id...</a>) that require a cmdlet to be a .NET class.<p>If you use PowerShells (rich) introspection function to enquire about a cmdlet, there is nothing objective to give it away as either .NET class based or advanced function based (advanced functions are cmdlets). Yes, you can see if a module (distribution unit of cmdlets, providers, functions etc) are &quot;binary&quot; or &quot;script&quot;. That merely reinforces the argument that cmdlets are not classes.<p>Indeed, PowerShell will now dynamically create a new type of cmdlets based on an Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) implementation. Think managed routers, switches, Linux boxes etc. If they expose a REST service that complies with OMI, PowerShell can query the capabilities and create cmdlets in-session for each individual type of equipment. PowerShell has since v3 been able to create WMI/CIM cmdlets.<p>The point is that your assertion that cmdlets are .NET classes is both factually wrong, and grossly misleading. Saying that PowerShell cmdlets are .NET classes is like saying that Yum packages are just archives. Sure, you can pick one apart and say &quot;look! it&#x27;s a .NET class&quot;. I can pick a Yum package apart and say: &quot;look! it&#x27;s just an archive with some files in it!&quot;.<p>That said, it is true that PowerShell builds upon .NET. It is implemented using .NET and the object model is based on .NET. PowerShell&#x27;s type system is a superset of .NETs - because an administrators tool needs more ad-hoc typing.<p>We have gotten so used to think that sh shells were developed with pipelines like that (streams stdin/stdout) because the <i>commands</i> are like that. In reality, the commands and the (first) shells were developed in tandem so that the commands would fit the shell and vice versa.<p>What Microsoft is doing with PowerShell is challenge that commands must be &quot;like that&quot;. If we make the commands &quot;richer&quot; and allow them to use a higher level protocol (objects) for inter-command communication, an even smarter shell can be built. Yes, it does create some friction with traditional commands. PowerShells solution is to regard those as &quot;cmdlets&quot; that just consume sequences of strings (which are objects) and produce sequences of strings.<p>> Unix shells like sh and bash are focused on tying together separate programs and only have a very minimal set of built-in commands.<p>PowerShell is focused on tying together separate cmdlets and only has a very minimal set of build-on commands. See?<p>(Aside: Actually, PowerShell is more terse than any sh shells: It has 0 (zero) &quot;built-in&quot; commands. What it is has is a module concept with auto-discovery. The seemingly &quot;built-in&quot; are not built in. Those cmdlets comes from modules that are distributed alongside the PowerShell binary, and PowerShell auto-loads them as it will any module that is placed in the correct location. sh shells needs commands like e.g. &quot;cd&quot; that manipulate the environment to be built-in. You could never implement &quot;cd&quot; as an external command. In PowerShell &quot;cd&quot; (alias for the Set-Location cmdlet) is distributed through the Microsoft.PowerShell.Management module)<p>> The focus of each one is very different, despite PowerShell&#x27;s syntax. Piping objects between cmdlets in PowerShell is analogous to working with objects in Python, Ruby, Perl, etc, not like Unix pipes.<p>No it is <i></i>not<i></i>. A pipeline is exactly that: A temporary communications channel that is set up for the duration of the (compound) command, and through which <i>multiple</i> objects flow. In PowerShell the individual cmdlets - like commands in a sh pipeline - are active a the same time. From the PowerShell spec: &quot;<i>A pipeline is a series of one or more commands each separated by the pipe operator | (U+007C). Each command receives input from its predecessor and writes output to its successor.</i>&quot;<p>Re: Python, Ruby, Perl, etc: You can create a pipeline concept for those languages as well. See for instance pypi (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/python-pipelines/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/python-pipelines/</a>). But it is like you want to portrait PowerShell pipelines as mere method invocations. They are considerably more.",1430379091

So we can give line number info if you break on any instruction? Seems to me you&#x27;d &quot;just&quot; need to augment debug info with performance classes, then let the profiler display worry about classification after the fact.",1430377971

In that case I guess the problem is sort of solved but then I need to start thinking a layer higher than I have been.<p>It would be nice if the solution to this proliferation still allowed me to think at the level of [synaptic/apt-get/dpkg] on Debian/Ubuntu/... or [yum/rpm] on Redhat/CentOS/Suse/... and so on.

When we were in the apartment, we found out that it wasn&#x27;t cleaned. Used bed sheets were on the floor and still on some beds, tables were dirty. The host obviously forgot to clean it. I contact the host, but couldn&#x27;t get hold of him, since he&#x27;s in another time zone. I called Airbnb and send them pictures of the place, and asked what to do. The Airbnb support guy basically told us that the apartment was clean enough to stay for the night, and we have to resolve the issue with the host ourselves. That was the first time I have talked to Airbnb support, and the experience was just awful. We ended up staying at hotel for that night on our own dime, but the host was kind enough afterwards to refund the booking fee.",1430377345

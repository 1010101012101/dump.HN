Touch. :-p<p>GAE just avoids it alltogether (except locally, where you have CPython and use it to stub out core services hosted on the cloud runtime).  You simply can&#x27;t import sqlite3 on GAE when running on cloud runtime, nor can you really use it as an external dependency.<p>I&#x27;m not really up on the details, but the PyPy website claims they&#x27;ve gotten around this by implementing a pure Python equivalent of the CPython stdlib library (<a href=""http://pypy.org/compat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypy.org/compat.html</a>).<p>I would put forward that SQLite3 is probably a pretty easy include in most C projects compared to whatever numpy would likely require.   That said, I&#x27;m not qualified to assess this, being neither a numpy, Python core, or sqlite3 dev.<p>All of this aside, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that the entire standard lib includes and depends on some other C-only libraries.  So it&#x27;s not unprecedented.  In principle, you&#x27;d want the standard lib to have as much pure Python as possible (PyPy kind of takes this to the ultimate extreme from what I can gather), but this isn&#x27;t always practical (great example of &quot;practicality beats purity&quot; if you ask me).<p>Speaking of which, if it&#x27;s cool to have `sqlite3` in the standard lib as part of the included batteries, why not mean and variance and the like? :D",1376217025

(But also no)<p>The problem is that in the &quot;western world&quot; there are complex systems designed to preserve both widespread individual liberty as well as consensual governance (for convenience I&#x27;ll call these &quot;free systems&quot;). However, we tend to merely label these systems as &quot;democracy&quot; even though many other systems that have popular voting can exist which do not offer the same protections of liberty and consensual governance. This terminology and modeling problem makes it more difficult to spread the aforementioned &quot;free systems&quot; of government because it&#x27;s very much more difficult to elucidate all of the factors behind such systems, some of which are socio-cultural and economic.<p>One common pattern in &quot;unfree&quot; countries that have experienced bouts of democracy is for there to be a popular vote that brings in a government that then ends all of the democratic institutions. This has happened routinely for well over a century. Another problem is that you have a corrupt group in power with few checks on their authority and they simply rig every election in one way or another.<p>I think it&#x27;s mistaken to believe that it takes generations for a country to be ready for freedom and effective democracy merely because naive attempts to set up democracies can easily fail. I think it&#x27;s also a mistake to assume that countries with long histories of democratic institutions and liberty are comparatively immune to collapses of those institutions.<p>Much like the situation with economics we tend to live within political systems which rest on foundations that are not widely well understood, if at all, and rarely even discussed in depth at an abstract foundational level.<p>It&#x27;s no wonder it&#x27;s so difficult for countries to try to bootstrap their way to democracy and it&#x27;s a bit of a shock that our own systems of government in the &quot;free&quot; world work as well as they do.",1376215645

It was not designed for light-weight use in command-line scripts.<p>&quot;import scipy.stats&quot; takes 0.25 second on my laptop. In part because it brings in 439 new modules to sys.modules. That&#x27;s crazy-mad for someone who just wants to compute, say, a Student&#x27;s t-test, when the implementation of that test is only a few dozen lines long.

In one networked filesystem I worked with (Lustre), the stat calls were so slow that just starting python took over a second. We fixed that by switching to zip import of the Python standard library and deferring imports unless they were needed, but there&#x27;s no simple solution like that for SciPy.<p>- less confusing docstring/help<p>Suppose you read in the documentation that scipy.stats.t implements the Student&#x27;s t-test as scipy.stats.t.<p><pre><code>    >>> import scipy.stats

Only, help() gets confused about that because help() uses the class docstring while SciPy modifies the generator instance&#x27;s docstring. Instead, to see the correct docstring you have to do it directly:<p><pre><code>    >>> print scipy.stats.t.__doc__
    A Student&#x27;s T continuous random variable.

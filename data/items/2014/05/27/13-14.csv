7804474,comment,7803830,7803830,12,0,filearts,,,"The beauty of Excel is its ability to do many things &#x27;well enough&#x27; in a way that is accessible to a lot of people.<p>My dad put together his architectural plans for a new house in Excel because it is a tool with which he felt comfortable. Some people do calendars in Excel while others try and recreate a full General Ledger system. Because it works well enough, people don&#x27;t see the need to invest the time in learning a new application and instead invest their time in pushing the limits of the tool.<p>As someone who builds financial models and who audits those built by others (and is a competent programmer by night), I think that the key source of risk in Excel models is that the tool has no knowledge of intentions.  What I mean by this is that if I&#x27;m building a cash flow model or if I&#x27;m doing a pixel drawing, Excel doesn&#x27;t care; as users, we are forced to create our own structure and build in our own checks and balances. If I make a balance sheet in Excel that doesn&#x27;t balance, Clippy won&#x27;t show up and let me know that things are broken.<p>I&#x27;ve often thought that it would be really amazing if a semantic layer could be built that uses Excel as the calculation backend. This sort of tool could understand the sorts of concepts of financial statements, projections, time-series and other concepts that often show up in financial models. It would have a built-in understanding of the domain-specific models that would let it leverage that understanding to reduce risk in the building of financial models. If I told it that I wanted to add a revenue stream that is tied to the output of production, the tool would connect the dots between the production schedule, any inflation and/or foreign exchange assumptions and would feed changes in working capital according to the associated collection terms, etc...<p>Before I get too carried away, the point is that this type of semantic layer would be much better at preventing and detecting anomalies and potential errors in the development of a high-risk financial model. Does anyone have experience with any such tools?",1401199128

The developer API they plan on releasing will only give you the post processed signal + the raw IMU signal - that is to say, they&#x27;ll tell you the current affinity to each of the pre-programmed gestures (~6 or so) that Thalmic has set up. There is no way to normally get access to the EMG data.<p>They will however give you units with &#x27;special firmware&#x27; if you sign up for their researcher partnership program which costs $10k+ the last time I talked to them (this winter).

The worst part is just how understandable it is.<p>Nearly all the players in this field are startups of some sort. Their #1 goal is to get stable positive cash flow out of some niche market. As a hardware startup, they have significant costs to overcome. There just is no incentive for them to split off some effort to try to capture this type of open system/market.<p>But seriously, I crave an open hardware platform for this. But at the same time, it&#x27;s obvious that the costs are non-trivial. The &#x27;science&#x27; part of the payload isn&#x27;t even hard. IMU + microprocessor + bluetooth. The hard part is hardware packaging, getting it into a form factor that has enough battery life, will stay in position on the body, will not adversely bother the user, or modify their movement.

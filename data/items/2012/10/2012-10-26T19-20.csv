This is the same model that Paypal follows.<p>Since there is clearly a demand for buying bitcoins _quickly_, I believe Brian is providing both a good UX for those who want to just use their account / routing numbers, while also allowing people to get bitcoins in LESS THAN 10 MINUTES (I bought 1BTC today with coinbase / wells fargo).<p>I should note that Mint did the same thing in order to get access to transaction history, and they had 5 million registered users as of 2011 (source: <a href=""http://qr.ae/8QB9G"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qr.ae/8QB9G</a>).<p>If the big banks addressed the need for APIs, startups like Mint and Coinbase could do this in a more sane way, but we're talking about big banks, and in the case of Wells Fargo they actually charge users a monthly fee for using Quicken to talk to their backend.<p>tl;dr- Mint asked users for bank passwords and got 5 million registrations.

So your ""one option would be not to support JS"" proposal is directly contradictory with your selected example (the Chromebook) of a single-function computing gadget.<p>More generally, I'll echo the concerns of everyone else here: we seem to be getting greener by using more-general-purpose computing, that necessitates less devices, and less frequent upgrading.  Especially because we now see that once devices reach a certain level of power, we actually buy new ones far less often.  (Many people now happily own 5-year-old desktops, not because they cannot afford more, but because they're too LAZY to buy a new one for the small marginal benefits... and laptops are headed slowly in that direction.  Cell phones and tablets are still far from that transition.)<p>On the other hand...  your observation about the 3% penetration in India, assuming it's factually true, does sound like SOME kind of an opportunity.  Making things radically cheaper is always an important disruption (c.f. the original sense of ""disruptive innovation"", which doesn't just mean ""we beat the competition"").  And certainly if you can sell to 0.01% of Indian farmers (say 100k households?), that's a hell of a lot of units over which to amortize the high fixed cost of circuit design and tape-out.  Although only if you really can come up with a single design that meets the needs of such a huge and probably diverse market.  Sounds very hard.<p>Plus, of course, as many sages (e.g. pg) observe repeatedly, if it were obviously a good idea then your competition would already have done it, which means that IF it's ACTUALLY a good idea, the crowd of naysayers here (myself included) is a good sign for your project.  ;)<p>In short, I'm really sceptical about your fundamental hypothesis, but good luck with figuring it out.",1351279651

Moving ""into the cloud"" <i>is</i> moving to a distributed model, and generally app engine will protect you from single points of failure. As others have noted, if you distribute your own self-managed servers across the globe, you end up with a very similar system, but now you have to manage it.<p>What appears to be happening here is that you're still vulnerable because the C&C infrastructure ultimately has a single command source, and so can be vulnerable if some code is pushed that affects the whole system. Your homegrown cloud will suffer from the same vulnerability, it may just be more or less easy to manage depending on how specialized your needs are compared to the more general requirements of GAE.<p>Edit: actually, maybe I missed what you're advocating with ""local direct connections"". This might make more sense from a user's perspective: if everyone ran their own little cloud, a failure may bring down reddit, but not reddit, heroku, pinterest, etc simultaneously. That's actually an interesting point, but I'm not sure if it really matters if they sync up their downtimes (since they would still have downtime, and maybe more or less of it depending on how much they could afford to invest into managing their distributed solution). I'm also not sure if that really solves the problem, since there are other concentrations in the network, just less visible ones (there are a fairly small number of major datacenters around the world, for instance, and managing your own colocated server doesn't matter if the whole building goes dark).<p>I do agree that at the very least we need to maintain an ecosystem of ""cloud"" providers, however.",1351279244

Using that mechanism will make your service much more familiar and acceptable to people, whereas asking for a username and password raises huge red flags.<p>I only know of one other service that asks for bank account usernames and passwords: mint.com.  And they frequently have to deal with customer concerns about the security of doing so, even though they very explicitly say they only provide read-only access.  Your service doesn't even have that guarantee.<p>So: drop the username and password thing, and <i>only</i> support the standard verify-two-small-transfers option that every other service uses.",1351278483

Since we're automatically reconciling user accounts based on authenticated emails, this makes LinkedIn kind of the odd man out.<p>As far as traction, LinkedIn represents approximately 30-35% of our users who are authenticating via oAuth, which is only about about 32% of total users.  So, one out of three users logs in with oAuth (vs. traditional username/password auth), and of those, 2 out of three prefer Google to LinkedIn -- and this is on our Enterprisey product.<p>In other side projects, LinkedIn usage is far less.  Perhaps one out of 15 users prefer it to Facebook / Google / Twitter, and it's probably worth noting that in the consumer-based apps (games and the like), users prefer oAuth 3 to 1.",1351278237

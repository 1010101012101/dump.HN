So comparing one ""inflation adjusted"" number to another from 43 years ago and getting concerned over a difference of a mere couple of hundred bucks (about three percent) is pretty meaningless.<p>The biggest flaw in the article seems to be the assumption that the inflation-adjusted income of the median worker <i>should</i> be increasing.

  move 20 to b
  move contents of b to a
</code></pre>
The fact that programmers use '=' in a way that non-programmers would never use it should not be part of any 'aptitude' test. That's just syntax and it would give anybody with even a cursory knowledge of programming a huge advantage. Even just the assumption that statements are to be executed in a particular sequence greatly affects the outcome of tests like this and you may have to specify such a thing up-front if you expect people to be on a level playing field.<p>Note that I'm not saying that the conclusion of the paper is wrong, I simply object to the hidden assumptions behind the design of the test. Removing those assumptions would be pretty tricky thing to do with 100% accuracy, and in the end the conclusions reached in the paper might still stand (but I doubt that they would be the same in magnitude).",1315936719

For one thing, you need to decide the granularity of ""feature"". It can be anywhere from the entire project to a single line of code. It can actually get even more specific when you start talking about combinations of things as a ""feature"".<p>If you try to apply a ""only 5% of users will use this"" rule to any significant project, I think it will quickly start to feel incomplete. Users can tell. They develop expectations about the features that should be present in a certain class of application. When they come across a need for the feature, even if very minor, they will be very frustrated if it's not present. That frustration will destroy the user community.<p>Another thing is that often software is bought in bulk for an organization. The accountants will demand support for X in the standard software package, and IT will demand Y, and pretty soon you need a full-featured product. If you say ""only 4% use X and only 3% use Y"", and eliminate both, then you've just lost an entire organization worth of users.<p>If you're a startup or have a new product, then I'm not saying you need to reach that level of maturity before 1.0 release.

They have deeper pockets generally, but raising your rates just because you can is a little unethical.  The reality is that the agency is at the mercy of the client and both parties are fighting hundreds of constantly changing (usually unseen) variables, and so they are willing to pay a premium in the interest of getting things done on time and done well.  So yes, you will have to unexpectedly work on weekends, or work on requirements that sound backwards or are overly complex, but you will be compensated for that extra effort.<p>Also, unlike some of your non-agency clients, you may often be exposed to projects that are ""award-winning"", or will have an enormous audience, or take advantage of some new, hot technology.

It's inherent from the topology: as a circle, the pie chart is closed, implying that there is no additional data and that only the ratios are important. A series such as a bar chart or table is not closed, carrying the implication that it might simply have been truncated for reasons of space or clarity.

I wish I had this when shopping for insurance a year ago.<p>A ""total annual cost"" column would be helpful for making sense of the deductible/premium/co-pay relationship.  Think of it as the ""Price+Shipping+Tax"" on shopping websites.<p>Ask the user how much he expects his doctors to charge him (""Annual Medical Bill"") in the next twelve months, then calculate how much he would pay to the doctors and to the insurance company.  Last time I bought health insurance I had to make a spreadsheet to calculate this. I would rather not repeat that mundane task again.<p>It might also be useful to have multiple predefined Annual Med Bills  ($0, $1,000, $5,000, $20,000, etc). Displaying the output on a graph might make sense (AnnMedBill vs TotalAnnCost, with a curve for each plan).  You should customize these to the user's age (a 23 year old may not go to the doctor for years at a time, but even a healthy 50yo will definitely go several times per year for checkups and *oscopies).<p>Mapping costs to life events (no doctor visits, a few visits, broken arm, healthy pregnancy, etc) would make it even more useful, but researching the necessary assumptions will take considerable work so just implement predefined dollar amounts as a version 1.<p>Keep up the good work, this idea has value!",1315934949

[""same way""] Netscape had a monopoly, it wasn't injecting JS into a situation where there was already a scripting language widely used on the web and implemented among multiple competing browsers. It was not fragmenting a multi-lateral browser market or web content language ecosystem.<p>2. [""same reasons""] The Dart reasons adduced in the leaked memo are nothing like our reasons at Netscape for doing JS. We (marca and I, mostly) wanted a language for non-Java programmers, non-programmers even, which could be written directly in HTML. A language designers, beginners, amateurs could learn by the yard. We did that without failing to upgrade a prior such language already widely supported.<p>Dart, according to the leaked memo, aims to replace JS because JS can't be fixed. But who says JS can't be fixed? Why, the people making Dart, working at the dominant web company of the last decade! That's no ""reason"", it is a choice.<p>""I see the free market offering alternatives.""<p>Uh huh. If Dart has native support only in Chrome, then it's not an alternative for people using other browsers. Then what?<p>The ""free market"" is a bogus political phrase. I'm in favor of markets: real ones that self-regulate by preventing fraud (a central clearing/blinding counter-party, bid/offer/open-interest/size transparency) and abuse of power (market winners capture governments -- this has happened throughout history, it's a big problem right now, see the Global Financial Crisis).<p>Talking about Google's anti-standards power games in the current multi-lateral browser market as if it's all ""free market"" goodness is b.s.<p>""If I'm not mistaken, IE supports Javascript, right?""<p>Think, floppybunny, think! IE supports JS because Netscape had a monopoly once it took over from Mosaic and grew the web via commercialization (SSL, another Netscape innovation). IE had no choice but to support ""JScript"", and indeed they were thus motivated to help standardize ES1. Standards, hmm.<p>Google has no such monopoly. The likely outcome of putting a native Dart VM into Chrome and (again per the leaked memo) using Dart for web app development in Google is not to make other browsers roll over and embed the native Dart VM as well.<p>Can you see Apple doing that? Microsoft? Mozilla would be expected to do it by all you bring-on-the-new-monopoly fanboys, but even if we did it wouldn't help.<p>We're in a multi-browser market. Competitors try (some harder than others, <i>pace</i> Alex Russell's latest blog post) to work together in standards bodies. This does not necessarily mean everything takes too long (Dart didn't take a month or a year -- it has been going longer than that, in secret).<p>Open standards development does not mean design-by-committee, either. Multi-browser collaboration among Apple, Mozilla, and Opera was what created HTML5.<p>Dart goes the wrong way and is likely to bounce off other browsers. It is therefore anti-open-web in my book. ""The end justifies the means"" slaves will say ""but but but it'll eventually force things to get better"". Maybe it will, but at high cost. More likely, it won't, and we'll have two problems (Dart and JS).<p>""Let's argue languages based on technical merits, not how or by whom they were developed.""<p>Now that's just low. You know damn well that Google has kept Dart a secret, so none of us can assess its technical merit (maybe you work for Google and can?).<p>Sure, when Dart is released, let's argue in a new thread. <i>This</i> thread is about the fragmenting, essentially two-faced politics of the leaked JS strategy memo, and whether and why that's bad for the web.<p>If you want a new monopoly to sweep the web clean, bully for you. No such monopoly exists now, so realists will still have to work in standards bodies. Is Google really working in standards bodies? As Maciej Stachowiak points out in this thread and over on reddit, more and more of their extensions in Chrome are not being standardized, and apparently won't be proposed ""later"".",1315934804

The guidance I found on the web tended to be generic, rather than targeted at the type of plan I wanted (major medical).<p>Perhaps you could outline a few broad plan types, explain the advantages, and allow users to pick one?<p>For example, I would have picked a ""major medical plan"", and it would have shown me plans that have solid out-of-pocket maximums that aren't much higher than the deductible. The data displayed for each plan would highlight differences between those plans (e.g. HSA-eligible) that might not be so important to a another plan type (e.g. full service plans).",1315934347

However, using agents in Clojure - which would more closely mirror the old Scala code - would only add a few lines.<p>I think the Scala code could be made quite a bit more concise because of the advances in Scala over the last two years.

2992327,comment,2991867,2992145,8,0,dxbydt,,,"Ok, so Hefferon was my textbook for 2 full semesters. Lots of problems with this book. Hefferon is an algebraist, so the computational aspect of linear algebra ie. the stuff you are most likely to use linalg for at your workplace, has been given short shrift. Instead, the author gives fullblown treatment to theorem proving in vector spaces. So you are spending a lot of time constructing isomorphisms between subspaces....that shit is neat for a math major, which I was, but now that I'm in the workplace, I find what the world calls ""linear algebra"" isn't what Hefferon cares about.<p>eg. One of the basics you must absolutely know, or so I've been told, is how to do a PCA, and why a PCA is not the same as regression. So if you've got multidimensional data, say data in 7 dimensions ( risk ratio, fico score, salary, age etc etc ), you want to know if you can reduce that whole set to say 1 dimension. ie. can you transform the original set of 7 variable vectors into a much smaller set of 1 variable vectors that captures 90% of the information in the original ? If so, how ? Turns out you construct a linear combination of correlated variables. Ok, but there's infinitely many combinations. So how ? Well, construct it in such a fashion that the variance of the combination is maximized. That component is called the Principal Component, and its the single most used technique to reduce dimensionality in the industry. So you've taken a 7-dimension space and nicely reduced it to a 1-dimension subspace with maximum variance that explains 90% of the original 7 dimension space. Its quite amazing actually.
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis</a><p>Similarly, there are a whole bunch of very common stuff you'd actually use linear algebra for in CG - translation, rotation in 3D, shear matrices and the like. Hefferon doesn't do those either.<p>In portfolio theory which is my bread and butter (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_theory</a> ) almost everything I do is very properly linear algebra. But again, Hefferon doesn't offer any insight into how/why finding a vector with minimum variance can yield better returns in a vector space of portfolios.",1315933504

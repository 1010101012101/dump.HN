Maybe it's ""male-centric"" to insist that only the quality of the work matters - but personally I say that quality of work transcends gender and speaks for itself. Because my long experience of this industry is that we are the least biased people on the planet, gay, straight, black, white, boy, girl, fat, then, it doesn't matter if you can deliver. And if you can't deliver - the excuses that work in the rest of the world - don't cut it with us.",1306915165

But we should take care here, a few points:<p>firstly the anthropology is terribly negative and the conclusion are that without government we would leave in a violent state of nature. It's not that clear that without government the situation would be so violent and moreover, from scientific point of view, it's also not that clear that there was such a state of nature: homo sapiens could well have been really civilized when he became home sapiens.<p>Secondly Hobbes never concludes that we should be armed or anything like that. No. He concludes that we need a powerful state and that to build this state we need to give up some of our rights. We give some rights and the state acquire the obligation to protect us. If you think about it it goes totally against the American vision: Hobbes would probably agree that the citizen should give up their rights to be armed, to throw out the state of nature, and in return the state would protect them. This seems really hobbesian, not the reverse.",1306912133

I'm confident that after I graduate I made some serious friends (and connections) here not only because I had the experience of being forced to socialize with a new group of people, but also that I know everyone else was in the same position.<p>I'd almost say that the network itself is worth the price I paid for college. Just looking at the people I know, I can probably connect myself to someone in any of the top 20 US schools in one or two degrees of separation. I assume this is how things like banking and executive networks are built, although that's not my field.",1306912080

Square needs to stick with the dongle for now so as not to give the perception that it is inferior. It's a bit like Apple's release strategy: the features are always a bit behind but the overall user experience is exceptional and creates demand for future releases.<p>New payment systems face a nearly insurmountable chicken-and-egg problem. By taking advantage of an existing infrastructure, one side of the equation is addressed neatly. The FaceCash thing is more reminiscent of PayByTouch (minus the fraud, I suppose) where you've got zero merchants, zero account holders and you're trying to push an unfamiliar and even awkward user experience.",1306912045

Guess what? Most truly skilled people learned almost everything by themselves.
Generally speaking most intelligent people learn by themselves (if there are means to do it) and find themselves a little alienated from the general culture.<p>My point is simply if you want to achieve exceptional results you will most likely be an exceptional person too.

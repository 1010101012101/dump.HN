5486061,comment,5485236,5485876,8,0,ajuc,,," > No, that's not very rational. Cryopreservation may have low chances of success, but it's like a billion billion billion times better than just dying (which has zero chance of success). Nobody is claiming that cryopreservation is very probable, but it's a lot better than nothing.<p>That's basically Pascal Bet (if there's God you get infinite payoff, if there's no God you get finite negative payoff (wasted time caused by being believer), so to maximize payoff you should believe in God). The problem is - there are very many possible gods, many of them incompatibile with each other. You should consider the bet with ALL gods as possible options, not just some god versus no god.<p>Same with the cryogenic. You should consider the possibility that freezing you with our poor technology can make you unrecoverable, while some other technology could allow you to be saved eventually.<p>Also I'm sorry for Mr Banks, I love his books about Culture.",1364997573

Modern supportive care means that chemotherapy does not involve constant vomiting, pain and torment. Some patients work and look after their family in between having chemotherapy. For example, in a large study on the efficacy of chemotherapy in biliary tract cancers including gallbladder cancer the rates of severe vomiting were only 5% (<a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908721"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908721</a>). And when it does happen, it doesn't go on for 'months'.<p>2. If you shrink the cancer people feel better ie treatment can improve quality of life, that's why we do it.<p>3. Some cancers are indolent. This means that people can live for a long time with them, whether they have treatment or not. See Stephen Jay Gould's essay for example (<a href=""http://www.cancerguide.org/median_not_msg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancerguide.org/median_not_msg.html</a>)<p>4. Participating in clinical trials is a standard part of cancer management. You don't have to be famous to receive experimental therapies if you want them.<p>Having said all that, chemotherapy IS primitive and doesn't work as well as it should, and hopefully we won't still be using the same stuff we are now in 50 years. But it can help people, and trying it is not crazy or hopeless, and an extra couple of months might mean a lot to a particular individual.",1364995282

The National Woman's Party, which was the militant branch of the Suffrage Movement, started pushing for the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923 and ""the Republican Party endorsed the ERA in its 1940 platform, and the Democratic Party followed suit in 1944."" (Quoting from <a href=""http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/titlevii.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/titlevii.htm</a> ). The Equal Pay Act also has its roots in the 1800s.<p>It feels then like 40 years of work towards gender equality in the workplace - including the inroads made during WWII by seeing that women can definitely hold jobs in industry - are ignored by the three-wave view of history, and that the successes of that ignored era are claimed solely as 2nd wave victories.<p>In any case, that's neither here nor there.

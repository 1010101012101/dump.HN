5291371,comment,5286406,5289101,2,0,enjo,,,"In that case? Not very much different at all, but that's missing the point. Think of it this way (I apologize, this is going to get obtuse):<p>Imagine you're a barista. You clock in and start doing barista things. You have three responsibilities. You have to take orders from customers and you have to pour coffee. When there are not customers you have to clean the shop.<p>The rules:<p>- You must take at least two orders if there is a line, but no more before you start pouring coffee. You should never have more than two outstanding orders at a time.<p>- If you have no customers in line and no coffee to pour, you must clean the shop.<p>Lets do it with generators (again pseudo code):<p><pre><code>  function day_of_work() {
    generator take_orders() {
        orders = array()

        while(during_shift()) {
           while(customers_in_line()) {
             if(length(orders) >= 2) {
                yield orders
             } else {
               orders.push(take_customer_order())
             }
           }

           yield orders
        }

    generator clean_shop() {
        unpack_coffee()
        yield
        
        clean_espresso_machine()
        yield

        take_out_trash()
        yield
    }
 
    while(orders = take_orders.next()) {
        if(length(orders) > 0) {
          pour_coffee(orders.pop())
        } else {
          clean_shop.next()
        }
    }
</code></pre>
There are lots of cool things going on here.<p>First notice that these generators not only have variable state, but they also have <i>control flow</i> state and THAT is why they're different. Notice that take_orders will yield control if more than two orders exist in the queue. It will also yield control if no more customers are in line. So our main program loop is really simple. It gets the current set of orders from ""take_orders"". Once the order queue is full it starts pouring coffee.<p>Notice what happens when no orders are present. Clean shop is executed once per iteration. It first unpacks the coffee, and then yields control. Now we go back and check for more orders, if we find them we fill them until we don't have any more again. Then it's back to cleaning shop, but we pick back up RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF! So we just start cleaning the espresso machine... this goes on and on until the work day ends at which point take_orders cleanly exists and orders is null. Then we pack up and go home.<p>Now you might go: Well I can implement that in Javascript! You'd be right! Closures + callbacks make it totally possible. Lets take a stab at it:<p><pre><code>  orders = [];
  current_task = -1;

  while(during_work_day()) {
       take_orders(
            orders,
            function(order) { pour_coffee(order); },
            function() { current_task++; clean_shop(current_task); }
       );
  }

  function take_orders(orders, orders_full_callback, no_orders_callback) {
      if(customers_in_line()) {
          if(orders.length > 2) {
              orders_full_callback(orders.pop());
          } else {
              orders.push(take_customer_order());
          }
      } else {
          no_orders_callback();
      }
  }

  function clean_shop(current_task) {
      switch(current_task) {
        case 0:
            unpack_coffee()
            break
        case 1:
            clean_espresso_machine()
            break
        case 2:
            take_out_trash()
            break
        default:
            do_nothing()
      }
  }
</code></pre>
So that will work. Every iteration we look for customers, if the queue is full we callback to start pouring coffee. We clean the shop if nothing is going on.<p>Notice that our callbacks are closures. However, the callbacks do not have <i>execution state</i>. This means we have to manage state externally in the form of <i>current_task</i>.<p>Now for a trivial example like this, that might not be a big deal. However, imagine that we had a whole list of things to do when there weren't customers. Lets make it even harder, and have those tasks depend on state.<p>For instance what if we actually had a bunch of separate tasks we had to do:<p>- unload the truck<p>- draw something cool on the chalkboard<p>- clean the shop<p>What if the order those should be done in depended on state?<p>Before 1:00 PM the priority is:<p>#1 draw something cool<p>#2 unload the truck<p>#3 clean the shop<p>After 1:00PM the priority changes:<p>#1 unload the truck<p>#2 draw something cool<p>#3 clean the shop<p>After 3:00PM the priority changes again!<p>#1 clean the shop<p>#2 unload the truck<p>#3 draw something cool<p>Now think about how hard this is going to be in Javascript. You're going to have to maintain state for three separate jobs (where am I in that job), but also deal with making sure you're working on them in the right order.<p>What makes generators so damn handy is that the state is internalized. I only need to change the order I invoke the generators. As long as I keep calling next() until there aren't any items left...they'll just keep churning through whatever they're doing in the first place. They become more expressive as the complexity of the state they are managing increases. Things that are hard to do in languages that don't support them, are often pretty easy with generators. Do some work, yield, do some more work, yield... becomes a very simple pattern to reason about while not having to manage all of the state you have to do in other languages.<p>I hope that helps clear it up a bit:)",1361955315

This is most visible in strictly informational sectors, such as free software, music and publishing, but I don't think it's constrained to that but rather the effect of adding ""intelligence"". The end game of a company like AirBnB for instance, is to replace (all) hotels, for a fraction of the turnover (but higher profit margin). The same could be true of self driving cars -- we believe it will let us make do with fewer cars, because they are easier to share. Indeed, Google is perhaps the foremost example, incessantly cutting away at the advertising sector (along with related industries), filling the same purpose but better and an order of magnitude cheaper.<p>This is not growth, but degrowth. The thing is, it is still good and valuable -- it's just that it's not reflected in GDP.<p>I would say that this has been going on for a few decades, which is why we've seen the rise of the financial sector, which seems, to me, to be a kind of ""manufactured growth"" --  all of our politics and policies expect, indeed, <i>demands</i> growth in order to work.

5291271,comment,5287890,5290965,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"No, I'm not sure why you're so dedicated to promoting Django's negative qualities as if they're virtues. The rigidity is <i>not</i> preferable, in any circumstance. It's simply less adaptive, and therefore less useful, architecture.<p>If you want simple, you can use adaptive frameworks simply. They come with defaults just like Django does. The difference is that it's easy to swap or mix-and-match components, and it's an intended use case. On Django, if you don't go with vanilla, it's a hack.<p>As I wrote elsewhere, ""batteries included"" doesn't (or shouldn't) mean ""batteries hard-welded"". It's fine to include stuff and have defaults; adaptive frameworks have these too, but they considered the fact that someone may want to do something irregular at some point and that it shouldn't be a world-breaking experience for that to happen. A framework that understands its place is all gain, in that it doesn't intrude and try to force something, and no loss, in that it also comes with defaults that you can just use if you aren't yet at a stage where you'd have a reason to replace them, and therefore, from an objective technical standpoint, it is a better choice. Perhaps social issues override this in some situations, but those can't be considered in our removed, objective, technical context.<p>>I'll be the first to bemoan Django for its flaws (it has many, as do all frameworks), but this is absurdly misguided thinking. There are tons of success stories to the contrary, with new ones adding to the pile every day.<p>It doesn't matter if there are success stories. I'll repeat myself, I guess, and say that I don't intend to say that Django is useless or terrible or that it does nothing and will ruin your life. The point is that most people who choose Django for technical (not social like ""we all already know django"") reasons are making an incorrect choice. For now ""we all already know django"" is acceptable, just like ""well we all already know SVN"" was, but at some point it won't cut it anymore, and you'll be expected to adapt.<p>>Django is batteries included. Pyramid is not.<p>I disagree. Pyramid comes with batteries. It has a full stack ready to go for you if you just want to open it up and code, just like Django does. The difference is that Pyramid allows you to tweak or swap freely as necessary, and Django makes it difficult.<p>>It's flat out wrong to make a blanket statement like yours.<p>No, it isn't. My blanket statement is generally but not all inclusive. Is it wrong to say ""Using Windows 2000 as the primary hosting platform for new projects is almost always wrong""? Things change in tech. Rigid generic frameworks that try to dictate templaters and ORMs are old hat, they are plainly incorrect for all but the most esoteric use cases. There is no good reason to do this.<p>Is Django going to disappear overnight? No, but I hope that people can get past their holy wars and take a serious objective analysis. Consider that you're actually against a useful feature set just because the less-powerful solution is often ""good enough"". That's not a reason to choose a thing, it's just a reason not to flee from a thing. I'm not saying every Django app needs to be rewritten, but I do think it's silly to settle on ""good enough"" for new stuff when ""much better"" is available at little or no downside.",1361953085

Le me explain you: cancer is <i>one big thing</i>, the biggest imho, that prevents advances in areas like genetic therapies and lots of areas of what we call regenerative medicine (because, to put it in simpler terms, nobody will research a therapy that will make you live longer but has 10% chances of giving you a killer cancer - that will mean that statistically, the therapy will <i>not</i> make you live longer). At the same time, understanding cellular regulation at the level needed to actually solve cancer is the same type of understanding needed to slow aging, regenerate organs etc.. Imagine cancer as the dragon guarding the ""fountain of youth"": once you kill it, sooner or later someone will figure out a way to get to it and use it's water. <i>Everyone wants it killed!</i> After solving cancer, with heart disease remaining the main killer in the developing world, all resources could be dedicated to ""growing hearts"" for example, or ""repairing clogged vessels"" and these problems will be solved sooner or later because, at a level, they are actually <i>engineering problems</i>, they don't really require that much new science to solve, just tons of data about cellular regulatory pathways and such - and we'll already have lots of it from the cancer research.<p>Yeah, the medical professionals or researchers like to keep their feet on the ground and not talk about such ""lofty"" scify-like ideas - but everybody with some understanding of science and medicine knows things are along these lines...<p>TL;DR ""Solving cancer"" is not only about cancer - it's about <i>immor-fucking-tality!</i> (and everyone wants this!)",1361952953

First class functions lead to some neat tricks, and aside from a few minor quirks (scoping issues, overloading the ""+"" operator) it lacks nasty gotchas like Java and PHP, at least so far.<p>3) Lots of programmers have JS experience and web experience, so there's a large potential pool of users (Subjectively, this may or may not be a good thing, see PHP. But there's demand)<p>It's probably not the be-all-end-all, but there are some positive reasons to see work in this space. I'm curious to see how the language implementations evolve as people start doing more complex server side things with JS.",1267815595

The difference lies in Congress’s stated determination to investigate, usually when there is a suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of public officials acting in their official capacity, or private citizens whose activities suggest the need for a legislative remedy. Congress’s authority to investigate is broad and it has exercised this authority since the earliest days of the republic. Its most famous inquiries are benchmarks in American history: Credit Mobilier, Teapot Dome, Army-McCarthy, Watergate, and Iran-Contra. Investigative hearings often lead to legislation to address the problems uncovered. Judicial activities in the same area of Congress’s investigation may precede, run simultaneously with, or follow such inquiries.</i><p>It's not a recent phenomenon at all.  For example, the Crédit Mobilier hearings were in 1872.",1267815543

Perhaps the investment in these technologies, and the resulting loss in customer goodwill, are costing more than the actual piracy.<p>Maybe the vast cinematography, scoring, voice acting, etc., aren't what gamers really want, and the ""big budget"" games are really throwing away money.

1170132,comment,1169541,1169541,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"Reasonable concerns, but most apply to print books as well.<p>Reputation is reputation, whether it's a publishing house or a sole author.   I've bought crappy books from reputable publishers (O'Reilly had  a book on VBScript that was total crap, for example), so you still have to do some checking to see if a book is really going to be worth your time and money.   For most technical data it seems a bit of time on Google should tell you if the author knows his or her stuff.<p>A more reasonable concern is copy editing.  While publishers may no longer be vetting the technical aspects well as they should (The book RESTful Web Services, for example, has assorted (mostly minor) technical errors) the overall editing quality tends to be good.  I have less faith in sole author/editor/publisher set-ups to have proper grammar and consistent use of the author's voice, for example.<p>OTOH, most E-books tend to be cheaper than printed books, and are often bought to expedite some development process.  If I can save myself an hour two of research and dead-ends while working on a paid contract, then I've easily saved  myself many times the cost of the book.<p>Finally, printed books go on sale, too, or end up in the discount bin, so while it's not the same as finding out you could have gotten something for free, it's close.<p>The value of technical info depends on how timely it is; these are perishable goods with a limited shelf life. You want it fresh, you gots to pay more.<p>One annoyance with E-books that wasn't mentioned was the lack of appropriate screen formatting.  I have some PDFs from Pragmatic Press, for example, and they are all laid out for the printed page, not for my laptop screen.  Nothing flows; I have to deal with hard page breaks as if I were dealing with paper.",1267815111

We've got 800,000+ registered users and over 50 million user-generated flash cards on the site.<p>Just wanted to share with HN a cool story...<p>We have an API that lets developers create apps that search and download from our big flashcard database so our students can study in new ways and when on-the-go through mobile apps.<p>One of our favorite iPhone Apps using the Quizlet API was Agilis Lab's Flashcard Touch ( http://www.agilislab.com/ ).  It was a simple but beautiful implementation.<p>For the month of March, we decided to heavily promote their (previously $2.99) app if they'd make it free for the month.  The app had only been getting a relatively small number of downloads and had ~16 reviews on Feb 28th.  After only a few days of the promotion, the results have overwhelming:<p>- Day 1: it hit #2 free app in the Education category of the App Store and had 5,000 downloads<p>- Day 2: it hit #1 free app in Education category and made #94 in overall free apps<p>- Day 3: hit #40 in top free apps overall, then 33, and kept climbing<p>- Day 4: hit #15 in top free apps, (on the coveted Top 25 page), surpassing the Facebook app in the process. now has almost 500 reviews.<p>Of course the big question is how their app will do once the initial popularity fades and when it's no longer free, but it sure is fun seeing so many people get to try out the app and get exposed to Quizlet.<p>We'd really love to see other API developers do even more with Quizlet. We'll be releasing 2.0 of our API soon which will include the ability to get authenticate, get private sets, and even upload flashcards. http://quizlet.com/faqs/the-quizlet-flashcards-api/",1267814953

1170112,comment,1169830,1170068,0,0,cryptnoob,,,"This is more believable to me, as the ""set-point"" for cruise control is not dependent  upon throttle position, but instead, is remembered by the computer.  There's nothing to check against to insure believability.<p>More suspect, in my opinion, is that in a cruise control, you have a feedback system, based on car speed.  The car speed is almost certainly redundantly sensed, so that's no worries, but the feedback loop itself could potentially go oscillatory if there were other variables introduced that hadn't been designed for.  Those variables could be pretty subtle.  For example, maybe the gear motor that you use to mechanically control the engine gets sourced from another distributor, and they give you a better one, that has more torque.  Perhaps that throws off the stability analysis that you had done.  Tons of things could change somewhere between the 500K's car and 1M's car you produced, lots of different vendors and permutations could come into play that could throw off the stability of a cruise control, I would think.<p>EDIT: They're probably using feedback in the control motors as well (servos), so that's a non-realistic example, but it illustrates the problem.",1267814928

It works like this, a touch is only valid if you presented your intent to attack and thus gained right of way.  It is a very subtle thing, but it has a very important implications for the sport.<p>It exists because the first person to score a touch gets the point.  If right-of-way didn't exist then the right thing to do when your opponent goes for your head would be to poke him very quickly on the arm or torso and just take the blow to the head.  If you hit him first, it would be your point.  This is pretty silly though and would be an artifact of the stylization of fencing.  No rational person would opt to get a small cut on the opponents arm or chest in exchange for a large gash on their head.<p>In a bloody duel, 90% of your energy needs to be focused on not getting hit.  It would be a hollow victory if you got yourself just as cut up as your opponent.<p>This was always a problem when fencing with new fencers.  They didn't understand the right of way and didn't know how to read your actions, so it was very easy to go for a blow and get slapped on the side for it.  I'd get the point for having right of way, and I'd have to explain what a silly move it was.  Yes, they hit me first, but they still got hit.<p>It's even harder to parry a knife than a sword.

If they don't match within 5%, you power down.<p>You also toggle bits in your code.  One in the main loop, another in any interrupt service routine that you are dependent upon.  These bits then go to a GPIO so that the GPIO toggles.  If the ISR freezes or the main loop freezes, the GPIO quits toggling.  You then have an hardware, RC-Diode type circuit, that stays high if it's input toggles, but goes low, if it's input goes low and stays low, or goes high and stays high.  The output of this circuit drives a relay, so that if the CPU quits toggling the GPIO, the relay clicks off.  The output of that relay is a dead-man's switch that powers down the vehicle.  The end result is a hardware fail-safe if the CPU misbehaves.  There are other tests to confirm that the relay isn't frozen, that the RC-Diode circuit isn't frozen, etc.<p>So, in theory, if a high-school sophomore designed the vehicle, you might have a problem.

You may think that those two words have no meaning, but to many people they say a lot.  Most people are not literal.  Their words are loaded with additional layers of meaning.<p>For example, ""I think the world was created 6k years ago,"" is a very non-threatening statement.  It's just an opinion and by stating that it's just your thought, you imply that it's okay that others think differently.  If you had said, ""The world was created 6k years ago,"" you are stating a fact and inviting disagreement.<p>It is not about differentiating fact from opinion, but rather not understanding what implications you words have.  ""Sometimes what wasn't said is more important than what was said.""

Finding a team of people with a blend of skills that complement each other, is the holy grail in my opinion.<p>Two print designers, come web designers I have worked with have both been excellent contributers to web projects. One heavily focuses on the look and feel, html and css. The other is gifted in the looks department and is a competent programmer.  It took them both a while for them to get the hang of a new medium, but they love it. It does take a while for print designers to understand the elasticity of a web page, some find it hard to relinquish pixel perfection.<p>I can realise a site design from paper based mockups, bitmaps and vectors. I'd struggle to create a visual design myself but can work with an artist that understands 'web design' principles.<p>While it may be a nice idea to create 'out of the box' designs, you are still bound to your medium.  Understanding that medium's strengths, weaknesses and conventions is very important.<p>So I'd like to emphasise the point again, that a mult-disiplined team can all contribute something good to a site.

Over a decade, that's about one in 800. Given the millions of cars included in the Toyota recalls and the fewer than 20 alleged deaths over the past decade, the alleged fatality rate is about one death per 200,000 recalled Toyotas. Even if all the alleged deaths really are resultant from vehicle defects—highly unlikely—and even if all the worst things people are speculating about Toyotas are true, and you're driving one, and you aren't smart or calm enough to shift to neutral if the thing surges, you're still approximately 250 times likelier to die in one of these cars for reasons having nothing to do with unintended acceleration.

People who espouse free market views of health insurance believe that it can work like other insurances (such as car and home insurance). But this ignores the fact that health insurance is fundamentally different. With other types of insurance, the max value of the insured is fixed (to basically its replacement cost). However, since we can't replace ourselves, we have to resort to fixing the problem with medicine, and the cost of this is dependent on the type and severity of the illness. The free market approach is exactly what you see with today's dysfunctional system. Health insurance companies charge healthy people and drop them when they get sick. Or healthy people decide not to insure themselves, and so the rolls are left with sick people who have higher insurance premiums. Of course, sometimes the healthy people get sick, go to the ER, and raise everybody's costs.<p>Health insurance companies would love to purge their rolls of all unhealthy people, and only charge premiums to healthy people.

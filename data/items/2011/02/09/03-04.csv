2196205,comment,2195409,2195826,0,0,sfraser,,,"Thanks... my experience with clojure on the JVM is it is in general slower than optimally tuned Java code. I really can't imagine that any of the other languages you listed would easily outperform the code I have here, but maybe since the use-case is a sweet spot for functional? The person who responded to me with the F# example reported a crazy low time, and I am wondering if they have a defect in the code. I think it is possible a true functional language could make some tweaks that Java can't (like realizing the function is idempotent and caching the response instead of recalculating it). Maybe that is why the F# example was so quick - either the way it times itself is defective, or perhaps the runtime memoizes the function.<p>My experience with all the languages in your sampler is that their runtime performance usually lags the Java on the JVM for general purpose programming. This is not an argument not to use them - I would prefer many of them in certain use cases. But if I want a managed runtime, and have some performance critical code that I am OK with being written in an imperative language, it is hard to beat the performance of simple Java on the JVM. There has been so much tuning to Hotspot over the last decade. That's been my experience anyways.",1297223477

At ~300 words, it cost on the order of $6~8 to write.  In <i>January alone</i>, it generated about $1.30 in DM's cut of my $2 AdWords spend.  It will do four times that or more in February.  Count the other advertisers on the page and I would be <i>astonished</i> if it pulls in less than $20 ~ $25 of revenue this year.  This model empirically scales to the freaking moon.<p>I also checked my stats for how much I'm subsidizing Mahalo.  Turns out: not that much!  ($20 in four years.) The reason appears to be that, at least as it relates to educational bingo cards, DM convincingly clobbers Mahalo on execution.<p><a href=""http://www.mahalo.com/christmas-bingo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mahalo.com/christmas-bingo/</a>  <-- <i>Winces.</i>  30 words of content and half of them are an inducement to click on ads!<p>Yeah, if I were Mahalo, I wouldn't want to compete against DM using DM's model either.  They're just better at farming.  I am skeptical that the new model will work except as PR cover for the old model: i.e. handcrafted pillar content provides enough plausible deniability to hope Google does not mass purge all thin mahalo.com/* pages from the Internet.  The economics of $1,000+ a page pillar content makes sense if (and probably only if) the pillar content preserves thousands of cheaper pages.<p>So much the better for Mahalo if they can simultaneously get an effective competitor of those filler pages torched.",1297221106

Understanding this is what separates a seasoned pro from someone throwing out trollbait comments about XML and assembly instructions.<p>First off, the resolution of TickCount is not less than 500 milliseconds. Are you sure you are actually timing it right? Maybe you should have used DateTime.Ticks which has a higher resolution. (seriously - I think you need to check your code)<p>But in any case, let's say your test is actually valid. You mentioned ""Java line noise"" - not really a real explanation for the difference.<p>So let me guess for you -  maybe your F# runtime knows the function is pure and idempotent, and after running it once it probably just cached the output. So your run doesn't actually execute the filter across the list for every iteration, whereas my Java code did.<p>I could rewrite my Java code to return the same array over and over after it has been computed once, but it sure won't look as clean as a functional language like F#. I grant you that, and that's one of the reasons I prefer functional languages to Java.<p>Next time maybe put a little more thought into the response if you actually really have no idea why your program said ""0.014100 milliseconds"".",1297220683

I traveled to 5 or 6 countries, met tons of great people (and a heck of a lot of assholes - they're even more fun), drank myself silly quite frequently, and played Rugby with schools from around the world, sometimes while drinking. No matter what they say on hacker news, a good MBA is a solid education at a very rapid pace if you want it to be.<p>The catch is that it was way cheaper when I went, which wasn't that long ago ('05 grad). Paying the $40-60k/year that the top schools charge today is on the border of being reckless. You had better have it worked out financially, and I don't mean ""I'll get a cushy MBA job that pays $150k/year and pay it off in 9 months"", because that is a fantasy for most people. You never wind up making what you expect to, and there's always some lifestyle creep that keeps you from paying it off as fast as you wanted to.<p>But yeah, it's worth it.

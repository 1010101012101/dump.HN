Teams have to pay star players lots of money, even if they later do badly; publishers give big advances to famous writers, and sometimes their books flop.  It's just the way the world works, not some specially sinister thing about CEOs.",1182221548

Domains like imin.lv ha!<p>How would a foreign extension affect user search results? Would you show up in a US search if you're under .es?",1182221317

29079,comment,28703,28828,0,0,rms,,,"I of course recognize that capitalism is all we have. It still pains me that politics in the USA are corrupted by corporations and that a billion people live in absolute poverty. Still, the average standard of living is higher now than it's ever been.<p>I just can't get past this feeling that there's something horribly wrong with our society... from pharmaceutical companies keeping AIDS medication locked away to an invasion of the Middle East to take their energy. This can all be explained through rational self-interest but it's pretty horrific to contemplate. Is there a better way? Will we ever achieve real Globalization?<p>Can and will global poverty be solved before humanity achieves a post-scarcity economy?",1182220814

This is no accident, but has to do with clever things like Thrift (go google it). Also, I remember the current CTO of Facebook as being extremely smart even by the standards of the good CS school we both attended.",1182220200
29075,comment,28830,29066,0,0,pg,,,"I think anyone who is a general-purpose journalist rather than a domain expert is going to have this problem.  Journalists don't actually understand the stuff they write about; no one could, probably; so instead they have a lot of hacks for sounding like they know what they're talking about.<p>Come to think of it, though, domain experts are often wrong too.  Think about programming books, for example.  I've now learned enough about several other fields to be fairly sure this problem is universal, except possibly in math. (Though even mathematicians have often been wrong in the sense of overlooking something that to later generations will seem obvious.)<p>Basically, you have to be a very critical reader.  I doubt there's a ""solution"" beyond that.  This is something the very smartest people struggle all their lives to get better at-- to take in all the stuff they're told, and from that figure out what's really going on.  ",1182220041

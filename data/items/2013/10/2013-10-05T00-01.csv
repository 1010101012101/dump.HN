6498962,comment,6496797,6496797,3,0,jrockway,,,"It really depends on what team you&#x27;re on.  When I worked at a bank, I worked on a pretty competent team.  We didn&#x27;t do anything that important, but it did work pretty well... we had automated tests, continuous builds, and all that good stuff.  Most people could open up someone else&#x27;s code and work on it.  (This was largely due to the efforts of one engineer on the team, but you have to give credit to the management for letting him do it :)<p>At the same time, I would work with other teams, and it just amazed me the kinds of problems they caused.  One team worked on streaming data from spreadsheets to other spreadsheets.  (Don&#x27;t ask me why all market data was calculated using spreadsheets.)  This was implemented as a set of servers that read from and wrote to a proprietary multicast network that was usually down.  It didn&#x27;t matter, though, because the servers themselves &quot;health checked&quot; each other, and if it detected one was responding too slowly, it would kill and restart it.  Except sometimes the killing and restarting caused <i>that</i> server to fail to respond to health checks, so the system basically consisted of servers killing each other all the time.  (No, it didn&#x27;t actually work despite all this.  It was a constant source of problems, and was over a million lines of C++!  It couldn&#x27;t even quit without core-dumping because of memory corruption!)<p>Another team I worked with wrote their application on Java.  The company had a policy of only allowing developers to develop on Windows machines, but this team needed to deploy to Solaris.  Their solution was to develop and test it on Windows, copy it to the Solaris machines on launch day, and turn it on.  But a Windows-only library crept into the core.  If this were rocket science, we would not have gone to space that day.<p>But, there were some pretty good initiatives.  One was for a single team to rewrite all software at the bank, in their own C++/C#/Python hybrid, with their own IDE, making all other software engineers obsolete.  And despite how crazy that sounds, they actually did a good job!  They gave every obscure system at the company a unified API, so a normal user could stitch it all together with a tiny Python program.  And write tests for it.  It was rough around the edges while I was there, but obviously the way forward.  (The big advantage: middle managers had no control over technology, only making a product.  So there were no debates ... or rather, horrifyingly bad decisions ... over what servers to buy, what language to use, who would pay for the sysadmins... all they needed to do was design and implement.  It was brilliant, and I wish them the best of luck.)",1380934694

If enough people the world over does this, we would make it a lot harder for a global passive attacker to succeed.<p>Tor&#x27;s biggest vulnerability is the risk associated with operating exit nodes means that the number of exit nodes remains relatively low at ~1000 worldwide. If hundreds of thousands of exit nodes started popping up all over the globe. It would be very hard to counter.<p>I&#x27;m also curious if enough governments unhappy with what is happening could go as far as hosting many tor nodes outside the control of the NSA. Is the Global Passive Adversary threat still valid if there are many of them that are non-cooperative with one another (i.e. China can&#x27;t monitor US and Russian tor nodes, Russia can&#x27;t monitor US and Chinese nodes, and the US can&#x27;t monitor Chinese and Russian nodes)?

They could be different divisions in a company, or different racks in a data-center.  They can be any grouping where you might want different policies applied.  You can also use BGP between devices in the same AS where a common policy makes sense.  There&#x27;s no technical limitation stopping you from using BGP inside the data-center, so it comes down to pros and cons of the various options out there.<p>Our main goals were scalability, reliability and simplicity.  When it comes to scalability BGP is essentially the best, this is because, and why it&#x27;s used between AS&#x27;s where the routing tables can grow quite large.  When it comes to reliability, we previously had a layer2 architecture, but there are a lot of challenges with that at scale, some examples:<p>* Split brain: In a layer2 world, you still typically have a layer3 protocol running between your upper layers.  We were using BGP and VRRP at the time, and issues in one wouldn&#x27;t always be communicated to the other, in some cases that&#x27;s not possible. So VRRP may think everything is fine, while BGP is down, the result is black-holed trafic.<p>* Scale: Running an all layer2 network requires devices that have large enough CAM tables to support all connected devices, many vendors newer full line rate cards were coming out with smaller CAM tables, as such layer2 simply wasn&#x27;t an option in some cases.  Additionally, many of the other protocols that were options are computationally expensive to deploy at a large size, you either end up slowing them down, or deploying relatively complex designs.<p>One of the many significant benefits BGP brought us came in the form of ECMP.  In a layer2/VRRP world, balancing traffic is hacky with two destinations, if you want to do more, which we did, it becomes increasingly complex.  With BGP it&#x27;s built in, we can consistently and easily balance the load to 8, 16, 32 or more destinations depending
on the hardware and software in use.<p>BGP is also readily available in the software from the major network vendors, as well as within OpenSource solutions for the servers.  This means we can use a common protocol everywhere.  Which in turns makes sourcing and deploying new equipment much easier and simplifies the configs, policies and tooling needed to support the deployment.<p>There are many other reasons that layer2 wasn&#x27;t a good choice for us, and that layer3 makes a lot of sense.  I&#x27;d be happy to discuss more of these as well.<p>Hopefully this helps to answer your question.",1380931946

 ---
 It&#x27;s unstated from when the investigation started, but they received a complete copy of the Silk Road web server on the 23rd of July 2013. This was all done under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which implies that they had access to current site information up until the point they shut the site down.
 This included user account and transaction information. It&#x27;s unclear whether or not this covers addresses and other sensitive transaction information.
 <i></i>This also apparently covers at least 60 days worth of messages from the period where the site was copied.
 From February 6, 2011 to July 23 2013, 9,519,664BTC was generated in sales, 614,305BTC going directly to DPR in the way of &quot;commissions&quot;. This comes to a total of 1,229,465 transactions.
 Based on the copy of the site which the FBI received, they believe DPR to have been the sole operator and owner of SR, handling all aspects of the site himself and delegating only user affairs to appointed moderators.
 ---
 In March of this year, a SR user/vendor called &quot;FriendlyChemist&quot; attempted to extort DPR via SR&#x27;s private message system, providing proof that he had the names/addresses of thousands of vendors/users after having allegedly hacked a bigger vendor. He demanded $500,000USD, saying that he needed the money to pay off his supplier. DPR then stated that he wished to speak to FriendlyChemist&#x27;s supplier.
 A user called &quot;redandwhite&quot; then proceeded to contact DPR, stating that he was FriendlyChemist&#x27;s supplier and also the owner of his debt. DPR then solicited redandwhite to &quot;execute&quot; FriendlyChemist, supplying redandwhite his full name and address. After having agreed on terms, DPR sent redandwhite approximately $150,000USD (1,670BTC) to have FriendlyChemist killed. redandwhite later provided photographic proof of the alleged murder.
 Investigators could not find any record of somebody in that region being killed around that date or matching that description. This possibly implies that DPR was duped/scammed, but, DPR is also quoted as having told redandwhite the following: &quot;Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for 80k.&quot;

 DPR has been identified as Ross William Ulbricht.
 > &quot;He is 29 years old, graduated from the University of Texas with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 2006. From 2006 to 2010, he attended graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania School of Materials Science and Engineering.&quot;
 His LinkedIn profile is at: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossulbricht"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossulbricht</a>
Now, onto how he got caught...
 An agent involved in the investigation (&quot;Agent-1&quot;), found the first few references to SR on the internet from somebody only identified as &quot;altoid&quot;, attempting to promote the site in its beginning days, in January of 2011.
 In October of the same year, a user also going by the name of &quot;altoid&quot; made a posting on Bitcoin Talk titled &quot;a venture backed Bitcoin startup company&quot;, which directed interested users to &quot;rossulbricht at gmail dot com&quot;.
 That email address is what led to DPR&#x27;s downfall.
 ---
 After identifying &quot;altoid&quot;, they started connecting the &quot;DPR&quot; identity to Ulbricht pretty quickly.
 Ulbricht&#x27;s Google+ page and YouTube profile both make multiple references to the a website dubbed the &quot;Mises Institute&quot;. DPR&#x27;s signature on the SR forums contained a link to the Mises Institute.
 DPR cited the &quot;Austrian Economic theory&quot; along with the works of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard, all of which are closesly associated with the Mises Institute.
 Server logs show that someone logged onto the SR administration panel from San Fransisco around the same time that Ulbricht was staying in San Fransisco.
 Multiple fake IDs were intercepted by U.S. Customs & Border Patrol while on their way to an address which Ulbricht was living at the time. These IDs all carried photos of Ulbricht but had false names and details. This was around the same time that DPR stated in a message that he was acquiring some fake IDs to buy new servers.
 When questioned by Homeland Security about the fake IDs, he refused to answer any questions but then stated that anyone could purchase such things using &quot;Silk Road&quot; and &quot;Tor&quot;.
 The address which Ulbricht was staying at was being rented in cash and he was living with housemates who knew him under a name which corresponded with one of the fake IDs.
 He posted on StackOverflow using his real name, inquiring about how to use curl/PHP to grab things off Tor, before quickly changing the name to &quot;frosty&quot; (with a fake email: frosty@frosty.com)
Second murder conspiracy allegation
 A superseding indictment was filed in federal court in Maryland less than a day after Ulbricht was initially arrested and charged. This details DPR attempting to have somebody tortured and murdered for $80,000.
 This is likely the incident which he referenced when speaking to &quot;redandwhite&quot; about having &quot;FriendlyChemist&quot; killed.
 He has been indicted in Maryland for charges stemming from these allegations of murder for hire.
 The charges are as follows: Attempted Witness Murder (carries a maximum sentence of 30 years), Use of Interstate Commerce Facilities in Commission of Murder-for-Hire (carries a maximum sentence of 10 years), Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance (carries a possible sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment) and Aiding & Abetting (carries a matching sentence of the crime which the accused aided and abetted with).
 It is alleged that in February of this year, undercover agents approached DPR claiming to want to sell large amounts of cocaine, with DPR acting as a middle-man to facilitate the finding of a buyer for the drugs.
 One of DPR&#x27;s &quot;employees&quot; then agreed to receive the drugs and was then apprehended by police upon receiving a package which he believed to be a kilo of cocaine.
 This employee then allegedly stole money from some SR users and went missing, which led DPR to believe that he might talk to the police.
 DPR then solicited the undercover agents to have the employee tortured to give the stolen Bitcoins back.
 A day later, DPR changed his mind and requested that they kill him after torturing him, stating that he&quot;was on the inside for a while, and now that he&#x27;s been arrested, I&#x27;m afraid he&#x27;ll give up info.&quot;
 They agreed on a price of $80,000 for the torturing and murder of the employee, with $40,000 paid in advance and $40,000 paid on proof of completion.
 DPR then sent $40,000 from Technocash Limited to a bank account at the Capitol One Bank in Washington D.C.
 The undercover agents provided DPR with photos of the employee being tortured, then finally, dead.
 DPR then sent another $40,000 using the same method.",1380931696

We would never do it, not for any amount of money.<p>First of all, he has no control how the raw files will be processed, so if your post processing is poor then someone else asks who shot your wedding, you&#x27;ll reply with his name. Don&#x27;t forget you&#x27;ve got the ability to change the end result of his work with raw files and with that goes his reputation.<p>Additionally the raw files aren&#x27;t always great straight out of the camera, great pictures emerge after cropping, straightening and balancing the entire image. His perceived skill will be greatly reduced when you see unedited images that are in need of work.<p>You are paying for his all-round skills to deliver great images not for someone to press the shutter & deliver raw files.<p>It&#x27;s the equivalent of asking an artist for his practise sketches & tubes of paint or asking a chef for the raw ingredients, cooking whatever you want with them and the chef still having his name attached to the quality of dish that you create. He may have intended to create a souffl but you may end up creating scrambled eggs and there&#x27;s nothing he can do about it.<p>Personally we find that images at 300dpi are optimised for prints (12x8) we scale our print files around 3600 x 2400 pixels. This is around 8 to 9 megapixels. We also provide low-res files too for sharing on Facebook, e-mailing etc.<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s some misunderstanding between file size (2.5 megabytes) and 2.5 megapixels - that&#x27;s more of a sensor size e.g iPhone equivalent.<p>If you do get raw files, then please prepare them for print correctly, image labs won&#x27;t accept them at that size.<p>Instead of asking for raw files, just ask for a larger size jpg and specify 3600 x 2400 pixels for your high res files, that should make it clear what you want and it protects his work too.",1371077616

It would seem that the overall task or project that a person is using the computer for in a particular moment is important but there is no modern OS (that I know of) that keeps track of this context.<p>Such a system might be a sort of metadata API for tasks or projects.  The system would have a built in task tracking application that would interface with this API. (Which could be pluggable) The metadata for a task could hold a lot of information.  For example a default directory where files for the task are stored could be created when the task is created.  Other applications like a word processor could query the API to find out where to store its files.  Web browsers could store what pages a user looks at for a task.  E-Mail clients could offer the current task as a folder to store messages in.  When the user switches tasks the currently open applications would be messaged and could open files the user had open when they were perviously working on that task. Finally when a user marks a task as completed all the files and messages related to that task could be archived together.<p>For the novice user of this system things like the file system go away. Their view is the projects that they are currently working on.  The file system will still be there under the covers but user doesn&#x27;t need to see it.

Many of our laws are designed to prevent us from doing worse things.<p>Imagine driving on a residential street at 60 mph. That in and of itself is not a problem (other than noise), but hitting something at that speed most certainly is, especially in a neighborhood. Likewise, drunk driving is not a problem until you hit someone or crash yourself. Not coming to a complete stop at a 4-way stop sign. (all traffic examples, sorry)<p>Those traffic behaviors are not destructive, until something goes wrong. So if we reduce the law count but increase penalties, we&#x27;re on the right track. For instance, if we really want to stop the effects of drunk driving, we have 30 days jail time for the first offense.<p>I think that if we had the proper (minimum) set of laws, then we should have no problem with 100% enforcement.<p>Now, on the issue of privacy, actually achieving 100% enforcement would be impossible without a complete surveillance state (or zero laws, but this is the trivial case).<p>We do have the power to change the direction of this country, and the author of the article points to gay marriage and pot use to champion this idea of liberty. But the author also points at the sheer scope of federal law as a huge problem. If the government has a problem with you, they can (probably) put you behind bars -- and this is a problem indeed.<p>So how should you vote? Vote for candidates who want to reduce the burden of government on the people and enhance personal freedom. I contend that gay marriage wouldn&#x27;t even be an issue if the government weren&#x27;t involved in marriage in the first place (and it shouldn&#x27;t be). The Left loves tearing down the moral codes of previous generations, claiming bigotry, homophobia, etc., but it also loves to build up government in a huge way. The Republicans, unfortunately, have lost the way of small government, but I believe they are a better hope than the Dems, in the long run.",1371076456

So it&#x27;s not so much an external agent responding to our behavior as our behavior being poorly though out.
Also, these problems does not necessarily only affect us; some of them might result in irreparable damage to the ecosystem.<p>Pedantry aside, factors that contribute to Terra&#x27;s apparent lack of long term sustainability are easy to spot, and there are plenty of options to try before having to resort to birth limits, euthanasia etc.<p>Insufficient reproductive education, lack of birth control, local scarcity through international inequality (i.e. exploitation), patterns of use and consumption, low food production efficiency, pollution from energy usage (non-alternative forms) and population density/distribution are all things that can be altered, upon which the constraints of viability rests.<p>Of course, none of these would be particularly easy to change, but I suspect many of us would find attempting to do so preferable to the alternatives.",1417363100

It can frequently optimize away stuff like NaN checks and the like, breaking code that uses NaN as a missing value. This, specifically, has bitten me before, but there are certainly other areas that it can bite you.<p>OTOH it gives the compiler to do a great deal of algebraic simplifications, including expression reordering. This probably will bring what the compiler can actually do more in line with what you think it should be able to do.<p>Basically, you <i>need</i> to test with it on if you&#x27;re going to use `-ffast-math`. You might also have good luck with turning on a subset of the flags. For example, IIRC in the project with the NaN checks, using all of them except `-ffinite-math-only` fixed the problem in this case.<p>Some of them are obvious to turn on though. `-fno-math-errno` should be the default for most programs, if you ask me.

>Buddhism is nontheistic, so no contradiction...<p>Buddhist friend from Japan claims otherwise. Many Gods in Buddhism. Taking the religion and cutting out whatever not convenient so Westerners will still pay for the privilege. That&#x27;s what they did to promote buddhism in US and make money on it. Still it is like puzzle with missing pieces then.<p>You know Jesuits (yep, these evil dudes) have their own ways to meditate, their own way look on things like economics (gold standard has been widely discussed among Jesuits since middle ages), etc. One could take whatever is convenient there too, say there is no God, and just end up with some kind of philosophy. My point is that it&#x27;s not like in your own civilization you don&#x27;t have some deep thoughts or ways to meditate, it is just that they aren&#x27;t fashionable at the moment. Or maybe christians are too focused on Jesus Christ to notice all this stuff that was developed within this religion across centuries.<p>>> You probably would be better off omitting this spiritual junk food of new age instead altogether.
>In favour of what?<p>Something closer to our own civilization. I think I believe in God. I go to church very rarely though. I&#x27;m not deep believer. I hate all the bad things Catholic Church has been doing. Especially to children. But Im not obsessed with them too. I&#x27;m not a good Catholic at all. But for me changing this altogether to be more Eastern would be a mistake. You are still under influence of a religious thought. The difference is that it is foreign to the culture where you function daily. It&#x27;s like changing big comfortable armchair for a wooden chair.  Maybe you don&#x27;t want to sit at home at all, but still better to have an armchair.<p>When I was a child (maybe 8 year old) I was slapped in face by a priest during mess. Others, friends saw it. It was because I wanted to leave the mess. Because I was feeling really bad/dizzy. The point to understand is that this priest is a really, really bad christian. He isn&#x27;t God.<p>If you want to pick and choose. At least do it within your culture. Pick and choose values in your own culture that make sense to you.<p>Omit these bad Christians who hurt you. I&#x27;m sure there are bad buddhist monks who hurt their own too. See through that. Might be intellectually interesting.<p>Gold Standard and Jesuits: they figured out that fiat money always ends up with inflation (stealing the value of money by the King/Government). So they figured gold standard is good as it makes stealing money from people more difficult. Now, just imagine the parallel between this and for example what many modern economists say. They might not even know that a lot of libertarian economic thought had its roots in Jesuits &quot;philosophy&quot;. Religion touches every aspect of our lives. Should FED be abolished? There were guys in habits thinking about it 500 years ago. Just saying it is cool to see these parallels within your culture. If I studied buddhism instead I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see them. Not sure if bddhism has anything on money standards or economics.<p>But again, I write this, and will go to church rarely. Christianity is just important part of our culture. It is school of thought too. But instead of insulating you from the world (i.e. issues, economy, whatever), it is strongly embedded in it. It actually defined our culture whether we like it or not.  For Jesus Christ we have Marxist priests. How they connect the two, I don&#x27;t know, but shows you how deep some of these philosophies can be, even though we are not aware of them.",1417362073

I think that&#x27;s a fairly reasonable position to take given that the confidence in the safety of the vaccine is high, and that even if the health care workers were given the vaccine, they should be following the same decontamination/personal protection protocols anyways (for person health reasons - no vaccine is 100% perfect and for public health reasons - it minimizes cross infection).<p>In addition, it is possible to do accelerated Phase 2/3 in Africa. This is also a compromise position. In this scheme, they would likely dispense a few thousand vaccines in a relatively highly developed, but still high risk area to aid in their ability to track efficacy. From the NIH FAQ on Ebola vaccines (<a href=""http://www.niaid.nih.gov/news/QA/Pages/EbolaVaxResultsQA.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/news/QA/Pages/EbolaVaxResultsQA.asp...</a>)<p><pre><code>  Given the encouraging results of the bivalent version of the NIAID/GSK experimental Ebola vaccine at the NIH Clinical Center, are there plans for Phase 2/3 clinical trials in West Africa?

  NIAID is in active discussions with Liberian officials and other partners about next-stage vaccine testing in West Africa. The goal of these studies would be to test efficacy and safety of the NIAID/GSK vaccine compared to other Ebola vaccine candidates prior to wider vaccine distribution. Phase 2/3 clinical trials are designed to inform efficacy—whether or not the vaccine works—and provide additional critical safety data. Plans for such studies are dependent on additional safety and immunogenicity data derived from the currently ongoing clinical trials. Announcements about larger-scale testing will not be made until early 2015. 
</code></pre>
Keep in mind that is basically is impossible to do Phase 2 and 3 testing in North America given the fact that there basically isn&#x27;t any Ebola there at all.",1417361631

So that&#x27;s about $20/hour.<p>Now subtract car payments, insurance, wear and tear, etc.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of how this breaks down:<p>You work 215 hours per month on average (50 * 4.3 weeks) and make $4,300 revenue during that time (or $51,600/year).<p>- Subtract self-employment tax 15.3% - ~$7900<p>- Taxable income 37,650 - ~$5,300 in taxes so subtract that<p>- You put about 70k miles per year on your car assuming an average speed of about 45mph (30 hours * 45mph * 4.3 weeks * 12) - IRS says that&#x27;s $.56 per mile - ~$39k or basically your entire car + a bit more in one year. This includes the cost of gas.<p>- The Prius is about a $23k car, financed completely at 3% for 5 years brings 
you payments to about $400/mo or about $4,800/year<p>So 51,600 - 7,900 - 5,300 - 39,000 - 4,800 = -5,400 ouch<p>Most of your cost is in car wear and tear, so let&#x27;s waive a magic wand and make that go away, it&#x27;s a Toyota after all. But we can&#x27;t get rid of gas costs, so let&#x27;s substitute that in.<p>A prius gets about 51mpg in the city. It looks like I can get gas for about $2.80/gal in San Diego right now. You&#x27;ll need about 1.4k gallons per year. Assuming gas prices stay the same, about $3.8k per year in gas. <i>edit</i> I see I&#x27;m estimating about half the gas pricing you are, so just double my figure here.<p>So 51,600 - 7,900 - 5,300 - 4,800 - 3,800 = $29,800 in take home pay<p><i>edit</i> or $26k take home when using your gas figures which makes it an even $10/hr<p>At your self described work hours of 50hr/wk or 2600hr/year, that&#x27;s $11.50/hr<p>I assume you wash your car and keep it clean because of passengers, so subtract that out also. I&#x27;m going to guess that your take-home pay ends up at around $10/hr if we assume your car takes no wear and tear of any sort driving 70,000 miles a year.<p><i>edit</i> I&#x27;m not even counting commercial car insurance, which I&#x27;m sure you have, or state taxes, inspections, licensing costs, etc. or any other expenses.<p><i>edit</i> Taxi insurance appears to run around $7-10k per year.<p><i>edit</i> so let&#x27;s use the new gas figures, you end up with about $21k take home when you subtract $7k of taxi insurance. Or about $8/hr.<p>Once you deduct state taxes, property taxes etc. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other expenses I&#x27;m missing, I have a feeling your take home pay is about on par with California minimum wage.",1417360673

But things are about to accelerate exponentially on this front: in just the last 6 months we&#x27;ve seen 1) Microsoft engineers get hugely involved in adding Windows support, 2) Joyent &quot;betting the farm&quot; on making Docker a first-class citizen on SmartOS, 3) A big influx of new Linux distros: CoreOS, Boot2docker, Atomic, Ubuntu Core - not to mention the whole schism of traditional distros over &quot;the systemd wars&quot;. 4) more and more unofficial builds of Docker for Arm and Power (not to mention x86_32), being deployed in production today!<p>Meanwhile we are getting the first mergeable patches to move Docker towards fully content-addressable storage and distribution - which once complete will give us the building blocks for real repeatable builds, a-la Nix or Gitian. Yes, fetching external content over the network and executing arbitrary code will always introduce side effects, but with better tooling there are lots of great ways we could manage those side effects. This is one of my favorite areas of the project, and there are lots of awesome ideas and prototypes floating around. Ping me on irc if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing!<p>Obviously there is no silver bullet to make computation more repeatable and portable across a variety of machines and operating systems.. But the community is scratching its own itch, which means it will happen no matter what. There will be plenty of trial and error, but I think we collectively have an opportunity to improve the state of the art. That&#x27;s the beauty of open-source :)<p>And, to state the obvious: the solution is certainly <i>not</i> to pretend that every binary can execute anywhere, unmodified, with the same behavior. Machines and operating systems are heterogeneous, that is a fact. Trying to hide that heterogeneity will not make it go away. Rather, we should embrace it, and define a portable set of commands and properties which have a clear and predictable definition everywhere. Sure, the property &quot;I require a Linux kernel later than 3.8 on x86_64 to start&quot; will not be handled in the same way on every installation of Docker - some may present an error because they are running on another arch. But that property still has a precise and portable definition, and all Docker installations will <i>understand</i> the same thing. Now they can choose to process that property in the most appropriate way: perhaps they will present an informative error message to the user. Perhaps they will look for an &quot;other architectures&quot; field in the image manifest and point the user there. Perhaps they will redirect the request to another host which matches the requirement (hint: that is what Docker Swarm does when it receives a &#x27;docker run&#x27;). With this kind of design we can greatly improve our daily flow as developers and sysops, and we can do it on top of the systems which are installed in the real world, today.",1417359759

Clearly, it&#x27;s possible, and common enough that I have known personally a large number of very highly educated individuals that are YEC, or have similar beliefs (demons, exorcisms, etc.).<p>I do believe there&#x27;s an inverse correlation between education level and intelligence on the one hand, and fundamentalist beliefs on the other. Whether they&#x27;re outliers or not is another question, but I think you might be surprised how many of them there are.",1417359737

When I moved from working from a university to working at a mid-sized corporation, I got roughly a 25% pay bump.  Every single dollar of that went into savings (fully funding the 401(k) and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, etc.).<p>This did a couple of things... it kept a lid on living expenses because there was no additional cash, but it also provided an easy way for me to raise my savings every year without having to make too many conscious choices, just by moving every pay raise into savings.",1417359701

Pattern matching is one of the reasons I love functional programming so much, since combined with algebraic types they can be much more expressive than imperative control-flow statements (e.g. if-else). For programmers that are used to imperative programming, discovering the power of pattern matching can be quite a hurdle.",1417359657

Perhaps she&#x27;s getting a more-frequent dose of the GPS issues than most, or something else, but I think we can take it as given that the median UberX driver -- while not making the $30+/hour that Uber would like you to imagine -- is making comfortably north of $10/hour.

Having some kind of device in the loop is useful as a symbol.  It tells other people that you're listening to music, that you spent a certain amount of money to do so, or that you do or don't pay attention to what's popular.  If you bought a certain color, you probably did so to convey (or to avoid conveying) something about yourself, etc.  People like to carry around and display tokens of their interests.",1244066342

640507,comment,640289,640289,0,0,wglb,,,"Consider the fact that aircraft/control tower conversations are done over AM radio, a very ancient technology as these things go.  Why so old, you might ask, in the vein of your question.  First, there is an infrastructure cost--towers everywhere, airplanes everywhere have AM transmitters and receivers already.<p>Probably the only viable alternative that is still reliable would be single sideband (SSB), but that would be a infrastructure change as well.<p>If you consider what is required to do a digital encoding including handshaking, synchronization and the like, you are less likely to have a less reliable system.  If in the midst of an AM transmission you get a static crash, it likely deletes one word.  In a digital system, you might well have to resync, like a modem.<p>So some of these systems need to be very reliable under all sorts of harsh conditions.  The questions I would ask, is 1) do the satellites already exist 2) how many of them and 3) are they visible everywhere there are airflights? and finally 4) how expensive is this network to maintain?<p>My guess is that the cost of such a network is a lot greater than a few black-box searches.  Additionally, for really difficult crashes, they retrieve every possible piece of the airplane, at an expense that makes finding the black box seem small: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800</a>",1244066049

640478,comment,639571,640088,0,0,akeefer,,,"The real problem is that once you get past very common sorts of things (e-mail, IM, word processing) the needs of different customers start to become different enough that building a single product with no extensibility/customizability becomes incredibly difficult.  For example, say you created a point of sale app:  would that really be suitable for video rental places and for fast food franchises out of the box?  No chance.  If you don't make it extensible, you're guaranteeing the software won't be fit for the very, very specific purpose it needs to be put to.  If you do make it extensible . . . well, writing extensible software is about 10x harder than writing non-extensible software, and as you say it leads to architecture lock-in that makes it hard to innovate in the future.  Plus, the group doing the extensing is probably either in-house IT or outside consultants, neither of which are really going to have the vision/skills/motivation to make something with a truly great user experience.  So by making the software extensible, you're guaranteeing it's not going to be highly polished and that progress on it will be much slower.  But if you don't do that, you're restricted to incredibly small niche markets where people do things similarly enough that you don't need any extensibility (i.e. your market might be about 10 potential customers).  And even then, you have to worry about integration with a gazillion other purpose-built systems, which can still make the user experience suck if they have to switch between 10 different apps, even if one of them is really, really good.<p>'tis a hard problem.",1244064907

Most crashes take place on takeoff or landing.<p>Of the problems that do happen that would take you through a ""jumpable"" altitude, you can only make the jump if you 1) have time, 2) have enough airplane left to jump out of. If a big whole ripped in the plane while in flight at 30k feet, you are very likely already unconscious or dead.<p>There are other issues related to the fact that commercial airliners are not made to be jumped out of at speed. Its difficult or impossible to open their doors during flight (with good reason). Even if you could get them open, there may not be a jump trajectory from some doors that doesn't provide a personal introduction to  wing or engine part.
Also, you cannot jump and live from a plane going 300 knots. The plane would have to decelerate to near stall to make it safe and if its already crashing, maneuvering at the edge of performance is not likely.<p>Also, consider that professional and military jumpers are highly trained, in top physical shape, and the landing sites are carefully chosen to avoid injury. As a fun thought experiment, take Rosanne Bar, put her in a small canopy ""emergency chute"", and drop her, at random, over the Arizona desert. (She was on her way to Vegas, baby). Calculate survivability.<p>Chutes for everyone would be expensive, heavy and probably only be beneficial in single digit percentages (or even sub single) of all crashes. They would very likely cause more problems than they would solve.",1244064112

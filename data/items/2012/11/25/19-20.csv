I've run several niche job boards for quite a while, some of them bringing in decent revenue.  The 3rd party platform I was using was one where I had to give up 50% of the revenues - not a tenable situation once I began to show signs of success.  Since I needed to build something that would support multiple job board sites - I figured why not turn it into a SaaS offering as well.  One that does not take a rev share, and charges a flat fixed amount.<p>2. I wanted to teach myself Ruby on Rails.

Over my career i've moved into higher and higher management positions (now a VP of Tech @ a media co), and thus moved further and further away from actually building things.

People who know what they are doing can completely turn the check off, or you can leave it on simply 'command-click and choose open' once to add the app to the whitelist. I do this all the time.<p>Superficially, that makes it seem like not an issue. But it's sort of like when Sony added the ""no class action"" waiver to their TOS. Yes, you could opt out, but it still removes virtually any possibility of a class action suit since very few people <i>did</i> opt out. Similarly, it is possible to run apps that aren't signed, but most users won't, and that means that it isn't viable, from a developer's perspective, to produce unsigned apps.<p>Now, it's true that you don't have to go through the App Store review process just to sign an app, but that doesn't mean that Apple can't revoke your key on a whim (or in error).<p>The cost is also an issue. $99/year is a steep commitment for what used to be a pretty big segment of the Mac developer ecosystem. The common counterargument to this is ""Really, you're going to complain about $99 when while working on a $2500 laptop?"" But this is nonsense. If you're unemployed, in school, or working a low paying job while developing on the side, your computer likely isn't a $2500 laptop. It's probably a low end Mac and/or a hand-me-down, and you will keep riding that machine until it breathes its last gasp. $99/year is about the cost of your <i>whole computer</i>.<p>Now, maybe Apple doesn't care about a slew of small, cheap/free apps with low hardware requirements, but their users sure as hell should.",1353872555

You basically gave me the best answer I could've hoped for.<p>Since you were in my shoes and I'm a lot like you, I can totally relate to what you've said. I find managing work extremely stressful at the moment, which is why I'm looking to work on my own products in the future rather than go full-time. You're also spot-on about the personal relationships part, lately it's been really hard to keep friends close and go out like I used to. For me, having a girlfriend is out of the question for now since my life is such a mess, I can totally see your point. Just like you, I'm not the most social person in the world so I'm afraid that if I start working full-time I would actually start to feel really lonely, which is one of the main reasons I am considering college at the moment, I think the social life is one of the main aspects for which it's really worth it.<p>Thanks for the money advice as I am seriously considering moving out, so what you've said made me think this through a bit more. I've always saved 90% of what I made, so the safety net you're talking about makes a lot of sense to me as well. Also, telling one of my friends how much I make is one of the biggest mistakes I could've made ( just like you said ) but since some of them were always bugging me I finally gave in. I won't ever do that again.<p>I'm aware I would actually learn a load of awesome stuff in a short time, but in my case I'm afraid the emotional stress would be just too much. In the end I guess I'm just going to go ahead with my plan of pursuing an almost-meaningless degree in order to make the most out of the college experience, and do some more freelance / work on projects I'm passionate about on the side.",1353872453

So piecework manufacturer in Minnesota has to compete with piecework manufacturer in Shenzen, and the former pays employees more and uses more automation and the latter has traditionally been able to throw many more humans at the task. Between the slowly rising demands in these countries, and the challenge of working with your factory that far away, we're just about to the point where its going to flip. I would have called it for this year but the great recession seemed to push everything back 2 - 3 years. So perhaps in 2015. Small manufacturers will either go out of business or require a higher price per good delivered, which supports effectively doubling the wage paid to their line workers. And those line workers will be essentially programmers programming tools, not doing the actual tooling.<p>The switch will be enabled by ""high resolution"" workstation automation. Today the last unassailable benefit of the 'tool and die' shop is that you've got a machinist and a machine tool which can be dynamically scheduled for any kind of widget. They are 'soft tooling' in that all of the gear that makes stuff doesn't need a dedicated fabrication line. The benefit is realized because setting up 'hard tooling' has a huge upfront cost and while the dedicated line is much more efficient, it also takes space away from other lines.<p>The calculus goes something like this : 0 - 1,000 widgets a 'precision' shop can make them; 1000+ to 50000 widgets a 'sweat shop' (primarily labor driven shop) can make them, and for 5000+ widgets you start to get the benefits of hard tooling amortized over your widgets.<p>As we get to the point where we have machines that have 'high level' sorts of capabilities (some early machines have been demonstrated by the Japanese and others) where your machine can take a dumped out pile of parts and assemble the widget, or 'partial hard tooling' where a machine creates intermediate tools to maximize efficiency ""automatically"" then it flips back to the place where a well equipped precision shop can make 10,000 widgets a month or arbitrary design <i>and amortize over all 10,000</i> which switches the economics question back to transportation and re-spins (interaction with the original designers).<p>When I see robots that can pick up a cell phone, toss it and then catch it again at an arbitrary angle, you realize you can do material transfer by having workstations literally toss partial assemblies from one station to the next. That kind of flexibility is going to make for a very different kind of factory, and of course factory worker.",1353871643

4828949,comment,4825893,4827620,1,0,saurik,,,"> ISPs were doing more and more blocking of port 25 and 587 from user connections to fight spam, and some mobile carriers had even more strict filter<p>Honestly, I personally (and FWIW, I understand that my personal opinion is not terribly valuable here ;P) feel like being part of an arms race against the ISP to not get blocked to be a battle that isn't ever going to end: I mean, even if you get to the point where they can't look at the traffic stream and see that it is SUBMIT-over-HTTP (as maybe it is SUBMIT-over-HTTPS) they can always block by endpoint. Is the next step SUBMIT-over-TOR? The devices that people are using are getting more and more locked down: they can just start checking the data streams before they are encrypted.<p>> we were actually proposing SUBMIT-over-HTTP because, drum roll, HTTP routeability was less complex and more predictable<p>Yeah, if a design criteria is ""not get blocked"", then ""over HTTP"" seems like a better option. For outright simplicity, you could even just have a very tiny shim protocol (along the lines of the first step of WebSocks) that allows an HTTPS connection to upgrade to an already-authenticated SUBMISSIONS connection that is nothing more than a direct proxy through to a SUBMISSION server. This could be specified in just a few page document and, as it doesn't allow access to the SUBMISSION server until you've already authenticated against the HTTPS one, probably adds fewer security issues than might otherwise be imagined.<p>(Although, if you want to deal with HTTPS blocking, you'd need something more complex; but if you drop all the way down to HTTP you only gain yourself a couple years before your opponent just starts blocking you using deep packet inspection: if the ISP wants to block you, and they have made it clear that they do by explicitly and knowingly blocking port 587, and you feel that the correct way to fix these blocks is using technology, then if you don't go the full HTTPS route it seems like nothing more than a waste of everyone's time; and once you go HTTPS, you get the advantage of guaranteed-to-be-proxied bidirectional sockets.)<p>> if you want to forward an email, on a mobile device, you'd have to download the email + all attachments, and then reupload the message through SMTP<p>Yeah, this is definitely a good case for having some kind of integration. I will again state that I haven't yet looked into BURL, but I intend to do so to get a better understanding of the issues involved here.<p>> When you consider someone like Google implementing mail on a BigTable cluster,<p>The main thing I've run across that is difficult to implement in this context is that of message sequence numbers, especially with regards to how they interact with EXPUNGE (but also somewhat in general). I almost brought this up to imap-protocols a couple months ago, but I found a solution (as yet unimplemented: right now I'm still pretty-much-linear for that one case of EXPUNGE as I rebuild my MSN cache; it turns out there are some cute algorithms that should allow me to store a fairly small block of data in a single row and update it fairly efficiently during EXPUNGE)  that tided me over long enough to now see Brandon Long bringing up the complaint himself.<p>If anything, I'd be then looking for just one small extension that I call (temporary name) UIDFTW, which when ENABLEd removes the client's ability to ever again use a message sequence number, forces the return of UID in untagged FETCH responses, forces the return of VANISHED instead of EXPUNGED, and replaces the message sequence number in an untagged FETCH response with ""*"" or ""-"" or ""NIL"" or ""0"" or some other ""blank"" token. This feature would be trivially implemented by existing e-mail servers: in fact, the first and final requirement could be made optional (as the client now also knows to ignore them) making this somewhat equivalent to the requirements of QRESYNC for servers that have no trouble with message sequence numbers.<p>However, for servers that do have a serious issue attempting to maintain message sequence numbers, they could then ""relieve their burden"" once this extension is activated, and not have to generate or keep around a message sequence number map for sessions that ENABLE this feature. If it is then supported by just a couple major clients, that will already be a help for servers that were willing to implement message sequence numbers, but just hated it from a resource-management and performance perspective. But, you could go further: one might eventually see clients that simply refuse to talk to a server that doesn't have it, or vice-versa. This, though, seems like a highly-minimal modification to the existing system that provides a very nice forward-looking path to something that has no problems with ""big data"".<p>Otherwise: IMAP seems fine, but I certainly have nowhere near as much context as you do; I would thereby find it utterly fascinating if you'd be willing to elucidate any (or even just one) other issues (than the message sequence number problem) that I haven't yet noticed that are going to cause me serious problems as I polish up my ""big data"" implementation of IMAP or make more progress on a mobile IMAP clients (not certain if I will actually be releasing either publicly, but certainly intend to switch to the server for my company's needs in the near future, and would start using the client myself).",1353871351

On the other hand, we had to rearchitect our solution layout to handle changing the build order, which we in turn had to do so that the F# code could be sanely usable from the C# code and vice-versa, which in turn required writing a lot of call-site boilerplate and type converters (from C# to F# types).  Add in that the CLR is simply not as optimized for F# as for C# (or vice-versa, depending on how you want to view things), and it's not exactly a situation where you can simply say, ""Well, F# is better than C# at expressing this problem, so let's use it here.""<p>I want to be really clear on this: I don't think these problems are any worse on the CLR than they'd be on the JVM or with native tools (e.g., OCaml calling C or vice-versa).  In fact, they're better in many ways: you have the BCL for your primitives, rather than the native C ABI (for native), and you have a VM that is legitimately much less tied to an individual language than the JVM, which makes things like tail-recursive languages a lot simpler.  But I think the right way to regard Foo# languages is more-or-less the same as any other language: unless you can write the entire project in Foo#, think hard about whether the cost of interfacing between Foo# and C# is worth it to your project.  Most of the time, it isn't.",1353870860

Completely free, and if you're disciplined enough, probably pretty close to a university quality education. I'll concede that this doesn't apply to hard science education where you need sophisticated labs, but it does apply to a lot of students' fields of study.<p>Hard science doesn't work with MOOC either. While I was getting my undergraduate degree, I was crawling around inside a wind tunnel setting up experiments. How do I do that online?<p>I have to say I'm bearish on MOOC. I don't think it buys you anything you couldn't do already with correspondence courses, etc, and I think many advocates of MOOC are missing the basic point of a traditional university education.",1353870721

Compare to say the Fast and Furious movies which have budgets in the 100mm range.<p>And while the current financial picture for the studios is hit driven, that's largely because of the high minimum cost to get a production done.

I have to say though that the read-write mode was not part of LMDB&#x27;s original design; it was added in response to a request from a RedHat engineer. So in its purest original form, LMDB was completely incorruptible.<p>In practice we&#x27;ve also found that writable mmap is only a win when your entire DB resides in RAM. When the DB is larger than RAM it&#x27;s actually slower than just using write(). (When you try to write to an mmap page, if it&#x27;s not already resident the OS must page it in. This is a wasted page-in since we&#x27;re simply going to overwrite the entire page.)",1441086961

Otherwise, it works fine, but I like the validity angle.<p>You can set up some migrations to be run every time. I usually set up the GRANTs that way, so I know the permissions are good right before a code deploy.

10150875,comment,10148462,10150797,0,0,wnevets,,,">Current implementation of democratic systems is result of the fact that process for voting had been expensive in pre-Internet era. One of the major thing Internet does is to make process of voting dirt cheap. One no longer has to setup physical voting booths, deploy thousands of election officials, physically tally votes and so on. This means we can give direct democracy a real chance. Why should we let senators or presidents make all of the decisions for us for years? Why not just vote for every issue directly? Why shouldn&#x27;t anyone on Internet be able to propose a law and have it voted by people in the country directly? This can change everything...<p>Cost of physically tally votes isn&#x27;t the reason the US is a representative democracy. The mob is inherently irrational, stupid and over reactive, which is why the founders settled on representatives. Case-by-cases voting also doesn&#x27;t solve this problem, even with the internet.",1441085247
10150874,comment,10148242,10150809,0,0,hyc_symas,,,"I talk a little about the history of this approach in my early LMDB design papers. The mmap approach was actually quite popular up until the mid-to-late 1980s. Up until then, 32 bit address spaces were still orders of magnitude larger than the physical memory of common machines. But when RAM sizes started approaching 1GB, and database sizes reached beyond 4GB, the notion of mmap&#x27;ing an entire DB into a process became impractical.<p>It took the introduction of SPARC64 in 1995 to really make it worth considering again, and Athlon64 in 2003 to make it feasible for mainstream computing.<p>Die-hard DB authors will tell you that having a user-space page cache buys you control - the DB has more knowledge about the workload and thus can make better decisions about which pages to evict and which to keep, than the kernel.<p>Of course, with greater power comes greater responsibility. Managing a cache, and eviction/replacement strategies in particular, is one of the most difficult problems in computing. Maintaining all of that knowledge about the workload can be much more compute-intensive than actually executing the original workload. Indeed, LMDB demonstrates that it&#x27;s <i>always</i> more costly. Kernel code can program the MMU and handle page faults much more efficiently than any user-level code. It also has global visibility into <i>all</i> of the hardware resources in a system. It&#x27;s already the kernel&#x27;s job to balance memory demands among various processes in a system. A user-level app really only knows about its own consumption; it might be able to obtain information about other workloads on the machine but only at great cost.<p>In today&#x27;s age of virtual-machine (over)use, app-level memory management is an even worse proposition. (In the OpenLDAP Project we had an effort led by an IBM team, looking into a self-tuning cache for OpenLDAP. They in particular wanted it to &quot;play nice&quot; and give up cache memory when there was memory pressure from other processes in the system, and even from pressure from the host system when running inside a VM. That effort was IMO futile and that work never reached fruition. But the mmap approach achieves all of their goals, without any of the massive amount of load monitoring and timing code they needed.)<p>On modern-day hardware with MMUs, there&#x27;s no good reason to have user-space cache management.",1441085228

In other words, long time residents would move out to make space for the people who want to move in and are willing to pay for the privilege.<p>I don&#x27;t get why there&#x27;s so much agreement here that that&#x27;s the desirable outcome.  Allowing people to be quickly, dynamically uprooted out of their homes as price volatility swings up and down in different areas -- that has a lot of real human (read: economic) costs associated with it that are not obviously to account for.  For example, the difficulty that children will face by being uprooted from their schools and friendships.<p>Obviously the cost-benefit of any particular program requires very careful analysis, but I think there&#x27;s quite some value in the idea of stabilizing rent to allow people agility to make the appropriate life changes that correspond with changing housing.",1441083969

And I understand people can have some attachment, but I think those emotions are temporary and can be addressed by making these alternative places attractive places --places built with retirees in mind.  Lots of retirees from cold states move hundreds of miles to warmer climates --there may be some thought to attachment, but mostly they look forward to places made to accommodate them.  Places where there are others just like them.  An alternative which happens in places with declining populations, is retirees dying in their homes, alone, to be discovered days or months after.<p>The poor are another separate issue.  They need to be close to jobs or at least have a way to get to jobs easily.  When I was poor, I didn&#x27;t care to live in a cachet neighborhood, I just needed to be able to get to my job with reasonable public transit and I wanted to feel the area was safe.  Of course, given the alternative, I&#x27;d want to rent a bungalow next to the beach for cheap, but it&#x27;s not a necessity and it&#x27;s not a necessity to live next to one&#x27;s job.<p>That said, I would love to see more mixed use zoning.",1441083887

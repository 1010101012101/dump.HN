Its 'game on' as they say and let the most agile win.<p>Looking at Facebook's arsenal of existing properties, combined with their large installed base advantage, and a bit of 'coolness' advantage too, the situation isn't as dire as TC would want you to believe. It does mean they will need to bring their best game to this particular dance. And somewhere in Facebook headquarters there should be a 'war room' where the folks who are co-ordinating this particular response are sharing strategies, making plans, and contingency plans, and feeding that back into the company and following through to make sure the company is executing on all cylinders.[1]<p>Of course that isn't rocket science, its management 101.<p>[1] I count the mix of metaphors at 3 sort of a sports-social-vehicular motif :-)",1313182769

2879195,comment,2878329,2878969,6,0,anigbrowl,,,"Gruber bases his analysis on Google's biweekly publication of Android version distributions, observing that for the two weeks ending July 14th, only 0.9% of 'live' Android installations were running Honeycomb (Android 3.0 or 3.1). This is somewhat disingenuous, since the vast majority of Android apps run fine on earlier versions (as used mainly on smartphones).<p>But let's go with his Honeycomb filter anyway; the latest update from Google (August 1) shows Android 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 enjoying market shares of 0.4%, 0.7%, and 0.2% respectively, for a total of 1.3%. A 44% increase in Honeycomb tablet shipments in the space of 2 weeks seems somewhat unlikely, but a portion of that may result from 'back to school' sales; that's part of why I bought mine.<p>The market is going to look very different in a year. I consider myself and Android/Google fanboy, but when Motorola launched their Xoom last winter I rolled my eyes at the absurdly high price along with everyone else. It seems to me that the Honeycomb platform didn't get started properly until April, when Acer and Asus lunched products that competed with the Ipad around the $500 price point. Since then Samsung and Lenovo have released their own Honeycomb devices, and Asus claims to be selling 400k/mo. of its Eee tablet. Amazon's two forthcoming tablets are likely to sell well too, if the success of the Kindle is any guide. I see a 4:1 use ratio between iPad and equivalent Android tablets this time next year, maybe even 3:1 if Android products cluster around the $400 price point. It took Android on smartphones a few years to achieve market parity with Apple's offering.<p>As well as being good for consumers, this is good news for developers too. From never buying any apps for my Android phone, I'm about to drop $20 today (VPN/remote desktop, pro PDF tool, sketchbook). Although I only got the tablet last Monday (an Eee btw), it's already drastically altering my use patterns, and I feel safe in finally calling the death of the conventional PC. I find the device infinitely more satisfying and productive to use than any laptop I have ever owned, and can plug in a keyboard dock if I need to do a lot of typing.<p>RIM and HP are the big losers here; I can't see any reason to buy into the Blackberry OS or WebOS from either a consumer or business point of view.",1313182269

But I'll give it a go.<p>Within 5 years:<p>- Infrastructure will improve significantly. If the economy doesn't tank so badly, we will see rapid expansion of bandwidth ""to the curb"". We're already seeing the beginning of this in unlicensed spectrum being leveraged to provide rural ""high speed"" wireless. And Google is lighting up dead-fiber like it's money is burning a hole in it's pocket.<p>- The cloud will be more federated. Instead of having two or three main incumbents in the IaaS arena, tools will gradually be released to allow individuals more authority to maintain their own part of the Internet.<p>- Data will be personal again. Projects like diaspora, The Locker Project, and others will force the API paradigm to shift toward individual users. Instead of a centralized API, a P2P network of individually managed APIs will allow web apps to get data where it (authoritatively) lives without users worrying about 3rd parties doing the right thing with their data.<p>Within 10 years:<p>- Traditional government will fragment. The existing government as we know it will change rapidly. Today's government paradigms worked for getting things done for the last century. I think it's clear that there are more efficient ways of how government could work given today's technology. I think many people will try to bring their own ideas of government forward. This will happen in a way that allows people to subscribe to the parts of government ideology that they agree with and opt-out of the parts that don't benefit them. Fragmented governments will not exist in the real world, but will be logical groups of people who self-organize online with the objective of specific benefits for their group. Traditional government will be forced to accept these ""2.0"" governments or will be shuttled gradually into obscurity.<p>- The singularity will be a lot more real and a LOT more pervasive than ever. While it will likely not happen in the next decade, we will start seeing nano-tech that we will use to improve parts of our biology. Within 20 years, bio-tech will be in the up-swing of a huge market growth that will easily be in the multi-billions.

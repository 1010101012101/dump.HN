The C# language's feature set has expanded much faster than Java's, which alone drives up the number of differences. There is a kind of ""why would you want this"" undertone to your comment - to address that: I feel there are fewer mistakes in C#'s design (generics...) than in Java's. I'd als say C# is significantly more expressive than Java at this stage. (of course, there are other languages for both runtimes)",1302116349

I was really hoping to get more feedback, oh well.<p>The big difference between inDinero is the philosophy behind how bookkeeping should be done. I think there are 2 big segments right now: Mint.com for small business (includes inDinero) and QuickBooks replacements (Xero, sassu). The latter is what we are going after, and the big difference is that all transactions originate from the user, and not the bank (you can't trust the bank, in theory). So accounting is a manual entry process, with those transactions reconciled against a bank account.<p>One thing we are working on is a mobile app for users to take a photo of a receipt and a corresponding transaction will be created based off of the information. This also digitizes all your receipts, and makes them searchable.<p>We're still validating this idea, and are getting mixed feedback. Some people love this idea, some don't see any value because they just use inDinero and trust the bank transactions. Some people save all their receipts and its a huge pain, some people don't care at all.<p>I hope this makes more sense, I'd love to know more of your thoughts.

As an Instagram Engineer, you have the unique opportunity to face many different kinds of challenges and touch many different kinds of technologies that allow the service to continue to grow at an increasing rate.<p>We're looking for people who want to face interesting infrastructure challenges. You should be constantly excited by questions like: How do you tackle increasingly vast amounts of data? You should get excited about exploring and implementing sharding and partitioning schemes. You should get a thrill out of processing gigabytes of data to inform product decisions. You should be able to design and implement systems that scale seamlessly with the vast numbers of users that decide to share their lives through images every day.<p>We also face product challenges like how to prioritize, design, and build a compelling product while maintaining simplicity and usability. Our product challenges span different platforms (mobile & web) and you should be comfortable moving between different parts of the system whether that be learning objective-c to contribute to our iPhone client, or writing solid JavaScript to make a web experience immersive and interactive.<p>Instagram is also an incredibly important part of everyone's life that works here. We pull many late nights and weekends, and you should be excited to jump in and make Instagram the primary focus of your life.

Point is: you should be able to pick up new things very quickly. \n- A demonstrated history of intellectual and entrepreneurial exploration. \n- Be able to write elegant, readable, and well-documented code.<p>We're a small team, and we're looking for people to make a big impact. This means you should want to take on lots of responsibility and be able to manage projects independently. You should be able to think critically about a problem, evaluate the solution set, and be able to pick the right course of development given the set of constraints. Of course we're looking for great engineering talent, but it's extremely important to us that everyone our team has a solid product design sense.<p>We truly believe in Instagram's potential to change the world for the better, and we're looking for a select group of individuals up for challenge to see that vision through.<p>Send your resume to jobs@instagram.com and let us know why you think you're a great fit.

2416411,comment,2415330,2415975,2,0,jswinghammer,,,"Scarcity is a key component of prices in that it affects the supply of a given good at a given price. Paper, ink, production time, human labor, etc. are all goods that have limited supply so they must be allocated accordingly.<p>If you're a parent you know that the Very Hungry Caterpiller uses different paper and different production techniques (holes in the pages, thicker paper) which while raising the cost is offset by the demand for it being much greater than TAOCP. TAOCP costs more due to a smaller demand and the fact that substitutes don't really exist. VHC has tons of substitutes.<p>I mean to say that ebooks' lack of scarcity seems to trigger consumer expectations about pricing and what they are willing to pay. This has implications for the demand curve. I wouldn't suggest that the ebooks should all cost the same but that their cost to produce additional units is zero. If a paperback book experiences a massive spike in demand that's protracted and extreme the costs of books to consumers would rise or a shortage would develop. There is no chance of an ebook shortage apart from amazon.com going down.",1302116051

The real issue at hand appears to be that people get promoted to positions for which they are not well-suited, and then stay there, because they do a lousy job (agree that this sometimes happens... although <i>eventually</i> they probably get fired).<p>What if ""promotion"" doesn't necessarily mean domain over other people, which seems to be the other issue. There can only be one SVP of Technology, for example, in most organizations.<p>What if, like in school, you get ""degrees"" for achieving things within the organization? If you launch a major new product successfully, you achieve a ""master programmer"" honor, and the associated pay benefits. This doesn't necessarily give you any right to control others in the organization, but it rewards employees for stellar performance. They can then put that on their resume if they go to another company.<p>I would argue it is a little short-sighted to say that the company can exist in a vacuum, when every other company in the world, for the most part, operates with a title. That doesn't mean you have to play that game within the company, but you should at least accommodate employees' concerns that they work for you for 10 years, and then can never get a comparable job because it looks like they never advanced. If they stay in your good graces, it probably isn't an issue, since I'm sure you will give them a good recommendation. But if not, they could be in big trouble when they go to find a new job.",1302114739

Labs are expensive, equipment is expensive so you need to get access through the gates before you can do anything. Once you are in a lab, you have to manage aligned agendas between your PI and yourself to move forward. Large bioscience is about resource acquisition.

We can optimize for that future when and if it arrives. But making your environment worse today because you worry about some possibly maybe future is the essence of premature optimization.",1302112986

Not to say your warning isn't justified, but it is part of the game that is played when dealing with 3rd party platforms. They introduce them to bolster their own networks, and if they don't like what you are doing, or feel that you are competition, they will force you out one way or another.",1302112968

This is a core capability you must own. You can and may want to hire a PR firm to supplement your efforts, but thats a different story.<p># Marketing is for companies who have sucky products. If you build something that is amazing (think Flipboard or Instagram or Instapaper) people will adopt it because it is amazing.""<p>I think it is absolutely necessary to market what you build and that is the general advice from most gurus.

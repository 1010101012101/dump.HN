4716348,comment,4715369,4715639,1,0,shawn-butler,,,"> Why on earth should multiple logins on smartphones be considered patentable?<p>The actual patent linked [0] makes several claims and it simply isn't just ""multiple logins"" whatever that means as you don't login to any phone from any vendor of which I am aware in the Symbian era (circa 2004).  The SIM card represents your ""login"" to the phone network and this patent describes all the innovations that would be required to turn a single SIM card into a usable ""public"" or quasi-public resource (usage reports, access controls to apps and data, etc etc).  Consider all of the services and technology that would be required to make this scenario possible, and more importantly usable (voicemail for each user, some way to indicate incoming calls for specific users, etc).<p>Computer operating systems support multiple user log-ins for time sharing of CPU resources and for data security. The concept here is not to have a multi user operating system in that sense. The idea is that the phone features can be shared, not the ""computer"" features.<p>So just simply having multiple logins to a linux kernel running on a phone with some UI trickery or a ""jail"" to enable a ""guest"" mode would not violate the claims of this patent as I understand them.<p>You may or may not be philosophically opposed to software patents but this probably is not the poster-child case for abuse you want to use in any reasonable discussion.  Are there any of the claims made in particular you find objectionable?<p>I read the patent claims as enabling an extremely novel/innovative use case of a smartphone.  Would you also find objectionable the patent application made by Zipcar [1] for the technique/technologies required to turn a privately held automobile into a shared public or quasi-public resource?

It wasn't a large percentage, but I never could quite understand why anyone would take the time to make a price label which showed a price different to what I would pay.

Not only is it very stressful doing it alone, it's at the point where it makes no business sense because it can't grow.<p>I could afford to hire a developer part time, but I really want somebody on the team who's passionate about building something that is theirs.  Also, I want another brain to help in all areas of the business, come up with ideas, provide camaraderie and support.<p>Perceived valuation is currently $1M - $1.2M<p>I've known a particular candidate for about 6 months and we get along well, I have trust in his abilities, and have an overall good feeling about him. I presented the idea and he expressed interest but couldn't come on full time without pay.  I don't really need full-time right now anyway so that's ok.  I'm thinking paying a reduced hourly rate (or no pay) and he can build some sweat equity.  Does a ""working interview"" make sense in this situation?  Where he ""earns"" his equity over the course of a 3-6 months through actual work and proof?  The tricky part is coming up with the numbers.  Any advice greatly appreciated here.<p>I'm curious about the different scenarios and approaches that can be taken. Also, some do's and dont's and what precautionary measures to take would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks!",1351577033

9431898,comment,9428043,9431145,0,0,mkulke,,,"Agreed. I am deeply impressed about how &quot;approachable&quot; kubernetes actually is, considering what it does. The overall design concepts are quite simple and the reasoning behind them is clear. It&#x27;s a small set of self-contained components (api, controller, scheduler, kubelet, proxy sitting on coreos&#x27; etcd), so the complexity is fairly manageable. Peeking into the source code of components won&#x27;t give you the creeps and the build system (cross-compiling) could not be any easier.<p>I have not yet tried any other docker orchestration framework (there seem to be a few popping up right now), but concerning clustering: In comparison Mesos appears intimidating to me (there is certainly not the 2min &quot;I get this&quot; experience, I&#x27;ve had with tools like etcd & kubernetes) and I remember building clusters w/ technology like heartbeat, corosync, openais & drbd not so long ago - compared to this distributed computing became incredibly easy.<p>My advise for starters would be to pick some ready2go vagrant-coreos-setup and get it running on your workstation, this should be pretty straightforward. (We are running k8s on openstack/rackspace and there were too many moving parts involved to get the included starter-scripts to reliably bootstrap a kubernetes installation)<p>Then look at the user-data/cloud-init of that project and try to rebuild things on your preferred stack from the bottom upwards, step after step - I feel a lot more sovereign when doing that. The components&#x27; logfiles are actually helpful when you assemble things. It also helps to look at the generated (and documented, thx for this) iptables nat rules, when you have problems with service discovery/communication.",1429860999

It isn&#x27;t exactly quick to render a simple hello world page, but if you mess up the state on a somewhat complex page, JSF spends ages in it&#x27;s six (yes, six!) lifecycle stages [0].<p>Hibernate is probably the worst offender.

Looking at the hundreds of generated SQL requests it&#x27;s quite easy to figure out how you would write better SQL... but you don&#x27;t write the SQL, Hibernate does :)<p>The lesson IMO is: If you&#x27;re writing everything from scratch, language performance is important.

MS is a loooong way from losing the enterprise, but that isn&#x27;t where the money (or <i>growth</i> as you pointed out) is anymore.  They really have nothing to lose from going open, so they&#x27;re best bet is to get in bed everywhere they can so they have a position to work from later if they happen to develop some advantage.<p>Apple is killing it on all fronts it competes on, but I wonder, will people continue to pay $800 for a new phone every 2 years, $2500 for a new laptop every 3 years?  My intuition says no, but from what I read, Apple is taking more and more market share where it matters, in 1st world countries where there are actually profits to be had.  I used to slag on iOs because it was so limited and primitive, but the reality is, they&#x27;re probably strategically releasing features <i>when they choose to</i>, it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re not smart enough to figure it out.  If they&#x27;re lazy, they could just let Google do all the expensive proving out of features, and then release a better version constantly a year behind and make a killing.  Kind of like what Microsoft did for so long, except Apple has <i>much</i> higher volumes.",1429859252

Even if more people read your blog post of your great idea, it&#x27;s unlikely to get cited or recognized, and might even be entirely ignored by academics.<p>Even outside academics this is true. A great essay, posted as a comment on HN or reddit, is going to be much less circulated than the same essay posted on a blog. E.g. I&#x27;ll see a good essay on someone&#x27;s blog and see that it&#x27;s posted to 12 different subreddits and HN.

When it comes time to deploy to production, maybe they&#x27;ll use Azure. VS has some Azure integrations to make it easy.<p>Now the team needs to write a mobile app. They have the option of using C# with Xamarin. Conveniently, you write Windows Phone apps in C# too, so maybe the team decides to target all three platforms instead of just the major two since they can get so much code reuse. A phone platform is really about the amount and quality of applications.<p>Sun was never able to monetize Java very well, but MS is in a little different circumstance since it has a cloud service and a mobile OS and hardware.",1429859228

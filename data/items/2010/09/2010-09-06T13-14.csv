You get the winos, drunks, and junkies.  There's a fair share of street people with mental issues.  But one thing you don't get is fear.  It's a safe place by American standards.  You also don't see many cops.  There are way more cops in American cities.  This suggests that it really is fundamentally safer.<p>I don't know why this is so.  Maybe it's because of the social safety system, maybe it's because of culture or a combination of both.  But German elites want Germany to emulate America.  The social system is under attack there and the government wants to embrace American style corporatism.  It's ironic that while it is better there those in power want to make it more like America.",1283781303

Isn't it important to understand the truth, the crux of the matters?<p><i>""Politics is the mind-killer.  Arguments are soldiers.  Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back.

I have talked to quite a few customers during our customer dev and some of them really like the idea. They think this innovation will increase their revenue but no one is sure by how much (and there is of course the risk that we are all wrong about it or the idea needs pivoting before it does that).  It also involves a little bit of hardware so I need about the amount of money an average yc company gets from yc to get to the demo from here.  I can do some other somewhat related projects to slowly raise that money but that is just wasting time.  Ideally I should just get on it and get the demo out and deployed.  Once we see what effect if at all it has on our customer's sales and how much it cost us to get that, we can iterate, price, figure out the revenue and generally write a business plan we could honour.<p>So, basically my angel's roi is not clear and  a convertible note with a reasonable discount sounds ideal but the system here is the system and I don't want to waste time fighting it.  I will put in a business plan to get talking to the right guys and then try and convince the right angel to ignore it and do a convertible note and hopefully all will be well in the world again.   This will have the unfortunate side effect of polluting my mind with fake figures and expectations which I wish I could avoid but that's just part of the game at the moment.",1283781204

But do you really think that Australia's long term future will be best served by relying on our minerals rather than our minds? It's like the economy is telling us 'this information economy stuff is all rather nice but the best thing you could be doing now is figuring out how to find and extract minerals from the ground'. I don't happen to agree but could you honestly recommend a comp sci degree over metallurgy to a financially ambitious school leaver?<p>A heavy reliance on minerals and therefore on our relationship with China seems fraught with danger. Politically speaking, mining requires 'stability' where as the information economy seems to require democracy and freedom. All income is not equal.<p>> Continued foreign investment in high risk mining activities is good for the country, and this was going to stop it.<p>It seems to me that the value of the minerals is not in danger of disappearing any time soon. So I don't really see the frantic need for us to sell it as soon as it can be economically extracted. Are we really so badly off that we need the money as soon as we can get it? Unemployment is 5%. To me the danger is that are we becoming so addicted to this revenue source that when our dealer stops supplying we won't be able to cope.<p>> If anything was to be done then the state-based mining royalties should have had some component to adjust with the price of the underlying ore.<p>You must be from WA :) Seriously though I'm not sure about the best mechanism but I think this is a situation where the pure free market could become a tragedy of the commons.",1283780835

It is hard to make them comply with a REST architecture and they kill re-usability because different services will most likely require that data + some new data that is not available in the service because it did not exist at the time.<p>You would be better served to make the services small and specific and then really analyze the data in the services for caching and use the caching mechanism of the browser to limit data request to only those things that change frequently. This will give you the best of both worlds. Specific data points with less frequent requests.<p>With large aggregated data calls it is hard to cache because of the disparate uses of the data they contain.<p>As well, If you back end is done correctly and you build your services with no run-time interdependency, it is easy to scale you application for more request.

To do so, however, is highly dangerous: the analogy is too shallow because a program is, as a mechanism, totally different from all the familiar analogue devices we grew up with. Like all digitally encoded information, it has unavoidably the uncomfortable property that the smallest possible perturbations â€”i.e. changes of a single bitâ€” can have the most drastic consequences. In the discrete world of computing, there is no meaningful metric in which ""small"" changes and ""small"" effects go hand in hand, and there never will be.</i>",1283779567

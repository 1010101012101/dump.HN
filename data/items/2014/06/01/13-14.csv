Downtown office location; no remote work.<p>We have an otherwise unadvertised full time position (3 month contract to start) open that I think is the coolest job ever: We&#x27;d like to hire a Data Evangelist; someone who looks at the reams of data flowing in from websites like Sportsnet.ca, TodaysParent.com, NextIssue.ca and 680News.com and humanizes it by finding two or three key things those brands can act on to better meet their audience&#x27;s needs.<p>The candidate would have lived through multiple website projects and would be able to suggest how to further instrument a website with analytics to capture data to help drive growth. They&#x27;d also have strong communication skills, as they&#x27;d be shifting focus month to month to try to spend time with lots of our brand websites and would meet with senior leaders of those brands to talk over their findings.<p>If you or someone you know is interested, drop me a line at sully.syed@rci.rogers.com . You&#x27;d be coming to work at 350 Bloor St. E for a division that acts like a startup-within-a-company, with people who aren&#x27;t afraid to experiment and are trying to forment a data-driven culture.",1401631164

7829148,comment,7828239,7828239,15,0,omershapira,,,"It&#x27;s funny how this idea exists in every paradigm I can think of.<p>In video editing, Avid Media Composer has an unparalleled function composition feature. All of the UI depends on it - the alt-keys form related commands, every tool has a semantic that you can&#x27;t escape. In Avid, you can only edit the keybindings for keys with/without shift pressed. No alt-pressed or alt-shift etc. Semantics of all of these come overloaded out of the box.<p>Final Cut and Premiere are a completely different thing. Infinitely customisable, you can define any key (or cmd-key or cmd-fn-alt-shift-key) to do any thing. What a redundant idea. Tools don&#x27;t carry any semantics, so if you&#x27;re trying to, say, trim 10 frames forward, but you&#x27;re not in trim mode - error beep. In Avid, the idea of modes is so powerful that each function key has maximum functionality outside that mode.<p>It&#x27;s a shame how many UI designers get it wrong.",1401631114

If there were we&#x27;d probably have sane laws anyway imo.<p>Making muffins costs you time and money, copying a digital file doesn&#x27;t (ignoring an upload limit or something). Selling is different to giving away (and a stand giving away muffins is no more comparable for the above reason). Both apply even if you use their recipe.<p>It goes the other way too. The bakery have to put employee time and ingredients into making every muffin while of course the film company doesn&#x27;t into every digital copy. For the record I&#x27;d never consider a film company a victim of piracy.<p>Again I don&#x27;t think the laws are sensible, I don&#x27;t think the way things work right now is going to continue, it&#x27;s completely infeasible in the modern world.

I&#x27;ve been working as a consultant since 1995.  I have extensive experience with Ruby (and Rails), Python, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and many other technologies.<p>My real value isn&#x27;t my extensive technological know-how.  Rather, it&#x27;s my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical people, and to turn that communication into business value.<p>I know how to take business needs and turn them into software, by myself and with others.  I also know how to describe technical issues in terms that business people can understand, that allow us to make informed decisions.  Many of my clients have used me as a remote, part-time CTO or lead developer.<p>I also help developers and teams improve their coding and management practices.  I frequently teach in-person courses (in the US, Europe, Israel, and China) in Python, Ruby/Rails, PostgreSQL, and Git to such companies as Apple, Cisco, Freescale, HP, SANDisk, and VMWare.  I also offer online coaching/pairing services to individuals and teams.<p>My aim: Long-term, interesting projects with nice people.  (Short-term relationships can also be fine, depending on the work and myschedule.)  Bottom line, I like to speak with and help nice people, and feel privileged that my work lets me do so.<p>If I can be of help to you or your company, contact me at reuven@lerner.co.il, or on Skype as &quot;reuvenlerner&quot;.

Technical solutions don&#x27;t matter when the other side has an effectively unimited budget and manpower.<p>I strongly recommend watching PHK&#x27;s recent talk talk on that subject in the link above. Avoiding politics by claiming this is a technical problem is simply forfeiting any goals you may have had to the opposition without a fight. Technical issues don&#x27;t mean a damn thing against the bad end of rubber hose cryptanalysis or the old Soviet trick of simply &quot;disappearing&quot; people, and the aren&#x27;t particularly useful against the current game of gag-order-filled &quot;National Security Letters&quot;.<p><i>THAT SAID</i><p>It is <i>also</i> a technical problem.

If you&#x27;re streaming weather data into a SQL database, it could be ok to drop inserts here and there to gain throughput for the data analysis operations. SQL has no abilities to express such a thing (except in db-specific hacks).<p>Why should the language control the underlying data store to that level?  Also, SQL itself is not defined by or defines ACID principles.  You can (and some people do) run SQL over very non-ACID databases (everyone using MyISAM or SQLite?)<p>I personally feel that tying the data-store so close to the query language is a recipe for unneeded complexity. Though, the transaction isolation levels may be close to what you&#x27;re talking about (though, I don&#x27;t think there is anyway to tell a db like PostgreSQL &quot;Go ahead, lose this. I don&#x27;t care about it&quot;.)<p>> SQL is superficially simple, but at scale the simplicity is a lie. Thhe performance trade-offs you make require you to understand the internals of the database you&#x27;re running on and how it interprets the query, and often you feel like you&#x27;re dealing with a too high level API. Often you&#x27;re resigned to &quot;tricks&quot; to force the engine to do the right thing, like optimizer hints, special index types or denormalized data.<p>Please tell me of anything where it isn&#x27;t true that the more intimately you know your tools the better you can use them. Quite honestly most query planners are really friggin&#x27; good at what they do (just like a compiler, or are you a person that still claims hand tune assembly is the answer to everything).<p>EDIT: PostgreSQL does allow unlogged tables that are not crash safe, though I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re randomly lose rows, but are faster. So there are some semantics that allow you to control that, but they are probably vendor-specific (getting into my complexity argument). Thanks Myon on #postgresql for pointing that out.",1401629695

(I understand they beat human players, but that people feel computers play in dull ways).<p>Depends on what you mean by dull.  Computers play so well that it tends to be a complete mop-up regardless of any &quot;anti-computer&quot; strategies people may try.  The dull aspect is the one-sidedness.  What&#x27;s hard to do is make computers play weakly in a human-like way.  Lobotomized computers tend to make very inhuman blunders.<p>> Is there a Turing Test for computer chess, where humans and computers play each other and they, and commentators, analyse the play, but no-one knows who is a computer or human until after the commentary is published?<p>Not that I&#x27;ve ever seen, though it still wouldn&#x27;t be much of a challenge.  Computer moves are pretty easy to spot--generally unintuitive or seemingly paradoxical moves that have a very concrete justification.  Especially, as I said above, if they were set to play at a weaker level.<p>> And if we ignore humans are people playing computers against other computers for some kind of machine learning play?\nI&#x27;ll let others answer this, but it would surprise me if nobody was.  Still, improving evaluation heuristics and analysis efficiency seems to be yielding better results than just machine learning.<p>> And how optimized for speed is the software?

Sometimes we write cool new code, sometimes we are on call dealing with a production issue.<p>* We think pushing code into production is only the beginning of our job. We are responsible for what we put out in the world, including monitoring and maintainence.<p>A few things about you:<p>* You&#x27;re an engineer, but you know how to think like an operations person.<p>* You cut your teeth in open source software, and know how to find documents, read the source, ask for help, and report a bug.<p>* You&#x27;re excited about glamorous work, but you&#x27;re willing to sometimes do shit work, because in the end somebody has do it.<p>If this sounds interesting and you think you&#x27;d be a good match, or if you&#x27;re interested in learning the skills to become a good match, please get in touch with Andrew Turley (aturley@theladders.com).",1401629060

The only way for others to obtain the decrypted contents of the transmissions between careful friends in the above situation is with some kind of breaking and entering.  The fact that most people don&#x27;t do this, most of the time, is irrelevant; it is important that we are <i>able</i> to do it if we need to.<p>The <i>only</i> way to really prevent the above scenario is to make it illegal to do some of the above things: to own a general-purpose computer that won&#x27;t snitch on you, to meet a friend and exchange something secret without having your person searched, to send encrypted information through the internet, to live in a place that doesn&#x27;t have cameras watching to see if you&#x27;re viewing illegal material, etc.  (I suppose paying a reward to people for reporting on their neighbors, friends, and family for possessing or distributing illegal material might be reasonably effective too.)  IP law is only really enforceable with a police state.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s simply because you left that information there with an implicit understanding that that information would be used only for purposes that you agree to.</i><p>Actually, sometimes the understanding is reasonably explicit.  For example, Gmail has a privacy policy.  It says, &quot;We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies: [with your consent, with domain administrators, for external processing, for legal reasons]&quot;, and later it says, &quot;If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information&quot;.<p>A website&#x27;s terms of use take the form of a contractual agreement between the user and the company; the whole thing is a bit laughable, since usually the company doesn&#x27;t have a human negotiating with the user and the user doesn&#x27;t read the policy, but the subsequent exchange of valuable services for valuable data can be construed as grounds for some kind of enforceable agreement, and the words of the ToS should at least be a first approximation to what that agreement is.  And people justifiably feel violated if someone ... violates the terms of a contract under which they&#x27;ve given up valuable items.<p>> <i>IP and privacy are both flip sides of the same coin.</i><p>Nope.  In case you&#x27;re wondering, if a Google sysadmin decides to publish my emails to the internets, I will be offended and expect him to at least lose his job, and I may have some complaint against Google, but I do not believe I have the right to subsequently prevent anyone else from making copies and spreading them around; they were not bound by any contractual agreement with me.  And I expect that, in practice, my emails will probably remain private: the few who could read them (Google employees, the NSA) risk negative consequences (firing, bad press and Google fixing their security breach) if they do anything to reveal they&#x27;ve done it.<p>By contrast, those who favor IP and use it hope to make exchange-contracts with thousands or millions of strangers, each one of whom is expected to have intimate contact with the information.  Reliably preventing any of them from sharing it requires the active intervention of the law and a lot more.<p>> <i>And they, similarly, feel violated when people access it without due recompense.</i><p>It is unfortunate that IP laws and rhetoric have given them such an expectation.  I understand some people feel violated when gay people get married in their church or when someone buys a copy of a holy book and burns it.  However, to let their feelings control the force of law would have unacceptable consequences for human freedom.",1401628967

I learned to select things (character, paragraph, end of line etc) using combinations like shift-arrow, control-shift-arrow, shift-end, and copy-paste with control-c, control-v.  It has always seemed intuitive to me and works well.<p>I believe that the reason that vim and Emacs have different keys and ways of editing which are less intuitive to me is because they were created in an earlier and more primitive era.  I believe those interfaces are inferior.<p>Now, I do use vim on a daily basis because I can use it when I shell into a remote machine and because there is almost always syntax highlighting available for any given language.  So it is my everyday editor.  When I want to indent, I use visual mode.  If I want to copy a few lines sometimes I use visual mode, or I use the mouse and the copy and paste menu options in the terminal right-click menu. Or shift-insert to paste.<p>If I want to increase the indent, copy, etc. in vim, I can select/mark an area and do like I just explained.  If I were in Atom, I would use the nice shift-arrow and control-shift-arrow stuff.  I don&#x27;t feel that it is important to be able to parameterize those operations the way he suggests, because I have adequate and/or nicer less primitive ways of doing it.<p>Its pretty amazing to me how the same people who can look at a web application and complain about a minor usability issue like not having an autocomplete for a search field can go into their editor from 1976 and think that all of the old fashioned cryptic keyboard interface schemes are the best thing ever.<p>Anyway, the only reason it can&#x27;t replace vim, which he didn&#x27;t mention, is that it doesn&#x27;t run in the terminal, and sometimes that is more convenient.",1401628941

I&#x27;ve tried (in the spirit of Feynman) to poke holes in this, so here&#x27;s the stuff that would persuade me I&#x27;m wrong.<p>1) satiety.  Some foods make you feel full, so even though they&#x27;re &quot;fat&quot; you eat less. (This doesn&#x27;t counter CO>CI but explains why people fail at it).<p>2) abysmal quality of research on weight loss.  Lots of the research is poor quality and we really don&#x27;t know what works.  Better quality research is always a good thing.<p>3) gut flora and genetics. Genetics plays a role in everything so I&#x27;m sure that it is easier for some people to be fat than others because genes.  We know that some gut flora helps some people stay slim. Nwe know that some other gut flora helps some people become fat.  A double whammy would be unfortunate.<p>4) evil food industry.  Seeing a bag of sugar (in whatever form, but especially candy) sold as &quot;LOW FAT FOOD!!!&quot; is infuriating.  I tend to ignore the HFS arguments but I agree that the vast amounts of sugar eaten today is very harmful.  Making food &quot;hyper paletable&quot; and making it seem like it is much quicker to get that food than prepare your own healthy food has done a lot of harm.  (See popcorn chicken cersus a roast chicken).<p>5) judgementalism.  CO>CI may be true but it is simplistic and it is often given with judgemental messages.  As HN middlebrow dismissal shows contrarianism is human nature, thus saying &quot;CO>CI! Develop some willpower, go for a jog!&quot; Will devolve into discussion about a bunch of stuff.  People like me need to find a better way to deliver that message.",1401628853

They take absolutely no risk, because they extensively verify the validity of the checks. While payday loansharks offer the service, it&#x27;s also offered by pawnshops (as mentioned) and check-cashing <i>trucks</i> which show up to large manufacturing businesses that use a lot of low-paid marginal labor on payday so you can get your checks cashed in the parking lot of where you work. Liquor stores also commonly run a check cashing business, and usually offer better rates than the other options because they profit from that first purchase that will be made after that check is cashed.<p>These business are purely parasitic, and take no risk other than that the fees they charge might not be enough to cover the employees, rent, and massive profit margin expected.

7829024,comment,7828530,7828966,5,0,Pacabel,,,"Even those reasons are really stretching for it these days.<p>There are numerous ways of dealing with hierarchical or otherwise structured data using relational DBs. Support for recursive CTEs is becoming more common, which makes such querying quite clean and simple. And with many relational systems offering support for storing and manipulating XML and JSON data, storing more structured data becomes a non-issue.<p>I think that SQL managing to hide a lot of the underlying implementation details is one of its strongest points. In many situations the defaults are more than sufficient, saving developers and users a significant time. Yes, there are situations where more control over the exact handling is needed, but it gives ways of managing this. At least a simplified, high-level abstraction is offered; many NoSQL systems immediately force you to take a very low-level approach for even the simplest of queries.<p>And I don&#x27;t see the ability to intentionally lose data as something that&#x27;s good, either. The database should be concerned with doing everything in its power to protect and ensure the integrity of the data it has been given. If it&#x27;s fine to lose some of that data, then whatever or whoever is providing that data should just not provide it to the DB in the first place.<p>So while some people may present those as possible disadvantages of SQL, I just don&#x27;t think the arguments really hold up upon further scrutiny.",1401628183

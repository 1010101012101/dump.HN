It then dived into the 800's so it clearly got some flags.  To sink <i>that</i> far requires several flags, so it obviously wasn't the work of a single maverick.

Yes and no.<p>Dalvik is not Java, being a totally different VM, just as .NET's CLR is. And just as .NET's CLR, you can transform Java's bytecode to Dalvik bytecode by means of a compiler. The equivalent project in the .NET world would be IKVM, which allows you to transform Jars into .NET dlls.<p>It is true that Google relies on the Java ecosystem for fueling Android ... they rely on Eclipse for IDE support, they rely on Harmony for the base classes and so on.

However, C++ includes a lot of facilities that make programming easier.  They're easy to abuse, sure, but in most cases they help make things clearer and simpler.<p>Boost is almost a second standard library (it is one reference source used in the standards process), and it demonstrates a lot of what's cool and awful about C++.  Boost invented a lot of the smart pointer classes that are now standard and save a lot of boilerplate that makes memory management in C annoying.  Boost has things like Asio, which lets you write portable synchronous/asynchronous network code.  On the other hand, it has Spirit, which is a massive abuse of operator overloading which is at once both impossibly complex and nifty/convenient.<p>Linus's opinion is worth noting, but he's hardly the best source.",1335939585

Whether this was done for legitimate reasons (like portability between ARM and x86) is not really important, what's important is that C++ is the language most games are written in and if you lack the support for it, then most games will only get ported if your platform is a clear winner, which is not the case yet for Windows Phone or Google TV ... therefore from what I know, Windows Phone 8 will have support for native code, because it badly needs it.<p>So I wouldn't worry too much about it.",1335938701

Unity = Engine + Tools<p>I've got 25 years experience making AAA games. I am continually amazed at how productive people are in Unity. I've got several x-coworker friends from various AAA game companies including Namco, EA, Vicarious Visions, and others that have started using Unity. All of them can't praise it enough. Some of these are even engine guys. In other words, the types most likely to have a ""not invented here syndrome"".<p>I've also been watching and participating in game jams and watching the amazing things coming out of them with the largest percentage coming from Unity.<p>Been to a few ""teach kids game programming"" events where Unity was one of the options and those kids always come away with more than the kids doing python, processing or JavaScript.<p>Even GDC had several unity games at the experimental gameplay session, the indie games summit and more.<p>There's also a large market of 3rd party libraries and editor plugins for Unity that provide many of those things like support for social network X or picture service Y. Unfortunately Unity stupidly made the store for those plugins only accessible from inside Unity, buried in the Window menu under ""Asset Store"" so that none of it is discoverable from the outside.<p>Of course there's a learning curve. If you've written your own engine it's easier to get a couple of images/models on the screen by writing code from scratch. But for a real game with a team that initial speed is quickly dwarfed by the amount of work writing exporters to support your artists, level editors to support your game designers and the fact that Unity editor is fully interactive while the game is playing for the ultimate in quick iteration times. You can practically edit functions on the fly as the game runs.<p>No, I don't work for unity and I actually haven't done more than a couple of  tutorials nor have I used Moai but I have written 6 game engines and all the tools and utilities for them and after seeing my various friends and x-coworker's successes and praise for Unity I'm not about to pick something that only provides 1/2 to 1/3rd the feature and therefore have to pick up the slack myself.",1335938598

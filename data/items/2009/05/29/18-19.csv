If they have such a thing, feel sexually repulsed. Increase this feeling as they are bigger, rounder, wobblier.""<p>One might argue that a man with such an instinct would do well, in the light of the changes in the bodies of women, to delete this programming entirely. However, a much smaller mutation could alter the programming to:<p>""Look at women, and see if they have a pair of round wobbly things on their chests. If they have such a thing, feel sexually stimulated. Increase this feeling as they are bigger, rounder, wobblier.""</i><p>Can we say ""pseudoscience mumbo-jumbo"" here?

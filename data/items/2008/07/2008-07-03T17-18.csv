235424,comment,235161,235161,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"I think that activism not political is the keyword.  As a current college student,  within most of the conversations that I have had with other students, they seem to be heavily opinionated and ""passionate"" about politics and their ideals but lack any real knowledge over the topics or positions they discuss.  In a half hour drunken conversation, you could turn a ""hardcore democrat"" into someone who believes they are actually more libertarian leaning (which I do believe most inherently gravitate towards when questioned over their positions).<p>Nowadays (even thought I have no clue what it was like in the past), the youth support politics as a fashion statement rather than a representation of their ideals.  They seem to fall in line with the parties and mindlessly support the policy that they believe they should.  Their knowledge of politics only goes to the extent of what there five minute glance on the news says it should be, which is quite saddening.  I am not stereotyping, but the trend I see most is that individuals fall in line with what ever there social groups expected political stance would be, the ""frat-boy"" types all tend to support republicans because they support the troops and are against gay marriage, the ""socially conscious intellectual"" student strongly supports democratic principals (or what ever the author of the book they are reading at the time supports) and so on and so forth.  Politics for many at the college level seems to just be an extension of their fashion or lifestyle, or simply what they think they should support because of the image they portray.<p>The truth is very few actually give a shit and will continue to not care until there cushy lifestyle is taken away or they are oppressed in some way or another.  Most likely at that point it will be too late.  I know I come off as a cynic but sometimes it is just too easy in this world.",1215107739

- Users who have google/alexa/amazon/etc. toolbars installed on their browsers, they browse to their personal page, or maybe bookmark it, and alexa/google immediately realize that it is not indexed so they start crawling it.<p>- Other phenomenons like Google Desktop Search crawls and caches all user bookmarks.<p>You should not use http GET method to perform unrelated operations.

235415,comment,235340,235340,0,0,mdasen,,,"They can be made pretty secure for those purposes.  Most likely what happened in your case was that one of your clients/coworkers/other posted such a URI in a blog/forum/other that Google spiders.  As a rule of thumb, GET requests should never add, destroy, or alter data.  Spiders won't* follow POST.<p>Here are my thoughts on making these URIs secure:<p>First, always have such a URI on a 72-hour dead clock.  You send the URI to the user and it's good until used or 72-hours later. Then they need to generate a new one.<p>Second, make it two factor.  Rather than having something.com/reset_pass/12345, have it be something.com/reset_pass/{user_id}/12345.  Just another level of protection.<p>Third, use base 62 numbers (0-9, a-z, A-Z).  It's something any browser can handle with no special chars. Remember, base is more important than length.  A 6-digit, base 62 number will go to greater than 56 billion different combinations.  If someone guesses from one of 56 billion numbers, holy sh*t do they deserve to break in. If you're paranoid, make it 10 digits and get over 800 quadrillion combinations.  No one is going to brute force that and 10 digits is still small to display.<p>Fourth, you can rate limit by IP address.  Set it high - like, 100 attempts per hour limit.  Why so high? You don't want to piss off users who are, well, stupid. And to get to 800 quadrillion making 100 attempts per hour would take millions of years - heck, let's say you're so high-profile that they'd put a farm of 100,000 IP addresses on it you're still looking at over a million years.<p>In many ways, these URIs can be made more secure than passwords since most passwords won't be as random or strong.  There are some caveats:<p>These URIs will show up in browser histories and your server logs.  They are one-time secure things.  Once the user has used it, the next time they need such a thing, they need a new URI.  If someone gets into your logs, they can see these URIs and reset peoples passwords unless they expire on use.  Same with browser history.<p>As I've mentioned, they can be posted.  Users post things they shouldn't all the time (including passwords).  Have it time out so it's only a breach for a short period.<p>Don't use it as a replacement for user/pass.  Just don't.  If the same URI stays good, it is insecure.<p>Good luck!",1215107252

- A server-side authentication scheme; so if the URL is visited, it can't trigger anything important without a password.
- An expiration mechanism; so that after a certain amount of time, a particular URL has no effect even if it is ""visited"".
- A cookie; so that the URL only works if visitors are people you expect (because they have the right cookie on the client side, and someone like Google would not).  Cookies are actually another way to implement expiration, too.",1215106664

531123,comment,530605,531017,0,0,jerf,,,"Yeah, that's why I called it ""what they used to call functional programming"". Functions are first-class values and closures are easy to get at. (Some people quibble with the exact implementation, but they are definitely there. Such people will be happier with Python 3.0, but still not entirely satisfied.) This is what ""functional programming"" used to mean.<p>Now it means having immutable values, tail recursion, easy lambdas, powerful type systems, and so on. There's a clear historical progression from past to present, but there's still been changes in what the term means over time which means that different people mean different things by ""functional programming"" if they don't clarify.",1237939072

531120,comment,530870,531026,0,0,cubicle67,,,"To clarify<p>There's three 'it's in the story. The first is that Apple will start offering 90 day refunds, the second is that devs will have to sign a new contract by the end of the week and the third is that devs will have to pay back Apple 100% of the purchase price of any apps returned (meaning that for every refund the dev makes a 30% loss)<p>My take - for what it's worth<p>1. The 90 day refund story is rubbish and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the AppStore and what it is. There's very few apps here <i>intended</i> to last more than 90 days. They're disposable, especially the games. You pay $1 and get half an hour's entertainment.<p>2. There is a new contract, but it states nothing of this 90 day return policy<p>3. As quoted by gcheong below, it seems there is provision for Apple to claim money back from a dev in the case where they offer a refund, however (as also noted by icey) I think this is more of a CYA clause.<p>In short, the article is nothing more than flamebait, which it seems I've fallen for :P",1237939056

I think chatty social people who can also program are becoming just as valuable as the hard-core competent hackers who write magnificent software.<p>In the unix hacker tradition we called those who spent all their time reading papers, writing USENET articles and participating in listserves ""lusers"" or Read-only users. The socialites couldn't RTFM and do everything themselves; they can write the occasional C code or Perl script but their specialty is more towards Pine, MUD games and chat.<p>All that has changed with social networks. Your project, however important, needs people like those to get the word out and keep in touch with the pulse of your industry. I have been trying to do both things for my project myself, and I can see the effect it has on my productivity.<p>When in hack mode, I can spend long stretches of time focused in Emacs churning out a great module. However, in the days and weeks I spend TABing between my editor, several PDF windows full of math, and a browser window open to library documentation and specs, I can feel myself withdrawn from the industry. Hack-mode has this weird effect on me where I no longer care about project, performance or any business goal; all that matters is code. I get flash backs of the years where I spent buried in mathematics texts oblivious to what was happening in the world. I had a different time than all of humanity; In more than on occassion I woke some afternoon to go out for coffee, just to see the streets empty and wondered where all the people went (hint: it was Christmas)<p>The same thing happens to me now when I take a few days to implement a module in my project. However, the other days when I'm scavenging the internet for information. When I'm doing subconscious analysis, catching up with the industry, taking a second look at my potential market, reaching out to peers, being active in blogs and the ""scene"". In those days, I feel my hacking mind completely removed and the only way I can communicate with it is to jot notes down as detailed as possible so my analytic self can tackle it when it returns.<p>I'm only suffering through this because of my chosen niche. A combination of industry and cultural specialization that makes finding competent hackers who speak that ""foreign"" language (in my case Arabic) a little hard. Plus it's quite lucrative, so I'm still too clingy and holding my cards close to my chest.<p>If your niche allows you to find knowledgeable peers who you can chat with about your domain of specialization, please do yourself a favor and find one partner who can do one either hacking or social networking and market research, and by all means focus on ONE. Your productivity will thank you and you might just have some fun.<p>I thank you for existing fellow HNers, let's keep the spirit of this place alive. Go and kickass!",1237938171

It's just that there's been a lot of discussion about SSL certs the past few months, and I'm willing to bet there's no more than a roomful of people worldwide with the knowledge and experience to understand how to run a CA and the costs associated.<p>Does your anger extend towards the domain name companies? Webhosts? After all, running on free software and 'cheap' commodity hardware - Dreamhost probably make the same figures you're talking about, and they don't have a lot of the large up-front an annual costs. Just an example, really.<p>To address each point:
Validation - not a fixed cost. Some can take several real man-hours to complete, and additional costs of access to third-party databases, translation costs. I see it possible to make a loss on some certs purely in validation.<p>Legal costs - insurance premiums for something this specialised are high, regardless of how many claims made.<p>CA chaining - as per other comments, you're lookat at potentially $50K a year just in audit costs, just to get into the mainstream browsers, with a 5-10 year wait to become ubiquitous enough to be commerically viable. You can pay to get a sub-CA and bypass this step, but it will cost...you can go into 7 figures annually.<p>Again, I'm not attempting to make excuses. I do agree some certificates are overpriced.

531079,comment,530605,530845,0,0,mattjones,,,"Libraries aren't the issue.  I use Chicken Scheme for a few things, which has plenty of libraries and a fantastic package system called eggs.  Sure, other languages like Perl and Python have more libraries now, but that's not what made them popular.<p>What made them popular was the design of the core languages.  I started using Ruby because it was faster to type and easier to remember how to do things than Perl, not because it had more libraries, which it didn't.<p>The problem with Scheme is that the core language isn't terse enough, and so it gives the impression that it will be hard to do things.  And that's correct.  Scheme requires much more typing and is harder to remember than Ruby.<p>Consider:<p>Ruby:<p><pre><code>  h = {}
  h[:foo] = ""hi""
  h[:foo] #=> ""hi""
  h[:bar] #=> nil
</code></pre>
Scheme (Chicken):<p><pre><code>  (define h (make-hash-table))
  (hash-table-set! h 'foo ""hi"")
  (hash-table-ref h 'foo) ;; ""hi""
  (hash-table-ref/default h 'bar #f) ;; #f
</code></pre>
That, in a nutshell, is why people don't use Scheme.  The people who made Perl etc. popular hate typing, and the core language of Scheme forces you to type a ton.  There are other problems like really slow string functions, things that should be core being in SRFIs, libraries being called ""SRFI 18"" rather than normal things like ""threads"" so that it's extra hard to tell where a function is coming from, where its documentation is, or what you have to import to get it.  Lack of libraries (if indeed that's a problem for you) is downstream of the core problem, which is that Scheme has a lot of clumsy design features that discourage would-be library writers from using the language a lot.<p>This isn't a Lisp problem, it's a Scheme one.  A Lisp with a better core and enough users would get lots of libraries eventually, just like any language.<p>I think Scheme is good for teaching though, and would rather learn it in a course than Python.",1237937565

PhysX is free, and I believe it can do those calculations for you fairly automatically.  (In PhysX, a 'scene' is composed of 'actors', and each actor is described by a set of shape descriptors.  A shape descriptor can represent a box, a sphere, a capsule, a convex hull, etc.  So a laptop actor could crudely be approximated with two box shape descriptors (one for the screen, one for the body) connected by a joint.  Given those shape descriptors, the library calculates the actor's center of mass / moment of inertia / etc.  If your CAD software simply exports a list of polygons, you'll need to decompose those into a set of convex hulls using convex hull decomposition techniques:  <a href=""http://codesuppository.blogspot.com/2006/04/approximate-convex-decomposition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codesuppository.blogspot.com/2006/04/approximate-conv...</a> )  You also might have better luck running dynamics simulations with PhysX than with ODE.

Because of that, and because we're not in a position (yet?) to buck the trend, we've stuck with the party line for now. Even Shopify (<a href=""http://shopify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shopify.com</a>), who is perhaps even more critical to the businesses on their platform, has basically the same set of terms.<p>Now, while legally there's not much we can do, on a practical level we're a support-centric organization that totally understands that our clients are building their businesses on us and that we <i>have</i> to be reliable. Our income is directly tied to our clients income, so we have all kinds of incentive to make sure that the service is always up and ready to collect payment. Also, because of the way Spreedly works, you can quickly build a layer of simple caching in to your application that will ensure that even if we were down for some reason your site would still be up and serving existing clients.<p>I hope this helps explain. I know it's not the most satisfactory answer ever, but it's an honest one based on where we (and the industry) are at this point.",1237937230

The first time I met one of the founders of Bootup Labs, this was when I was fairly new to Vancouver, I got a deep upsetting feeling in my stomach. I felt the same kind of energy from others involved in meetups they put together.  They used to hang around workspace as well.<p>Someone introduced me to a bootup labs person and within just a few sentences I knew these characters were to be avoided.  It is difficult for me to rationalize these feelings in ways that can help stop the bad future I see that makes me have these feelings.  I don't want to share the feelings, because they are just feelings.  I try to only share opinions I can rationalize, because I don't want to be wrong about a negative feeling if the person is actually good and I'm wrong in my assessment.<p>It's like when I interacted with them, I saw how the compounding negativity of their influence was going to affect the startup community in Vancouver.  My feeling made me want to stay far, far away from anyone involved in bootup labs or involved with them or their ""groups"". I want a <i>good</i> group to be seen as the leader in Vancouver, but it's almost like the stage has been set there and it was designed by bootup labs.<p>I don't know where the impressions like these come from.

The bootup labs people are great at sales and giving the impression of power, certainty, and success -- but I never saw any of it.<p>I want to help people steer clear of individuals like this, but people who say negative stuff about others are often themselves looked down upon.  Moms say, ""If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all.""

At that time, there were meager tools available to the average citizen, and innovation then wasn't like it is today. It more typically required a disproportionate outlay of resources, especially given that (at the time) labor was relatively cheaper than technology in the southern parts of the U.S.<p>Later, the U.S. underwent the industrial revolution, and innovation moved from profit-motivated individuals to profit-motivated companies; again, patents were seen -- correctly, at the time -- to be fostering the innovation that was advancing America's technological development.<p>But the landscape is much different today. The average individual has at hand resources that would have been remarkable to Ford or Edison, and probably dumbfounding to Eli Whitney. For roughly a month's salary, I might accumulate all of the materials I need to invent a new kind of robot, and if I'm interested in software, then all I need is a computer, some time, and a problem to solve.<p>So, <i>now</i> patents are no longer as justifiably the protectors of innovation, and <i>now</i> the case can be made that they are actually hindering it.<p>Conditions aren't the same now as they always were.",1271352224

There are industries where innovation is the result of serious risk and serious investment, and it is in everyone's best interest to encourage that. The rub is figuring out which industries and which classes of innovation should be protected, and which should not be protected.",1271351258

Why do I lose my right to do something because you write that thing down before I do?<p>Coming up with an idea is only a very small part of the battle.  Making a viable product is much harder but also not the biggest problem.<p>The biggest challenge often is getting people to buy a thing.  And we already have significant incentives in place for that.<p>There are things that we need that take a great deal of investment to discover and that cannot be protected with trade secrets.<p>But if the innovation is of significant value, presumably one can make a profit from it and get to market faster than the competition, so there is reward for innovating.<p>People that need an innovation can also create a bounty or reward for making it happen.

It's a simple matter to trace obesity and other health issues to the increase in processed foods. Foods which are mostly created by the companies who influence this kind of legislation. Just a few seconds of research should convince you of this...<p>This bill places just one more issue on the small farmers plate. I grew up farming and ranching. As rampant development (causing increased traffic, trespassing, liability, etc) encroached on our SE Pennsylvania farm, we were forced to downsize. After selling our cows, we turned to buying milk illegally from another local farmer. Why didn't we just buy it from a store? If you'd ever had fresh, raw milk, you'd understand.<p>Most farmers I know, farm for the lifestyle. They're an independent lot and regulations like this is only one more reason to sell out to the highest bidder, aka, a real estate developer.<p>Increasing regulation in this area doesn't only hurt small farmers, it hurts communities, businesses, health, and in the end, the human spirit.<p>Sure there must be safe food. But I'd bet, given the food I had as a child (fresh fruit and vegetables, eggs, milk, chicken, pork and beef) along with all the 'contaminants' they must have had because they weren't irradiated, pasteurized, or processed gave me a much healthier foundation than most. You don't need your own farm for this, just go to a farmer's market. If you think it's expensive, compare it to your long-term health costs. Pretty damn cheap in the long run.",1271350987

1268256,comment,1267944,1268134,0,0,cryptnoob,,,"You probably are not aware of this, but when used in this context, ""progressive tax"", you are referring to a tax system advocated by the progressive movement from the late 19th and very early 20th century.  The progressive movement is the father of modern day liberalism, and actually was a tarnished word for awhile, resulting in it's adherents beginning to call themselves liberals.  It's interesting the pendulum has swung back, to where ""liberal"" is considered tarnished, and ""progressive"" is the preferred term.<p>My point is that, the opposite of ""progressive"", in this context is not regressive, it's conservative.  Calling it ""regressive"", obviously sends very clear signals as to which one is ""good"" and which is ""bad"", by those who wish to send such signals, which is how this all got started.  However, it has now come into use by those who may not mean to imply those values, which may, indeed, be the case with you.",1271350935
1268255,comment,1268008,1268008,0,0,dasil003,,,"In reality there's a spectrum.  If the patent office would actually enforce the non-obvious clause rather than running as a cash cow then a lot of problems would be solved off the bat.<p>I think of drug companies and software companies as the two extreme examples.  Drug development is basically a money-losing proposition without patents, because it takes millions to get to anything useful, and once you do it's distilled down into something that's almost trivially easy to copy.<p>With software on the other hand, innovation happens in tiny steps.  Often patents are granted to ideas that took someone a few days to come up with.  As software is built, hundreds or thousands of these ideas come together to (hopefully) create a high value application.  Once you have a high value application as long as you don't release the source code it's not easy to copy.  The patents don't help someone recreate it.  They have to pour blood and sweat into the codebase to come up with something that actually replicates the value.  In other words the patent helps no one but the trolls.<p>Of course this is obvious to any software developer which is why we reflexively assume patents are bad.  However in between software and drugs, in the space real physical inventions, things are quite a bit grayer.  In the case of physical things, the ""obviousness"" test is a little easier to apply because everyone has some familiarity with tools and objects, and R&D can be fairly expensive for a lot of simple end products.  It seems to me that the underlying theory of patents is fundamentally sound, but just has absolutely no applicability to software.",1271350919

4310247,comment,4310030,4310030,27,0,breckinloggins,,,"So given all the hubbub lately I decided to visit Yahoo.com for the first time in years.  I'm not really Yahoo's target audience, but my second-first impressions are:<p>- That little ""Make Yahoo! your homepage"" thing that slides down and moves the rest of the content with it has got to go (especially considering there's a ""Make Y! your homepage"" link RIGHT below it).<p>- Clicking on the dot in the exclamation point still does the ""Yahoo!"" jingle, which is nice, but I don't like the new jingle.  It's too polished.  Old one was better.<p>- The actual search bar is a bit heavy and ""2005 Web 2.0"" looking, but I suppose it needs to be a little chunky to stand out from everything else on the page (and there's a lot).<p>- Overall, I like the color scheme and design, but it still feels a bit ""heavy"".  The fact that there's SO MUCH STUFF on the front page suggests that this real estate is a design-by-committee thing and that politics is heavily involved.  There's so much stuff and it's packed so tightly together that I really can't decide what I want to look at.<p>- The Olympics banner is neat.<p>- The top news rotator is OK, but it's a little clumsy.<p>- The subsections, like Yahoo! News and Yahoo! TV, feel too different from each other and too different from the main site.<p>- Speaking of target audience, the ""Trending Now"" section is neat, but I'm not sure I like what it's saying.  Between that, the ""Must-See Videos on Yahoo!"", and the ""Most Popular"" section below it, I get the feeling that I just stepped into a middle-class hair salon.  I'm not trying to be elitist, it's just that this site really seems to scream ""late 30-something suburbian white woman with a minivan"" in a way that most other sites don't, so I don't feel very welcome here.  Shouldn't the front page to one of the world's most recognized online brands start out a little more neutral and slowly BECOME about whatever it is you're usually interested in?  ArsTechnica does a good job of this, building up a ""Your Stories"" section based on stuff you've clicked on an (presumably) how long you stuck around after you clicked.<p>- A little more nitpicky, but I think it's another indication of Yahoo!'s most prime real-estate being driven by corporate politics and ladder-climbing (because I'm going to give the page designer a benefit of the doubt): take a look at all the section headings.  You have ""YAHOO! SITES"", ""TRENDING NOW"", ""MUST-SEE VIDEOS ON YAHOO!"", ""MOST POPULAR"", ""POLL"", ""FAVORITES"".  There doesn't seem to be much consistency in the color or font size with these.<p>- So, yeah, ""Favorites"".  How come I just NOW (within the last 30 seconds) found that?  It's way below the fold of the sites list.  Aren't my favorites kind of important?  Shouldn't they be above ""Yahoo! Sites""?  And why are they already populated?  Yahoo! on FB, Yahoo! on Twitter?  How are those my favorites?  I never told you I liked those...  These are the kind of things that make it a little TOO obvious that I, humble visitor, am the product being sold.<p>- The bottom footer (no, not the real footer, the footer above that) seems redundant.  ""More Yahoo! Sites"" contains only slightly different content than the ""Yahoo! Site"" area, and there's already a way from right there to see more.  If you want to promote new or underperforming sub-sites, why not try a sites recommendation engine based on the stuff you've visited?  Follow Yahoo could be placed elsewhere, and the ""About Yahoo"" stuff can certainly be combined and replace the ""About our Ads"" thing on the real footer.<p>- When performing an actual search, the results aren't too bad  (they're powered by Bing, which isn't wonderful but it isn't terrible either).  In fact, the search listings are a lot less cluttered than what Google's results have become.... it's almost refreshing.",1343606386

4310241,comment,4310030,4310030,4,0,DanBC,,,"> Better search!<p>Yahoo was known for collating links, while Google had a killer algorithm.<p>But Google's drive to make the algorithm work all the time for everybody is causing some discontent.  Power users are disappointed at (for example) the loss of +, and don't like the weird word substitutions and stemming that Google has introduced.  And naive users are confused by overwhelming choice.  They don't know the difference between the various sponsored links; they have no idea what a domain is so they aren't going to know if they're going to a trustworthy site or to scumbags.<p>Imagine how nice it would be if you entered your programming specific terms into a search engine and got carefully selected links back.<p>I don't know if free food is going to get that, but it's worth a try.<p>EDIT: I've just visited the Yahoo page for the first time in many years.

Id bring this bad mood to work with me, in turn making it a worse place to be.<p>Ive since made an asserted effort to dedicate time to my social life: going on trips with friends; going on dates; and, most importantly, getting work completely off my mind occasionally.""<p>Serious question (and my thoughts) here I'm not trying to be cute. Regarding your ""social life"".<p>Do you think you will grow out of this? Because what do you think is going to happen if/when you are married and have children and aren't living in SF or some exciting place and have much on your plate?<p>The best way to insure that you can live the life you want and have some fun is to put all the effort in that you can now and try to put off having fun until a bit later on. Now is when you have energy and should be able to work non-stop with very little else. (I didn't surface for air for 7 years working 6 to 7 days a week ..)<p>I point this out also because the world is littered with people who didn't get into a good school because they spent a bit to much time worrying about missing something or having fun and are paying for that later. I'm sure you've met people like this in your high school.<p>It's a little unclear how long you worked before you realized what you wrote. It was certainly less than two years since you wrote this: ""Ive grown a lot as a person in the past two years."" That's not a long time to be denied the pleasures of other people and fun (look at people on tours of duty in the war or speaking of my own experience).<p>The fact that you never had a problem until later means you really haven't dealt with the situation you are in now in the past which I think is what you are saying. Things were easy for you until you got around a group of people who were also good. I know first hand about the MIT syndrome since I saw others that suffered from it at the school that I went to which was quite good.<p>I didn't suffer from that for one simple reason.<p>Things were never easy for me it always took hard work and it also took plenty of effort for me to get into the school I went to. So when I got there I didn't fall apart if I got a ""B+"". I just kept chugging away while the ones who were ""so much smarter"" who got in with their top grades and SAT's wilted under the pressure of having to do so much work. This was a long time ago compared to when you are in school. So to answer your question, no, things haven't changed that much.<p>You've got plenty of time to have fun. Now is the time to work as hard as you possibly can with minimal breaks in order to achieve your goals. You might not surface for air for a few years but it will probably be well worth it.<p>One last thing. There will be times in life when you might have some crisis either in personal life or business that will require you to work all the time. I had a case where several of my top people left, I was in the middle of a legal case, and a breakup, and I still had to show up to work doing the job of three people and deal with personal issues and family fights. Having to go through that and knowing I could (similar I'm sure to having climbed a certain mountain like you are doing) was a great experience that made me realize that I didn't have to be scared of the unknown and that I could handle it.",1343606057

The guideline to not ""charge them directly"" is in contrast to say lead-acid batteries, which you can simply hook up to an appropriate voltage supply and let them sit indefinitely (""trickle charging"").<p>To the extent that you need to worry about it, the voltage on the two will be the same. The battery power only drops as you're drawing current. The point of the capacitor is to smooth out changes to the load by supplying current ""first"". Your capacitor will never get ""more"" charged than the battery somehow. The main difference versus ""charging"" is that you have no external energy source.<p>From a slightly more advanced perspective, the reason for the capacitor <i>is</i> to smooth out the (possibly bidirectional!) transient loads on the battery. It's quite possible that your ""inductive buzzer"" (depending on how it's driven) is actually backfeeding a little current through the arduino and onto the supply rails. Your battery will never be overcharged this way because any such energy came from the battery itself, but smoothing out the spikes with a capacitor eases the stress on the battery. In fact, I'd be surprised if the arduino board didn't have a decent-sized capacitor immediately on its supply lines, and this is part of the reason.",1343605152

Because a lot of people look up to you and either you said this because you feel defensive about your project or you said it because you genuinely don't understand the cases we're talking about here. And this is a problem because a lot of people look up to you and what you say, so when you say something as baffling as this response, you run the risk of leading a lot of people astray.<p>I was sort of at a loss for how to reply in the time I have to spare for Hacker News, but thankfully Aphyr did for me. But let me clarify what I said a bit, since I was a bit terse: The problem Node.js has is a social one. A lot of node hackers take the stance, ""I thought Node.js solved the problems threads presented,"" (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nodejs/eVBOYiI_O_A/kv6iiDyy9ZwJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nodejs/eVBOYiI_O_A/kv6iiDyy9...</a>) like there is a single axis of superiority and Node.js sits above the methods that came before. But the reality is that Node.js is really just another possible implementation in the Ruby/Python/Pike/-Perl- space, and shares most of the same characteristics as those languages.<p>So you have a lot of people who are aces at front-end programming in the browser thinking they have a uniformly superior tool for tackling high-performance server problems, but really they don't have that; they just have a tool with familiar syntax. And so they fearlessly (and perhaps admirably) charge into the breech of platform programming without realizing that the way people scale big projects involves a lot of tools, a lot of thought about failure modes, and a lot of well-established algorithms with very specific tradeoffs.<p>And so this is Node.js's problem. It's just another gun in the gunfight, but its community thinks its a cannon. In a world where high-performance parallel VMs like Java or Erlang have very powerful and helpful languages like Clojure or Scala on top, we're in a funny situation. It becomes increasingly difficult to justify all these GIL-ridden implementations of languages.<p>Which is not to say these implementations don't have their place (and Node.js is hardly the first javascript implementation outside of a browser), but increasingly they are losing their place in the pieces of your code expected to shuffle data around efficiently in the backend of modern distributed applications.<p> Correction, perl 6 doesn't plan share this behavior.

People are so focused on making things that I find to be totally trivial and banal. How many more note-taking apps, organizers, and social whatevers does the world really need?",1343602929

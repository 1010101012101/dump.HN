10386312,comment,10383043,10385967,0,0,barry-cotter,,,"> And an empire with the world&#x27;s largest military, ruled by a despotic aristocracy which had made most of its money from slavery, drug running, and land + resource grabs in distant countries.<p>Calling the ruling class of the British Empire a despotic aristocracy is a very big stretch, or better a contradiction. Despotic regimes have non-existent or vestigial aristocracies, e.g. the Ottoman Empire or most Chinese dynasties. The Russian Empire had an aristocracy had what looked kind of like a Western European aristocracy but a service nobility functions very differently from one where the nobility have independent power bases. For much more on this Francis Fukuyuma&#x27;s &quot;The Origins of Political Order&quot; is excellent. In brief there are three political classes in pre-modern societies, the monarch, the high nobility and the gentry/bourgeoisie. The peasantry are irrelevant because they can&#x27;t coordinate so their numbers are moot. A strong civil society with rule of law that binds the king/state as well as other actors emerged only in Western Europe. If the law binds the king he&#x27;s no despot, and it did. In Britain, Scandinavia and the Netherlands the king allied with the gentry, in France and Iberia, with the nobility but their power was constrained.<p>Imperialism did contribute to the power of these states, more to the noble class than the country as a whole but it was not where that power ultimately came from. It came from growth in economic productivity and the organisational capability it made possible. The British Empire was not planned, it was the product of absurdly huge differences in capability. It was acquired over centuries by men on the spot chasing personal glory and advancement.<p>This is not to deny the slavery, drug running and land and resource grabs but they are frankly secondary. The Royal Navy was <i>the</i> force behind the destruction of the slave trade. The British parliament abolished slavery within the British Empire over the protests of some very rich and well connected domestic interests. The opium trade and the  immiseration of India were enormous crimes but the capability preceded the crimes and was only possible because of it. Britain&#x27;s wealth was not built on the Empire, it was built on trade, commerce and industry.",1444827422

That&#x27;s precisely my point (just stated better than me). Erlang looks like being a very good fit for a large class of applications of this form. mnesia, on the other hand, is not well suited as the persistent storage for them. It would follow then that it could make sense for the &quot;next gen&quot; storage for Erlang to be more in line with this sort of thinking in the way you describe.<p>As to the drop in $/TB, it&#x27;s been pretty steadily exponential. But the cost of consuming and analysing TB of data has only really been practical for non-specialist houses for 5-10 years. When you&#x27;re in the low GB range then a static data picture makes sense. When you&#x27;re able to play with TB of data then a dynamic picture makes sense and Erlang really shines.",1444827265

It also kills less birds and bats than buildings, cell towers, and cats.&quot;<p>Wind might be cheaper in the very best siting areas. The long-term durability of the generators remains to be seen.<p>Regardless, the affordability and effectiveness of wind has long been exaggerated by advocates. Here is a more balanced treatment:<p><a href=""http://www.strata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Full-Report-True-Cost-of-Wind1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Full-Report...</a><p>The report&#x27;s conclusion:<p>&#x27;The true cost of wind energy is higher than most cost estimates calculate. Mandates requiring the use of wind energy increase electricity costs for consumers, and subsidies mask the actual cost of doing so. RPS require intermittent renewable energy to exist, but at the expense of utilities and consumers. The PTC makes wind power cheaper for utilities and consumers, but at the expense of taxpayers.<p>Through such policies, U.S. policymakers have essentially decided that electricity consumers will have wind power, even if it is more expensive. The cost of this decision has fallen to U.S. taxpayers and consumers of electricity. When weighing the costs and benefits of wind power, not including all of the hidden costs makes wind power appear to be a more attractive option than it actually is. Energy policy decisions, however, should be based on a more complete estimate of the cost of wind energy.&#x27;<p>&quot;You mention next-gen nuclear tech will come in at 5 cents/kwh. Utility solar is already below 4 cents/kwh&quot;<p>That is heavily subsidized, and also in the very best siting environment. Obviously those installations produce nothing at night, and even during the day average well under their peak output.<p>Solar is in no way a replacement for reliable, 24/7 nuclear generation.",1444824693

Handling taxes and keeping up-to-date with them is very hard, that’s why we provide a tax API and the sales tax calculation feature directly within the checkout.<p>We want to simplify your billing flow.\nWe provide webhooks, API, widgets that make receipts immediately available via the billing page for your customers.\nOur goal is to connect to a maximum number of payment solutions and to open the checkout to third-party applications like accounting & analytics apps.<p>Bonus: With our back-office, you can design your own checkout to fit your identity, magnifying your customers experience and increasing your conversions.<p>In conclusion, Checkout by Octobat is pretty simple:\n1- Just connect your payment gateway(s)\n2- Select the options you need and style your checkout\n3- Paste the single javascript line of code into your code",1444824300

A man with a gun will come and take you to jail. It is that simple.",1444824206

It doesn&#x27;t mean both can&#x27;t also teach us about timeless themes, the human condition, etc.</i><p>Eh, I doubt that even this snob needs to be told that - opera (which was instrumental in the development of the forms that define the classical repertoire) is replete with sex, violence and bawdy humor and the giants of the repertoire are very colorful characters.<p>My hunch is that his anxiety has more to do with the constant fear of &quot;the new&quot; in orchestra halls, where anything less than 100 years old is looked at suspiciously.<p>As a nerd for all kinds of musical genres, including &quot;classical&quot;, this kind of anxiety is evident just about everywhere in some shape or form - indie rock, metal, rap, country, etc, etc.  Every genre is constantly changing and crossbreeding, and everywhere there are purists trying to hold on to their image of the genre and performance scene when they fell in love with it.",1444824137

So for adtech to start pushing the direction in which erlang/mnesia evolve would be wrong.<p>As for the drop in $/TB of storage, that drop has been steadily going on since the 70&#x27;s of the previous century and for a very large chunk of that period Erlang/mnesia have been adapting bit by bit to take advantage of that price-decrease.<p>Persistence of time series and event type data does not (usually) require the kind of storage solution that mnesia offers, a much simpler storage medium would probably suffice and/or be a better choice for that application anyway, storing such data without further processing in a relational database is a bit of a cop-out.<p>Most of those applications could benefit from digesting and compression which is something you&#x27;re not going to easily retro-fit onto an existing database.",1444824017

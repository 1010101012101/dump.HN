The experience is unique for every individual.<p>I switched to a Mac about four years ago, and I can't stand task switching in Windows/GNOME/KDE.<p>- Menu location: Having the menu at the top of the screen actually makes it easier/quicker to click (see Fitts' Law).<p>- Context switching: Context switching on OS X has more granularity. The up-sides of this are similar to the up-sides of tabbed browsing. Think about it for a moment. What's so great about tabbed-browsing? You can group windows and switch between tabs with ctrl-tab. On OS X, you have even more granularity:<p>App switching: cmd+tab<p>Window switching: cmd+~<p>Tab switching: app-context dependent cmd+<shift/opt>+arrow or ctrl+tab<p>My biggest complaint is that there is no consistency to the tab switching shortcut.<p>When trying to find a window in an environment where there are lots of windows, Expose is one of the rare times I find the mouse faster than the keyboard. I have key bindings for app and system-wide Expose, so depending upon my needs, I'll switch to the app containing the document and app-Expose, or I'll just use system-wide Expose.<p>It's more complicated, but when I use my computer, I feel like I'm playing an instrument. My muscles know where to go for any given task, and I can move around very quickly.<p>Much better, IMO.",1285275500

You need two Finder windows open in order to accomplish this, whereas Windows Explorer, whose left pane has the directory structure and right pane has the contents of the currently selected directory, lets you do this effortlessly using only one window.<p>--but I think that it is possible to do this on a Mac by opening Finder, clicking to the file you want to move, and then making sure that the third of the four display modes available (it looks like three vertical bars) is chosen. (These icons are right of the forward/backward buttons on the left of a Finder window.) This changes the display to a directory mode and allows you to drag and drop files from any subfolder to any other. Hovering over a folder's name while dragging a file will open that folder in the rightmost column and allow you to move the file to any subfolder.",1285275157

1721376,comment,1720555,1720873,0,0,bradleyland,,,"You've got two options for integrating C code in any Ruby application: RubyInline and Ruby C extensions.<p>RubyInline is incredibly powerful. You can drop C straight in to your Ruby scripts for operations that would be too computationally intensive for Ruby.<p>Ruby C extensions are more powerful, as they allow you to call C code from within Ruby. However, it does require some alteration to the C code, so this won't do if you have a closed source C library.<p>As others have suggested, there are ways to make system calls from within Ruby, and with the way things work on Unix systems, that's a perfectly acceptable alternative.<p>Also, to address your question more generally, there's nothing that says you must constrain all your code to the confines of MVC logic. Gems are packages of Ruby code. If you find that you need a set of objects to handle complex business requirements, you could always package up that code as a Gem for use and distribution within your company. Gems are very easy to build and include in your projects, so the barrier of entry is very low.<p>I've been working with Rails since version 0.7. I've seen a lot of developers convince themselves that their problem doesn't fit in to the Rails box. While I always advocate using the right tool for the job, most people are wrong when they reach the belief that what they're doing isn't a good fit for Rails. It's usually an inability to understand where their ideas fit in to the broad scope of the MVC design pattern.<p>Having said that, there are plenty of ideas that don't fit Ruby on Rails, or MVC for that matter. Twitter was a great example. You don't implement a ultra-high-volume, low-package-size messaging system using an off-the-shelf MVC framework.<p>Very few problems are Twitter, however. Most business problems are 90% CRUD with a sprinkles of interesting work in between. Rails is a great fit for these types of projects because the ""magic"" peels away gracefully when you need it to.<p>There is another aspect of Rails that doesn't get much lip service. Rails is great because it makes a lot of decisions for you. The developers call this being ""opinionated software"". Maybe I'm just a little too humble, but a lot of the guys that work on Rails are bigger thinkers than I am when it comes to software frameworks. A lot of people won't admit it, but there is plenty of software that tries to copy the Rails way of doing things. That's at least some level of acknowledgement that they're things right. What I'm getting at is that there is a lot to learn from digging in to Rails on a deeper level.<p>The ""Rails way"" also extends beyond actual development and in to deployment strategies. Before we moved to Rails, we didn't have a sound deployment strategy. Rails developers just assume that you're going to use some type of SCM and deployment strategy. The most common being Rails/Git/Capistrano. If you say on the beaten path, there is a tremendous wealth of information available for all manner of deployment strategies. Again, these solutions fork for 99% of use cases. If you're a one-percenter, you're not going to benefit much from Rails, but make sure you've qualified your case and not just suffering from a case of ""I'm smarter than the world.""<p>That wraps up my thoughts on the matter. I'm sure there are other perspectives out there.",1285274915

Put everything in your name regardless of your skill set. Buy the domain, incorporate the company, get a basic site up, get a logo, create the twitter account, etc. Now you have complete control over your company and the percent ownership you retain: 100%. This gives you the leverage to make someone a co-founder based on performance, not initial enthusiasm and an idea.<p>If you already formed your entity then things are going to get a little dirty. First, talk with the other co-founder that is pulling his weight and write down everything that you guys do. Write down everything that you two are responsible for that the third guy can never catch up to: professional relationships built, developer stuff, etc. Write down everything the slacker is responsible for and what little he's actually done. Next, talk with your supporting co-founder about how to split up the company. Should the slacker get 10%? Less? What does he bring to the table?  15+ years of experience isn't worth 1% if it doesn't bring any tangible value.<p>Then the dirty part: confront Bob. Read Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" first. The more aggressive you are during this conversation the uglier the outcome is going to be. Be honest with him, but don't say ""You do nothing."" Say things like ""I feel like I'm getting hosed here. I do 50% of the work for only 33% ownership"". Notice the difference in perspective?  You're not blaming him for anything. Go over everything you and Fred have done. Ask Bob what results he has to show for his work. Negotiate terms and let him know that work has to get done.<p>If that doesn't go well, depending on your operating agreement, boot him from the company or dissolve it and start a new one.<p>Hope that helps and good luck!",1285274433

They are both right, but one is more right than the other.<p>Joel is talking about market value.<p>What Joel is saying is ""dude, you don't understand value. Value is what people are willing to pay for. If someone - just one person - is willing to pay $100 for a millionth of a broken piece of crap, then that broken piece of crap is worth a hundred million dollars, <i>your opinion of it notwithstanding</i>"".<p>He's right. Technically.<p>But David does not care about market value (although he tries to attack it and picturing it as not real). David is talking about <i>intrinsic value</i>; he's saying: ""this thing has 500 million users, and that's amazing. But they don't make much money out of all those users, let alone any profit. So if we try to estimate the present value by actualizing future cash flows, we find the real price should be... well, not much"".<p>He's also right. And I think he's fundamentally right.<p>During the housing bubble, some people (Peter Schiff for example, or the heroes of <i>The Big Short</i>) argued that the real value of housing was a multiple of rent (10-15 times rent), and that anything above that was crazy.<p>At the time, they were wrong -- they were very wrong; the value of a house was the market price, not the ""intrinsic"" price. The value of anything is always the market price.<p>But then suddenly there is no market. The bubble bursts and nobody's buying.<p>In that situation, if you're selling you don't have many options; but if you're buying how do you calculate a price at which you'd be willing to buy, and a price at which you may convince a seller to sell?<p>- - -<p>In a sellers' market (Joel's market) prices are fair because people accept them. If everyone wants a piece of Facebook at any price, just because they have to have it, then, well, the value of Facebook is infinite. It's not 33 billion dollars: it's the whole amount of dollars in the universe, plus one.<p>But this situation never lasts. There has to be a time when Facebook will be out of fashion, and someone will have to ask what is the intrinsic value of this thing.<p>The intrinsic value is hard to compute because you need to actually know how the company makes money, you need to understand its operations, its cost structure, strategy, etc. That's hard work for a public company; it's almost impossible, from the outside, for a private company.<p>But one thing is certain: the intrinsic value of Facebook is not infinite.<p>And then and there, David has a point.",1285272917

There's a good chance on a big site you're not in the same group.<p>On the otherhand you could end up with groups that have wildly different front pages that don't suit your tastes.

1721131,comment,1720604,1720860,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I wish I had the expertise or the time to give a better rebuttal to this, instead I'll just point out a few things:<p>First, the 2.4ghz spectrum is not the best for wireless comms, there were many reasons for opening up that spectrum and very few of those reasons were because it was an optimal signal frequency.<p>Second, bandwidth. The 2.4ghz spectrum is confined within an 82mhz band. The available whitespace spectrum has a significantly larger bandwidth.<p>Third, technology. 802.11b and g are based on technology that is now stale by more than a decade. Today's wireless broadband tech makes those protocols look like a 56k modem.<p>The combination of these factors allows for stunning possibilities. More efficient broadband technologies, better broadcast frequencies, more bandwidth. These allow for more users with higher data rates at farther distances from base stations. It also makes things like bridging access points a lot easier. There's little reason to believe that in 10 years whitespace broadband access points won't be utterly ubiquitous.<p>As for WiMax, that's not open spectrum, consumers can't buy a WiMax AP on newegg. That makes it an entirely different beast.",1285272236

6450698,comment,6448194,6449549,1,0,bhauer,,,"This is a really good point.  When I&#x27;ve heard others cite their satisfaction level with desktop displays, I ask them to go through an experiment.<p>I&#x27;ll put aside the size portion of the debate since I can&#x27;t really fathom how anyone could argue against a desktop display that can fill their entire field of view, assuming such a display were available and economically priced.  I think those who argue for small displays on the desktop enjoy being contrarians, and they bring up matters of taste and style (such as &quot;I don&#x27;t want something so large on my desk.&quot;).<p>But in terms of clarity, the argument posed by those satisfied by the status quo usually is composed of these points:<p>1. Users sit at a distance of 2 to 3 feet from a desktop display.<p>2. Therefore, high-DPI is not meaningful because the human eye cannot perceive additional clarity at that distance.<p>3. High-spec IPS LCD screens are good enough.<p>So the experiment is simple enough:<p>1. Find an iPhone 5+, Galaxy Nexus+, or Lumia 920+.  Something with a high-DPI wide contrast-ratio display.  Open up a web site or document or whatever.<p>2. Do the same on your PC.<p>3. Hold the phone up side by side at the same distance.  Zoom the phone&#x27;s text to match the text size seen on the desktop display.<p>4. Behold how the phone&#x27;s display is <i>considerably</i> more readable.  For most combinations of phone versus desktop display, the phone&#x27;s display will be crisper, have better contrast-ratio, and better color accuracy.<p>My Lumia 920 (not even an OLED, just a nice high-DPI IPS display) utterly shames my Dell U3014 IPS desktop LCDs.<p>Reading text rendered with high-DPI, high-quality displays at 2 to 3 feet is an absolute delight.  Not only that, you can lean to see greater detail.  Yes, 2 to 3 feet is the typical distance, but sometimes I like to get closer to my desktop display to work with fine details.<p>I would pay a steep premium (but obviously I wouldn&#x27;t break the bank) for a desktop display that matched the clarity of my phone&#x27;s display.  If I could just tug at the edges of my mobile phone and make it magically grow to fit my desktop, I would be so happy.",1380203625

I had to laugh, there wasn&#x27;t a single exception and not a word spoken, as new people got on, sat down, and pulled out their phone. This went on for 10 or 20 minutes, then finally someone made a noise. It was a women pointing to her screen to share something with a friend next to her. Then they both went back to their separate phones and the mobile train continued forward.<p>This was the first time I noticed <i>everyone</i> on their phone, and I felt like I was in the twilight zone. There would be groups of three or four friends sitting in a line, not speaking a single word. Eerie.",1380203527
6450688,comment,6450466,6450466,54,0,JackFr,,,"This argument makes no sense.<p>Small presses fail because they generate the bulk of their sales from Amazon, but the margins are too thin when they sell on Amazon.  Presumably if they don&#x27;t sell on Amazon the margins would be healthier, but sales would drop precipitously.  So if you can&#x27;t make money with Amazon and you can&#x27;t make money without Amazon it seems to me Amazon isn&#x27;t the problem.<p>It&#x27;s true Amazon took the fat margins, but it gave them to consumers.  I suppose this guy is just asking nicely to get them back to support his sclerotic business model.  But in the long run it&#x27;s unlikely that people are going to pay more for a worse product.<p>(On the other hand maybe he could sell the book at the locally-grown organic farm stand.)",1380203526

There isn&#x27;t even anything in the Bible about doing that. Oppressive theocratic regimes aren&#x27;t caused by the religious texts they interpret. The Turkish people have a very tolerant culture, despite being an Islamic nation.<p>The fact is, when a set of beliefs is used as a foundation for nation building, it usually gets twisted over time to create an oppressive regime. Think about the rhetoric of Communism, how explicit that is about equality and fairness, and how well that turned out. It is not amazing that Islamic nations are shitty places to live.

I think there are a lot of developers out there who don&#x27;t write tests, or only write tests because you&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to (as evidenced by the popularity of the Stack Overflow question &quot;Is Unit Testing worth the effort?&quot; <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/67299/is-unit-testing-worth-the-effort"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/67299/is-unit-testing-wor...</a>).<p>They don&#x27;t see the benefit for themselves, but like proper documentation, it&#x27;s mainly a courtesy to other developers.<p>What I wish I was told about testing is that if you modify your workflow, it benefits YOU as well as your colleagues. Without testing, trying out a feature means:<p>1. Make changes.
2. Restart application or server (possibly refreshing page).
3. Go through a series of clicks or keystrokes.
4. Didn&#x27;t work? Go to step 1.<p>Steps 2 and 3 can take a lot of time, and you&#x27;ll likely be doing it over and over again (boring!). With testing this becomes a 2 second cognition-free process, and even that can be automated with Grunt/gnotify notifications. The boring part of coding is now automated. With good coupling, you can quickly isolate your change/compile/run cycle to the part of the code you&#x27;re working on.<p>Programmers already know the benefits that testing brings 6 months down the line when something breaks, but it&#x27;s wishful thinking to expect people to think that far ahead (and smaller companies are often in a hurry to get something out the door before the money dries up). If you want intrinsic motivation to write tests, you learn how to work such that tests provide immediate benefit.",1380202851

My phone is still the cheapest Nokia phone I could get.<p>The social behaviour they generate is interesting on every front. For instance, there&#x27;s this shopping mall close to the center of the city where I live. On the last floor, there are a bunch of restaurants, a small tobacco shop and the toilets. I go there fairly often, either for the tobacco <i>or</i> to hit the toilet.<p>Every restaurant has incredibly pushy promoters; the moment you set foot on that floor, these people immediately start handing you flyers, telling you about their restaurant, following you a couple of steps. I do my best to be polite with them; I know they&#x27;re working on next to no payment, for imbecile bosses who think this is a good sales technique, so I&#x27;m never rude with them or anything. I just smile and say &quot;Yeah, maybe some other time&quot;.<p>Sometimes, however, I&#x27;m just not in the mood for that. Long days, my own retarded boss, the incredible urge to go to the toilet (for some reason, there&#x27;s no toilet around the place...), my hurry to get home and, until about a year ago, a lingering depression, simply mean I&#x27;m sometimes not up even to the little human interaction I need in order to politely refuse them.<p>So I just pop up my phone and pretend I&#x27;m reading a message or dialing a number. Suddenly, everyone&#x27;s OK. No one would even dare disturb me. If I pretend I&#x27;m <i>talking</i> on the phone, the pushier ones will apologize for disturbing me, but will otherwise eagerly present me their offering. But if I have my eyes buried in it, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m suddenly invisible. One time, I even had to wait there for one of my friends to arrive, and stood there for at least five or ten minutes. No one even approached me as long as I kept my eyes down.

The community Islamic courts you cite are a perfect example of this. You seem to expect them to behave according to some monolithic interpretation of Sharia law. Whereas, in reality, these courts are run by the Islamic community and are presided over by local religious leaders who make decisions (and interpret the laws) according to their own beliefs, informed by their own prejudices and self interests.<p>If you have any doubt that this is true, then simply consider that there are moderate Muslims in the world, and there are Muslims that believe God wants them to commit murder. Do you think it is a coincidence that those who see the West as the devil come from countries where the West has severely harmed in the past through selfish and corrupt interference?

China and Russia? I think it was pretty bloody obvious that nobody was suggesting to all start using cloud storage in those territories instead. But even then, it IS strictly better to have your data surveilled in part by China, Russia and the US, than to have all of it surveilled by a single entity, the US. Because you know it won&#x27;t be shared between them, and that is a tiny bit of privacy gained. So that&#x27;s already where your silly defence of your beloved Orwellian government falls apart.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s other places still.<p>Take the Netherlands, definitely another bad choice, but at least none of these &quot;major covert agencies&quot; have a direct line into our data. Our own secret service (AIVD) can be rather cosy with the NSA, and they definitely perform surveillance on a level of intrusiveness that equals and exceeds that of the NSA, <i>but not on a level of SCALE</i> and that is, when it comes to data and privacy, what can make all the difference. When the NSA comes knocking on the door of a Dutch Internet hosting provider (this happened), they will refuse or tell them to contact the police or something. We have no &quot;gag orders&quot;, &quot;secret laws&quot;, &quot;plea bargaining&quot; or similar Kafkaesque nightmare fuel like the US, so if the police forces a company to hand over data to the US <i>without an extremely good reason</i>, heads will roll. Like everywhere, there is a lack of accountability in NL, but this much I trust. You guys wouldn&#x27;t need gag orders if no one would give a shit, after all.<p>So, a tiny but heavily surveilled country like NL is already two steps better for hosting data than the US. And then there&#x27;s even better places. I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve heard people mention Switzerland? What about some places in East Europe with not too much oversight? Either way, just fragmenting all that data instead of keeping all of it right in the hole of the beast, is going to make it a lot harder to develop a terribly powerful singular system such as XKeyScore.<p>Then, there&#x27;s of course the tiny little slight caused by the fact that hardly anyone in the US gave a damn about the whole world&#x27;s Internet data being intercepted and analyzed by the NSA, but only started to complain when it turned out that included them, too. Not just that, but even right here on HN some people have the audacity to argue that it&#x27;s fine (<i>expected</i>, even) to do this to the world, as long as there are legal checks and rules before the same is applied to US citizens. Doesn&#x27;t sit very well with me, that. Is already a <i>great</i> reason to grab my data and take it some place else, and tell all my friends in the world to do the same.<p>So just stop, stop making excuses for the US or the NSA, and start acting like a <i>citizen of the world</i>.<p>This is the Internet, this is the 21st century, just grow up beyond &quot;but they&#x27;re doing it toooooo!&quot;, and who are you?",1380201491

6450415,comment,6450052,6450052,1,0,gexla,,,"Since you mentioned Ruby and JS I assume you are talking about web applications. What I find interesting is that many web developers spend so much time in building applications yet don&#x27;t have any experience in doing the things that actually make these things successful. Try building a simple service that you can market. Try doing a bit of Facebook and Adwords ads (you can get free coupons for starting out.) Look at the data and make changes to those ads to make them more effective. Get users, get feedback. Who knows, you might actually make some money at it.<p>Personally, I have have an internal clash between my geek side which wants to learn new things and play with shiny toys vs my practical side which wants for that time to be spent building something that is useful that I might be able to sell. Then when I start to commit to building, I know that I need to resist the urge to start coding and instead need to do work on validating the idea and reaching potential customers. Then when it comes time to throw up a web presence I need to resist breaking out the editors and frameworks and instead just push the &quot;install Wordpress&quot; button or something similarly quick and simple.<p>So, I would say, keep it practical. Learn what you need in the pursuit of creating value rather than learning to code with something for the sake of learning a different way to code something. I think you will find that there is more to making you a good engineer than just writing better code. If selling isn&#x27;t your thing right now, then find an open source project to contribute to. With the right project, not only will you provide needed help, but you could also help boost your profile and attract notice of the people you would be looking to for job.<p>When you only have 24 hours in a day (and much less of that to dedicate to your craft) then it&#x27;s best to get as much overlap as you can.<p>Oh, and go read through the endless other posts on Hacker News which have asked the same question. There are some great threads out there with information which won&#x27;t be reproduced in this thread.",1380200631

It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve thought about, but I&#x27;m 33, and at some point you have to accept your skill set and focus on your strengths. If I was 23, I would probably try to learn programming.<p>That sort of talk usually prompts a bunch of people to say - hey - you can teach yourself to be quite decent in just 6 months! Possibly true - but that requires a lot of spare time that I don&#x27;t have.

It was a great way to chat about work and trivia to other people doing similar jobs, whether I had met them or not - a sort of online &quot;water-cooler&quot; I guess or a more visible IRC.  In fact, I remember describing how to use it as &quot;sign up, follow interesting people, talk to strangers&quot;.<p>But now it&#x27;s much less about the conversations (I only really converse with the people I know in real-life, so it becomes a sort of public text-messaging).  Instead, it&#x27;s become a broadcast medium - communication is much more one-way and because of that, the number of retweets you get for your &quot;pithy insight&quot; becomes all the more important.",1380200500

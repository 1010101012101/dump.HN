He sent a picture of the CD and the receipt to the lawyer and explained the whole situation to him. He didn't hear back from the lawyer after that, and assumed that he had decided to back out (because really, it'd make <i>sense</i>). Fast-forward to almost a year later and the police show up on his door to confiscate the laptop.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/aki.w.nylund/posts/10151139041245079"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/aki.w.nylund/posts/1015113904124507...</a> (though obviously this won't be of much use to anyone who doesn't understand Finnish)<p>EDIT: I decided to translate some relevant parts of the Facebook post. I initially thought of translating the whole thing, but frankly the original text is rather badly written, which makes it pretty painful to translate.<p><i>Okay then, what follows will be a long and exhaustive tale in regards to my earlier status post.</i><p><i>Everything started about a year ago - my daughter asked where she could listen to some of the songs from the latest album of her favorite artist Chisu, since she hadn't saved up enough money to buy the album yet (but her friends at school already had it, apparently).</i><p><i>It was a Saturday evening and I was leaving for work, slightly behind the schedule as usual, so I quickly showed a couple different search engines that my daughter could use and told what keywords to look for. The next day my daughter told me she did find some songs, but that they ""didn't work"". And apparently she had managed to even ""download"" something, but that only resulted in errors on the computer screen. I couldn't keep watching all this pain pour out from my little girl, so we marched to the closest supermarket and I bought her the CD from this top Finnish artist.</i><p><i>Fast-forward to Spring and I get an e-mail from some attorney, claiming that I had illegally distributed a musical record on The Pirate Bay. As a result, I'd have to pay 600 (SIX HUNDRED EUROS) in charges to a specified account (the e-mail actually had an account number in it?!) and sign an NDA so that I wouldn't be able to tell anyone (or anyt</i>hing<i>) about these charges or the reason for them. The first impression I had was that this had to be some sort of Nigerian prince -type scam, but after checking the attachments and looking up the ""attorney's"" background, I fired a quick e-mail back that basically said ""What in the fuck is this thing about?""</i><p><i>Unfortunately, the answer didn't tell me anything new - just repeated the same ""pay 600 and sign the NDA, or this will go to court"" from the first mail. After that, I realized that this was probably connected to my daughter googling Chisu and managing to download some songs (that didn't work) and it was probably some kind of ""trap"" set up by a record label, my ISP and the police. I sent another e-mail to the attorney detailing the likely chain of events that could have happened here and attached two pictures along with it: one of the purchased CD and another of two concert tickets for a Chisu gig that I was going to attend with my daughter.</i><p><i>[...]</i><p><i>When I didn't hear any answer from the lawyer, I figured that even he must have some common sense and had decided to drop the case in favor of some ""real"" criminal deals.</i>",1353585136

The possibility for mistake is very high, which will certainly throw the target user of his/her tracks.</i><p>I disagree.<p>In the Netherlands, the driving exam includes being able to accelerate from a standstill while facing uphill. On first glance, this is ridiculous, since virtually all of the Netherlands is flat (and by that I <i>entirely</i> flat). It is a big hassle and hampers learning, because driving instructors have to drive long detours just to get to a city's single 5 meter long sloped road. More learning time is wasted, because there's a queue before that slope, entirely made up of other driving students (not kidding!).<p>However, at second glance, you realize that learning this useless thing is great because it allows you to do more with your car than the absolute basics. For example, I can take a car holiday abroad or queue in parking garages without getting nervous about how that thing with the hand break worked again.<p>It's similar for programming. As these tutorials are clearly meant for learning C# as a first programming language, immediately giving the user tools that do some of the hard work for them hampers their learning, because it is difficult for them to separate between the programming language concept and its corresponding tool support.<p>By learning the concepts independently from the tool (both language constructs and compiler toolchain concepts), the learner gets a more general understanding of what's going on.<p>Need to do Go later? Ah, a compiler, I know what that is.<p>Need to do Ruby later? Ah, no worries, I've done without autocomplete before, and oh, hey, classes and methods!",1353584897

Purists may say these are not ""property"" but massive dollars have been paid for the rights to own them and there will be huge resistance, not to mention constitutional objections, over any idea that these suddenly should be rendered worthless by legislative action.<p>It is the same problem you have with an transistion. This was studied a lot in economics, specially around the socialist transistion.<p>One view is this, pay out the benefiters of the old system just so you can get the institutional change.

How do I know this? A simple example is the Iraq war. One doesn't need to be a genius to understand the immorality and illegality of that war before it started. After it became <i>fact</i> that the ""reasons"" for starting the war were complete bullshit, what did the American public do? Nothing, we did absolutely nothing. Patriot act, escalation of the Afghanistan war, drone strikes killing innocent civilians, targeted assassinations of American citizens, indefinite detention, etc. All these actions, and more, by government are just as bad or even worse than 9/11.",1353583193

I honest don't feel like I've ""worked"" in the conventional sense since I've been back.<p>There are a lot of things you have to deal with which are unexpected. Finishing a project and realising you might not see the people you've worked with again ( especially if they've been great people to work with) is depressing.<p>There are times when it can also be lonely. I'm fairly lucky in that I'm currently living with my parents and so there's normally someone around.<p>In the periods between finding work ( where technically you're unemployed ) it is easy to get depressed and wonder whether you're doing the right thing. Having something else to focus on at the same time, be it a side project, or indeed finding more work is a must.<p>The biggest benefit is the freedom. Yes I might have work to do, but I can ( for most clients ) do it from where ever I want to do it. If I need a break from the parents, no problem I move my office to the girlfriends for a week. If I want a change of scenery, no problem I just pack my laptop up and I'm good to go!<p>The second benefit is the amount you learn. I now a much greater understanding of business. Tax, VAT, National insurance, invoices, marketing, chasing payments and how companies operate.<p>Not to mention the technical benefits of freelancing. I've taught myself backbone.js worked with node.js. Played with Symfony, Silex entered ( and come second in ) coding competitions, taught myself some AWS basics. All things I probably wouldn't have had the ability to do if I was working for someone else.<p>All in all the last six months have definitely been a positive experience in my life!",1353582654

Health insurance, matching 401k contributions, and various miscellaneous other perks are actually quite valuable. So you really have to take these things into account when you set your rates.<p>The other big difference is that a salaried job means a regular paycheck, no matter how busy you might be in any given month. But there can be a lot of downtime between billable hours freelancing so that's another potential dent in your income.<p>Personally I prefer to bid a fixed price instead of an hourly rate for a project. This makes it that much more important to consider your initial estimate carefully but it also eliminates a lot of micro-accounting and haggling over how much a single hour is worth.<p>You also have to be careful not to take on more work than you can handle. Unlike a regular job there's no hard ceiling on how much you can make in a month but it's easy to get in over your head this way.<p>So far I'm really enjoying the freedom and variety of freelancing but I think a regular job is easier in a lot of ways.",1353582417

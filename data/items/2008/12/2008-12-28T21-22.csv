So many newspapers are going the way of the Auk, it's nice to see the Times start to offer some compelling offerings to developers.<p>Newspapers have an immense amount of long tail content, but most of them don't have a clue that their old content is valuable.  I'm excited to see that the Times is starting offer API's to let developers play with some of that long tail content.<p>The movie reviews API is really just a start.  They also have a tags API, and they say that they're working on a search API on this page:  <a href=""http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/timestags_api"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/timestags_api</a>",1230501433

The point is: software and hardware constraints limit your flexibility, and Naggum's argument that ""a good engineer works around those constraints"" is true if you have a fixed problem to solve and a lot of time, but it's not when rapid prototyping, which is what most of us should be doing. He says that no one should need a 64-bit CL (in 2002); I took his line back to make a crummy newspapery punchline, which turns out to be false as well.<p>Stupid penchant for the dramatic.",1230500926

So I bought my latest computer thinking: I've got 1000 times more processing power than <i>necessary</i>, so why buy a top-of-the-line computer? Why care about the mere factor of 2 that I could get for an extra 2000 bucks?<p>What happens is this: today I had to solve software mini-problem #403 to put in experiment #14. I coded the naive O(n^2) algorithm, and damn it, it started paging, and performance crashes. I can't finish the experiment, unless I spend a few days looking up the right way to do it, O(log(n)); implementation, debugging, screams.

Most importantly, because Jekyll is restricted to Liquid for scriptability, it is safe to run server-side. Jekyll also processes non-Jekyll (plain HTML) sites unchanged, whereas Webby refuses to run at all without a config file. Jekyll also relies more heavily on conventions to reduce the organizational overhead of the maintainer. Webby is a great system, and I'd like to pull over some features from it, but I will do so under the philosophy and adaptations of Jekyll. Besides, if you like how Webby works, then you can use it to generate a site and push that to GitHub, just like Webby intends for you to do!",1230499147

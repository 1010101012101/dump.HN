221603,comment,221524,221552,0,0,ra,,,"There's two parts to the question.<p>1. How does senthil.com get to my server
2. How does my server know what to do with senthil.com<p>1. Can only be done by the domain owner. You need to instruct them to either:
a) Point the domain to your nameservers (in which case you'll need to configure a DNS server, in this case the myDNS suggestion is a good one). or<p>b) Have the domain owner setup an A record, pointing to our servers IP address (I assume you already have a dedicated IP - you'll need one).<p>Question 2, how does your server know what to do with it's traffic?<p>Well HTTP includes a HOST Header, which represent the hostname the user types into their URL bar.<p>You'll need to look for this, and direct them to the appropriate mini-site.<p>One way, as someone pointed out, is using Apache. So, you could either write out apache conf files and trigger reloads, or write some code in your app that looks at this header.<p>Hope this helps.",1213857313

And you could take someone's ID and put it on the site and communicate with that person.  Seemed like a roundabout way of just walking up to the person and saying ""hello my name is E"".<p>But to answer your question, a hardware-aided webapp could take off if it was backed by the right ""webapp"". If facebook, linkedIn, Match, etc. came out with a hardware (although why wouldn't you just write an iPhone app nowadays), that facilitated physical social networking then it might work.  Although IMO, people still like to keep a difference between their online and offline lives.<p>We are going to see a large numbers of mobile social networking companies in the next few years. It is the only logical next step for social networks, to go from in front of computers to location aware.",1213857309

If you want, you can do the request yourself to their current ISP, to update the domain's DNS, if they're keeping their email with the ISP.  If they don't, and you're controlling their email, too, go with Google's hosted email.<p>Now, this unknown domain is coming to your IP address.  If you're using apache, set up the domain to go to the redirected domain.  Easy way to do that is to set up a server alias, or have a virtual host that answers for everything:<p><VirtualHost *:80>
</VirtualHost><p>One way to do it, at least.",1213856172

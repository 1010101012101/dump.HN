So there is no external source of pressure, it's just the carriages moving and 'drafting' in each others wake.<p>There will still be resistance though, both from the walls as well as leakage between the carriage and the walls (there can't be a really good seal there or the friction between the carriage and the wall would become too large, and since the wall is stationary and the carriage is moving very fast this friction is likely sizeable).",1353495238

Make it concise and professional.<p>- When facing a blank page, one copywriting technique I've come up with is to make a list of all your features, and then next to each write the benefit. Now flip each around and write a sentence matching the ""get benefit x from feature x."" Group and edit from there.<p>- ""Who said that the desktop was dead?"" is too defensive when the desktop should be one of your selling points. You may not read about it on HN, but many people prefer desktop software over web based and mobile tools. And many prefer one-time purchases to ongoing subscriptions.<p>- There is very little text for search engines to crawl. At the very least, add a blog and start writing about CRM and related topics.<p>- You need an About page. People want to know who they are buying from.<p>- You should have a privacy policy as well.<p>- Cannot order more than 1 license at a time. E-junkie is a good interim solution for selling via PayPal.<p>- Why is there a link to Mixpanel in the footer? I'd remove it.<p>- The video is full screen and blurry at my monitor's resolution. Also, if you're creating a screencast without sound, you need to use text bubbles so viewers can follow along.<p>- Why does the Support link go to another site? A simple contact form would be better than taking visitors off site.<p>- Chrome gives a security warning for the download. You should get a real digital certificate as opposed to self signing. K Software (<a href=""http://codesigning.ksoftware.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codesigning.ksoftware.net/</a>) sells code signing certs for a relatively low cost.<p>- The installation has no instructions. Unzipping and running the setup file may seem obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people would get tripped up by this. Technically challenged people have money, and they do buy software.<p>- The download isn't very fast. It looks like you're deploying the entire DevExpress library.

At the proposed speeds (~300km/h) and distances (600km), this becomes a lot, and higher pressures (if my quick calculations are right) lead to higher energy requirements through higher air density.<p>In a vacuum, this friction would not exist.

If you're going to accuse someone of 'cheating' or otherwise rigging a benchmark, maybe you should at least do a proper benchmark yourself, or figure out how they cheated?<p>EDIT: Some basic digging reveals that this is using web workers, and V8's profiler does't record samples for web workers. It appears to be much slower in the current Release build of Chrome than it is in Canary, so whatever is causing it to be slow in V8 is actively being worked on by Chrome's developers.<p>Unfortunately Firefox's profiler only profiles the main thread as well. Furthermore the mandelbrot demo doesn't work right in Aurora or Nightly, so uh, yeah.<p>Given the use of workers, one guess would be that IE10 offers a much faster implementation of postMessage, making it cheaper to send the rendered pixel data back from the workers when it's done. Another obvious candidate would be a much faster implementation of putImageData for rendering the pixels to the canvas. A third candidate would be the use of something that IE10's JIT optimizes that V8 doesn't and Firefox struggles with slightly. Try/catch would be an obvious one; floats would be another.<p>The code for the demo is there, and it's got comments, so if you really think they're cheating, read it.

No matter how it's worded, your current agreement with your employer is actually something like: ""We agree that you will make mistakes and learn on the job. In return for this we will pay you peanuts"". If they wanted a senior developer, they should be paying for one.<p>It's also important to point out that the mistakes you make now will play a big part in <i>making</i> you a senior developer. If you're putting yourself out of your comfort zone often enough you should be make plenty of mistakes on a weekly basis. It's nice if like you say, you catch them before your boss/clients do, but I wouldn't beat yourself up too much if you don't.<p>> Your wage is shitty.... or can't eat for a few days<p>Leave. Even with only six months of experience you're probably worth at least double what you're getting paid now. That a <i>developer</i> can't eat, in this market, is truly fucking ridiculous.<p>> Get used to being the go to guy for all the boring work, no one wants to sit there and refactor spaghetti code or build yet another custom joomla module<p>Refactoring spaghetti code doesn't go away when you become a senior developer, and it's a massively important skill to build up. Most non-trivial projects on big systems will require that you do this. I know it doesn't feel like you're learning anything, but <i>reading</i> code is a hugely important task that junior developers need to do more of (as opposed to just <i>writing</i> it).<p>The more you do this, the better you will get at understanding big systems quickly. Learn this now, do it at future clients 1, 2, 3, and 4. By the time you do it at client 5, you'll be so good at it that they'll think you're some sort of prodigy (so get paid accordingly!).<p>> Slow down at the start,... your boss will notice your apparent lack of progress<p>Who cares? If your boss has a problem with your progress he should let you know and you should work together to improve it. Also: Leave!<p>> Always be early, never be late. Your boss blah blah...<p>Personally I like coming in at the crack of dawn and leaving <i>very</i> early. I know other wickedly good developers who prefer turning up at 11 and leaving at 8. Non-developers don't get this, but it's fine. As long as you're delivering results and are available for any in-person rituals, no one should really care what time you arrive/leave.<p>> Arrogance is bad.<p>You say that now, wait a few years. When you've surpassed your heros in terms of skill/knowledge and spend most of your time watching other developers wrap themselves into webs of complexity for no good reason (and then have to clean up after them), then tell me not to be arrogant. A strongly worded opinion, arrogant or not, has demonstrably saved <i>months</i> of work and oodles of money for clients down the line.<p>> starting sentences with ""actually, I think"" or ""No, that's wrong..."" will land you in the shit, especially in front of a client<p>Bzzzt, wrong again! Expressing my opinion in front of clients, even as a junior developer, has consistently been a positive experience for everyone involved, including my boss's at the time. ""No, that's wrong"" is admittedly a little strong, but it really depends on the content. ""No, that's wrong, the google search algorithm works like X so you'll probably have better results doing activity Y"" or ""No, that's wrong, if instead we make it a RESTful API we get the following 3 benefits..."" is a hell of a lot more useful to everyone in the room than you just sitting in a corner being demure.<p>> Your boss wants to appear to be an all singing, all dancing super coder<p>I don't think I like your boss very much.<p>Based on the attitude you've displayed in this post, by any metric you're probably better than you think you are.

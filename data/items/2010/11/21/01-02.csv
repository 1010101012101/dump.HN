Union-breaking is practically a science these days, it's neither expensive nor difficult, especially against a workforce with no ability to mount a meaningfully disruptive strike. It appears to me that there simply isn't the political will to do it. The teaching unions make more noise than parents and students, so they win. We return to my basic thesis, that we don't care as much about education as we'd like to think.<p>If you just fire the worst 10% every year, you just make teaching less attractive. As it stands, teaching is sufficiently low-status, poorly paid and unpleasant that the only people who go into it are a rare few who really want to teach and a majority who aren't competent enough to do anything else. You can't just fire bad teachers, you need to recruit good ones. For the moment, only a martyr or an idiot would decide to teach.",1290304431

Then do it again next year.<p>That only works if you're good at recognizing the bottom 10% and have tight anti-cheating controls.  Otherwise, things will go straight to hell.  Also, you're neglecting the fact that it'll destroy cooperation among the teachers, because it turns things into a ""it's either him or me, and it's not going to be me"" scenario.  Neither effect is conductive to a better or more effective school environment.<p>While the idea of firing bad teachers has a lot of merit, handling it in such a way is a terrible idea.  That's the sort of quick fix bad managers come up with and one of the ways bad managers can help destroy an entire organization.<p>But it's a lot easier to give out fixes like these than it is to understand problems, so such ideas are remarkably prevalent.

Remember back to when you implemented a user-space memory allocator. One of the most straightforward algorithms is to use power-of-two blocks with varying coalescing algorithms.  The problem that you get with your style and this malloc implementation is that, since you need to store memalloc metadata in the block (probably), each block has just slightly less than a power of two space, which means a block request for a power of two will always waste an enormous amount of space by pushing up to the next power of two block size.<p>Now, this ""power of two allocation is best"" misconception is so widespread that many memory allocators actually purposefully account for the case where the memory allocation is a power of two and make their block sizes just slightly larger.

As others have mentioned, different systems are better for different situations, but if you're talking about easy to use by non-tech people to manage an informational website, I have found Concrete5 to be better than the rest by leaps and bounds.<p>The reason it works well for these kinds of sites is that it aligns with non-technical users' mental model of their website. Non-tech users don't think of their site as a template that displays content from a database, but rather as a bunch of pages with stuff on the pages. Most CMS's require users to go to an administrative back-end which shows a hierarchical sitemap of pages -- an abstract representation of their site -- and this is VERY confusing to most people. Concrete5, on the other hand, is based on the concept of content blocks on a page. So to edit a page, you GO to the page and add/edit blocks of content there. The blocks thing is great because it allows for different ""mini-UI's"" for different kinds of content. For example, to edit regular text, a standard WYSIWYG editor works fine, but if you want to add an image or a youtube video or a navigation list or a google map, it doesn't work as gracefully -- the block system means that different kinds of content can get different editing UI's specifically tailored for that type of content (for example, a youtube video just gets a textbox to paste in the URL, or a google map block presents fields for addresses, marker options, etc.).<p>There are many web-based CMS's that utilize this approach -- Weebly (a YC company), WebVanta, SnapPages, Yola, etc. -- but I haven't come across an open-source install-yourself CMS other than Concrete5 which works this way.",1290303567

(Hospital bills, etc..)<p>Apparently he cost the state 1 Million Dollars over 10 years.<p>So $20,000 per year $100,000/per year?  Suddenly that low end guarantee is a serious cost savings.<p>Now certainly - ""Murray"" wouldn't get away with costing <i>ONLY</i> $20,000 per year ... but in a safe, (partially) supervised area, he'd have cost a lot less than $100k.<p>Gladwell also mentions that the data shows ""most people"" won't leech off these programs forever.  Most have an innate drive to want to improve themselves.<p>Some will but actually - it's probably still cheaper than ""Murray"".<p>I am 100% in favor of a program like this - in principle.<p>Now try and introduce it at a Texas town hall meeting :) With FOXNEWS cameras in attendance.",1290302711

The problem (with many enterprise solutions) is that it is very advanced and not easy to use at all for new users. I would almost say that training is a must for such a solution. I feel pretty sure that with better usability in focus, it could have been almost a killer app for larger sites.<p>2) EZ:\nTaken from the name, EZ should be easy to use, it`s not. This is just another solution fallen into the ""Enterprise"" trap, instead of focusing on the users that actually have to work with it, they focus on the bosses and persons with the money, in order to sell in the system. The solution itself is relatively plain but you can not simply log in a place and select ""new article"", instead it is typically creating objects here and there.<p>3) Wordpress:\nFinally a system that has the user in focus, the system is designed for people NOT being geeks. Anybody will without any training be able to login and create some content. It is plain and simple but in the same time it gives the user the needed information and not everything else.<p>There is a good reason Microsoft has decided to close their blogging services and rather move all their users over to Wordpress.<p>So to conclude:\nI put Wordpress on first place, with the possibility of Polopoly going to first place for larger solutions if they could get their user interface in order.<p>* I guess some of you would say that Wordpress is not a CMS,in that case i do wonder... What is the difference between Wordpress and a ""real"" CMS? :)",1290302229

It wouldn't be remotely difficult.<p>Massively increase pay for teachers, tripling or quadrupling pay at every level. Mandate a specific postgraduate qualification and a statutory minimum of continuing professional development. Recruit only the best and the brightest, specifically seeking out graduates from the best universities. Advertise teaching as a career on prime-time television. Put Obama on The Daily Show and Oprah to talk about the importance of teaching. In short, a concerted effort to make teaching every bit as prestigious as law or medicine. After a few years, require every teacher in the country to reapply for their own job. Relative to the Military or Social Security budgets, the cost would barely even register on the balance sheet.<p>We could quite easily live in a world where Asian parents push their kids into teaching, where Yale and Harvard vie to be the best school of education, where teaching is seen as a first choice rather than a last resort.<p>We don't, because we don't really care. We pretend that education matters, but really it's one of those things that you're supposed to care about but most people don't, like the environment or human rights. We don't care whether college students learn anything, only that they get a suitably prestigious certificate. We don't care whether high school graduates can meaningfully participate in society, only that they can pass the standardised tests, whatever they might be.<p>It is practically self-evident that we don't care about teaching. We all know that the current system is failing, but we aren't prepared to do the obvious things that would actually rescue it.

They do patch the kernel, but they exploit it at startup and do dynamic patching using dynamic methods that work on any version. There is no hex editing. For adding to frameworks, they use a similar method to LD_PRELOAD on Linux. No in-binary patching ever happens.<p>Poor source code? If you mean ""not much is released"", that's wrong, for example comex posts his kernel patching code at <a href=""http://github.com/comex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/comex</a> shortly after every release.<p>.git directories? No idea where that comes from.<p>So, here's what a jailbreak /does/ do: it evades the codesigning mechanisms on the device, and installs a file that does the same on boot. It then injects some code into the kernel, which does dynamic patching to remove the code signature verification checks. After that, it untars a basic *nix setup, with GNU coretools and the Cydia application, and moves the built-in applications to the larger partition (to make space for additional system components). Want to install a ""tweak""? It installs MobileSubstrate, a tool that loads itself into processes via DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES (similar to LD_PRELOAD on Linux), and then injects whatever other packages you have installed using that. This allows dynamic patching of whatever we want, and you don't hex-edit or modify a single binary.<p>So I'm not sure where you got that impression, but it's pretty much patently wrong.",1290301758

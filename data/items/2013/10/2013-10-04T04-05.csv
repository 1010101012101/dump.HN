6493793,comment,6493173,6493173,2,0,asveikau,,,"Interesting quote from Ozzie:<p>> &quot;The PC-centric/server-centric model has accreted simply immense complexity,&quot;<p>This is presented as an insight.  There is so little context given here, so maybe I&#x27;m just missing something, but it sounds much more like bullshit to me.<p>What exactly is <i>less complex</i> about &quot;post-PC&quot; or &quot;post traditional server&quot;?  On the client, minding battery life and constantly dealing with connection loss is much more complex than an always-powered, always-connected PC.  On the server front, managing VM instances is in many ways more complex than just running a single server, or a smaller set of them.  People add these complexities because they give them something in return.  But it is adding complexity, let us not deny it.<p>I never followed Ozzie too deeply, but this style of throwing around programmer jargon to make an all-around &quot;nothing&quot; point seems to be his style.  I still remember hearing him say something along the lines of &quot;RSS is the Unix pipe of the web&quot;.  I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt when I heard that, to stretch my mind somewhat to believe that is actually a thing...  But let&#x27;s face it, the analogy is nonsense.",1380862763

6493784,comment,6492380,6492380,1,0,army,,,"This isn&#x27;t that surprising.  It&#x27;s common knowledge in the academic community that:<p>* There are bogus open access journals which exist solely to make money from author fees.<p>* There are bogus conferences that follow a similar business strategy.<p>* There are lower-quality journals and conferences that do not attract many top-quality submissions, so tend to have a lower barrier for acceptance: you might get work that&#x27;s rigorous and unexciting, work that&#x27;s exciting but preliminary or rough around the edges, or work that&#x27;s neither rigorous nor interesting.<p>* Peer reviews vary widely in quality, from being thorough
 to overly critical and nit-picking to being cursory.  This is extremely frustrating to many people, but is hardly an undiscussed issue.  One particular problem is that more junior reviewers are often reluctant to criticize a paper unless they&#x27;re very confident in their understanding, either due to it being slightly outside of their core expertise, or due to convoluted presentation: it&#x27;s easier to assume it&#x27;s correct than to go out on a limb criticizing something.<p>I would say that being published in a peer reviewed article is just the start of a gauntlet that any serious scientific claim has to run, regardless of the quality of peer review.  Plenty of important work has started out as being extremely controversial: even once it got published people didn&#x27;t necessarily think it was right.  The consensus does continue to evolve.<p>I&#x27;ve never met a scientist who will believe something just because it&#x27;s in a peer reviewed article.",1380862596
6493783,comment,6493461,6493728,8,0,anologwintermut,,,"Because, if this article is correct[0], his refusal to obey a court order is the only reason the FBI made him hand over private keys.<p>The story is the FBI asked for Snowden&#x27;s emails and correspondence. Lavabit said they would not hand over the information(but admitted they had the technical capability ... it was server side encryption after all). Only after that refusal did the FBI start taking more drastic action.<p>This is, if that story is true, about on par with a Bank complaining that the FBI ransacked the safe all their safety deposit boxes were stored in. Expect the bank neglects to mention that the only reason the FBI had to break open the safe and be put in the position of being able easily break open all the safety deposit boxes was because the Bank failed to to hand over one box when given a valid court order.<p>This is particularly problematic in Lavabit&#x27;s case because a major cornerstone of the argument against the NSA&#x27;s warrantless surveillance is that there are legal means to compel access to data when it is actually necessary and that those means make it totally illegal to do what the NSA was doing. This is really a hard point to argue when those means don&#x27;t work because other&#x27;s thumb their nose at the law as well.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/10/lavabit_unsealed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/10/lavabit_unsealed/</a>",1380862589

Lately I&#x27;ve been reflecting on the work of Dr. Carl Hart of Columbia University.  He&#x27;s a neuroscientist focused on the science of addiction, especially for crack and methamphetamine.<p>Guess what?  He&#x27;s African American.
Guess what?  He has family members who are severely addicted.
Guess what?  He has found that 80%+ of people who take meth or crack are NOT addicts, and that a strong incentive like $20 or good social structure can be just enough to overcome the desire to take drugs.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, he&#x27;s living proof of why we need diversity in science.  Who better to study addiction than one who has seen it and lived it first hand?<p>More info: <a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/story/298365-drugs-neuroscience-and-current-drug-policy-according-dr-carl-hart//"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wnyc.org/story/298365-drugs-neuroscience-and-curr...</a>",1380862056

Maybe I have been using the word incorrectly for a long time, but I never thought it just means &quot;potential target who has never heard about my company and won&#x27;t know what hit them if I called them up&quot;.<p>In that case, I see a problem with your product and pricing. You see, if I still have to do the cold calling in-house, you&#x27;re just offering me email addresses. Those may or may not be mostly from my target demographic, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s worth 2000k a month if I still have to pay sales people to do the actual work on top of that.<p>My suggestion for you would be to either drastically lower your prices and be clearer about what your customers are getting, or - much better - offer them the whole sales workflow in one package.",1380859621

IMO, a rockstar designer should take more stake in a company than a rockstar developer. Look at Apple, Im not so sure if their designer(s) took much credit for what they did in turning around that company (Unless Jobs designed the ipods/iphones/macbooks himself, which I doubt).""<p>With Jobs's recent passing, the last sentence is a statement that has plenty of evidence and testimony to argue either way.

One is getting a loan, but I'm quite adverse to the thought of putting myself in such debt, especially with other responsibilities like having a roof over my head coming in first priority.<p>Another is crowdsourcing, but the problem with that is that I'm worried if enough people hear about my idea, someone with bigger pockets and more connections than me may steal my idea and launch it before me.

In what way did <i>they</i> not break it?<p>I understand and admire Debian's commitment to cleanly built, working software. Within that context I also understand that rubygems is a big, scary unknown. That said, if the only way to solve the problem is to hack up rubygems until it no longer works as intended, the only real answer is to not ship rubygems within Debian. It just flat out has to be left in ""here be dragons"" land.

A good design might attract the user on the first, but if the backend sucks; adios muchacos.<p>I have a feeling that he doesn't understand that to be a truly great designer, one has to have a great knowledge of the backend programming as well. Design borders dont end at the front. They strech deeply into all the lines of code. And for a product to work nad become great, designers must become engineers and vice versa so that they both get best of both worlds.<p>I suggest the author to look more into 37signals, and how theyre designers operate.

At least the ones who are designers. These days there are about as many people who think they can call themselves designers as those who think they have the next big app idea.

Since I don't spend every second of the day monitoring my FB account, posts from real friends get pushed below the fold before the next time I login, and I miss them.<p>To make matters worse, FB has apparently disabled the Unlike button from the settings page that allows you to see all your likes in one dialog, which is apparently the closest thing to a bulk unlike available (you still have to click Unlike for each page, but at least they're all there in a convenient list).<p>So the only way to unlike stuff is apparently to visit each page, scroll down to the Unlike button in the bottom of the left menu, click it, then proceed to do the same for the next 1000+ pages.  Not.  I'm just switching over G+ instead.<p>Even with G+ I've made the mistake of subscribing to a bunch of shared circles, and there's an impedance mismatch between the topic of the circles, and the Public posts of the people in them.  Even if I subscribe to say, a Python Developers circle, I still get people's public posts of pictures of dinner last night, etc., that is just more noise.<p>At least G+ makes it easy to fix the problem via unsubscribing, but what they could really use is the ability to add filters to circles based on hashtags.  So if someone in my Python circle makes a public post that doesn't have #python, #pypy, #tornado, or some other python-related hastag that I've specified in my Python circle filter, that post won't show up in my feed.<p>But after having learned the hard way twice, I can guarantee I at least won't be adding more spammy businesses and whatnot to my G+ feed.",1320705299

They basically trawl job boards looking for new jobs, then take that one post and throw it up on 10 other sites with slightly reworded text so you can't do a simple Google search to find the original post.<p>4 months ago when I was job hunting, I came across 6 separate postings from 6 different companies, all advertising for the exact same position. It was incredibly aggravating, because this practice of reposting as many jobs as possible has clogged legitimate job boards to the point that a clear majority of job postings are from ""recruiters"". There's so much crap you have to wade through to get to any real postings, and that's how they operate. These companies basically impede your job search to the point that you are almost forced to go with them - unless you have patience, a strong dislike for recruiting agencies/agents, and maybe a network of professional acquaintances you can announce your availability to.<p>Thankfully I have the first two (not the network :( ), and have so far steered clear of recruiters when I find my jobs.<p>I don't want this to become a pages-long rant, so I'll make the rest short.<p>I do not know of job boards like Monster have methods to report spam from recruiters. Not only email spam (that I can easily deal with), but phone spam, especially when it's an Indian (it's ALWAYS Indian) recruiter calling me for an AWESOME 3-month opportunity in New Jersey (I'm in Texas).<p>Most American recruiters I've dealt with have the unfortunate tendency to overstate the salary range their hiring-mark is open to. One of the very few interviews I've had thanks to a recruiter went downhill quickly after I was told the salary range they were going for. This after 3 interviews that I thought had gone splendidly. I was more than a little pissed, and so was the hiring manager after I called him and explained to him exactly what had happened.<p>Long story short: I no longer entertain any recruiters whatsoever (unless it's an internal company recruiter, of course).",1320704502

3208409,comment,3207727,3208363,5,0,Maro,,,"You have to be careful here, as MongoDB and Cassandra use a different model of replication.<p>Cassandra does not perform replication/synchronization on a per command basis between the nodes. Roughly: the client writes to multiple nodes, which are mostly independent, so assuming client bandwidth is not the bottleneck, writing to W=2 nodes will not be much slower than W=1. In practice, since Cassandra's disk storage subsystem is also fast for writes, it's overall very fast at raw writes. (As in, fastest in my benchmarks.) The trade-off is that its replication model is eventual consistency, and reads are somewhat slowish. On the other hand, their model works well in a multi-datacenter environment (along with Riak).<p>MongoDB uses an asynchronous replication model. What seems to happen if you specify W=2 is that the master doesn't ACK the write to the client until one of the slaves has copied it off the master. In my measurements W=2 ran at a fixed ~30 writes/sec on EC2, which means this mode may as well not be there. (This W=2 performance problem was also verified by customers looking at MongoDB.)<p>If you look at my company's product, ScalienDB, it uses highly optimized synchronous replication model (Paxos) and a storage engine designed for that. It's actually faster running in W=3 mode than certain other NoSQLs in W=1 mode. My bet is that this is what enterprises are going to want if they're going to use a NoSQL as a primary-copy database.<p>(Test for youself, all products are open-source, it'll cost you less than $20 on AWS.)",1320704292

There are a lot of people in this thread debating the merits of the complaints and <i>most</i> doubt those merits. Even more people are not participating in this thread at all and you don't have a clue what they think. If they're anything like me, they thought ""another day, another complaint about product X."" and didn't draw any conclusions from this post.<p>You seem too convinced of your own greatness to seriously consider the possibility that maybe <i>most</i> people here are actually sensible and don't rush to judgments. To me, this post portrays you as an 18-year old that was the smartest in his highschool, but has yet to realize and accept just how awfully many people out there are smarter and wiser. God help the people around you if you're older than 28.",1320703356

To take a toy example, let's say that the entire economy consists of nothing but producing TVs, and that enough TVs are produced for each person to have one TV per year.<p>Now some massive productivity increase comes along and doubles output with the same workers. Now you're producing enough TVs for each person to have two TVs per year. Either the price of TVs will drop by 50%, or salaries will double. (Or half of the workforce will be fired....) Approximately. If everyone produces more then everyone has to be able to buy more, otherwise there's no reason to have the additional production in the first place.",1320703204

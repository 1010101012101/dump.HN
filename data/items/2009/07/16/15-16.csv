Things of this nature are more like the elements wrong within a brave new world; stupid mindless entertainment (after all, soma was described by him as ""all the benefits of alcohol and christianity, with none of the defects"").<p>""Dream in a pragmatic way."" - Huxley<p>...after all, we need only look near the end of his life to see what conclusions he drew of all this as to what we <i>ought to do</i>: ""In regard to man’s final end, all the higher religions are in complete agreement. The purpose of human life is the discovery of Truth, the unitive knowledge of the Godhead. The degree to which this unitive knowledge is achieved here on earth determines the degree to which it will be enjoyed in the posthumous state. Contemplation of truth is the end, action the means."" (thoughts on the perennial philosophy, after he went mystic)<p>huxley perhaps is not the name to invoke to defend human interests in triviality, or rejections of reason.<p>invoking a reminder of huxley's ideas works well for rejection of trivial banter, rejection of living life as efficient strife for the accomplishment of the superficial (like finding this girl), and the rejection of making ourselves slaves to technological progress while making no progress in our deep understandings of life (like having successful startups and never taking the time to ponder the cosmic whole).",1247759975

SEO used to be about manipulating search engine rankings -- having the word ""mortgages"" in white text on a white background 5000 times on all your pages, or building a giant link farm to inflate pagerank.<p><i>Now</i> it's about getting people to read content -- by creating content people like to read. I guess there's something to be said for appealing to smaller, less trendy groups (but that's part of SEO, too; the ROI on dominating obscure searches is often higher than for more mainstream searches, simply because a long search string is more likely to lead to a sale -- you Google [web design] (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=website+design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=website+design</a>) to learn about web design; you try [nyc website design firm] (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=nyc+website+design+firm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=nyc+website+design+firm</a>) when you're ready to hire, e.g., the company I work for).<p>The problem a lot of people have with SEO is that when they notice it, it's done badly.

Seriously, if it is a cold spring my friends will avoid me till the weather warms up.  Unfortunately I live in Illinois, and we have those times of year where frostbite is the natural result of barefoot.  So every winter I put on shoes :(.  This causes me to revert to heel walking (a natural result of shoes). Once the shoes come off it takes about 2 days to get back into midfoot walking. This seems to me to feel more natural, and my feet just sort of do it. I presume this will be similar for you, maybe not quite as fast, but I am certain your body will have walking instincts for barefoot styles.<p>HTH",1247759716

So you're gonna have tests for that, but the existence of a compiler and strong typing enforced by said compiler is not an excuse to avoid testing.  My tests check logic.  If I decide that User.to_string() needs to return ""User: Brian Hogan <brianhogan@example.com>"" then I write a test for that first. Then I go make to_string() do what that test says. Seems trivial, but no compiler's going to catch if I implement that wrong.<p>That example seems trivial.. but here's a real example: I had a very complex health insurance system I helped write. A mistake in the formula could have cost someone thousands of dollars in premiums.  We asked the end users to give us names of people and their health scores.  ""Jon, with this height, weight, bmi, and all this other criteria should get a score of x""<p>Writing the test cases first helped out a ton. Even with a compiled strong typed language, I still would have needed tests to make that work.<p>And it's been six months since then and I've heard of no issues with the calculation routine.

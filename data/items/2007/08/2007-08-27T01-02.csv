A house that somebody lives in will always look worse than a house that has been prepared to look its absolute swankest, with every dust particle removed and every pillow fluffed. It makes more sense to talk of ""full enjoyment"" as a range rather than a point. To me, things like dulled metal surfaces would not be out of that range, if the house is designed well. If minor things like that put it outside the range, then it's a bad house. <p>Maybe there is something to that ""essential character"" business after all. Worn things are pleasant, and I think there is a reason. They put you at ease because they tell you that they've been used, and it's OK to use them. Shiny things seem fragile and distant.",1188179654

I've tried to emphasize more of the social aspect of the site, but we're still wondering if there's anything that could be emphasized a little better.  I've tried to keep the process of actually managing what you're accomplishing as simple as possible.<p>What would you like to see?  What would make the site useful or entertaining for you?  I'm at your command.",1188178883

46841,comment,46400,46575,0,0,nickb,,,"I don't think that having a FB profile is important. I don't have one myself (for many reasons, privacy being the first one) but I see why so many people have one and I would never fault anyone for using FB. As for your second question, I think it really depends. If both of the candidates are ""equal"" in your mind (and I have to admit that I've never had that problem), FB can both help and harm. It all depends on who you are and what you have in there :).",1188178657

For now it just has some features from highrise, but this will change in a few months. <p>It's public so if you're interested, you (or anyone else) can let me know what you feel needs to be changed or added to meet your needs",1188178650

There are a few pioneers like Wright and van der Rohe whose fame is well-deserved, and then hoards of half-conscious imitators shouting ""let's make Facebook for, uh... iguana owners!"".  But I suppose that makes it just like anything else in life.",1188178502

46835,comment,46736,46822,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I agree with you that a good house needs to withstand age,  but ""showing off"" that your house withstands age while denying the full enjoyment of the aesthetic experience of the house seems like a foolish trade off to me.  I argue that the experience inside the house is the top priority in this context, not the sub sub feature that it ages well.

Google indexes websites, websites do not exist to be indexed by google.<p>If another website will take wikipedias place in terms of quality and wikipedia will degrade then wikipedia will find that people will start linking to that other site. In time this will lead google to increase the ranking for these pages.<p>Remember that google indexes <i>PAGES</i> not <i>DOMAINS</i>.<p>So for every page that the new wikipedia contains that the old one does not the forked one gets right of way. It's not like wikipedia started off with millions of pages and lots of backlinks. The new project would be a fork in the open source sense, a new name with a fresh start and a chance to show how it can be done better. Its ability to lure people away from the 'old' wikipedia is what makes it go, the editors will determine its success, not google.<p>And the chances of that success are simply a factor of how much time they put in collectively to make it different and better than the original.",1259152575

Even if no new features where added to another Java application, adding closures to ease the maintenance of existing code is justifiable enough.<p>Like it or not Java is the enterprise language and Ruby, Scala, Haskel et.al. are not going to take that crown any time soon, just as it took Java a long time to supplant COBOL, one of them will have to grind it's way in inch by inch. The fact of the matter is that for what Java is intended for, it does a very good job so it is not in the same seat that COBOL was.<p>I dislike Java (from a personal enrichment perspective) as much as the next guy, but it is never too late to improve a language with such a useful feature, especially a language that is going to be the dominate language for the foreseeable future.",1259152291

961011,comment,960400,960980,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think HN drops votes selectively, most of the time it manages to hide the fact that it does to the voter. Personally I think this is rather childish but that's the way it works. (In my view if a function doesn't work you simply drop that part of the interface, not to give the user the impression that something has been done when in fact it hasn't. This is part of the 'secret sauce' of HN, so maybe the overall effect is positive, but I feel like I'm being treated like a child.).<p>About that 'one point':<p>1) not using a proper ORM:<p>ORMs have their place. In a project that does 'simple' stuff (ACID style) you can get away with using the ORMs
worldview to get through your day. The problems start when
you have to do stuff that the ORM does not provide for. As
soon as you hit that limitation you're in for a fun ride, mostly
because ORM data models were meant to be accessed through a
program writing the queries. To write queries that do complicated
stuff for database tables that have been created and maintained
through an ORM will get you bogged down pretty quickly. Assuming that you are even allowed to do so. So
to thoroughly research the use cases for your data before
committing to a specific ORM can save you a lot of time later.<p>In general I think this is a problem that relatively inexperienced
programmers face, they pick the first tool that <i>seems</i> to
cover all the bases and start working on the code, only to
run out of steam somewhere halfway in to the project, by
that time you've got a lot of effort invested in to that
particular solution and to abandon it gets harder with every
minute that you further invest.<p>The fact that the author has re-written this particular chunk of code 3 times now and still isn't satisfied is telling,
the lesson to learn here is not 'use a proper ORM', the 
lesson as far as I can see it is 'research your work
before committing to your tools'.<p>Experience will teach you that requirements change, they 
change all the time, there has never been a project of
any magnitude that did not have its requirements change
over the course of its deployment, and as a rule this
already surfaces during development.<p>So you plan ahead, you build for the future, not for the
simplistic view you have today. It will save you lots of
money and time later, your first rewrite then is a decade
off instead of a few months.<p>The rest of the 'mistakes' listed suffer from similar shortcomings in their 'lessons learned'.<p>That is why I have a problem with this posting, not because it is bad to learn from your mistakes.<p>I think this guy should work together with more experienced people that can guide him in the right direction, rather than to assume that because he's making some slow progress (5 years ??!) he is now in a position to present his wisdom.",1259152036
961010,comment,960850,960962,0,0,jsankey,,,"This is even more glaring in the flawed movie analogy.  Consumers of movies are not just paying for the experience of the movie.  The movie itself is the main distinguishing factor.  There is no ""perfect competition"" across all movies as the article seems to imply by limiting the differentiating factors to things surrounding the movie itself.",1259151976

It's just that their do their reasoning externally, ""out loud"".</i><p>That is not at all the definition of ""extrovert"" that I use. An extrovert to me is someone who is happy to speak up in social situations, jovial and engaging, socially adept.<p>I've never thought of extroversion as ""outloud logical progression"" or ""self-argument posing as argument"". Indeed that last one sounds rather like an introversion to me as it is ignoring the external stimulus to focus on the internal, a sort of outloud internalisation.",1259151964

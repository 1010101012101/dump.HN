A recent attempt to get sstp-client and NetworkManager-sstp working on CentOS 6.3 resulted in a long stompy walk when I couldn't get it to build without breaking the distribution due to dependency hell.

Those schools costs tens of thousands of dollars to attend to per semester but does not make you a better developer than having gone to a cheaper college.<p>There is no correlation between the amount of dollars you spend on your education and how educated you are. There is a correlation between having rich parents that can pay for it and going to an expensive school. But I wish people would stop perpetuating this myth about how a great school automatically makes their alumni great. The schools themselves aren't going to do it because expensive fees is what they live on. People who spent that kind of money aren't either because they gain a lot of free and undeserved opportunities from the reputation the school has. But we, the smart techies should know better.

It's the capital <i>city</i> of Taiwan, which has had de facto independence for over 60 years but is unrecognized by the UN as a country due to the fact that China carries a veto and will cut relations with any country that does recognize Taiwan.<p>Taiwan has <i>never</i> been part of the PRC (which is the country commonly referred to as ""China"").  Taiwan has a separate currency, democratic governance, a separate military and a separate national identity for virtually the entire populace except for a few graying nationalist soldiers.  Its ""standards"" as you put it are much closer to Japanese or Korean standards than they are to Chinese ones.<p>Furthermore, even going back before WWII, Taiwan was a Japanese colony, not Chinese.  You have to go all the way back to the Qing Dynasty before Taiwan was controlled by China.  Using that kind of reasoning, most of Eastern Europe would belong to the Austrian Monarchy.<p>Note: I've spent over 7 years living in Taiwan and also 2 years in Beijing.",1347018527

To be honest, before someone found out, a couple of years ago, most people never knew about the Braun products, while everybody knew about the iPod. Polaroid is a different example, since while Instagram is well known, Polaroid was also well known. \nBut again, this is Ok, and this is also Ok with Apple. There're vibrators that look like Apple devices, there're TV's, radios, alarm-clocks, calculators, that all look like Apple devices, and Apple doesn't care about it.  (Fun example: <a href=""http://www.megagadgets.de/mipad-taschenrechner.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.megagadgets.de/mipad-taschenrechner.html</a>)<p>They care if somebody copies their devices really close, and then goes into their market<p>Years ago, there was a small american company selling PC's that looked 99% like Macs (not Psystar). I forgot the name, but here Apple also went to the courtroom. Same problem here, these people copied not only their designs, but they copied really closely on products that competed directly with Apple's products in Apple's markets.<p>Apart from that, the Braun products are from the 70ties, and the Braun designed said he was flattered by Apple picking up where they left off.<p>Interestingly, Polaroid does exactly what you said: When somebody releases something that has the distinct Polaroid picture look, they threaten with a lawsuit. I experienced it up front: One of my apps was rejected from the app store because my pictures in there looked like Polaroids, and the rejection was in order to prevent me from getting sued by Polaroid, which seems to have happened before.",1347018504

This builds intuition which is much more long-term than memorization. Memorizing equations for an exam helps you for that exam only (typically). Being able to quickly derive the equation any time you need will help you forever. This is harder but only at first. You'll thank yourself.<p>As for the app, go for it!

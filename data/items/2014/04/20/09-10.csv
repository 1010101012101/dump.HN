It was an inexpensive, but loved, token as it was personal to her.<p>When we decided to get married, we approached several jewellers to make us a pair of wedding rings using the silver one as a template. Most &#x27;commercial&#x27; and many small jewellers didn&#x27;t have the skills or inclination to make the rings from scratch, preferring to suggest we bought a pair &#x27;off the page&#x27;, but eventually we found a local guy who&#x27;d just opened his first shop having followed his father into the trade after an &#x27;old school&#x27; apprenticeship - he&#x27;d just obtained the right qualifications to be classed as a proper jeweller and when we explained our idea he was positively enthusiastic about the project, so he hand-pierced and finished off two Celtic knots in 9ct gold (they had to be low-gold content to keep the rings tough enough to stay in shape with all the knotwork holes in them - but the metal type/content wasn&#x27;t important to us).<p>We were delighted, the young jeweller was thrilled that he had done a good job and also had a commission he could show off to other prospective clients in a photo portfolio. Apparently his father was also proud of his work.<p>After a couple of months we went to see the jeweller because we found the bands were pinching a little underneath our fingers and asked him if he would curve/narrow the backs; he replied that he would consider the work to be &#x27;finishing off&#x27;, so &#x27;no charge&#x27;, but how about he kept the small amount of gold he&#x27;d be removing. Fine by us.<p>So, 15 years on, we have two completely unique, hand made wedding rings that were crafted by someone with a real passion for his art. We have a &#x27;story&#x27; and love them for what they symbolize and not because they hit a price point (in fact they were much cheaper than factory stamped ones).",1397987719

7616329,comment,7615750,7616188,7,0,stormbrew,,,"Throwing some thoughts on this entire conversation from the perspective of someone who&#x27;s been using C++ for a long time:<p>One of the reasons why the C++ for (:) syntax above feels like such an improvement over the traditional iterator for loop is that it cuts out a lot of noise that&#x27;s the same for almost every container loop you ever do. The same objection could be raised as in another branch of this conversation, that you might have other kinds of ranges on an object, and I&#x27;ve even done that before (as obj.something_begin() and obj.something_end()). But even before ranged-for came it almost always turned out ugly and I regretted it.<p>If most uses of for in Rust call iter() (I don&#x27;t know that they do, my experience with it thus far is really minimal, but it does seem common so far), it seems like a case where use should lead design and the extra noise cut out.<p>Basically, if I have more than one kind of range on an object I&#x27;d probably rather have functions on the object that return the &#x27;unusual&#x27; ranges for the iteration. So rather than having:<p><pre><code>    for i in obj.iter() # the normal thing that I use all the time\n    for i in obj.bfs_iter() # something I use sometimes to be more explicit\n    for i in obj.dfs_iter() # another thing I use sometimes\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d rather have:<p><pre><code>    for i in obj # the normal thing that I use all the time\n    for i in obj.breadth_first() # something I use sometimes to be more explicit\n    for i in obj.depth_first() # another thing I use sometimes\n</code></pre>\nOr if there is no sensible default, to be forced to name the thing I actually need.<p>It seems entirely sensible to me to expect the for loop construct to take an Iterable object. It actually makes more sense to me than for it to take an iterator directly, conceptually.<p>On the question of &#x27;what if both?&#x27; I&#x27;d propose making it so hard (or impossible?) to do that. If for took Iterable, and Iterators also implemented Iterable as &quot;return this&quot;, there&#x27;d really be no concept of having both (except in that if you have an iterator, it is always both) and for itself would be left fairly uncomplicated while still being able to  take both Iterable and Iterator objects.<p>I&#x27;m probably missing some reason why this isn&#x27;t an obvious way to go, as a definite Rust newb, but it would feel natural to (my C++-rotted perhaps) brain. Also I know there&#x27;s no language changes until post-1.0, so for now it is what it is.<p>[edit] Huh. Ok, re-reading it looks like this was almost all covered ground. Never mind.",1397985835

7616322,comment,7615268,7615268,3,0,jwise0,,,"One of the interesting things that&#x27;s changed some since that article was written has been the advent of truly itsy-bitsy sensors, for instance on cell phone cameras.  Sony, OmniVision, and Aptina are all making sensors on the scale of 1/3&quot;, with pixel sizes as small as 1.1µm; the upshot of this is that the electrons wells for these pixels are fantastically tiny, and saturate well below 2,000 electrons.<p>This means that even on a bright, sunny day, with brilliant opportunities to pour light into the sensor while maintaining short exposure times, we /still/ can&#x27;t get as much light in as we want, because if we do, we&#x27;ll saturate the pixels -- and no amount of lowering the analog gain in the readout circuitry will recover the electrons that spilled out of the wells.  So, we end up with shot noise as a dominating factor for cell phone images, even in &quot;perfect&quot; conditions.<p>As we cram more pixels into sensors, noise reduction -- in many different modes -- will become an important battleground in which image sensor and SoC vendors will have to compete.  Glad to see it getting some attention :-)",1397985535

The important thing about Rust is its semantics (speed, safety, control), not its syntax.",1397985289

7616314,comment,7607248,7614570,1,0,jayjohnson,,,"All great points, and just goes to show we need to be updating the website and docs more actively. So for starters here’s where we are: we&#x27;re in week 7 of beta where the core focus is giving developers a free public sandbox for two hosted Endpoints + a single database per deployment all for free. We have two tools for using FlowStacks:<p>1) The Developer Dashboard (<a href=""https://flowstacks.com/developer/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://flowstacks.com/developer/</a>) is for testing new code, managing all endpoints, deployments, database schema (coming this week), and account details from a browser.<p>2) The command line interface (<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/cli/blob/master/fs.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/cli/blob/master/fs.py</a>) for full API capabilities, scripting, and the latest error handling.  We are a command line shop, so we use this to find bugs, and it already reports things like bad JSON syntax, API Validation, Python syntax, Exceptions, and as many other silly errors that really annoyed us.<p>We’re still building the advanced deployment and database management into the website, but all of the tools are already working from the command line. We are also close to releasing a working Django webserver that uses any Endpoint-level API file (<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/api/workflow_api.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/api/wo...</a>) for quickly mapping Javascript strings through Django into a working Job[1] hosted on any FlowStacks REST API. This factory style approach to building Jobs extends beyond Django, but since we’re a Python shop we went with it first. We planned on knocking out Rails next, but we are flexible.<p>Why FlowStacks? As developers, we wanted to have a Job hosted on a REST API where the API Inputs/Outputs can be Job-specific, and we did not care where the Job executed. For us, this API standardization has made us able to quickly build our own dashboard using and testing FlowStacks Jobs like any developer. We want the Dashboard arming developers just like .Net for debugging where streamlined testing drives features out faster, and it has to be simple to use (no Jenkins/Travis it’s all JSON black box testing similar to Postman). We built the command line interface for handling build regressions and showing how to use the FlowStacks User API and REST APIs from the command line. We also built the cli and dashboard for deploying your own GitHub repository into a REST API where your Job code defines the hosted API(dashboard build is coming this week). Jobs are easy to write. There’s only three parts to a Job: inputs[2], outputs[3], and tasks to perform (states)[4].  This allowed us to build some of the first Jobs like our Twitter Poster Job[5] because we did not want to login to Twitter. We also include Redis integration for any Jobs[6] out of the box already, and we use redis extensively for caching and publisher/subscribe patterns.<p>Our data policy is very open based off feedback we hear. Right now, we use Python’s ORM SQLAlchemy for any schema integration into your REST API’s database instance (<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/schema/demo_database_schema.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/schema...</a>) and Jobs can also use your new/legacy database(s) outside of FlowStacks. We just need a network connection. Here’s our example included in the Hello World for setting up a REST API Job to establish a connection to any database outside of FlowStacks:\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_db_flowstacks_create_new_record.py#L80-L91"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>Post Beta we plan on launching the on premise offering for Enterprise solution development and deployments on site. We can support these if needed, but for now we have it as a lower priority for us just trying to build a larger developer audience. Lastly, we are looking to build something with this, and we always want to hear some more great feedback like above.<p>Email me and let’s set a time to discuss this.<p>Cheers,\nJay<p>More References:<p>1 – API Job fields: \n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/api/workflow_api.json#L111"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/api/wo...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/api/workflow_api.json#L84"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/api/wo...</a><p>2 – Example Job Inputs:\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_send_email_template_to_user.py#L14-L21"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>3 – Outputs: \n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_send_email_template_to_user.py#L23-L24"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>4 – Example Job Tasks to Perform (States)\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_db_flowstacks_create_new_record.py#L209-L225"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>5 – Sample Twitter Job:\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/social-workflow/blob/master/src/ra_post_to_twitter.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/social-workflow/blob/master/sr...</a><p>6 – Redis Job Integration\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_store_simple_user_value.py#L57-L62"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>7 – Postman\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7615365"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7615365</a>",1397985232
7616313,comment,7615520,7615520,2,0,computator,,,"Good job on guide. I&#x27;ve seen many such privacy/security guides over the years, but the information gets out of date after a few years, so it&#x27;s nice to have a well-written fresh guide explaining recent issues and contemporary tools.<p>> <i>If the fact that TrueCrypt is not truly FOSS, or the implications of ‘plausible deniability’ worry you, there are a couple of other highly regarded encryption programs available</i><p>The phrase &quot;the implications of plausible deniability worry you&quot; sounds ominous to beginners in security/privacy issues, and might even discourage them from using TrueCrypt (which is the best such tool as you correctly mention).<p>It is possible to use TrueCrypt in a non-deniable way if that concerns someone: You would always create a hidden volume and then be prepared to reveal both the hidden volume and outer volume passphrases when required. Since TrueCrypt permits only 1 hidden container, your oppressor will be convinced that you&#x27;re not hiding additional data when you reveal the two passphrases. Such discussion however is way too much for the intended audience of your guide, so I suggest to leave this out as well.<p>> <i>even the most modest cell phone can be easily tracked by the satellites it uses to work</i><p>A &quot;modest cell phone&quot; doesn&#x27;t have GPS and is therefore not trackable by satellites. What you probably want to say is that even the most modest cell phone is easily tracked by proximity to a known cell tower. Its location can be further refined by triangular due to signal strength from neighboring cell towers.<p>> <i>A better tactic however, is to use the CCleaner utility (available for Windows and OSX), which not only cleans out pesky Flash cookies, but also a host other rubbish</i><p>You should mention BitBleach[1] instead of CCleaner or in addition to it. BitBleach is open source and even Bruce Schneier swears by it. I used both simultaneously for a while on my Windows systems and I found that BitBleach found <i>many</i> more files and junk to erase than CCleaner.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/</a>",1397985228

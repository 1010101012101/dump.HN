It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t take blame, yet somehow it doesn&#x27;t stick to them. They attend the meetings and post-mortems when things go wrong; but they have a superficial relationship with blame somehow. They take the issues seriously, yet it feels somehow like they&#x27;re not actually to blame, even when they&#x27;ve been involved the whole way through. Then one day you look up and notice that they&#x27;re smiling and chatting with someone on a different project team, they&#x27;ve moved on. Everyone will think their efforts were serious, well-intentioned, appropriate, etc. And the blame is palpably absent from them, while it clings to others like a bad smell.

That&#x27;s what --null (or -0) is for. (Use find instead.) The man page offers a similarly baffling argument:<p>> <i>xargs deals badly with special characters (such as space, &#x27; and &quot;). To see the problem try this:</i><p><pre><code>  touch important_file\n  touch &#x27;not important_file&#x27;\n  ls not* | xargs rm\n  mkdir -p &quot;My brother&#x27;s 12\\&quot; records&quot;\n  ls | xargs rmdir\n</code></pre>\nSame problem as the article: piping in the output of ls into xargs.<p>> <i>You can specify -0 or -d &quot;\\n&quot;, but many input generators are not optimized for using NUL as separator but are optimized for newline as separator.</i><p>I still don&#x27;t see the argument: if the generator is &quot;optimized for newline as a separator&quot;, then -d is what you need. But if your generator is outputting a list of file names (perhaps the most common case of xargs), then -0 is what you need. It is perhaps somewhat unfortunate that its use of whitespace (and bash&#x27;s use) make it so easy to write subtly incorrect programs; this is perhaps why there&#x27;s such common advice to use Python, or anything not Bash. But the argument above leads me to think that `ls | parallels` would somehow work, which it cannot, for the very reasons we must use xargs -0.<p>I suspect this is a long way about saying &quot;we have (somewhat more, but still not quite) sane defaults&quot;.<p>The correct command has always been `find . not* -print0 | xargs -0 ~/code/random/args.py`. Anything else is subject to weird corner cases of failure. It&#x27;s a sad state of affairs really, and I&#x27;d love to change it. If you&#x27;re just pounding out a command on the command line, you can usually ignore those corner cases, as you probably mentally <i>know</i> whether `ls not*` is going to cause issues or not; if you&#x27;re writing a script for general use, then it&#x27;s only a matter of time until it fails in interesting ways.",1400570865

My spouse is part of a union and no one is intimidated.<p>How much choice did he/she have in joining the union? When you receive the emails and letters before a vote, how many are from union members speaking against the union? If it&#x27;s always 0, then there is some level of intimidation that your spouse likely hasn&#x27;t been exposed to because he/she agrees with whatever the union says.<p>All 3 of the unions my parents were members of always put immense pressure on members that spoke out against the union because they don&#x27;t want the company to see that there is any kind of uncertainty. Even the legal/job threats when you refuse to pay your dues because you don&#x27;t want to be a part of their organization is a form of intimidation.",1400570335

A couple years ago, probably due to bad posture, I started getting pain in the left upper back. I neglected it. The pain slowly increased and now if I sit for some time, I start getting pain in the lower left back, too(the lower back pain goes away when I walk/stand - the upper back pain is always there). An orthopedic had me do an X-Ray and concluded this was a condition called Myofascitis. I could see my upper few vertebrae compressed together in the X-Ray, and this could be irritating the myofascial tissues and nerves around that region, the doctor said, adding that this condition can&#x27;t be &quot;treated&quot; and that I&#x27;ll have to &quot;manage&quot; this pain by 1. fixing posture, 2. never riding a bike in my life(he asked me to get a car) and 3. getting regular massages for short term relief. He added that Vitamin D and Yoga have been known to help people with the same condition.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear from people who&#x27;ve been through this - What did and did not work for you? Are there any people here with knowledge in this area(spinal orthopedics) who can tell us more?",1400569769

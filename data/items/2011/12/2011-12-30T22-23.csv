You also write an interpreter, rather than another compiler for the same source language, written in some other language for which a compiler already exists. This means that the amount of code you are writing to get the language up and running is smaller, since interpreters are easier to write than a whole second compiler.<p>So what you say is true--it is a good way to see how the language feels--but not relevant to the facet of language development I was musing about.",1325285962

So you'd need to carry a bunch of smaller ones with you, or shoot them at the probe as it accelerates (harder and harder to do), at which point we have the same current problems - large masses, or shooting things at other things to propel them.<p>--<p>After thinking about it for a bit, I don't think miniaturization for very-long-range probes would work very well anyway.  You can't focus signals beyond a certain degree, dictated by your reflector size, so you either need a lot of power to send signals long distances or very large reflectors to compensate for lower power.<p>The reflectors could conceivably be something like a solar sail - huge and light - but you still have to carry it and deploy it and ensure it stays focused as you approach other stars (solar winds).  You're stuck with rigid and heavier or flexible and useless, and if it's big enough it'll push you away from the star regardless of its ability to hold a shape.<p>At which point we're pretty much stuck with using, thus carrying, more power beyond the inflection point.

As a member of the House of Representatives, part of the Congress, it's been explicitly Paul's job to set policy.<p>We're evaluating individuals here, not branches of government.<p>The House is probably the most most important single body in the government, and if we are unhappy with the laws, we should indeed generally hold that body as the first layer of accountability.<p>Ron Paul, on the other hand, is one of 435 members of the House. He does not chair a committee and has chaired one subcommittee for one year. He heads a congressional caucus--that's good--but it has ~12 members and virtually no record of legislation or other action. Separately he has gotten ~1 bill passed in his career and a very small number of notable amendments. He has not been a decisive vote on virtually any issue.<p>Many individuals have policy powers vastly exceeding this, including not only (obviously) the president, AG, Supreme Court, and perhaps 100+ Congressional leaders, but also (I would aver) the Cabinet, Federal Reserve Board, OLC, JCs, and dozens or hundreds of others.<p>I think it's very common for people to treat all members of Congress as if they're the same, but Ron Paul is not John Boehner or Nancy Pelosi.<p>Ron Pauls's power comes from his writings and speeches on various principles of governmental power and the economy. If he's been remiss on that exact front--hired famous cranks like Lew Rockwell to ghost for him and then failed to review his work--then he's mismanaged his power. I'm not saying that he's a criminal in the sense that, say, Warren Harding is a criminal, but it's absolutely relevant to his candidacy.<p>edit: Ron Paul does chair one subcommittee as of Jan 2011--misstated that.",1325285598

Based on Assange's theory of conspiracy, you're attacking one of the nodes in the connected graph of conspiracies.<p>* as a government actor attacking Stratfor would be a perfectly underhand and effective way of rousing the establishment to call for an even greater curtailing of internet freedoms. You're embarrassing all the right people, but giving most of them enough time to cancel credit cards before any real damage is done. The way the announcements have been done certainly don't support the idea that whoever is responsible is wanting to maximise mayhem.<p>I should re-iterate here that exploring possibilities <i>does not</i> mean the explorer supports or believes the possibilities explored.

What actually happens is the student takes the class, notices that they don't like the subject, and is disinterested for the rest of a whole term, even though they are still graded and can not switch.<p>In the case of b), some bigwig university rector decided that x courses in subject y must be taken by students of major z. Z students of course blow the class off because they don't want to take it. Professors know this, and don't care much if  Z students learn anything anyway. They want to focus on the students that are actually going to major in the subject of y. No one stands up to the rector and everyone takes the path of least friction.<p>Solution: Have some goddamn flexibility. Don't enforce a strict ordering when taking classes. Don't force students into a single required class as much as possible. Instead say ""must take two of these 5 classes"". Have your majors defined this way also: Eg. Computer Science is 1 intro, 3 theory, 2 low level, 2 software engineering and design, 1 social issues class and 2 major projects. You can spell out specific classes that MUST be taken afterwards. Have quarters instead of semesters so that classes ""die fast"" and students can focus more on fewer subjects. This ends up being very intensive but there are more breaks. Allow students to fail 3 times without penalty, so they can experiment with classes out of their comfort zone, like grad classes or classes from a different major altogether. Have freshman year multidisciplinary problem solving seminars so that students have some idea of how project work an research happens, and what subjects they are interested in.<p>My school did most of this for a very long time and the students loved it.

Well-designed C++ libraries that don't need to push the performance envelope are often pleasant to use.<p>Maybe the author wants things to be even simpler, but he's gotta provide examples.

Other languages do APIs better.<p>C++ is useful for implementing the <i>guts</i> of things.  And when implementing, having <i>your own</i> library of shared C++ code is useful, as long as you <i>completely</i> control it and always compile it with your project from scratch (a library of templates, for instance).  The last thing you want is to link to someone else's compiled C++ library because that's where the pain begins.<p>To expose a C++ implementation, use a plain C interface; the C application binary interface works very well across compilers.  If you feel it absolutely necessary to expose something like the inheritance scheme of an object-oriented design, you had better do it in a language like Objective-C that can at least implement objects in a very forward-compatible way (or use tricks like exposing pointer parameters in C functions).",1325284013

3409339,comment,3405737,3408257,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> Dasher was one of the inspirations for KType actually. When I came across it years ago, I tried to make it work for my cousin but it requires a lot of dexterity and timing, even when configured properly.<p>Dasher does not necessarily require dexterity or timing.  You don't have to run it in ""continuous"" mode, where it moves to the right constantly or relies on something pointing to the right for speed.  You can put Dasher into a mode where it has a single binary input: go up-right one step, or go down-right one step.  Effectively, you enter one bit of information at a time, and Dasher's arithmetic coding makes the number of bits you have to enter as efficient as possible.  In a mode like that, you don't need either dexterity or timing.  You can still enter any possible text, but you'll find that it takes far fewer bits to enter common English text than random gibberish.  Without arithmetic coding, you'd have to enter an average of log base 2 of 26, or 4.7 bits per letter, ignoring capitalization or punctuation.  With arithmetic coding, you can easily get to a few bits per <i>word</i>, even with Dasher's simplifying constraint of keeping things alphabetically sorted (so it won't offer you vowels versus consonants even though that might require fewer bits of information than a partition of the sorted dictionary, because the sorted dictionary provides a simpler mental model).<p>> And when I looked at it last, it did not support a high-level of word-completion / finishing sentences. On KType, if the user wants to type 'GIVE ME SOME FOOD', they type 'GV', select 'GIVE' on screen, then 'ME' on screen, then type 'S' and select 'SOME' and so on.<p>Dasher has supported high-level language models for a long time.  You can feed it a giant corpus of text, and it'll extract not just letter models but word models as well.  Once you steer into 'G', you'll find 'i' much more common than 'h' or 'j', so 'i' will have a larger region to aim for (but you can still steer into the smaller 'h' if you want to spell ""ghost"", or the even smaller 'j' if you want to talk about the GNOME Javascript framework ""gjs"").  Once you write 'Gi', 've' will have a visible region all its own.  Once you write 'Give', you'll already see a visible region for 'me', and so on.  When you write common phrases, you very quickly start writing significant fractions of a sentence at once.<p>To use one of the other examples from your twitter corpus, if you typed ""hulk"", you'd likely see a visible region for ""smash"". :)<p>So, yes, Dasher has very strong predictive models.<p>Dasher also avoids the ""modal"" approach of switching between typing individual letters and selecting completions; they all use the same input mechanism.  I also like their philosophy that as long as you can cause your body to output one bit of information, Dasher can work for you.",1325283895

About 60 students or so in a class.<p>Now, I might have been a lousy teacher, or some of my students could not have cared less about introductory Financial concepts, but what I witnessed between my students and my colleagues' made me very skeptical of any value a college degree has. This was simple math, simple concepts and even simpler recitation of various facts. But I suppose that can be excused, some people just don't jive with such things, but worse:<p><pre><code>    A large majority of students were numbingly apathetic and put forth 0 effort, 
    but still came crawling back after tests asking for extra credit or mulligans.

I posted the scans on Facebook, so now everyone in the extended family (dozens of nieces, nephews, cousins, what have you) can see them. The pic of my grandmother is around 85 years old. Is the original photo a precious object, worthy of cherishing? Certainly (and obviously, given that it's survived all this time). But, you know, it was her precious object alone. Now all of us can see the picture any time we want. This is GOOD.<p>Is a first edition of Robinson Crusoe a precious object? Of course. It's also (I'm guessing) quite rare and extremely expensive. Yet anyone with a Kindle or Nook (or even a computer) can get Robinson Crusoe from Project Gutenberg for free. Most of the PG audience isn't going to be able to afford a library full of fine leather-bound books. The choice isn't between the fine leather-bound book and the etext. It's between the etext and not being able to read the book at all.<p>We've seen this play out in many other areas. Mass-produced clothing is another example -- is it as nice as individually-tailored clothing? Nope. But most of us can't afford a wardrobe full of custom-tailored stuff (and historically, people didn't; most folks had a set of ""work clothes"" and maybe one set of ""Sunday clothes"", if that).<p>For that matter, exactly the same scenario played out when the printing press was introduced. Esthetes decried the loss of the hand-written medieval volumes, lovingly calligraphed and illuminated by highly skilled scribe/artists. They were breathtakingly beautiful. One book also cost somewhere around a year's wages for a skilled worker.",1325282610

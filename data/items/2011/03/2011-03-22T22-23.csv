I remember thinking that search and ads were going to be huge when I bought Inktomi & DoubleClick stock during the last stock bubble. I of course got my head served on a platter on that, but it was cool to get into search a few years later & be right that time. The Google IPO gains made up for the losses on the earlier bets, but everything comes down to timing & then just sticking with something you believe in.<p>The first site you find in any category won't likely be the best one, just the one which is the most heavily marketed. But the same was true before their was a web.<p>The hard part with paid content is that the more common it becomes the harder it is for Google or other ad networks to take a big slice of the value chain. For that reason I see the move to paid online content being a slow one (outside of niche b2b sort of environments).",1300834652

2356902,comment,2354531,2355142,0,0,jallmann,,,"Concurrency does not necessarily have anything to do with parallel programming, although the latter may need to be aware of concurrency issues if the parallel algorithm needs to manage shared resources and sequential dependencies.<p>The gist of the article is that functional languages lend themselves to parallel constructs, and such tooling should be built into languages themselves to free the programmer from worrying about concurrency issues. For more details, read on...<p>Asymptotic efficiency is just a fancy way of saying algorithmic efficiency. In computer science terms, asymptotic analysis measures how work increases relative to how much input needs to be processed; eg, sorting an N-element list using Quicksort would take an amount of work corresponding to NlogN.<p>Now, when you try to parallelize an algorithm such as Quicksort, you are concerned with your speedup -- how much you will gain by processing in parallel. The speedup is not always linear because of sequential dependencies within the algorithm. Wiki has a decent primer on the subject: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedup</a>.<p>In this case, the article was looking at the asymptotic efficiency of Quicksort's critical section; eg, the part that could be parallelized, to determine just <i>how much</i> it could be parallelized.<p>Concurrency, on the other hand, deals with more classical problems such as scheduling and resource deadlock. It is the OS's job to manage resources, which is why you hear a lot about concurrency in terms of the OS. And since thread/process scheduling by the OS is unpredictable, this is where 'nondeterministic composition' comes from. This manifests in things like race conditions. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition</a><p>So it may become the parallel application's responsibility to avoid such nondeterministic behavior within resources shared by the application. Note this doesn't just apply to threads running on the same computer/OS; it may also apply to data coming in from the network from a distributed parallel algorithm.<p>In conventional, procedural programming languages, concurrency has to be addressed explicitly through things like locks and barriers. Functional languages help make this more implicit due to immutability. Languages like Erlang go one step further and absolve you of any responsibility for things like IPC.<p>HTH.",1300834198

2356889,comment,2356039,2356623,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It's swings and roundabouts. The bad side is the lazy rent-seeking activity, where publishers collect royalties for longer than the average human lifespan and generally pass little or none of the proceeds onto the original creator, often a starving artist. This has gotten to the point of complete regulatory capture in the US; although the very unreasonableness of the current law is the greatest factor behind technical progress designed to circumvent it, for the present it results in a huge economic waste.<p>On the other hand, it's only very recently that the digital distribution has become universally available at negligible cost. Up to very recently, the cost of providing a single copy on demand was so high that only mass production made any economic sense, and few authors had the resources or desire to invest the required amounts of time and money. So if it wasn't for the publishers, humanity's body of knowledge would be all that large in the first place. A few centuries back, printing and publishing were the edgy disruptive industries which upset the existing model of hand-copying manuscripts for powerful patrons like the aristocracy and religious institutions. Rather than worrying about the general public downloading and copying, those gatekeepers were worried about the general public having the ability to purchase and read things for themselves, instead of being told what a priest or sheriff thought fit for them to know - and a good many publishers along the way paid for their insistence on democratizing information with liberty or even life.<p>So their failure to adjust to near-zero marginal costs of copying over the last ~30 years other than via outsize lawsuits seems relatively mild in the historical scheme of things. I think the key to speeding this transition is to provide authors, editors, and other people whose creative work is a necessary input with better ways to make a living than working for a publisher. Up to now, marketing and distributing content or creative services (eg editing) has been too difficult and expensive for individuals to offer a good return...which is one reason that marketing often accounts for 75% of a publishing launch budget nowadays.",1300833929

2356781,comment,2356039,2356510,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Yes, but I was talking about the difference to Google's <i>bottom line</i>. The unavailability of little-known or orphaned works and/or a somewhat higher payout for infringement in some of those cases, would not have a very big <i>financial</i> impact on Google or its book digitization project. An incomplete collection would be a shame, but Google could continue to scan the works and just abstain from exploiting or republishing them pending some future evolution of the legal environment. On the other hand, a broader rejection which made the project into a potential financial disaster for Google might have resulted in the whole venture being terminated, a much greater loss for internet readers.<p>With few exceptions, the difficult of locating the rights-holders for obscure and orphan literary works stems from their lack of literary or commercial value: if the copyright had been worth protecting, someone would have maintained an active claim of ownership. The number of <i>valuable</i> works whose copyright owners cannot be located is small - in the worst case, they'll be inaccessible to internet readers in the short term but will become available later when the copyright expires. But in most cases, readers won't be missing much. The truly dedicated can still go to a physical library which has a paper copy.<p>You seem to think I prefer the opt-in approach; in fact I was perfectly fine with the existing settlement offer, and I'm sorry that it has been rejected by the court. All I am saying is the court's rejection could have been worse, and Google may choose to live with the loss of the suggested alternative. Now it's going to go through another year or three of legal wrangling, which will limit further investment by Google, slow deployment of the technology, and reduce startup opportunities based on leveraging the Books API.<p>Nor am I blind to the inconvenience for researchers and scholars that an opt-in or other limitations might impose. As a matter of fact I'm dealing with that exact problem right now: there is a book-length government report that I very much want to study for a personal research project, but thanks to a legislative scheduling snafu back in 1995 no funds were ever allocated to print or archive it properly (it's not classified or anything). There is <i>one</i> typewritten manuscript copy stored in the Library of Congress and <i>one</i> photocopy of that stored in an agency archive. That's it - only two publicly accessible copies exist. There's an interesting backstory, but right now my choices are to spend $150 to have someone in Washington DC photocopy the whole thing or to wait until I have time, cash and an excuse to visit DC and spend a day copying it myself at a (slightly) lower cost. Copyright isn't at issue here, but trust me, I'm keenly aware of the frustration that arises from knowing something exists but being unable to easily access it.",1300832101

My question is: what legal basis does the developer of a GPL library have to sue somebody who released a program linked with that library. If the two only come together to form a combined work on the users machine, at the users command, then how does the GPL apply to me, the distributor of the the non-GPL program? I am not distributing a combined or derivative work. At most I am using the headers and distributing the symbol names, which are not covered by copyright. When I make no copies, how does copyright law affect me?<p>If the headers were covered by copyright, that would have provided a way for a developer to prevent use of their GPL library by non-GPL programs.",1300831358

2356726,comment,2354531,2355142,0,0,T-R,,,"Concurrency = managing shared resources. Things like mutual exclusion and transactions. Getting processors to get in line (serialization/composition) for a shared resource instead of just trampling over each other by just grabbing it when they want (non-determinism), so that actions that depend on being done in order and without interruption can be done.<p>Parallelism = splitting up subtasks that don't depend on each other. If the tasks don't depend on each other, the things doing them shouldn't need to talk. If you have enough processors, you can do almost everything at once, so the algorithm is only as slow as things that actually <i>need</i> to be done in order (asymptotic efficiency).<p>In imperative programming, we tell the computer what order to do things in, so it doesn't know what actions don't depend on each other - to parallelize, we have to worry about concurrency. In functional programming, the compiler knows what depends on what (what uses the result of something else), so it can parallelize things that don't depend on each other. It might be implemented with concurrency, but the programmer doesn't need to worry about it.",1300831289

And they aren't related.<p>Actually, they're incredibly similar in terms of class hierarchy, design patterns (e.g., delegates, data sources, target/action for the most part), graphics principles (points vs pixels), use of various Foundation and CoreGraphics data structures, etc.<p>And yes, Core Animation works quite well with layer-backed views in AppKit, which is where it started.<p>It's easy to point out specific differences between these frameworks, but I think any developer who's already learned one would object to the underestimation of his/her intelligence that would be implied by comparing the subsequent difficulty in moving to the other with that of any other non-Apple platform SDK.<p>Perhaps you'd like to point out another SDK that is <i>more</i> similar to AppKit than UIKit?",1300831274

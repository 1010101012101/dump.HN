6894392,comment,6893971,6894178,4,0,jrochkind1,,,"So what&#x27;s the difference between &#x27;money&#x27; and &#x27;currency&#x27;? If you start thinking about what either of these words mean exactly, and then start researching it -- you&#x27;ll discover that even economists aren&#x27;t sure and there are several competing theories of what &#x27;money&#x27; actually is.<p>&#x27;money&#x27; is the more complicated concept. If bitcoin is &#x27;money&#x27;, then whether it&#x27;s &#x27;currency&#x27; or not mostly just depends, I think,  on whether you want the definition of currency to include digital certificates or only physical objects. Not a very interesting question, just a matter of definitions. Now, what &#x27;money&#x27; is, that&#x27;s an interesting question.",1386856703
6894391,comment,6894320,6894320,1,0,simbolit,,,"one of the incentives for refraining from a 51% attack is the exchange rate of bitcoin itself. such an attack being carried out and publicised would very likely deal a major blow to the currency exchange rate. as these pools make money from mining bitcoins (that is after all their very reason for existing) they would then lose out financially in a big way. in order to make up for these losses they&#x27;d have to doublespend a shitload of bitcoin in exchange for stable assets. and the greater the doublespend problem gets, the more confidence in btc is eroded, which then, once again, makes the price plummet.<p>thus, from my amateur perspective, this seems highly unlikely atm.",1386856683
6894390,comment,6894244,6894244,26,0,tokenadult,,,"Whether news is bad for you or not probably depends more than a little on what the source is. I don&#x27;t watch television—for years our TV was in a box in a closet, brought out mostly just for watching the Olympics. But I do look at Google News and try to train it to give me mostly long-form suggestions about science and world issues from diverse sources with professional reporting and editing. That helps.<p>The claim that giving up reading news will make you happier is a medical claim in the article that is not backed up by reliable medical sources,[1] so I call baloney on that. The newspaper opinion writer here (promoting his new book with excerpts from the book) doesn&#x27;t report the issue the way a competent reporter would report it, but just makes a bunch of broad general statements with no nuance. In other words, the medical claims about happier human life in the article are just like the made-up opinions we can all easily find on the Internet, and the article stands as an example of how we can find blatantly misleading &quot;information&quot; inside or outside the professional news media. I have no reason to suppose that the full-length book is a medically reliable source (the publisher of the book is identified at the end of the article).<p>Anecdote alert: I&#x27;m a curious person and I like to learn, and so one of the reasons I come here to Hacker <i>NEWS</i> is to find out new facts about the external world that I didn&#x27;t know before, including facts about current events (&quot;news&quot; in the narrow sense). My personal experience—which, to be sure, may differ from yours—is that I am a happier and more productive person when I know, from good sources, what is going on all over the world and the broader context of expanding human knowledge. But I&#x27;m sure you can find an opinion column somewhere based on a popular book with a different opinion from mine.<p>AFTER EDIT: Good catch! Another participant here on HN noticed that the author of the article kindly submitted here has credibly been accused of plagiarism by more than one published author who works harder than he does. I upvoted that comment for what it added to our understanding of the article&#x27;s background.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDRS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDRS</a>",1386856669

6894369,comment,6894244,6894333,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I <i>think</i> what happens is that we start viewing the world in overly-simplified political narratives, say left versus right, that can fit inside a typical news story. So if there&#x27;s a shooting, it&#x27;s a gun control story, and we have the same old assholes on TV saying the same old things. We become conditioned to think of everything in the world in cartoonish terms. Media outlets are only too happy to fill the space with people arguing. And it&#x27;s always the same arguing. Arguing has become a commodity for consumption.<p>This makes the reporting itself really bad, since the only context the reporter needs to fit the event into is some off-the-shelf political bullshit, and it makes the outlets try to drive up viewership by having presenters who more and more have these recurring populist rages. Every night on TV there&#x27;s somebody getting mad about something. So the reporters dig up enough to fuel the machine -- usually fed by the political parties, PACs, or other interested groups -- and the pundits and reactionaries do the dance. The viewer is left constantly seesawing from topic to topic. Are HMOs out to kill people? Will a child molester living five miles take my kid? There&#x27;s no context to any of this because nobody gets paid to provide context. They get paid to make viewers frightened and angry, which drives up ratings.<p>That&#x27;s unsustainable, in my opinion.<p>In printed media, without the branding or signaling, authors are required to provide a thesis and support it with an argument. The reader can choose to engage or not. There&#x27;s no &quot;if it bleeds, it leads&quot; nonsense. I can read great commentary that I disagree with -- and not feel angry or somehow moved to outrage. Or I can read commentary I agree with that&#x27;s a piece of junk. I&#x27;m no longer taking sides. Instead, I can separate my consumption of events from my characterization of the reporting itself. That&#x27;s the critical piece that&#x27;s missing for most news consumers.<p>Just guesswork on my part, though.",1386856456

Yea, it was a nice round number out of the air. But it probably wasn&#x27;t far off the mark.<p>For all the other comments, below is a blog post on the matter which is going to go live shortly:<p>With the story about our PrivateSky takedown now public, I want to take the opportunity to clarify a few points in various articles that have appeared since yesterday covering the story.<p>The headline strongly infers our friends at GCHQ “forced” us to take PrivateSky down. That’s hogwash. In fact, the headline contradicts the article, which becomes clear as you read it.<p>Secondly, a very important point wasn’t printed. GCHQ couldn’t, by law, request a blanket back door on the system. There are a very rigid set of controls that mean only specific individuals can come under surveillance. The legal request for such surveillance has a due process that must be stridently followed. At no time did I or anyone at CertiVox talk about CertiVox in relation to any RIPA warrant, only the generic process by which these warrants are served.<p>By saying “our friends at GCHQ”, there is no facetiousness intended. The team at CertiVox have the upmost respect for the folks we interacted with at GCHQ. They took the due process I outlined in the previous point very seriously. We found that as an organisation, and every individual involved there, were as worried about a breach of public trust as much as we are.<p>Finally, I believe very strongly the following should be a larger part of the public discourse of these subjects. What everyone needs to understand is that every developed democracy in the world, even where privacy rights are enshrined to the maximum efficacy by statute, has laws on the books that mandate that Internet Service Providers have facilities to work with law enforcement for the purposes of legal intercept, to enforce public safety and security.<p>Being L.I. capable is a very important set features and functions that must be in place for any credible, commercial service on the Internet. In endeavouring to make PrivateSky as secure as possible, we overlooked this critical requirement when we built PrivateSky.<p>When CertiVox positioned PrivateSky as the easiest to use and most secure encrypted messaging service, we really had two significant points of differentiation. First, even though we held the root encryption keys to the system, it was architected in such as way that it would have been all but impossible for our internal staff to snoop on our customer’s communications, or for the service to leak any of our customer’s data. Secondly, our possession of the root keys, and our use of identity based encryption, made the system incredibly easy to use. For the user, there were no private or public keys to manage, every workflow was handled for the user in an easy to grasp pure HTML5 interface, no hardware or software required, just an HTML5 browser.<p>We boxed ourselves into a feature set and market position that when called upon to comply with legal statues, we simply had no alternative but to shut the service down. We built it, but we couldn’t host it.<p>Why? Because as you can probably surmise, there is an inherent impedance mismatch between being able to host a commercial communications service that gives the upmost in privacy to its users, against any breach, whilst at the same time being able to operate safely within the confines of the law as it is on the books in most countries on the planet.<p>Is this wrong? Actually, I don’t think it is. This may be an unpopular viewpoint, but I cannot argue against having a well regulated legal intercept function as being necessary to have in place for a society that prizes law and order and the safety of its citizens. This is speaking as someone who lived in NYC during 9/11.<p>In summary, it’s the abuse of the communications interception in the Snowden revelations that has everyone up in arms, as so it should. But that’s not what happened with PrivateSky.<p>What is our next move?<p>Watch this space.<p>-----&quot;",1386855668

At some point you have to just figure out when the effort expended outweighs the potential benefits and cut your losses, and I think this post is written in a clear and fair way.<p>The thing that makes me upset though is that there isn&#x27;t a central place that can clearly explains the pitfalls that he fell in, what the best way to do it on App Engine, and why.  Those docs are kind of a mess, amirite?",1386855306

6894282,comment,6894244,6894244,6,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I&#x27;ve been trying an experiment for the last year or two. I have an app that collects commentary, tech and science stories from across the web. (Recently I added news, but that was a mistake)<p>I find I stay just as informed reading commentary, where I&#x27;m purposefully being manipulated, as I do reading news. In fact the news is better, as various authors advance various personal theories they&#x27;ve been working on for weeks or months, using the current events as fodder. Reading a couple of these from different viewpoints provides wonderful context -- and context is the one thing critically missing from most &quot;breaking news&quot; reporting. The only difference is about a 12-hour delay. Trust me, the world does not depend on whether I know something that quickly. Twitter peeps will annoy me if something truly incredible happens.<p>I&#x27;m also finding that branding, whether by news outlet, author, or social signaling, is a terrible indicator of quality. As I continue to flush out the app, my belief is that a better indicator is statistical clustering around personality types, but that&#x27;s still a year or two away.<p>But one thing is for sure: I&#x27;ve been much happier since I gave up all forms of news consumption. News is based on emotional manipulation. It&#x27;s always a crisis, there&#x27;s always an argument, and there&#x27;s always some terrible danger you&#x27;ve been unaware of. That stuff will rot your mind. It&#x27;s always been bad; it&#x27;s just gotten worse over the last few decades as the news cycle has shortened.",1386855232

And I grant I should&#x27;ve left out that excess of cleverness in the Newspeak style; it confuses the point, and while Orwell has written many things worth referencing, <i>Nineteen Eighty-four</i> is almost never among them. Unfortunately, I found the meter too appealing to discard, and the description is accurate enough, however distasteful you find the formulation I chose.<p>Criticism is well and good. For example, one might usefully point out that his dialectical materialism is obviously rusty, and that he therefore mistakenly considers his obviously petit-bourgeoisie self to be a member of the working class -- a truly risible proposition.<p>There is, though, a material difference between mere criticism, and someone being caned in the public press for having spoken of the indigent in an insufficiently respectful fashion, to the extent that he feels the need to utter a belly-crawling public apology -- which, as always, only further inflames the piranha [1] infesting [2] what passes [3] for modern Internet discourse -- and that he&#x27;s also disavowed [4] by the company which he, for the moment, leads.<p>Said disavowal is necessary, of course, for the same reason it was foolish of Gopman to utter his plaint in such a publicly attributable fashion, rather than, for example, over beers with a few trusted friends in a quiet, out-of-the-way bar, or better yet at home. But of course it would be entirely [5] unreasonable [6] to suggest that anyone intends to intimidate anyone. And the only hyperbole [7] in evidence [8] is entirely mine! How plainly ridiculous that I or anyone should describe Gopman&#x27;s opinions as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;impermissible&quot;, simply because there is a large bloc which does not accept them, will not permit them, and has the power to enforce these preferences without effective opposition.<p>(And there is nothing even slightly laughable in Valleywag, sort of a less intellectually hefty and more pretentious TMZ, calling [9] <i>anything</i> &quot;about as weighty as telling the world&#x27;s longest knock knock joke&quot;. Perhaps it takes one to know one.)<p>Getting back to the point, I&#x27;d actually have to say Gopman is getting off fairly lightly, so far at least. Were he a mere employee instead of a CEO, he might already be out of a job. Who was that fellow who rejected the &quot;him&quot; -> &quot;them&quot; commit on the Node.js Github? Noordhuis, that was his name -- an HN cause celebre, for two or three hours at least. He crossed the same sort of people, and look what happened to him! [10]<p>So, yes, I maintain there is a difference between anything which can fairly be termed &quot;criticism&quot;, and the sort of low-calorie, uniquely West Coast-flavored struggle session we see here. Criticism, after all, has as its ultimate purpose the improvement of its recipient, while what we see here, as always when the Internet social justice piranha smell blood, is much more like -- if you&#x27;ll forgive me going back to the well one more time -- a crowdsourced Two Minutes Hate, with Gopman, or whoever else has most recently had the temerity to express an unacceptable, impermissible opinion and the carelessness to be publicly caught so doing, in the starring role.<p>Perhaps you imagine this to be evidence of a healthy society. If so, I wish I shared your optimism.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/12/11/3050501/angelhack-ceo-homeless-degenerates/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/12/11/3050501/angelhac...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gopmania/status/410814090148212736\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/Gopmania/status/410814090148212736</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://sfist.com/2013/12/11/angelhack_startup_ceo_trashes_sfs_d.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sfist.com/2013/12/11/angelhack_startup_ceo_trashes_sf...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sabeen_sabeen/status/411013749433053184\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/sabeen_sabeen/status/411013749433053184</a> (note the retweets)<p>[5] <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Startup-CEO-Who-Complained-About-San-Francisco-s-5055464.php#vf-10840000000159\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Sta...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http://sfist.com/2013/12/11/angelhack_startup_ceo_trashes_sfs_d.php#comment-1158957288\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sfist.com/2013/12/11/angelhack_startup_ceo_trashes_sf...</a><p>[7] <a href=\"http://sfist.com/2013/12/11/angelhack_startup_ceo_trashes_sfs_d.php#comment-1159321583\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sfist.com/2013/12/11/angelhack_startup_ceo_trashes_sf...</a><p>[8] <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=techbro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/search?q=techbro</a><p>[9] <a href=\"http://valleywag.gawker.com/happy-holidays-startup-ceo-complains-sf-is-full-of-hum-1481067192\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://valleywag.gawker.com/happy-holidays-startup-ceo-compl...</a><p>[10] <a href=\"http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/12/03/bnoordhuis-departure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/12/03/bnoordhuis-departure/</a>",1386854364

6894195,comment,6893495,6893970,2,0,biot,,,"I don&#x27;t think my remarks were particularly offhand given that their post indicates a lack of understanding of how App Engine works. Based on that misunderstanding and poor architectural / implementation choices, they then go on to say that the data store is slow, App Engine creates too many instances, requests were timing out, and memcache is too limited. These criticisms of App Engine might be valid for certain uses, if it were not for the fact that the way they built the application is likely the very cause of their problems.<p>For instance, I&#x27;m 95% confident that the work they did upon instance startup was build the search index based on reading:<p><pre><code>  &quot;We HAD to use the search API for the last few months\n   because we couldn’t keep our indexes in memory, because\n   of the start up time (discussed earlier).&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll make some assumptions here because I don&#x27;t have access to more information, but their search index is likely being built off of what is stored in the datastore. First off, calculating this all at instance startup is inappropriate. What if App Engine switches to a ZeroVM implementation where every request is effectively a new instance? They would be building an index just to throw it away right after. Or if instance lifetimes were limited to five minutes, it&#x27;s the same problem. What if the amount of data in their datastore scales up by three orders of magnitude? Were they planning to burn through hours of instance startup time to build this index?<p>Not to mention that this index is most likely a deterministic function. In other words, given input data X, the result is always going to be output data X&#x27;. The fact that they recalculate the results of a deterministic function upon each instance startup is 100% wasteful. This is the direct cause of their request timeouts. Additionally, it&#x27;s also the likely cause of the datastore slowness. As they state:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Pre-computations at start up kept the new instances \n   busy, and app engine was creating more and more instances\n   to handle this.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSo startup was taking such a long time because it had to (1) pull data from the datastore and (2) perform lengthy calculations on that data. App Engine saw the instance as being exremely busy therefore it spawned a new instance. Rinse and repeat. The datastore is going to get hammered with overlapping requests. No wonder it&#x27;s slow. They may have also used a sub-optimal schema. It&#x27;s been about three or four years since I&#x27;ve worked with App Engine, but I recall that their default datastore performed much better based on your choice of entity groups, etc. They should have used a background task for index building (if absolutely required), which is able to run for hours if needed. Store the results of the index build into the blob store. Retrieve that as needed without any recalculation.<p>Another thing they criticize is search API performance as being too slow. The current live application appears to do realtime search as you type. If they were implementing realtime search on top of App Engine&#x27;s search API, I can see how that would be unsuitable as well. The search API is designed to take the results of a single query and fetch the results. If a search operation takes 500ms, that&#x27;s not very fast but overall isn&#x27;t a big deal. If that&#x27;s 500ms per keystroke, then that will be massively slow. Searching upon hitting ENTER or clicking a button would have solved that. Or they could have re-thought their implementation if realtime is required.<p>App Engine is definitely not suitable for all problems, but it too deserves more credit than their blog entry gives it.",1386853783

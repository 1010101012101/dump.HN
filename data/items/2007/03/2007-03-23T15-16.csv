5930,comment,5802,5875,0,0,rfrey,,,"I didn't mean to suggest that there are no programmers who can do good design -- I'm sure there are many.  I suspect that most programmers (like most bus drivers, or most doctors) aren't good designers, though.  But unlike bus drivers or doctors, programmers are often pressed into design work: sometimes by their boss, sometimes by their ego. :)",1174662563

His analysis was good, but the markets apparently didn't read his book and he went under.",1174662360
5928,comment,5776,5901,0,0,rfrey,,,"Another way of looking at this (actually just a rephrasing of what you've said) is that the mathematical expectation of a strategy is the sum of (the profit of each event multiplied by the probability of it happening.)  That is<p>expec = sum(prob(x)<i>x)<p>For an $ investment, $expect = sum(prob(x)</i>x - invest(x))<p>Say we have two strategies: One invests nothing and is right 90% of the time, but pays 0 when it's right; the other invests $50,000 and is right 10% of the time.  When it is right it pays 10x, or $500,000.<p>exp(strategy 1) = prob(x)<i>x - 0x = (0.9)</i>0 - 0 = 0<p>exp(strategy 2) = prob(x)<i>x - x = (0.1)</i>10 -1 = 0<p>So if we only have a 10% success rate and a 10x payoff, we might as well be sipping tequila on the beach.  But if we are smart, or hard working, and increase our probability to 20%:<p>exp(strategy 2) = prob(x)<i>x - x = (0.2)</i>10 -1 = 1<p>which is a positive expectation, which is a good thing. Increasing the probability OR increasing the payoff increases the expectation.

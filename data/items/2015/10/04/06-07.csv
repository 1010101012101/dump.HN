The 2005 Grand Challenge was more like NASCAR; all 24 teams who got there (including ours) had something that basically worked.  But 2004 was just pathetic. It was covered by the Comedy Channel.<p>Here&#x27;s my post-mortem on the 2004 event.[1]<p>The CMU debacle was amusing. To prevent pre-planning, each team got the route, as a set of GPS waypoints, a few hours before the start. The CMU team&#x27;s approach was that they&#x27;d obtained aerial photographs of the entire region, and had a semitrailer full of people and workstations to manually plan the route just before the event.<p>DARPA, however, had other plans. The event staff (mostly active-duty US Marines) had moved some obstacles around just before the event, to prevent exactly what CMU was trying.  You can see the result in the link below, as the CMU vehicle plowed right into a solid sheet of corrugated steel.

What is wrong with the fact that humility is  mentioned 43% less. Why is that automatically bad( I am not saying it is good either)? Values of a society change over period of time, many things that were acceptable behavior in the 1900s are not acceptable anymore. In the early 1900s black people were disenfranchised, there were no laws to protect same sex partners. I am sure many of you will agree that you dont miss those laws.<p>Again why do we want to demonize or characterize not having a quiet ego as less superior to having a quiet ego.

And you just have to look at European cities to see that transit can be the more convenient option when space for streets is limited. E.g. i&#x27;m living close to a soccer stadium that has no parking lot. Hard to imagine in the US. But the city is criss-crossed wirh subway lines, and it ishence  often the fastest way to get to a destination. Then the argument for cars breaks down.",1443939216

My girlfriend also watches those horrible Asian romance dramas and (jokes notwithstanding) I'm pretty sure the reason is more to fulfill her sappiness quota and not to cure her deep aching loneliness.<p>I think its more notable for its interesting game mechanic and the utterly evil method they have for getting high page counts per user. (I mean, it seems that the company just implied you advance in the game by looking at pages you wouldn't have looked at normally. Devious!)",1221994720

Not developers.</i><p>When people own computers, they want applications available -- the more the better. Remember the ""10,000 programs"" television ad for the Apple II?<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22apple+ii%22+%2210%2C000+programs%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22apple+ii%22+%2210%2C000+pr...</a><p>The decision to buy a computer is mainly based on the size of the application-base. The early-adopters are anticipating rapid application-base growth. To grow the application base, one needs developers.

310329,comment,310163,310286,0,0,litewulf,,,"Actually, I think as company's get bigger, they don't hear the ""I am frustrated by X"", they see ""ohhh we made HOW MUCH this year?""<p>I'm sure that Apple is peopled with nice guys and all, but seriously developers are a drop in the bucket (and thus easy to ignore). Either they stand up for themselves or they are going to keep getting abused. All the talk of how developing for Apple is sharecropping is moot because people <i>keep developing</i>.<p>Also, the ""still pretty compelling for a business to hear""? If users said that to me I'd love it, because it means I got them. They're paying money for something that they actually disagree with. That says something about hitting the right pain points and such.",1221994262

80893,comment,80836,80854,0,0,gduffy,,,"> Sure, every single one of them is written by a guy who knows the difference between private working set and shared memory ...<p>I think this is a pretty big assumption. Anybody can create a Windows service in visual studio in about 3 clicks.<p>Also, these other services may hook things in Windows, hold on to a bunch of handles, constantly poll for things, etc. We <i>really</i> try to be well-behaved in XobniService. It uses a single thread, sleeps the majority (about 99.96%) of the time, has few private bytes, and will probably be swapped out to disk most of the time (unless nothing else needs the memory). So XobniService has virtually nil impact on performance, besides an extra entry in task manager.<p>If Windows had a workable cron implementation, I'd just have used that.<p>I'm thinking about removing it anyway, despite the low impact on performance, since user perception is obviously important. I've been thinking of some workable alternatives, but they don't provide as nice an update experience.<p>If it's really the only thing keeping you away, you can Start/Run 'sc delete XobniService' and the Outlook plugin will still work just fine. You may not receive future updates this way, though.<p>Thanks for the feedback, hope you come back to us :)",1195279076

80882,comment,79965,79965,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I agree with optimal's comment: Don't throw any files away for at least six months. Let your emotions cool down, there may be quite a bit that can be salvaged or recycled. Write up a personal list of lessons learned, so that you can translate your mental ""if only"" to ""next time."" Review the list every few months as you gain more perspective and revise it. Try and stay friendly with everyone involved, even if they are blaming you for the moment. With time and some perspective you may reach some different conclusions about what really happened (and what you will do differently next time). There is a quote by Eric Hoffer I find useful:<p>Our Achievements Speak For Themselves.<p>What we have to keep track of are our failures, discouragements, and doubts.  We tend to forget the past difficulties, the many false starts, and the painful groping.  We see our past achievements as the end result of a clean forward thrust, and our present difficulties as signs of failure and decay.",1195275904

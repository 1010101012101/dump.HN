491507,comment,491116,491116,0,0,voidpointer,,,"The absence of something like a ""Java Pet Store"" for FP was what drove the topic for my MSc dissertation that I finished last year: I basically implemented a simple set of requirements for a publishing-workflow system in both Java and Haskell and then set out to evaluate the differences that the two approaches had from a software engineering perspective [<a href=""http://www.lars-oppermann.com/dis/dis-lopperma-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lars-oppermann.com/dis/dis-lopperma-final.pdf</a>].<p>The Haskell version turned out to be much more compact and some parts of the business logic could be expressed in a really straightforward way. The Haskell version also had a meta-programming based mechanism for automatically deriving and parsing XML representations of the domain objects. The persistence layer could also be made very unobtrusive due to Haskell's type-classes.<p>Nevertheless, the absence of extensible data types and the clunkiness of Haskell's record system made the domain model rather unwieldy. This is not a necessary limitation of FP. It rather seems that most users of FP today don't need such facilities because they are not normally building systems that require these kind of models.<p>It's also very important to note that object oriented programming and FP are not conflicting. Mainstream OOP languages tend to embrace an imperative execution model (Turing Machines) and FP languages are modeled around Lambda Calculus. Projects like Scala show how FP and OOP can augment each other nicely.",1235385592

Many people call a startup even outside projects and websites made for fun.<p>PG says ""The essential task in a startup is to create wealth"", that pretty well rules tarsnap out as a startup, I guess.",1235385515
491505,comment,490609,490692,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"| So how does an entrepreneur who is bursting with good ideas surpass this obstacle?<p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately ... business has been good to me, and I'm on my first ""cusp"" -- the point where I've got too much business to handle, but not enough resources to expand -- and so I've found that I'm starting to get ahead of myself in thinking about what's going to happen next.<p>The thing about good ideas is, they're almost worthless by themselves. They're only one part of a much larger formula involving things like hard work, dedication, focus, and good teams.<p>The funny thing about more money is, it doesn't really make any of the other parts of the formula any easier. A little, maybe -- I'd love to have just a few thousand dollars extra to cover my first employee's paychecks and do a little marketing -- but it's not going to make sure that I keep working hard, or that I stay focused on the task-at-hand, or that I remain dedicated to my purpose.<p>So, to get back to your question, an entrepreneur needs to write down their good ideas, when they have them, and then remind themselves to get back to work, and realize that funding is just one minor obstacle, and solving that one won't make their business much more viable.",1235385487

491499,comment,490609,491396,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Bingo!<p>Although this describes something of a subset of the current economic situation, I think it's still safe to say that there is a lot of money available for ""the next Google"" (or Intel, or...). The problem isn't the money, it's figuring out who the next big players are going to be.<p>I mean, hell, is this not directly demonstrated by the entire YC process? Here's a model in which there's a very reasonably-sized fund available, and an entire business set up around trying to determine who's got a good potential product, and who hasn't, and then assist the ones that maybe have a chance.",1235384919

491497,comment,490609,491091,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I disagree that the number of startups around are constrained in any way by funding. Or, at least, the number of viable startups.<p>I think there are far more important things on the list of stuff that new startups need, like business guidance and planning, structure, strategy. There are so many avenues right now for ""cheap"" startups -- using AWS, for example -- that I just can't see that throwing more money at the problem will help at all.<p>And, even in the case of ""expensive"" startups -- those that need serious capital for manufacturing or prototyping -- they need a strong business plan and a solid structure before they need money.<p>I suspect that pouring money into the startup sector would have a result very similar to the dot-com boom and bust cycle, and we don't need another of those right now.",1235384599

I think working for yourself, on (mostly) your own terms on your own product that you're passionate about is more meaningful than the box you might one day tick next to millionaire.<p>There's no risk in failure either, you can always go and work for someone else, and personal bankruptcy isn't _THAT_ bad.<p>I don't think PG is giving anyone false hope that they'll hit the lottery - he's just offering an alternative.

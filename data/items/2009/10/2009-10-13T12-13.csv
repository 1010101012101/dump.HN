After that I guess you have some choices, go into management, maybe slowly ride the slope down while holding your own against the 'new kids on the block' because of your longer experience.<p>It seems to be a pattern, but if you think that that is a wrong assumption then I'm all ears to hear about it.<p>Last I looked the sharpest cookies where all well under 45, and most programmers that are over 50 are really on the way out.

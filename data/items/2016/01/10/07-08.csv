There&#x27;s a long history of people discriminating based on race, sex, class, etc. and pretending they&#x27;re using an unbiased algorithm instead. The word redlining comes from the practice of using geography to make decisions. It&#x27;s obvious to most people that geography is highly correlated with race and class. Therefore, even if geography itself carries no intrinsic bias, to use geography as a variable in evaluating credit-worthiness is discriminatory.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining</a>",1452412711

So a driver often isn&#x27;t actually related to running a particular piece of hardware.  Rather, it&#x27;s a piece of software that needs kernel-mode access to the system.<p>Two examples that demonstrate this point well:<p>- There are various tools out there that you can use to perform a live memory capture on a Windows system; not just doing a memory dump of a single process, but doing a live memory dump of the whole system without having to halt or reboot.  I&#x27;ve used one of these and it works by loading a &#x27;driver&#x27; component when it is run that does the memory capture from kernel-mode (it requires Admin elevation to run, obviously).<p>(For examples, see: \n<a href=""http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Tools:Memory_Imaging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Tools:Memory_Imaging</a><p>I don&#x27;t remember if it was one off this list that I tried though).<p>Another example: A friend of mine had a system that would inexplicably BSOD if he left it running for a long while, unattended (especially overnight).  We initially suspected perhaps a heating issue (it was a small Intel NUC).  After setting up for full memory dumps and then analyzing them after a BSOD occurred using WinDbg, we actually found out that the BSOD was being caused by a kernel-mode component of the anti-virus suite that he had installed -- I think at the time it was BitDefender, but not sure.  When he consulted the AV vendor support website, I believe it turned out to be a known issue with a fix.<p>On my own systems, by far the largest cause of BSODs (of the few that I&#x27;ve seen over the last couple of years) has been RAM going bad.  These typically manifest as BSODs out of the blue that seem to come from different modules each time they happen, or they come from a module deep in the system that &#x27;shouldn&#x27;t&#x27; have crashes.  My personal rule is, if I see one, be vigilant.  If I see another one, reboot and run MemTest86.",1452410351

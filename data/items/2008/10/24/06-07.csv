He gets a tax free income for life, and when he dies, the charity gets what's left. It also saves him 3.3 million dollars in federal capital gains taxes. It is shrewd but not particularly ascetic.",1224831155

(offtopic: Google ""times smaller than"" in the next couple hours to get a peak into how Google seems to be ranking sites... I was surprised to see this topic was 60% of the first page)<p>2) Outbound links! Please, people, this is what the internet is about!<p>3) This is an interesting article. Unfortunately because of a lack of (2) it's hard to tell if they're making an effort to do this in a way that supports a wide array of instruments (an instrument synthesis API would be pretty cool), or if this research has a more limited scope.<p>I admit I don't know enough about sound and music to speak intelligently about what this research could do, but it seems like they could abstract it to multiple classes of instrument and open a whole new field of synthesizing instruments that sound like they should exist but don't. I'm thinking of the sound equivalent of the Memristor -- the (1940s?) math and physics showed that it is possible but nobody had made one until >2006.",1224830921
342150,comment,339755,341627,0,0,jyothi,,,"I understand pretty well what I am bringing up here. If you did follow the saga during the protests against quota system - there are two broad categories GM & OBC. No government entity can deny admission to OBC. As for as GM goes - in some institutes where applicants have to go through interviews or they are recruited on a demand basis there is always a huge influence of clan - which makes the concentration of Brahmin clan.<p>Regarding distribution of castes in the entire population - it is of no interest. We are speaking only of the institutes - IISc, ISRO, DRDO and that it is skewed with Brahmins and SC/ST. Additionally, existence is not same as power/ influence. I can bet the environment looks better at any of the IITs or RECs. That should suffice as a response.<p>Please follow up offline (Again I think u joined yesterday just to fire this debate with no info on profile) if u do want to fire a debate or do some follow up or walk into IISC or ISRO. I think HN is not a right place.",1224830875

342142,comment,341688,342057,0,0,gaius,,,"There are a lot of papers who can reasonably make that claim (e.g. The Times here in England). The problem, structually, is that newspapers in general are retailers of wholesale product provided by PA, AFP, Reuters, etc etc. Their value-add is in their original content, and that tends to be quite localised i.e. it doesn't scale. I worked in Manhattan for a while, I still have friends there, I enjoy reading that content in the NYT but I've no plans to go back and I wouldn't pay for that content (tho' I will see ads which I will ignore). Original content is expensive to produce. <i>That</i> is the problem for newspapers.",1224829862

A lot of the culture problems he alluded to could have been prevented by keeping the team smaller and increasing team ownership.<p>It's great to be a founder and own 100%.

The reason Gulf 1 went so well is that the Coalition played to its strengths: air and armour in open country.

342129,comment,341971,342119,0,0,palish,,,"But it seems like you'll also go nuts.  If you impose a polyphasic sleep schedule on yourself, you must follow it without fail.  And that means a 15-minute nap every N hours.  It doesn't matter if you're watching a movie, or out with friends, or ""in the flow"".  If you slip up, the whole sleep pattern comes crashing down.  So not many people have that much discipline, for one.<p>But even if you do, it doesn't seem possible for a human to work 100% of the time.  Each time I've tried, I simply end up wasting time rather than using it -- e.g. I'll stare at my computer screen for awhile thinking, try some minor change that doesn't work, then repeat the cycle over for a couple hours.  And the next day, my work has often proved to be shoddy at best when I was forcing myself to work.<p>On the other hand, I've had plenty of experiences that went like:  There's a bug to fix.  Can't seem to fix it.  Go to bed.  Wake up refreshed.  Spot the bug in ten minutes.<p>That seems pretty valuable as a time saver, so it doesn't seem wise to sacrifice your ""unwind"" time lightly.<p>I'm sorry.  I don't mean to sound like I'm coming down on you.  I'm merely trying to point out that, in the end, polyphasic sleep seems like a form of masochism -- and perhaps that's why Steve himself stopped doing it.",1224828261

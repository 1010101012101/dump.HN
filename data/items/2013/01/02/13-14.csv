But they are a good example of why context is important; the nautical mile is absolutely superior to the kilometer for use in navigation (at sea or in the air). Forcing the SI unit there would actually make the relevant tasks more complex and more difficult.",1357135197

In the MUD days (20+ years ago) this was called ""multiplaying"" and was usually forbidden, partly on grounds of this resource use, but some games did allow it. MMOs 10+ years ago saw an influx of people using GUI scripting tools to implement bots.  It's fairly obvious when it's happening and people really don't like it for the same reasons that they often don't like server-side bots in multiplayer games.<p>So realistically I believe this is a niche idea which might be hard to make commercially viable.

I'd consider using one every day for my commute however:-<p>* my commute would be right on the edge of 30 minutes (it's ~8 miles) and those bikes aren't the fastest (but that's good for training!). To be safe I'd have to break it up into two journeys with a 5 minute break in the middle to avoid being charged for 1 a usage on top of access. Or I can split it up into a cycle and then a run (good except that I sometimes I have to lug my work laptop with me which isn't idea for running).<p>* even with the upcoming (Spring 2014) extension to SW London I'm still going to be a 5 minute run from the nearest bikes. Right now it's a 4 mile run to the nearest docking station.<p>* no way to mount panniers, limited carrying space in the front 'basket' area, for bigger loads I'd need a rucksack and I much prefer panniers to a rucksack<p>90 for annual Barclays Bike access (and no hire fees) is roughly comparable to the wear and tear costs for my current bike (~4000 commuting miles a year, proportional costs for brake blocks, chains, chainrings, sprockets, rims, hubs, bottom bracket, [carbon] forks). It's certainly cheaper than ~900 for the annual train ticket.<p>Not having to worry about theft is a major plus, nor is having to carry good locks to lock up the bike should I have a mechanical that I can't fix quickly (I do the nursery run so I can't be home late).<p>I would also be helping the distribution problem as I'd be dropping off a bike near a major rail terminus in the morning, and using one from there to go home.",1357134729

For instance you can get a lot of 25 mm stuff in Europe that is almost equivalent to the 1 inch stuff you get in the US (1 inch = 25.4 mm) and similarly there is a lot of 30 cm and 60 cm stuff in stead of 1 foot and 2 feet stuff.",1357134525

There are probably a lot of business guys who <i>don't</i> know how to evaluate tech guys any more than tech guys know how to evaluate business guys.  It's probably not that hard to bullshit a business guy if you can talk convincingly about scalability, node.js, Clojure, Big Data, ""cloud"", etc.  A lot of solo business guys looking for technical co-founders will end up with sub-optimal technical co-founders because they don't know how to filter them out.<p>However, you're also right about the difficulties of identifying potential CEOs.  Part of the problem is that, due to the hierarchical nature of firms, there's simply a massive shortage of people with CEO experience - most firms employ just one CEO at a time.  This means that if you're looking for a CEO, you're probably going to have to take a chance on someone who hasn't done it before, and there's a much bigger experience gap between ""business guy with MBA"" and ""good CEO"" than there is between ""senior developer"" and ""technical co-founder"".  This shortage is (partly) why experienced CEOs get paid so much, and why the jump in compensation from ""business guy with MBA"" to ""CEO"" is much bigger than the jump from ""senior developer"" to ""CTO"".<p>This is also a problem for aspiring CEOs, because they can't prove themselves until they get a chance, and chances at CEO level are very rare.  The good potential CEOs can't easily differentiate themselves from the bad ones, and this also creates a perverse situation in which simply <i>faking</i> CEO potential doesn't have many disadvantages compared to actually being good.  Once you've been hired anywhere as a CEO, so long as you don't calamitously screw up, you're on the right side of the CEO scarcity problem.",1357134488

Feasible.<p>Volumes: people are used enough to 2-liter bottles of soda, expect the 3.78 liter milk to stay around for a while because of supply chains. Gas prices will be modestly interesting for people, but really easy on the industry.<p>Short distances/dimensions: now things get tricky and potentially expensive. There are a lot of fractional-dimensioned parts out there in industry in different supply chains.<p>Weights:\n2.2lb = 1kg and you're pretty good. Nobody <i>really</i> uses ounces anyway!<p>Temperature:\nHere's the thing about temperature: converting would be relatively useless because Real People don't do math with the temperature outside. Even scientists don't do math with the temperature outside all that much.

I'm in my thirties.<p>I do a person's height in casual conversation (on forms I write it in metres) and driving distance in Imperial measurements (often; I use kilometres when I'm talking to someone I trust to know what a kilometre is, which is generally anyone under about 40). I do depth and altitude in metres, but sometimes I'll use an old chart that has feet (or sometimes fathoms, but that's the really, really old charts). Volume, mass, everything else is metric. I know my mass in kg. I've only the vaguest idea what a ""stone"" is. A pound? An ounce? Those are twee measurements I sometimes see in old books. I know how much a litre is. I don't even know what the metric unit of volume is. Cubic inches? That seems clumsy even for Imperial units. At the supermarket, the unit used on the fruit, veg and meat is kilogrammes. Last weekend I was comparing pork by cost per kilogramme. Which supermarket do you shop at that uses... I don't even know what you'd use. Not stones, I guess? Pounds and ounces?  I remember at about age ten someone telling me the temperature in Fahrenheit, and having no idea whether that was hot or cold. I have less idea today of what it means.<p>Where this is going is that I thoroughly disagree.<p>Additional edits, for the fun of it:<p>""Though I bet you don't go to Asda and ask where you can find 2.272 litres of milk."" Fair enough. I do buy milk in pints. If they switched to 2 litre bottles, I'd still buy it, and frankly I'd prefer it if they did. At the moment, I have to look at the scale on the side of the milk marked in litres to see how much I'm pouring into something (because the recipe I'm using specifies litres or millilitres; maybe there's a whole dual-industry for recipes in which you get Imperial units and I get metric; I note that the recipes on the BBC list both units; Jamie Oliver's web page is metric, Delia Smith is both, Hairy Bikers are metric, I've given up looking after those high-ranking four, but I note that not one of them is this Imperial only thing you talked about).<p>""Do you ever do mile-per-gallon approximations for your fuel economy?"" Fair enough. I don't drive so this is a closed book to me.<p>""Do you ever buy a steak at a nice restaurant?"" Yes, often. I have never once specified a mass the steak is to have. That it is marked on the menu in crazy measurements has always seemed a twee restaurant kind of thing; cosmetic rather than meaningful. The meat at the supermarket is, of course, in kg.<p>""Have you ever played golf or football?"" Never golf, and football not since I was about ten. Perhaps we simply move in different circles. You're with the Imperials, I'm with the metrics.<p>""Where are you?"" Deep south. Hampshire. As a drifting aside, I note that London is now approximately 40% non-British born, so that presumably means that about 40% of people living in London have even less grasp of Imperial measurements than I do. Perhaps metric is more common in the south.<p>Steak update: I am sure I have specified the steak by name, and its name is ""Ten ounce"" or ""Eight ounce"" or whatever. It is as meaningful to me as ""Medium bowl of custard"" or ""large bowl of custard"", for example. If you gave me a big bucket of sand and asked me to put about ten ounces of sand in a cup, I'd have no idea at all. I seem to recall that I once saw an ounce of butter and it was kind of about ""this"" big"". I'd probably use that as a base.<p>Ramsay: A ha. Ramsay, of course, is Scottish.

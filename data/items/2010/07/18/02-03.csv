The problem you're alluding to --- the one that means ""SSL is worth jack shit"" --- is a user interface problem. It's a serious one, but not only does it <i>not go away</i> in a DNSSEC world, it actually gets far worse.<p>DNSSEC isn't a magic bullet that solves the logistical problems of verifying Internet identities. The market has been beating the crap out of mutual authentication for financial websites for over 15 years. The company with a real solution to that problem will make billions of dollars.  DNSSEC isn't that; it's a bunch of guys on a mailing list arguing about the one piece of the stack that they've chosen to fixate on --- and the surprisingly <i>bad</i> solution that resulted from the process.<p>This isn't just my opinion, by the way. Read every working group post (like I did) and watch Vixie's tone as the protocol evolves from what TIS came up with to where it is now, when he starts saying, in effect, ""anything, anything, let's just get something deployed!""",1279421597

1525120,comment,1480665,1483339,0,0,sedachv,,,"Someone asked me to explain why I think UCW is ""truly horrible"":<p>I think UCW is bad for three reasons: trying to hide the fact that\nHTTP is stateless with continuations, introducing way too many\nconcepts/mechanisms unrelated to actually serving pages, and I don't\nlike Marco Baringer's (original UCW author) code very much.<p>The third reason is subjective, the first two somewhat less so. I\nactually have a blog post with some diagrams in the idea stage about\nwhy managing HTTP web app state with continuations is a terrible idea\n(it all comes down to the fact that it makes it much harder to test) -\nalready noted criticisms include meaningless URLs (can't\nlink/bookmark), and harder debugging. Since UCW uses CPS\ntransformation to get continuations, it means the resulting code is\nalmost impossible to debug.<p>Next, look at the documentation for UCW:\n<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/repos/ucw-core/doc/getting-started.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/repos/ucw-core/doc/gettin...</a><p>Entry points? Components that need the MOP? Frames? Actions? Just to\nunderstand how components get output to HTML and served you need to\nknow the MOP. So you have the UCW component code, the UCW MOP code,\nthe UCW entry/continuation code, the UCW interface on top of an HTTP\nserver. Now you need to learn a whole new horribly complicated UI\ntoolkit and still deal with all the regular web stuff.<p>This isn't any different that Weblocks. The difference between\nWeblocks ""horrible"" and UCW ""truly horrible"" is in things like the UCW\nsystem definition file:\n<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/repos/ucw-core/ucw-core.asd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/repos/ucw-core/ucw-core.a...</a><p>The eval-when, the useless (but confusing - how is it different than\nregular defclass?) defclass* macro, the defvars completely unrelated\nto system definition.

Its existence pissed off their partners, it didn't sell extraordinarily well (I think being only really usable on T-Mobile, and eventually AT&T, caused that problem), and it has reportedly been discontinued. The Nexus One website recommends other phones for people who want to use the two biggest networks (Sprint and Verizon). And, of course, the networks kinda hated it because it undermined their position as arbiter of what goes on phones.<p>Of course, all the things that networks hated about it were things that consumers <i>should</i> have loved about it, and I wish there were a Nexus Two just around the corner...but I'm not holding my breath and when my contract ends in a couple of months, I'll buy whatever the latest generation Android phone from Sprint or Verizon happens to be.<p>Regardless, this is not a substantive article.",1279420717

My understanding is that the study primarily looked at cognitive performance during an extended period of wakefulness (40hrs).  Two doses of Modafinil (100mg each) were given during this period (the manufacturer recommended dose appears to be 100-400mg).<p>Modafinil improved the cognitive performance of Val/Val's (G,G)s across most of the tests (memory tests, mood tests, ""Vigor"" tests, reaction rate tests, well-being, fatigue, are ones i remember).  Met/Met's (A,A)s did not see any statistically significant improvement on most of the tests.  One test where there was a small effect for Met/Met's was in subjective well-being.<p>The study also looked at sleep recovery after the prolonged wakefulness.  All participants entered deep sleep faster than normal.<p>90% of Val/Val's correctly identified their group (placebo vs. drug).  66% of Met/Met's correctly identified their group.<p>There were 10 people in the Val/Val group and 12 in the Met/Met group.  But the small number of participants should be accounted for in the p-tests, as far as I know.<p>However, like you, I'd still try it given the chance.

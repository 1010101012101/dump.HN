Any code using those functions will compile against both.

You can't break compatibility without changing the function signatures, but if you change substantially all of the function signatures then it's arguably a completely independent API. More importantly, it seems like this would be more of a theoretical problem than one seen in practice -- the only practical reason to copy an API is to achieve partial or complete compatibility.

You need to walk for a good long while at a time to use up your glycogen (stored sugar energy) and make your body dip into fat reserves. So if you spread out getting your steps you are less likely to do that. Similarly, there are heart rate complications. If you don't walk fast enough or throw in some interval work to get your heart rate up, you aren't getting as much exercise...",1351966466
4737410,comment,4733972,4735214,1,0,shinratdr,,,"> I don't think that 2x faster GPU improves UX a lot for the average user.<p>I think that statement says more about Android fans than it does about ""the average users"". Who needs a fluid UI and responsiveness that can't be beat? That hardly affects the U-->X<-- which stands for experience let's not forget.<p>The way iOS works benefits heavily from an overpowered GPU because it was designed with hardware acceleration as a core consideration from the ground up. Android device manufacturers tend to spend that component funding where it counts in Android, bumping up the RAM to reduce slowdowns instead.<p>> And for me, 3G is fast enough (about 2Mbit/s where I live).<p>It's true, 640k of memory ought to be enough for anybody.<p>> Accurate maps are more important IMHO.<p>Good thing I have accurate maps then. Possibly the most overblown issue in history, the Apple Maps are actually fine. Weaker in most areas but stronger than I expected at launch, and good enough that I don't miss Google Maps.<p>If you think they're ""inaccurate"" then you're doing more tech-news reading than actual investigating. They're plenty accurate. Considering you have the world to work with, obviously this doesn't apply everywhere. However, neither does the conventional wisdom that Google maps is better. In certain areas that Google has neglected, Apple maps is already better right out of the gate.",1351966464

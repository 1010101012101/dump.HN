2) Mrs. B was growing old and her son Louie had taken over most of the work, she was still active in managing the carpet section
3) They were looking at a German company to take them over; their offer was $90.0 mn 
4) Buffet told them they would get a higher valuation if they waited and then laid out the pros and cons of Berkshire being in charge. Also pointed out that many other firms would have managers which would inevitably try and run the show.
5) BRK wanted them on as partners to run the firm, without bringing someone in from the outside, which is something both Louie and MRs. B wanted. She didn't want to sell to a German company, being a Russian immigrant.
5.1) T His is generally BRK policy, it invests in strong, track record proven companies and teams, after doing massive amounts of diligence on them.
6) She then told him she wanted $55.0 mn in cash, for 90.0% of the company. 
7) Buffet signed, with the caveat that if she wanted to change the deal she could. She said no.
8) Her son and his grandson stayed on and helped grow the business. 
9) At some point Mrs. B got very irritated with her growing lack of control, and when her son/grandsons overruled her on a carpet purchase decision she got mad and left.
10) She started her own business opposite the road and began to beat Furniture mart. Since Buffet did not take sides she was quite hurt and betrayed.
11) BRK pays her $5.0 mn for the name of her new mart, makes sure shes happy and in charge of furniture mart, and ensures her non compete clause is bullet proof.<p>Its an interesting story to read about, as is Mrs. B - she also had a laser focus on her expertise; she didn't care to go beyond it, and was extremely effective within it. She also made decisions quickly and never looked back.<p>Funnily, 20% of the stake was held by her daughters, and her sons-in-law came to sign the deal. They were aware they would get more if they signed with the Germans but Mrs. B basically harangued them into submission - ""how much do you want, I'll pay ya"".<p>Her management style was... interesting - Buffet had been told that she wanted to sell the place 20 years earlier. When he got there to sign the deal, Mrs B. had part of her office (may have been sons/in laws) lined up, just so that she could yell at them and call them a bunch of bums. Once she abused them enough, Buffet was allowed to walk away.",1301180231

Nate looks at the number of citations and draws some good conclusions - but I think he misses something important.<p>News aggregators, such as YC and Reddit sometimes link stories from New York Times, Bloomberg and Al Jazeera, but at any one time one of the big news outlets will be a small minority on the frontpage. Most of the content comes from blogs, smaller sites, comments somewhere and specific sites associated with a news event.<p>For instance, the recent nuclear disaster has been covered here on HN, but the links are often to sites that are somewhat specific to the event in questions. In this case sites like worldnuclearnews.org (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2348824"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2348824</a>) and theenergycollective (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2317356"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2317356</a>). Chances are that I will never visit these sites again, but for this one event they were indespensible.<p>If there was a biological terrorist attack in Copenhagen next week there's a good chance that The Copenhagen Post (<a href=""http://www.cphpost.dk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cphpost.dk/</a>) would make the frontpage of both Reddit and HN, but in there is not it won't. It's only an interesting source for very specific events.<p>The Internet is changing news, and I don't think Nate's analysis takes that into consideration, small sites won't show up in his analysis since they're typically only quoted in relation to one story. Because of News aggregators I don't get much of my news from the traditional outlets - I get it from experts on the particular piece of news I'm reading about. That expert may be wikipedia, it may be worldnuclearnews or it may be The copenhagen Post. The important thing is instead of getting a lot of my news from one source I get it from all over the place depending on what's happening in the world.<p>Besides I've often seen big news organizations pinch stories from Reddit without any attribution.",1301178740

2373336,comment,2372134,2372624,6,0,nostrademons,,,"There're similarities, but also quite a few differences as well.  Airlines are a commodity business: the service Southwest sells is essentially the service United sells.  Tech at the micro scale is very much differentiated: the service DropBox sells is very different from the service that AirBnB sells, which is very different from the service Google sells.<p>Tech is also weird in that software <i>development</i> has significant <i>dis</i>economies of scale, while software <i>operations</i> has significant economies of scale.  Small teams can develop a product faster, but once the product exists and has been proven in the marketplace, it's cheaper to scale from 100 servers to 100,000 servers than it was to go from 1 server to 100 servers.  This has historically fueled the cycle of small tech startups being founded, gaining traction, getting bought, and then the founders quitting to found other small startups.  It's economically rational for them to do so, because they can develop a product faster with a small team than inside a big organization.<p>I'm curious how the existence of cloud-hosting like Amazon EC2 will change this market.  That's had the effect of splitting software development and software operations into separate markets: before, it used to be cheaper to integrate them into one firm, but now a commodity product exists that makes it feasible for the development firm to remain independent and simply pay a fee for all the operations support.<p>I suspect it's actually bad for startups in the long run, much like the power loom was bad for textile manufacturers.  Since there're economies of scale to operations, that side of the market will tend to a few big players (right now Amazon has a virtually monopoly, and only a couple others even have the capability to offer something like that), while the startup side will tend towards many small firms.  In a situation like that, the big firms have all the bargaining power, and so most of the profits will accrue to them.",1301177001

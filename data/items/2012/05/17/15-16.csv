Not because they're great and the world needs to know, but mostly because someone, somewhere, might come across it and get something out of it.<p>Though this difference between ""open-source project"" and ""putting code out there"" is where I'm not sure what companies/recruiters think about when they say ""open source contributions is a plus"".

During that evaluation he was found to have the speech impediment, and was flagged as requiring further screening for occupational therapy and ADHD.  We have not yet done that screening.<p>My understanding is that an important part of that screening is a patient history and impressions from caregivers.  Every caregiver has identified the same thing.  He's plenty smart and has a great attention span for what interests him, but simply doesn't follow direction.  Not in a, ""kids don't listen"" sort of way.  But in the kind of way which causes the teacher in parent-teacher conferences to get all serious and spend the session talking about how she has more problems with him than with the rest of a class of 24 kids.<p>Having talked with my sister, whose son had very severe ADHD, I've been forced to admit that the symptoms fit.  (My son is clearly not as severe though.)  But it isn't official until he gets the official screening for it.<p>As for what to do about it, my sister spoke highly of cognitive therapy.  She understands our resistance to drugs, had the same herself, but points out that drugs are optional and only needed as a temporary stopgap to give therapy a chance.

If it wasn't for that last requirement, I'd already be trying to sell Python to my boss; as it stands, if I can't find some really awesome static analysis and verification tools for Python</i><p>I think one can make a case that Groovy comes pretty damn close, and at least <i>as</i> close as any other ""scripting language on the JVM.""<p>Platform:  Well, it's the JVM.<p>Wide Adoption:  Define ""wide?""  But from what I can see, Groovy is pretty popular, especially Grails.  There are plenty of books on Groovy/Grails, Grails meetups / users groups in many cities, an active community of developers, etc.  There are even consulting companies that focus on Groovy and Grails.  SpanTree in Chicago, IL come to mind.<p>Familiar Syntax:  Groovy is great in this regard, as almost any .java file can be renamed to .groovy and compiled with groovyc.  Most of the syntax that's different between Java and Groovy is optional in Groovy, so you can start off writing Groovy that is very Java-like and slowly evolve to more idiomatic Groovy over time.<p>Maintainability:  No better or worse than any other dynamic language, IMO.  If you have access to metaprogramming and duck-typing and what-not, there opportunity for abuse is there.  But Groovy's culture does not seem to be big on a lot of BFM.<p><i>hard to really fuck things up too badly</i> - hmm... that's pretty subjective, but to that point, Groovy does have unit-testing tools, static analysis tools, etc. available.  The ecosystem might not quite as rich as of that for pure Java, but I think you can find what you need to create a sane development environment.",1337268689

What I don't want to go back to is the day in which no one had any idea how well any teacher was teaching, because no one was looking, and no one was looking because parents couldn't shop for schools anyhow. If parents can make global evaluations of what is good for each of their children, better incentives exist to improve teaching, improve school administration, and improve all other aspects of the school experience.<p>Returning to the other comment's thoughtful question,<p><i>If you give the parents the ability to ""shop"", what happens when everyone thinks that teacher X is the best English teacher for 7th grade and they ALL want their kids in her class?</i><p>that is precisely the kind of situation that builds curiosity among other teachers about ""What is that teacher doing that I'm not doing?"" and among administrators about, ""What value do families perceive in that class that they don't perceive in our classes?""<p>As other comments have already pointed out, parents in all countries of the world shop for schools at least by how they choose their residence addresses. But decoupling school choices from residence choices allows schools and families to respond more efficiently to their own mix of trade-offs. When many shoppers prefer one grocery store to another, and take their business to the better grocery store, what usually happens is that the worse grocery store changes the way it does business and improves its overall customer value proposition for shoppers. As I noted above, one HUGE problem with schools all over the United States, even schools in states that do not formally have ""union shops"" with mandatory schoolteacher union membership, is that administrators have little flexibility in reassigning teachers to the work that they do the best. So today is a somewhat slow process at the margins for schools to improve (by realigning staff assignments) as families shop for the best classrooms. But I've seen what Minnesota school districts have been able to do even within the limitations of the current system, and I'm confident that adding incentive for school improvement by giving learners more power to shop makes as much sense (as a matter of basic public policy) as it does for providing most other services.<p>AFTER EDIT: Commentary on the link submitted here by a blogger based in New York City,<p><a href=""http://nycrubberroomreporter.blogspot.com/2012/05/carolyn-abbott-best-worst-8th-grade.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nycrubberroomreporter.blogspot.com/2012/05/carolyn-ab...</a><p>which I learned about from a Facebook friend who lives in New York State and has been following the controversy on school testing in New York State closely.",1337267538

It's an analog computer for solving scheduling and flow problems, i.e. finding the critical path. The arrows show dependencies, and you turn a knob to set how long a task takes. The computer computes the critical path and the float (slack) time. It's implemented as a corresponding network of voltages sources and diodes, where the voltage at a point indicates time. A plotter creates a time graph as output. The computer is programmed through a plugboard and cables.<p>This is described in patent 3250902, which is actually pretty clearly written.",1337267034

I think the first buzz he received was on thirty day trials and (in particular) polyphasic sleep.<p>He's always been a bit unorthodox, but he wrote a book that I found to have quite a bit of value, and was quite a bit more challenging in its exercises than the standard self-help book.<p>I still read him, but more for the occasional nuggets now - for where I am in life, I don't receive much value from his current set of posts because it isn't where I am right now in life. That's okay.<p>As for the passive income bit, I'm hoping the series gets better, but I fear it is going to be a repackaging of what he's said before.",1337266950

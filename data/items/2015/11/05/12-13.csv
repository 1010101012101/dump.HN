10513025,comment,10506484,10511198,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Computer aided dispatch.  Essentially all trains are monitored via control centers owned by a few of the larger railroads.  Passenger traffic is even handed off through these centers when crossing the territories.<p>And yes dark territory is what they call the areas that are unmonitored. Usually these are way out in the middle of no where on single track.  Most monitoring believe it or not is hard wired and not wireless. For example, hot box detectors which are basically buried on the inside of the tracks monitor a trains bearing/axel temperatures and can report if one is over heating. This is critical because it is a source of derailments.  Those boxes though usually are wired directly to lines running along the track and back to a common point. In many cases a number of lines terminate at one location and are fed to radio towers that beam that data back. In other cases it follows the fiber all the way to a rail yard or dispatch center.<p>I can&#x27;t say now what the differences are with PTC in Europe, but I know when I was at GE we looked a lot at what they were doing because in most cases they are far more serious about their railroads.",1446728389

10513017,comment,10506103,10512541,0,0,acqq,,,"Most programmers who just read about the leap second and don&#x27;t get enough information seem to miss this:<p>If you use time() function as POSIX defines it you already now get the &quot;sane&quot; number of seconds for the common calculations: to get the day after and the same time just  always add 86400 seconds. It was so even at the day the last leap second happened (June 30, 2015). So the commonly used algorithms don&#x27;t have to care. We already use the time as the astronomical time, add 86400 seconds and get the expected time a day after, and that there were 9e9 more oscillations of the Ce 133 atom between these two datetimes compared to other days we don&#x27;t have to care.<p>Only if you change your system not to be POSIX compliant the calculations aren&#x27;t obvious. Just don&#x27;t do it.<p>The system as it is now, with the leap seconds happening, works. Who needs to care about TAI already cares. No need changing it.<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/01/torvalds_leapsecond/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2015/01/torvalds_leapsecond/</a><p>&quot;You’d have to teach people to not care about the correlation of time to the sun, or the correlation of dates to the seasons. That doesn’t sound very realistic.<p>The people and computers who really care about “atomic” time tend to be astronomers. For the rest of us – both people and computers – we’re probably better off taking the POSIX approach to it, and just say “who cares”, with a few unlucky people worrying about bugs happening because of the perversities of timekeeping.&quot;",1446728282

There would no doubt be some successful candidates that emerged from such a program.<p>The practical bar to that is my belief that any such single-company program would be utterly uncompetitive versus other efforts I could make in staffing. Opening an out of country office, while hard, is probably much less work per successful candidate, has a higher success rate, and often presents much more compelling economics.<p>If the above is remotely true, the shortest path to better prospects for minorities is to increase their college attendance, STEM majors, and graduation rates. It also has the practical advantage of having a high level of self-determination and influence; rather than waiting for me to fix their problem (where I necessarily have many competing priorities), they can take initiative to address their problem (where they naturally have more focus and vested interest in the specific outcome).<p>There is unlikely to emerge a single-company Cinderella type program that will markedly change the industry. The overhead costs are too much and the successes too few. A regional (or even national) charitable or educational institution may be able to move the needle (but even there, the shorter path might well be &quot;encourage college and STEM participation rates&quot;)",1446727413

Other times I just felt like it, or I didn&#x27;t know a viable alternative existed.<p>I remember when I was working on a web server project in the late nineties, one of my first commercial gigs, the whole thing was done in Borland Delphi. As the maintenance programmer came in to take over, he berated me publicly several times for not using regular expressions to do string manipulation. The language did not even have regex support as far as I recall, and as he replaced my very simple and easily-debuggable string routines with absurd regexes in combination with an arcane regex library, I felt like the most worthless programmer ever. Worse yet, people were praising him for his assertiveness and competence. And then following his &quot;refactoring&quot;, over the next weeks, horrible string manipulation bugs and exploits started happening in production. Turns out, he introduced lots of problems and nobody could fix them. As far as I know the project was plagued with these kinds of bugs until it went offline years later.<p>The loudest hecklers are often the most successful at projecting an appearance of competence that may not necessarily be warranted. They derive energy and peer recognition from publicly berating colleagues for decisions. Whether they are factually correct or not, little is gained by letting them drag you down.<p>It&#x27;s not the end of the world.

In the US the default is a washed product.<p>But (!) this is why the default in the US is to have eggs refrigerated from soon after they leave the farm - and they need to remain refrigerated.  IIRC this is because eggs that come from ~3C back to room temperature (~21C) will condense, and on washed eggs this massively increases the risk of pathogens penetrating the eggs.<p>On non-washed eggs, this is less of a concern - but here we still recommend to not relocate eggs from the fridge to room temperature unless we&#x27;re about to eat them.   The membrane, though, will prevent spoilage of eggs that haven&#x27;t been washed (or refrigerated) for weeks, if not months, if kept at a reasonable room temperature.  (I qualify reasonable as here in AU room temperature in summer can often reach 35C.)",1446726386

IME it amounts to (roughly) the same thing as Rust&#x27;s borrowck rules, just that Rust forces you to think about this a priori, in a clean framework with clear rules, instead of wibbly wobbly, pointy-wointy, ... stuff.<p>The things you feel safe to do in Rust are often a superset of the things you feel safe to do in C++. Most large codebases often use lots of shared_ptr or equivalent, whereas in Rust Rc and RefCell are broken out only when necessary (when the compiler tells us there&#x27;s no way to do it the borrow way).<p>So while C++ might let you write a larger variety of non-UB patterns in principle, Rust will let you write more non-UB patterns <i>in practice</i>. You feel safe playing fast and loose with the references, and dancing near the line of safe behavior since the compiler ensures you never cross it. I have a post illustrating an example of this here: <a href=""http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-really-shines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-real...</a><p>And, of course, if you really want to express one of those &quot;things C++ lets you do&quot; wrt pointers, you can always break out `unsafe`.",1446726008

To intuit that the algorithm must be exponential, imagine the vertices to be balls on wire. You grab one ball pull it up as the root from which you start to compare. Now it is obvious you have to pick a vertex from the other graph as well to be the root nice from which to begin the comparison, if you pick the wrong one the graphs won&#x27;t match. So you will have to pick every ball and see if its structure matches. For a tree (a graph without cycles) it&#x27;s plain to see it&#x27;s exponential: in the worst case you have to pick each vertex from one graph and then compare its children with the other graph, that&#x27;s N * N operations.

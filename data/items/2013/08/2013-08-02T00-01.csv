6144755,comment,6143322,6144669,5,0,Balgair,,,"My brother got a TS. It took him about a year to get the thing. He had no clue what the TS part of the company was like before &#x27;stepping through the rabbit-hole.&#x27; He worked at the job just fine for a few years. One day, he said he knew he had to look for other work. It took him a few months to find a way to leave. Eventually, he just quit without any job at all. He has a job now, not nearly as glamorous but he is employed.<p>Just because they work for a contractor for the NSA, or they have a TS or S or Q clearance, doesn&#x27;t mean they are not very smart and hard working. Hell, you know they went through the ringer to prove they are trustworthy and loyal. Because they wanted to help out all of us here in the US and then they felt they could no longer, that does NOT mean they should be punished. What did they themselves do wrong?<p>Besides, this is ONE program the NSA runs. Mostly likely the majority of the TS cleared people out there have nothing to do with all this stuff. Those people do make a lot of sacrifices for their job and for the US. A lot are multiply divorced because of the stress, the secrecy, and the unpredictability of the job.<p>&quot;Hey Sugar, gotta go.

Individual family members can be configured for particular markets; the Gold mentioned in the talk is indeed somewhat Big Data oriented, with eight ALUs and only two FPUs. A High Silver, with six FPUs and a SIMD height of 256 bits, is an FP banger. A Tin, with one ALU, no FPU, and 8-byte SIMD, is at the low end.<p>There is an architectural minimal size to Mills; there must be at least one ALU and one memory unit, and all Mills must use a 64-bit address; the z80 market is safe from us, and you won&#x27;t see Mills in your toaster or thermostat.

Solum is a venture-backed start-up headquartered in the SOMA district of San Francisco. The company also has a significant presence in Ames, Iowa, where it operates a state-of-the-art soil testing laboratory. The company is backed by Khosla Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures. Our team of 25 people are experts from a broad set of disciplines -- software development, data science, chemistry, physics, agronomy, and business.<p>Since the introduction of precision farming technology and techniques over 15 years ago, advanced growers and their advisors have generated significant volumes of geospatial data about their soils, crops and yields. However, the current industry desktop software packages make it difficult to manage this data and turn it into actionable information. Solum is developing a cloud and mobile-first software platform that will greatly simplify the transport, storage, analysis, and sharing of precision agriculture data. Solum&#x27;s intuitive interface gives crop advisors and growers access to the information they need to make critical agronomy and farm management decisions in the field.",1375404785

Is the discovery process reliable enough that we&#x27;d want to require patent holders to depend on it?  After all, in such a case, the infringer knows they&#x27;re infringing and can expect a lawsuit -- it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be that hard to destroy any evidence of reverse engineering in advance.<p>Here&#x27;s another alternative: require that the plaintiff in an infringement case show objective evidence that their invention was nonobvious.<p>Basically, this means admitting that the PTO is only a first-level filter and removing the presumption that a granted patent is valid; the patent holder would have to defend their patent in order to litigate it.  Along with that, we put some teeth into the nonobviousness requirement by <i>requiring</i> some evidence along the lines laid out in Graham v. Deere: commercial success, long-felt but unsolved needs, or failure of others.  (In software, publication of a paper in a recognized journal or conference proceedings would probably be a common form of evidence.)<p>Like your proposal, this would be a huge change that would make most extant software patents worthless.  But it doesn&#x27;t depend on discovery to determine malfeasance by the defendant.  What do you think?",1375404525

6144701,comment,6140729,6144338,1,0,rlpb,,,"> working at the level of plain text analysis rather than semantic analysis does limit how much our tools can achieve.<p>We can add semantic analysis. I have no problem with that. But removing or harming the ability to do text analysis might not stop us from using more sophisticated tools, but it does stop us from putting tools together quickly in a way not previously predicted. This is why Unix is so powerful. If you haven&#x27;t read The Art of Unix Programming, I urge you to do so. It puts the argument and examples forward far more convincingly than I can.<p>Would moving to semantic tools harm the ability to use our existing text-based tools? I&#x27;d say so. A simple tool like diff works better, for example, if you take your big list of Python imports and put each one on a separate line, and keep them sorted. Patching works smoother this way too, reducing the likelyhood of the need for manual conflict resolution. If we eliminate doing this kind of arrangement by hand, and instead start relying on a semantic editor, we&#x27;ll lose this ability. I have yet to see a tool that does semantic diffs, patches and merges better than diff, patch and git do.",1375404203

This &quot;standardization&quot; is a huge source of power since how the problem is handled becomes predictable, less likely to contain bugs and generally leads to a more composable code.<p>Take the Maybe monad for example. I&#x27;m sure that as you&#x27;ve programming you&#x27;ve found yourself constantly checking for an undefined or null argument/parameter value at the beginning of a function. Sometimes people just return false, null or undefined. Other people return errors. Some throw exceptions. The Maybe monad gives you a typeclass that allows some data to be Just the value you want or nothing. Since you have a standard way of having something be undefined and it&#x27;s encoded in the datatype itself, you never really have to handle undefined values in other functions. Why? Because these other functions that work with the Maybe monad don&#x27;t really operate on the value directly. Instead they operate on the value via the Maybe monad&#x27;s fmap function.<p>Check out this post for a good explanation of some monads:<p><a href=""http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_...</a><p>This too:<p><a href=""http://adit.io/posts/2013-06-10-three-useful-monads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adit.io/posts/2013-06-10-three-useful-monads.html</a><p>From now on, whenever you see a new monad, ask yourself what generalizable programming problem or idiom it is trying to encapsulate and why it&#x27;s important to solve that programming problem. With the case of the Maybe monad I mentioned above, you can read up on a lot of the literature out there explaining why the invention of null was a terrible. C.A.R. Hoare calls it his billion dollar mistake.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the problem being solved, understanding the abstraction presented by a particular monad is going to be a lot harder.",1375403733

(I&#x27;m not talking about Moto X&#x27;s low-power DSP cores, I&#x27;m talking about having 4 Krait or ARM 15 cores)<p>GPU cores are different because GPU workloads are automatically parallelizable, but then again, you only need as many GPU cores as it takes to drive average workloads at the given pixel density. It makes no sense to include enough GPU to render a game at 250 frames per second. Developers are most likely not going to spend time optimizing a game for a high end GPU like it was some kind of console in a fragmented market like Android.<p>Point is, one should look at these phones from a practical standpoint and ignore the spec sheets. Does it take good pictures? Does it feel fast? Does the screen look good? Does the battery last long? Does it feel good to hold and lightweight?

6144634,comment,6139863,6144185,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"What&#x27;s particularly ... peculiar ... about economics is the degree to which specific elements of it have been so vigorously adopted, promulgated, and defended by certain sectors.<p>I&#x27;m still digging into the history behind Ricardo, but briefly:<p>- He was an ideological opponent (though apparently close personal friend) of Robert Malthus.  Malthus strongly criticized Ricardo&#x27;s theories, and repeatedly questioned their inclusion in the Encyclopedia Britannica, suggesting they wouldn&#x27;t stand the test of time.<p>- Malthus himself became strongly criticized by Ricardo&#x27;s supporters.  Much of that <i>present</i> criticism focuses on Malthus&#x27;s writings on population, though these largely focused on the poor, and expressed a viewpoint not much different from Ricardo&#x27;s.  But by focusing the attention here, Malthus&#x27;s own criticism of Ricardo is distinctly underrepresented.  Compare this with Helen Keller, whose notability to most people is her role as an advocate for the rights of the disabled.  Her actual attentions during her life were in support of socialism.  For some reason, that message doesn&#x27;t make it into elementary school texts....<p>- Ricardo&#x27;s principle work was his theory of rent, which focused attention on landowners and laborers, suggesting that capitalists would be left wanting in allocations of wealth.<p>- Ricardo&#x27;s own wealth came from stock speculation and banking.  He later bought a parliamentary seat, according to Toynbee (I&#x27;m not sure how unusual a practice this was at the time), and used his MP position to advocate for his political economy (as the study was called at the time) views.<p>- Ricardo&#x27;s papers and letters were collected by John Ramsey McCulloch, and subsequently bought by Lord Overton, another banker.  They&#x27;re now hosted by a number of largely libertarian-leaning organizations including the Ludwig von Mises Institute and Online Library of Liberty.<p>Again:  my working hypothesis is that much of economics is more a too for justifying allocation of resources to benefit a specific class than a dispassionate study of a system.  Not a unique view by any means:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajani_Kannepalli_Kanth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajani_Kannepalli_Kanth</a><p>Rajani Kanth&#x27;s major philosophical theories include:<p>a) that Ricardian Economics was merely policy advocacy in theoretical guise,[2][16][17][18][19][20]<p>b) that Economics is the crown jewel of the hegemonic ideology of Modernism,[2]<p>c) that European Modernism, whose derivates are capitalism and socialism, is the real grey eminence that has crafted the alienated misery of our epoch ...<p>John Kenneth Galbraith has some similarly damning comments:<p><i>Leading active member&#x27;s of today&#x27;s economics profession...have formed themselves into a kind of Politburo for correct economic thinking.  As a general rule --- as one might general expect from a gentleman&#x27;s club --- this has placed them on the wrong side of every important policy issue, and not just recently but for decades.  They predict disaster when none occurs.  They deny the possibility of events that then happen.... They oppose the most basic, decent and sensible reforms, while offering placebos instead.  They are always surprised when something untoward (like a recession) actually occurs.  And when finally they sense that some position cannot be sustained, they do not reexamine their ideas.  They do not consider the possibility of a flaw in logic or theory.  Rather, they simply change the subject.  N one loses face, in this club, for having been wrong.  No one is dis-invited

In addition to the obvious violations of Federal law, state and local laws were probably violated as well. This is not a matter of &quot;failing to comply with regulations.&quot; This is a matter of operating a Distilled Spirits Plant without a license.<p>Regarding labels, all labels are subject to approval by the TTB. (Not ATF. TTB, or more fully, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, was split off from what is now ATFE, in the Homeland Security re-organization of 2003.)<p>Simply to submit a label for approval, you must have a Federal Basic Permit, along with various other federal approvals. Even if you&#x27;re simply a &quot;rectifier&quot; (someone who blends and bottles, with no distilling) you need state and local permits as well. Labels generally have to be registered on the state level as well. This varies by state, but usually involves submitting your COLA (TTB certificate of label approval) to the relevant state agency and paying a fee.<p>There are also standards of fill and alcohol content, although that&#x27;s kind of irrelevant, as the operation was illegal from the get-go.<p>As others note, the labels themselves probably weren&#x27;t compliant with applicable law, (CFR 27) although again, that&#x27;s also beside the point. For those curious, download the TTB&#x27;s &quot;Beverage Alcohol Manual, Volume 2, Distilled Spirits.&quot; It explains all the requirements. There&#x27;s a learning curve. Even if you follow all the rules, your label may get sent back for revisions. I have yet to get one through on the first try.<p>Even if you give spirits away, some states have laws regarding advance notification of the state alcohol authority. You might also need to have bartenders with &quot;responsible vendor&quot; certification pouring the drinks. Of course, you have to be licensed to submit this notification, although some jurisdictions allow for unlicensed parties to obtain &quot;special event&quot; permits.<p>In summary, OP most likely broke a bunch of laws. On the bright side, they will probably get away with it, as the TTB is overworked and probably won&#x27;t bother with something this penny-ante. A more likely danger is the state alcohol agency.<p>My advice? Don&#x27;t pull this kind of stunt again.

The rest 2 were politicians (one of which was very high ranking).

Perhaps there are many more pages dealing with bombs than recipes though. Let&#x27;s find out.<p>&quot;pressure cooker recipes&quot; reports &quot;About 6,360,000 results&quot;.<p>&quot;pressure cooker bomb&quot; reports &quot;About 1,720,000 results&quot;.<p>Thus Google believes there are six times as many pages dealing with pressure cooker recipes as there are pages dealing with pressure cooker bombs. Therefore, given that they state that both content and search activity are used to form the autocomplete ranking, searching for &quot;pressure cooker bomb&quot; is a fairly common and unremarkable activity. This is not surprising given that it has been in the news a lot this last year.<p>Should then searching for common things that many people search for and which are relevant to recent news be considered evidence that one is engaging in terrorist activity and should be investigated and their house search? I would say, no, that is not reasonable.",1375401833

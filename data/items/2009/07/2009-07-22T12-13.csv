We also have an iguana (yeah, our house is a zoo...) and the iguana had to get some eye medicine at one point. I was holding my son nearby when my wife was trying to catch the iguana (because at this point it had caught on to the whole medicine thing and it did not like it). This also elicited a cry from him, as if he even managed to sense fear or anger in the reptile. In that case, though, it's also possible he was just responding to the iguana thrashing his tail and trying to run away inside his enclosure. The sights or sounds may have just scared him that day or even the actions of my wife trying to catch the iguana, or something - it's hard to say for certain.<p>As to why... I can't really ask him - he's not big on word use yet. :) I would guess, to some extent, that there's an instinctual desire to stay alive and that hostility can be a risk to that. Anger or fear could result in the people or animals around you doing something dangerous. It could also be a trust thing whereas anger represents a possibility that he can no longer trust your motives, maybe? I don't know - just guessing. :) It isn't just anger or fear that gets responses, of course. Happiness gets a big response, too, from a huge grin to joyful giggling to bouncing and other things that are like a direct visual indication of a burst of endorphins.<p>I did just think of a dog parallel, though. When he cries out of fear when the dogs are playing too rough with each other or the cat, it's a bit like how dogs will correct one another in a pack. If you've ever observed dogs in groups greater than 1, they have this interesting dynamic where they will keep each other in line. One dog may get too excited and another will perhaps bark or nip at them to get them to settle down. Crying out of fear could be a similar response in the sense that it's all the baby can really do to inform the ""pack"" nearby that they need to calm down, please.",1248267590

Just last week in one of those GPL vs. BSD threads someone posted a link to a story about how the author of CLISP was more or less coerced into using the GPL license. In any case, through coercion or not, releasing Linux drivers under the GPL is probably the right thing to do. Many users are strongly against loading proprietary binary blobs into their kernel. Still, not all vendors open source drivers so that ones that do could potentially enjoy a competitive advantage.",1248266524

717753,comment,717436,717729,0,0,10ren,,,"I misread that as ""just release the product"", which is the iterative development that perturbs Dijkstra. I think it can work really well for hill-climbing problems, where you have the right basic idea, and just need to keep tweaking it. But then you get enmeshed in those initial assumptions, like vines dragging you down... and you can never leave that hill.<p>However, you wrote ""just release the problem"" (as a contrast to ""thinking hard""). I agree that straining over a problem often doesn't help. I think that the kind of elegant solutions Dijkstra admires are more likely to come once you've absorbed the problem, and be receptive to solutions from your unconscious. Henri Poincaré <i>It is by logic we prove, it is by intuition that we invent</i><p>But I don't recall Dijkstra ever speak of intuition. Maybe for him, straining did work? One thing I've found is that straining to create a better representation (simpler, only the key things) does seem to help. It's fairly straightforward, but hard work. It helps because I can then <i>see</i> the problem - and my intuition can come into play.",1248266252

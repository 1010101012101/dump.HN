3925201,comment,3924609,3925104,7,0,wpietri,,,"I'd disagree on a couple of points.<p>First, engineers very often build crappy products when left to their own devices. The ones that they do the best at are ones where they are also the users and are more or less representative of the target audience. Google's a great example, and so is Firefox. So I think Google execs' perspective as a user was much more important. Consider as contrast Google Plus, which definitely was not built because was an avid but dissatisfied Facebook and Twitter user.<p>I think your second point is almost right. You should never try to <i>control</i> things you don't understand. It's ok to <i>manage</i> things you don't understand, because good management in that case is not directing the people who understand, but supporting them in achieving common goals.<p>As a non-tech example, few hospital administrators can perform brain surgery.

The approach I take, which seems to work reasonably well, especially for someone who is not a sales guy, is to start with a few templates for common projects. These include examples of how I think the project might go, which encourages me to ask questions to make sure I can fill in the particulars for that client. Then, TAKE DETAILED NOTES when you talk to the prospect. Things that seem vivid during the discussion may be hazy the next day, week, or month when you sit down to write the proposal. Then you can take those notes, and plug them into your template, and you have as close to the best of the both worlds (convenience and efficiency of a template, effectiveness of targeting the customer very specifically).",1336071186

The amount you pay them in theory depends on your earnings[1] but in practice how much you pay <i>right now</i> is linked to how much you earned <i>2 years ago</i>: They assume your profits will go up 8% each year, so for the current year, you pay ((profits 2 years ago * 1.08) * social security rate) + (difference to what you underpaid 2 years ago).<p>So if your income is unusually high one year, you pay social security as if you earned the usual amount, which means your profit is artificially high, and thus you pay a lot of tax. Then, 2 years later, you have to pay the difference of what you should have paid in the year you earned lots. Conversely, if you're having a bad year for whatever reason, you have to pay the same amount you usually would, even though you're earning very little. So the worst situation is if you earn a lot and then 2 years later earn very little: you pay lots of tax in the ""good"" year and get stuffed for social security in the bad year.<p>This is exactly my situation right now: in 2010 I decided I'd need some runway for our startup so I took on lots and lots of contract work. In 2011 and 2012 I've mostly been working on the startup, so I'm only doing maintenance work for existing contract customers. <i>All</i> of my contract revenue this year has been going straight into the SVA. The SVA bill is more than the rest of my cost of living put together.<p>And yes, back in 2010 I did try to increase my SVA payments because I knew this would happen, but they wouldn't let me.<p>Of course employees simply do not have this problem: even if their income fluctuates like crazy (seasonal workers etc.), every month they pay a percentage of the exact amount they earned. Yet self employed people are the ones whose income is most likely to fluctuate.<p>[1] 7.5% for health insurance, ~17.5% for pension, ~1% other - so this is quite a lot of money, and unlike tax there's no free earning threshold. In fact, it's the opposite: if you earn below around 550 p.m., you owe as much as if you earned 550.",1336070165

I had assumed that, for n founders, this would mean roughly (100/n)% of the company, minus a few percent allocated to Alice for bringing the team together and for her connections to investors. Alice has a good track record.<p>Some time passed, and eventually Alice gave me her actual offer, 5% of the company. At this point, there were seven people involved. When I asked how much was being offered to the others, and how much Alice wanted to reserve for herself, she declined to answer. I think of 5% as ""founding team"" equity, not ""founder"" equity, and it is considerably less than I expected.<p>I am mainly interested in the issue of open disclosure of the company's shareholders. Alice is handling the legal work of company formation. Based on my research and skimming of Delaware's corporate law (http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc07/index.shtml), it does not seem that Delaware C Corporations are under obligation to disclose who owns how much stock, only how much stock was issued at what par value.<p>How does everyone handle this with non-public companies?

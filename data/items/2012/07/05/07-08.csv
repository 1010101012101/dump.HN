4202149,comment,4199772,4201385,2,0,grey-area,,,"<i>Go ahead and try explaining a rebase without trying to broach the concepts of time travel.</i><p>A project can be described in terms of the changes users make over time, and that lets us undo any previous changes all the way back to the beginning of the project.<p>I don't think that explanation is overly technical or difficult to understand, and the generic features of version control which you dismiss are precisely those that make it most useful - the above paragraph in my opinion encapsulates most of what is useful about a VCS. To extend the above to cover a rebase:<p>A rebase is just merging other people's changes with yours, so that you end up with a merged version of the files, but with details that mean it looks slightly cleaner in histories - it's not even something many people will ever have to do. As to why having a local copy is useful, who cares, it's a detail of how the VC works?<p>This really is not rocket science - while git can at times be frustrating if you hit a particular problem which it doesn't consider important like expunging files from history, the basics are very very simple. You really only need 3 commands for day to day use:<p><pre><code>  git pull (get other people's changes)\n  git push (send your changes to others)\n  git commit (commit a change to your local copy)\n</code></pre>\nActually for commit I just add all new non-ignored files (using an alias like this: ""git add --all .;git commit -a -m"") to save typing, otherwise I might have to use git add as well now and then, so I use commit ""My message here"". If the above commands are scary, there are various alternatives to VCS, but they're not as good - you can rename your files when you make a change, you can use something like Apple's Time Machine, etc. All of those work, but are not really as easy as VC when you're changing a lot of files.",1341474628

Being forced to manually deal with headers and include directives in 2012 makes me sad.

In languages like Python or C# you can use explicit argument labels if you really need them instead of all the time.<p>Collections are going to be less painful with the new literals and autoboxing but they're still really crude compared to C++ stl, for example.<p>Most of what you can accomplish with KVO and notifications can be done with more explicit listener/delegate arrangements and that kind of code is a lot easier to understand too.

4202099,comment,4201654,4201912,0,0,zoul,,,"I think that Objective-C is pretty sweet.<p>The problem is that you can’t cherry-pick language features. Each of them has implications for the rest of the language, forcing you into some compromise. As an example, when Objective-C picked great compatibility with C, it picked some great strengths (using existing C libraries, language familiarity, being close to the metal) along with some downsides. For me, the Objective-C strengths are worth the downsides.<p>Some of your points are purely subjective. I would pick Objective-C verbosity again, because it makes me think less. I can generally parse long words at a glance and code completion saves me typing. Some identifiers are too long indeed, but the consistency is a win. For me.<p>I don’t see what’s so awkward about collection classes and you don’t say what is that you miss. Granted, the collection literals are too verbose, but that will get much better with the upcoming Xcode release, just as you said. And even the older, verbose syntax is not a language deal-breaker for me.<p>KVO and notifications are not always roses, but can you give an example of what bugs you along with a solution in a different language that you consider superior?<p>Again, my main point is that each language design is a compromise and I quite like the compromise represented by Objective-C. Namely, the simplicity of the language, the balance between the metal and a higher-level language, the readable syntax and the standard libraries.",1341473226

438017,comment,437852,438007,0,0,Maktab,,,"It was intended a constructive addition to the debate; whether it's constructive or destructive to this particular article's premise is neither here nor there.<p>And I disagree with your interpretation of my post as a monologue, obviously. A monologue implies a one-sided stream of writing or speech to which any other views are given little to no opportunity to respond. Many blogs are an example of this sort of thing. But this is HN: There's no restriction or limitation on anybody writing a response to my post that's equal in status, relevance and visibility. That makes it a dialogue.<p>To be honest, I also have reservations about these kinds of stories appearing on HN, but since this one's already here and still active I wanted to enhance the dialogue by providing more information about the legal background surrounding WP's use. If you're unhappy with the submission then flag it as unsuitable, but don't try suppress actual discussion on the subject if it gets underway.",1232193366
438016,comment,437824,437824,0,0,markessien,,,"ZumoDrive is not going to change anything. There was an app exectly like this back in 2001 or so. Back then, it did not work because the connections were too slow and space was not cheap enough - at the moment, it will not work for those same reasons.<p>There is no doubt that there are a lot of people who will use this - but it's not yet ready for mainstream. It's much easier to store you stuff on an external hard drive than on Zumo, and till it becomes easier, this will not really hit.<p>The startup will be profitable very quickly, they will gain hundreds of thousands of users, but ZumoDrive does not represent any big change in computing... for now.",1232193329

438010,comment,437824,437918,0,0,swombat,,,"If they wanted to be really clever, they could also analyze the data when it's uploaded and encode it in a less redundant way... for instance, it's quite likely that large numbers of people will have very similar mp3 files... if you could figure out that 99% of a certain file is exactly identical to 99% of another file, why store that data twice?<p>But, that gets very complicated... you're just shifting the hard drive costs into developer and cpu costs... so it may not be economical.",1232192746

5807230,comment,5806151,5806151,11,0,guylhem,,,"Disclamer - I don't really ""enjoy"" food, and I would happily live on soylent green if it was available - to get done with it and save time. I don't know how my personal experience may apply - a large university hospital is not the army. But after reading the article, it reminds me so many things.<p>Common meals, especially when you work in a high pressure environmenss, do create something special - something even above ""team spirit"", a kind of zen moment that provides a  unity of purpose.<p>I remember when 10 years ago I worked as a medical resident in the ICU, and the SAMU (french helimed, basically, if you are really badly damaged, we fly a physician, a paramed and a nurse in a chopper, to right where you are).<p>It was physically quite demanding: when the times are slow, residents for example had to check the expiration dates, reload doses of the drugs that had been put to use in the kits, test the batteries of the various devices, etc. Boring.<p>But when you hear a beep, or when your team name is called, you go. You run to the chopper, or to the ICU if they are low on personel and have to give you other assignements.<p>Anytime in between the beep/run/equipment maintainance, you try to sleep and eat - anyway you can. Back when I did it, it was either in 8h cycles (in one sane departement) or in 24h cycles (everywhere else- a law was voted, but didn't help a lot. too bad)<p>Anyway, one of the ""advantages"" of working in 8h rotations or doing a straight 24h was that we also had access to food, 24/7 - made daily by a cook around 11am-1pm and conditioned in small portions, but also industrial food of various kind (things you stuff your pocket with if you worry about fainting when your blood glucose sinks too low, but that you'll do your best <i>NOT TO EAT</i>.)<p>When we were lucky and could get a meal at 1pm, you could just ask the cook what he could do for you, depending on what he had, and he usually made it, in minutes - that's magic when all your thoughts are one something else.<p>I still remember - you've got fish today? Put some butter over it, fry it, then add me french fries on the side! Then 2 minutes the food come, it's good, and I start taking about the patient issues with a senior who also ordered specials: eggs, upside down, and a raw steak.<p>The stuff made by the cook, regardless of what it was, was simply better because it provided an emotional connection too. Even when it was conditioned in small portions for when the cook had to leave, it had been prepared by a team member we knew and truste to make the better with what was available.<p>There's no way to express that.<p>How you feel : you are tired, it's 1 or 2 am, you are hungry, you know you still have to work 6 more hours, and you are angry because of something - anything. The nurse misread something. A patient died. A test you expected wasn't ready - anything bad. You are concerned.<p>Then half the team go and share a meal in the break room, and it's like another world. The hassle goes away. You think about what you will do differently, thanks to the inspiration provided by these few minutes of comfort. And the guys or girls you had problems with, or even entered in a shouting match with - well, at that magic time of the day, everything is laid flat, and everyone understand and forgives. That's where the so called ""team player spirit"" grows.<p>The chef is not there, but his food made that happen. I still have my opinions about food, but a place with a 24/7 on site chef, that I could place a high value on.",1370145283

5807220,comment,5805921,5807076,8,0,jlgreco,,,"Supercriticality refers to exponential growth in the rate of fission (each fission event in turn causing more than one additional fission event), but unless other conditions are met then going supercritical does not mean you actually get a nuclear bomb style explosion.<p>There is also the concept of prompt and delayed neutrons.  Prompt neutrons are products of the fission of the fuel, while delayed neutrons are products of other fission products and are released shortly after the fission of fuel.<p>Normally nuclear reactors run prompt-subcritical, delayed critical (meaning that each fission event causes on average less than one other fission event with prompt neutrons, but when you account for delayed neutrons then the average becomes one for one.  The lag incurred by relying on delayed neutrons to push you up to critical allows the system to be controlled).<p>During both the SL-1 accident and the second Demon Core accident, for a very brief moment fission events were causing more than one additional fission events with prompt neutron products.  In other words they both went prompt-critical, which <i>is</i> a type of supercritical.  Thankfully SL-1 disassembled itself, the Demon Core rapidly heated and expanded, and neither were brought into a supercritical configuration quickly enough.  This is the fundamental difference between what happened when the demon core went supercritical when Louis Slotin fucked up and when it went supercritical when the they detonated the bomb made with it over the Pacific.<p><i>""one of the design problems to overcome in constructing a bomb is to contract the fissile materials and achieve prompt criticality before the chain reaction has a chance to force the core to expand. A good bomb design must therefore win the race to a dense, prompt critical core before a less-powerful chain reaction (known as a fizzle) disassembles the core without allowing a significant amount of fuel to fission.

But they are likely to change when consumer demand changes, which could happen if, for example, people receiving basic income start to upgrade their lifestyle away from abject poverty.<p>Some prices may actually drop as a result; for example, if more people can afford health insurance and get preventative care, the economies of scale for health insurance coverage improve. On the other hand, luxury goods with limited supply are likely to be pushed upwards to remain out of reach of the masses.",1370144849

On the other hand, when you're interviewing for a job, you could be one of 20 or more prospectives.<p>- I have been rejected in interviews for the most arbitrary of things. I was once rejected because I didn't know what __call__() did in Python, and because I didn't know about Partial objects in the functools library (part of the Python standard library). These are things that I was able to look up in < 5 minutes after the interview. This to me comes across as, ""I don't know how to interview people, so I'm just going to ask a bunch of obscure 'gotchas' and hire the people that get them right."" No one in their right mind is going to go into that level of detail when talking to a freelancer.<p>- ""Having a Github account,"" seems like a requirement these days, but I don't think that anyone at any company I have interviewed with has <i>actually</i> looked at the code that I have written beyond maybe counting the number of repos and the types of projects. This seems like <i>exactly</i> the kind of thing that people would want to do to hire a freelancer, look at their body of work.<p>- It's presumably more difficult (more hoops, more paper work, more laws to run afoul of, etc) when terminating an employee, vs. terminating a contract with a freelancer. So there's less of an idea that you need to make extra sure that you're getting the right person.<p>- Freelancing is more of a B2B transaction than a job interview is.

At this point in your life do you have the time to go back and get a CS degree? Or learn enough online that you can build a portfolio? If you can get a junior position early, then you can learn and get paid at the same time which is the optimal situation, but if you cannot do that, you will need to invest significant time and energy learning. Can you find the time to do that at this point in your life?<p>As others have said, I think if you don't get a CS degree, you really need to focus on results. Anyone can give programming a shot these days, but only some will ever be able to ship decent software and get paid to do it. Software development is ideally a meritocratic endeavor, so if you can develop the skills, age shouldn't hold you back. What would hold you back is not having enough time, motivation, or aptitude to develop the skills needed to get a job. Even if you can't get a job though, programming is a useful life skill, so I personally think it's worth a shot if you can find the time.",1370142034

5807122,comment,5806132,5806710,3,0,unimpressive,,,">The economic concept of centrally-coordinated production has nothing to do with 3D printing (?) or ""centralized"" / ""decentralized"" in the computing or distributed systems sense.<p>It has everything to do with economic planning (the Argentinian government at one point literally had a room where they president and staff would sit in command chairs and plan out production across the economy, although I don't think it was ever used).<p>Great, that's cleared up. It was ambiguous to me whether you meant in the systems sense or the one you've outlined here.<p>>Sure, socialism was designed to let the employees capture value. But intellectual freedom is different from who gets to capture the value. Even in America today, there are employee-owned companies. If capturing the value is what you care most about, you don't need socialism - just work for an employee-owned company.<p>I think that this is where the authoritarianism of most far left and right movements comes from. (Like Communism in the Soviet sense or Fascism in the Italian sense.)<p>In a free market economy, the score is kept with money. This necessarily means that everything which makes you make less money is bad. So you have an incentive to use less resources when making a product, and thus creates incentives for certain kinds of R&D. Consumers will obviously pay the same for better, so you also want to have the best product in your price range. Which is your incentive to keep improving your product. Both of these effects will improve products and make them cheaper.<p>It also means that when a finite resource is considered a public commons or otherwise not given its ""proper market value"", that it will be ruthlessly used up by money maximizing organizations. It also means that a profitable practice that produces some negative social ill will not be factored into the free market optimization process.<p>Generally, these are called externalized costs. And one of the Big Problems (TM) of the 21st century will be figuring out how to deal with them. Global warming is largely an externalized cost, to the extent that it exists. (I can't give a knowledgeable opinion on that topic one way or the other.) Another externalized cost is worker happiness, a money maximizer that can get more money by driving its workers harder will. And in a free market economy it will also prevail against more ethical organizations. This means that you have a few options:<p>Find a model where working workers less is beneficial to money maximizing.<p>Find a model where you can simply <i>force</i> money maximizers to be more ethical.<p>(At least, those are the two I can think of.)<p>Without commenting on the possibility of the first, which of the two seems <i>easier</i>? To me at least, it seems much easier for Vladimir Lenin or Benito Mussolini to decree that factories dumping waste into rivers will stop and start sending the waste to a designated disposal facility, on pain of death or imprisonment. Or in the context of a representative democracy, face huge fines.<p>This is why those ideologies which speak of a bourgeois (Before becoming a Fascist, Benito Mussolini was a Socialist, and took inspiration from left ideologies.[0]) usually employ the most authoritarian states. They exist by the following reasoning.<p>A dictatorship of the proletariat exists to counter act the free market forces which cause the exploitation of the proletariat in the first place. Therefore it must have control of the economy. Of course, an organization that controls the economy controls everything.<p>""Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws."" - Attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild, but I don't have a reliable source.<p>Moreover, the ""exploitation of the proletariat"" is a <i>moral</i> issue. If the state is allowed to dictate on this moral issue, then surely it can dictate on all of them. (Partly a constitution in the American sense exists so as to say ""You can't dictate on these moral issues."". One of the consequences of this is that some of the most thorny political problems involve changes to the constitution.)<p>As Paul Graham points out in 'Inequality and Risk', a lot of innovation comes out of people trying to make money. And if you're not on top of the innovation heap you may as well be on the bottom.<p>""Ok, so we get slower growth. Is that so bad? Well, one reason it's bad in practice is that other countries might not agree to slow down with us. If you're content to develop new technologies at a slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is that you don't invent anything at all. Anything you might discover has already been invented elsewhere. And the only thing you can offer in return is raw materials and cheap labor. Once you sink that low, other countries can do whatever they like with you: install puppet governments, siphon off your best workers, use your women as prostitutes, dump their toxic waste on your territory-- all the things we do to poor countries now. The only defense is to isolate yourself, as communist countries did in the twentieth century. But the problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce it.""\n - Paul Graham, 'Inequality and Risk'<p>Free market forces aren't a result of any conscious design, they're what you get when you predicate your society on making money. (Which, assuming that in your country making money is correlated positively with making wealth, countries that have free markets will probably have a decent amount of wealth.) To counter act free market forces you must either instill a near universal belief in an ideology which gets people to act against them, or have so much power that you can stop them from arising. \nUsually both.<p>The problem is that even if you can wield enough power to suspend the free market over a large geographic area, unless you control the world you'll have serious trouble competing in the free market forces on the nation state scale. Which leads to this quote by Mussolini which I currently use as my Litmus test for Fascism, which itself is something of a meta-ideology in its attitude.<p>""From the fact that all ideologies are of equal value, that all ideologies are mere fictions, the modern relativist infers that everybody has the right to create for himself his own ideology and to attempt to enforce it with all the energy of which he is capable.""\n[1]<p>So for Authoritarian regimes on the left or right, the only option to enforce their ideology is world domination. By force or by revolution.\n Again, usually both.<p>[0]:<p>“Therefore I became the public crier of this basic, partisan, warlike conception. The time had come to shake the souls of men and firet their minds to thinking and acting. It was not long before I was proclaimed the mouthpiece of the intransigent revolutionary socialist faction. I was only twenty-nine years old when at Reggio Emilia at the Congress in 1912, two years before the world war began, I was nominated as director of the Avanti. It was the only daily of the socialist cause and was published in Milan.” - Mussolini, <i>My Autobiography</i><p>[1]: One of the ironies of this idea is that in a world where it was universally employed, Mussolini himself would not be able to have done what he did.",1370142020

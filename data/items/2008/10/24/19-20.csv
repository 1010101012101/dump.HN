But I keep my 88 year old grandmother company often and she doesn't shut up, relating extensive biographies of the family tree going way back.  If anything it sounds like major career changes were more common in the past.  You definitely get that impression reading about colonial America circa the revolution.<p>I think maybe there was a brief post-war period where it was true?

(That's why people had paperweights). They were also more slender and indented than the sheer glass slabs that the ""less is more"" crowd have forced on us.<p>Traditionalists like Ernest Flagg and Sanford White were building for natural ventilation and energy conservation because there was no alternative. And they managed to solve this problem with soul-soaring art that was funtional and profitable.<p>Thom Mayne is attempting to invent something that had already been perfected generations ago but discarded in the name of ""progress.""

We got our first actual computer with a modem, a Macintosh Performa 635CD. 2400 baud dialup modem.<p>The first time I connected to an online service was fun. My cousin was over and we had pooled our money($20) to buy the Internet Phone Book. Thick book filled with several thousand websites. It came with a CD that offered dialup access to a company in Portland. Obviously my mom had a problem with long distance fees, so we ditched that before we started.<p>I had no software to actually do a connection, but my computer came with Clarisworks. Clarisworks actually had a COM program built into it. I got the number for the Tallahassee freenet from my local library. After a lot of trial and error we were able to type in the right modem commands (ADTD... etc) and it dialed up. Woot, we were ""online""!<p>Pretty quickly we figured out about local BBS's. Spent most of 94 and into 95 on those. By this time had upgraded to an actual telnet client. One of the BBS's also offered dialup PPP access. Finally got that working in late 94 and was on the Internet itself finally. My cd from the Internet Phone Book had a copy of Mosaic 1.0, so I installed that. Then we loaded our first webpage. Forget what it was, but it took forevvvvver to load.<p>Spent a lot of time over the next couple years on BBS's, then MUDs, and a LOT of time on IRC. As I upgraded modems over the next couple years access got a bit faster. GlobalVillage modems FTW! My first exposure to firmware was when my 28.8k GV modem was upgradable to 33.6 via a software update.

I learned much more about how to program by doing things myself from scratch than using the relevant libraries.  Also, I find learning the low-level stuff much more interesting that memorizing libraries and reading documentation.",1224875313

I could send an XML Warning, Error, or Fatal Error, for instance.<p>I'd settle for an email client with proper filters on either device, though..<p>The second point is search- The iPhone doesn't allow me to search through prior emails, which is ironic given the publicity of spotlight on the desktop. With my BB, I can search by day, sender, subject, etc; This is a necessity when trying to understand the context on a discussion.<p>Third- The BB email is much, much faster. Because it has real push email, I can get messages before they appear on my desktop- This is crucial for alerts. There is no good way to do this on the iPhone, without forwarding all my mail through Yahoo.  Zimbra on the server side, connecting to a BES server is a cheap and reliable solution.<p>So far, I haven't been impressed with ANY terminal applications- The iPhone's screen is too small, and too much space is taken up by the virtual keyboard on these, and the BB doesn't include any useful keys, like pipe or backtick on the default screen. Normally, I use the phones to receive information, and then fire up my laptop + Aircard to fix it.",1224875307

These days the equation has changed: companies are liable to dump you when quarterly profits aren't good, and you're likely to dump a company at the first whiff of something better.  That's better in some ways, but I think we've also given up something that may be harder to quantify.  For instance, if you're a happy worker and not worried about the next quarter, you can also invest in the company long term, rather than strictly looking out for your own interests, and vice versa, even if there's a bad quarter.  Said companies also had time to invest in things like creating Unix, and lots of other R&D that wasn't immediately registered as profitable.<p>I don't know that I'd be happy like that, and I think that the cream of the crop in today's world oughtn't look to other people's companies as a place to make their mark; still, I think it's something that bears thinking about.  Perhaps the pendulum will swing back at some point in the future.",1224874879

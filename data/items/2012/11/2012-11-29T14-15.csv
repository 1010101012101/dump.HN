The car bodies must fit production sedan templates, so the the chassis is welded tubular steel instead of carbon monocoque like on F1 or Indycar. The engines are carbureted instead of fuel injected.

If you are planning to run linux, seriously re-consider buying laptops with hybrid graphics. The graphic card might or might not run, the card switching will most likely not work, but you can ignore it since you can work with the intel card, right? Well, no. Most of the AGP, whether used or not, will eat up power, the fan will run at full speed and your laptop's behind will be hot enough to stir fry some veggies.<p>If you have a laptop with hybrid graphics, and you can't make it work, just switch off your discrete card.<p><a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics</a><p>Laptops in general, and linux laptops tend to run hot. However, don't mess with power settings a lot. Putting harddisks on powersaving mode(refer hdparm) so that they become idle puts unnecessary strain on the disk. You can try out experimenting with cpu frequency(cpufreq-set).",1354200996

But honestly I just don't trust Ubuntu after they built advertising ('online scope results') into their interface. How much more will they cripple their distro as they struggle to monetize? I understand Ubuntu is free, but this fact doesn't benefit the end-consumer much because Microsoft gives Windows to OEMs for practically free and the cost of OSX is irrelevant.<p>Most people who should be using Linux know how to install it on a wintel machine.

The pricing is confusing. :-)<p>A Dell MD1220 with 24 Crucial M4 512GB SSDs will run you $12,600. That's 12TB. Multiply by 4, enable compression, etc etc.<p>You could buy two of those setups, pay for power, cabinet space, and bandwidth, have a ridiculous amount of IO available, with single-digit millisecond latency, pushing 6Gbps and still have money to burn. And it'll take you (much) less time to unbox and setup than it will to push that much data up to AWS.<p>Granted, this new service is probably only 50% more expensive than hosted your own, and if you have zero IT staff, it might make sense in some scenarios, but it's definitely not a no-brainer.<p>It doesn't need to compete with Terradata.

4847964,comment,4847010,4847010,3,0,tom_b,,,"The proposed ""inner ring/outer ring"" admissions solution is interesting.  The inner ring of admission slots (say 20%) are filled purely on academic merit metrics (NMS, GPA, SAT score, etc), then 80% of slots are filled based on dumping everybody else who meets some much lower cut-off on those academic merits into a lottery for the remaining admissions slots.<p>I'm not entirely sure the author appreciates the likelihood of various strange outcomes using a purely random lottery for admissions, for example ""outlier"" admissions classes that heavily over-represent one racial/gender group by chance.<p>Another rather damning point of the article is that university admission officers may be spectactularly unqualified to actually make admissions decisions.  But I have been privy to the admissions decision process at the graduate level and bucketing applicants into the ""will succeed"" and ""will not succeed"" and ""who knows"" bucket usually winds up with a rather sizable number in the ""who knows"" bucket.  So maybe the critque on the admission officers should be less worrisome than presented.  I think PG has made statements that one of the biggest problems with YC applicants is that there just isn't an easy way to look at many applicants and make any reasonable determination about whether or not they could create successful startups.<p>Anyway, this is an excellently thought-provoking article and thanks for bringing it here.",1354200878

The immersive experience in first person shooters would benefit tremendously from that separation.<p>I suppose it's a good idea to let game developers experiment with the various control schemes, just as they did early on with defaults key mappings.

I have no problem with them as a business, but this touches on one of the things that's been getting to me about ""social"" (and I will bring this around to education) over the past few years.<p>There's an inherent exploit/explore tradeoff in ""social"". Or, more to the point, are you going to <i>document</i> social relationships or <i>improve</i> them (in spite of the fact that there are powerful people who don't want improvements to occur)? There's a lot more money and less risk in the former, but I'm more a fan of the latter, because that's where the great companies come from. Which is why I like Meetup a lot (with its unusual focus on <i>growing</i> the social graph) and feel more tepid about LinkedIn.

In that sense telomeres might protect against loss of function (cancers). I did not know they prevented non-homologous end joining, but see how they could.  I take it non-homologous end joining could lead to gain of function (cancers).<p>So what is the divide?

First a cell is converted into a cancerous state, perhaps even due to a lack of telomeres and subsequent loss or gain of function.  Then telomerase somehow is upregulated.

Cucumbertown now has users from devs to CEOs who came in through HN and are now engaged users.<p>Cucumbertown has some notions like 'forking recipes'  called Write a variation which enables you to take a recipe and fork and make changes. Additionally Cucumbertown has a short hand notation way to write recipes(think stenography for recipes)  for advanced users. Things like these appeal to the HN crowd a lot.<p>Also, dont you think quite a few hackers like me are also cooks!",1354199563
4847833,comment,4847665,4847665,2,0,jsaxton86,,,"This post mortem has me thinking about the best way to handle the situation in which you can't SSH into your server. The OP decided to trigger a kernel panic/restart on OOM errors, but I have a couple of concerns about this approach:<p>* If memory serves correctly, if your system runs out of memory, shouldn't the scheduler kill processes that are using too much memory? If this is the case, the system should recover from the OOM error and no restart should be needed.<p>* OOM errors aren't the only way to get a system into a state where you cannot SSH into a system. It would be great to have a more general solution.<p>* Even if you do restart, unless you had some kind of performance monitoring enabled, the system is no longer in the high-memory state so it will take a bit of digging to determine the root cause. If OOM errors are logged to syslog or something, I guess this isn't a big deal.<p>I suppose the best fail-safe solution is to ensure you always have one of the following:<p>* physical access to the system<p>* a way to access the console indirectly (something like VSphere comes to mind)<p>* Services like linode allow you to restart your system remotely, which would have been useful in this scenario",1354199512

He writes, ""memory works far better when you learn networks of facts rather than facts in isolation. If you dont really understand what differentiation is all about, then the fact that the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2 is a completely different fact from the fact that the derivative of e^x is e^x. But if youve derived them both from first principles (Ill come back to what I said about e^x in a moment), then they are related: we have a process we do to the functions  and  and this is what comes out."" This is a really good example of mathematician with a deep understanding of mathematics listening carefully to a student to understand how the student thinks, the better to explain mathematics to a struggling learner. ""Of course, another reason is that if you forget something, you have a chance of rederiving it, but thats a slightly different point. Your knowledge of a piece of maths is far more grounded if you know how it is derived, or at least have some memory of the derivation, even if you have no problem remembering the fact in question. Even if you forget the details of the derivations, just having seen them has a major effect on binding together the facts you know."" Hear. Hear.<p>P.S.

There may exist some trade off between the level abstraction and number of users for languages. You may have to 'hang around' long enough before the penny drops and you're a proper Lisper that can use the language productively. What other languages have for them, in my small experience at least, is that you can grasp all the essentials and get a general feel for the language very early on- allowing you to 'hit the ground running'. With Lisp, it takes a while (I started learning a few months ago) to grasp concepts such as macros, closures, and continuations, which really give Lisp its power, and then effectively implement them on the fly.

Ones that are in known locations that the system can use to scale the signal strength readings. That might help to combat some of the issues I mentioned above.",1354197762

2649496,comment,2649222,2649222,6,0,teilo,,,"This makes me wonder how many people ponied up the $99/yr. just to have access to the beta. Actual developers should know better. I wish Apple could figure out some way to prevent this - but if they were to prohibit reviews from people running a beta, they would also prevent legitimate reviews at the same time.<p>I also think there's a place for non-developers to be running the beta -- if they are responsible citizens.
I'm a dev, but not much of one yet. I'm on the beta, and I have discovered plenty of broken apps. When I discover issues, I communicate them directly to the app's developer. As a result I have also ended up beta-testing a number of apps for said developers. This is just as legitimate a use of beta-testing as developers testing their own apps.",1307980778

In reality, however, the US gets a ton of flak for supporting Israel, despite some of their questionable practices. Most of Israel's antagonists effectively equate Israel to the US. Is such a sentiment unfounded? Not entirely, considering that our politicians bend over backwards for Israel.<p>I respect Israel, and I see the value in a healthy relationship with it. However, the US should be looking out for the best interests of Israel, which are _not_ the continued oppression of the Palestinian people. Many Israelis understand that a two-state solution is the only sustainable solution...unfortunately, Netanyahu does not realize that. The US needs to push Israel in the right direction, for the sake of our shared relationship (and Israel itself).",1307980604

Doesn't the complaint that iCloud services are not accessible from any computer rest on the assumption that people are frequently accessing their data from different computers? What are the reasons someone would do this? I could think of a time a few years ago when, say, I was at a friend's house, sans laptop, and needed to check my email, so I logged into Gmail, etc, but I have my smartphone now. The email <i>is</i> with me on the go. Where is the data to support the claim that consumers use web services frequently on anywhere other than their own computers? I'd like to see that.<p>And I think Apple had a study sample in MobileMe that showed that even <i>with</i> web front ends to the 3 arguably most important on-the-go services: contacts, calendar, and email, that customers <i>rejected</i> (or didn't need) the web app because they owned smartphones! What's more, this is a biased sample, the customers who found the service so compelling that they paid $99 a year for it. It was very likely that the data showed that the web apps were by and large ignored.<p>Apple's iCloud represents a bet that the rest of the Internet services--Google, Flikr, Facebook, can take the other side on, and we'll still be able to use those services on Apple products.",1307980573

Here's the text you can copy and paste (make sure you mention it's a dupe of 9598285).<p><i></i>*<p>Title: Users leave bad reviews for app that don't work on beta OS releases<p>Summary:<p>The point of the prereleases is to give developers time to modify their apps to address any compatibility issues (as well as add new features) before the public release of the operating system. Despite Apple's best intentions at keeping OS betas limited to developers, the fact of the matter remains that average users can and do get their hands on prerelease software. This leads many non-savvy users running applications not meant for the new release and often leave negative reviews on the App Store because the app is incompatible with the new OS.<p>For example, see this blog post: <a href=""http://mbarclay.net/?p=1317"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mbarclay.net/?p=1317</a><p>One potential solution to this is to disallow app reviews for users running unreleased OSes. Another is to tighten up the developer program so that each subsequent beta release allows more and more devices to receive installs. With the current 100 devices per account right off the bat, there is widespread abuse of access to prerelease software.",1307980506

They have a long and storied record of opposing any and all potentially competing public infrastructure, to the point of e.g. suing to prevent municipal broadband initiatives in communities that they have refused (at least, until the time of the initiative, and sometimes even thereafter) to service themselves.<p>Whatever your political position, it's clear that the current Republican administration in Wisconsin favors private infrastructure and infrastructure maintenance over public.  This is playing out in numerous, diverse sectors.<p>What's unfortunate, from a technological perspective, is that this fairly apparently provides less service at significantly higher costs, and it delays upgrades by years.<p>In Illinois, getting DSL service from SBC/AT&T was a painful, frustrating experience -- when you could get it at all -- until the cable companies, particularly Comcast (I'm not expressing love of them, here, either) began large scale deployments that significantly ate into SBC/AT&T's customer base.<p>Based on my experience and layman's perspective, my interpretation is that this is about patronage and not technical nor financial innovation.<p>Reading between the lines, it might also be an attempt on AT&T's part to block a potential Google high speed deployment in Wisconsin.  Madison in particular has been suggested by some as possibly a prime location for such a deployment.<p>And the same Republican administration has been pushing initiatives that would aid in severing relationships in the current, statewide network of public higher education institutions.  (Generally regarded as functioning quite well and offering the population coordinated diversity of opportunities.)  The described changes would also dovetail with these efforts.<p>P.S.

Items like Twilight may I suspect stay around as they're 'a collectible series' in spite of perceived literary merit, almost as posters or similar do today.<p>I've compared the future of the book here before to the future of the horse in the early days of cars. They will retain a luxury and a prestige with enthusiasts for certain specific applications, but their previous general usage will likely vanish.<p>What will remain in print? Some may want classic texts like Don Knuth's TAOCP, though personally for that sort of thing I'd always rather have an eBook. I foresee primarily luxury 'coffee table' books - lavishly illustrated, beautifully made, designed to be objects of desire in themselves, independent of their content.<p>Otherwise, we're talking legacy content. I have a 1980 copy of a huge, library reference quality world atlas that can be pried out of my cold dead hands thank you, and a few other similar volumes, but pretty much everything else would frankly serve me better as an ePub file on a home server that could get synched to my various devices.<p>As an aside - I would <i>LOVE</i> a historic online mapping service.

2649436,comment,2648850,2649178,14,0,jonnathanson,,,"Here's the problem: scarcity exists on the creative side of the entertainment business, but it's scarcity by way of cost-prohibitive access. What's scarce? Access to $20MM-a-movie actors and $8MM-a-movie directors. Access to $200MM productions. Access to creating the ""tentpole"" movies and shows that result. All of these things require outrageous amounts of capital, and they're all dependent on the ability to monetize the end result by many multiples of production and advertising costs by way of theatrical distribution, DVD sales, licensing and merchandizing, and various other derivatives of the original work.<p>At least one major revenue stream, DVD sales, is collapsing steadily. This leaves box office and derivatives and licensing. Derivatives have never been huge business, or at least not a sturdy enough pillar to bear the weight that DVD sales have borne. And licensing has always been mere icing on the cake, except in the case of titles perfectly suited to it (such as Star Wars).<p>As the downstream revenue sources dry up, so too will the big production dollars, and so to will the scarcity of access to ""Hollywood-quality"" creative. At least for most companies.<p>What's going to happen? One theory is that we're going to see some sort of price discrimination at the box office. Big tentpole movies cost more to make than do lower-budget romantic comedies, for example, and so tickets to Transformers XXIV will cost more than tickets to Generic Sandra Bullock / Jennifer Aniston RomCom. (Arguably this is already starting to happen, if you consider 3D to be a price discrimination mechanism. Whether by intent or by accident, it functions like one).<p>Another theory is that we're going to see a hollowing out of the middle tier of the film and TV businesses. You'll have giant studios making giant movies, and you'll have tiny indies making tiny movies. But there will be no middle ground, because it will no longer be profitable.<p>All of this assumes, of course, that production costs hold steady or increase. And so long as there are folks out there willing to pay $20MM for a single actor or $8MM for a director, they will. But the bottom might drop out of that market eventually, too. Or it might stratify dramatically as outlined in the previous paragraph.",1307979938

Answer: According to the Fair Labor Standards Act, tipped employees are individuals engaged in occupations in which they customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips. The employer may consider tips as part of wages, but the employer must pay at least $2.13 an hour in direct wages.
An employer may credit a portion of a tipped employee's tips against the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. An employer must pay at least $2.13 per hour. However, if an employee's tips combined with the employer's wage of $2.13 per hour do not equal the hourly minimum wage, the employer is required to make up the difference.
The employer who elects to use the tip credit provision must inform the employee in advance and must be able to show that the employee receives at least the applicable minimum wage (see above) when direct wages and the tip credit allowance are combined. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference. Also, employees must retain all of their tips, except to the extent that they participate in a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement.",1307979565

Personally I find tipping to be a nearly meaningless exercise (nearly because occasionally great service deserves a bit extra).  Because I live in a country where we are expected to tip, restaurant owners do (and are allowed to with lower minimum wages) expect to be able to underpay their staff and let them live off tips.<p>It is to the point where most chains have a tipping system where wait staff tip out to everyone, chefs, bussers, etc so everyone gets a chip at it.  If you undertip the wait staff can actually lose money.<p>I'm tired of being responsible for someone elses paycheck.  Most restaurant waitstaff are merely ok, not amazing and not deserving of something extra, nonetheless I feel obligated to pay 15%+ anyways because of the culture.<p>Worse than this there are many here who despite the tipping culture feel perfectly free to never tip or undertip, leaving the rest of us to make up the difference (how do you think we go from 10% being a normal tip to 15-20%?).<p>It's for this reason alone and because I know most Groupon users are brutal cheapskates I will probably never take a Groupon for a restaurant.  Though one persons advice to tip up front or at least let the waitstaff know you have no intention of only tipping on the remainder is valid and if you are going to get a groupon deal you'd do well to remember that.<p>What sucks about this whole anecdote is it means owners using Groupon are getting doubly screwed.  They are getting one-timer coupon clipper who don't care about the crap service since they are never coming back anyways, and they are getting potential first customers who are not going to come back now because of the bad service.  Even worse they will likely get negative word of mouth.<p>Of course there is a simple solution here, plan ahead and don't mistreat your staff by making them beg for tips.  Personally I have zero sympathy for restaurant owners since they themselves are the ones who maintain this bullshit tipping culture.",1307979111

And not the tasteless, this place is expensive so I have to be seen here type. I am very critical of food. I have a culinary degree and I have a refined pallet when it comes to food. I eat at hole in the wall joints as well as 5 star restaurants and the only thing I care about and judge a restaurant by is the quality of the food.<p>I am constantly depressed by the high ratings that establishments receive on sites like Yelp and Urban Spoon only to go in and find that they are average at best. I have been to places with 95% positive ratings on Urban Spoon and walked away very disappointed in the quality of the food. I have seen fast food restaurants like KFC and Taco Bell with 9x% ratings on Urban Spoon. Meanwhile I have went to places with a 60% to 70% rating and the food has been out of this world.<p>When those sites where small, unknown and mainly frequented by foodies, it seemed like the quality of the ratings where much better, now they are little guarantee of quality. Now days, I really only use them to tell me what is around and to weed out the really bad joints. If a place is below 50% positive review I avoid it above it and it is a crap shoot.<p>The problem is people go out for dining experiences for a variety of reasons and they rate a restaurant for all those varieties. Being a foodie, I could care less about anything but the taste of the food. If it has the explosion of flavor I am looking for, I don't care if I am eating it on a paper plate in a plastic chair. Ambiance has no value to me where others it does. The demeanor of the wait staff has no value to me (other than the amount they will be tipped) where others it does.<p>They really need multiple flags on these sites so that people can rate the different aspects accordingly (I have not been on Yelp in a log time, so forgive me if this has been done). For me the only flag that counts is quality of food the rest of the weight being put into the positive and negative rating is just noise for me. While others may value something totally different and want to see the ratings weighted based on that.<p>These sites are a great start, but they have a long way to go, before that can seat you at the table you want to be at, with any degree of accuracy. The only value I have found is that they prevent you from ending up in a place that is really really bad. Then again Taco Bell has 9x% rating in my town, so even that is not a guarantee.",1307978216

Bubble sort is not much easier to implement than selection sort either. It has no interesting properties which make it worth considering (unlike, for instance, insertion sort). The only possibility of one knowing bubble sort is by hearing about it on algorithms classes, and in that case one already know heapsort and quicksort, so that there is no need for bubble sort.

This isn't the customer's fault, of course, and I sympathize with the OP for crossing this restaurant off his list: Why return to a restaurant that doesn't work out how to make their staff happy about the promotion?<p>A bigger question is whether this is an isolated incident or something to expect when dealing with similar deals. From what I know about the way small restaurants are managed, I would expect this to happen on a fairly regular basis.<p>One possible solution: The fine print of the deal could levy a 15% gratuity on the face value. Customers who want the freedom to tip less should exercise the freedom to pay the face value of the food and beverages.

In hindsight neither the service not the ""special"" treatment you get as a Groupon customer warranted it.<p>Because of their attitude I won't be back, that's the cost for making an assumption about me as a customer. I'm still undecided whether I'll use Groupon again though. Maybe seeing this insight into this restaurant was a good thing?",1307977851

That location turned out to be overcrowded and the staff rude.<p>The other visits were pleasant or at least we had no complaints afterwards. We DID go back to some of the restaurants (even without coupons) and recommended some to friends. Some others aren't really nearby, so we might not visit them again, but I'd recommend them as well.<p>However, I first google for reviews of the restaurants/companies before buying a deal. I'd not buy a deal for a restaurant with no or only mediocre reviews. And I present my coupon before ordering - that would have saved you from the bad experience with the first bottle of wine.<p>Of course, it greatly depends on the restaurant. If they don't plan the Groupon project, they may get overrun shortly after the deal. And the tip problem is already mentioned - so staff isn't always glad about ""deals customers."" I've even heard discussions with ""deals customers"" on a neighbor table that insisted of getting money back because their bill was lower than the deal.<p>Worst I experienced was not with a restaurant but a deal for a walking tour. The company was totally overbooked, promised to provide more dates for tours, but never delivered. Even 6 weeks after the deal, customer service turned out to be great and refunded the deal promptly.<p>A friend of mine bought a deal from a small photo studio (90% discount) - and yet (about 5 months after the deal) waits for a confirmation for an appointment: ""We are fully booked until at least end of next month."" Hopefully, the studio will be still in business at the time he gets an appointment (or he gets a full refund).<p>Its not Groupon or Daily Deal to blame for bad experience, but the business owner. But due to the growing popularity of the deals, places are more likely to get crowded after a deal. And because Groupon and co think that ""the more, the better"", they approach businesses as well that don't deliver great service all the time or are just unable to handle the amount of deals sold.",1307977408

The contractor had no interest in doing so, and that's where I came in.<p>The code has been working well for all intents and purposes, and we have users (in the high 4 digits) who use the product everyday and love it, but it's showing limitations. Here's a quick overview (it's a Django webapp):<p>a) There are many inefficiencies in the code, and now that our userbase is starting to grow fast, it is causing major slowdowns. My current solution is to throw more dynos at it, which sort of works but is an ugly temporary workaround.<p>b) The code is more tightly coupled than not, which is making life tough when implementing new features. Many parts could be refactored.<p>c) There is no unit testing, which makes things harder than they should be when it comes to testing/hunting bugs.<p>d) Nothing is commented; and even though Python tends to be somewhat self-explanatory, it gets pretty dense when trying to understand what certain things do.<p>e) The architecture of it all is very monolithic; based on our plans for the future business development, quite a few parts should be decoupled and made more independent of each other.<p>A full rewrite seems out of the question, as we have many users and we need to keep on moving with bug fixing + shipping new features. For that same reason, it's hard for me to justify blocking 2 weeks to refactor a subpart of the application.<p>I'm the only engineer right now; we're funded and looking to hire more people, but it's going slowly.<p>Has anyone been in a similar situation before?

That was a different time.<p>I think, in general terms, it might be interesting to have access to data well outside of YC and similar tech incubators.  I wonder what it might look like if we included all manner of businesses, from gas stations to bakeries and, yes, tech?<p>In that case I would suspect that success or failure might correlate to factors other than the number of founders.<p>Now, this is going to sound weird because I will agree with you:  In tech the probability of success should increase with more founders (to a limit).<p>I'll qualify this by saying that it has to be the right founders.  They can't be clones.  They have to bring something different to the table.<p>In my opinion, the same could be achieved --to a point-- with a single founder and really good initial hires.<p>The reason I say this is that a tech startup, particularly today, might have to cover so many disciplines that it is nearly impossible to find all of this in one person.  And you probably wouldn't want to, even if you did find this person, at least not for the long haul.  So, a good founding team or a good single founder and a solid hired-in team is almost mandatory.<p>My own experience has been, well, maybe ""unique"" is the word.  While my training was in electrical engineering over the years I've had to learn a number of engineering disciplines on my own due to the various directions that life (and my own curiosity) led me through.  I became a mechanical engineer, software engineer, embedded engineer, learned FPGA's (they didn't exist when I went to school), learned metal and plastics manufacturing and even became a decent salesman.  All the while, when it was possible, I'd find people to replace me in certain functions.  Finding good people wasn't the easiest part of my job.<p>This is where finding good teams fresh out of school makes a lot of sense.  And this is probably why the success rate falls off quickly as you get farther away from places like Stanford.<p>We probably agree.<p>I think what touches people the wrong way might be that your data seems to be used to create bias against single-founder ventures and this has to some extent permeated the industry.<p>It is probably 100x harder to get funded as a single founder.  Perhaps single-founders have to settle for lower levels of funding, lower quality deals and less support (I am not talking about YC here, just a general statement) and, with lower funding comes a far greater probability of failure.<p>In my prior post I mentioned self-funding my first startup to the tune of $250K.  What I did not mention is that I was grossly under-funded and just did not know it at the time due to my lack of experience in the segment.  This was a hardware/software/manufacturing startup and $250K was nowhere near what I needed.  I probably needed two million to do it right.  I would end-up having to go and hustle for more money during the first year by consulting and doing projects just to be able to keep going.  I burned through that cash very quickly, almost before I left my garage.  And it was just me!  I never had enough money.  It was a real struggle.  At some level, the only reason I did not fail was because --cliche alarm-- failure was not really an option.<p>So, yes, I think that for the most part I am in agreement with your position.  I have the scars to prove just how tough it can be.  It probably would have been far smarter to go find outside money and build a team.  I just wasn't wired that way and, frankly, the option wasn't even on my radar.",1353256145

Of these, 16,434,000 indicated any type of income. Combined, these 16.4 million sole proprietorships reported a net income (less loss) of $265 billion.<p>- 3,146,000 returns were filed for partnerships. These returns showed a total of 19,300,000 partners. Of these, 1,609,000 returns indicated any type of income. Combined, the 1,609,000 partnerships reported a net income (less loss) of $458  billion.<p>Some numbers:<p>- 72.67% of sole proprietorships reported income.<p>- 51.14% of partnerships reported income.<p>- 22.614 million sole proprietorships generated $256b in net income (less loss). This is an average of $11,320.42 per proprietorship started.<p>- 3.146 million partnerships (covering 19.3 million people) generated $458 billion in net income (less loss). This is an average of $145,581.69 per partnership started. Or, this is a net income (less loss) of $23,730.57 per partner.<p>Using US census information on non incorporated businesses (in 2008) provides some interesting space for thought. A higher percentage of sole proprietorships report income, but on average partners in a non incorporated business report more income. This seems to indicate that it might be easier to get started if you go alone, but adding founders increases the magnitude of success (when it works out). Logically, this makes some sense, though I hesitate to make any conclusions based off of this data.<p>While this data is interesting, it is ultimately quite useless at answering the question. First off, this data is on all non incorporated businesses (other than farms). Therefore, this data may or may not be applicable to technology. The Deloitte report (and the writer's research) indicates that the top 100 technology companies have an average of 2.12  founders. The US census data gives an average of 1.62 founders per company. That difference could indicate differences in the two populations (ie - tech companies versus all companies) or sampling differences (Vibhu looks at 100 companies, I'm looking at data on 41 million).",1353255727

Are reviewers rating the data using the right scale/format?  1-10 might mean one thing to you and something different to someone else.  1-10 might be inappropriate when you really mean a multiple choice, 1 of N text descriptions.  Different types of inputs mean reviewers will <i>think about things</i> differently, and also mean you'll have to process your data differently to get an appropriate visualization.<p>2. What are browsers trying to get out of it?  Maybe those ratings, or their descriptions, are helpful in the general case.

You've got a lot of encoded assumptions and we're trained to break them down.<p>That said, to answer your question, even though it might be the wrong question, there's a great O'Reilly book called ""Information Dashboard Design"" which explains how to make data visualizations that are actually useful.<p>After you get through that, you might look for an old book called ""Using Charts & Graphs"" by Jan V. White.  It's out of print, so finding a copy might be hard, but it's the opposite of the Tufte books someone will invariably suggest, but which are inappropriate for you.  ""Using Charts & Graphs"" specifically talks about what we now call infographics: telling a story using a chart or a graph.<p>(Tufte's books are inappropriate here because they're textbooks for print people, and while they have lots of good information, implementing their takeaways in electronic form is left as an exercise to the reader.  It's way too much work for this situation.)<p>You might also try to dig up the work done by Summize back in 2007/2008, before they were acquired by Twitter.<p>Finally, if you'd like to talk more about this with an actual designer, you might be interested in a design ""office hours"" experiment I'm running, called UX Hours: <a href=""http://uxhours.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uxhours.com/</a>.  For comparison, this well-defined question, resulting in advice on things to consider and two places to find out what you need to do, is just about right for a 30 minute consult.",1353254699

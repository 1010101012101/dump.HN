They did have pedagogy classes (4 hrs/week, I think?) and 1 or 2 additional hours of psychology compared to other high school programs, but this was otherwise a regular high school and at the wonderful age of 18, you were a primary school teacher.<p>My mother later decided she also wants a degree in Psychology (she got back to school for her BSc and an MSc -- quite bravo for someone who was, at that point, in her forties), but she often tells me how much of what she learned was in the job, not in school. It helped that she had to put on several hundreds of hours of supervised teaching.<p>On the other hand, she reckons that she was doing it wrong in many aspects that did not have directly to with pedagogy. She has now come to realize that for long time -- her first ten, fifteen years on the job even! -- the way she handled a lot of aspects involved in working with kids outside the matter of teaching them this concept or that method were wrong.<p>Unfortunately, no amount of study can prepare you for that. Having a well-paid, secure job, a safe family life and a frustration-free existence is even more important. A lot of her colleagues (she doesn&#x27;t live in quite the most pleasant place of this world, albeit it&#x27;s in the better half) vent a lot of anger and misery on the kids they teach, wrecking generation after generation.

Ghostery seems to have redone their UI recently and it looks like one of those form-over-function redesigns that happen when a company comes into some money, decides to spend it on looking pretty but forgets to spend any of it on usability analysis.   Since it sounds like their revenue does not come from the users, making it look pretty but less useful doesn&#x27;t really hurt them as long as there are no competitors.<p>In case anyone cares, when I say less useful I mean that the new layout makes it harder to individually enable/disable specific trackers in the cases where a tracker provides functionality necessary for the website to operate.  The new layout is much more mouse intensive for anything but the trivial case of minimal trackers on a page.  It&#x27;s unwieldy to selectively enable trackers on sites with more than roughly 5 trackers on them because of the manual scolling-in-a-tiny-window layout and difficulty reading the list of trackers due to drawing lines through the text of their names.",1371540630

It relates to foreign entities, and only to counter-terrorism, anti-proliferation, cyberwarfare / hacking, and relates to phone numbers and emails etc. He said from this program, via a warrant to the likes of Yahoo (etc), they can obtain content.<p>10) Obama says that he has asked the intelligence community how much of these programs can be declassified without compromising their missions.

5897978,comment,5897452,5897452,60,0,weland,,,"Dear God, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m a kid again.<p>I didn&#x27;t grow up in the US; when I was a kid, we didn&#x27;t have this kind of interviews on TV. For one thing, most of the TV shows they aired was propaganda, and it was so utterly boring most of us didn&#x27;t bother. The newspapers, on the other hand, carried propaganda along with the news, so you kindda had to read it, too, if you were to know what&#x27;s happening. The smarter folks could even read between the lines.<p>This one struck the most sensible chord:<p>> And what that does is that does not apply to any U.S. person. Has to be a foreign entity.<p>Entities. Not individuals, not groups, but entities. If you&#x27;re an American citizen, you&#x27;re cool. If you&#x27;re a foreign entity, you&#x27;re preeeetty much either a ladybug or a human, either way, it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing.<p>This was Communist speak for non-Communist (to be fair, it was the twisted kind of Soviet-inspired Communism). We had communist workers and teachers and housewives, but foreign elements. Our country had communist friends but the democratic entities weren&#x27;t that friendly.<p>This defensive depersonalization makes it very easy to strip away ethics. Butchering unarmed civilians sounds a lot more horrifying than annihilating non-combatant, but dangerous entities.<p>> The  because  the  first of all, Charlie, the number of requests are surprisingly small number one. Number two, folks dont go with a query unless theyve got a pretty good suspicion.<p>This sounds very much like the kind of conversation that, at some point, was taking place between Soviet representatives and representatives of various other subordinated, but somewhat nasty countries of the Soviet block.<p>It&#x27;s the kind of stuff that was handed out to us during the talks about the Warszaw pact. Is it true that the Soviet Union has supreme command of all troops and can invade any territory, even that of its allies? Well, no, I mean, it wouldn&#x27;t be an invasion. It&#x27;s a trade-off we have do for our freedom: should the Revolution be abandoned in any of the member countries, the allied countries should intervene to restore the right values. That is why the Soviet Union has to have representatives at all levels, must be informed of every decision. It&#x27;s one of those things we must concede for democracy -- we need to entrust our freedom to people who can protect it. Words like freedom, democracy, values and way of life were freely thrown in -- ours was the land of the brave and free, unlike that of the oppressed working-class friends living in imperialist, totalitarian states.<p>I shivered a bit when I read this.<p>Edit: BTW, just to practice my reading-between-the-lines muscle, my guess is that a) FISA hasn&#x27;t turned down any request yet and b) the requests were summarily &quot;reviewed&quot; and approved, through a short process that should give legal backing. In other words, FISA isn&#x27;t there to actually review the requests, it&#x27;s there simply in order to fill in the paperwork that&#x27;s needed in order to make the whole thing seem legitimate.<p>In the early days of the regime, we had something similar to this, too. The curious dudes submitted a request to a committee of representatives of the people -- the request was basically a form which said that the following people have highly suspicious activities that can be a threat to the security of our people, to the Revolution and the communist way of life we have so hardly fought for (actual fucking words!) and was recommended to be placed under surveillance. These were signed pretty much in bulk -- the representatives of the people usually signed a big list at the bottom. Later on, this was eventually dropped: complaining about paperwork was useless, and after a few years it became obvious complaining about paperwork was so dangerous that when it was no longer required, no one dared do anything about it.",1371539236

5897963,comment,5897231,5897231,2,0,shawn-furyan,,,"In many ways, this is an inherently unanswerable question, and it&#x27;s just about as unanswerable for US citizens as well. At it&#x27;s root, the problem is that you&#x27;ve left information scattered around the internet, much of this information is possibly stored indefinitely in various US intelligence agency databases and that this information can be used to make inferences (correct or not) and judgments (fair or not) about you and your actions. It is also possible that information may be framed in a manner so as to give a misleading impression of you and your actions.<p>Being outside the US is both an advantage and disadvantage with regard to these programs. The advantage is that you are in a bigger pool that is likely less interconnected with those who have access to this data, and so are less likely to be targeted by abuse of the information that has been gathered around you. The disadvantage is that it appears that if you did end up being targeted, it seems less likely that such targeting would rouse suspicion since the privacy rights of non-US citizens do not seem to be getting any consideration from US officials at all.<p>The difficulty with these questions is that people try to think of scenarios by which information can be used against them. This isn&#x27;t really a productive exercise since failure to come up with a reasonable scenario in no way proves that one doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Perhaps a better question is &quot;Could anyone with access to this data ever want to hurt me, my relations or our respective reputations?&quot;. Implicit in the question is the assumption that anyone with said access is capable of hurting you or your reputation by releasing it strategically. Some may argue with this assumption, but I would challenge that few, if any of us really have a handle on just how much data we leave laying around on web servers outside of our control, and so are ill equipped to make judgements about how it might or might not be used against us. This question too is very difficult to answer with a reasonable level of certainty, but it at least leads us to some more productive questions that get at the breadth of the problem:<p>&quot;Do I, or any of my relations ever openly or privately (in channels controlled by US intelligence programs) make strong political statements?&quot;<p>&quot;Do I, or any of my relations play a visible role in any company or organization that someone with access to this data might find morally or politically disagreeable or inconvenient?&quot;<p>&quot;Have I, or any of my relations injured, spurned, rejected, humiliated, or otherwise hurt, physically or emotionally, anyone with access to this data?&quot;<p>&quot;Will there ever be a scenario where I, or any of my relations are put into direct or indirect competition with anyone with access to this data?&quot;<p>&quot;Could someone with access to this data ever want to randomly target me or my relations for kicks?&quot;<p>&quot;Could a malicious 3rd party ever gain broad access to this data and use it in a way that hurts me or my relations?&quot;<p>These questions get at just how broadly the effects of abuses of this data could reach. Will you be targeted for abuse? It&#x27;s extremely unlikely, there are 6 Billion people in the world, and there are certainly bounds on the amount of harassment that can be done secretly. But nobody is really immune from being effected by abuses of this kind of data. There are innumerable strong personal incentives for abusing data such as this, and the more of it that&#x27;s out there, and the more connected, organized and searchable it is, the more likely it is that abuses will happen.<p>[edited to improve formatting]",1371538842

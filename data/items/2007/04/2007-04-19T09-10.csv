Could the moral of the story be: don't hire in-house lawyers if you can, and make sure someone PR-competent holds a big stick over their heads if you do.",1176976746

It seems to me as if someone there has just hired some overly enthusiastic lawyers, and top management/PR department hasn't realized how much it's hurting the company just yet.<p>This doesn't take away from the engineers that seem to have done a great job implementing S3/EC2 before the competition has much of anything comprable to offer.",1176976285

2.u cannot start an idea that is a direct competitor to ur companies business<p>if these two do not apply u shud be ok, but the laws are harsher here in the uk. with non compete clauses etc

14540,comment,14464,14464,0,0,npk,,,"ced - ""Bayesian Theory"" is more than just a formula, it's a way of thinking.  A beautiful book exists on this subject, ""Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms"" by David Mackay, which you can read for free online.  Granted, the nomenclature is confusing, there is a Bayes formula. [Edit: jey mentioned Jaynes' book.  Another excellent reference.  Link to chapter in Mackay (<a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itprnn/ps/22.40.pdf"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itprnn/ps/22.40.pdf</a>   read from bottom of page 25 on)]<p>In regards to the unsophisticated aspect of startups, I think that much of the low-lying fruit has been picked.  Statistical sophistication is but one ladder to the higher fruits.  Why?  Social websites have enormous databases of information about their users.  People who /understand/ data will be able to take social networks to the next level.

You shouldn't stay too long (a year or so), but there's a lot of much worse paths you could take.<p>Don't spend too much effort on it though...the interview process can really suck up a lot of time (I know because my girlfriend works there), and if you aren't really Google material (don't have a proper degree in your area of interest, for example) your odds of getting hired are low...particularly given your inexperience.  I've received a recruitment letter from Google due to some projects of mine on the web, but I suspect I wouldn't actually get hired.  Luckily, I already know what I want to do in California, so I don't need to work at Google while I figure it out.  ;-)",1176974457
14538,comment,14464,14464,0,0,jey,,,"A very good essay on Bayesian probability theory and its applicability to rationality is ""A Technical Explanation of Technical Explanation"" at <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html"">http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html</a> . The beginning is more mathy than the latter half, which is more interesting, so don't let the math keep you from reading it and getting to the more interesting later parts. There isn't much math, and the math that is there is pretty simple. If you haven't been introduced to Bayesian probability, you need to at least skim through the article entitled ""An Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning"" that is linked to from the above URL.<p>If you decide that Bayesian rationality is totally awesome, read the book ""Probability Theory: The Logic of Science"" by E. T. Jaynes, which is specifically about Bayesian probability theory and its applications, derived entirely from a list of simple informal ""desiderata"" that we would expect from a theory of probability. He shows that Bayesian probability theory is the <i>only</i> way to satisfy these simple logical desiderata, and that Bayesian probability theory is the unique consistent and natural extension of Aristotolean logic (True/False logic) to real values.<p>Bayesian probability is a good topic to be familiar with as a general conceptual tool for evaluating information; it's not just some obscure theorem used by statisticians.",1176973979

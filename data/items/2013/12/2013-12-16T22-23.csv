6918429,comment,6917429,6917429,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>The termination right, of course, is a limit on free transfer. As a result, instead of a narrow attack on the termination rights of musicians by reclassifying their works as “works-for-hire,” the text here could eliminate termination rights for everyone.</i><p>But is this bad? Yes, there&#x27;s definitely a power imbalance, but if the copyright regime is simpler, with no artificial legal limitations on the lifetime of the contractual assignment, then artists can negotiate either higher prices or reversion options at time of assignment.<p>Speaking as an artist (with experience of starving, being ripped off by publishers, and sundry other disadvantages), simplicity has value. A 35-year termination rights period is a nice idea for a corrective but actually limits my negotiating position as the publisher is going to discount the value of the copyright assignment appropriately. The flip side of the economic imbalance between creator and publisher is that the publisher is in a much better position to realize the benefits of long-tail revenue, since publishers have expertise in marketing, analytics, revenue collection etc. that are difficult for an individual to acquire, and whose acquisition has a significant opportunity cost in terms of creative development/output. If the publisher can lose all contractual rights after 35 years then it has every economic incentive to a) maximize up-front economic gain and b) minimize long term commitment.<p>Also, as regards the TPP specifically, if this deal were to go through as-is then artists would be able to argue that overseas publication rights were worth more money due to the harmony of regulation, in stead of having revenue siphoned off my the bureaucracy of dealing with multiple differing copyright regimes in the signatory countries. In my view, a single licensing standard that extended from the EU (via upcoming TTIP negotiations) to much of the Pacific Rim (via TPP) would be a distinct plus for artists, since that would cover something like 70% of the global economy and would massively reduce transaction costs.",1387234657

It is a gypsy taxi service, and gypsy taxis have existed for as long as taxis have existed. Licensed taxi fares are uniform for very good reason: predictability and fairness.

Facebook provides &quot;social&quot; and there is no meaningful filter on quality. That&#x27;s not a knock on Facebook; that&#x27;s not its job. People can fill your feed with junk. Of your 400 &quot;friends&quot;, 390 are really acquaintances. I have the most respect for what Meetup is doing (&quot;use the Internet to get off the Internet&quot;) but the problem of providing a <i>quality</i> social experience over the Internet is an unsolved one. (Meetup just helps people plan offline experiences.) I think that it will start with multiplayer games. Board games are great at alleviating social awkwardness that forms when people are new to each other or haven&#x27;t kept in touch for a while. It goes beyond games, though; really, the problem is how to allow people to have meaningful and social experiences in such a way that they can be online, offline, or mixed (i.e. a game where some people are physically in the same place and some are not, or a game that persists as their locations change). Maybe we should try this out, do an Ambition tournament some time in 2014. Anyway, there are a lot of unknown variables-- especially around mobile devices-- but Quality Social is where the future (of social/consumer web) is coming from.",1387233825

Smith is based on what&#x27;s called third-party doctrine: basically that the Fourth Amendment applies to your stuff that&#x27;s in your possession. If you give your stuff to someone else, they don&#x27;t have a Fourth Amendment right to it, and the government can take it without a warrant. Before the digital age, it was unusual to entrust sensitive private information to third parties. Most of what we had was kept on paper. Now, people put huge amounts of information in the hands of third parties, often without really realizing it. Extending third-party doctrine to all digital information would decimate online privacy.<p>This is where the future of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is headed, and how the courts decide will have huge ramifications for the future of privacy.

We&#x27;ve all been there. Either as an individual, an agency, or a software company, we&#x27;ve been in a place, dependent on a relatively lower-profile project where we&#x27;d cheerfully tip in the $50-$300 range. That&#x27;s probably good for everyone. There are a few ways of doing this, but what you&#x27;ve described -- &#x27;tip for this specific commit&#x27; -- is how easy we all wish it was. I wish it was a feature of github.<p>But their model is good, too.<p>Some open-source projects are relied upon by thousands, tens of thousands, or more people, and they want to know that everything, small and large, is being done to keep the software stable. As others have commented in this thread, this would be a way to pump up the ecosystem for popular, highly-depended-upon open-source software projects.<p>Sure, adding features like this might induce gaming. But if I understand their model, this may just mean that those reviewing pull requests may just need to take an additional factor into account -- whether or not the commits involved are substantive, or if they&#x27;re too &#x27;gamed&#x27;. It seems like it might be a self-licking ice cream cone, because larger-scale gaming (attempts to earn Real Money through mostly-frivolous PRs) could be caught by review, whereas minor cleanups for docs or comments in the commits of a PR that includes more substantive work might be, as other commenters have mentioned, perhaps just a few percentage points of &#x27;wastage&#x27;.<p>I don&#x27;t think we really know if it&#x27;s feasible or not, but I applaud these efforts tremendously.<p>I also wonder if a hybrid system could work -- perhaps as a feature to be added to the &#x27;tip for all commits&#x27; approach.

Right now the dominant narrative on HN seems to be &quot;the government has expanded their powers to intrude on our right to privacy.&quot; Rayiner is suggesting that perhaps the government is simply exercising the power it had been granted over years of precedent-setting court decisions (including, critically, the loss of expectation of privacy when information is handed to a third party). According to this alternate narrative, what has changed hasn&#x27;t really been the government&#x27;s scope of power, but rather our increasing reliance on third-party services to mediate our interactions in the modern world. As more and more of our communication is digitized and aggregated by third party services, more of our information falls within the government&#x27;s constitutionally limited scope.<p>A key point of contention is whether what we&#x27;re seeing here is the government breaking laws, or the government following laws that simply haven&#x27;t caught up with the times. Rayiner believes (I think) that it&#x27;s the latter, and therefore has reason for optimism; as he says, &quot;I think those laws [to protect electronic communications] could work because I don&#x27;t believe the government is just ignoring the law.&quot;",1387232273

So in 1976 Congress chose to double down on termination, making it explicitly an inalienable right that cannot be sold by any type of contract.<p>It strikes me as a rather tortured reading of this that makes it a limitation of the artists&#x27; rights, rather than the publishers&#x27;; like laws which outlaw contractual slavery, while it technically bans both parties from participating, the intended impact is much more on the would-be oppressor than the oppressed.<p>Now, the impact that this might have on open source is certainly interesting, but I doubt it would have far-reaching implications since termination wouldn&#x27;t retroactively affect licenses that were in force at the time, so derivative works would be in the clear.

Well two in one post, actually.<p>1) Capital gains income is often first passed through a corporation, thus getting taxed at the insanely high US corp tax rate before getting taxed a second time at the moderately normal US cap gains rate. So US citizens are still paying more on average, even if it all doesn&#x27;t show up as such on a tax return.<p>2) And Mitt&#x27;s specifically! Let&#x27;s count the misconceptions (note that I don&#x27;t blame you - the media never described them and let the infamous &quot;14.1%&quot; figure stand because it&#x27;s a good story):<p>a) Doesn&#x27;t include state tax rate. That right there could easily tack on another 9%. Though it could also be zero if in Texas. Mitt of course lived in Mass, so it&#x27;s just 4% or so.<p>b) No one deducted charitable contributions. As a Mormon, that was 10% of his income. So add another 1.4% to his tax rate there.<p>c) People counted his off-shore income, which is counted as income but not taxed until repatriated, as taxed at 0%. In fact it would be taxed at normal capital gains, which today is ~20% Federal + 4% Mass. Depending on the blend of foreign to domestic income, this could amount to a lot or just a little. Let&#x27;s say his offshore income constituted 10% of overall income, for a ~1-2% higher average tax rate overall?<p>d) Most impactfully, no one&#x27;s counting the Corp Tax rate which was paid before he took the Cap Gains. That&#x27;s 39% Federal and another 8% Mass (~46% total), assuming that it&#x27;s coming from Mass based corps. I&#x27;d say a solid chunk of his income is coming from this sort of income, probably in the ballpark of 70%, but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s 30% (of his income subject to this sort of double tax) to be super conservative.<p>Starting with base <i></i>14.1% + 4%(a) + 1.4%(b) + 1-2%(c) + (.3)(46%)<i></i> = <i></i>21.5%<i></i> just with very simple adjustments, and as high as <i></i>31.4%<i></i> with a corp tax rate blended in a bit.",1387232108

It also most closely resembles the odds of the original game show (win by switching (n-1) of n times, or 2 of 3 with 3 doors). Anything else becomes a different game (you don&#x27;t have a <i>single</i> choice, you have a multitude of choices). And it doesn&#x27;t turn it into a <i>different</i> problem, it exagerates the odds of the original problem to better illustrate the statistics to people whose intuition is wrong. The case of 100 doors where switching results in winning 99% of the time gets passed the questioners intuition that it should be even odds (switching or staying).<p>(a) demonstrates that the questioners intuition about the probabilities is off, but (again, IMO) doesn&#x27;t really offer the clarity of (c).<p>Re: Summary - I agree, it&#x27;s not an accident. It was chosen because it was a good number for a game show, and leaving the participant with 2 options (switch or stay) ensures a certain swiftness of decision. While (a) (say they used 4 or 5 doors) offers only a <i>slight</i> improvement on the odds (contestants may lose too often) and (c) (again with 4 or 5 doors) offers a perhaps too great improvement of the odds (contestants win too much if they know the trick).",1387231953

A group of workers who do not have the freedom to engage in competitive tender, because they are forced to address their fundamental needs, are in a much worse bargaining position irrespective of whether or not they have &quot;skills to offer to society&quot;.<p>The wider point is that structure matters: an organisation that is run dictatorially by a small central group is, by my estimation, fundamentally more illiberal than an organisation that is run cooperatively by its members.

Eventually it will receive another message with a longer chain and be forced to abandon its own work and adopt the new longer chain.

6918133,comment,6917194,6918044,4,0,rayiner,,,"> However, my question was along the lines of political theory, not constitutional law.<p>There is an important <i>practical</i> reason for drawing the distinctions and putting things into correct legal perspective: if you believe that the government has slowly chipped away at legal rights that used to exist, then it&#x27;s harder to justify believing that political action can change the status quo. On the other hand, if you recognize that what you really have is a disconnect between peoples&#x27; behaviors as enabled by new communications technologies, and the government&#x27;s acting pursuant to established law, then it&#x27;s much more justifiable to believe that political action can change the status quo.<p>As for whether the government should collect less or people should be more wary of broadcasting their private information, my answer is: both. I think laws are necessary to create protections for electronic communications that didn&#x27;t exist before (and I think those laws could work because I don&#x27;t believe the government is just ignoring the law). At the same time, I find it a little bit disingenuous for people to complain about being tracked when they carry little tracking devices around with them.<p>Ultimately, what you&#x27;ll see is a shift in equilibrium of privacy. I don&#x27;t think you can structure the law to hamstring the government so much that it doesn&#x27;t know anything more about you than it did in 1975. Not in an era when people broadcast their bowel movements in real time to their thousand closest Facebook friends so that companies can spam them with advertisements for the best laxatives. Socially, we&#x27;re in a post-privacy era in that regard. Though I do think you&#x27;ll see the equilibrium fall at a point short of &quot;the government collects everything, all the time.&quot;",1387231208

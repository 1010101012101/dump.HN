Of course, they also can employ anticompetitive measures to ensure that all other services are worse on iOS so I guess it sort of evens out.  Google has some similar issues but I think they have a much broader interest in making their service universal than Apple does.

Much of the content on those sites doesn't even work on both Gecko and WebKit at the same time, never mind IE. Meanwhile, real sites still have to cope with a majority of visitors who don't have the latest shiny new features.<p>In any case, a lot of those features frankly aren't all that beneficial anyway compared to basic things like not freezing the entire browser UI because one tab is taking a while to load.

Kindle can only have a monopoly because DRM represents a huge barrier to entry.

Doesn't mean they are not useful for certain (hacky) things. Google Dart is a direct response of the V8 team against JS having (among many other things) these kind of constructs. If you want your JS to keep getting faster, try not frustrating the guys that make your crap code faster by advertising these constructs too much. Thank you.",1335308528

With Google's Closure Compiler, all your useless statements about 'thou shalt not use' are redundant.<p>If people want to save bytes, they will do it naturally. Everyone has their own coding style. Enforcing 'your way' on others is just patronizing, and shows how little regard you have for others carefully crafted workflow. Sure, avoiding the Wrath of Crockford is fine, and I demand every developer adheres to his always useful comments on the language.<p>But don't try and be him, by offering very little in depth advice on what 'not to do' in JS. The only people that avoid semicolon use are the ones writing JS1K demos, and actually care about bytes. The rest - they do it to save costs on their high-speed CDN setups they have on their blog.<p>My point is, there is no need to be religious when we already have a dozen or so packer scripts, and byte-saving scripts, on the web already (JSCrush, Dean Edward's Packer Tool, @cowboy's packify etc.)<p>Not to mention the already mentioned, and very powerful Closure Compiler. And I could go on, and I urge others to suggest other packers out there at the moment in this discussion.<p>When I'm hit by a bus, and my code is only understandable by me, then sure, by all means, attack me, and mark my code as obsolete, unusable, and redundant, but at least look through the foot-notes and see I made a developer-friendly version of my code, completely un-minified, obfuscation free, and free of gotchas and unorthodox methods.<p>Peace.<p><a href=""http://higg.in/s/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://higg.in/s/</a>",1335308449

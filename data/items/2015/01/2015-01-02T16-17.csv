* They don&#x27;t know yet that their approach will fail
* If you come to them with an already finished, they will realise it took you a very short time to build it: hence, they&#x27;ll consider your solution is worth less<p>I don&#x27;t think you can put a yearly cost of 15k$, if they already think 25k$ is too much. In their eyes, for the first 3 years (standard license duration in my field...), the TCO will be 45k$+hardware, which is even more unacceptable.<p>For the &quot;exclusive&quot; license, it all depends if your source code is actually re-usable by a third party...<p>What you can probably do is come up with a two-fold contract:
<i>15k$ for 100hrs at 150$/h
</i>If the software delivered can run on the low-end hardware, company will save $24k/year. Developper is then entitled to a yearly payment of 12k$ for the first 3 years....<p>It&#x27;s a win-win situation: if you fail, you still get the 15k$ and they still have a solution.

He came to rest in the fern a few feet away, face downward, green arrow-feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar. His scarlet robes were tattered, his corslet of overlapping brazen plates was rent and hewn, his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with blood. His brown hands still clutched the hilt of a broken sword.<p>> It was Sam&#x27;s first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face.

Other wise you need to change forever. Diets are temporary. If you are overweight, you need to change some of your habits around food and exercise forever.</i><p>Speaking as a high school wrestler...my last year I had to cut from 130 to 112...most of it was water weight though I tried to keep under 1,000 calories a day. After the season, I gained that weight back in about 3 days, and then an extra 10 pounds that I have never been able to lose (not that I&#x27;d want to be less than 130 pounds). Not contradicting the OP...just pointing out, even if you are a wrestler, season-long dieting sucks :)<p>Also, one mistake that I hear of from casual dieters/exercisers...getting excited about losing 1-2 pounds after their first day of a decent workout and light meal...and then getting depressed a couple of days later when that weight ticks back up. Over that short period of time, that weight is almost definitely just water weight...for wrestling, we obsessively weighed ourselves...and the number of pounds (of water) you could lose in a 2 hour workout was always impressive. Taking a short piss was almost a sure way of losing at least half a pound. And even if you stopped eating the day before weigh-ins, did a normal workout, and restricted your water usage...you could expect to be at least a pound lighter by weigh-ins early morning due to water loss through respiration during sleeping.",1420217388

In fact, age-adjusted cancer death rates have been steadily dropping in the United States[1] and in general death rates from cancer and from other major causes of death have been decreasing throughout the developed world throughout my lifetime.[2] What that means in practical terms is that life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world, so if you have reached the age of 50, you can be ever more confident of reaching the age of 65, and if you reach the age of 65, you can be ever more confident of reaching the age of 80, and so on.<p>It is possible for expanded cancer screening programs to produce the illusion that rates of age-adjusted cancer diagnosis have increased because of a real increase in cases of cancer,[3] but what is really going on with increased screening is increased detection of early cases of cancerous growths that eventually die off and never cause clinical disease. The human body has some defenses against cancer, and many cancers reach a growth dead-end not long after starting. Screening programs sometimes detect harmless cancers that don&#x27;t need any treatment except watchful waiting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/31/us-cancer-casualties-idUSKBN0K918220141231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/31/us-cancer-casualti...</a><p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/dataview/2014-04-17/how-americans-die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/dataview/2014-04-17/how-americans-d...</a><p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[2]

Access means the ability to read; control means the ability to delete.  Right now, if I upload content to almost any cloud provider I give access and control of my data to that provider: using G+ gives Google the ability to view every photo I upload, and to delete them all at a whim.<p>In a hypothetical cloud provider which enabled me to encrypt data locally, they would have no access to my data, but would still be able to delete it.<p>I would actually like the ability to grant control over a copy of my data without granting access to it; the two should be independent.<p>I&#x27;ve had a vague idea for some time of system which enabled me to store encrypted data and share the keys with my friends but not with the storage provider.

This is great progress. Publishing has never been private and doesn&#x27;t need to be. There&#x27;s a place in society for public tools and a place for private ones as well. The problem occurs when people try to use publishing platforms as private communication. Of course that causes problems. It&#x27;s a matter of using the wrong tool for the job.

I don&#x27;t care if something is big, slow, and messy if it solves my problem when nothing else can.<p>My experience is that when choosing an embedded scripting language, small and clean really are first-class features.<p>When you drop a scripting engine into your app, you&#x27;re going to end up spending some time debugging into that code. You&#x27;re basically on the hook for understanding and maintaining it. The cleaner and smaller that is, the simpler your life is.<p>> The only bullet point that comes close is the one talking about it being &#x27;class-based&#x27;, but I almost never hearing someone say &quot;moving the code to classes will solve this problem&quot;.<p>Syntax is a usability feature, not a utility one. It&#x27;s almost never a question of &quot;<i>Can</i> I do this?&quot;, instead it&#x27;s, &quot;Is it easy, enjoyable, and not error-prone to do this?&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re writing object-oriented code (which many people do in scripting languages these days), I think dedicated class syntax is a real usability win for most programs.<p>The FAQ has an example. Here&#x27;s Lua:<p><pre><code>    Account = {}
    Account.__index = Account

    function Account.create(balance)
       local acnt = {}             -- our new object
       setmetatable(acnt,Account)  -- make Account handle lookup
       acnt.balance = balance      -- initialize our object
       return acnt
    end

    function Account:withdraw(amount)
       self.balance = self.balance - amount
    end

    -- create and use an Account
    acc = Account.create(1000)
    acc:withdraw(100)
</code></pre>
And here&#x27;s the same thing in Wren:<p><pre><code>    class Account {
      new(balance) { _balance = balance }
      withdraw(amount) { _balance = _balance - amount }
    }

    // create and use an Account
    var acc = new Account(100)
    acc.withdraw(100)
</code></pre>
> What problems do users that need an embedded scripting language have? Just guessing, but probably #1 is the difficulty of integrating it into their existing project (and ease of extendibility with my app).<p>Yes, the usability of the embedding API is a key piece (and one I still have to do a lot of work on). The other big ones are performance, the usability of the language itself, and the comprehensibility of the implementation.<p>The language usability is a huge one because that&#x27;s one of the main reasons you&#x27;re even using a scripting language. If the language doesn&#x27;t make it more pleasant to express your intent, you may as well just stick with C.",1420214792

The address bar for the browser is actually very similar to the standard WP browser, which also doesn&#x27;t have the usual icon labels. Back, forward, refresh, stop, more, and share should be self-explanatory, so I guess you were having issues with the mobilize and open-in-IE icons? I might change those out for the reading mode icon that IE uses [1], and the IE icon, respectively, which should hopefully make them more obvious. The reason I did not use them in the first place is because I have not been able to find vector/font versions of those icons. Also, I agree with you on the WP app bar, it&#x27;s really well designed, however since it&#x27;s an OS component it can&#x27;t really be customized which is why I&#x27;m not using it.<p>4. The rotation angle is already bound to the horizontal scroll offset. As for the rotation direction, I tried both ways and this one felt better to me. I&#x27;m not sure why scrolling the bar in one direction should cause the rotation to feel wrong to you though, maybe try scrolling the bar by dragging instead of using the button and see if it still feels weird?<p>5. That&#x27;s a very good point that I never thought of. Fixed, and should be available along with some other minor design changes next week.<p>BTW, would you be interested in beta testing a Reddit client I&#x27;m currently working on? Your feedback has been the best I&#x27;ve gotten so far, much appreciated :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/03/04/introducing-reading-view-in-ie-11.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/03/04/introducing-re...</a>",1420214730

The societies with a lot of tech, eg the US, UK, EU etc are fairly free, the societies where you get killed for saying the wrong thing or having the wrong belief such as N Korea or the Islamic state are pretty low tech. I&#x27;m optimistic that computer tech will work against 1984 like systems of which I guess N Korea would be closest to in the real world.",1420214591

If you&#x27;re buying the car new you shouldn&#x27;t focus on the purchase price, but the value for your trade in and your APR.<p>Most used car sales generally only brought in $1,000-$3,000 in profit. The dishonesty in the business doesn&#x27;t revolve around the pricing, it&#x27;s in the details of the cars. Salesmen will lie about resale values, maintenance records, previous owners and so on.<p>My advice is to identify 2-3 cars you&#x27;d like and then buy that car with 30K-50K miles on it no more than 3-4 years old. You&#x27;ll still be able to get a low APR, and you&#x27;ll have cashed in on a car that will hold it&#x27;s resell value better than a brand new car.",1420214451

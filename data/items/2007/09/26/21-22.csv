I was saying Fortran was going to die soon and their only argument was ""see, you can do it in Fortran! you are just replacing one syntax with another!"". Actually damn Fortran died a bit later than I expected, but those're just technical details :)",1190842938

Embedded sucks but there are lots of techniques (abstraction) you can use to avoid them. Unavoidable is writing web based applications without using several languages.

60013,comment,59794,60009,0,0,dfranke,,,"1. Ok, that looks correct now.<p>2. There's a word for such a system.  It's called a database :-).<p>3/4. Ok, sounds good.  But like many others in this discussion, you're confounding SQL with the relational model.  Your pseudocode above goes slightly outside the relational model because it's written in imperative style, but can be adapted to it easily enough just by replacing your for loop with set-builder notation and maybe a unary union operator.  Sure, SQL has warts.  It was originally designed as a language extension for COBOL for chrissakes.  But the language you're inventing is just a prettier syntax for basically the same semantics.",1190842409

60010,comment,59837,59874,0,0,zach,,,"Indeed, I was panicked back in high school over the sudden need to suddenly pick a college major, specialty college and/or career.  I had just been focused on ""college prep"" up to that point.  I knew little about engineering, which is what everyone who I asked for advice pushed me towards, but I did end up going to an engineering school.  That's really not a good way to do it.<p>I endorse learning by specializing early and often.  You really can't beat serial specialization to give you a broad set of experiences, rather than a little about a lot or a lot about a little.<p>One of the most common improvements I see in our local schools is earlier specialization.  Here in LA, we have life sciences, math & [hard] science, and even marine biology high school programs.  For my part, I went to an arts elementary school (grades 5 & 6) to learn acting and still value that experience.<p>However, I notice that well-regarded private primary and secondary schools rarely specialize in that same way.  There's Julliard and Olin and even Deep Springs, but not so much before that, is there?  I don't think there is, but I'm not sure whether that's an issue of quality or simply parental demand.",1190842042

60006,comment,59794,59946,0,0,geebee,,,"I'm sure that databases need to evolve to some extent, but is the relational-ness really the problem?  When I start with a data model, I find that thinking in relations (and the various normal forms) is a very natural way to approach the problem.  I also like the way that sql and relational databases mirror (to some extent) relational algebra - of course, I haven't written relational algebra since school, but it's actually interesting, and shows a solid mathematical foundation to rdbms systems.<p>What I hate (and I get the feeling you hate it too) is object-relational mapping.  This is truly, exceptionally tedious stuff.  Hibernate was no fun, but I find Rails to be far, far less of a hassle.  <p>And there's plenty to object to in the various implementations of relational algebra (ie., the different RDBMs's).  But maybe the programming language side is exactly where the innovation should be occuring.  <p>  ",1190841574

60002,comment,59794,59993,0,0,dfranke,,,"1. Your solution is incorrect.  I said you need to be a member of all the groups associated with a forum, not one of them.  How would your code handle a public forum (one with no groups associated with it)?<p>2. Suppose you have one million users.  Then you're sucking up an awful lot of RAM just for this tiny piece of functionality.<p>3. Your pseudocode makes a lot of convenient assumptions about what functionality is already provided in standard libraries and in the accessor methods for user.groups and group.forums.  Let's see it written in a real language.<p>4. You say you don't care about how data is stored and accessed, but given the right set of reasonable assumptions, I can conclude that the running time of your algorithm is O(n^3).  The beauty of relational databases is that you usually really don't have to care.  The query optimizer is pretty good at figuring it out for you.<p>EDIT: nostrademons, I saw that peer reply before you deleted it.  That was just spookily similar :-)",1190840742

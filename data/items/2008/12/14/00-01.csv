The point remains, all the cows were sick, so Adams' analogy is appropriate.<p>The fact that everyone just ASSUMED that the cows were OK, because they usually weren't sick in the past, instead of just going out and looking at the cows, really doesn't help to make this whole situation less worthy of ridicule.  Everyone was saying things like you are saying to convince themselves ""no, no, it's more complicated than that, see we have all this math, you don't understand"" when the simple truth was that all the cows were sick and just looking at the cows instead of doing the fancy math would have made more sense.<p>Sometimes it is actually better to oversimplify things and just get the big picture and not get lost in all the details.  This is Adams' underlying point, and I think it is valid in this case.",1229216350

397107,comment,396935,397066,0,0,aristus,,,"Not at all, nor am I arguing Cisco's case. I think Cisco has stepped in a big cow pie.<p>However, I think FSF is taking a big risk as well. The original demands, pre-lawsuit, were already rather severe and in the case of notification, silly. No one goes to that much effort about a product recall unless it is catching fire or something.<p>I understand that FSF is trying to prove a point, and a valid one, but I also fear what will happen now that someone has finally called their bluff.",1229215406

Or any multithreading, actually, and I dislike Java-the-language with a vengeance.<p>These days I'm using Clojure, although I haven't yet used its STM in performance-critical situations. I'll have to see how that goes, but the functional programming model goes a long way to encourage doing it right: even if I did end up tossing out the STM and rolling my own atomic + lock-based system for an app that's limited by the STM's performance, it isolates the synchronisation issue logically.",1229214569

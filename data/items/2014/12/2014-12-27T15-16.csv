8802864,comment,8801011,8801011,0,0,GuiA,,,"I&#x27;ve been on a PKD kick recently, because I had read some of his short stories as a teenager and seen movies based on his work, and kept hearing how much of a genius he was. In the past month or so I&#x27;ve been going through his body of work, and my mind is getting blown at every turn. My goal is to read all that he&#x27;s ever written over 2015.<p>Here&#x27;s a rough progression I recommend for those who want to delve into one of the best writers who has ever lived (of course hardcore PKD fans might disagree with the following, and I&#x27;d be happy to debate with them :-):<p>STARTING POINT:<p>- Ubik, Flow My Tears the Policeman Said, The Man In The High Castle, A Scanner Darkly, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? - those are his most famous novels, self contained, and the most accessible. They&#x27;re fantastic, and a great entry point into PKD&#x27;s mind. Most of these are from the later years of his life, when he had developed a pretty consistent, high quality style. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with these, and if you don&#x27;t like them you probably shouldn&#x27;t bother with the rest of his work.<p>- Movies based on his work, notably Blade Runner (which he himself expressed appreciation for, although he never saw it fully), and A Scanner Darkly, the first Total Recall + the adaptation of Confessions of a Crap Artist. While they&#x27;re not strictly PKDian, they&#x27;re a good way to get immersed in his way of thinking as the directors did a pretty good job of conveying his themes. The more recent ones (Adjustment Bureau, Total Recall remake, Minority Report, etc.) are fun as well but uneven in quality - but they can be a completely fine introduction to his mind bending ideas, especially if you want to convince friends who aren&#x27;t into reading to try out his books.<p>INTERMEDIATE:<p>- Stuff from his mid-years: Galactic Pot Healer, Time Out Of Joint, Martian Time Slip, Confessions of a Crap Artist, The Crack In Space. Still very good stuff, but I think you need to be already well acquainted with PKD to fully appreciate them and see how his style and ideas were developing.<p>- The Valis Tri/Tetralogy (Valis/Divine Invasion/Radio Free Albemuth/The Transmigration of Timothy Archer). That&#x27;s where you start to get deep into PKD lore, and you should read about his life to get the context in which they were written.<p>- Most of the short stories from ~1960 and onwards. Some are great, some less so, but they&#x27;re short so you can easily get through the ones you like less.<p>FOR THE HARDCORE FAN ONLY:<p>- all the obscure short stories and remaining novels not mentioned above - they&#x27;re not necessarily harder to get into, but they&#x27;re from his earlier years and thus don&#x27;t have the same level of craftsmanship (a few are not even really sci-fi). Also he wrote so much stuff that you should only spend time with those dozens of works if you&#x27;re really, really into him.<p>- The Exegesis of PKD: a selection of about 10% of his personal notes, written towards the end of his life when he was completely {drugged out | schizophrenic | a religious nutjob} (pick one or more, or invent your own). It&#x27;s basically his interpretations of life, the universe, and everything else, based on (somewhat sound) insights from philosophy, physics, biology, etc. This is an insane book that you can only appreciate (and have the strength to go through) if you already have a solid understanding of his world views and ideas.<p>---<p>Someone recently wrote on reddit &quot;Nobody writes like Feynman; but luckily he wrote a lot.&quot;, which is a quote that I love and would apply equally well to PKD.",1419695769

This is a total red herring.<p>>It states extremely clearly that ...<p>It doesn&#x27;t say any of that. I think you must be citing the wrong section. (Or if not, it would be helpful if you&#x27;d quote the part which you think says any of this.) This is all somewhat irrelevant anyway, since even if the Swedes <i>could</i> question Assange while he was in the UK, it does not follow that they are obliged to do so. If they would rather question him in Sweden, and if they can legally obtain an EAW, they are perfectly within their rights to take this course of action. If I were a suspect in a crime, I would not expect to be able to dictate to the police the time, location and circumstances of my questioning.<p>>Again, you are factually wrong.<p>You said in your previous post that &quot;there was no examination of whether the description seemed reasonable&quot;. This is clearly not the case, as you can see by looking at the material under &quot;Issue 2&quot; in the High Court judgment. Assange&#x27;s lawyer claimed that certain material in the prosecution file showed that the description in the EAW was not &quot;fair and accurate&quot;. The court examined this material and concluded that the additional material did not in fact reveal any lack of fairness or accuracy. (They also pointed out that it would not in any case be proper for them to base their decision on conclusions derived from this material. That is a technical legal issue, so I really don&#x27;t know if they made the legally correct decision. However, it is largely irrelevant, since they saw nothing in the additional material which would have influenced their judgment.)<p>> There was no or only an extremely limited ability for Assange to face his accusers, challenge the evidence, or request supporting evidence from the Swedish prosecution.<p>None of that would make any sense in the context of an extradition hearing. Those are all things that are properly to be done in the Swedish courts. It&#x27;s not the business of the English courts to second-guess the results of an eventual trial in Sweden or to attempt to decide the facts of the case. The facts of the case are to be decided in Sweden where the charges were made. This is all, needless to say, clearly explained in the High Court decision.<p>>And yet you somehow managed to conclude that (1) there is evidence supporting any of these claims, and (2) Assange would be convicted of rape on the strength of that evidence.<p>I didn&#x27;t say (2) or anything close to it. You are playing very fast and loose with what I write.<p>>So let me close by saying that you should be ashamed of having defended such an irregular abuse of the legal system, and doubly-so for now arguing with a straight face that anything legal is by definition moral. As Nietzshe would have commented, the problem with this approach is that it makes a mockery of law itself.<p>You&#x27;re clearly very angry with me for some reason and I think it&#x27;s leading to a lack of care in what you&#x27;re writing here. Of course I have not argued that anything legal is moral. Rather, I&#x27;ve argued that it is morally right that Assange should face the charges against him. The claim that this is an irregular abuse of the legal system is a bit far-fetched when you consider all of the failed appeals. Most of your arguments against extradition were not actually made by Assange&#x27;s lawyer (most likely because they have no actual legal merit). The arguments that <i>were</i> put forward by Assange&#x27;s lawyer are quite obviously rather tenuous -- and somewhat tasteless in their trivialization of non-consensual sex -- and it does not take a conspiracy theory to explain why they were rejected by the English courts.",1419694731

8802809,comment,8800727,8801675,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"You simply need time in the field experience with these entities and the managers within them. It is pretty likely you were dealing with mid-level managers at best. VP titles in F500 companies are handed out like candy; most F500 VPs don&#x27;t have signing authority for more than a few K per month, at most. A good sales person in the situations you described would have worked in qualifying questions into those conversations. How many people reporting to you would also benefit from this solution? Can you work this into your budget now or shall I work with you on justifying it into the next budget cycle? And so on.<p>The primary reason you didn&#x27;t hear anything back is because these people, if they had any signing authority at all, are used to sales people pushing the deal along, and being the passive partners of the deal, no matter how enthused they were at the beginning. It is normal to see lots of initial excitement, followed by silence to repeated daily/weekly calls/voicemails/emails/letters/gimmicks for weeks/months/year, then a mad rush to purchase in just a week or two. I would go into details of why it generally works this way, but it would make an already too-long reply execrable.<p>Your description of what you were pitching was too vague for me to tell for sure, but the general rule of dealing with those licensing agreements is to get a company counsel to talk with you and express what their concern is that prompts such an agreement/clause, then in a friendly manner suggest alternate wording that protects that specific interest while not infringing upon your interests. Generally speaking, once you are exchanging legal/purchasing/contracts paper, F500 folks cop less &quot;my way or the highway&quot; attitude, and are more willing to meet you halfway if you are reasonable and negotiate friendly-like. Hire an attorney to teach you the wording you want to protect your specific interests if you are unsure of how to make the changes.<p>For some classes of software, you can separate out the R&D to a standalone company, designate yet another company as a retailer/distributor, and sell only licenses through the retailer/distributor. The R&D company will not sell direct, &quot;as policy&quot; (if pressed, just say the R&D team just doesn&#x27;t want to get into the retail/wholesale side of the business, preferring someone with the appropriate skillset handle that for them). Anyone else who wants to be a retailer/distributor, has to have the appropriate skillset to support the product. It just so happens that only one company in the world so far can do that. As far as the F500 is concerned, you are now a third-party selling and supporting licenses, not the actual product itself. There is an exclusion of the &quot;grab everything we can&quot; clauses in every purchasing contract I&#x27;ve seen for third-party licenses. This is because the F500&#x27;s realize Microsoft won&#x27;t sell them Office (for example) if they made a grab for IP via purchasing of licenses.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before, but it bears repeating. Hacker effectiveness follows a power law, and business savvy does as well. You denigrate and ignore the high-effectiveness business people at your peril, as you have found out. Just because the majority of business people are mediocre like the majority of programmers, does not mean you can do without them.",1419694483

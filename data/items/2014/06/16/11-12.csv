There are some guides in internet how to do it, but to put it simple(and this worked for me like a charm) - you have to get out of your comfort zone. push yourself to do things you would never normally do in public. it&#x27;s not easy to do this, but after about a month you can just feel this CLICK. its really life changing. you just have to keep doing it, no matter how awkward it gets.",1402919874

Although this is probably not a coincidental connection between all of these facts, it doesn&#x27;t mean JyZyXEL is somehow connected to the TrueCrypt developers. However, I&#x27;m making a note of it here in case there are further developments, or someone just wants to ask him what else he might know.<p>Or maybe Google suggests the term because Zyxel&#x27;s NAS product line is called NSA (e.g. <a href=""http://www.zyxel.com/de/de/products_services/nsa325.shtml?t=p"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zyxel.com/de/de/products_services/nsa325.shtml?t=...</a> ).

7898513,comment,7898035,7898035,1,0,Lennu,,,"Clubs, sports and other group events doesn&#x27;t solve the underlaying problem that in order to get friends or to become friends with someone you have to be interested in that person. If you are interested at someone and value him/her you will most likely like to spend time with them.<p>Everyone is saying that making friends as an adult is hard. Small talk, meeting new people, being friends is actually really easy. Just be interested about the guy/gal and listen to their story. I think you shouldn&#x27;t even think that &quot;hey today I&#x27;m going to make a friend&quot;, they are people, all of us are precious and have a great story to tell. You meet them everyday and if you just wish to get to know them better, listen and be interested. If you can&#x27;t find the interest to listen to other people or do something with them, you will probably end up not having too many friends. Think about the motives why you want to meet new friends and why haven&#x27;t you made them yet, what is the underlaying cause? Usually it is not that you are an introvert or can&#x27;t speak the language properly. And this is something that you need to work with yourself.<p>Sure sports and clubs can help with the meeting process but as there are people everywhere, it is not the only way. You should go into these things if you want to do the subject of the club.",1402919627

I live in the Netherlands and a lot of people now (about 30%) have a mortgage that is worth more than the house. That is not a huge problem as long as they are able to pay the mortgage each month and do not have a pressing reason to move, do not get divorced, etc. but if they do need/want to move they end up with a debt for the difference of the value of the house and the mortgage (In this country, you cannot just walk away from your house and debt, you always remain responsible for the debt).<p>I think the fact that 30% of all houses here are &quot;underwater&quot; is a better sign of a housing bubble than the amount of foreclosures because at least where I live in many cases banks prefer not to foreclose but put the house on the regular market and hope to sell it for a reasonable prices.",1402919556

My intent was to do the &quot;responsible&quot; thing and buy a lease return or some slightly used vehicle. However, with the price difference, the warranty on that versus a new car, the APR I could get on a new vehicle (0%) versus a used one (2.75%), and how long I intended to keep the vehicle swung me to buying new. The warranty in particular was a key selling point because I was moving to a new city with no social net to help if I suddenly had to have massive car repairs. Been there, done that, it&#x27;s not fun.<p>There was some other intangibles. I have full service records for my car, there&#x27;s no risk of &quot;hidden&quot; damage, I didn&#x27;t have to bother with taking it to a mechanic to get checked out.<p>Bottom line is run the numbers before blatantly assuming it&#x27;s &quot;money to burn&quot;.

People still start new projects in Fortran and Lisp; there are natural islands in the North Sea newer than these languages.<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to <i>feel</i> like C++ is due for replacement when it isn&#x27;t really. Yes, it&#x27;s easy to be jealous about all the new things going on in other languages but that&#x27;s in languages that sacrifice performance. If you&#x27;re using C++ correctly, you&#x27;re in a performance critical environment (either low memory, fast speed or steady speed). Or you have a lot of integration with C/C++. From this position, the only place you can currently go is from C++ down to C.<p>Honestly, there just isn&#x27;t an apples-for-apples replacement for C++ at the moment. Rust is the only serious effort out there at minimum/zero overhead programming but it&#x27;s 6 months away from 1.0, longer still before people get used to large scale design patterns that work well in the language and type system and much longer before it approaches the level of third-party library support that C++ has.<p>Yes, Boost needs a lot more work. C++ has traditionally had a woefully inadequate platform independent standard library, relying too heavily on Win32 or Qt or Carbon for things that should have been platform independent.<p>But frankly, C++ is doing okay. It has never been the easiest of languages to use but it hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse. It&#x27;s actually gotten better with C++11 and C++14 and with clang on the scene and libc++ providing a libstdc++ alternative and Microsoft finally trying to reach standards compliance.",1402919082

Recycling an aluminum can use much less energy than converting the aluminum oxide to metallic aluminum (perhaps only a 10%).

In a normal electric car (for example a Tesla) you charge the battery every night at home. This aluminum battery is ârechargedâ in the smelters only a few times in a year. In both cases the energy from the recharge comes from oil, gas, solar, wind turbines, nuclear, hydroelectric or whatever is cheaper there.

I say this because extreme introverts enjoy being alone. I used to think I leaned toward introversion, but gradually between high school and college I realized that I enjoyed having a big circle of friends--what I didn&#x27;t enjoy was the social context of school. I&#x27;m a drinks in a nice lounge kinda guy, and the social scene in college was more house parties, tail gates, and/or video game tournaments. One of the nice things about post-graduation is that you have a range of social settings to choose from.<p>My advice would be to stop thinking of yourself as an &quot;introvert&quot; and understand that you&#x27;re probably somewhere in the middle, like most people. Figure out what kind of social context you like and gravitate to that. Don&#x27;t assume because you&#x27;re an &quot;asian engineer&quot; that the best fit for you is that stereotypical social context. I&#x27;m a first generation immigrant, went to math/science high school, went to engineering school, but half my friends are public interest lawyers. I gravitate to that personality type. Your words suggest that you put yourself in a box, but that doesn&#x27;t have to be the case.<p>Also, don&#x27;t assume you&#x27;re &quot;awkward.&quot; Maybe you are, but here&#x27;s a secret: a lot of the people you think of as &quot;socially normal&quot; simply have a head start by virtue of having grown up in this culture. There&#x27;s a lot of forced childhood socialization that immigrants miss out on: church, block parties, etc. My wife used to go to cornfield parties as a kid in Iowa. That kind of low-key, parentally-supervised, non-threatening socialization helps build basic skills, but its something immigrant kids often miss out on because their families don&#x27;t feel comfortable participating in the community.",1402918198

You certainly wouldn&#x27;t use the word in a professional setting, but were you in a pub you might not be too surprised to overhear someone using it. Also there are degrees to this word here. In the states someone either is a cunt or they are not. Here you might be &quot;a bit of a cunt.&quot; For whatever reason I find that difference amusing.<p>Second, the subtle one - the word &quot;average.&quot; In the states it has no connotation. We typically use it in a very mathematical sense. If we call something &quot;average&quot; we mean it&#x27;s close to the mean/median of our experience of that thing.

7898379,comment,7898035,7898035,6,0,gima,,,"Here&#x27;s my opinionated two cents.<p>I&#x27;m 27 and an introvert and I think that the biggest change that I&#x27;ve experienced these past few years has been to loosen up my thinking regarding what others think of me. This has helped me to be more relaxed around other people, and that leads to body language changes, which again leads to other people subconsciously behaving more positively around and towards me. Later I&#x27;ve come to understood that I was viewed as a cold and non-caring, whereas in reality I was shit scared and stiff around other people. Also one thing that I&#x27;ve come to recognize after reading some articles and doing self-studying is, that my batteries drain around other people, and I need alone-time to recharge them. Whereas for extroverts the drain-charge cycle works exactly the opposite way.<p>I&#x27;m getting a bit off-track here. Let me comment on some of the writings in the comments:\nI&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s an &quot;america&quot;-thing, but I don&#x27;t know many people at all that want to talk about themselves. It&#x27;s not like I would want to talk about myself, I know myself already. Ofcourse that helps the other person get to know me, but personally I think that the other person is immensely more interesting in regards to whom to talk about. So beware of going all-out on making the other person tell things about themselves, one might come to feel uneasy quite fast.<p>What sn0wBuM said. You need to _actually_ care about other people to keep in contact with them. I apparently don&#x27;t, because only ever I contact other people when I want to be with them for one reason or another or need something from them. Hence most of the time I dont keep in contact, and that is just the way I am. Contacting someone just to say &quot;Hi, what&#x27;s up! Long time no see!&quot; and having a half-assed conversation when neither of the party has anything real to say is, in my opinion, one of the stupidest things to do. Though this part of my behavior might be heavily affected by my nationality, Finnish, because we are silent and (look) grumpy most of the time, nor de we have a concept of &quot;small talk&quot;. We mean business or we rarely talk.<p>And while books are good, academic knownledge of how to socialize doesn&#x27;t do the trick. Actually doing, does.<p>Meeting new people? Well. You&#x27;re among people now, so get to know some odd pervert on the net around the same shady corners you spend your time on and you might actually find more deeper friend-relationships than trying to find people offline, where the variety and amount of choices might not be as vast. I found like-minded people at conventions and via board-games. If you don&#x27;t feel like you fit (for real, not under self-pity), then don&#x27;t try to fit, and find another kind of people.<p>Unless your language is unintelligible, then I don&#x27;t believe for a second it to be a problem. If you&#x27;re nice person at heart, it usually shines through. But if you are an obnoxious person, you&#x27;re obnoxious no matter if you master the language perfectly. As long as you get the point through :)<p>&quot;Making friends is incredibly difficult for adults.&quot;\nBull. Most adults try &quot;to be adult&quot; (not jumping with one leg in the air at center of the street etc. &quot;dummy&quot; things), which makes it more difficult to get to know them, because they try to blend in and not be individuals (but they all want to). So if you can overcome _your_ fear of trying to communicate with people, others rarely stop you. (Though don&#x27;t start a conversation plain-blank on the streets with a stranger in Finland for the sake of befriending them, they might think you are loose from a mental hospital.)<p>I dont talk much. I don&#x27;t (can&#x27;t) take part in conversations because 99% of the time I have absolutely nothing to say.

However, once I started studying physics (never been much of a nerd myself), I met a lot of socially awkward people. Since I was new to this kind of culture, I tried to find out as much about why a lot of these people have so many problems connecting to others, even though they are generally quite smart.<p>Before I go on to list the tips, here&#x27;s something I learned from having been in a psychotherapie myself (different reasons, though): Be <i>absolutely</i> clear that the investments your have to do (overcoming your angst) are huge, and wil only slowly diminish. You <i>will</i> need to force yourself to action.<p>Now here&#x27;s some things I gathered:<p>* Being good at social interactions is a skill that needs to be trained. Remember how long it took to become a hacker? And how bad you were at first at it? Same thing with talking to strangers. However, while hacking awful code can still be a rewarding experience, having an awkward conversation is probably not. Try and work on that first: Every time you&#x27;ve managed to start a conversation, regardless where, with whom or how it went, reward yourself (think about how fucking hard it was to do it, and you dit it! Also, probably none of the bad things you imagined happened). As important: Do it consistently (yes, standard time management techniques help).<p>* Maximize your exposure to other people. Join a choir (even if you can&#x27;t sing â this is a great place to learn it), learn sports (martial arts seem to be popular with nerds), or join some other club. There are other great tips here. It&#x27;s OK if it takes time to make friends â use the regular sessions to practice casual conversation.<p>* Experiment with drinking a little (like beer or wine), when you go out. I know, this really sounds like bad advice, but it helps for quite a lot of people I know. Avoid being drunk, however! Generally, avoid drinking if you want to talk to girls, especially if you are not used it. Sober you might be shy (not a bad thing per se, can be really sweet), drunk you risk to appear creepy.<p>* I <i>heavily</i> suggest <i>not</i> trying to change your looks, or you body language, or anything superficial, based on what you think makes you appear more confident. It won&#x27;t change anything relevant. Moreover, I havent&#x27;t met a single socially awkward person who was able to pull this off (trying to appear confident). Try to feel natural, even if you can&#x27;t always feel comfortable.<p>* Practice your English skills in conversation. There&#x27;s no other way to become fluent (I&#x27;m not a native English speaker myself, and my English is OK at best, but it&#x27;s enough). Try to remember phrases of other people you liked. Generally, people don&#x27;t care if your English isn&#x27;t perfect, but I know from experience (in more than one language): The better you know the language, the safer you feel in a conversation.<p>* Best tip I read here on HN: Care about other people.<p><i>But:</i> If you feel that this is all too much at your stage, and if you keep re-iterating destructive thoughts, I recommend seeking therapy. _Rational emotive behavior therapy_ has been shown to help[2]. Group therapy might be an alternative to regular psycotherapy sessions.<p>BTW: Congratulations! Starting a thread on HN was a great idea. You&#x27;ll need determination and willpower, but you&#x27;re off to a good start.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_thera...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.jiaap.org/Listing_Detail/Logo/ba65b0f5-6158-4c3d-b135-28bed1573ced.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jiaap.org/Listing_Detail/Logo/ba65b0f5-6158-4c3d-...</a>",1402917076

And it will be easier for the other person to open up as well.<p>It also works in professional settings. It is better to work with people who are willing to say upfront &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, rather than keeping quiet and ending up doing a bad job, because they were afraid to look weak.<p>So if you want someone to confide something, tell them one of your secret first.

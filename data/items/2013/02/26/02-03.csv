The problem with allowing rwx pages in an iOS process via WebKit is that they can be used by the native app to load rogue code in.<p>This is a really difficult problem to solve and I honestly think Apple chose the easy way out: disallow it all.<p>I do think a solution is coming though. Already in iOS6 a bunch of ViewControllers are running <i>out of process</i>. See the link below. I think this will lead to out of process, <i>and fully JITted</i> WebKit in a future release.<p>Many times people think Apple is making some weird technical decision on purpose to annoy developers it is really just a pragmatic decision to get a product out of the door on time. This happens all the time and everywhere.

And given enough large organizations, there will be problems.<p>Given the number of large government entities, there's a lot of room for bad oversight.<p>But on top of that there is also often a lot more openness when the auditors does their jobs in government departments and these things are discovered, and even if not, the press often has a lot more access (e.g. freedom of information requirements).<p>In a lot of companies, a lot of borderline behaviour will instead just lead to people getting fired, especially when there is no evidence.<p>A new CTO at a company a friend does work for ""decided to part ways"" with his company a while back, for example, after migrating a substantial part of their service to a new, totally over-engineered and untested platform that failed spectacularly after they'd very publicly spent a massive amount of money on it. Incompetence or corruption? Probably impossible to prove.<p>And to the public there was no real sign anything was wrong: The launch was highly publicized by the company, and they never told anyone about the negative effects later. Only people with insight into internal sales numbers until they made emergency changes to revert some of his more harmful decisions would know.<p>And for him it likely doesn't even matter that he was effectively fired: He's either a useful fool, or a useful accomplice, for someone who will happily make use of their network to help him land somewhere else. And many potential hirers will only remember the positive press attention prior to the launch and will have no way of knowing about the problems.<p>There are a lot of stories like that in private business too.",1361847535

But the company itself didn't seem to either have an effective way of policing it, or maybe even really an interest.

I've used Backbone on one project and I kind of like the MVC aspect for some things but the thing I'm working on right now is more of a traditional web app. There are some interactive forms where it kind of makes sense to have a model and a view that reacts to changes in the model, but in the end the form is POSTing to a standard rails controller rather than using AJAX calls to update fields when they change.

Maybe you have a couple ajax-y interactions for speed or UI responsiveness and everything is happy-go-lucky for a while.<p>Over time, you find that you start wanting more data in more views, or large collections of items that you want to manipulate visually on the client side, with no need to bother on the server side. One by one, each view starts accumulating async, non-event based cruft. The callbacks become nightmarish.<p>The JSON Api makes it easier to build those data heavy, complex views become more responsive. And they can change on the fly! The javascript MVC is a way to manage the the complexity and hopefully pairs well with a good event driven system.<p>The point is, if you know your application is going to be sufficiently complex, it makes sense to build it as client side rendered to begin with. Other great benefits can include:<p>- JSON API leaves you primed and ready to build native mobile apps or 3rd party integration<p>- Your js developers don't have to wait for backend devs to modify half-complete ajax views if you have a good api<p>- Your template rendering happens in once place instead of two, making it easier to isolate logic<p>Obviously it's not worth the trouble if you only have a few models/resources and you are dealing with a very read heavy application. It is also a lot more work to implement two MVC layers instead of one, but you may sleep better at night.",1361845922

I've flip-flopped a lot on this issue myself, looking at both sides I think good interactive web design is just simply hard no matter how you slice it.<p>I've done Rails+PJAX along with minimalistic simple jQuery components (similar to Bootstrap's javascript) I think it works quite well for very simple content focused designs but falls short as interactions get more complicated. Lots of convinces that I find in modern JS-MVCs (Angular and Ember come to mind) are missing, like model-DOM bindings (so not Backbone).<p>Now I'm playing around with AngularJS on something new and building that on top of Rails as an API (and for asset pipeline support which works quite well with Angular). This is also pretty good. Angular's style fills in a lot of gaps on the client-side that jQuery components did not. However I also see myself duplicating efforts in the views that would be more effortless on the Rails side. This is a side effect of different tools doing different things. I can't really take advantage of certain rails-isms if I choose this route, but the trade-off seems ok for me as I do feel it makes much of the interactive design on the client-side easier (so far, so good anyways).<p>That said I don't yet feel like I can really come down on either side of the debate in terms of what is better for me. I do think if you switch in Rails for ""client-side MVC"" most of the author's statements are ironcially still true. Particularly the statement ""they lock you into certain patterns"" is arguably more true for doing everything the ""Rails way"" than for a good client-side MVC library.<p>I do want to say two things. One, I've found Backbone to be the least productive of both of the choices I described above. It was a step up for a team with minimal Javascript experience, but once I understood the lay of the land I left it since I didn't really feel it was doing anything for me. Two, Backbone is definitely not what I would call a client-side MVC pattern. It lacks model bindings for starters.<p>I'd like to see what the author thinks after some more time looking at the latest Ember or Angular. I'm also looking to see what happens with Flight as that is sort of a beefed up version of the components+events approach I had been taking before. Again, perhaps both approaches have their place depending on what your needs are.<p>Addendum: When I was doing Rails+PJAX I sort of envisioned a concept where I delivered both data, layout and style with HTML+CSS (as semantic as needed) and used JS to handle interaction. Interestingly none of the MVC frameworks seem to support doing this very well (including Angular which seems best suited to the concept). Flight seems to which is why I find it interesting.",1361845798

So you're not forgoing your gain for nothing: you're forgoing your gain for one round to ensure equitable treatment in future rounds.<p>It's like a two-layered prisoner's dilemma.<p>First, imagine the simpler dilemma: you have to players, the Chooser (who chooses the split) and the Decider (who decides to take it).  You just play the same game over and over again, choose and decide, choose and decide, with no role switching.  If you're the Decider, you could settle for a 30-70 split, but over the dozens or hundreds of iterations that's a lot of money lost.  It's worth it to forgo some short term gain to keep the Chooser in line.  Eventually you end up with a 50-50 split, and your profits are maximized.<p>In the second layer, imagine you have two pools of Choosers and Deciders.  In each game, a Chooser and a Decider are randomly matched up.  In this game, you might imagine there's no incentive to forgo short-term gain for long-term, but there is.  The trick is that you -- the Decider -- are not just in a Dilemma with your Chooser on each round, you're also in a Dilemma with your other Deciders.<p>Imagine you have two Deciders, A & B, who have each been offered the same 30-70 split by their Chooser.<p>If Decider A and Decider B both reject it, maybe on the next round they get each other's Choosers, who then offer them each a 50-50 split.  In the long run, their profits are maximized.<p>If Decider A and Decider B both accept it, on the next round their Choosers might offer them an even worse split.  They profit, but far less than before.<p>If Decider A accepts and Decider B rejects, Decider A profits maximally (next round he gets a 50-50 split from Chooser B, without forgoing any profit) and Decider B profits minimally (he forgoes profit this round and gets a 30-70 split or worse next round from Chooser A).<p>This is now reduced to the classic Prisoner's Dilemma.  If the Deciders cooperate (by rejecting bad offers from Choosers they may never see again) they all profit, if they all defect they're all worse off in the long run, and if some defect (and accept the bad offers) while others cooperate they profit even more to the detriment of their good compatriots.<p>Throwing away $200+ dollars to spite a stranger cheating you out of $200+ more dollars isn't just about spite; it's about forcing them to cooperate with other strangers so you have a better ecosystem of strangers to cooperate with.",1361844171

5283380,comment,5283160,5283160,119,0,nikcub,,,"I have first hand experience with this, although in Australia. My first job was working for a IT development and solutions shop (this is over 17 years ago) where they won the bid to rollout the internet and network gateways across a large number of Australian government schools.<p>We were doing similar work for private school at the same time, and the process for the public and private school could not be more different.<p>For eg. in the tender process, which I was part of, for private school we would use cheaper Taiwanese routers. For the public schools it 'had to be Cisco'. The only time we ever used Cisco, outside of large enterprise clients with 1000+ seats, was with public school tenders. The private school would get a $500 white-label router, the public school s would get a $6-15k Cisco router with additional VPN module costs.<p>We would charge a higher consultant rate on the Cisco jobs, and would bill 3 days instead of 1. We won the contract because we were 50% cheaper than the other tenders who all wanted to install 3 and 5-series routers. How we got to the point of being able to even tender is another story that involves somebody in our organization sleeping with somebody at the government organization. The other tenderers were accustomed to dividing the work up amongst themselves at inflated prices, they didn't even know who we were and we received a lot of abuse for breaking up their little scheme.<p>(Edit: a further idea of how this worked, the 3 people in the gov office responsible for tenders all had very nice cars and holiday homes while the rest of the office was working away on below-average wages. You could see what was going on just by looking at the car park)<p>So a dozen of us roll out hundreds of these routers in public schools and after a month we find that we rolled out the wrong version of IOS, one that was vulnerable to a simple security attack. Instead of forcing us to upgrade all the routers remotely, or out of our own pocket, we instead won another few-million-dollars worth of work to send a person out and apply the upgrade to each router (which took 5 minutes, we charged a full day plus travel).<p>The routers weren't even being used properly - the topography was net connection -> cisco router -> internal server -> switches. The internal server would do all the DHCP and everything else. These expensive routers were being used as bridges, although they were pitched as having 'forward compatibility' incase the school wanted to implement features such as user accounts (they did, although again they used a custom server, not the router).<p>When these projects are audited there is nobody who is technically competent enough to make an argument against who would be on the side of ditching or shrinking the projects. Some of the smarter teachers knew what was going on but didn't mind since they got access to fancy equipment (we would create user accounts for them).<p>My first, and not my last, experience with government bureaucracy and budgets. I would estimate that the private schools got more out of us at a tenth of the cost. Since then I had an even worse experience with the government health department, where 6-figure invoices were written and paid for goods that didn't exist (that department has since been broken up and the subject of a large corruption enquire). No surprise that I became very anti-government size and spending.<p>Edit: to add, we were so 'disruptive' to the backdoor deals that we were uninvited from conferences, kicked off panels, not invited to the mixer events where gov buyers met providers, a couple of years later we lost our accreditation[0] temporarily until we appealed to the Government Minister. On site we would be locked out of network cabinets, not given IP information for the net connections, etc. Our jobs were made difficult by competitors and others because of our pricing and methods. They couldn't figure out how they didn't get rid of us, because they didn't know that one of our guys had a solid relationship with somebody at the government (that person wanted to clean things up). Usually we wouldn't have been allowed anywhere near these projects and if we did win one we wouldn't be allowed back in for not playing with the system.<p>[0] 'accreditation' for government tenders needs to die, it is a formal method used to keep honest operators out of what is essentially a cartel. The Australian government is getting better in this regard[1], they now have an open tender website but I believe it still requires some form of accreditation that has a person in a department standing between application and approval.<p>[1] although not too much better. NBN Co., a government owned company that is building a $40 billion nation-wide fibre network recently suspended tender process because every single bid came in over the expected price:<p><a href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/high-prices-force-nbn-to-suspend-cabling-tender-process-and-look-elsewhere/story-e6frgaif-1226031831542"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/high-price...</a>",1361844074

The world needs a bold example to realize that no economy exempt from corrosion due to inner perversities.<p>I came to America with a lot of ideas,energy and passion. I came  as a successful professional with experience and with great hopes of contributing. I chose to enroll in a graduate level program in order to validate my skills and join ""the system"".<p>But today I take that plane. The plane that takes you back to your home country as a failure. The plane that carries indebted, unemployed, suicidal and ""broken-in-a-thousand-pieces"" international MBA students.<p>My first mistake was believing in graduate education. A system that is completely broken and one that relies on lies to become self sustainable. After enrolling, I quickly found out how my school polished its recruitment figures, how they sugar-coat everything and how they make bad things look good. This was the first blow. Realizing that America lies to us international students in order to boosts figures and make their programs more appealing to national students. Pretty soon I discovered this practice was commonplace across every school.<p>I discovered that 25% of international students default their loans. But school officials don't tell you that. Discrimination is rampant, that the tell you, however nothing can prepare you for the forthcoming crude reality: you're being set up for failure.<p>You'll be treated like a slave, with no immigration options other than the current messed up status quo. You'll make no friends because ""the whities"" party on their own. And you'll need to wait at least a decade for that ""green-card"". Oh, wait,  you owe us 200K dollars for an education that's substantially inferior to the one you received in your home country. I expected some of this, but not to this extent. The educational experience, ""the contacts"" and ""the help"" I received only amount to one thing: Grand Fiasco.<p>The extent of this exploitation has no limits. America doesn't validate foreign titles and, allows for thousands of Cuban PHDs that make a living driving cabs in Florida. You can't come to this country based on your skills, you need a patron: An employer or a university. Slavery anyone!<p>Indians have to wait in line for decades just to get a level of pay that will be comparable to what they where earning in the home countries. The  Chinese must be content with middle-management jobs with no hopes of promotion because they're synonym to ""grunt-workers"". And Latinos, even engineers, most have to work as freelancers because their titles are not recognized by the government (even when the American universities they came to study in did recognized those titles).<p>But you know what, all this is fine with me. I can live with that level of filth. So far this only amounts to ""Wall Street level"" shit.<p>The fun part comes later, after graduation. That's when it really gets to you. When you go to a dinner party with your fellow classmates and get asked that nice question by the white guy that didn't get a job and almost didn't graduate. That golden moment when he asks you: ""Did you get your papers?"".<p>And then I came to me. The sadistic Americans need to pick on someone to justify their problems. It's because of the republicans, the blacks, Bin Laden or the Latino rice pickers!\nIts ALWAYS somebody else. And WE have to create a ""jail-like"" system in order to prevent our white Ivy-educated pricks from shacking the hands of ""unholy"" international students.<p>America is broken. Perversity starts in the college rankings and then perpetuates in the business world. Lies, fraud, heavy drug use, discrimination, promiscuity, exploitation and under-achievement, these are but a few traits of the broken educational system.<p>I never thought I would find myself in this situation. Seeking to disassociate from my university after graduation from an elite MBA program, jobless, discriminated and labeled as a failure by hundreds. Indeed, God Bless America.

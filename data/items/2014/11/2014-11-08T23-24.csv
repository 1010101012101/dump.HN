As I understand the project&#x27;s aims (and I&#x27;m not involved, I just read all the docs a few months back), it&#x27;s more important that the Internet of the future is not a tangled mess of technologies that are insecure on different layers.

And remember, even though the term API has been borrowed in the past few years to mean &quot;protocol&quot;, <i>API</i> in the context of this case pertains only to its classical meaning. As such, a specific API is indeed a method of operating code, but also a very elaborate text -- including specific class names and method names (and a specific ordering of parameters). None of the names is essential for replicating the functionality of the code. For example, String.length() could have just as easily been named string.len() or Str.size(). Because Googles &quot;JDK&quot; isn&#x27;t actually the JDK -- and therefore does not interoperate with any actual JDK classes -- but simply a copy of them, the names, organization, etc. are absolutely <i>not necessary</i> in order to operate Google&#x27;s code. Google&#x27;s code was never meant to interoperate with Java, but to replicate it (once they&#x27;ve disregarded Java&#x27;s GPL license this may not matter, but they&#x27;ve also broken the JDK&#x27;s license in other ways, namely, they&#x27;ve made a partial, incompatible implementation). How, then, is the API being &quot;a method of operating code&quot; relevant to the matter at hand?",1415490815

If you&#x27;re designing a new system, don&#x27;t use MD5 or SHA-1; if you&#x27;re using a legacy system, organize some sort of orderly panic (just like the CA/Browser forum is doing with SHA-1 certificates).<p>Second, because it&#x27;s not &quot;basically arbitrary&quot;: the content almost always looks like it&#x27;s been specifically designed to make room for a hash collision. For binary formats like images and PDFs, it&#x27;s easy to put a large amount of unrendered data in the file format that isn&#x27;t visible in a viewer, which is exactly why the newsworthy collisions have been images and PDFs.

If your queue doesn&#x27;t provide ordering across multiple threads, it can&#x27;t meaningfully be called a multi-threaded queue, so it&#x27;s not very fair to compare it to genuine multi-threaded queues. Unless I&#x27;ve misread the documentation, this is just a collection of SPMC queues, together with a read operation that checks all the queues for an item to dequeue, right? But there is no synchronization that occurs to tie any of these SPMC queues together. Even if you wrapped every single access to this data structure in a lock, for instance, you would not be able to ensure FIFO ordering of elements inserted into it.<p>I think the estimation that having inter-thread ordering requirements is uncommon is incorrect. Probably the most common use of MPMC queues is as a concurrency primitive in systems using a CSP-like abstraction, where such requirements are extremely common.

I.e. you can&#x27;t take a C header file and delete the parameter names, and replace all the types with typedef&#x27;ed names and get a different API. So the question is whether that (whatever you call it) is copyrightable. And under 17 USC 102, how you answer that question is to look at whether that is original and creative.<p>> 1. API&#x27;s are not expressions of anything. They are literally interfaces. An outline of a story in abstract terms is not copyrightable. The actual story is. Such should it be with API&#x27;s. API&#x27;s are not copyrightable, their implementations are.
2. The fact that it is hard work and requires careful thought is 100% irrelevant in united states copyright law, since we have no sweat of the brow doctrine.<p>Of course, but something being hard work and requiring a lot of thought is indicative of whether it requires originality or creativity. Take, for example, the POSIX file API&#x27;s. That specific combination of orthogonal function calls, the concept of passing around file descriptors as small integers, etc, is definitely a creative expression, distinct from the underlying functionality. And it&#x27;s a distinct creative expression from, e.g., the Win32 file API&#x27;s, which express similar functionality in a very different way.",1415488722

8578455,comment,8576837,8576837,0,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Good essay. The dynamic scoping / mutable global state issue, especially with respect to rounding modes, is a total nightmare. We&#x27;ve been trying our hardest to provide great support for rounding modes in Julia and it just doesn&#x27;t work well. The trouble is that there are functions that need normal rounding regardless of the current rounding mode while other operations can safely respect the current rounding mode. There are still other functions for which neither is appropriate. A software-implemented sin function, for example, may completely break if used with an unexpected rounding mode, so you don&#x27;t want that. But you also don&#x27;t want to just completely ignore the rounding mode either. What you really want is a sin function that returns a correct result, rounded according to the rounding mode. But that means you really need five variants of the sin function and you need to dynamically dispatch between them based on the current rounding mode – i.e. global mutable state – which is, of course, quite bad for performance, not to mention the explosion of complexity. I&#x27;ve come to believe that the rounding mode concept as designed in IEEE 754 was only ever feasible to use when you were writing your own assembly code.<p>The essay is not quite right about the motivation for rounding modes – they are not intended to support interval arithmetic. When we got the chance to ask him about it, Kahan was quite negative about interval arithmetic, noting that intervals tend to grow exponentially large as your computation progresses. Instead, the motivation he suggested was that you could run a computation in all the rounding modes, and if the results in all of them were reasonably close, you could be fairly certain that the result was accurate. Of course, at the higher level the essay is exactly right: the fact that this motivation isn&#x27;t explained in the IEEE 754 spec is precisely what allowed this misunderstanding about the motivation to occur at all.",1415488257

    copyright infringement? Can I write something myself  
    that means the same? Or do I have to link to the spec

</code></pre>
Giving a summary is allowed even in the most draconian of interpretations of copyright. More loosely, pulling a quote of a few lines is standard for any sort of academic exercise; essays on novels certainly don&#x27;t have you pull out the novel when they want to quote a bit of text.<p><pre><code>    What if your language doesn’t have exceptions? What 
    does it mean to provide a status flag? 
</code></pre>
You certainly have places elsewhere in your language for handling errors. How do you handle integer divide by zero? How do you handle timeouts when doing networking? How do you handle disk full errors? I hope you don&#x27;t go stomping along after an error in those cases.<p><pre><code>    This may have made sense at the time of the original 
    spec in 1985 but it’s mutable global state – something 
    that has long been recognized as problematic and which 
    languages are increasingly moving away from.
</code></pre>
This is because statelessness is a leaky abstraction. Your machine&#x27;s saving to disk, it&#x27;s allocating memory for other things, it&#x27;s pulling in stuff and shooting stuff over the network. Floating point has lots of knobs that you need to turn because there are various rounding rules for various problem domains. You&#x27;ve almost certainly got a type system for your language, perhaps your answer is to create, or have a way to create, a floatRoundUp type for when a user needs to go beyond your default rules. In a pure functional definition, I think one way to consider the problem is to think of a floating point type as the actual number and the state registers. If you don&#x27;t care, then just use the number part, if the state register matters, put those in too. Saving flags means that you can get repeatability. With a given set of flags, you&#x27;ll always get the same answer.<p><pre><code>    Program block? Attribute specification? Nothing else in 
    my language works this way. How do I even apply this in 
    practice? If attributes are lexically scoped then that 
    would mean rounding modes only apply to code textually 
    within the scope – if you call out to a function its 
    operations will be unaffected. If on the other hand 
    attributes are dynamically scoped then it works with 
    the functions you call – but dynamically scoped state 
    of this flavor is really uncommon these days, most 
    likely nothing else in your language behaves this way.
</code></pre>
There are two ways of handling this problem. Decide for the user, or expose the functionality needed to provide scoped floating point. The most &quot;pure&quot; way sounds like using the aforementioned type system to give defaults, but have a way for the user to tweak the rules as needed. You&#x27;re the designer, one of your jobs is to make these sorts of decisions for the user. Things like your i/o library probably have similar problems, I don&#x27;t see why floating point is all that much different.",1415487765

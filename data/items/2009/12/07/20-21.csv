Seemed like a waste to not go for 100,000.)<p>Last time I was checking in at Chicago, I had a conversation with the check-in agent and I mentioned my mileage run plans.  She told me, ""that's excellent"".  So unlike the Mint, the airlines, or AA anyway, don't seem to mind this.  It fills up their otherwise empty planes over the Atlantic :)<p><i>I have a hunch, though that after flying first class all next year on American, I'm going to have a really hard time flying coach again. I'm afraid this might be a bit addictive.</i><p>This is a nice benefit, but it is not the best.  Domestic first class is not that great.  The seat is a bit bigger, and you get a $10 meal for free.  The best part is the coffee cups your coffee is served in.  AA just bought new ones, and they are very pretty.<p>Also, you don't lose the ability to upgrade next year.  You will be in F for the next 3 years.  Exec Plat drops to Plat even if you don't fly at all, and Plat drops to Gold even if you don't fly at all.  You will have to use stickers to upgrade, though, it is no longer free.  Back when I was Gold, I had pretty good luck getting upgrades, and as a Plat, I have only missed one.  You get the ability to book exit rows either way, and on the MD-80, the exit rows have more leg room than the first class seats.<p>So you are set for a while.<p><i>worth $300-400 each if I sell them</i><p>AA is pretty good at shutting this down.  I would not recommend it.  If you're not going to use them, share them with your friends (or fellow mileage-runners on HN) instead.<p>(Search the Flyertalk forums for stories of people losing 1MM+ frequent flyer miles for selling their SWUs.)<p>Anyway, you might want to read the forums on Flyertalk: <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-aadvantage-445/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/american-aadvantage-445/</a>",1260219498

982119,comment,981123,981943,0,0,gizmo,,," - the real and apparent motives of the AI can be completely different. If the AI is evil it would argue the exact same thing in order to deceive us meatbags. So we can't take the word of the AI at face value. If the AI does break out of its box, it could dominate the world if it wanted to. There's nothing we could do to stop it -- it's smarter than we are.<p>- a mathematical proof is only a proof in a certain context. It would be easy for the AI to get one of the assumptions subtly wrong, to abuse a flaw in our proof verification software, and so on. The correctness proof of a program can easily exceed the complexity of the program itself. Even if the proof were correct we cannot prevent it from doing evil things because evil is too difficult to define. Perhaps it has the ""good intention"" of liberating the earth from humans to allow for evolution of a more humane species.<p>- yes, but by allowing it to talk to the outside world you've completely freed it. Freeing an infinitely powerful being (compared to us) still seems unwise.<p>- it can give those reasons, but unless we have reason to believe the AI is trustworthy (and an evil AI is likely to fool us into believing it is) we'd be safer with the AI stuck in a box.",1260219346

I would say entrepreneurship is at least as important to the HN culture as engineering.<p>You ask a huge question, which is discussed every day all around the internet.<p>But to take a high level stab at it:<p>Marketing is crucial to an early-stage hardware startup to start to determine if anyone actually wants to buy what you're proposing to build.  Good luck getting money from a VC, much less a customer, if you can't talk intelligently about your target market, and demonstrate an ability to connect with it.<p>Sales becomes paramount after Version 1.0 is released, when you have to demonstrate that your business is actually profitable.  Many engineers are under the impression that, if the quality is high enough, the product will sell itself.  While this is true for the (tiny) subset of your market that cares enough to really investigate your product, it seems that a great sales team with a mediocre product will outsell a mediocre sales team with a great product more often than not.",1260219308

It's like frozen natural unflavored (well, now they have flavors) yogurt, sorta like greek yogurt. I actually like it because it's tart, I'm not a fan of more traditional sweet frozen yogurt when I can have richer ice cream instead. For plenty of people, it is an acquired taste...otherwise you can just go for their flavored yogurt. Pinkberry's chocolate flavor isn't really tart at all.<p>> I don't know a lot about the food business, but it seems like they're also in danger of being just another fad or over-expanding (ala Krispy Kreme).<p>Not only do I think it's a fad that's already passed, but also it doesn't help that a lot of other people saw potential here and went and opened up froyo shops on like every block in Los Angeles - pinkberry, red mango, yogurberry, yogurtland, cefiore, menchies, etc. Half of them (too generous maybe? two thirds?) have probably already gone out of business since that LA Times article was published in 2006 with the regularity with which they disappear and reappear and disappear. Not to mention the coffee shops, cafes and bakeries that decide to put in a froyo machine too.<p>Pinkberry itself, outside of a couple prime locations, is suffering here now.

If it were a chainsaw, then there would be no question whatsoever.<p>As it is, it's the team who has the soldering iron, who wrote the code, who designed and built the prototype, who figured out production against the other guy who is known for having occasionally hidden ties to companies he talks about on his blog, who has thus doubtful journalistic standards and who posted a couple pictures, promoted the device and published stories about how it would change the world, painting himself as an internet visionary turned hardware mogul.<p>I stay with the guy with the soldering iron on this one.<p>Interestingly, I also can't see US$ 299 as such a ludicrous price. I doubt an e-paper display is much less expensive than a LCD twice its size and there are devices in this space that cost $299.",1260216080

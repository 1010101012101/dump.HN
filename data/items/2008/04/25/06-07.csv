173374,comment,173198,173198,0,0,makecheck,,,"Xcode and vim for editing, Perl and Python for automation.<p>The nice thing about Xcode is that when you don't need or otherwise want to avoid the GUI integration, you can: build rules can run anything you want, like a makefile or other script, and even show you the raw output in a terminal-like split view.  Apple provides command-line access (/usr/bin/xcodebuild) for those cases where you want to start with an IDE-style project but still have direct build control from outside scripts.  I've only dabbled in VS2005, but Microsoft's environment never seemed ""avoidable"" in the same way.  The GUI tangled with every aspect of the project.  It was so awkward that I once cranked open ""vim"" from Linux (over SSH) to edit raw VS2005 XML, and it was much faster than tweaking the project through the GUI!<p>Speaking of ""vim"", I often use this for editing on Mac OS X.  It depends on the type of edit, I suppose; Xcode has some strengths (e.g. pulling a whole function out is easier with the mouse, and I often do edits based on project search results).  But ""vim"" is deceptively simple, and is ideal for many kinds of edits.  It has some pretty addictive features, like simple paren-matching with ""%"" even when in the middle of a function name.<p>It's <i>really</i> nice that Mac OS X ships with many scripting languages, because your project can depend on them.  For instance, you can automate many tasks in Python and Perl, and other Mac developers can still build your code without a headache.  Windows sucks for this; if you share a bunch of code that's heavily automated with scripts, odds are people will have to download and build all the interpreters you're using (and of course, you probably need a batch file to run it, because #!/usr/bin/perl is meaningless to Windows).  It's just a completely different environment...I find Mac development infinitely more productive for many reasons but the Unix tool set <i>alone</i> is an unbelievable starting point.",1209106481

And of course PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java (and others?)<p>But for GUI applications Cocoa is an excellent API built on a great language, Objective-C. Objective-C is a thin layer on top of C that adds very dynamic object oriented features (actually somewhat similar to Ruby). It might take a little while to get used to the syntax, but it's actually quite readable and pleasant.<p>Cocoa is pretty verbose, but between the named parameters (sort of) and verbose API names, it ends up being <i>very</i> readable code, almost like you're reading sentences of English. Some people don't like it, especially at first.<p>Apple has lots of documentation for iPhone devs too, which is also useful for new OS X devs. In particular:<p>* The video entitled ""iPhone Application Development - Getting Started"" @ <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/index.action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/index.action</a><p>* <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/gettingstarted/docs/objectivecprimer.action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/gettingstarted/docs/object...</a><p>More detail on Objective-C: <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Ob...</a><p>And Cocoa: <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_Cocoa/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/G...</a>",1209105843

Humans are smart because they're the descendants of a small group (some say around 2000 - so much for inbreeding being bad for your offspring, I guess) that managed to survive some terrible event at some point. The dumber ones died off.<p>Along those lines, btw, I read somewhere that even after this near extinction it was still only a limited number of people that actually produced any offspring. The worst example of this is the Inca and the Dahomey empires where only the emperor / king and a few highly placed officials could actually have sex, but even in Medieval Europe most peasant males (that is to say, most of the population) did not have any children at all.",1209105228

Under its banner there are quite a lot of startups taking on problems exactly like the malaria dilemma you describe in the piece. They come at the issue from the opposite side of the spectrum: they're reacting to all of the waste and inefficiency in the old fashioned non-profit world, where something gets done because a millionaire's brother's wife is interested in it and done badly because she's not very good at solving the problem. So, they're trying to harness the power of market forces and the attendant efficiencies and motivations that go with them in order to solve these big intractable social problems. The social entrepreneurship movement encompasses everything from micro-finance -- which was pioneered by Mohammed Yunnus at Gramin Bank (for which Yunnus just won the nobel prize) -- to a revolution in funder logic and an increased focus on effectiveness metrics.<p>I'd be curious to read your thoughts on social entrepreneurship from a startup point of view.",1209103876

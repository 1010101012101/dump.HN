We embrace, rather than stigmatize, failure.  Academics are conditioned to view failure as, at best, deeply embarrassing and, at worst, career-ending.<p>My experience is, of course, anecdotal, so take it for what it's worth.  The researchers I met cared more about science than money, and because they perceived the commercialization process as potentially damaging to their academic careers, they threw a huge fit when technology transfer was broached.  In the end, the university backed off (which warrants another discussion altogether).",1270166396

Of course that complicates matters !<p>What I don't understand is why wouldn't they take for example collocating their servers in multiple, geographically distributed, Data Centers.<p>Also, this doesn't need to be black and white. One could use ""the cloud"" to offload peak traffic/computation but if you have a predictable usage pattern, it becomes economical to also own hardware.<p>And I think this is the core of the matter: if you have an unpredictable scenario, it's better to rent. And being that startups and new projects are by definition rather volatile, it makes sense not to invest money into hardware. Not to mention that unless the company / project takes off, there <i>is</i> no money to actually buy hardware upfront. There is also no time to manage that hardware.",1270163279

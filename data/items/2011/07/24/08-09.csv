It also breaks down heavily when you want to spread your data across many servers. It is also not well suited to storing and querying billions of records -- sooner or later, your indexes are going to go beyond whatever storage / RAM capacity your servers have.<p>Btw, MySQL is a real RDBMS. Even if it lacks some features, it doesn't lack anything essential to calling it ""relational"" and talk about advantages or disadvantages of RDBMSs versus key-value stores or other NoSQL types.",1311497974

You will have plenty of time to switch to NoSQL as and if it becomes helpful.  Until that time, NoSQL is an expensive distraction you dont need.</i><p>Consider:<p>- how hard most organizations find it to refactor, rewrite, retest, especially in systems that are online 24x7<p>- when would you prefer to climb the learning curve with an immature technology, when you are small and starting out, or when you are a large company with a large set of users and under ""mission critical"" constraints (and possibly stockholders and the like.)<p>My guess is that ongoing companies find it extremely difficult and expensive (and wanting for talent) to switch from one sql database to another, much less switch from sql to nosql.",1311497563

All of the problems you mentioned <i>also exist in a non-functional language</i>. In a non-functional language, you have functions which live in IO, in StateT GameState IO, and pure functions. The only difference is that you must carefully read the code to figure out which is which.<p>The approach of having one gigantic state monad which goes everywhere is precisely what you do in an impure language - just with some syntactic sugar to hide the liftIO.",1311496817

Our iphone app lets users leave photos, videos, messages and more inside what we term living bubbles at any location. When they leave, their bubbles remain behind for others to discover. Bubbles can be cloned, modified, stored, carried, or moved elsewhere. These bubbles grow, divide, multiply and spread with interaction and shrivel and shrink with negligence. Basically, popular bubbles prosper and spread and unpopular bubbles pop and die. So these bubbles basically evolve. Now we started creating content and we have a drop tool that enables us to leave content at different locations on a map using the google maps api. But is that a good idea? Should we just create a bubble or two in everyone's bag that they find once they download the app? I hope that's a bit more specific to get some help on the topic.

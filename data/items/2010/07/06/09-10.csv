He did <i>exactly</i> that.<p>One of Derrida's most prominent students, Geoff Bennington, wrote a book (with Derrida's approval and authorization) which attempted to summarize Derrida's work for the general reader.  To make the game more interesting, he attempted to do so without directly quoting Derrida a single time.  And, just to put a nice bow on it all, Derrida read the manuscript, and wrote a piece (which is published in the same volume) outlining briefly the parts of his philosophy he thought were excluded by Bennington's summary.",1278410397

Since you are starting with a clean slate in terms of products, it will be most useful to you to ensure that the product names are kept as clean as possible, this will make it MUCH easier to integrate with a price service if you plan to monetize it that way in future.<p>3) I'm not sure what the 'revisions' button is supposed to do (not technically, I mean in terms of usefulness to the site). I was able to rollback someone else's review to a previous version.<p>4) Product lists can grow to be quite diverse and you will need a way to categorize the lists the same way that products are grouped into lists. For example, you may need an Electronics category where all PC's, cell phones and GPS's are listed. And futher on you may need to break the cell phone category into 'Smart Phones' and 'Cell Phones'. Advice for this is that if you do plan to monetize by connecting with a price service then map your categories to that of the price service because it will be easier to sync up your products later (unless they really don't match your categorization in which case you will need a way to match them up behind the scenes.)<p>5) Don't know how you would approach this one, but when I went to 'Blogs for Entrepeneurs' and clicked on 'Paul Grahams Blog' I could see that the response was positive so I would want to check out this blog. If I didn't know who Paul Graham was I would need to then google his name to find his blog. It would be nice for items like that if the person who creates the item could add some text or blurb about it. But I'm not sure how that would translate when adding an actual product that is not a blog.<p>Hope that was useful :) Good luck with it!<p>[edit: spelling]",1278410210

1490499,comment,1489867,1490306,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"OK, I'll try to do this, but honestly, I don't have the kind of time it deserves.<p>Deconstruction is, roughly speaking (and believe, me, I'm speaking schematically here) for the purposes of this discussion, the philosophy of Jacques Derrida, and his followers.  (We'll ignore, for the moment, the more literary  analysis of Paul De Man, which often go under the name of deconstruction as well.)<p>Derrida makes it very clear throughout his writings that deconstruction is not a repeatable method which can be applied to a text, but rather, an engagement with a text on its own terms.  So, there is no ""formula"" or set of steps that can be applied.<p>Second, despite the author's reduction of deconstruction to a branch of literary criticism, the texts in question are more often from the philosophical corpus than from the literary tradition.  While it's true that Derrida devotes more attention to folks like Joyce, Celan and Genet than most philosophers do, the quantity of pages he devotes to them is a tiny fragment of the time he devotes to Heidegger, Husserl and Hegel, for instance.<p>Despite the author's step-by-step breakdown, deconstruction in practice doesn't work this way.  If I were forced to generalize (and I suppose I am), I would say that deconstruction consists most often of a micrological reading (that is to say, a very close reading of the actual words of the text, not not just the broad concepts) which takes into account the (usually unconscious) assumptions that the author is working within.  Most often, these assumptions, when taken to their logical conclusion lead to either a contradiction or an aporia, and the text often reflects this, unknowingly.  So, a deconstructive reading often picks up on latent implications of the text itself.<p>I should point out that the author here is completely wrong when he writes ""Step 2 -- Decide what the text says. This can be whatever you want...."" This is egregiously incorrect.  In fact, one of Derrida's main points is that we do not decide at all what the text says.  (As an aside, <i>decidability</i> is actually a term of art within deconstruction, so the author's abuse of it here is particularly irksome.  If he had say ""figure out"" instead of ""decide"" he'd have been less wrong on several counts.)<p>To take a concrete (and much celebrated) example, Derrida's ""Plato's Pharmacy"" is a reading of Plato's <i>Phaedrus.</i>  It will make absolutely no sense to you if you haven't already read the Phaedrus closely, and are already familiar with the traditional interpretation of the text within philosophical circles.  Sorry, but that's the bar to entry.<p>Assuming that you know the Phaedrus, then: the central moment in the text (according to the standard reading) is the condemnation of writing-- you know the passage.  In the course of this, Plato (or rather Socrates, or rather, an Egyptian king in a legend recounted by Socrates recounted by  Plato) compares writing to a drug, using the Greek word ""pharmakon"".  Derrida shows that this word, like the English word ""drug"", has both a positive sense (""remedy"") and a negative sense (""poison""), and cannot be reduced to either singular meaning.  Furthermore, the oscillation between these two meanings cannot be fully controlled, but only understood through context, which is never saturated (never fully complete.)  Put simply, if you call something a drug, you can't exclude either the positive or negative meaning in the mind of the listener.  Now, at this point, Derrida then goes through the entire Platonic corpus, and quotes every time the word ""pharmakon"" or one of its cognates (""pharmikia"", etc.) is mentioned, and shows the range of meanings implied by this term for Plato, and its implications for the passage in the Phaedrus.  So far, so good.  But here comes the kicker: Derrida shows that although Plato uses a variety of related terms throughout his works, there is one cognate which is notable by its absence: ""pharmakos"", meaning ""scapegoat"".  And this ghost-reference to scapegoating seems to fit quite well with what Plato is doing with writing.<p>Now, I've trivialized Derrida's argument in at least a dozen ways in writing this-- and as I said, the above will not make any sense if you're not already steeped in the debates within the philosophical tradition about ""writing"" versus ""speech"", which are of little interest to anybody outside of the philosophical tradition.  But that's a taste of what deconstruction is like, and how it operates.<p>I'll note in passing that there is only one ""binary opposition"" that Derrida is at all interested in within his work-- ""interior"" vs ""exterior""-- and the ""speech"" vs ""writing"" discussion in Plato is a proxy for this.<p>The paper linked here make ""jive with what your eyes see"", because it was written by somebody on the outside, looking in.  And I'm sure that if I were to write an outsider's view of a discipline I knew nothing about (say, astro-physics) it  might look completely plausible to another outsider, while in reality bearing little resemblance to what actually goes on within the discipline.<p>Does that help at all?",1278409864

But in the 1500s, Sweden gained independence, and both countries adopted protestantism, which meant both countries translated the bible. And with that action the languages actually split with Danish gravitating towards how it was spoken and spelled in Copenhagen, and Swedish gravitating towards how it was spoken and spelled in Stockholm.<p>So Swedish and Danish are almost the same language, they've only been split for 500 years. But since Denmark is a more densely populated country, it means that Danish has changed <i>faster</i>. Swedish has been going through similar transformations as Danish, except slower.<p>For example, Danish has gone further in vowelshifting y to ö, compare the word for key: ""nyckel"" in Swedish, ""nøgel"" in Danish. In some Swedish dialects people say ""nöckel"", but it hasn't made it to standard Swedish.<p>Both languages have done consonant softening of g to j and k to g or ch, but Danish has also softened t to d, v to u, and p to b.<p>And the sole reason for this is that Denmark has a six times higher population density than Sweden, with roughly the same population.<p>Although the <i>other</i> theory on Danish language, namely that they've all stuffed their mouths full of potatoes before speaking, is still somewhat plausible. :-)",1278407274

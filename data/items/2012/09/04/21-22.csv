It's not clear how the $10K promise works (the official site[0] doesn't have the T&C populated yet[1]), but there's surely some time within which you must earn between $1k and $10k.  After that time, I'd guess that more purchases would still be yours.

4476735,comment,4475834,4476004,3,0,tzs,,,"I disagree that this shows mathematical illiteracy. What you've overlooked is that eating at a restaurant is, in game theory terms, a repeated game. You have to analyze it in terms of multiple plays.<p>If I go into a restaurant on some random night, and their price list tells me a steak is $25, but they also tell me they are having a discount that night and I can have the steak for $20, then they have established in my mind that a steak at that restaurant costs $25, and that sometimes they offer discounts.<p>If I go in some other random night, and am charged $25, I'm OK with that. I've planned for it. I've decided my budget can handles a $25 steak. If I happen to hit some kind of discount night, great. I save some money.<p>Suppose instead the first time they charged me $20, but did not tell me that was some kind of discount. I see $20 printed on the menu, and no indication that the price is higher at other times. That sets in my mind that a steak at this place is $20. I expect now to be able to go in any time and get a steak for $20.<p>I then go in another random night, and it is $25. Now I'm not OK. I had planned on $20. They've stuck me with an extra $5 that I had not budgeted for. No I can't have popcorn at the movie I'm going to afterward. :-(<p>What it comes down to is that people want the ""normal"" price to be the highest price that the place charges. They can then plan for that, and if they happen to hit a sale, then they get a windfall. Windfalls don't screw up budgets. They are surprises--but they are pleasant surprises.<p>When the ""normal"" price is not the highest price, people get surprises, but not the pleasant kind.<p>When I go out to eat, I do not want unpleasant surprises. Hence it is more acceptable to me for restaurants to offer discounts on non-busy nights rather the surcharges on busy night. The former only gives me pleasant surprises, the latter only unpleasant surprises.",1346795385

Well in the tarsnap case it appears to be a block which as far as glacier is concerned it probably thinks it is a file.<p>[ NB: huge huge guesses here about how tarsnap works ]<p>Now consider de-dupe in blocks (vs de-dupe in files) with an object store, combined with a backup. Now lets say you have a file that is 5 'blocks' long. You can get the original 5 blocks (5x fetches) then each block where deltas reside, to recreate the file you want at the time you want it.<p>Compare that to the 'stupid' way of doing it which is to store a full image of the file system for each time period. Where you have one fetch to get back the file from the copy of the file system that you were interested in.<p>But this is where the assumptions that make that stupid need to be evaluated. It is a poor choice because the expensive thing is the storage, and you trade compute cycles for storage. That is normally a winning idea because you only 'spend' the compute cycles when you reconstruct the file you want, but you continually pay for storage month after month.<p>Except that the pricing model of Glacier makes bulk storage cheaper and algorithmic reconstruction expensive.<p>Presumably the folks at Amazon are de-duping, after all they get to charge per the GB and if they can sell that exact same GB to two people, well that is a win!<p>So back to the question at hand.<p>Lets say your middleware layer is just like it is today, figures out just the deltas in your file system from the last backup and then pushes those. You've got a file system image plus a delta image and by applying the delta to the full image you can get back to the current image. However, since storage is now less expensive than compute, <i>at the Amazon instance</i> you take the delta apply it to the latest full backup, and create a new full backup which you then store in Glacier.<p>So can this possibly make sense? That is the question, if you keep full copies of the latest copy of every file, and pointers to the reconstructed previous versions in your S3 meta data. Can you get a lower net cost for the service implementation?",1346794980

There were keywords where you could see only 7 organic results.<p>The rest was AdWords.<p>To make things worse, Google adds more and more ""product search"" results (paid placement).<p>With each day, there's less and less traffic for those people who don't pay Google. I suspect that the paid placement trend will increase until it is possible.<p>To make things worse, Google not only decreases the SERP ""real estate"". They also introduce frequent algorithm updates which tend to drop down websites which earn on search-engine traffic. Leaving those which may have lesser quality but don't earn on their traffic ( no monetization ). And if you do it to a million websites, you will gain quite a lot of new AdWords buyers. Some of them have to try your PPC ads. Let's say that 10% of them will try to get traffic out of PPC - now you've got yourself 100.000 paying customers.<p>It's obvious they want to force people both to buy and to click ads. They don't gain anything by sending free traffic to other affiliate websites ( which will then convert to sales/leads ).<p>The question is: Where do you draw a line between a search engine and an ""ad engine""?<p>To many people, especially those less tech-savy, Google = Internet.<p>I personally think, it's pretty bad for the overall state of e-economy to have this one big mogul who administers the majority of targetted traffic. He wants his share of the pie from everyone. If you are too small to pay, fuck you. They don't need you. The consumer won't notice you are not in the search results, there are 50 other websites happy to take your place. Either you are at the top or you don't exist.<p>It'd be great if there would be something like Google but with a more ""socialistic"" approach. Instead of having a few websites occupying the top place, provide the traffic to other, smaller players. So the e-economy can expand more.",1346794972

No, just have your QA person file the ticket as a bug (with the correct priority) and have your developers pull tickets off your bug tracker themselves.

Add in a few minutes of another developer's time to code review the first developer (you don't even do <i>that</i> despite having all that process?) and it's still cheaper.<p>Unit tests? Developers write their own unit tests. Have a failing unit test that reproduces the root cause of the bug <i>before</i> you fix the bug--that's a best practice anyway.

4476577,comment,4475650,4476241,1,0,wtvanhest,,,"By broad point was not really clear, but could simply be stated as:<p>We will make a lot of assumptions about what is a linear expense, linear threat etc. without really knowing what will be linear until we pack an extremely tight grouping of cars on the road.<p>Taking my point further:<p>For road work, expense may go from linear to nonlinear because of something that seems completely counterintuitive.  Imagine every car now has variation in the exact placement within the lanes.  Highways have marks where the majority of cars drive, but variation in drivers accounts for variation in path.  If every robot executed their driving in the exact 1 foot per tire space, it is likely that 1 foot per tire space would require a greater than linear road work.  This could be solved by programing an automatic variation in all cars or possibly changing how roads are built so that they require only cement in those 1 foot areas.<p>Now, an example of a time when engineers thought they had it right, but didnt think of everything:<p>Engineering has come a long way since the Tacoma bridge incedent, but we cannot underestimate what assumptions were previously made that will be incorrect when we start driving far more vehicles on roads.  In the Tacoma bridge edge case, sustained winds caused flutter (self-feeding vibration) which caused the bridge to fail.<p>While I do not suggest this is a likely case, the fact is, we are probably not considering everything and there will be issues we do not foresee, but we should try to eliminate as many edge cases as possible.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)</a><p>To your point about robots being faster:  Yes, I agree they are faster, but even the fastest robot will need some space to interact.  In a situation where a truck on the highway has a blowout which causes large debris to separate from the truck, the robots still need some room to slow down.  In the extreme example where cars are 1 foot away from each other, an accident like that would have tremendous negative consequences that even robots would have a tough time dealing with.<p>We will have self-driving cars, and they will likely be much safer than human operated cars, but we are going to also have setbacks and many of them can be avoided by looking to the future and trying to solve the problems early rather than later.",1346793326

4476509,comment,4474724,4475997,1,0,wpietri,,,"I disagree specifically, and also with your interpretation of his point.<p>Embracing the pain of exercise absolutely does reduce the pain. If you don't exercise for months, it hurts like hell to get started again. The natural reaction, especially for people who have never exercised, is to avoid the pain and stop. But if you are returning to exercise after, say, an illness, you will slowly work through the pain until your body responds. There is still some underlying pain, but it is much less for a person who's in shape.<p>But I don't think he's making the direct analogy you're seeing. I think his broad point is exactly what the title says, that one should lean into the pain in many aspects of life. Exercise and software development are just two examples of applying the principle.",1346792538

4476503,comment,4476457,4476457,1,0,mindcrime,,,"I just started[1] a little exercise/experiment where I'm trying to come up with 10 new ideas each day, for the next 6 months.  I'm 3 days in (well, today is day 4, but I haven't done the exercise yet today), so nothing I have to say necessarily means much, but here are some observations I have so far:<p>1. Sit down with a blank piece of paper (or an OOo doc, whatever) and type:<p>1)<p>and then think until something comes to mind.  Maybe the first idea that comes to mind seems stupid.  Fine, put it in the mental ""bin"" and move on.  You may find that later, a different idea merges with part of that ""binned"" idea, and something emerges.<p>2. Read a lot, and not just the typical startup stuff.  Grab the latest issues of Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, Discover, New Scientist, Scientific American, American Scientist, or whatever.  Also, read magazines / blogs / whatever related to either a hobby you're into, or an industry you're interested in, or both.  When you do your brainstorming exercise, try to find a way to spin an idea out of something you recently discovered / read / came across.<p>3. Look around the room you're in, and take the first thing you see and try to come up with an idea around that.  If no idea is forthcoming, look for a second ""thing"" and then try to combine the two.  So, if you see a book, think of an idea related to books.  If you don't come up with anything, look around, and maybe you see a vacuum cleaner.  And <i>bingo</i> you come up with the idea for a clip on book holder for vacuum cleaners!  (OK, that's probably a rubbish idea, but not every idea is going to be a good one)<p>4. ""Borrow brilliance.""  Or, to use the old quote ""Good artists copy, great artists steal"" or whatever.  Spend lots of time hanging out with smart people and bat ideas around over coffee or whatever.<p>5. Try to think up two seemingly unrelated things and then find a way to merge them in some fashion.<p>6. Think about problems you have in your own life, and try to come up with a solution.<p>7. Go with the Jamie Zawinski thing about ""if you want to make money with software, find a way to help some guy in his dorm room get laid.""<p>8. etc...<p>[1]: <a href=""http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2012/09/project-10-ideas-day-for-6-months.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2012/09/project-10-ideas-day-for...</a>",1346792432

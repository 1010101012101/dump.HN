One researcher told me around 1980 that Kansas wheat farmers will have some lung diseases from that occupation, but they stay relatively cancer free.  Whereas jogging in the Boston urban area was none too good for your lungs.<p>Radon.  The initial study that got everyone upset about it (note that it's no longer a ""big"" thing) was based on uranium miners.  Who got not only a big radon dose but who were mostly heavy smokers.<p>I forget if birth control pills + smoking = cancer, but as I recall the combination of the two is rather unhealthy.<p>Anyway, the point here is that tobacco smoking may be more of a cancer promotion cause than a cause per se.

1800194,comment,1798032,1798640,0,0,lsc,,,"Now, personally, I agree all this is irrational exuberance.  But, I don't see it as a huge problem.  As far as that goes, I'm not sure the first .com bubble and crash was really a bad thing for the industry.  (the first .com bubble and crash were <i>very good</i> for me personally, even though they were clearly mis-allocations of capital from a societal viewpoint.)  Huge amounts of infrastructure (software and hardware) was constructed.   Many new Engineers were attracted and trained.  (of course, it was bad for those who didn't make the cut during the crash, but it was probably quite good for the industry as a whole)<p>Sure, some speculators are going to get soaked... but that's what happens when a speculator is wrong.  I don't see that as a bad thing.  Capitalism is based on this idea that speculation is fine;  it's just that if you are wrong too many times, well, you can't speculate any more because you don't have any more money.<p>I know that I personally am rather jealous of Zuckburg.  I don't feel he ""deserves"" to be that rich, but eh, that's not mine to decide.  He certainly has more of a claim to that money than the CEO of Enron or GM, you know?<p>Sure, we're mis-allocating a lot of capital.  But you know?  the capital is coming from rich speculators, I believe, as it's so goddamn difficult to IPO these days, and a bunch of it is being used to prop up Engineer salaries, so while I recognize that it's an inefficient mis-allocation of capital, it's a wealth redistribution over which I certainly won't shed any tears.<p>Personally, I think this wealth redistribution from speculators to Engineers will continue this trend towards more realistic and more efficient Internet businesses, as more of the speculators are replaced by Engineers who made it big in the last boom.  This is, after all, how we got Paul Graham and Ycombinator.",1287319162

Unfortunately much of the world is credential-based (especially Asian parents...), so being able to award a degree would make a difference in who could participate.  Plus, if someone's startup fails, or he just realizes he'd rather do something other than startups, the credential makes getting a regular job much easier, preserving options.  And of course immigration often depends on a degree, and using educational visas to get people into the USA in the first place would be a great hack.<p>I think a 5-6 year program to get a SB in tech entrepreneurship, where 1-2 years are spent doing smaller projects and some regular classes (as applied to those projects), and then 4 years in a co-op program with your startup and students from the first 1-2 years, would be ideal.

I don't particularly care about what Wikipedia says, since <i>I was there</i> for the Gosling->GNU version and learned the TECO/PDP-10/20 story from eyewitnesses; the Wikipedia version gives a bit too much very early emphasis to Stallman for the latter.<p>Many people contributed to TECO macros, to the point where there were three or more major versions and people had the problem of not being able to necessarily sit down at a colleague's terminal and type into their editor.<p>Guy Steele spend a week or so obtaining order out of chaos (biggest issue was negotiating the common key bindings, something I assure you RMS is not diplomatic enough to do :-)  and near the end of this Stallman joined and then took over the project and most especially its leadership.  For Steele this was just a problem to be solved and once it was in good hands he had other fish to fry (e.g. Scheme).<p>Another semi-correction to Wikipedia is that there were one or more ersatz UNIX EMACS versions floating around before Goslings' (ersatz by RMS's terminology; they had the basic command set and key bindings but if you needed to change or add anything you had to dive into the C code.  This was a necessary limitation for running on the PDP-11 with its severe 64K of code and 56K of data limits).  There was also a serious 32 bit version built on top of ex as I remember, but it stayed commercial and therefore died.<p>My ""not any version of it"" refers to your ""As far as I understand, the guy made Emacs ... practically alone initially.""  Which to me implies that he started the projects or at least was an initial team member, which was not true for either the TECO or 32 UNIX versions.  Instead, he took over existing healthy versions and made them much better.  By the time I showed up on the scene, he was emphasizing self-documentation and extensibility, the latter of which was by and large never offered except through a LISP.  (Perhaps a bit pedantic, but I'm a scientist by training so getting attributions of this sort correct is important to me.)<p>SINE may be an early exception since it was a custom LISP like language for building its EMACS, but its community was so small (the Media Lab precursor) I'd doubt any normal mortals played with it.  Whereas Bernie Greenberg was intensely proud about how he managed to make MULTICS EMACS so accessible that MIT secretaries were doing their own extensions, generally started from a key sequence capture.<p>Bernie was big on ""LISP for the masses"" (along with a number of others in this period); as I recall, he was the author of a very good medium length (less than 100 pages) general introduction to the language, <i>Notes on the programming language LISP</i> and frequently taught a course during January based on it (""LISP is is for 'interesting' programs, as opposed to, say, accounts receivable.""

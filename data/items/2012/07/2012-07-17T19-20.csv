By ""this route"" I just ment creating independent isolated environments for the various runtime to operate within. Based on comments made on the GAE mailing list, I suspect they have moved in this direction.

I put off surgery as long as possible due to a high risk of complications that could lead to total blindness. By the time I was ready to have the surgery, I couldn't see to do a lot of everyday things, like cook, watch TV, etc. and had a lot of colorblindness and diplopia (sometimes seeing as many as 8 'ghost' images when looking at an object).<p>The sudden improvement in my vision after cataract surgery took probably two weeks to fully adjust to, mentally. I actually had a bit of paranoia for a while, because I would see things in my vision that I wasn't used to seeing and it would trigger some sort of panic response. I hadn't been totally blind prior to the operation, but suddenly there was all of this detail that hadn't been there before (or that I hadn't seen in months, anyway).<p>I'd look at something and it was blue or had texture or cast a shadow. It made it very hard to concentrate. Everything was a distraction.<p>I remember that I had a mild panic attack one day shortly after surgery when we stopped for lunch. We were seated next to a window in the restaurant and it was very windy and cloudy outside. The wind blowing the clouds around was causing shifts in lighting coming in through the window and it was just too much sensory input for me to handle.",1342554788

If you were born in France, you become French at the age of 18 (automatically, no question asked) if you have lived at least 5 years (no need to continuity) in France since you're 11 (21-7 Code civil). And you can renounce to your french nationality in the 12 months after the automatic acquisition (until your 19 or the moment at which you join the military).

I even used some of his teachings later with my little brother when he got into development.<p>My mentor, Philip, did several of the things that you mentioned you wish had been done when you were starting out. For instance, whenever I programmed something that was good he gave me encouragement and praised me for it, but then only on the things I programmed that really were good which made me respect his opinion. He gave me tasks that were almost always a little bit out of my reach in terms of my abilities but let me know that anytime I needed help he was there.<p>I would say overall, he was great for the following reasons:<p>1. He gave advice willingly but not with an overkill, mostly only when I asked for it, but every now and then he say 'hey, you wanna learn how to manage linux users, or tighten up apache security',<p>2. He was a really good programmer so he always had my respect.<p>3. He let me handle problems on my own and had faith in me, letting me always know he was there if there was anything I couldn't handle.<p>4. He had great advice in general for example:<p>he considered the best programmers to be ""lazy"" programmers because they would take their time - not start coding immediatly - think through the task and its solution, and only then begin programming with the goal being to solve the problem in the easiest way possible i.e. so that future imports to a database could be called from a simple shell script requiring the programmer to just hit enter.<p>Another great one was when he told me about two types of workers. Type A he said is someone who you send to find out what's wrong with a crashed server, he goes out comes back and tells you. Type B he said is someone who you send to find out what's wrong with the server, he comes back tells you what was wrong with it, how he repaired it and any other pertenant information.<p>I hope this helps you a little bit, its been fun reminising about the good 'ol days back when and I hope it works out well for you and the new guy!",1342554274

What I can tell you is some things I've seen and things that really helped me out a lot.<p>My mentor was incredibly keen on knowing <i>why</i> you do something. I've seen many new developers come in, and they were taught that X is the best way to do something in college or from a blog or what have you, but they've never really understood why. So, when you introduce some new condition (let's say compliance), and you can't do X (or X is now remarkably costly), then what do you do? The best way to do this is to do code reviews, and have him walk you through it. Take that time to suggest better approaches, understand his thought process, and evaluate whether or not he understands what he did.<p>Code reviews take time, but it's the best way for you and him to get on the same page and understand each other. Don't approach it from a, ""I'm an expert, and I'm going to show you up"" context. Approach it as a learning exercise where he can learn from your experience, and you can learn more about how he works.<p>Another thing my mentor did was took me with him to meetings where we reviewed the code. Getting to know your users and understand who you're doing this for is incredibly important. So many organizations try to abstract them away. It was something that put a face to the end user, and gave the user confidence in us to understand what they needed. I've seen a lot of folks not have that opportunity, and want to build ivory tower software without ever talking to a user. It also makes the job much more rewarding.<p>Anyway, those are just a couple of ideas. YMMV. Best of luck--though, if you're asking questions like this, I'm sure you'll be just fine.",1342553409

You realize that your line of argument is the <i>exact</i> one that comes up inevitably when we talk about other crimes like rape.<p>When we're talking about certain classes of crimes, most commonly any type of physical assault, excusing the perpetrators in <i>any</i> way is tacit victim-blaming. I realize you seem to think differently, but this is the way you are <i>guaranteed</i> to come across.<p>There <i>are</i> no ""buts"" when it comes to physical assault, the perpetrator is in the wrong, full stop. What the victim <i>could</i> have potentially done to prevent the attack is not relevant to the discussion, and people are allergic to this line of reasoning for good reason: 95% of the time when it comes up it's victim-blaming and shifting responsibility away from the criminal.<p>I'd argue your specific instance of this argument falls into this 95%. In response to ""a man was assaulted"" you go on about how big of a dork he is, how inconsiderate he is (simply for wearing a strange contraption!), how when a person behaves strangely bad things will happen <i>and rightly so</i>.<p>How else do you want us to interpret your comments except to draw blame away from the perps?<p>> <i>""What the hell is wrong with HIM?""</i><p>Nothing.

The number of 'cheap' HDMI video monitors out there is pretty astonishing too. You can do HDMI->DVI (this is just a plug change not a signaling change) and use many of those same monitors.<p>The challenge of course is that programming the video is dependent on getting support from Broadcom. One thing that has really pissed me off at them is I've got an InPulse watch that I can't get 64 bit Broadcom drivers for Win7 to use their SDK, how sucky is that?

There were several intelligence experts who signed a different document[1].

[3] While that doesn't mean he is wrong, one should not limit your reading of the field to the likes of Turkheimer; one would do well to read some of the prominent 'opposition' such as Linda Gottfredson and Arthur Jensen. Jensen, by the way, is considered the most eminent living man in the field, and he favors the hereditarian viewpoint.  Not that science should be done by consensus or a raising of hands, but it's handy to know what is and isn't considered tenable by modern researchers. There's more disagreement in the field than the linked post lets on.<p>In the third link below, the Cato Institute held a discussion between the 'environmentalists' Ceci, Flynn and Turkheimer, and the hereditarian Linda Gottfredson.

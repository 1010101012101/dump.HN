It is quite easy to show, by pulling data from any online stock site and creating a histogram, that stock prices do not follow a normal distribution (instead they are power laws). If stock options followed a normal distribution, 'crashes' such as last year should basically never occur.<p>Simple models also assume independent variables, because dealing with cross-correlations for thousands of stocks is hard. This is a mathematical statement of the 'common sense' expectation that you loose a little, win a little.

657457,comment,657401,657401,0,0,russell,,,"The article posits that certain parts of our societal ecosystem are getting so complex that failure has catastrophic consequences and gives two examples: power grid failures and failure of the financial system.  It goes on to propose that if something is too big to fail, break it up.  to wit, enforce antitrust when something is too big to fail.  While antitrust and limiting size is part of the arsenal of solutions, it is incomplete.<p>It is not a solution to eliminate complexity.  The electrical grid is an example as is the financial system.  If we pave over New Mexico to generate green solar power, we need a complex electrical grid to deliver the power to the users, otherwise we all have to move to New Mexico.  The power grid problem is a need for redundancy.  Parts will always fail.  We need to have enough redundant capacity to route the power around the failed component.  The Internet is robust because it has lots of redundant switching capacity.<p>The financial system is a different animal.  Its problem is not one of single point of failure, typical of physical systems, but one of systemic failure, algorithmic failure.  It all breaks in the same way because everyone is using the same algorithm, whether it be everyone invests in real estate using the greater fool theory, or everyone uses the same risk management model, or everyone writes derivatives without enough reserve.  The savings and loan crisis of the 80's wasnt the failure of a few big players, it was the failure of lots of local players.  Back to engineering, these are failures of positive feedback loops.  What is needed is negative feedback, something that pushes back in the opposite direction.  In the case of derivatives, a reserve requirement is a negative feedback.<p>I think the financial system also needs the equivalent of the CDC to watch for viral memes.  The South American loan defaults, the savings and loan crisis, the near failure of Lehman Brothers in the 80's all should have vaccine against over speculation among the financial community.  It didnt.  Instead we got Alan Greenspan.",1245008004

657433,comment,657119,657119,0,0,Maro,,,"Here in eastern Europe, university is somewhat different then in the anglo-saxon world. We don't have homework problems (homeworks are never part of the final grade), and exams at the end of the semester are usually oral where the student has to prove theorems/algorithms or in general present some kind of theoretical framework. There is usually a problem-solving exam mid-year, but it only makes up 0-25% of the grade. It's usually managable to pass the problem-solving exam, the real <i>Suck</i> is the oral examination at the end when you're face-to-face with the professor.<p>As a result of this skew toward the theoretical side, our textbooks are light on problems and practicalities and full of theories, proofs, derivations, etc. (Even a Calculus 101 textbook.) They look more like upper-level textbooks in the anglo-saxon world. As a result,  these ""textbooks"" are usually kept around for later reference.<p>This is currently changing with the introduction of the so-called 'Bologna process', which basically transforms our systems to more closely match the anglo-saxon world for compatibility reasons. Eg. before we only had 5 year MSc degrees, now we introduced the 3+2 Bsc/Msc system, which is a Good Thing.<p>Just because a (text)book is kept around for later reference doesn't mean it should be printed, as an electronic version is actually more searchable. The main obstacle is the 'reading off an LCD screen sucks sitting at the desk' issue, which once solved with a good DRM-free paper-like device will do to the Book Industry what MP3 has done to the Music Industry.<p>Already you can torrent almost any book, even ones that only interest a handful of people in the world, such as research-level physics books (example from my field: search for 'darksiderg cosmology'). The fact that these highly specialized books are torrented a few months after their publication date is pretty puzzling to me =) But I don't complain, as I can preview before I buy (we don't have bookstores selling english-language books, so checking them out at the bookstore is not an option). But once people can copy these to a book-like device, publishers will have to look for another revenue stream. Fortunately, with research-level books, the answer in theory at least is pretty simple: just cut out the publisher, researchers already generate print-ready Latex files anyways. In reality it will be a long struggle; a good use-case is research journals where the publisher is completely unnecessary but is still holding on, researchers are still signing over publication rights of their papers to companies like Springer.",1245006464

My opinion is no - the sweat <i>is</i> the learning.  Skipping the problems would just lead to knowing a lot <i>about</i> math, without actually knowing any math.<p>On the other hand, it's tempting - and in the Real World (tm), people do just plug their giant, buck-nasty equations into Mathematica and avoid doing all the book-keeping.<p>I guess the question is: should pilots all just train on auto-pilot, while having only a conceptual understanding of what piloting is about? Or should they learn to pilot manually first, and then use the auto-pilot judiciously? There are legitimate points going both ways - but I vote for the 2nd.",1245006357

Well then we'd pull out its power plug.</i><p>I was just posing an interesting question, especially as regards to the whole notion of ""superior"" intelligence.  Superior in what regards?  By whose measure?  Eliezer should be given credit for promoting an information theoretic approach to that question.  At least that seems to be a fundamental measure with a good chance of escaping cultural biases concerning ""intelligence.""<p>I am certainly not in some simpleminded <i>superior AI is going to kill us all</i> camp.  Perhaps we will have very powerful AI optimization tools that have no sense of self, or self-originating volition whatsoever.  There would be no reason for such entities to act in their own self interest, and therefore no danger for their interests to conflict with our own.  They would have the disadvantage, though, of never coming up with something neat on their own initiative.  I think there's enough more than enough initiative from human sources.  What's needed is better optimization.<p>(Of course, only one rogue self-directed AI entity escaping into the wild could <i>possibly</i> -- not certainly -- doom us all.  But this is not a new kind of danger.  We have been facing that sort of danger -- where one robust and virulent enough example could escape and wreak havoc -- from technologies based on molecular biology for a few years now.  So far, so good.)",1245006213

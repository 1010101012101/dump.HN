So in other words, your market is _exactly_ people like me who aren't completely immersed in GIS but make use of some simple mapping and GIS scripting from time to time.<p>And for people like me, $10 is asking to much - especially when we can piece together a few odds and ends and come up with a little script or an ugly conversion tool that does the job.<p>So, what is the perfect price point? You'll have to play around, but I guess at least a quarter of that would make it worthwhile. In fact, I would aim for something around the $1 mark - but that's up to you.<p>I'd suggest taking a look at the ocrterminal.com model.

It's fascinating to see that it is only now we are (in a sense) re-innovating their invention.<p>If you get chance to read up on the Wrights it is worth it; they were simply brilliant hackers. They were smart and creative, and had no concerns about disagreeing with established theory if they thought it was wrong (in fact going to great lengths to correct theories).<p>My favourite ""story"" about them, though, is that the propeller was an after thought - they spent so long perfecting the wings, flight control and the engine and had assumed a normal boat propeller would work.

For example, if price was the sticking point, the common approach would be to hide the price while you sell the product so as not to scare people off while you're winning them over. The disqualification marketing technique would be to put that scary price right in the ad text, the idea being that those who click are not going to be scared off by the price, as they already know it.<p>This can do wonders in effectively multiplying your adwords spending - all those people who were never going to buy at that price stop using up your ad budget, leaving you more ad clicks for those who might buy despite the price.",1285763760

I think that, given some assumptions, you can model the universe as an infinite numerical sequence, so you should see all finite events.<p>However, the assumptions here seem tricky. Uniform distribution of probability seems unlikely, and if the universe is anything like the game of life, there are garden of Eden states with no predecessor state, which an evolving system cannot reach, even in infinite time.<p>Cardinality is indeed tricky. I had thought that all finite sequences would be greater than aleph-null, but apparently it isn't.",1285762209

1739056,comment,1709213,1723921,0,0,Gormo,,,"Roads and currency?  I suppose we could get into a detailed conversation about how well decentralized, voluntary forms of organization could create and sustain these - I'd suggest that they could, and often do - but for the sake of argument, I'll concede the point.  Roads are slabs of pavement in the ground; currency are tokens used as a means of exchange.  These are pretty mundane things, hardly the wellspring of society, and I do hope you'd agree that roads, currency, and other similar goods are consequences of, and not prerequisites for, a well-functioning society.<p>The question of contract enforcement is more interesting.  I would entirely agree that law is a necessary mechanism, without which the few 'bad apples' in society would spoil the rest.  But I think it's important to note that if breaches of contract - that is, failure of people to maintain their voluntary arrangements in good faith - were the general case rather than outliers, no amount of law could prevent society from failing.  The <i>judicial</i> process is a tool we can use as a fallback solution to protect those arrangements we freely create with others.  But it should be clearly distinguished from the <i>regulatory</i> mentality which seeks to prescriptively define those relationships in advance, and compel adherence to a set of prepackaged social models without specific regard to the preferences and expectations of the individuals in each case.  The regulatory model designs the overarching system around the outlier failure conditions rather than permitting the flexibility that optimizes the general case.  Law is appropriately the brake pedal, not the gas.<p>I'd disagree with your perceptions of America as being particularly disconnected and paranoid - Americans are stereotypically confident and optimistic - although I think that individualism and cultural pluralism in America might often lead to more paranoia about social policies that seek <i>universal</i> solutions to complex problems.  There may be a reason why the social democratic model seems to work most effectively in the cultures where 'Jante law' is most evident.",1285762042

At my place of work, the designers have standardized on using them for many sites for a year or so now, and we have been sick of them for about that long. There was a study a few years ago that showed that people are fascinated with faces and like photos on sites. But when the site designer can't decide on a single photo to best convey the myriad of ideas they are trying to relate on the page, they rotate them with a way to navigate between them using the same ""carousel"" pattern.<p>Interaction on a page is good, but when you start making decisions about what they user should see next (e.g. like the the fading in and out of news headlines that used to be on news sites in the early 2000s), you may as well just show video or some fancy animation, because the user is getting distracted rather than seeing the static content they typically want to see. Slideshows that can be set to automate via ""play slideshow"" are just fine, though.",1285761894

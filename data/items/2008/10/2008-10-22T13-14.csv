340011,comment,339661,339969,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"I think it's considered unhealthy because it's another layer of complexity you have to deal with, and a many-branched environment without any system-enforced meta-structure can result in huge amounts of confusion when things don't go right. You have to train your team and trust everyone to avoid all human error. Example: ""whoops, I just merged a bad branch into the master one, but I just left work for the day and I don't find this out until tomorrow morning, let's hope no one checked it out in the interim or we're boned!""<p>With a centralized VCS (or more specifically a single- or few-branched repo), you just tell people to checkout code, commit their changes, and you're done. There are less places to screw up because you don't have a bunch of branches you have to manage. You are less flexible, but this lack of flexibility only becomes a huge burden in a truly distributed (i.e. open source) environment.<p>It's sort of like arguing static vs. dynamic typing. There are many cases where dynamic typing resulted in very painful errors because some variable along the line didn't follow the ""gentleman's agreement"" that it should be a list and not a string. Though dynamic typing is more flexible and powerful, sometimes you just succumb to human error because the computer trusts you.",1224683423

340008,comment,339594,339759,0,0,cabalamat,,,"Unfortunately it's the combination of new technologies and existing attitudes that are the problem. For example, if you ask the average politician what's an acceptable level of crime, he'll say ""none"". The average member of the public will say the same. But the only way to achieve this is with omnipresent surveillance. Every electronic conversation will be monitored, there'll be a surveillance camera on every street corner (there's already 1 for every 15 people), people's movements will be tracked using their mobile phone. All cars will have tracker devices, ostensibly for road pricing, but all movements will be logged. Everyone will be forced to carry an RFID-enabled ID card.<p>All this technology will be sold to the public as protection against terrorists and pedophiles, but will eventually be used against everyone. (For example, local councils have used terrorist legislation to snoop on householders who have allegedly not been putting their rubbish out correctly.)<p>If it becomes possible to use brain scanners to read people's minds, this will be done too. To start with, to check for terrorists, but later to enforce conformity of thought on the entire population -- for their own good of course. For example, it's illegal not to employ someonre because of their race. Fair enough, you might say. But if a small business owner is a racist they can easily get around this by not employing people they don't want to (they have to be careful not to tell them it's for racial reasons, of course). Now a well-meaning but dim person could suggest that we check that someone wasn't refused employment for racial reasons, by scanning the brain of the employer. So eventually, anyone who thinks for themselves and doesn't just get into the habit of unthinkingly going along with the prevailing intellectual fashions of the day will find themselves in trouble.<p>All this will happen unless the political climate changes and people accept that tolerating a certain level of crime is better than an omnipresent totalitarian state breathing down their neck all the time.",1224683337

One reason is that, oftentimes, failure is a big amorphous mess. If all the employees agreed on what the problem was, they might have been able to do something about it before it killed the company. :)<p>(By contrast, it's easy to explain a successful company's success: Just look at where the money is coming from.)<p>Moreover, it's in nobody's best interest to call attention to their own bad decisions, and it's even less wise to poke fun at the bad decisions of your coworkers, who may be a vital part of the personal network that will keep you alive after the startup explodes.<p>The entire point of this Techcrunch article is that doing post-mortem work on a startup is a thankless task. No matter what you say, you will be treated like an assassin. Look closely at your complaint:<p><i>Most coverage I read comes across as mockery, as to suggest that the concept or group could never have succeeded in the first place.</i><p>You call that ""mockery"", but isn't that the <i>polite</i> alternative?

You can adopt git and get a bunch of its features (local repository mirrors and multiple local branches) while still working atop your SVN repository. You give up some things (you can't really do cross-repository merges with git-svn -- when you want to communicate with your peers you have to do it via the SVN repo) but it is still great. It's not worth waiting another five years for the extra features. ;)<p>I've found that the CVS-to-git workflow is a bit more annoying.

Ignoring for the moment problems which are social at their root and not a dvcs' fault, most likely either you're creating lots of dead ends in those branches, which isn't such a bad thing because it also means that you're also trying out lots of ideas and exploring the problem space; or you're merging those branches, so you're doing good work and getting it integrated into the project.",1224680633

You could either formalize it in a bunch of headers and try to synthesize the structure of it or you can use tricks like this in order to parse it nicely.<p>In graphics programming, or more specifically, file format programming, sometimes I have to parse through, or generate a colortable and then go through a bunch of serialized data and transform that into a buffer where I have something like coordinate[x][y]{[z]}.{rgb/cmyk/yuv/hsv/rgba/bgr...} and I have a bunch of unions and structs; having char * data[3] as my payload and then being able to offset around into it is fantastically convenient, especially when trying to apply kernels or do transformations over the entire space.<p>The code is far more readable at the lower level manipulation with this kind of stuff.<p>And when you say 'Well I use OTS solutions for graphics' and I say ""I do too, when I can.

3127359,comment,3127185,3127265,16,0,beforebeta,,,"The linked video (in german) explains this. Apparently Facebook has a registered HQ in Ireland (presumably - as someone mentioned in another thread - for tax purposes). Since it is a registered business in Ireland, it is subject to all Irish and many applicable European laws (one of which is data privacy). The 24-year-old Individual feels it's against his data privacy rights that Facebook retains deleted messages.<p>Personally I find his arguments a bit flawed - e.g. in one instance apparently he objects to the fact that Facebook knows when he was ill because he can do a quick CTRL-F on the text ""ill"" (german: krank) in the text he received from Facebook. My question is - isn't he the one who posted that content in the first place?<p>Secondly, he complains that deleted messages are still retained by Facebook. Could that just be a referential integrity constraint - since most messages require 2 or more parties. Therefore, although he deletes the messages, the other party still has the message in their inbox. Therefore, Facebook cannot simply delete the message. Furthermore, since the message has him linked, even if he deletes it from his side, Facebook needs to retain that information on their side.<p>You know the best solution to protect yourself from Facebook's data privacy policies - get off Facebook or at least be cautious when you post! I personally love the service and think one should be smart about what they post on publicly accessible social networks since that data remains for eternity!",1318974358

What makes currencies valuable, and what makes things valuable in general, is that people want them. People want the government not to smash their doors down and haul them away and put them in jail, or freeze their assets, etc. The rest of the value of a dollar recursively emanates out from that. There's a value to having a dollar beyond just the goods and services that can be obtained, it prevents Uncle Sam from destroying you. There's no value to a BitCoin; the base case of BitCoin is ""zero"", unlike a dollar or any other government fiat currency, unlike gold (which has industrial and decorative uses which may not stay constant but won't drop to zero for a long time), unlike anything else called a ""currency"".

She's learned a lot of spoken vocabulary from it, and appears to be in the 99th percentile for language development.  She doesn't typically sign anything (except for milk) but the other day I asked her what the sign is for a few things and she actually seems to know them.<p>There is no way to tell for certain, but I credit the signing time videos with giving her a very clear sense of core (verbal and signed) language symbolism. The repetition of words, signs, and pictures has always seemed quite interesting to her, with the less familiar, more abstract words/concepts initially seeming a bit less interesting and subsequently gaining significance as her overall awareness improved.<p>I have noticed on the few occasions when we've had a movie or show on the TV when she's been around that she'll initially pay close attention to it and then after a minute or two begin to stare blankly at it... this is quite the opposite reaction she has to the signing time videos.<p>So to summarize I'm skeptical that it makes sense to generalize too much about the specific age ranges when kids are ""ready"" for various stimuli. I think that metaphor is stretched too far. Instead, a child will find certain stimuli intensely interesting (including some stuff that may be on a TV).  To the extent that the child can conceptualize the structure of the stimulus enough to provoke learning, the stimulus can be considered ""good"" or beneficial to learning.  But the developing brain will also get overwhelmed, so after a certain point even a good stimulus becomes noise and can only lead the child to exert effort to tune it out, which would use up cognitive effort for something without any learning benefit.",1318973244

It's also relatively expensive from what I remember. It doesn't seem like the most cost effective way to improve your focus/performance.<p>I agree with gcheong, exercise is a good way to maintain focus. In fact, doing something difficult (and hopefully productive) on a daily basis is a great way to increase your personal discipline, which leads to more focus. Try to force yourself to exercise, read or do anything that you don't generally want to do every day. The confidence and work ethic you build could translate into improved studying and focus.

Concentration, like any skill, needs to be practiced.  To practice concentration and focus, do only one thing at a time.<p>When eating, focus on your meal and turn off the computer; when driving, focus on the road and turn off the car radio. Anything you find yourself doing, try to do that and eliminate all distractions (sometimes this is impossible).<p>Your body should also be in a healthy state, thus exercise is of the utmost importance, 2-3 times a day for 45 mins seems to do it for me.<p>The food you eat and substances you consume have tremendous impacts on your mental state.  Avoid meat, alcohol, cigarettes, pungent and spicy foods.  Eat mild, bland foods and you'll begin to notice a clarity of mind and increased ability to focus.<p>Finally, for 15 minutes every other day, sit in a quiet location and meditate.

Seriously.  The hours aren't quite as bad as the investment banking/corporate finance guys, but I work 13+ hours a day, and my hours are not atypical for a junior guy.  If you aren't going to work as hard as the competition, you'd better find some way to be smarter than them.<p>If you are interested in getting into option trading, make sure you understand it cold.  Know what delta, gamma, vega, and theta are.  Understand the relationship between these parameters and the price of an option: be able to explain it intuitively, and be able to derive the relationship from an option pricing formula.  Understand implied volatility and the connection between vol and option prices.  Build a simple Black-Scholes pricer to allow you to compute your own implied vol.  Know why the vol surface has the shape it does.  Make sure you realize that volatility is directional: vol goes up when markets go down.  If you are playing index options vs. single-name options, make sure you understand your correlation risk.  The list goes on and on.<p>Options are interesting, though, because they allow you to trade volatility.  Vol is a more complicated thing than simple price movement, so if you understand it well you could have an edge over your competition.<p>Finally... I think trading is a good job choice for young, ambitious, and numerically minded people.  Seems like there are a lot of readers like that here... maybe I'll write a more detailed article about this sort of thing later.",1210901264

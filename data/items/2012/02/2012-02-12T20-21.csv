My question is, is there something specific about the photography vertical which makes all the sub-niches so lucrative? For example, email newsletters: is it so popular because of the heavy amount of photography tutorials, articles, etc. available on the web and only a few other industries would experience this kind of demand in newsletters? I think photographers are the most heavy consumers of online tutorials and articles along with hackers and designers.",1329080374

A friend of mine did some work for an older version of Path.com which included an installable desktop client. One of the key features in the spec was the ability to grab the users entire address book without ever letting them know what was happening (e.g. no alerts or confirmation). This behavior wasn't a mistake or an oversight, it was completely intentional from the beginning. Of course my friend thought this was a bit shady, but the truth is that shady tactics are used all the time in the software industry for one reason - because they make money.<p>When Path states they didn't realize users would feel deceived and that they only intended to use the information to make better suggestions for the user's contact list, well, I don't want to sound cynical, but I think anyone who blindly believes these kinds of statements (from Path, Facebook, or any other company) is either personally/financially interested or extremely naive.",1329080065

That means projecting authority, the old-fashioned confidence and slightly superior air that people probably expected from a doctor in the 19th century.  He interacts differently with educated patients; they ask him all kinds of things, and he doesn't pretend to be any more wise or knowledgeable than his training makes him.  The less educated ones are likely to say nothing, nod respectfully, and then possibly not follow his advice at all if he didn't sufficiently impress them.

The result would be efficient wireless electricity transmission from any spot on the planet to any other.<p>His Wardenclyffe Tower project [2] in Long Island was an attempt to implement the idea, but was never completed due to financial problems.

This is your opportunity to talk to him about any health problems youre having. And so on.<p>In contrast, the children of poor parents may feel less entitled to this same questioning. Instead, they accept what the doctor tells them straight out, without surfacing concerns or criticisms. Gladwell then uses Chris Langan, a genius with a 195 IQ who wasnt able to succeed in college, as an example. Langan failed to get a PhD (his goal) not because he lacked intelligence, but because he had a mentality to passively accept the conditions and limitations others imposed on him. Langan ended up dropping out of college because he couldnt convince his teachers to accommodate a simple change in his schedule (a change he needed because his truck broke and he could no longer get to campus early in the morning).""",1329077925

The tool is Windows-only, they used to have a web-based version but they discontinued it (WTF Google?!). It requires 2-legged OAuth, which requires Google Apps for Business.

It's about social norms, and Google's institutional ignorance of them.<p>Privacy is created by social norms. It's no technical challenge for me to borrow your paper mail from your mailbox, steam it open, read it, copy the bits I find interesting, seal it up again, and replace it in your mailbox.

You're <i>certainly</i> expected, under pain of felony charges, not to tamper with or forge someone's email, just as you're expected to avoid entering your neighbor's house without knocking even if the front door is standing open.<p>Google, on the other hand, seems to be constantly trying to establish the precedent that it's perfectly normal and polite for any aspect of your life - currently including, but presumably not forever limited to: the state of your front yard, the contents of your photo album, the list of movies you've watched on YouTube, and the contents of your mailbox - to be sampled, data-mined, correlated, and archived forever <i>by entities completely outside your knowledge or control</i> so long as those entities are using secret algorithms to do it.<p>If you'd tolerate this behavior in a friend, you may by all means continue to have Google as a friend.

We host the sites we build as well as WordPress blogs. We charge $20/month with very low space/bandwidth limits. If we tried to be a generic host, there's not way we could compete with GoDaddy at those prices. But in a vertical, people don't mind. Even though we use expensive, managed servers from Rackspace, our margins are really good.<p><i>Email newsletters</i>: Take a look at Photojojo's ad rates: <a href=""http://photojojo.com/advertising/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photojojo.com/advertising/</a>. $6K for a 1-week sponsorship.<p><i>Forums</i>: We advertise on one paid forum that is focused on only wedding and portrait photography (a vertical of a vertical). They have roughly 5,000 members that pay $100/year + they get good advertising rates and run an annual convention. You can do the math on that.<p><i>SEO</i>: If you know SEO and/or social media, my guess is you could easily make $50K or more by publishing an ebook on ""SEO & Social Media for [insert vertical]"". I published a DVD on SEO for photographers a few years ago. I pressed 1,000 copies at Discmakers and sold them all within 18 months ... for $79/each. <a href=""http://photographyseo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photographyseo.com</a><p><i>Publishing tools</i>: This could be anything from website tools/CMSs, WordPress themes, or even tools for printing (yes, people still print stuff). One of our competitors just sells a ""WordPress theme for photographers"" ... they get $200 for a theme that is no better than themes you buy for $29 on Theme Forest. I know people that sell Photoshop templates for borders, albums and greeting cards. In my recent foray into restaurant tools, I've notice that a lot of people search for restaurant menu templates (the kind you print). I could go on and on in this section, but just know that people have all sorts of web/print/mobile/social publishing needs and are willing to pay for it.<p><i>Ecommerce</i>: Not selling things directly but helping people sell things and taking a fee. We do this at NextProof (nextproof.com). We take 7-12% of sales and <i>it's the lowest I know of in the space</i>. The forum I mentioned above has a classified ad section and it's one of the few places I trust to find used camera gear. People are used to giving Apple 30% and Groupon 50% of their sales.

That feature alone saves us innumerable hours of development and system administration.

I know it's a different situation in Europe/Asia in regards to debit vs. credit card usage, but I transact almost exclusively on credit unless it's under $5 because:<p>1) Cash Back - I get about 3-5% back on all of my purchases which adds up to a few hundred dollars a year in cashback money.
2) Fraud and Price Protection - I've had my card stolen twice and in both cases, I just reported the lost card and I had zero liability.  I also have AMEX that gives you price protection and a longer warranty for free on things you buy.
3) Credit Building - You need to build credit so having at least two credit cards in good standing with a long account history is important.  This makes financing a car/house much more easily later in life.",1329076826
